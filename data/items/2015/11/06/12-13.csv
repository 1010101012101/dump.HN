I agree that this is annoying to people accustomed to tweaking their system or desktop. No doubt. elementary OS is - at least partially - targetted at people with minimal technical knowledge. And there _are_ some design decisions I might not really agree with. The minize button, well, uhh ... I didn&#x27;t get it back via elementary-tweaks on my machines, but I understand people missing and re-activating it.<p>Now here&#x27;s the thing though: There&#x27;s a different between Apple&#x27;s walled-garden and elementary OS. You are very much able to tweak your elementary OS setup in any way you want. It&#x27;s Linux after all. It&#x27;s your system. We try to discourage tweaking a newcomer&#x27;s system via commands learned on a blog post because they&#x27;re old, outdated or plain wrong / bad. elementary-tweaks was not maintained at all for a long time as well. And there are quite a bit customizability options out there hidden in dconf. That&#x27;s what elementary-tweaks is a frontend to after all, basically.<p>I understand it&#x27;s a bit frustrating to not see the customizability in a Linux distribution you&#x27;re used to from others. You&#x27;re not exactly the target audience for elementary OS and I&#x27;m sorry for that.<p>And to be honest, there&#x27;s another spin to it: More customizability means more features maintained in the source code. And quite frankly, sometimes we&#x27;re really short of developers (I&#x27;m not contributing anything at all currently as I&#x27;m kind of busy with my apprenticeship). If nobody is going to maintain a new feature, it&#x27;s not going to be in the code because it will break one fine day and it&#x27;s adding work to the &quot;to-fix&quot; list.",1446813140

Imagine the &quot;push from right&quot; scene transition: each frame, the new scene is moved from the right to left, starting offscreen (let&#x27;s say at an x-offset of 320) and ultimately settling when the scene sits at an x-offset of 0. Each frame during this transition, the JavaScript thread needs to send a new x-offset to the main thread.

It&#x27;s easy to be impressed by fancy new css styles when you don&#x27;t use the site. Actual users of the sites were pretty dismayed by the changes.<p>Firstly they removed massive amounts of good content from government websites. For example things relevant to bootstrapping a startup like example EULAs and example contracts. As far as I can tell the logic was that it&#x27;s more economically stimulating to make everybody pay a lawyer hundreds of pounds to copy paste a copyrighted standard EULA or contract (they used a silly example about bees to try and cloud what was a major policy change about the amount of value the government online services would provide to citizens).<p>They also made it a lot harder to find a lot of the important content on the government websites. Old speeches, press releases and policy white papers etc used to be easy to find and have now mostly disappeared. Access to that kind of material is vital for people trying to hold government departments to account.<p>Secondly they are using lot of &#x27;startup best practice&#x27;. Like installing Google Analytics everywhere. Is a tracking service that reports to a corporation based in a foreign country an appropriate thing to use on government websites where you apply for passports or fill in tax returns or &#x27;anonymously&#x27; report sex crimes?<p>Thirdly the gov.uk project has extended itself to take over the online presence of what were previously independent agencies that were intended to be arms length from central government and not under direct political control.

Now I understand why I couldn&#x27;t follow the path of logic you were laying out in our original discussion in PG&#x27;s article&#x27;s comments.<p>The main problem I was having is that you are assuming our observation variable is the latent skill or potential value variable (which you&#x27;re calling x here). However, the article by PG was talking solely about the average of returns (let&#x27;s call it y).<p>So the reason I was confused is that, assuming that the outcome of a startup is dependent only on x, we are really observing y ~ f(x) = \int_0^1 g(x)h(x)dx, where h is your cut-off criteria for x, g(x) is some unknown payoff distribution for a given skill level, and I&#x27;m assuming our x is in [0,1] without loss of generality. So in essence, the real problem here, even if you could see all of the individual returns for a given portfolio, is that you have to perform a very, very difficult deconvolution problem. And I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s non-identifiable without some other information or additional parametric assumptions.<p>Thinking out loud a bit, let&#x27;s assume that y is actually log(return), where a return of 1 is breaking even and 0 is losing everything. Since log(0) is undefined, most startups return 0, and very few exit for less than 1, I would think we could model this as a point-inflated normal distribution: p(y) = c * \delta_0 + (1-c) * N(\mu, \sigma^2). Given this, we could then model our latent parameters (c, \mu, \sigma) as being functions of x. Since the model is separable, we can even just look at the zeros and non-zeros in isolation. Then we can come up with a test from there, but I&#x27;m not really sure what that test would be at this point. Anyway, that&#x27;s a completely different line of thinking, but it seems much more tractable in practice.",1446811463

An experienced web developer who has a few frameworks under their belt will have a preferred toolbox, and likely won&#x27;t be interested. Meanwhile, a beginner will have a really steep learning curve figuring all these tools out at the same time, instead of one by one, and I suspect will fall off the mountain before they reach the summit.

8193422,comment,8192928,8192928,4,0,nlh,,,"There&#x27;s no simple answer -- mostly because there are very few co-founder relationships where it&#x27;s a direct 50/50 split of the work.  One thing I&#x27;ve realized is that, like any relationship, startup relationships are based around trade-offs, and one of those trade-offs is that sometimes there&#x27;s a workload imbalance.<p>There are a few solutions for your fear (i.e. in your head).  One is don&#x27;t get involved in 50/50 relationships -- you&#x27;d be surprised how understanding folks are about this.<p>I helped start a company with some friends back in 2006 and right away it became clear that I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to commit to being involved full-time.  I was still involved, and I helped get the thing off the ground, but we all knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to make the time commitment necessary to be an equal partner in the business.  So I wasn&#x27;t!  The CEO took a larger stake in the business and I took a much smaller stake -- we were both totally OK with this, as it fairly reflected efforts put in.  (BTW - this company is now a successful venture-funded company in SV and the CEO remains one of my closest friends -- I&#x27;m a &#x27;friend of the company&#x27;, visit their offices regularly, and there isn&#x27;t an ounce of bad blood among any party whatsoever).<p>The other thing to think about if you do go the 50/50 route is that different folks have different types of contributions, and even though the hours may seem imbalanced.  For example, if you pitch 8/10 customers and your partners pitches 2/10 -- BUT...your partner lines up the funding / does all of the recruiting / balances the books if you have no accounting skills / etc., consider that raw hours might not be the best measure of &quot;effort put in&quot;.<p>So it really boils down to this:  Either go 50/50 and be comfortable that you&#x27;re each making essential contributions even though hours might not be the same, or don&#x27;t go 50/50 and instead have equity reflect contributions.",1408380705

8193419,comment,8193110,8193110,3,0,acconrad,,,"I would never recommend this arbitrary and excessively exclusionary diet plan to anyone.<p>* It does not mention quantity. You will get fat if you eat too many sweet potatoes or too much beef, yet it gives off the impression that you can eat as much of these foods as you want and &quot;get shredded&quot;.<p>* It is void of sources of healthy plant fats and protein, such as avocados, almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds and sunflower seeds.<p>* Why does fowl get subdivided (turkey vs chicken) but fish does not? There are vast varieties of fish that provide different levels of good nutrients (Vit D, Omega 3s) and bad ones (mercury). Among the best fish to eat should be further subdivided (for example, Pacific sockeye salmon has significantly more omega 3 than atlantic salmon)...and really those that have the lowest concentrations of mercury (salmon and sardines are the best bang for the buck in terms of low mercury, high omega 3 and high vitamin D).<p>* Plenty of other excellent foods are simply neglected for no reason at all. These foods include: bok choy, swiss chard and collard greens, which are extremely high in B vitamins and potassium. Others, such as beef liver and other organ meats, are exceptionally high in nutrients, but aren&#x27;t mentioned either.<p>* Perhaps worst of all, some of these foods cannot be eaten blindly, whether because of allergies, intolerances or just aren&#x27;t that nutritionally excellent. Protein powder is a convenience product and not natural food, can be difficult for people with lactose intolerance, and is often loaded with sugars and fillers, depending on the brand and type of protein. Again, some fish are high in mercury and should be consumed few and far between. Corn is the most over-produced and over-consumed carbohydrate on the planet, and if we didn&#x27;t notice from yesterday&#x27;s HN post, &quot;100% whole grain cereal&quot; is among the most nutritionally void foods ever created.<p>My best guess is that this list was hastily made without any of these important considerations, and should be flagged.",1408380642

I was ahead of the curb going in.<p>And that was the way things stayed. I stayed ahead because although the coursework was not designed for my level of knowledge, it helped a lot with filling in the holes of my knowledge. Also, the exposure and immersion and the side projects I did by myself led to many more &#x27;a-ha&#x27; moments.<p>As for the instructors, all of them were super helpful, but they might not be very approachable early-on (the first 2 weeks or so). Depending on the kind of student you are, you&#x27;ll either spend the majority of your time with the instructor learning or troubleshooting.<p>I echo @notjustanymike&#x27;s thoughts: Bootcamp learning is only skin deep.

8193408,comment,8191183,8191183,2,0,geebee,,,"I suspect this kind of janitor work is why I gravitate toward python. Even in a nice, controlled environment like kaggle, it&#x27;s remarkable how much string/text manipulation you have to do just to get a basic benchmark or cram stuff into a random forest - and that&#x27;s where the data has already been put into a text file (in my case, a csv) for you.  My guess is that it would take 10 times more data munging to get that file produced in the first place.  Python has good libraries and is very good for all that data munging.<p>Trying to outsource this stuff is appealing, I suppose, but that has turned out in my life to surprisingly difficult as well.  I once worked with a supply planning division of a manufacturing organization to try to reduce inventory by anticipating when orders would come in, so I got access to the sales database.  It appeared that there was a large spike in orders later in the quarter, and that we were carrying inventory unnecessarily.  Actually, as we discovered during a pilot, sales people who got new orders from the same customer later in the quarter would just delete and re-enter an entire order rather than doing small updates, which they found to be a hassle (this was quite a while ago, when these systems weren&#x27;t as easy to use).<p>These attempts to section off and outsource the &quot;low value&quot; work often just make things worse.

Any attempt to quantify my value based on lines of code, number of repository commits, or any other indicator is essentially meaningless without context. I may only make a single commit after a couple of weeks that changes two files and less than a dozen lines of code... but the network effects of the efficiency I just introduced allows to process N^k more data points per second which may pad your bonus with a couple of extra zeroes in the next quarter.<p>So I would recommend:<p>1. Learn how to value people differently. They bring more to the table than just a warm body.<p>2. Model the contractual obligations and profit sharing based on the core values of the business. Does working 1 hour have a directly positive impact on profits of some constant (or near-constant) amount? Split profits on hours worked. Is it more ephemeral based on the experience and qualities of the individual? Split it based on responsibility and risk (as a rule of thumb).",1408380127

You can do what they can&#x27;t (or struggle with), and vice versa. As such, I would encourage you to find a sales person/designer/hustler, as opposed to another developer.<p>On the face of it, this advice seems reasonable. But this advice will result in precisely the asymmetry to OP is worried about. If you have a technology product, I strongly discourage you from taking on a non-technical cofounder.<p>I made a huge mistake co-founding a company with someone whom I thought had a skill set that would compliment mine. He was, of course, a non-technical. While I coded for 90 hours a week trying to build an MVP, he did thought experiments, worried about competitors, and fretted about the color of our logo. In short, he did very little to move the product forward other than arbitrarily tweaking design specifications (before we had MVP and were even able to A/B test or validate with users). It was an extremely counterproductive and demoralizing experience.<p>This may sound like an edge case, but I meet people all the time whose startups failed because the team couldn&#x27;t get along. This is usually caused by one person feeling like they&#x27;re doing all the work. And that&#x27;s usually because one person IS doing all the work - the other person is a non-technical cofounder, and can&#x27;t do much meaningful work, only look busy by trying to get twitter followers, having lunch meetings with reporters, and doing competitor analysis - all work that is meaningless if you don&#x27;t have an MVP you can use to validate and iterate toward product-market fit.<p>My advice is simple: find a technical cofounder who also has the confidence to pitch. Find a technical cofounder who can help validate an MVP and iterate it to product-market fit. Find a technical cofounder who isn&#x27;t daunted by needing to pick up new skills. This is a startup. You&#x27;re looking for generalists, not specialists. Whether someone can code is a good litmus test for whether they are serious about doing tech startups, or merely dabbling.",1408378911

There is a reason physicians have tens of thousands of hours of training. We quickly learn medicine is rarely black and white and straight from the textbooks. The art of medicine is a skill that takes a lifetime to develop, and is still not perfect.<p>Sure, you can search pubmed for the best therapies, but patients often don&#x27;t know how to fully interpret a study. Was there enough power? Does the patient fit the studied population? Are the primary endpoints significant in this scenario? The knowledge is out there, but dangerous in the wrong hands.<p>Its generally a subpopulation of patients that give a reasonably self informed patient a bad reputation.

It&#x27;s quite possible it&#x27;s interacting in some subtle way with another bug, and fixing it may make the other issue start behaving more consistantly, and easier to fix.<p>It may feel wrong, because you feel like you should set that theoretically unrelated bugfix aside until you can work out the bug you&#x27;re trying to focus on.

The scribbled notes on the back of the ATM receipt in my wallet are made with the same character glyphs as I see on CAD blueprints.

8193198,comment,8192928,8192928,2,0,Iftheshoefits,,,"Here&#x27;s a specific answer to number 2, because it&#x27;s trivial: structure your business founding contracts and documents accordingly. Make sure there are clauses for vesting or share distribution that reflect what you&#x27;d find acceptable with respect to effort delivered. These documents can be as detailed and fine-grained as you like, down to the minute if you&#x27;re especially motivated/masochistic.<p>For the first question, I have a few suggestions, probably that you will not find appealing.<p>First, do try some introspection, especially with a view toward truly analyzing whether &quot;driving hard&quot;: a) means what you think it means (in the specific context of your projects) and b) is a working solution for you to accomplish your goals--I&#x27;m loathe to invoke canned/cliched nonsense, but sometimes &quot;work smarter, not harder&quot; actually does apply; c) is something you would do regardless (that is, are you the kind of person who wants to solve a problem, or are you more after the thrill of &quot;driving hard&quot; in and of itself, and so no matter what your partner(s) might do, you&#x27;re going to drive that much harder).<p>Second, seriously consider the possibility that what you need is an assistant/employee and not a co-founder. That is, consider that the breadth and depth of the projects you&#x27;re interested in, with respect to the real size of the problem and the amount of effort necessary to produce the solution, just aren&#x27;t as &quot;big&quot; as you think they are. It may be that the problems you&#x27;re solving are solvable by &quot;one person plus a little help&quot;, and don&#x27;t need more than one person &quot;driving hard.&quot; In this case, since you seem to enjoy &quot;driving hard,&quot; you&#x27;re looking for the wrong kind of partnership: you want somebody to pass off parts of the project to, but you still want to control the overwhelming majority of development.<p>Third, seriously stop and think a moment about your statement regarding how demanding &quot;the business aspects&quot; are. I&#x27;m going to be viciously blunt here: your question reads like you have a real ego problem and, unfortunately, at the same time somewhat ironically that you lack the understanding that &quot;the business aspects&quot; are actually meaningful if you want to have a &quot;big&quot; success (for certain values of &quot;big&quot;). Getting them done is <i>not</i> trivial, and certainly can be at least as demanding as the technical components of a product. That&#x27;s intentionally vague because, frankly, your question is (we don&#x27;t know what you consider a &quot;big problem&quot; is, what &quot;good money&quot; means, etc.). You&#x27;re &quot;doing fine financially&quot; as a &quot;developer/entrepreneur,&quot; so that is an indication you have at least some idea of what the non-technical &quot;business aspects&quot; of this industry are. Maybe you should try to study them so you have a more mature understanding, and therefore are less inclined to be so utterly dismissive of non-technical co-founders.",1408377690

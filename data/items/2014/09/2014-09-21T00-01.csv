My guess is that this will not be very important.  I also guess that search for Internet content based on speech and images will become more important.<p>Yes, likely Ng can get a lot of pictures of what he knows to be, say, Ferraris and use some of them as the <i>training set</i> with a neural network to \nidentify Ferraris and test the training with the rest of the pictures.  Okay.  Maybe his neural network will be able to identify Ferraris.  So, he could repeat this training for, say, 100,000 objects -- Fords, bread, airplanes, jewelery, Victorian houses, ....

Granted, modern gas-powered furnaces are usually more than 90% efficient, but there&#x27;s still some loss.</i><p>Well, heat pumps transfer <i>more than</i> 1 kWh of heat transfer for every kWh of electricity.  You have to account for the performance factor <i>anyway</i>, whether you&#x27;re using natural gas or electricity.<p>The point is that, once you&#x27;ve divided by COP or AFUE, you get price per <i>effective</i> kWh, which you can <i>then</i> compare directly.  As opposed to getting a price per therm, which you must apply a conversion factor to.<p>With cogen, you get both electricity and heating out of the unit.  If it&#x27;s all in kilowatt-hours, then you simply add them up and compare to the kWh of the incoming natural gas to get efficiency.  But how does a therm of electricity translate to volts and amps?<p>As for the kilowatt-hour, I think the reason we don&#x27;t use megajoules is that metric time never took hold.  If we had metric hours, minutes, and seconds, then the kilowatt-hour would be as awkward as the hectare-centimeter.",1411261010

Query their emotional state with a survey (or possibly by facial expressions, if that&#x27;s considered an accurate means of evaluating emotional response).

They implement the mechanism, but we still set the policy -- and we are still responsible for the consequences.<p>Now read &#x27;austinl&#x27;s comment at the top of this page, about a fictional world that cedes its <i>policy</i> decisions to AIs.  That, I would argue, is a fundamentally different thing.<p>I think there is a temptation in human psychology to want to be taken care of, to want someone (or something) else to make the hard decisions.  And I think there will be points where we&#x27;re tempted to turn our power and responsibility over to machines.<p>I also think that the concern about machines taking over is misplaced: machines, though they may one day be unimaginably more sophisticated than our current ones, will never be conscious or make conscious choices.  We will always be able to pull the plug, unless we ourselves set things up so that pulling the plug is too risky.<p>So the situation I see us in is where concern about a &quot;singularity&quot; that I don&#x27;t think will ever happen is somewhat distracting us from more important, if rather more mundane, questions about exactly which decisions we want our machines making, and which we should reserve to ourselves.

I can concisely write completely deterministic system tests that will execute tens of thousands of lines of code. I can fuzz test actor scheduling, I/O problems like dropped packets/msgs, and everything you can think of. I can run the entire test suite in valgrind and other nice tools. I can put a big machine in a corner of the office to fuzz test the suite for weeks on end and email me when a a test fails and tell me exactly which random seed to use to reproduce the failure myself within minutes. I can debug the entire simulation perfectly in GDB.<p>I&#x27;ve barely begun to describe how great it is to have, how many bugs these tests have caught or what a reliable regression test suite one can build. It doesn&#x27;t replace testing on target - I do that extensively as well. Big system scenario tests don&#x27;t replace smaller module and unit tests - I do those too.

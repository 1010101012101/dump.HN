Network delays and problems aren&#x27;t exceptional--they should be expected. It might make sense to throw an exception if you aren&#x27;t going to handle the network issue, or if you have already tried to handle it and failed. But if you&#x27;re trying to handle the issue then it shouldn&#x27;t throw an exception.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t buy this from a theoretical standpoint, you should look at your performance using this method. Exception performance is terrible in almost every language. I&#x27;m not sure how Clojure exception performance is, but guessing from Java, it&#x27;s probably not an exception (har har) to the rule.<p>I&#x27;m not a Clojure expert, but I would be really surprised if Clojure didn&#x27;t offer a non-exception way to do retries.<p>[1] <a href=""https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/tips"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/tips</a>",1425646680

Think of it not as streaming, but as a really slow and consistent huge response. HTTP2 just makes it smoother (remember: HTTP2 doesn&#x27;t change semantics, it only changes how things are represented on the wire)<p>Now, the way the demo server uses that is a bit rough; there is a specification for that in the form of Server-Sent events (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/...</a>).",1425646604

When you consider the potential of the human race and computing power to help spare daily genocide, there is clearly an opportunity to do better. If a person is driven to spend ever more time on pursuing the innovations that could theoretically lead to a singularity, what would that person say to a stadium full of children who are going to die the next day? I wouldn&#x27;t know what to say. I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;d be comforted by assurances that a byproduct of the pursuit of the singularity results in economic momentum that employs people, as good as that may be.<p>Perhaps though the attendant momentum of deep mind projects might result in AI or II be putting to the task of humanitarian relief. But my guess is that any such system would probably ask, &quot;what should the priority be for preserving life?&quot; -- and if the prioritization were done by consensus, I&#x27;m guessing that most people would prioritize preserving life over pursuing the singularity. For example, I think most people would want a self-driving AI government to prioritize their own survival over the singularity. And if that were the case, and AI were tasked with helping to &quot;load balance&quot; priorities of ethics, efforts, solutions and systems, I wonder if it might not admonish us to make changes in our life.<p>I&#x27;m not self-righteous, I&#x27;m self-unrighteous. I&#x27;m just beginning to question my general acceptance of wherever technology goes, wherever I spend my time. I don&#x27;t presume to tell people what to do, but I do propose that the ethic of choosing whether to relieve a suffering child right in front of you may be self-evident to some people -- and if so, that realizing children are at arm&#x27;s length, that we can do something about it, may convince some people, myself included, to think about &quot;re-balancing&quot; priorities.<p>I read fiction regularly. I would be a hypocrite to judge anyone for &quot;not spending enough time relieving suffering&quot;. Yet overall I question how content and comfortable I am with life. I guess in a portfolio of effort, I hope that the allocation of assets in my own life and others would place a primary emphasis on sustainability that includes the relief of suffering.

9156746,comment,9155964,9155964,0,0,jasim,,,"&quot;I became, in fact, less and less of a programmer at all, and more and more simply a procedure-writer who tacked together canned routines or previously debugged POGOL steps to do dull things in a dull way&quot;. This was when the author had to work with layers of accidental complexity of the IBM 360s, before discovering Unix. It gives hope to know that such complexity existed even in 1978, but that it was simply bad engineering, as the advent of Unix later proved.<p>I marked two snippets from Coders at Work where Guy Steele and Ken Thompson both lament the increasing number of layers in modern computing. It is perhaps inevitable, but it is worth wondering at.<p>##<p>Seibel: What has changed the most in the way you think about programming now, vs. then? Other than learning that bubble sort is not the greatest sorting technique.<p>Steele: I guess to me the biggest change is that nowadays you can&#x27;t possibly know everything that&#x27;s going on in the computer. There are things that are absolutely out of your control because it&#x27;s impossible to know everything about all the software. Back in the &#x27;70s a computer had only 4,000 words of memory. It was possible to do a core dump and inspect every word to see if it was what you expected. It was reasonable to read the source listings of the operating system and see how that worked. And I did that—I studied the disk routines and the card-reader routines and wrote variants of my own. I felt as if I understood how the entire IBM 1130 worked. Or at least as much as I cared to know. You just can&#x27;t do that anymore.<p>##<p>Seibel: Reading the history of Unix, it seems like you guys basically invented an operating system because you wanted a way to play with this computer. So in order to do what today might be a very basic thing, such as write a game or something on a computer, well, you had to write a whole operating system. You needed to write compilers and build a lot of infrastructure to be able to do anything. I&#x27;m sure all of that was fun for its own sake. But I wonder if maybe the complexity of modern programming that we talked about before, with all these layers that fit together, is that just the modern equivalent of, “Well, first step is you have to build your own operating system”? At least you don&#x27;t have to do that anymore.<p>Thompson: But it&#x27;s worse than that. The operating system is not only given; it&#x27;s mandatory. If you interview somebody coming out of computer science right now, they don&#x27;t understand the underlying computing at all. It&#x27;s really, really scary how abstract they are from what a computer is or even the theory of computing. They just don&#x27;t understand it.<p>Seibel: I was thinking about your advice to your son to go into biology instead of computing. Isn&#x27;t there something about programming—the intellectual fun of defining a process that can be enacted for you by these magical machines—that&#x27;s the same whether you&#x27;re operating very close to the hardware or at an abstract level?<p>Thompson: It&#x27;s addictive. But you wouldn&#x27;t want to tell your kid to go into crack. And I think it&#x27;s changed. It might just be my aging, but it seems like when you&#x27;re just building another layer on top of another layer on top of another layer, you don&#x27;t really get the benefit of writing, say, a DFA. I think by necessity algorithms—new algorithms are just getting more complex over time. A new algorithm to do something is based on 50 other little algorithms. Back when I was a kid you were doing these little algorithms and they were fun. You could understand them without it being an accounting job where you divide it up into cases and this case is solved by this algorithm that you read about but you don&#x27;t really know and on and on. So it&#x27;s different. I really believe it&#x27;s different and most of it is because the whole thing is layered over time and we&#x27;re dealing with layers. It might be that I&#x27;m too much of a curmudgeon to understand layers.",1425645955

Why do women live longer than men? What is the significance of the menopause? Answers to these questions may be sought by reference to the mechanisms by which human aging might have evolved. Here, an evolutionary hypothesis is presented that could answer all three questions, based on the following suppositions. First, that the evolution of increased human longevity was driven by increased late-life reproduction by men in polygynous primordial societies. Second, that the lack of a corresponding increase in female reproductive lifespan reflects evolutionary constraint on late-life oocyte production. Third, that antagonistic pleiotropy acting on androgen-generated secondary sexual characteristics in men increased reproductive success earlier in life, but shortened lifespan. That the gender gap in aging is attributable to androgens appears more likely given a recent report of exceptional longevity in eunuchs. Yet androgen depletion therapy, now used to treat prostatic hyperplasia, appears to accelerate other aspects of aging (e.g. cardiovascular disease). One possibility is that low levels of androgens throughout life reduces aging rate, but late-life androgen depletion does not.&quot;",1425645168

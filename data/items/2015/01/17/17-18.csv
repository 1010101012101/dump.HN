I do, however, spend a lot of time in Scala-land, where Akka is king (for better or worse) and tries to pull a lot of the same principles into the JVM. Have you ever looked at it? I&#x27;m curious how it feels to somebody who&#x27;s worked extensively in Erlang.<p>I think PG&#x27;s Blub Paradox only works to a point, as you say, and I think you nailed what regularly drives me nuts about technology: there are axes to this stuff that people mash into a continuum to feed their (rampant) insecurities--so they can look down on <i>somebody</i>. I think it&#x27;s a sign of cultural and personal immaturity. I thought it was super-cool to issue sweeping statements about technologies at one point, and sometimes I still fall into it when I&#x27;m feeling salty, but I try not to. Which is different from sweeping statements about the <i>craft</i> of programming; Gary Bernhardt&#x27;s twitter feed is chock-full of things that as a programmer you really should full-stop <i>not do</i> to your users. But technology--ehh. I goof on Go a lot, and it does drive me squirrelly when I have to debug somebody&#x27;s Go project for work, but I just can&#x27;t cape for any particular stack anymore. Even Java has plenty of uses. (For me, Java&#x27;s useful in that I can see in my head roughly what the bytecode output of a given thing, and reason about its behaviors on the JVM better than I can Scala.)",1421517550

And the only entity able to sue under civil law would be the heirs of the photographer, who are unlikely to know that they hold the copyright.  The public, while potentially deprived of the the ability to make use of the work, is not deemed to &quot;have standing&quot;.<p>The seminal paper on the topic calls this &quot;copyfraud&quot;:<p><pre><code>  Copyfraud\n  Jason Mazzone, University of Illinois College of Law\n  Brooklyn Law School, Legal Studies Paper No. 40 \n  New York University Law Review, Vol. 81, p. 1026, 2006 \n\n  Abstract:      \n\n  Copyfraud is everywhere. False copyright notices appear on \n  modern reprints of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, Beethoven&#x27;s piano \n  scores, greeting card versions of Monet&#x27;s Water Lilies, and \n  even the U.S. Constitution. Archives claim blanket \n  copyright in everything in their collections. Vendors of \n  microfilmed versions of historical newspapers assert \n  copyright ownership. These false copyright claims, which \n  are often accompanied by threatened litigation for \n  reproducing a work without the owner&#x27;s permission, result \n  in users seeking licenses and paying fees to reproduce  \n  works that are free for everyone to use. \n\n  Copyright law itself creates strong incentives for \n  copyfraud. The Copyright Act provides for no civil penalty \n  for falsely claiming ownership of public domain materials. \n  There is also no remedy under the Act for individuals who \n  wrongly refrain from legal copying or who make payment for \n  permission to copy something they are in fact entitled to \n  use for free. While falsely claiming copyright is \n  technically a criminal offense under the Act, prosecutions \n  are extremely rare. These circumstances have produced fraud \n  on an untold scale, with millions of works in the public \n  domain deemed copyrighted, and countless dollars paid out \n  every year in licensing fees to make copies that could be \n  made for free. Copyfraud stifles valid forms of \n  reproduction and undermines free speech. \n\n  Congress should amend the Copyright Act to allow private \n  parties to bring civil causes of action for false copyright \n  claims. Courts should extend the availability of the \n  copyright misuse defense to prevent copyright owners from \n  enforcing an otherwise valid copyright if they have engaged \n  in past copyfraud. In addition, Congress should further \n  protect the public domain by creating a national registry \n  listing public domain works and a symbol to designate those \n  works.

It&#x27;s volatility is partly due to the difficulty increase and reward halving part of the protocol. I.e. the part designed to reward early adopters. Which was necessary to bootstrap it.<p>It&#x27;s a speculative game for the first maybe decade or two. As the bitcoins gradually leave the early adopters as they cave in to whatever price is worth it for them there are bubble cycles. Once there is more general adoption, it will settle down though. As people gradually start to think less in e.g. Euros and consider not changing directly into local currency, but just to hold some for their day-to-day transactions because they are particularly useful in certain circumstances.<p>Once it&#x27;s passed a tipping point they will be more useful in more and more situations, to the point that it&#x27;s easier to just have your smart phone and cursing cash or credit card only places. I&#x27;m sure there will be retro hipster bars that take cash only in the future.<p>Anyway, as for the remaining volatility, it may just be that bitcoins serve as gold and another somehow regulated cryptocurrency serves as ordinary money.",1421516610

I came to programming in middle school with not much more than average knowledge of using a computer. I could fix the family&#x27;s wifi, but had never touched a command line. So I had to learn all the underpinnings of a computer at the same time.  I enjoyed both immensely, but at times it was tedious, and I had to push through that to get to the parts that I now really enjoy.<p>I know a lot of people that have quit, deciding coding wasn&#x27;t for them, when they hit those tedious bits of understanding a file system and command line.<p>It&#x27;s just like getting through the phase of learning an instrument where you have to struggle to remember chords and where notes are and build muscle memory.

Best way to describe it is that it&#x27;s similar to the copyright that a company (back in the day) that created what is known as a reverse phone directory. That&#x27;s where you could find someone&#x27;s phone number by address (or address by phone number). The point being that even though all the info is public (anyone can input same info from a free phone directory) the act of organizing it and displaying it in a certain way (reversed by address as only one example) gives you copyright over the presentation of the material.  So you can&#x27;t grab that wholesale.<p>Another example that I can think of is dnjournal.com which publishes a list of domain sales which they gather primarily (but not exclusively) from easily available info from other sources (like sedo.com). So you are free to do the same from the same sources. However you can&#x27;t take the list they created, that is lift it from their site, and publish it without violating their copyright.<p>There may of course be some other principle involved obviously but off the top the above seems possible.<p>Edit: Appears what I am referring to is possibly a version of &quot;derivative&quot; work:<p><a href=""https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/what-are-derivative-works-under-copyright-law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/what-are-derivative-works...</a><p>I think this also goes under &quot;the golden rule&quot; meaning he who has the gold rules.

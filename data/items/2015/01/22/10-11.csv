8928480,comment,8926056,8927351,0,0,aceperry,,,"If anything, Nadella presents a vastly different attitude from MS than the previous CEOs.  For one thing, I haven&#x27;t seen the incredible arrogance towards other companies and technologies that MS has had in the past.  Such as when Ballmer promised to kill linux, and called open source software a cancer.  Now MS is open sourcing a lot of software.<p>Another thing that Nadella is doing is pushing new technologies and ideas which is not usually seen from MS.  As the article mentions, MS was usually playing catch up or me too.  These are promising changes, but still, because MS has been a fierce competitor who pretty much screwed over a lot of their partners and other companies that they&#x27;ve done business with, they became one of the most feared companies in the tech field.  I&#x27;m left with the sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Maybe one of the reasons for that is the way MS pushed Windows 8 and their tablets.  I&#x27;ve seen the corporate speak and boosterism that their people have been spouting when it first came out.  Although it was still under Ballmer&#x27;s reign, they are recent enough to make me wonder how quickly MS people can change under Nadella.  Or if they&#x27;ll even change.  Nadella needs to make a huge impression to both the public as well as to MS employees if he&#x27;s going to really change the culture and business practices of MS.

I released a fork of Fluxxor a while ago with Mixin support [1] but it is unlikely to make it until 2.0.<p>The other nice parts to my eyes are:<p>State Mixins - sort of a hybrid between Fluxxor&#x27;s StoreWatchMixin and Fluxxor-autobind [2]<p>Constants - This is a new one, I like it.

This being the first of its kind, the implementation probably would be worst-case for both reading and writing (wait for the &#x27;start of memory&#x27; marker, count bits until the ones needed come along)<p>And of course, it had to read its instructions from the same wire.

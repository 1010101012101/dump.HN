7209878,comment,7209553,7209749,19,0,x0054,,,"> That is obviously the answer because, hey, it worked for Apple, right?<p>The fact is, it really didn&#x27;t work for Apple. Short of a few common design choices, iOS and OSX are very different, and for a good reason. I am not sure why it&#x27;s not obvious to people. Mouse or keyboard driven UI can be much smaller and tighter, with a lot less chrome, to allow more room for data. Touch UI has to be chunkier by default. The simple truth is Metro UI works amazing on a touch device, I love it. Windows 7 works just fine on PC. What Microsoft really needed is 2 separate operating systems, just like apple. The Windows line could have been updated with a fresh skin, more stability improvements, and some core new features here and there. The Metro OS could have been a separate OS for the Phone, Tablet, and TV markets. Instead Microsoft now has 4 incompatible OS lines which all function very different, but look identical, only adding to the confusion:<p>1. Windows 8 - For PCs, Tablets, and God knows what else,<p>2. Windows RT - For Tablets which are not as nice as the Windows 8 tablets but can run some of the same software, but not all of it, and some apps which work on the RT actually do not run on Windows 8 tablets, and, so ..... yeah.<p>3. Windows Phone 8 - Exclusively for phones. For convenience, incompatible with Windows Phone 7 and 7.5.<p>4. XBox OS - Runs only on XBox, looks like Windows 8, but works very different.<p>So, instead of 2 visually distinct operating systems, Microsoft now has 4 visually similar operating systems. I can see their logic, they wanted to leverage their huge PC instal base to drag some users to their Tablet and Phone products. Much like Apple is using iPods to sell people on iPhones and iPads, and perhaps later, Macs. But the problem is, they are not really achieving that goal, while pissing of their core PC customers.",1392022518

No matter what the question is their answer is always the same.\nWindows.<p>Need a phone OS? - Windows\nNeed a Tablet OS? - Windows\nNeed a Desktop OS? - Windows\nNeed a Server OS? - Windows<p>Windows, Windows, Windows. It&#x27;s supposed to be all things to all people. And it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore. You&#x27;re right, on the desktop nothing beats Windows. Even on the Server Windows is fine. But when they try to force Windows on to phones and tablets everything starts to fall apart. It isn&#x27;t suited for mobile devices. It&#x27;s too big, to bloated for mobile. And it&#x27;s interface is terrible for mobile, but great for the desktop. So they come out with a new interface that&#x27;s fine for phones but sucks on a desktop.<p>JUST STOP THE INSANITY.<p>You are exactly right. Focus Windows on productivity and the corporate market. If Microsoft feels that they have to get into mobile fine, come out with a mobile OS. But don&#x27;t throw out the baby with the bath water. Leave the damn desktop alone.&quot;<p>In short, Windows 8 solved no real pressing problems for users - it solved - or was supposed to solve problems for Microsoft - which is to say a lack of penetration in what all the kids these days (and pundits) say is the environment of the future - mobile.<p>Microsoft has, and will have the enterprise and most of the desktop market locked up for the near future - for all the apps out there for whichever mobile platform, they pale in software for PC and the overall power and usability of the traditional desktop/laptop computer paradigm - and likely will for the foreseeable future.",1392022474

I recently spent a year with an OSX laptop, and it was a merciful relief when I was finally able to get the hell out of iLand. My first love is KDE because it <i>bows</i> to my will like nothing else, as a good window-manager/OS <i>should</i>.  Win8 is also pretty malleable, even though it&#x27;s not so good for those lacking the chops to bend it to their will.

Windows is eminently <i>customizable</i>.  If you aren&#x27;t a complete n00b you can bend Windows to suit yourself far more easily than OSX.  KDE absolutely spanks them both, but still...   I would wholeheartedly recommend OSX or iOS to my grandmother, because she&#x27;s not so good at customizing things.

That may not be a huge problem if it was only the core base (although needing 16GB of space, something that&#x27;s still the default for &quot;high-end mobile devices&quot; today, just for Windows alone, still sucks), but it gets much worse when they also want to have the &quot;same UI on everything&quot;, which just doesn&#x27;t work and never has. Even on the web, we still get to talk about &quot;responsive design&quot;, because the same UI doesn&#x27;t work on mobile devices, and it needs to be adapted for that form factor.<p>Problem #2: Having basically 2 operating systems in one, and <i>forcing</i> the user to switch from one to the other, by nagging him with all sorts of bad UX elements (charms on the desktop has always been a terrible idea to me, for example, and the UI looks completely out of place, too).<p>Problem #3: Price. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re &quot;feeling&quot; this yet or not, but I think they are. If Windows for tablets cost $90 to license, then Windows tablets are simply not competitive from the get go. Yes, you may see some $300 Windows tablet, but it usually has much worse specs and quality than a $300 Android tablet. As I said, not competitive.

Also looking at Proton [1] and Allegro [2] for similar reasons. And just came across a Blackberry-backed engine [3] which looks interesting (and also Lua-driven).<p>I actually have my OWN game engine (based on LuaJIT, thank you ;) that already targets Windows, Android, and iOS, but I&#x27;d like to rip out the platform layer and replace it with something that someone <i>else</i> is maintaining. I mean, it <i>works</i> now, but leveraging open source and other developers&#x27; efforts would be much better.<p>I&#x27;ve considered just using SDL 2.0 and calling it good, but I&#x27;m tempted to pick up some of the higher-level functionality some of these other engines offer.<p>None offer <i>all</i> the features I want, unfortunately. One of the big features they mostly miss is <i>really</i> good script/C++ cross-functionality. Aside from that, there are typically one or two other things that make me want to avoid them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rtsoft.com/wiki/doku.php?id=proton"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rtsoft.com/wiki/doku.php?id=proton</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://alleg.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alleg.sourceforge.net/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.gameplay3d.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gameplay3d.org/</a>",1392019522

The iPhone has shown that business customers go home, buy consumer products, love how much better it works than what they use at the office and want to bring it to work. The recent data on mobile device sales compared to Windows PCs is especially damning.<p>Secondly, Google, Facebook and the rest of &quot;new tech&quot; industry is not built on MS tech. What is actually enterprise? Size? If a gigantic company like Google can crunch all that data and have such amazing uptime without MS tech, then who needs MS? Every year a new generation create their own startup and they choose anything but MS. To me, enterprise means established, old and slow. If all the old guards will be disrupted and die out like I think they will, then MS will have no one left to sell to! Increasingly even the old guard is messing around with Linux and OSS in order to be more agile.<p>Consumer is the future and MS needs to embrace it or die. They just have to stop making mistakes like Windows 8.",1392019483

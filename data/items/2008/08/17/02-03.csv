Like the story says, there are lots of potential ways to monetize the service.",1218941986

A request for multiline string literals is over 7 years old...<p><a href=""http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4472509"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4472509</a><p>Reading the Sun bug database, it's clear who's held back Java's functionality and stability over the years: xxxxx@xxxxx, who on this issue back in 2001 wrote ""This is yet another request for a syntactic sugar to save some user from typing. It's not worth it.""<p>I hope for the good of the platform xxxxx has been let go since then.",1218941663

I wonder if it is getting old now though- some of the cutting edge phenomenon he wrote about is much more developed today.<p>Ray Kurzweil (not very openly) critiques these kinds of books as lacking scientific backing for their claims.",1218941485

If Warner Music wants to charge $5 a play for Mylie Cyrus, I'm certainly not going to pay it, but how is it ""wrong""?<p>I'm surprised and happy that Pandora and Last.fm can exist at all, but I don't understand what <i>entitles</i> them to exist. We don't have a ""right"" to consume major label music.",1218941478
278138,comment,278120,278134,0,0,netcan,,,"I think it comes back to not really wanting the internet to happen. And not necessarily irrationally.<p>The recording industry world has been in a pretty sweat spot. The current (& past) world creates a substantial income built on 1. selling albums, 2. strict adherance to a 90/10 rule (revenue/artists), 3. Periphery industries that support 1 & 2 (eg: movie soundtracks, radio).<p>Almost any step is a step away from that cushy world. So any slowing of change is good.",1218941213

278135,comment,277984,277984,0,0,waldrews,,,"It's a little surprising how many of the Python-favoring features are already present in C# 3.0; closures, syntactically clean properties, and a nicer array syntax; between the yield keyword and LINQ, you get something close to generator syntax; reflection is pretty painless; and while there's no dynamic typing, there's a convenient type inference mechanism.<p>My personal pet peeve against Java is the lack of multiline string literals, also available in both Python and C#.<p>Java has some syntactic catching up to do.",1218940548
278134,comment,278120,278120,0,0,gigawatt,,,"I can't for the life of me understand why SoundExchange thinks that charging exorbitant rates that force all web streaming music sites out of business will help its artists make more money. 8/100 of a cent x millions of songs played is infinitely better than 19/100 of a cent x ZERO songs played.

278125,comment,277742,278027,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"it's not even that it is boring.  it's that it is not really a game.  MMO's tap into the same compulsion that cults often do, put a little number next to someone's name and they will kill themselves trying to make it higher (or lower as the case may be).  In the case of WoW, this has been perfected to an art.  You're always just a little bit of playtime away from making some number related to your character go higher.  It's basically a drug.",1218939288

278119,comment,277959,277959,0,0,babul,,,"Teams that play together, stay together. It is all about the relationship people have with one another. We all have different strengths and weaknesses and essentially it is about knowing each other well enough to compensate for one and other, know what people can and cannot do, and create unity through this diversity and iteratively build on competencies. That is how great teams are built, and great things are made.<p>Articles like this in essence create a divide in thinking (them/us, execs/techs, etc.), which maybe reflective of some big work places where people work with strangers, but which do not have to exist (especially in smaller businesses).<p>Think of the early days of many of the great companies today. They often had people with diverse talents, and created great things because of harmony rather than divide.",1218938602

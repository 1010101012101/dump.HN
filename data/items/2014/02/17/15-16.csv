7252626,comment,7252061,7252288,4,0,tmoertel,,,"The QuickCheck style of testing is my favorite (see paper [1]). Using a simple embedded DSL, you write specifications that declare the desired properties of your code. The computer then checks that the properties hold by randomly sampling the space of possible test cases, using one of several sampling strategies.  Even though the checks are not proofs, they are very effective in practice.<p>For example, here&#x27;s a quick Haskell session in which I claim that the function <i>f</i> has the property of returning its smaller argument:<p><pre><code>    Prelude> import Test.QuickCheck\n    Prelude> let prop_minWins x y = if x < y then f x y == x else f x y == y\n    Prelude> quickCheck prop_minWins\n    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.\n</code></pre>\nThe best part is that the property specifications are not only machine testable but human readable. They allow you to tell other humans what you code should do, using a clear, formal language that the machine can check to make sure you didn&#x27;t tell any lies. For example, the second line in the code sample above says, &quot;For all <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> (which are values of some type on which there is a less-than relation), if <i>x</i> < <i>y</i> then <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = <i>x</i>; otherwise, \n<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = <i>y</i>. See [2] for another great example.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/courses/395-495-2009-fall/quick.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/courses/395-495-2009...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Text-ParserCombinators-ReadP.html#g%3A5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Text-Pa...</a>",1392652695

If you haven&#x27;t read Ptolomy (and in particular all of Tetrabiblos, the Almagest, and his Geographia), you really should.  Ptolomy was quite an incredibly observant individual and he worked through things with an attention to detail that is quite impressive.<p>He clearly understood he was in the Northern Hemisphere, but he placed Alexandria not in the southernmost part of the known world as the article suggests but in the center.  A lot of this was pride and the sense that the center had everything good from the edges (see Tetrabiblos), but to some extent everywhere is the center, right?<p>He painstakingly discusses the proof that the earth is a sphere in Almagest.  His geographia is worth reading and directly relevant to this.<p>I suspect that Ptolomy put the north at the top simply because he was in the Northern Hemisphere and knew it.  He displays no great knowledge of navigation, though he does explain how the stars shift as you move north and south (again see Tetrabiblos and Almagest), and he even seemed to be aware that Mercury and Venus revolved around the sun (or so he seemed to say in Tetrabiblos).<p>All in all he&#x27;s one of those authors one really has to read if one is interested in history, even the seemingly weird works he wrote (Tetrabiblos is an astrology manual but includes a lot of information about Ptolomy&#x27;s understanding of geography not found in Geographia, and astronomy not found in Almagest).",1392652253

7252580,comment,7248829,7251663,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"I think you&#x27;re slightly misunderstanding me. I&#x27;ll chalk that up to my not being as clear as I could have been.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about stealing from competition. What I&#x27;m saying is that <i>every</i> startup is solving a pain point or a need-state of some sort. That&#x27;s the reason for the existence of the startup in the first place. You might have competitors attempting to solve the same pain point in the same way, and you might not. Either way, you&#x27;re trying to solve a pain point.<p>How do you gauge the validity of your product and find your first 100 users? You do this by gauging the validity of the pain point you&#x27;ve identified. You do this because, in a sense, the value of your product is the delta between Your Solution and User Pain. Nine times out of ten, users have an existing solution (or behavior) they&#x27;re doing to try to solve the pain -- but your product is going to be better, or at least you hope.<p>Let&#x27;s look at your iPod example. There were some MP3 players in the market before the iPod launched, but for the sake of argument, we&#x27;ll say that these players were insignificant at the time. So what was the pain point, and what was the existing solution, when Apple launched the iPod? The pain point was not being able to take your music library on the go -- most people had to make do with a single CD at a time. Their existing solutions? Walkmen, portable radios, MP3 collections on their computers, and so forth. What was Apple&#x27;s solution? &quot;1,000 songs in your pocket.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a common misconception that Apple &quot;creates new markets&quot; by bringing entirely-new-to-the-world products to everybody at once. Yes, they can do that now. They&#x27;ve got billions of dollars, a well-oiled marketing and distribution machine, their own highly successful sales channel, and distribution at every major retailer in the country. But that wasn&#x27;t the case back in 2001. When Apple launched the iPod, it <i>didn&#x27;t</i> launch to &quot;everybody.&quot; It had to start with a segment of the market, which in 2001, was a relatively small set of Mac users and early tech adopters with big MP3 collections. It addressed and added more segments over the next few years, slowly building a snowball into critical mass, which it wouldn&#x27;t achieve until roughly 2004-2006.<p>Most startups are like Apple in 2001, not Apple in 2014. They don&#x27;t have a megaphone they can shout from. Their customer set isn&#x27;t the set of basically all consumers. In the long run, sure, that&#x27;s a fantastic place to be. But you have to start somewhere a lot more specific.<p>Which brings me back to the original topic: how do you get your first 100 users? The best way to get them is to assess which subset of users you believe will have the <i>biggest</i> delta between your value proposition and an existing need or pain. That&#x27;s all I was trying to say. It&#x27;s not about &quot;stealing someone else&#x27;s customers,&quot; per se. It&#x27;s about solving needs. In the long run, maybe a billion people have this need, and you&#x27;re indeed opening up a new market. Awesome. But you can&#x27;t start there.

Reviewing where Android was when it launched, a good few years after these events, and you can only conclude Samsung were 100% right. Android had a slow VM (far slower than the others already in the market) very high system requirements, and represented a whole new incompatible ecosystem.<p>Much of the world had moved on to J2ME&#x27;s MIDP 2.0, with Japan and the US the notable exceptions with i-mode and Qualcomm&#x27;s C based Brew platform respectively. As later happened with Android the fragmentation problems of J2ME were greatly exaggerated by a whole mini industry of companies reliant on the illusion. J2ME certainly had problems, but if you were delivering more than 100 different builds (I&#x27;m aware of groups pushing 1000) then you were completely and absolutely insane. It might sound like creating 100 different builds would be a big problem, but the differences were really fairly trivial, and not much worse than Android today which primarily benefits from most of the OS having been written by one group, except for the driver layers, whereas previously a lot more was on the OEM.<p>I&#x27;m a fairly loud proponent of the merits of Android, but what is even more widely ignored is that J2ME was in many ways superior to it, most obviously in the way it handled application permissions. For those that have dug into the platform it&#x27;s amazingly clear that without the iPhone coming along and spurring Google on to greater things Android would have been a complete non-event at launch, especially with the dire performance of the early devices. The concern for Android developers today is that now Google have done just enough to edge out the iPhone in the market (though not in terms of developer experience, thanks to the giant incoherent mess of an API) they&#x27;re leaving the platform to stagnate. Perversely the best thing for Android devs right now would be if Apple or MS produce an absolutely killer version of their respective OS&#x27;s forcing Google to invest where it&#x27;s needed to stay in contention.<p>So I certainly wouldn&#x27;t rate Samsung as a software outfit, they&#x27;re notably terrible, but Google have caught many of the old MS diseases, especially when it comes to doing only enough to destroy competitors and then leaving it hanging. If you compare the iOS and Android APIs you can&#x27;t escape the conclusion that the iOS team have pride in their work, and the Android team are constantly having to make excuses for what a rush they were in. Both groups drove the other to greater heights, but the impact both eventually had in the market is only thanks to the other having driven them to get there.",1392651534

Did you actually <i>read</i> the post you&#x27;re criticizing instead of just jumping at the first critical points he makes about git because it happens to be your favorite tool? No argument you list here is in any way contradicting to what the post says.<p>To summarize again, the post says: Git is more powerful because it&#x27;s distributed - but that comes at a price in terms of a more complex UI. If you know that you&#x27;ll never need DVCS, you might be better off using SVN.<p>Everything <i>you</i> are listing here is examples of how git&#x27;s UI is more complex, except you don&#x27;t seem to recognize it anymore because git has become so engrained in what you do. Every so often it&#x27;s worth it to take a step back, to look at our workflows and to figure out why we do what we do for every step.

At a low-enough level, every operation is destructive, because that&#x27;s how our machines work. If you&#x27;re using immutable data-structures, then you&#x27;re allocating memory, so you are bumping (destructively) some heap pointer. Even if that pointer is thread-local, sooner or later some garbage collection will take place, which requires some form of synchronization.<p>The idea is that somewhere in your software stack, be it the OS or the JVM or whatever, there will be shared mutable state, and that&#x27;s where lock-free data structures are handy. Some high-level languages abstract that away from you so you don&#x27;t have to deal with this stuff.<p>Also, parallelism is only part of the story. Parallelism, or data parallelism, divides the data so that it can be processed cooperatively in parallel, but that&#x27;s not always what you have. Lock-free data structures are useful when doing concurrency rather than parallelism, i.e. lots of different computations (rather than one), competing for (rather than cooperatively sharing) limited resources.",1392651402

The limitations they have is in the amount of energy required to create the object and whatever items they are restricted from creating. So the replicators in rooms only have access to enough energy to create typical items you might need your room. Although I believe they can create weapons as well but that would be restricted if your restricted to your quarters due to misconduct. If you require bigger and/or more complex items there are one or more locations on the ship that function as &quot;shops&quot; were you can obtain such items. Plus there&#x27;s a theory that hasn&#x27;t been shown anywhere that I&#x27;m aware of is that there are large replicators on ships that are capable of creating parts for the ship which would make sense. Star ships would be created with very large part replicators located at orbiting ship yards. Not large enough replicator nor energy source to just create an entire ship from a replicator.<p>You could replicate a living being because that&#x27;s the same technology used in the transporters. Beaming down to a planet and back means they replicated you twice.

There could be a discussion over what the &quot;characters&quot; inside the holodeck actually are as they are most likely created with the same technology and have been shown to become self-aware. There have been suggestions that these &quot;characters&quot; are in fact real people but as far as I know they never directly addressed exactly what they are in terms of &quot;living beings&quot; or not. Other suggestions from the show suggest they could be projections and contact with them is handled via clever uses of shield technology but I&#x27;d like to know how they simulate the feeling of warm skin with shields.

This is true for Canada, Germany, Norway, etc.I do not know if life expectancy is a measure for quality of health care, but it is at least an indicator of how good the general health is.<p>I agree. Actually Poland which is 2nd world country really, has better life expectancy that USA! However, this doesn&#x27;t mean that Polish healthcare system is superior to American. This means that if all you do whole life is eating, stressing out at work, having no friends with family 2 time zones away, and zero exercise - even the best healthcare system in the world won&#x27;t help you. So while I agree that people live longer in most civilized places than in the US, I still claim that the US healthcare system as long as money isn&#x27;t a major concern for you - it is just the best system in the world, period. But even they can&#x27;t help you if you have been on McDonald&#x27;s diet foe the past 20 years and the most exercise you do is 10 meters from home to car.<p>> On a personal note I would say that my experience with the US health care system has left a lot to be desired, and I experienced the care as better in my native Norway. That said, my girlfriend is a doctor and her health plan seems a lot better so my experience can be anecdotal.<p>Not sure how good they would be about it in Norway, but in the US they diagnosed me with Ehlers Danlos type 2 in a matter of weeks while in Poland literally dozens of doctors I visited didn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on. In my particular case, where the condition in from 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 50,000 the major incentive to find out what&#x27;s wrong with me for the doctors was really fear for me suing them. Again, money in this system really works both ways. I said my insurance company, you test me genetically for ehlers danlos or I sue your ass. They paid $6k for testing and I was tested positive. From perspective now I think that in Poland some doctors at least knew or suspected my condition but had no incentive to do anything. And money or loosing it is a great incentive.",1392649895

Specifically because they would often have people come into the community with some grand plans that would have just exploded the scope.<p>It is of course arguable to what extent there could be a general rule to this, but in this case, GIT is just so fundamentally and obviously the better option than SVN. Had somebody tried to make SVN into GIT, it would have simply killed SVN, so it was the right course of action to make it a new project. SVN was destined to die by its design.<p>To see the GIT adoption rates these days (particularly due to tools like GitHub) is very encouraging to people who like to think that sometimes, starting over fresh is the only option. Of course, the thing you want to build really has to be that much better than the old thing you&#x27;re trying to replace.<p>So I agree with you - it&#x27;s alright to say that GIT is better than SVN.

PHP fails to support, or supports quite poorly, many semantics which more competently designed languages handle well. If PHP is your primary, or worse your <i>only</i>, programming language, then this deficit leaves you at a disadvantage when it comes to growing more skilled in your craft, because after a while you&#x27;re not learning new things which generalize across languages, but rather learning how to work around the famously irreducible piles of manure unique to PHP.<p>You can get quite good at doing that, of course, and it&#x27;s even a useful professional skill, there being so much PHP code in the world, and most of it awful. But doing so does not make you a better <i>programmer</i>, because at best it teaches you nothing useful about how to use less programmer-hostile languages, and at worst it inculcates habits which will prove actively harmful in any later effort to develop skills in such languages.<p>That you are unable to appreciate this qualitative distinction does nothing to erase its existence, but it does provide an excellent example of the conceptual deficiencies which result from a PHP-centric perspective on programming -- even something as trivial as proper first-class functions you dismiss as &quot;cooking unicorns in fairy sauce&quot;, and since PHP doesn&#x27;t have them, how would you know otherwise?<p>Whether you choose to address these deficits in your education is, of course, entirely your lookout. I&#x27;m just here to point out that they exist. You&#x27;re free to argue otherwise, should you so choose, but you&#x27;ll be wrong to do so; I speak here from experience gained in working with people who similarly mistook PHP for a worthwhile general-purpose web development language, who began their programming careers by specializing in it, and who in so doing unwittingly stunted their professional growth in precisely the manner I describe. Some overcame it, and matured into truly professional programmers with whom it was a pleasure to work; some did not, and most of those, as far as I&#x27;ve been able to keep track, eventually drifted out of the field entirely. All, having been seduced by that syphilitic temptress of innocents we call PHP, suffered unduly as a result. (I&#x27;d have been among them myself if not for early exposure to Perl, which for all its warts is a thousand times preferable to PHP; having cut my teeth on a language which is merely bad, I was equipped in my first encounter with PHP to recognize the legendarily awful when I saw it.)<p>It&#x27;s for reasons like these that, to borrow a quote from the UNIX-HATERS Handbook, &quot;I&#x27;m rather surprised that [Rasmus Lerdorf] is still walking around alive&quot;; indeed, long may he continue to do so, for if there&#x27;s a special hell for programmers, then in its frozen ninth circle there must surely be a waiting hole in the ice with his name carved around the edge -- or, just possibly, a throne.",1392649657

Consider the other side of the coin. Let&#x27;s say Facebook shows you products that you don&#x27;t already want, but based on your age, interests, and past behavior, you have a high likelihood of wanting. The barrage of ads you see convince you to buy that product. In this case, making the advertising more &quot;useful&quot; through better targeting doesn&#x27;t save you, the consumer, time and money. Just encourages you to buy something you we&#x27;re perfectly happy without. So is this the kind of advertising you&#x27;d like more of? The kind that sells more products for the company, but doesn&#x27;t help the consumer make the best purchasing decision?<p>Now I&#x27;m not opposed to advertising, and I think advertising can benefit companies and consumers. But we need to start a debate about the usefulness of advertising to separate good advertising from bad. Please pick apart my example above. I&#x27;m sure my argument has weaknesses, and I&#x27;d love to know what they are.",1392649619

Such a treaty would have effectively allowed citizens of the EU to live and work in Switzerland without having to obtain a visa or residence permit first (it would not have allow them to profit from social security or other benefits, though).<p>Since the referendum was accepted (though with a really thin majority of 50.3 %) it will force Switzerland to renegotiate the treaty with the EU, which in fact already suspended further negotiations with Switzerland by itself.<p>Immigration of qualified workers will still be possible and encouraged by Switzerland, though. I think the main motivation behind the referendum was the fear of &quot;Überfremdung&quot; (foreign infiltration), which is probably not entirely irrational with currently 25 % of people living in Switzerland being of foreign origin.

7252330,comment,7251113,7251729,3,0,trebor,,,"> Having to explicitly list a function&#x27;s free variables with &quot;use&quot; is a hideous consequence of not having lexical scope from the start, so again it&#x27;s understandable.<p>No, it&#x27;s a clear avoidance of the problems of the Javascript lexical scope. Yes, it&#x27;d be nice to have that &quot;for free&quot;, but there&#x27;s far worse that could happen if you had free access to all variables. The GC complexity alone would outweigh the benefit.<p>> Likewise, the parser doesn&#x27;t realise that functions may be stored in objects:<p>A contrived example actually. First, the interpreter only interprets &quot;$foo->quux()&quot; as a method call on a non-existent method. You are not accessing a property of the object, ever, through a method call like that. Instead, you have the option to implement __call.<p><pre><code>    class foo {\n        public $quux;\n        \n        public function __call($method, $args) {\n            if (property_exists($this, $method) && is_callable($this->$method)) {\n                return call_user_func_array($this->$method, $args);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    $foo = new foo;\n    $foo->quux = function () { echo &#x27;hello&#x27;; };\n    $foo->quux();\n</code></pre>\nChanging this behavior could single-handedly break compatibility with all libraries making use of __get/__call methods. It could have been implemented, yes, and probably should have been. However, most people using PHP aren&#x27;t throwing closures on an object (the closure won&#x27;t have access to $this scope till 5.4 or later, you know) and expecting them to work like a method.<p>I may address the other points later, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you&#x27;d take a look and try writing idiomatic PHP you&#x27;d find it easier than assuming that your idioms from other languages will work directly and without modification.",1392649366

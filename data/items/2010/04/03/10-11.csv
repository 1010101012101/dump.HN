I buy them frozen.<p>Defrost in 20 minutes by putting in a bag (or box) of tap water.<p>Put oven (or toaster-oven) on high heat so it'll be already hot when you need it. Put a bunch of butter on a porcelain/ceramic plate. Put in microwave for a minute to make it melt and cover the plate. Put the fish on the plate. Turn it over so it'll have butter all over it. Pour lemon juice on it. (Can use store-bought lemon juice from a bottle.) Put salt on it. Put it in the oven. Come back after 7-10 minutes. Ready to it.<p>Healthiness: Awesome. (You can use less butter.)<p>Price: Awesome. Where I live the whole deal is $4-$5.<p>Quickness: Mediocre. Total time is ~30 minutes, but most of it you can be away. No need to stir like in cooking. Also, no pots or pans to watch! You make it straight in the plate!<p>Tastiness: Awesome, assuming you love fish. (And I do, so that's good for me.)",1270290273

My experience after 6 years of tablets: they suck. The interface is terrible to use starting from XP-Tablet Edition, to Windows 7. It is just like a laptop, but too small, to complicated. The iPad will not have the same fault. But I believe, for Apples success the interface will matter much less than the kick-ass content 3rd party developers provide. If I could have all Iphone/Ipad programs on my windows tablet, I would not switch.",1270289851

Emacs even has modes for video <i>editing</i> and photo <i>editing</i>. And I've been told the Emacs browser is the most accessible browser for vision-impaired users.<p>> Why is this that so many are obsessed with what iPad does not do, instead of how well it does what it does? How difficult it is to grasp that: a) iPad is not intended to replace anything<p>The grandparent was commenting on an article that specifically claimed that the iPad was going to <i>replace</i> laptops. Hence it is only fair that (s)he would talk about what loss the switch from a laptop to iPad would mean.",1270289639

1238464,comment,1238327,1238327,0,0,ohashi,,,"Doesn't sound like you want to improve your website, just drive traffic.  Basically you've got 3 major ways to drive traffic:<p>search - paid or organic<p>links - from anywhere, anyone<p>type in - people going to your site directly, often connected to offline advertising<p>you're probably best of scaling one/both of the first two options.<p>organic seo rankings is going to take time, you should spend maybe couple hours a day building links to your site for keywords you think are most relevant.<p>paid search (sem) is another scalable and faster strategy. it's not 'hands off' and requires you to create (well ok, not requires, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND) some landing pages optimized to each keyword and drive traffic to them.  It's a math game, clicks * price per click < your margin * conversion rate.  YOU WILL LOSE MONEY.  You will also learn and improve if you do this properly and can find keywords where you can meet that basic criteria.<p>as far as getting links... there is the tried and true for SEO purposes: article marketing, directory marketing, social commenting.  But don't forget the real purpose of those links back in the day was to actually DRIVE traffic.  I saw some creative ways here about having myspace messages, same with twitter, facebook, etc.  The best advice I can give you here is MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO LINK YOU.  Create some compelling and interesting content.

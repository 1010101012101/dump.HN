1775693,comment,1775188,1775188,0,0,SabrinaDent,,,"Couple of points:<p>1. If by ""startup"" you mean tech startups as opposed to bricks and mortar businesses, there are fewer women programmers around to front tech startups. The law of averages is at work there, but I don't think it accounts for the whole disparity.<p>2. The VC model specific to tech startups is not what you'd call kid friendly. Please note that we are discussing this issue at Y Combinator. Submitting your startup to YC requires that you be willing to <i>move to the Valley</i> for three months. This is incredibly difficult if you have kids; if you are primary custodial parent, it is virtually impossible.<p>3. When women do run tech startups, they are not necessarily granted the credibility or profile. Penelope Trunk's article appears on Techcrunch. Ravelry has 850,000 members. It's been covered exactly once by TC, when it rolled into beta, with the line ""If you’re a knitter, join the waiting list immediately. Everyone else, nothing to see here.""

1775681,comment,1775188,1775272,0,0,mklg1266,,,"""Nowadays there aren't any barriers preventing women from taking these paths (quite the opposite, actually). It's simply that less women choose these routes.""<p>Begging the question.  As you point out, there are no laws or physical barriers preventing women in the US from doing just about anything, so their heavy relative underrepresentation means <i>by definition</i> they're choosing not to.  The question is: why not?  Choices aren't made in a vacuum.  What is it about our culture and society that has led to the percentage of women in tech/computing to drop pretty much consistently since the field was invented while their numbers increase in many other formerly all-male professions?<p>You posit that women are observed to be more risk-averse, and that this explains why they avoid founding startups.  Leaving aside whether this is true, I repeat my question:  why?<p>(Tangentially, as I think someone else pointed out, the ""women are biologically risk-averse"" trope can only explain why women ""choose"" to not found startups, not why they ""choose"" to not work as a dev at a big tech company, for example, where the risk level is close to nil.  Have you looked at the health benefits/maternity leave/termination policies at places like IBM or Microsoft?)<p>Everyone loves to triangulate complex evolutionary explanations to this kind of question, but a cultural argument is even simpler to make: women get paid less, are taken less seriously, are subject to glass ceilings, harassment, discrimination, have a higher probability of being raped, etc etc, <i>every single day</i>.  Moreover, women are explicitly told from an early age not to dress too provocatively, never leave a drink unattended, never ever ever walk home alone at night. . .and that's leaving aside the more subtle cultural pressures that discourage them from the sciences.   Women are at higher ""risk"" than men just by virtue of their gender, and they're reminded of this, with an implicit or explicit injunction to be careful, all the damned time.  That might serve as a reasonable explanation for why they'd be more risk-averse, but is unfortunate in that it can't be shrugged aside with a trite evolutionary explanation.<p>Just because there are no laws preventing women from doing something does not mean that the playing field is equal.",1286653861

1775665,comment,1775143,1775143,0,0,lzw,,,"Since this is a global warming related topic, we're seeing the very common global warming debate. I've a few points to make in defense of this ex-member of APS, and in response to the arguments that are so commonly presented for AGW.<p>Science does not operate by consensus.  The consensus of scientists for many decades was that the earth was flat.  as we well know, the earth is not flat. (But if you want to argue that the earth is, in fact flat, I'm willing to hear your arguments.  What's the worst that could happen? I could be amused.  But if I've been tricked by the Round Earth Scam then I'd want to know.  It is silly to say it is beyond discussion simply because most people believe the earth is round.)<p>When I worked for a national lab I would, for amusements sake, take the position that Einstein was wrong, and I would argue against general relativity. I did this with Professors, Post Docs, both theoretical and empirical and a variety of people much smarter and better informed than me.  This was educational and a good exercise.  While I may have irritated them on occasions, and while general relativity is about as close as you get to ""settled science"", never once was the argument given to me that this was a correct theory based on the ""consensus of scientists"".<p>If you're arguing for a scientific position and you're using ""preponderance of the evidence"" in lawyer speak to make your position, you're not actually taking the scientific position, you are taking an anti-science position.  The preponderance of the evidence will always fit a conventional view, and the advancement of science comes from finding something that does not fit the conventional view.  This is what careers are (or were, apparently) made on.<p>So, the argument that this is ""settled"" and therefore is not worth debating and that anyone who doesn't subscribe to this theory is irrational, is a very profoundly anti-science perspective. It is also the defacto position and has been since I first heard of global warming.  How can a scientific movement start out by presupposing its own conclusions as fact?<p>Further, if you do not wish to spend the time reading papers, or investigating the matter at a deep level, do not advocate for a position on the internet.  This kind of advocation is the worst combination of politics and science.  You're arguing for a scientific conclusion based on your political ideology, not based on science. (Which is why preponderance of evidence is convenient - it is an attempt to short circuit debate so you don't have to debate the scientific points.)<p>AGW is easily disproven with straightforward observations (not to mention a mountain of peer reviewed papers to the contrary, none of which can be effectively debated in this forum.)  The easy disproof of AGW is:<p>1. The earth is getting colder, not warmer, while CO2 levels continue to rise.<p>2. Historically the earth has mostly been much colder and if you want to find a warming trend you will find the one since the last ice age, which has happened after every ice age.<p>3. During the period where the planet was getting warmer in the recent past, coinciding with the solar cycle, mars got warmer as well, yet mars has no humans on it.<p>4. The climate gate emails reveal deliberate distortion of the numbers by adding a ""fudge factor"" which accounts for essentially all the warming shown in that ""baseline"" data.<p>5. The only papers showing warming on a global scale are showing the results of computer models that do not have predictive value if you apply past data, thus they are predicated on the assumption that some major change in the global climate has been reached, with no historical precedent.  EG: the models are not actually models.<p>6. The planet has experienced several periods that were much warmer and had much higher CO2.  While CO2 and warming are correlated, the CO2 levels tend to come after the warming, not before.  This whole thing could be called a correlation-causation error if it weren't being pushed so adamantly in the face of scientific disproof.<p>7. The AGW movement is a political movement, primarily centered around Al Gore and the IPCC Neither of which are scientific.  The IPCC rewrote the statements of the scientists who contributed to the report because it felt they were not declarative enough.  The motive here is pretty obvious, as if AGW were accepted, government would gain massive power to regulate the global economy and people everywhere, as has already been demonstrated by such travesties of economics and justice as ""Cap and Trade"".<p>8.  When Al Gore started to harp on this issue it was a legitimate concern as he portrays in his movie, after meeting a UCSD professor who told him the theory. A decade later, in the 1980s the UCSD professor discovered his theory was wrong, and being a man of integrity, published his findings. Al Gore, being a man of no integrity continues to pretend like he didn't.<p>9. The IR absorption of CO2 in the atmosphere is not a significant impact on the planet and not able to cause a ""Greenhouse"" effect.  CO2 in the atmosphere is a tiny fraction of a percent.  IT is vastly outweighed by water vapor which has much more significant IR absorption and thus is the source of essentially all possible greenhouse effect.  But Clouds are not something humans can control,and therefore, the AGW proponents focus on CO2.<p>10. AGW theory is based on the idea of some magical tipping point after which the effect will become run-away and beyond our control.  The fear being spread is argued on this basis.  However in the past, CO2 has been higher than it is today, and in fact has been dramatically higher than it is today, with no runaway effect.  (Further, the planet has been much warmer than it is today, warmer than even the worst case scenarios being projected, and still went into subsequent ice ages.)<p>11. Numerous, possibly, every place where we should see this warming showing up, we are not.  However, if you google for any of these you can find them used as evidence of warming, by either adding fudge factors or selectively citing data and ignoring the data that shows cooling.  This shows a consistent and persistent fraud being perpetrated arguing for AGW, at least in the blogosphere. (Not going to make the allegation against scientists, I believe they are being honest, but they are working with fabricated baseline data that was at the center of climate-gate.)<p>I'm not going to cite any papers here because scientific reality does not come nicely summed up in a single paper making a specific point. Many of my claims are easily verifiable. eg: ""As of April 2010, carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is at a concentration of 391 ppm by volume.""<p>You can quibble with my words in the above statements and it is quite possible I spoke over broadly once or twice.  But you can't change these basic facts about the situation.  I know there are blog posts from non-scientists who ""debunk"" probably every thing stated above.  If all you need to believe in something is for someone on the internet to have written a rationalization, no matter how ignorant or dishonest, then there is no convincing you against AGW.<p>But it really doesn't matter, even if you reject every one of my points.  Science is not about consensus.  Science is not about downvoting people who dare to point out facts not consistent with the popular theory.<p>Science is about applying the scientific method and following the data wherever it leads, not only if it follows a political agenda, or your source of fundings political agenda.<p>IF you downvote me, do so knowing that you cannot claim that I have not made an argument, have not contributed to this discussion, and have not presented evidence defending my position.  I have done all three. Realize you are downvoting me because you do not like the conclusion I reached.<p>Science should not be about removing funding from people who discover inconvenient truths that go agains the political winds.  Hacker news should not be about burying people who fail to march in lock step with popular opinion.",1286653471

They say they're ""terrified"", but when they're asked for the raw data and the source code to their models, they refuse to provide it, making it impossible to verify that their terror is justified.<p>What information they do reveal does not inspire confidence in their analysis: for example, read the latest IPCC report and see how many key causal factors have a ""low"" level of scientific understanding. (It's true that greenhouse gases are not in that category, but the fact that we understand them pretty well does not justify simply ignoring the other factors when we admittedly don't know enough to judge their impact.)<p>Also, the IPCC predictions for how much the climate should have warmed by now, given the actual increase in CO2 levels, have basically been falsified: CO2 has been increasing faster than all but their most pessimistic predictions, yet climate has been warming slower than their most optimistic predictions. So as far as deciding how to act, I don't trust the IPCC predictions, and since those are driving all the policy recommendations from those who are ""terrified"", I don't trust those recommendations either.<p>""critics should be proving that something else is causing the recent heat records.""<p>No, the burden of proof is on those who want to implement highly disruptive policies without adequate justification.",1286653364

1775655,comment,1775584,1775584,0,0,dandelany,,,"Very cool, but I sometimes worry that the illusion of safety is more dangerous than the original danger itself.<p>In Boulder, where I live, several crosswalks were identified as being particularly dangerous for pedestrians, and pedestrian crossing signs with big flashing lights were installed at these locations over the past 5 years. This spring, a report was released[1] that showed accidents at many of these crosswalks had actually <i>increased</i> since the lights were installed. ""Taken together, the data suggests that approximately eight additional crossing accidents per year occur at these locations,"" says the report.<p>There are lots of theories about why, but I think it boils down to one thing: when pedestrians can hit a button and light up these big signs which are supposed to make everyone stop, it makes them feel much safer, to the point that many people will hit the button and start walking almost immediately, without taking the time to make sure that all lanes of traffic are aware of their presence and stopping.<p>The prospect of automated cars scares me because, obviously, they cannot be perfect, and they will not be able to identify every dangerous driving scenario. Of course, there is a manual override, but I fear that the car being right 99% of the time will lead to such a complacency in ""drivers"" that, in the 1% of cases where the car is wrong and about to hit something, we will not be able to stop in time. The more accurate the car is, the more safe we feel, and the less likely we are to monitor it as closely and notice when it is wrong.<p>Anyway, I rather hope I'm wrong. I'd really like to drink my coffee and read during my commute as my car drives me to work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_14859190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_14859190</a>",1286653270

At the city gym I go to I also sometimes see shopping carts full of belongings parked outside while (presumably) the owners are inside showering and washing their clothing in the locker rooms.<p>In my (limited) experience, I found that those that live on the streets and the working poor are incredibly resilient and resourceful. Unfortunately, the ones that look a little rougher often appear to have some kind of mental problems that make helping them difficult.<p>NYC also has a cell phone give away program [0]. My impression is that these types of programs are used by those that are more resilient and self-reliant rather affecting their intended audience of the most vulnerable.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.freegovernmentcellphones.net/states/new-york-government-cell-phone-providers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freegovernmentcellphones.net/states/new-york-gove...</a>",1429016393

Since most married couples are heterosexual and Engineering is still dominated by men, so contact of any kind is more rare.<p>On the other hand, dancers and choreographers are very likely to be dancing or choreographing with someone other than their spouse, at a very close physical distance to very fit partners who are nearly always the opposite gender. Jealousy and infidelity probably both play a part there. Same goes for bartenders -- the chances somebody comes to my engineering firm looking for a hot date? Not much, but a bar?

When I came on board I found the dev team to be highly dysfunctional, and repeating a lot of mistakes I&#x27;d spent the past few years working through.  An example is: using Java Hibernat/JPA ORM to build intricate object hierarchies that resulted in massive amounts of data loaded at runtime, causing out of memory exceptions and constant gc pauses.  On a 32 bit jvm you only get something 1.5GB of usable heap (even if the jvm/os allow you allocate more), when a user logs on and 500MB of data is loaded, well, you can only accommade 3 concurrent users.<p>So I went in, tried to communicate this, and talked about at my previous job we had used views and stored procedures to <i>not</i> load the entire object graph when only a subset was needed.  Crickets. No one cared.<p>It was very disheartening. Really made me doubt myself, and my ability to communicate.",1429016180

The best analogy I can provide to my experience is its very much like being an ancient gladiator without the death and blood.  I fight the other departments for my faction because anyone who stops fighting and sabotage will be consumed cannibal style by the non-pacifists.  Normally this would result in a less screwed up firm wiping out the megacorp, but once the megacorp (and its friends) own the government and the financial system, that will be made impossible.  Its not bad.  Its not literal gladiatorial combat so its not physically risky or stressful, and the business model and job are extremely stable.  It superficially seems like it would be boring to never really do anything, yet, oddly enough, with a lack of micromanagement comes liberation, exciting new tools and techniques, thus better fighters who almost accidentally get to play with exciting new stuff.

Tablet?  What&#x27;s likely to break?  What main approaches are there?  E.g., horiz elements wrap to vertical, different display entirely, let the user zoom/scan around, etc..<p>i18n/l10n: when you add multi-language support, some text will suddenly be three times as long, or even need to be displayed right-to-left.  Numbers may align differently.  What will happen to your menus, dropdowns, titles, etc.?  Will they wrap in an ugly way, or be cut off?  It&#x27;s pretty common for things to just break, because the original site was built by someone who assumed &quot;Home&quot; would always be 4 chars.<p>And accessibility (already mentioned in another comment).  Going into depth may be overkill, but I&#x27;d strongly advise covering the choices that <i>ruin</i> accessibility entirely.

So, 350 years? As a wild-ass guess.<p>That same page points out that sails don&#x27;t work much inside of 0.25 AU, because the temperature can exceed the material properties of the sail. Though I think if the apogee is inside of 0.20 AU it&#x27;s good enough.<p>To make it worse, the solar wind fluctuates, so unless there&#x27;s active control on the rocket, its orbit will be unpredictable over the centuries.

9373645,comment,9368401,9372062,0,0,hydrogen18,,,"Yes, but unfortunately logic and reason don&#x27;t factor into the decision making around nuclear energy policy.<p>People love to point scream and shout about the dangers of nuclear energy. In conversation I&#x27;ve noticed that people think of nuclear energy as interchangeable with nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are incredibly difficult to build compared to a nuclear fission reactor. The experimental data you need to build one either requires numerous tests or stealing it from a government. Nuclear reactors on the other hand, can be very simple. The simplest reactors are just lumps of radioactive material carefully bonded to thermoelectric devices! The biggest risk from a conventional nuclear reactor is a steam explosion and the dispersal of radioactive material. I reckon the second biggest risk is having tons (quite literally) of spent fuel laying around the country for no good reason. The storage ponds aren&#x27;t 100%, accidents will happen. For most of the ponds if the cooling systems went offline the water would boil away and then the fuel would self-heat till it started to oxidize. At that point you&#x27;ve basically got hundreds of miniature fallout generators going. You better hope the structure above the pond is airtight because no one is going to be entering it again in this century.<p>The same group of people that scream and shout about nuclear energy being unsafe seem to actively ignore the dangers of conventional energy generation. For example, steam explosions are still a risk to the employees operating the plant. But I guess their lives don&#x27;t matter? The pollution from coal isn&#x27;t exactly helping the environment. Then there is this matter of what to do with all of the coal dust after it is burnt. You know, the same coal ash that over 1 billion gallons recently flooded an area of Tennessee. This contaminated a river, people&#x27;s land, and destroyed their homes.<p>Even if we ceased 100% of nuclear energy generation today, we still need Yucca Mountain to deal with the spent fuel we already have. It seems that some groups in the US believe that if they scream loudly enough, the problems of the world will simply go away.<p>Also there is this issue of the fact that the energy consumers and the taxpayers already paid for the fucking thing but aren&#x27;t getting any of the benefits.

9373525,comment,9372913,9372913,0,0,nkoren,,,"There&#x27;s a lot to like about this rocket:<p>1.) It&#x27;s good to see ULA stepping up to the plate and actually innovating. SpaceX will need some competition by then, to keep the industry healthy.<p>2.) The name, &quot;Vulcan&quot;, is pretty badass. Certainly far better than the other, embarrassingly jingoistic candidates they were considering.<p>3.) The inclusion of innovative NewSpace companies like Blue Origin and Xcor is pretty exciting, even if ULA hasn&#x27;t actually committed to using their technologies yet.<p>That said, there are ways in which the Vulcan seems like it was designed by a committee, and doesn&#x27;t quite seem fully-baked. In particular: the &quot;dial-a-rocket&quot; approach of strapping on solid boosters is at fundamental odds with the economics of reusability.<p>In an expendable rocket, solid boosters are used because you need a lot more thrust early in the ascent (to overcome gravity losses), and solid rockets are a relatively cheap way to achieve that. (Solids generate a lot of thrust during a short period of time, but their efficiency over long-duration burns is relatively poor, which is why they&#x27;re generally not used all the way to orbit). You could accomplish the same thing by using more liquid fuel and more engines in the primary booster stage -- but turbopump-driven liquid engines are a good deal more expensive than solid boosters, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to do this if you&#x27;re going to dump them in the ocean after a minute or two.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re recovering the engines, then using more of them is <i>absolutely</i> the right thing to do. In that case, the tradeoff isn&#x27;t between the cost of liquid engines vs. solid boosters; it&#x27;s the difference between the cost of <i>refurbishing</i> liquid engines (and some extra fuel) vs. solid boosters. In this case, the latter is likely to be more expensive by an order of magnitude. So if your hardware is reusable, then it&#x27;s better to have one or at most two vehicle configurations, and simply accept that most of the time your vehicle will be oversized for its payload. You also get some additional benefits from doing this, such as greater mass-produceability and engine-out capabilities, etc.<p>I suspect that the problem is that aerospace engineers are used to doing high-level trade studies using a crude $$$/kg costing for the cost of a rocket -- at least, this is how I&#x27;ve frequently seen them do it. If this is how you think, then you want your vehicle to be no larger than the payload requires -- and that&#x27;s what the dial-a-rocket approach allows you to do. But it&#x27;s kind of like assuming that a truck costs $$$/kg, and therefore if you need to carry a load across town, you should build a truck which is as large as you need and no larger. This makes sense if you take it as a given that you will always be building your trucks by hand, and that they will be thrown away after every journey. But if both of those assumptions are false, then so too is the &quot;build the truck to fit the payload&quot; design philosophy.<p>It doesn&#x27;t look like ULA has figured this out yet -- but they&#x27;ve definitely realised that there&#x27;s a fire under their tail, so hopefully they will do so eventually!",1429013111

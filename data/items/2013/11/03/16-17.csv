No.<p>Like all things it depends. If you are writing a library for others to use then you shouldn&#x27;t be extending globals for the reasons you have given. And if you do, you need a good reason and make it very clear to the user. If you are writing an application or a closed-source library, then it is usually safe to extend globals because you are in complete control. Like others have said in the String case, it makes its a lot easier to read the functions that do string manipulation.<p>The only absolute rule in software engineering is that there are no absolute rules.",1383497961

Assuming companies like EMC, IBM, and the hundreds of smaller companies with data analysis offerings can come up with increasingly efficient and offerings that increase revenue per user/data-point. The best that most user/data-centric start-ups can currently get (without loads of capital) is affiliate commissions or &quot;data-driven&quot; ads (from Google, et al). This is rapidly changing, and if it can keep pace with the demands, there&#x27;s no reason the current bubble can&#x27;t turn into a profit center.<p>Another thing worth noting is that, while user/data-centric start-up valuations are (very much) on the high end, other, unrelated software and hardware/IaaS companies are thriving in sectors that aim at replacing human workers in various fields (ecommerce, marketing, accounting, medical [you name it], etc.) with machines. This is intrinsically valuable and cannot be described as a bubble any more than replacing manual gas pumps/attendants with automatic ones can. It&#x27;s just the fruition of efficient ideas, coupled with readily available technology at prices that the SMB market can afford.<p>TL;DR<p>The bubble in user/data-centric start-up valuation doesn&#x27;t reflect the rest of the technology sector, and user/data-centric start-ups are quickly learning how to turn the aforementioned into a profit.",1383497361

I now use my 15&quot; Retina in scaled 1920x1200 equivalent most of the time when I&#x27;m doing programming work (when I&#x27;m not at my desk using a large external monitor), and it&#x27;s actually better than the 17&quot; in that mode -- due to the way they did scaling, fonts and widgets render with more detail.<p>That said, there are situations where the 15&quot; Retina 1920x1200 scaled is not as good as the 17&quot;: When I am sitting in bed (or maybe a couch), and the display is further away than it would be if I were sitting on a desk.  In that situation it&#x27;s not ideal, because the fonts become harder to see.  But there are two potential solutions to that: If the app I am using supports zooming, just zoom the content (e.g. web browsers all do this) OR switch to the best-for-retina 1440x900 equivalent.  I usually use best-for-retina when I&#x27;m not doing programming.  But, I still have my 17&quot; MBP, and it is my designated programming in bed laptop.<p>One of my favorite things about the Retina display is that I can <i>arbitrarily choose resolutions</i> without any perceived decrease in quality.  This is something we had with CRTs, and didn&#x27;t really have with LCDs until now.<p>Another potential downside: Apps that don&#x27;t support the retina display look pretty terrible.  They look best in scaled 1920x1200, but still not that great.  The only app I use that doesn&#x27;t support the retina display is Ableton Live (and it&#x27;s entire UI is vector-based and can scale via a zoom setting, so you think it wouldn&#x27;t be hard).",1383496868

This does indeed appear to make that one (common) case of passing the function arguments through unchanged marginally simpler. But it makes every other case worse. Compare, for example:<p><pre><code>    @decorator.decorator\n    def int_args(func, *args):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Coerces any function arguments to ints&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        return func(*map(int, args))\n</code></pre>\nto your:<p><pre><code>    @funcy.decorator\n    def int_args(call):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Coerces any function arguments to ints&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        return call._func(*map(int, call._args))\n</code></pre>\nIn the former case, everything is defined explicitly and it&#x27;s clear that the function only accepts positional arguments. In the latter case, you&#x27;re required to know the API of the library: that necessary objects are hidden behind the attributes call._func and call._args, and that the keyword arguments are silently discarded. It&#x27;s an extremely leaky abstraction.<p>You probably think that passing &#x27;self&#x27; to every method is boilerplate too, and arguably it is.

Then you can look at complication rates by surgical center -- very important. Finally, you can look at the size of the practice and how many patients they process per year. More is better.

Starting out - like anything - you need to do a lot of the legwork yourself but now I only spend a few hours a week managing my team and it provides a healthy full time income.  And with drop shipping, all the fulfillment, purchasing and warehousing is handled by someone else.<p>I know drop shipping can get a bad reputation, but when done correctly it can be an effective way to create a passive income streams.  If you can program well, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d recommend it over a SAAS based approach.  You&#x27;ll likely be able to make more money with SAAS as you&#x27;re creating your own products vs. selling an existing one.  But the long-term upkeep is generally less for eCommerce vs. SAAS (guessing here, as I&#x27;ve never run a SAAS business).<p>Margins are a bit lower with DS, so it does take a while to build some organic traffic and marketing buzz.  But once that starts to gain some traction, it&#x27;s not too much work to get a team in place and automate things.  And if you&#x27;re willing to put in the time to make a high-quality site that addresses customer questions and buying hesitations up-front before the sale, it&#x27;s even easier to automate on the back end for support.<p>But you do have to be careful about niche selection.  Because drop shipping markets are fairly competitive (low barriers to entry), you have to be really selective about what nniches you get into.  Specifically, I like to see really confusing niches where I can add lots of informational value, plus lots of accessories I can sell to increase overall margins).

In a busy airport like LAX, only 5 people total were shot. The gunman had a note that he specifically targeted the TSA. Out of the 5, 3 were TSA and 2 civilians. If LAX was busy, or not even, it would stand to reason there were <i>far more</i> \ncivilians he could&#x27;ve shot but didn&#x27;t. Why he even bothered with those 2 is anyone&#x27;s guess, at least according to the note he left.<p>The subject of the note can be read one of 2+ ways. Either he&#x27;s batshit insane and none of his reasoning is sound or he&#x27;s not quite insane and his reasoning pushed him to believe that killing people was for a beneficial good. People in general don&#x27;t really wake up wanting to murder, nor do they want to murder a very specific target. Whatever his justification to himself, it was enough to spur him into action. Premeditated by the supposed fact that the gun was bought legally.<p>The acts surrounding this incident do not mirror real terror like the recent rise in school shootings, yet the TSA is clearly looking to illicit the same level of sympathy. I call bullshit. Is it egregious that one person lost their life? Sure. Is this an act of terrorism? That&#x27;s an extremely hard sell in light of the note he wrote. If anything he wanted to terrorize the TSA only, because its hard to believe he didn&#x27;t have a &quot;target rich environment&quot; of civilians in a busy airport like LAX. One could reason that any shooting is an act of terror but that notion never seemed to exist before 9/11. People kill others with guns daily in this country, so what makes this any different?<p>Take this hypothetical: if the TSA didn&#x27;t exist, would this shooting have ever taken place? I say no. The TSA will never look at themselves as a source of FUD, propaganda, or terrorism but the reaction from this person shouldn&#x27;t be taken lightly, either. Yet it is. Instead of having clear reflection on how to mitigate this from happening again, they&#x27;re going in the direction of provoking it! What. The. Fuck. Are. These. People. Smoking?

You still have time to learn, start a first company that probably won&#x27;t take over the world, then try a second company.&quot;",1383494459

They&#x27;ll need to coordinate this with major Linux distributions, otherwise lots of people will be left in the cold.<p>As some of the commenters noted in the original thread, Ubuntu&#x27;s current LTS release runs PHP 5.3. The next LTS, which will include PHP 5.5, is not expected until April 2014. Since people are encouraged to wait until the .1 release before upgrading to the next LTS, it will probably take until the fall of 2014 for the majority of Ubuntu servers to get PHP 5.5.<p>Those who run Debian Stable will need to wait even longer, probably the middle of 2015, since Debian tends to take 2 years between major releases and the current Stable was released earlier this year.<p>Of course there are PPAs for Ubuntu and dotdeb for Debian, but people who run &quot;stable&quot; Linux distributions tend not to get third-party upgrades.<p>And let&#x27;s not even get started about CentOS...<p>Meanwhile, PHP 5.4 and above are a pain in the ass for shared hosting services, because some &quot;security features&quot; like safe_mode are gone forever and now the hosts need to rethink the security model on their multi-tenant servers. It took much longer for my favorite shared host, NearlyFreeSpeech, to roll out PHP 5.4 than it took them to roll out PHP 5.3. Getting PHP 5.3 is a big deal for us developers, but from the point of view of a web host it&#x27;s a relatively minor upgrade. PHP 5.4 and 5.5 are much more serious changes for web hosts.<p>A more realistic timeline would call for PHP 5.3 by the end of this year, followed by PHP 5.5 a year or two later, and after that all the major projects should vow to support only the 2-3 most recent minor releases. A gradual approach like this will get developers most of the features they really need, such as namespaces, late static binding, closures and Composer, as soon as possible (they&#x27;re all available in PHP 5.3). The new features of PHP 5.4 and 5.5 would be nice to have, but they can wait another year or two.<p>A rolling support schedule would also eliminate the need to do another GoPHPX.X campaign ever again. PHP 5.5 looks nice now, but you don&#x27;t want to be stuck with it 3 years later any more than you want to be stuck with IE 8. Once and for all, let&#x27;s force web hosts to do regular upgrades even if you don&#x27;t yell at them every single time.",1383494448

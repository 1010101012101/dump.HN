What they worry about and enjoy do nothing for me.  This started from a young age (what is allowance?  what is getting grounded?  hobbies?) and although I have many close white friends, on a whole they are the minority in my friend groups.  The only way this segregation has to do with race is that stereotypes are exactly that, true for a distribution.  Another way to say this is that people I end up relating well with tend to come from the same experiences (namely that of growing up Asian-American).<p>In addition, I&#x27;m often super surprised at these comments.  The US is many orders of magnitude less accepting of racism than Europe.  Europeans on the whole speak freely of their negative opinions of Muslims and gypsies.  In the US, any comment mentioning race carries immediately with it a negative connotation.  This is exactly why it is the breadstuff of comedians.  There is no humor in something that is simply accepted as &quot;truth&quot; as much of European racism is.<p>I hate speaking anecdotally, but just as a credit to my experience with racism in Europe as an Asian-American, my time there was filled with experiences ranging from ignorance to aggressive defensiveness.  Most of this can be explained away as just inexperience due to Europe&#x27;s immense racial homogeneity.  Often they would treat me as a fob which was an acceptable assumption.

Because of this, many landlords make the entirely rational business decision to do absolutely nothing to increase or maintain the value of their property. It&#x27;s not like they need to compete for tenants.<p>> The fact that the building stands ready, not decrepit enough to bring down the general attractiveness of the area, is partial credit to the landlord and her choice of tenant.<p>You don&#x27;t seem to understand two things:<p>1) The rental market in San Francisco. In the past five years, SF&#x27;s population has increased by ~50,000 people, but only ~7,500 new housing units have been built. [0]<p>2) The fact that <i>any</i> landlord can recover 100% of the damage done to their property from a tenant.<p>> Might the rent-control laws have had something to do with it too?<p>In San Francisco? No. New construction is <i>not</i> covered by rent stabilization regulation. [1] In regards to temporary demolition of rent controlled housing to make way for denser housing, the Trinity Place project has set a <i>really</i> good precedent. [2]<p>>  (After all, zoning laws aren&#x27;t easily effectively changed on an area that&#x27;s already filled in.)<p>The <i>major</i> zoning issue in SF that blocks new construction is building height limits. <i>So</i> much of SF is not permitted to have buildings higher than three or five stories. Note: This is not because of seismic concerns, this is because of &quot;neighborhood character&quot; concerns. [3] We&#x27;re not talking about constructing heavy industry in a residential zone. We&#x27;re talking about building taller residential buildings in a residential zone of a thoroughly urban environment.<p>[0] <a href=""http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2015/02/04/sfs_population_is_growing_way_faster_than_its_housing_stock.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2015/02/04/sfs_population_is_g...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10371695"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10371695</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10161813"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10161813</a> (See footnote zero attached to that comment.)<p>[3] Neighborhood character concerns are <i>very</i> valid.

Whether or not there is are innate differences in tendency, behavior is quite malleable via the proper culture, institutions, and law enforcement. But if you really want an answer I will try to humor you.<p>&quot;<i>I am asking a different question. To be blunt, which contributes more to the current lack of &quot;civilizing influences&quot; in inner-cities: that the actors involved are black, or that the actors involved were born into the same lack of &quot;civilizing influences&quot; 20 years earlier?</i>&quot;<p>To be even more blunt, I take it you asking whether black genes matter more or whether the environmental conditions matter more? It is not really possible to answer that question along a comparative axis of &quot;more or less.&quot; With most human traits, genes determine both the slope of the improvement curve and where the improvement curve plateaus. Environment determines where one is along that curve. I cannot throw a javelin 80 meters. Which matters more, genes or the fact that I have never trained to throw the javelin? That&#x27;s not really a well put question. I&#x27;m sure with training I could throw it 40 meters, I highly doubt I have the genes to ever be able to throw it a world-class 80 meters.<p>Similarly with African-American neighborhoods -- I think they have the genes to have peaceful, orderly neighborhoods because such neighborhoods have existed in the African-American population before. I am pessimistic that there will ever be an African or African-American Pudong or Silicon Valley, because I don&#x27;t think the concentration of genes are there. I would love to be proven wrong, but I think more evidence backs that view than not ( <a href=""https://jaymans.wordpress.com/jaymans-race-inheritance-and-iq-f-a-q-f-r-b/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jaymans.wordpress.com/jaymans-race-inheritance-and-i...</a> <a href=""https://liberalbiorealism.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/the-likelihood-of-genetic-group-differences-in-iq-the-black-white-gap-in-iq/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://liberalbiorealism.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/the-likel...</a> )<p>Most likely, there are statistical differences in gene frequency that make average behavioral traits differ between the races, all things being equal. I say that, because the world looks exactly like you would expect, were that hypothesis to be true. When you compare races, such as the Han Chinese, the Irish, and Africans, the Chinese tend to be the most orderly, regardless of where they live (China, Singapore, Taiwan, the American Chinatowns, etc) whereas those of African descent tend to have higher rates of crime and disorder, no matter whether it be Johannesburg, Belize, Rio, Liberia, Jamaica, Haiti, or Madison, Wisconsin. Worldwide, race predicts crime better than anything else.<p>But given the right conditions, Chinese can be quite disorderly. And we have proven cases in the past of black communities being quite disorderly. So regardless of the genetic tendencies, the outcomes are malleable.",1445901866

Such a class of investments certainly does exist: they&#x27;re called bad investments!<p>I think you&#x27;re missing the basis for the 2%-inflation-is-best theory.  Let&#x27;s start with this:  When is deflation bad?  Deflation is bad when it&#x27;s sustained enough that your salary goes down, <i>and you owe money</i>.  And if there are enough people in that circumstance, it&#x27;s bad for the economy as a whole, because a bunch of people default on their debts, which tends to cause a depression.  A mild deflation that doesn&#x27;t lead to lower wages, on the other hand, is probably good for the economy as a whole.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing:  When deflation is bad for the economy, it tends to be really bad.

And the only hint we get about this product specifically is:<p>&quot;Devices revenue decreased $1.8 billion or 49%, mainly due to lower revenue from phones, driven by the shift in strategy for the phone business, as well as lower Surface revenue. Phones revenue decreased $1.5 billion or 58%, as we sold 5.8 million Lumia phones and 25.5 million other non-Lumia phones in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, compared with 9.3 million and 42.9 million sold, respectively, in the prior year.

Buck thinks that it&#x27;ll only &quot;muss our hair a little bit&quot;, and argues against calling the Premier because that will end their chances for a preemptive attack.  Ripper said the same in his message to the War Room - that Communism can be wiped out with a pre-emptive strike and that we will prevail in our Purity of Essence.  He tells Mandrake that he has faith that the generals will do the rational thing and launch.<p>Both Buck and Ripper display paranoia of the &quot;Rooskies&quot;.  Buck opposes letting the Russian Ambassador into the War Room, continually agitates against any trust in the Russians, and goes so far as to plant a tiny camera on the Ambassador to try and get him ejected for &quot;taking pictures of the big board!&quot;.   Ripper, of course, has devolved into outright schizophrenia over the International Communist Conspiracy and the world at large.  The Redcoats are coming, Mandrake!<p>I realize those are very common themes that Cold War generals might exhibit.  However, they are fundamentally very similar characters who really only differ in their motivations by degree and sanity.  In a sense, Ripper asks us what would happen if Buck went off the deep end.<p>At that time, a head of the SAC (like Power) very much had the power to start World War III before anyone could even stop him, just as Ripper did.",1445900807

That&#x27;s all the law exempts from disclosure.<p>Nope.  The bill clearly defines &quot;cyber threat indicators&quot; to include the entire content of whatever these companies disclose to the government.  The things that make up &quot;cyber threat indicators&quot; go on for an entire page, and it&#x27;s an &quot;or&quot; list rather than an &quot;and&quot; list.  For Facebook, it would probably be something like a particular Facebook post that tripped their &quot;threat&quot; trigger, plus all the info that Facebook has about that user account (maybe every post that account ever made), including IP addresses that posted to that account and everything else.<p>And yes, every single thing &quot;shared&quot; with the government (I&#x27;m reminded of &quot;the sharing economy&quot; with this usage) is entirely exempt from FOIA disclosure, as the CISA bill clearly says.  And of course no cause of action shall lie in any court, so there&#x27;s no help there either.  So no, there will never be any way to review the scope or magnitude of this &quot;sharing&quot;, apart from whatever information (truthful or not) the government deigns to share.<p>Your description of CISA is the one that is straight up dishonest.",1445900804

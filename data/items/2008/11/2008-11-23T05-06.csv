373546,comment,373436,373436,0,0,evdawg,,,"WHY IS THIS ON THE FRONT PAGE?<p>reCAPTCHA has been around for ages. This isn't something new. Everyone knows about it. It's also widely implemented.<p>I would like to add however, I <i>hate</i> reCAPTCHA. If you are a web developer who has added reCaptcha to your site, remove it. If you are thinking about adding it in, <i>don't do it</i>! reCAPTCHA takes the annoying in a CAPTCHA and multiplies it by two. No longer are the days where you have to solve <i>one</i> illegible CAPTCHA, now you have to do <i>two</i>. Plus, one of them is so bad that OCR software couldn't recognize it.<p>It's not your or your users job to digitize books. You aren't doing the world some great justice or charity by implementing reCAPTCHA on your site. If you want to digitize books, go help develop better OCR software. If you want to stop spam, there are better, less invasive methods.",1227418739

It was first come first served for getting inside.  They didn't even give an indication of how overbooked it was... It ended up being a three-tier lottery.",1227418734

Kind of like the smelly cave woman in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who gives out a list of every choice she's made in life and tells Arthur that if he makes the opposite choices maybe he won't end up nearly as bad off as her.",1227417630

The second word is hard to break by hackers because it already failed a machine OCR algorithm (obviously that doesn't solve ""Turking"").<p>I also like that they have an audio CAPTCHA making their solution accessible by default. This is something a lot of home grown solutions lack. The Web should remain a place for everyone with or without a visual impairment.",1227417011

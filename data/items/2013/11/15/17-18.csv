But I think the ad that prompted the post by dhh is part of a trend in our society that is only going to get worse.  It&#x27;s ok for you and me who can find a job in a week, but that isn&#x27;t most people. Most people don&#x27;t have the option of telling their boss that it&#x27;s after hours.  They&#x27;ll lose their job, or significantly endanger their job/raise/bonus/performance eval/etc. if they do so.<p>There has been an amazing increase in productivity over the last 20+ years, but all it&#x27;s led to is companies making their employees do more.  The ads just reinforce that this is ok.  That you are at the mercy of your job 24/7/365. It&#x27;s a disturbing trend.",1384538395

Science begins with theory.

6740918,comment,6740775,6740775,2,0,salient,,,"I definitely blame Google most for not sticking with their original plan of stopping support for h.264 in Chrome 10. They could&#x27;ve done like Apple, when they decided not to support Flash, and Apple &quot;won&quot; - why? Because them dropping the support for a proprietary plugin was the <i>right thing to do</i>.<p>Google could&#x27;ve done the <i>right thing</i> and dropped the proprietary h.264, too, but they didn&#x27;t, and instead left Mozilla alone, as they &quot;watched and saw&quot; how things were going, instead of pushing VP8 as hard as possible to Android devices/chips, and making VP8 the default codec for Youtube, with fallback to Flash, for browsers who didn&#x27;t support it.<p>That being said, I think Mozilla adopting Cisco&#x27;s &quot;open source&quot; binary blob for h.264 turned a situation from bad to <i>worse</i>. Daala better be 2-3x more efficient at the same quality than HEVC/VP9, and arrive in 2015, otherwise the codec war is probably over (at least for the rest of this decade).",1384538355

6740902,comment,6740652,6740652,53,0,dopamean,,,"> The same beast bit us both, Hammond said. They went after Aaron because of his involvement in legitimate political causes  they railroaded charges against him, and look what happened.<p>First let me say that I am pretty sympathetic to Hammond and Swartz (though I think their actions were totally different).  I am sympathetic because I&#x27;ve been in Hammond&#x27;s shoes actually.  I had my door kicked in when I was 15 for things I shouldn&#x27;t have done online.<p>What Hammond has said here really bothers me for two reasons.  The first is that he attempt to conflate things that are not equal in any way.  Swartz may have had a &quot;legitimate political cause&quot; but he sullied it (in my opinion) with illegal activities.  Anonymous may also have a legitimate gripe but their actions were illegal and Hammond is now paying the price.  That&#x27;s how it works.  It is wrong to act as if you somehow should be looked at differently by the law because you had a &quot;legitimate political cause.&quot;<p>Also, it&#x27;s really not fair at all for Hammond to compare his situation to Swartz.  The damage done by what Swartz did is nothing compared to damage and potential for real harm with what Hammond did.  Maybe I&#x27;m alone in this but I think that is an asinine comparison that does Swartz&#x27;s reputation a disservice.",1384538210

Therefore, it&#x27;s absurd to extrapolate that our economy will grow at the same pace forever. That is, technology can&#x27;t fix everything.<p>I would agree that outright genocide is a bad idea.

This means much of the catalog is there, but less useful for you (unless, of course, you&#x27;re into German polkas or Swedish midsummer dances). XBox and Spotify do tally all of these up to arrive at their totals.<p>#2 - The full catalog in international services isn&#x27;t usually available to you<p>At least on Spotify, you <i>cannot</i> access all of the items in the catalog of another country (e.g. with a US account, you cannot access all of the Dutch catalog, I tried).

And that&#x27;s why DHH argument comes across as so silly, because it is dystopian not to allow technology that allows me to time shift my work.<p>By DHH&#x27;s same metric, the following are dystopian because they enable you to work outside your office: Remote desktop, VPN, Google Apps, SaaS offerings, web based tools, smartphones with work email.<p>Google even has a similar pitch for their Google apps:<p>>Need to attend a meeting from your kids soccer game?<p>>Access your work from any device with a web browser  your computer, phone or tablet  and stay productive even when youre away from the office<p>>Google Apps makes it easy to stay connected to projects youre working on and the people you work with, no matter where you are or what device youre using.",1384535297

6740516,comment,6729941,6729941,1,0,T-hawk,,,"You&#x27;re asking the question the wrong way around.  Text doesn&#x27;t get converted to 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s or turned into voltages.  The 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s and voltages are the first principles.  Code is emergent behavior.<p>When you strike a key on your keyboard, what happens?  A few circuit lines on the keyboard switch matrix that are normally open become closed circuits.  These circuits are inputs to a keyboard decoder chip such as a 74C922.  It interprets voltage levels on these lines as 1&#x27;s or 0&#x27;s and produces what we call a scan code.  This scan code is output serially to the PC over the keyboard connection by sending voltage levels that switch between 1 and 0 over time.<p>The PC contains a chip (a collection of transistors wired together) that we call a keyboard controller.  It sequentially switches a number of transistors to read the incoming scan code bit by bit and store each bit in a flip-flop.  We call this collection of flip-flops a register.  The keyboard controller also drives voltages representing 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s onto some circuit lines that are wired into the CPU.  We call this an interrupt.  More transistors within the CPU will detect that interrupt signal and copy a pattern of 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s into a particular collection of flip-flops, which we call the program counter register.  We now have the concept of an interrupt handler.<p>The CPU&#x27;s transistors now drive the 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s in the program counter register (flip-flops) onto a group of circuit lines.  We call that collection the memory address bus, and the pattern an address.  The memory is itself a giant collection of flip-flops, a few (8 or 32 or whatever) of which are wired to respond to this pattern on the address bus and drive their contents onto another group of circuit lines that we call the data bus.  These contents we call an opcode, and the pattern of this opcode we might call a port-read instruction.  Inside the CPU, a particular group of transistors activates to execute this opcode, with the result of copying the contents of a particular port (the flip-flops in the keyboard controller) into a register within the CPU (more flip-flops.)  Then the next opcode activates another group of transistors to copy the register flip-flops onto the memory bus, where the 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s latch into some more memory flip-flops.  (There&#x27;s more to interrupt handling than this of course, but that&#x27;s the bare essentials.)<p>Do that many times and you might eventually have a sequence of memory flip-flops with a pattern of 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s representing a string such as PRINT &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;.  But it&#x27;s not that this text was converted into 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s.  The 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s are the first principles.  It&#x27;s flip-flops and electric signals all the way down.<p>&quot;Text&quot; or &quot;code&quot; or &quot;software&quot; are merely abstractions we use to describe emergent behavior arising from groups of transistors shuffling around these 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s.",1384534880

Chances are you aren&#x27;t transmitting power from this gizmo to your house at USB voltage (horribly inefficient) so it&#x27;s probably being sent at a higher voltage (110V seems the obvious option) which means converting it back down using an power brick, so the Wh capacity of the battery understates the power requirement for running the iPad by the inefficiency of the power brick.",1384534877

Yes, having to work during your kid&#x27;s soccer game is not great, but having the option makes some things possible.<p>Clearly there are toxic work situations where &quot;the boss&quot; is always demanding more than is possible and requiring a lot of free &quot;overtime&quot; to get it done.

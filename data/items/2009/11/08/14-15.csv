I tried out the 'don't say the words in the mind while you read' tactic to try speedreading, but felt very artificial (as in concentrating more on saying blah blah in the mind while skimming the text)<p>Could you share your stories/tips about how soon do you finish a fiction/non-fiction book (non-tech). If you do speedread a fiction - can you recall it after a few days?<p>You Sir! - the voracious reader, I am asking you!<p>Mileage may vary for everyone, but any tips you picked up over the years?<p>I have of some who read a book every other day - I  am not one of them. Sometimes a book takes a week and another one takes couple of months...There's so much to read and so little time.<p>Any stories/tips?<p>EDIT:<p>(thanks to @tokenadult) Speedreading has been discussed earlier (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=419795). That was enough to understand speedreading.<p>I am interested in tips/learning experiences from your reading/your reading style.",1257692385
929321,comment,929168,929168,0,0,MicahWedemeyer,,,"Overall, I like the message, and I'm a big fan of people recounting their experiences to give everyone else a glimpse into the process.  However, I do take issue with the following points of advice:<p># Read as many essays as you can that PG has written.  Watch any videos you can find as well.  Get a sense of his style.<p># Research previous YC companies.  Take a look at the types of companies YC has funded and see where you could fit in.<p>I think it comes down to answering this question: <i>Do I want to do my startup, or do I want to be a YC company?</i>  If it's the former, then don't spend time trying to study and cram on your YC/PG knowledge, unless that info will be useful to your company.  It's not a trivia game, after all.<p>If the answer is the latter, then by all means read up and prepare for the application/interview process, as you'll need every shred of advantage you can get. Everything is riding on the application and interview. It's a risky bet, but at most you'll lose a couple weeks effort if you don't get accepted, and you can re-apply in a couple months time.<p>I suppose it doesn't hurt to do your research, but I think YC applicants who see YC as an avenue to do their startup, rather than the reverse, are better off just working on their idea and trying to get closer to a release.<p>Anyways, good luck with everything and thanks again for sharing your experiences.<p>(Note: I'm not singling listia out here, as I have no idea what their answer to the question would be.  I'm just suggesting that all YC applicants ask themselves that question, be honest about the answer, and use that knowledge to help decide how much effort will be spent on the YC application.)",1257692336

I only noticed a tendency of any comment critical of Microsoft having a more than average likelihood of being downvoted, something I already noticed years ago, when Digg was intersting. This topic seems to bring out a certain amount of passion in the audience, myself included.<p>There are two statements you can try to falsify: ""It is possible for you to hire people to secure an open platform from the ground up"" and ""It is up to Microsoft to secure Windows from top to wherever they think the cost exceeds the benefit for them"". As for the third, ""Microsoft <i>seems</i> to spend more money promoting their wares than <i>properly</i> checking and securing them"", it's an impression and, as such, subjective. The ""seems"" is there because they do spend a whole lot of money in promoting their software and the ""properly"" is there because it doesn't matter how much they spend, the results are still pitiful, as the mountain of spam in my inbox and the constant onslaught of botnets on my clients (no - my trade is software, but my code has passed more security audits than I can remember) demonstrate so eloquently.

There's nothing in the Constitution that can be remotely construed to allow the government forcing people to purchase things.<p>Now at the state level it's a different matter entirely. Congress could have easily come up with some kind of reward-punishment system that required states to find some solution. And then you'd have 50 states each trying different ideas. They could harvest the best from each other. But it does not appear (to me) that the goal here is iterative, incremental solutions to a pressing problem.

I also have no reason to believe that most ""professionals"" are that well versed in it.  Email lists have been a source of personal stories about bright kids.  Kids that are 2e may only be recognized by the school system as having handicaps and learning disabilities and never get recognized as also being very intelligent.  The anecdotal evidence indicates that the brightest kids are often a poor fit for the public school system and are often not recognized as ""the best and brightest"" while in school.

If these jobs are eliminated, that's a wonderful thing! It increases the average work that the average worker is doing. This increases their average salary. This is not a problem!<p>The only real problem is getting these temporarily unemployed people an education and a new job. That's not a very big problem, as markets tend to make work when work is available. For instance, where did all the factory workers come from at the start of the industrial revolution? Everyone was working before then, presumably, as there was no such thing as welfare from the government. The workers came from industries that were torn down by the industrial revolution. We don't have cotton pickers anymore. We don't plow by hand. We don't have many of the menial labour jobs we had a hundred years ago, yet unemployment is less than 10% in Canada. The market equalized itself.<p>Where can these cashiers go? Perhaps preparing food. I wonder if we could start seeing more healthy restaurants that are more closely approaching the true cost of food at a grocery store. Since it costs less to have the store open, since the cash is automated, one could easily see that there would be more money available for food preparation.<p>The market <i>will</i> find a place for these workers, and everyone on average <i>will</i> see a net benefit from getting rid of non-producing jobs.",1257691554

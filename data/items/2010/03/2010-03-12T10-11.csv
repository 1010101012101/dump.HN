Whenever there is progress the majority of people stop doing the 'old' thing in favour of the 'new' thing. Hardly anyone in the first world makes their own clothes these days as our standard of living/price of clothing makes it easy not to, most young people wouldn't even consider making their own furniture, people don't hand-write letters. I'm not saying that these things are necessarily bad, just using them as examples of things 'nobody would prevent anyone from [doing]' which people don't (generally) do.<p>My team at work tends to go out and get our lunch together then sit in the kitchen and eat together. We probably talk more in that half an hour than we do the entire rest of the day. If we all took our magic food pill in the morning then that just wouldn't happen. No one would be stopping us doing it but we still wouldn't do it; it'd be far too easy to tell yourself that you're too busy to take that half hour break.",1268391148

Often the place they're not looking is a place of moral blindness.  Plenty of us would pay just about anything to look normal.  The moral blindness part is the people being sanctimonious about fat being a sign of weak willpower and having no concept of the actual science involved.<p>Another place to look would be fast, accurate molecule recognition array tests for venereal diseases.  Get it down to something the size of a vending machine, $20, and thirty minutes (results sent via text message) and you'll get people paying you every night.  Again, moral blindness may be a reason why people aren't looking as hard in this direction as they should to create lots of hedons - sex is sinful.<p>Speaking of not looking where everyone else is looking, would it be too crazy to ask people to do something that actually creates large amounts of value instead of throwing sheep?

The master record is cut in a relatively soft material. Copper, I think. The force of cutting removes material from the groove but also compresses the remaining material somewhat. This distortion may spill over into the neighbor groove just cut one turn earlier. The neighbor groove is silent between tracks.

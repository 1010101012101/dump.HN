That much is fine.<p>Still, hotwallets combined with limited human resources (can't have someone constantly checking the balance, cannot automate the loading of the wallet and keep that in the server for obvious reasons) usually end up in cutting corners, getting robbed and essentially financing crooks.<p>Cannot go around saying safe, home-made BTC wallet support is trivial for a newbie.

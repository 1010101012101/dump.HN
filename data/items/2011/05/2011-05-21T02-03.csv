2570142,comment,2570007,2570108,4,0,birken,,,"We actually had a debate in our engineering dept about how we wanted to handle functions like this, and in the end decided on tt_function_name() in the global function space.<p>We decided against putting them in explicit namespaces, because we felt these were convenience functions and they should be convenient to use.  We felt the convenience of:<p>if (tt_str_startswith($url, '<a href=""https://)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://)</a>) {
}<p>over something like:<p>if (tt/global/string/starts_with($url, '<a href=""https://)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://)</a>) {
}<p>was worth the lack of organization.  We have <10 of these types of global functions in our code base and we are very careful about adding new ones.  All other classes and functions are either in a namespace or class context.<p>We went with the tt_ prefix because we wanted to cover our bases and really explicitly ensure we never will collide with a PHP function, and we felt it isn't too unwieldy.<p>As for using a singleton class, since 5.3 we prefer to use namespaces instead.",1305946684

I spent a bunch of time having fairly in depth conversations with potential cofounders.  Really sharp people, many of which who had solid, well validated business ideas with significant investor interest.<p>But I couldn't fully commit.  In the end, I realized it was because deep in my heart, I wanted to have a great life now, not at some unspecified (and uncertain) point way in the future.  So I decided to focus on building a business that generates solid cash flow and which doesn't require a 60 hour workweek for me to maintain, once I get it up and running.<p>The process of going around and explaining my decision to everyone who I had been talking with awkward.  If you liken the process of finding a cofounder to dating leading up to marriage, then the process of ""breaking up"" was akin to going around to all of the girls you're dating and telling them you're gay.  ""We're both attracted to different things"", and, ""I respect your lifestyle choice"" were common phrases:)  People were supportive in a ""That's nice for you, I'm glad you're following your heart, but I would never choose that"" sort of way.<p>It's a shame that the valley culture is so focused on big, home run hit businesses.  We're now in an era of entrepreneurship where very solid cashflow businesses can be created with very little capital, and significantly lower risk than a big homerun hit business.  Yet, as a community, we treat them like the uncle whose lifestyle everyone accepts but no one wants to talk about.  A lot of the advising, incubators, and accepted best practices all center around taking funding and growing as big as possible as quickly as possible, above all else.<p>If any ""lifestyle"" entrepreneurs want to grab a cup of coffee sometime and swap advice and/or encouragement, drop me a line - my contact info is in my profile.",1305944815

In any professional career (Law, Medicine, Accounting, Engineering, Etc.) the field is constantly evolving and changing. To stay current you have to go to conferences, read papers, experiment. You need a 'learning lifestyle' which, for folks who are passionate about what they do, is natural. An Electrical Engineer who stopped learning after they left school in 1990 is not a desirable hire, just like a lawyer who hasn't bothered to keep abreast of the changes in the law for 20 years.<p>What I'm saying is that if you're a professional and you're not keeping current, then your lack of currency, more than your age, will hinder your employment.<p>That being said, there are age biases out there. Young managers can be intimidated by hiring an older person, especially if they are insecure.

As a programmer, I can also see areas that programming (or at least skilled computer usage, as some of these things can probably be done in Excel or existing tools) could add to most professions.<p>But even in your replies, you're often dealing with only small subsets. I don't want to live in a society which feels painters and sculptors are obsolete because we have webgl. I certainly don't want to live in a society in which the Oreo is an example of good baking. And the existence of webgl and Oreos doesn't indicate to me that painters, sculptors, and traditional bakers need to know about the programmatic options.<p>When not subsets, it's not clear to me why the professional ought to know programming rather than enlisting the help of a programmer. Programming tools for fire prediction would probably be quite involved. I've been programming professionally for 3 years, and I'm not sure I'd be up to the challenge. I'm not sure someone could be a skilled firefighter, learn programming well enough to write fire prediction tools, and still have a social life. And even if someone can, there's no reason <i>every</i> firefighter needs to. Once it's written, it's written, and others just need to learn to use it.<p>(As for the burger, I wouldn't eat it.

But universal suffrage for women came significantly earlier in the United States than it did in Switzerland, for example, and black people in my state (Minnesota) have always been able to vote and to own property and to marry whomever of whatever race and so on since before Minnesota became a state (which, indeed, was one of the points of the Dred Scott case, in which a slave tried to become free by claiming that his passage through the free territory of Minnesota should end his condition of slavery). The Civil War was a necessary reaction to totalitarian denial of basic human rights by the Confederate states, and the civil rights movement after World War II was a necessary response to the deplorable segregation that still occurred in those states long after the Civil War, but everyone in some regions of the United States has long recognized that slavery and Jim Crow segregation were both aberrations, gone in some states from the beginning, and always contrary to the basic principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights (and the bills of rights in various state constitutions).",1327942032

3529377,comment,3529045,3529045,28,0,robmay,,,"I have a lot of experience here because\na) in 2005 I started something called ""The Business Experiment"" which was an attempt to have a purely crowd sourced business. (<a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/101/next-essay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/101/next-essay.html</a>)  At the time, I spent a lot of my own money on lawyers trying to figure out how to give equity to people who aren't accredited investors.<p>b)I have since raised $10.5M in venture capital for Backupify.com, so I have also learned that side of the world.<p>From my view, allowing anybody to invest a few hundred or a few thousand dollars in a startup is a bad idea for a few reasons.  First of all, the startup world is glamorized by the media.  Most startups fail.  Most capital is erased.  No one writes about those companies, unless the failure is spectacular.  Studies have shown that on average, entrepreneurs will do better financially in the ""real world"" of work than in startups.  But the media doesn't play this up, and as a result, society has a bias that is a combination of the survivorship bias and recency bias that makes them think startups are a good investment.  Many wealthy people that I have dealt with don't really understand the odds and risks of startups, so all the less likely that your average Joe can do it.<p>Secondly, capital structure matters a lot as your company grows.  If you are successful, a bad capital structure can really fuck you over down the road when you need bigger rounds.  And some issues require a shareholder vote.  Average Joe doesn't know how to deal with these issues, and that scares professional investors.  An idea like this will get a lot of companies seed capital, and they won't be able to raise later stage.<p>Third point - startups are really fucking hard, and will strain all of your relationships in your life, including those with your investors.  Hell, Backupify is doing pretty well and it's still hard.  Having to manage a bunch of small investors can be a nightmare, and going through difficult times with people you barely know, who don't do this professionally, will just make it worse.<p>Here is my prediction about how this legislation plays out.\n1.  It will eventually pass, because it is sexy and cool and part of the American dream.<p>2.  Media will point to examples of companies getting funded that wouldn't normally get VC/Angel funding, to show how great it is.  These examples will be thinks like companies outside of major startup hubs, companies that don't put profit/shareholder value / growth first, companies that are highly unusual, weird, or even too risky for VC, and companies that have non-sexy ideas that can't get VC because they aren't mobile/social/sharing/whatever.<p>3.  Many will fail, but there will be at least one massive success, and that success will become the poster child for why this works.<p>4.  But really, it won't work.  People will lose money.  There will be lawsuits and complaints.  There will be a bubble after point #3 happens, and some 60ish dude will invest too much of his retirement in a dozen startups only to see every one of them fail and his whole net worth wiped out.<p>5.  There will be outcry against this, and we will pass laws to regulate it, taking us back to where we began, only in a much worse situation.<p>Now, all that said, I will say there is probably room for a new investment scenario under two conditions.<p>1.  The amount is so low it doesn't matter.  For example, the bar is $100 and you can't invest in more than 5 at any one time.  This makes your returns so small, even with homeruns, to be almost irrelevant, but maybe it's fun and cool and people will like it.<p>2.  There is probably room for an ""almost accredited investor"" clause.  I'm a perfect example for this.  I'm not quite accredited, but probably will be by this time next year.  I understand startups quite well.  So maybe a clause saying that if you have worked 2 years in a venture backed startup, you can invest up to $10K, that might be ok.<p>Anyway, those are my thoughts.  It will be interesting to see how this will play out.",1327941092

Programming (really, the whole pipeline of formal modeling, followed by algorithm and system devlepment) can get immensely difficult, and attracts some of the brightest minds on some of the most difficult problems that can be conceived. I couldn't let that statement go unchallenged.<p>If you have said something like ""developing CRUD web apps is so easy compared to some other jobs"", I would have had nothing to say to you, because you're probably right.<p>Maybe if you had gone to work at IBM on Watson, or for a NASA research center on spaceflight communication networks, or work for something like Certicom producing the next public key cryptosystem over elliptic curves, you'd really be flexing your math muscle <i>and</i> programming. I can imaging there are a small subset of startups as well that would extremely value your math capabilities. So you feel your degree was wasted modulo the way your career panned out.<p>And a final note about code being crap: Many dental and medical tourists come back to the US with extremely poor workmanship on their knee replacements, fillings, or root canals, and have to have much of it re-done here. Also, due to the nature of medicine and software development, the comparison isn't really apples-to-apples. An oral surgeon might do 10 wisdom-tooth removals a week, granted everyone's mouth is different and there are a huge number of complications, but many software developers are working on something entirely novel on each project.

Chef: must be able to work the mixomatic programmable mixer. Electrician: must have knowledge of microcontrollers. Fashion designer: must be able to create digital mock-ups of new designs and work out how to automatically share them with our manufacturers. Pilots: must be able to work and program so many systems it would make your head spin. Musicians: must have knowledge of MIDI and be able to use a sequencer. Firefighters: must be able to program the engine and help with the local 911 modernization. Psychiatrist: must participate in the machine learning diagnostic project the hospital is undergoing. Must be able to work with data mining to determine non-current patients in need of intervention. And so on.<p>These criteria are just made-up examples, but I could go on. We could easily pull down real ads. Let's try the most fuzzy one you have up there: artist. Know a writer who doesn't use a word-processor? They exist, sure, but not as many as before. In fact, most of them are now learning html and mixed media formats in order to eliminate publishers and broaden their base. It used to be the ""traditional"" writers didn't use software. Now they use software but don't configure and program it. The ""new generation"" of writers do that. What was optional is now becoming a necessity. What was ""computer literate"" is now looking more and more like programming. This trend will continue.<p>Perhaps there is some exception. If so, I haven't thought of it. And you haven't listed it here. Yes, in some abstract, perfect way plumbing has nothing to do with computers. But that's the hell of the thing: the plumber in our imagination isn't the one in the real world. In the real world being a plumber means managing your scheduling system, your A/R, working with CAD drawings for a new construction site, buying mechanical devices that require configuration and programming, looking more into robotics for some types of work, and so it goes. The mental picture we have of these jobs and the actual way they are evolving are two different things entirely. You might be able to argue that one or the other jobs has <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> computers and programming in it, but that's a moot point. You're fighting a losing battle. They had zero ten years ago, they have some now, and they'll be mostly automated in just a decade or two.

Machine learning from tweets about a celebrity to figure out their best look? To figure out trends in style in advance so the celebrity client always looks like they're ahead of the curve? Hell, apply this to fashion designers as well.<p>Winemakers - it's a science. A lot more goes into a bottle of wine than most of us think (I've seen how advanced the field of tea tasting is). I'm sure there's a lot of chances for programming therein.<p>Zookeepers - when do you put a mommy bear and a daddy bear together in the pen so they don't eat each other and produce baby bears instead? ok that's statistics, but a little R programming wouldn't hurt.<p>Guess what I'm saying is, almost all of these professions could benefit from <i>at least</i> programming in R.<p>edit: The point is that, if all those people at least <i>knew about</i> programming, who knows what they'd be able to create or at least think of (and then get someone to do it)?",1327939449

Why would Carpathia and Cogent not be subject to the same process of seizing the storage as evidence?<p>It very much looks like the seizure process is being used as a directed punitive measure and not merely as an evidence gathering process. We need better laws in the US to protect against seizure being used as non-judiciary, extra-legal punishment.",1327939402

I have nothing against cs and write most of my clientside app code in cs, but I think libraries should avoid using it. Simply because it makes debugging more complicated. It adds in an extra step or 2 every time you see a js error, you need to read the compiled code and then figure out where that is actually coming from, from an unknown codebase (your framework/lib).",1327939372

The body is full of spaghetti code, duplicate functionality, dead code that still causes bugs, and systems that evolved from a completely different purpose and didn't get the full rewrite they needed.</i><p>You know, I hear tech people saying stuff like this all the time but the question I would ask is: designed badly compared to what?  I mean, if you're comparing to software code made by humans (is there any other kind?) then I think biological systems work pretty damn well.  The type of systems that humans write code for are utterly trivial compared to what biology has to deal with -- and we STILL have all the anti-patterns and problems you mentioned with respect to biology.  Until human beings can write code of comparable complexity to life that lasts millions of years (forget about billions) I think you should show the woman some respect. :-)",1327939302

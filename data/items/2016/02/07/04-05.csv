The very nature of their own efforts is, itself, something-ism. As you illustrate, they&#x27;re categorizing a whole group, and assuming that every member of it fits its stereotypical mold.<p>So in one respect, sure, as a white male I had some advantages, but there are plenty of other ways to look at it. As a &quot;nerd&quot; I was bullied; I suffer from an incurable disease; I&#x27;m not a particularly attractive person; I&#x27;m notably uncoordinated and bad at sports. And on the other hand, I&#x27;ve got a fairly sharp mind, and have some talents and a supportive network around me. A lot of these things apply to other people in and out of my demographic cohort, to such a degree of ... let&#x27;s say &quot;diversity&quot; ... that it makes no sense to focus on those demographics when thinking about who has privileges or disadvantages.",1454821198
11051693,comment,11047865,11047865,0,0,jeevand,,,"H1B system is broken. It is especially hard if you are from India or China. Although you can change employers, you need to restart the green card process from scratch which introduces lots of uncertainties. Obama wanted to allow H1Bs to change employers easily by giving them better portability but USCIS came up with a bad rule which i believe is due to lobbying by employers. Australia & Canada have better immigration systems where they give PR quickly.<p>It is bad for US as well. Immigrants are generally more risk taking than citizens & H1B does not allow them to take risks when they are young because they will be waiting in the line for PR (Green Card). By the time they get green card it will be decade or more and their risk appetite would have reduced due to having family/children.<p>In general, I don&#x27;t believe most of the high salaries in tech may not be sustainable. Lots of tech jobs will move to India & China (or any low cost country in future which has a good pool of educated people), that is just capital chasing good enough talent which is cheap. Moving up the value chain is the only option.",1454821168

Not only that but it also suffers from the no true Scotsman fallacy.<p>The best way to promote meritocracy is to base your decisions on merit and nothing else. To avoid unconscious bias, you would have to hire someone without knowing their age, sex, sexual orientation or anything else that you could consider discriminatory. That would mean hiring someone that you haven&#x27;t and that&#x27;s a little extreme.",1454820923

The attached articles don&#x27;t really go into it. But the Wikipedia article includes this curious point, which I had never encountered before:<p><i>The eruption was documented by contemporary historians and is generally accepted as having started on 24 August 79, relying on one version of the text of Pliny&#x27;s letter. However the archeological excavations of Pompeii suggest that the city was buried about three months later. This is supported by another version of the letter, which gives the date of the eruption as November 23.</i><p>Which makes me want to imagine historians 2000 years from now debating whether 9/11 really occurred on 9/11 or closer to 12/11.<p>Which almost makes me want to go ask on /r/AskHistorians whether there is any record of Pompeii Truthers.

11051681,comment,11048409,11048409,0,0,err4nt,,,"I graduated graphic design in 2009, I worked from 2009-2011 building Joomla and WordPress websites for companies, then went freelance and I’ve been doing responsive front-end web stuff for about five years now. Here’s how I got from where you’re at to where I am now.<p>The web is built using three technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Literally every other technology that gets used with the web has to interface to one or more of these three, so focus your learning on the foundational technologies. If you try to learn React and Bootstrap and Flux and Grunt and Parse and Node and SASS and everything else you’ll get worn out just trying to get started. By learning the foundational technologies you can quickly adopt any tool you truly need to use, but you could never keep up with all the tools available out there.<p>Here are some simple rules and attitude changes I adopted in my own discipline that resulted in rapid learning in CSS, then HTML, then JavaScript:<p>- when building new projects, don’t automatically include bootstrap, or other libraries. Only include what you need AS you need it<p>- don’t look at other people’s code before trying to write your own solution first, this helps you clarify your needs!<p>- when you do look at other people’s code, NEVER copy/paste it, read and earn and rewrite what you need<p>- only ever copy/paste code you have personally written in the past<p>- don’t be afraid to rewrite code at any time<p>- code is expendable, and the more code you write the better you will write code<p>- avoid preprocessors and compilers, they create extra work<p>- anything that can be built depending on a library can be built more efficiently without it<p><i></i>HTML Questions for Learning:<i></i><p>- can I still do it without that containing <div> as a wrapper?<p>- is there any HTML like <div style=clear:both></div> trying to solve CSS problems using markup?<p>- how could this be rewritten without using any classes at all?<p>- what’s the fewest amount of tags I would need to mark up this design from scratch?<p>- what’s the most relevant or correct HTML5 tag for this ([and there are a lot of them!) <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element</a><p><i></i>CSS Questions for Learning:<i></i><p>- how could I write this CSS without using any classes at all?<p>- if I remove this line, does anything break?<p>- what styles can this element inherit from other CSS rules?<p><i></i>JS Questions for Learning:<i></i><p>- if jQuery does this, what regular JavaScript does jQuery use internally to do this?<p>- if jQuery didn&#x27;t exist, what would the solution designed to meet my needs look like?<p>And in addition to that, all I can say is that the more you do it the better you will get! Create some basic templates and get used to creating throwaway HTML pages to test one thing, or check something. Don’t get invested in and finesse and polish every project or page you build or you’ll have a very shallow level of skill and spend too much time on too few pieces.<p>One good habit would be to start pushing code to Github. You can view the traffic there, so if people are viewing and using your code you can be motivated by that.<p>Also, CodePen is like a social front-end coding playground. I would highly recommend you check that out and get the habit of testing and trying things out in the open.<p>The other last thing I will say is this: simplify! in 2013 my idea of a barebones HTML page was a whole site template like this: <a href=""https://github.com/tomhodgins/5keleton"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tomhodgins/5keleton</a><p>By 2015 I had it pared down to this: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/tomhodgins/c09dd6f9485d77d14e55"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/tomhodgins/c09dd6f9485d77d14e55</a><p>But that was still so heavy it was slowing down my learning. Now when I want to test something here’s the HTML snippet I pop into a new text file:<p><pre><code>    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n    <head>\n      <meta charset=utf-8>\n      <title></title>\n      <style></style>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n      <script></script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n</code></pre>\nOnly when you distill it down to the basics can you do it at the scale you need to really experiment and learn.<p><i></i>Resources:<i></i><p>- Mozilla Developer Network for CSS: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference</a>, and JavaScript: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Refe...</a> Reference<p>- HTML5 Specification for HTML reference: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/html5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.w3.org/TR/html5</a><p>- You Might Not Need jQuery for learning JS: <a href=""http://youmightnotneedjquery.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youmightnotneedjquery.com</a><p>- Ditching jQuery for learning JavaScript basics: <a href=""http://gomakethings.com/ditching-jquery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gomakethings.com/ditching-jquery</a>",1454820914

(These are basically what&#x27;s laid out in the article, but broken down more.)<p><pre><code>  1. Change your code to write to old and new schema; keep reading from old schema. \n  2. Migrate data to new schema in background. \n  3. Add a flag to control where you&#x27;re reading from. Default it to read from old location. Keep writing to both. \n  4. Flip the flag on some subset of your jobs. Ensure everything is still running smoothly for as long as you like. \n  5. Change the default to read from new schema. Wait as long as you like to be comfortable that the change is working properly. \n  6. Delete the code that reads from the old schema. \n  7. Delete the code that writes to the old schema. \n  8. Drop the data in the old schema.\n</code></pre>\nAt any point prior to deleting the old data, if you encounter problems you can roll back to an old version of the code. If your schema changes are incompatible, you can make an entire new database with the new schema. This may temporarily waste some storage space, but it&#x27;s very safe.",1454820291

6985071,comment,6984450,6984853,5,0,grabeh,,,"The specific grounds for the fine by the Fair Trade Commission are not made clear in the brief article however, if as is stated in the article the Taiwanese companies had obtained reseller rights to set a price and then this was being undermined by Apple then this is not particularly fair of Apple to then attempt to set those resale prices. I use the word &#x27;fair&#x27; deliberately in reference to the Fair Trade Commission.<p>At the same time, it is likely to be anti-competitive to allow an upstream manufacturer to fix prices with all retailers on the basis that customers are prejudiced and retailers are unable to compete on price. This is the main answer to your question. Also if only one retailer plays ball with Apple then they have a monopoly position again to the likely detriment of customers.<p>The arrangement is however acceptable where the retailer plays the role of mere agent in the arrangement (i.e. takes minimal risk in the transaction as compared to a distributor) as here it is reasonable for the manufacturer to set downstream prices.<p>However here if the article is correct, then the presence of a clear right for the distributor to set prices which is then subsequently ignored by Apple would seem to justify action by Taiwanese FTC. If anything this would be a breach of contract issue also providing another ground for the FTC to intervene.<p>Perhaps in this case, Apple intended to make the contract transparent by granting the right to the retailer to determine resale prices (in compliance with local law potentially) but then behind the scenes exerted pressure. This is pure speculation of course.",1388419173

But then every method would have to take a va_list for its parameters instead of just taking a regular parameter list, breaking the idea that ObjC methods are just C functions with two implicit parameters.

6984943,comment,6983566,6983758,1,0,blktiger,,,"I think the main reason git is hard is many of the most common commands do too many things. For example, the reset command &quot;reset the current HEAD to a specified state&quot; is too general. I don&#x27;t think most people consider HEAD as both a working directory and a pointer to the current commit in the repository, instead they just think of it as a pointer to the current commit you are working off of. So they start by just memorizing a couple of commands that do what they need to.<p>reset -- file #unstage a file\nreset --hard #reset everything in the working directory<p>Later they might learn to use reset to undo the last commit.<p>reset --hard HEAD~1<p>But they probably still don&#x27;t really understand what the reset command does. I consider it to be an overloaded command. There should be a command to unstage files, a command to move the HEAD of the current branch (which can keep the --hard and --soft options), and a command to just clear everything from the stage/working directory to start over.<p>Other commands are similarly overloaded which makes it hard for users to understand unless they learn the internals of git.",1388417166

A halfhearted list of platitudes from a Dean at ASU and an NYTimes article != actual effort. Look at the list of sponsors on this page. <a href""http://www.girlswhocode.com/about-us"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.girlswhocode.com/about-us/</a> and show me something even remotely equivalent for nursing, or fashion.<p>Well googling for &quot;programs to get men into nursing&quot; returns these:<p><a href""http://www.discovernursing.com/men-in-nursing#.UsGOpGRDsn"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.discovernursing.com/men-in-nursing#.UsGOpGRDsns</a><p><a href""http://www.minoritynurse.com/article/men-nursing-schoo"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.minoritynurse.com/article/men-nursing-school</a><p>Both of which show some good sponsorship. Heck, on the first page, under &quot;resources&quot; there is mention of a magazine called &quot;male nurse magazine&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure these aren&#x27;t half-hearted platitudes.<p>Also consider: a profession that isn&#x27;t tech may not have a giant list of tech heavyweights behind it. Again - different industries have different ways of doing things.<p>> All I&#x27;m saying is that, as a low-income Asian person who learned to code, I am not a particularly privileged or rich person. Yet I have had zero initiatives helping me, or encouraging me to code. I have seen several people in a similar position. On the other hand, plenty of girls with high-income parents are babysat and helped by initiatives like Rails Girls et al.<p>This is poor reasoning. Just because there are initiatives to help one group, and there aren&#x27;t - for whatever reason - initiatives to help another group, doesn&#x27;t mean that the initiatives that do exist are a problem. An attempt to solve one problem does not invalidate the other. Nor does the lack of solution to one problem invalidate attempts to solve other problems. It&#x27;s like this: my software has 2 bugs. I spend a week fixing one bug. My boss doesn&#x27;t complain that I didn&#x27;t solve both bugs, but rather praises me for fixing one and says &quot;now fix the other&quot;.",1388417139

Because of the demand for mortgages from the CDO industry, created an incentive for lenders to make as many loans as possible.<p>2. Disconnected the people who were actually issuing the loans from the consequences, if and when the borrowers defaulted (since the actual lenders could immediately sell the loan into the CDO-bundling food chain, thus recovering their money so they&#x27;d no longer need to worry about the loan being repaid).<p>The combination of the pressure of (1) and the lack of consequences in (2) meant lenders drastically relaxed their policies, issuing loans to people who they knew they never would have lent to if they (the lenders) were going to be on the hook financially in case of default.<p>Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated beyond doubt that the larger entities which were offering CDOs to investors were promoting them as high-grade investments, with help from ratings agencies who either utterly failed in their function or were themselves complicit in the deception, even though those entities knew otherwise and were taking their own private actions in the market, aimed at profiting when (not if) CDOs failed to perform as advertised.<p>The result of this is was a large-scale transfer of wealth, largely from duped investors and duped borrowers (for make no mistake: knowingly issuing a loan to someone not qualified for the loan is a form of duping), largely to a relatively small and select group of people who were either involved in the lending and bundling food chain, or in offering CDOs to investors.<p>These are not memes. These are facts. This was a massive fraud perpetrated upon multiple groups.<p>You can, if you wish, say that the desire to play real-estate mogul or conspicuously consume played a part in driving people to take out loans, and assign some part of the responsibility to those people. You cannot, however, support in any way, based on the known and undisputed facts, the assertion that the borrowers bear (to quote precisely the original words to which I replied) &quot;the majority of the blame&quot; for this. The deliberate and knowing fraud in the CDO industry outstrips that as the noonday sun does a candle.",1388416585

But if I can’t have dinner with my kids, give them a bath, and read them a book before bed, something is wrong in my life.</i><p>This should be expressed more often and by a lot more people. Great to hear this from someone I already admire.",1388415786

Making many small apps?<p>Have also been toying with an idea to start doing apps for a while now and rather than do a major idea, instead do many small apps. Like for example if 1 app brings 100$ per month - then making 20 could make 2000$ and so on - but does 1 app make 100$ on average at all?",1388415779

6984842,comment,6984450,6984535,10,0,bradleyland,,,"The article doesn&#x27;t go in to great detail, but based on the information given, I would say that this specific practice is already prohibited in the U.S.. The relevant excerpt:<p>&quot;Apple Asia ... required carriers to obtain its permission before setting contract prices on iPhones...&quot;<p>This sounds like Apple Asia explicitly approved contract prices, but it depends on how you interpret &quot;setting contract prices&quot;. If that literally means setting the price that the customer will pay, then this is not (to my knowledge) the exact mechanism used in the U.S., because the manufacturers cannot approve or deny the actual selling price. Instead, manufacturers rely on a loophole.<p>Rather than saying, &quot;You can&#x27;t sell an iPhone for less than $199 with contract,&quot; Apple says, &quot;You can&#x27;t advertise an iPhone for less than $1xx with contract.&quot; The actual number isn&#x27;t $199, as we regularly see advertisements for iPhones at discounts from retail, but not much lower. We haven&#x27;t seen the agreements, so we don&#x27;t know the actual terms. It may be that Apple has the ability to approve/deny all advertised prices individually.<p>Keep in mind that a retailer is free to sell an iPhone at whatever price point they&#x27;d like. The problem is that they have no incentive to do so. Sale prices are a means to get customers in to the store. Imagine a ridiculous hypothetical situation where Walmart advertised the iPhone 5S at $99; that would draw in a <i>lot</i> of customers. However, their reseller terms prevent them from doing so, therefore there is far less incentive to do so. If they can&#x27;t advertise the crazy sale price, then they can&#x27;t draw in the number of customers required to meet their ROI requirements for an iPhone loss-leader. The inability to advertise props up the iPhone selling price.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t do this just with iPhones, and this is not the only mechanism Apple uses to prop up their prices. We don&#x27;t know the specific margins retailers make on Apple products, but everyone I know who has worked in the retail industry tells me that the margin on Apple products is much lower than every other PC manufacturer. I can&#x27;t speak for mobile devices, as I don&#x27;t know anyone in that industry.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Apple isn&#x27;t the only company who employs these practices. There are a number of &quot;high-value&quot; brands that support their pricing this way. Tempurpedic and Rolex come to mind immediately, but I&#x27;m certain there are many more.",1388415671

6984836,comment,6984096,6984303,2,0,fat0wl,,,"heh yes I always wonder about these analyses -- is the # of questions on SO an actual correlate to popularity? Or is it the sign of an opaque or buggy language<p>It&#x27;s funny (be warned, this is sortof flamebait i know) I left RoR to enter the Java world & since then it seems like RoR&#x27;s popularity is <i>still</i> increasing on these metrics & it is very strong, even though the heyday of RoR seems to have passed. Many are critical of the new releases / constant breaking updates etc. and many viable MVC alternatives have emerged.<p>I think an interesting metric that is never really considered in these reviews would be &quot;Number of SO Questions per user of the language&quot; -- basically SO issues per capita. I think that may actually reveal some interesting facts about which dev platforms are most seamless to work on.<p>I appreciate the open source mantra & everything, still work on open source projects, but it is slightly worrying when I see these languages gaining so much traction yet having such a massive slew of banal issues (&quot;trivial questions and answers&quot; + things that are broken that shouldn&#x27;t be, leading to workaround requests). I guess I have been converted to the evil Java empire (in fairness, I am diving into Clojure as well). JVM just seems more stable to me after dealing with everything in Rails breaking all the time & trying to balance dependencies (&quot;I need to update this to use this, but then this will break. So I guess I need to update both gems plus Rails itself, but we aren&#x27;t budgeted to do a bunch of integration testing right now, so... I guess we&#x27;ll get that feature in 2 years or if it is ever backported&quot; -- Java libs just seem a lot more robust to me, haven&#x27;t yet faced an issue like this except for 1 or 2 workable IDE integration issues). OK that last bit really <i>was</i> a tangent.",1388415611

If you want a fairly easy read without too many equations, try:<p>Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques (Second Edition)
<a href=""http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/book.html</a><p>Which goes nicely with the Weka open source ML toolkit

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Informati...</a><p>It is nicely self contained, going through all the stats you'll need.

In another generation or two, some brilliant synthesizer will come along and produce a real <i>theory</i>.  For now though, most of the stuff you learn as a CS undergrad (other than a few senior-level theory courses) should be <i>obvious</i> if you know how to program.<p>If you do go back, pick another discipline and study it like a computer scientist on vacation.  Pick ONE powerful software package (python might be good, or maybe (sic) Mathematica) and use it to do ALL your assignments.  Focus on simulation and visualization.  You get to learn something real, and you get to do cool software work at the same time.<p>[1] Graph theory is almost 100 years old now, and we're starting to see the discipline collapse into a hard core.  You still need a lot of loose terminology to get started, but after that there's a clear progression through the different concepts.",1194986876

79475,story,,,26,40,amichail,"Puzzle:  100 Prisoners and a Light Bulb",,"100 prisoners are imprisoned in solitary cells. Each cell is windowless and soundproof. There's a central living room with one light bulb; the bulb is initially off. No prisoner can see the light bulb from his or her own cell. Each day, the warden picks a prisoner equally at random, and that prisoner visits the central living room; at the end of the day the prisoner is returned to his cell. While in the living room, the prisoner can toggle the bulb if he or she wishes. Also, the prisoner has the option of asserting the claim that all 100 prisoners have been to the living room. If this assertion is false (that is, some prisoners still haven't been to the living room), all 100 prisoners will be shot for their stupidity. However, if it is indeed true, all prisoners are set free and inducted into MENSA, since the world can always use more smart people. Thus, the assertion should only be made if the prisoner is 100% certain of its validity.<p>Before this whole procedure begins, the prisoners are allowed to get together in the courtyard to discuss a plan. What is the optimal plan they can agree on, so that eventually, someone will make a correct assertion? <p>P.S.  Probabilistic analysis for this problem can be difficult, so try simulations to test out your solutions to see how long they take on average.",1194985792

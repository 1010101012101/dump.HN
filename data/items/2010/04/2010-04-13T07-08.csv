In fact, I think it's too early to declare that a there is a contest in the first place. While there seems to be some level of agreement that partition tolerance is required for real world systems consistency vs. availability is more of a continuum instead of two discrete choices. I find that in day to day work some data requires a paxos level of consistency (say a configuration file containing your inter-cluster topology) and some data can be highly inconsistent (like activity data such as 'read' status of emails).<p>As a side-note, I would argue that all eventual consistent systems rely on some domain knowledge about the data that makes it possible for the system to reliably merge conflicting data. Such algorithms usually have the property that they only move state in one direction, emails only move from unread to read for example.<p>What I'm trying hard to figure out is how Consistent, Available and Partition Tolerance map onto Intelligence, Emotional Stability and Good Looks. Do we always require Good Looks and thus end up choosing between Intelligence and Emotional Stability or ...",1271144959

Presumably On2 had the same due-diligence issues when it was licensing VP3 to others; I don't see how On2 could give VP8 a stronger ""patent-free"" declaration than Theora already has, unless (as other people have suggested) Google has bankrolled an exhaustive search for applicable patents.<p>I don't really mind whether VP8 or Theora winds up being the dominant format on the web, I'm just skeptical that VP8 is all that different when it comes to the pain-points that have prevented people from adopting Theora.",1271144494

The machine will be adding pointers and integers anyway so this is inevitably reflected in C in one way or another. There are different notations to adding pointers and integers, such as <i>&pointer[index]</i> or casting and adding, but in C you still have to think in terms of pointers and integers.<p>Why C? The main reason is that it has lots of pragmatic bias for its use. It's simple (unlike C++), it's closeness to assembly makes it a nice candidate for writing low-level layers, and it's supported nearly everywhere (unlike C++). This is hugely important in getting things done even if there were a number of smarter but less pragmatic ways.",1271142842

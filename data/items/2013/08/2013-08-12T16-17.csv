I have worked at four tech companies. I&#x27;m currently paid 31k as a front-end web developer at medium sized company while being the lead Android developer for an established startup on the side.<p>I have a pretty well fleshed out github account and a long list of completed side projects.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy school nor debt, and I&#x27;m not convinced a Computer Science degree would be fully utilized in a career in web and android development.<p>Will startups take a fresh high school grad seriously?
Is it a mistake to not go to college despite my experience?<p>What would you do?<p>EDIT:<p>Thanks for the advice, everyone. I really appreciate it.<p>A few follow up questions:<p>With my qualifications, how likely is it that I could land an internship in San Francisco this coming summer?<p>I&#x27;m currently learning many new (to me) technologies, ramping up my open source activity, and writing a blog. Is there anything else I should to do increase my chances?",1376326788

The biggest advantage has been not worrying about infrastructure as we grew from X,000,000 minutes per month to XX,000,000. Essentially, you convert any CAPEX to OPEX, with all benefits and penalties thereto.<p>SMS, we had to move over in a pinch (less than a day from zero to production), so integration is definitely super easy. Our volume was much less impressive - XXX,000 per month.<p>The biggest outages have been during elections season. That said, Twilio has taken a lot of steps to ensure that won&#x27;t happen next time around. The response times and follow-ups to any outages have always been very quick and transparent, which is all one can ask of a vendor.<p>As far as I know, Twilio is still the major provider for that company, but I have moved on to ad tech space. :)",1376326660

So what usually ends up happening is the more influential subgroups within an ideological organization control the mappings of the groups ideology to real world issues.

This process is made easier by elected libertarians rarely having to actually do anything in politics.  Since there are no libertarians at the national level every person who identifies as a libertarian can maintain their own personal definition of libertarianism that agrees with their ideal implementation of the ideology and still bond with other self identified libertarians exclusively through abstract ideology.<p>In short, libertarianism can mean whatever anyone wants it to mean as long as it doesn&#x27;t piss of successful white people.",1376325687

It is not typically used in small environments.<p>I think this solution has an upper bar of effectiveness that is just to low for the problem this is trying to solve. The use of a pseudo random number generator ( python&#x27;s random module) is too vulnerable to not generating &quot;random&quot; numbers and so many collisions can occur at high concurrency.<p>Most pseudo random number generators usually are seeded with the time on the host system. As stated in the docs, the best way to use simpleflake is to setup NTP so all the servers times are in sync, the random module on all the servers/processes could be seeded with the same time ( like after a code push). If all the servers get seeded with the same time and the objects being operated on take a uniform time the probability of collisions go up and slow down all processes trying to interact with the objects, as they generate new IDs. As new Ids are being generated you lose the time sort that you originally wanted by including the time in the ID.<p>I do not mean this to be insulting. I am speaking from experience from having debugged a problem caused the the ID generator at the company I formerly worked for. We used a similar generation technique to identify messages passing through the system, but we included more meta data in our IDs such as sender and recipient of the message and even the server name. With all of that when we ran 150 processes on a 4 core server, there was a .01% of collisions, but that jump significantly once the servers were upgraded to 16 core machines and at that point in the process there was no way to regenerate a new ID, the data was simply dropped out of existence.",1376323851

The process of &quot;logging in&quot; is conceptually a single step, thus it makes sense to have one unit that abstracts over the entire process. Factoring out the logic of successive calls into a pipeline doesn&#x27;t seem very useful here. I could see a benefit if it were the case that each subprocess existed and is executed independently, but in the login case and probably most cases in general web development, this usually isn&#x27;t true.<p>To me, the benefit of a pipeline is when each filter can register itself (e.g. an event queue), thus the entity generating it has no knowledge of where it is going or who is processing it. A key indicator of this is when order of execution doesn&#x27;t matter. In the case of logging in, order is critical so something somewhere must control the order each filter is ran.

User is encouraged to then delete mail from the server<p>This wouldn&#x27;t be user friendly in the traditional sense, but my initial goal presumes that compromises involving friendliness vs end to end encryption suck, so screw it.

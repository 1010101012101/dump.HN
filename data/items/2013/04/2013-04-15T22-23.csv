Whoever made it was so blinded by their own economic ideologies that they figured since inflation's a problem, massive deflation must be the answer! Never mind the currency's very design will prevent it from ever really being effectively used for credit or payment installments, like rent or financing for something.<p>I'm so sick of people talking about ""investing in Bitcoins."" If it rises greatly in price (more than a few percent a <i>year!</i>) it's really bad, not good! If it rises that quickly then it's not a currency because nobody will be incentivized to spend it! And the worst part is, that's the very way it was designed.<p>Can Bitcoin ever be used as a real currency? Someday, once the market cap gets big enough to limit the deflation to a reasonable amount. That won't happen for years. Years and years and years. Until then it will be a volatile, bubble-prone commodity with almost zero intrinsic value, because the creators made the <i>fucking ridiculous</i> decision to cap the supply in a global economy that we expect to (presumably) grow in real terms for at least hundreds of years.",1366066786

A lot of our complexity is non-genetic.<p>The real problem is that ""complexity"" and ""development"" in the context of evolution aren't well-defined.  So the way that they place genomes on the x-axis is really arbitrary.<p>> You mean exponential growth, not an exponential distribution, and exponential growth never hits the x-axis.<p>Right, exponential growth.  And yeah, the horizontal line that they're extrapolating back to isn't the x-axis, it's the y=1 line.  The point remains: roughly speaking, it seems like small changes to the curve could produce large changes to the x-coord where y=1, since the curve is so close to horizontal there (on a linear-linear plot), right?",1366066763

They are blind to the fact that a small team of competent hackers about 1/5 the size and cost of their current support structure could deliver better quality, better results, faster. They would rather not admit to the fact that the person they hired was a bad choice compared to what's out there.<p>Somewhat related mentality, I often run into this situation where I see the non-tech leaders of a company talking to each other, trying to get stuff done, and they come to an impasse because each party's trusted tech person says something that contradicts what the other tech lead at the other company said. The non-tech bosses always tend to believe that their own tech people know what they are talking about and that the tech people at the other place are wrong. Usually you have a more hackery or pragmatic one saying something is possible, or should be doable quickly, and then you have another ""enterprise architect-y"" one saying it's not possible, or would require some large cost/effort/time to accomplish.",1366066665

You get back your principal plus whatever amount it take to make you take the risk.<p>Inflation is worse for lenders than deflation.

It's easy to end up with a test that is not about correctness, but ""did line 1 get called, did line 2 get called, etc."". Then you change the implementation, and 20% of your test cases break. That's not to say that they are valueless, but that I think unit tests should be used pretty sparingly.<p>Where I've found a ton of value has been in writing almost artificial-intelligence driven integration tests. Write a bot that uses your service in way, as fast as possible. Run fifty of these bots simultaneously, and see what happens. Then have some way to validate state at various points (either by tallying the bots actions, or sanity checks). Bugs will come fallout out of the sky. Then, in the future, when you get a bug, the challenge becomes to update the integration test bots behavior so that they (preferably quickly) can reproduce the bug.<p>I mean, I think that this is dependent on the domain of your software, but I think it's a good strategy for many areas.",1366065981

I have been offered a lot of full time positions, but all of them have been as a contractor. In other words, I give them a W-9, they pay me for my time and I worry about my own taxes.<p>How this works out depends on how well you jive with the client. Most clients won't work out, so you should be saying ""no"" a lot. The good clients make freelancing (almost) easy and enjoyable. Bad clients turn freelancing into a stressful grind. A bad relationship can be devastating for both sides and run your business into the ground. It takes time, practice and a lot of networking to create relationships with good clients and prevent relationships with bad clients.<p>Dealing with different time zones may be an issue. Every client has different preferences. Some prefer that you are available during U.S. business hours and others don't have a preference as long as you get the job done.

But it it?<p>What is the reproducible, objective process or behaviour this essay is advocating? If I give this essay to five teams and then look at what they are doing to follow its advice, will they all be doing the same thing? What results does this essay suggest we will obtain from following its advice? How can we be sure it will be better than the results we would obtain from mindlessly chaining ourselves to the red/green light?<p>For better or for worse, the red/green light protocol is specific. As such, it can be criticized. A specific protocol has edge cases. You can argue slippery slopes. It's a stationary target. Whereas, vague and nonspecific generalities are more difficult to criticize. There are no details, so how does one identify edge cases?<p>It's great to hear about this one specific anecdote. beyond that, what am I supposed to walk away with besides the knowledge that slavishly following a process can be bad?",1366065612

OR the take home pay of workers go down or rise more slowly.<p>Just because these effects don't happen immediately doesn't mean they don't eventually happen or that they don't accumulate.

What happens when there is a emergency, or you need to pop out for a quick errand? What happens when the person returning it shows up late? The reason you buy a car is for the convenience to be able to transport yourself from A to B, at any point that <i>you</i> need to. I just see so few scenarios, except for traveling out of your home location, that could warrant this model scaling out to other scenarios.

He entirely lived up to the negative EA stereotypes. At my work we deal with another company regularly. They are fairly large but nothing they do is complex. It's just a few web sites, some eCommerce, and some corp. infrastructure.<p>We need a web service method to verify that a username and password were valid or not. This resulted in a meeting with their newly appointed EA. He told us it would take a week, or a week and a half to get it done, because he had to talk to the developers ""make a design, and make sure things done more formally, because these guys typically just start coding, we need them to have a more methodical process."" This would take me 30-45 minutes from start to deploy.<p>I picture this guy going off to his developers and having a design and architecture meeting to plan out this single method. I'm picturing a UML diagram. Oh shit, you also made a diagram about how this is going to use a 3-tiered architecture!? Good one, buddy! You really put Visio through its paces today!<p>This is not banking, or something that needs compliance checks. The database already exists, the accounts are already there, the passwords are already hashed, and no data is being created or modified. We just want them to tell us if the combo passed in is valid.<p>After 4+ years of the projects being run by him they are still stuck in this world where they don't even have the basics done, no automated tests, no automated builds. The offshore dev's log into the development environment's web server. You know why? Because Visual Studio is installed there, and they all do development from that machine. There are many different copies of the main web project there, and only one person knows which one is the ""real"" one. It's definitely <i>not</i> one of the ones that have ""real version"" as part of the folder name. I tried all of those.<p>Any similar experiences?

Your post assumes that the problem is with the function being used to evaluate speakers. That's far from certain. An arguably much likelier explanation is that, due to the huge gender imbalance in computing, the percentage of female applicants to speak at a conference is much lower than 20%. Therefore, the percentage of qualified applicants who are female is presumably much lower than 20%.<p>Let's assume for the sake of this line of reasoning that the function for evaluating a speaker's ability is accurate. If you are looking to invite ten speakers to your conference and there is only one woman among the top ten speakers, it would make perfect sense if you only invited one woman. That makes you good at your job, not sexist.<p>Now how do we go about changing this? Well, one approach is what you're suggesting--affirmative action. There are certainly pros and cons to introducing such a minimum quota, but I find the article's assessment that the cons seem to substantially outweigh the pros to be very persuasive. Inviting inferior speakers in an effort to increase the representation of a specific group at a conference is problematic for two main reasons: (1) it results in a conference that is expected to be worse quality and (2) it deprives women who actually are evaluated to be in the top ten speakers from knowing, and from having other people know, that their value to the conference came from their speaking ability rather than their second X chromosome. Additional ways in which the quota approach is problematic are that (3) it discriminates against the many other groups that are under-represented at tech conferences, as well as the oft-debated argument that (4) inviting a worse female speaker over a better male speaker is unfair for the man.<p>If we suppose the quota system does more harm than good, what alternatives do we have? That's the million dollar question! The only answer I've got is to focus our efforts on addressing the sources of women's under-representation in computing in general, such as encouraging female students to study computer science, getting schools to examine whether their classroom environment discourages female students from pursuing CS, and help software companies identify whether their workplace atmosphere discourages women and what steps they can take to address that. Forcing conferences to invite more women or businesses to hire more women is a highly problematic and very short-term hack. Identifying and fixing the structural barriers to women in computing is a highly difficult but very long-term solution.",1366063615

Python is great for introducing people to programming; however, it is not necessarily great for teaching computer science concepts.<p>My 200 level data structures and algorithms class was taught in Python, and it just felt awkward.

You&#x27;ve picked the wrong open source project, the project is an undead zombie, whatever. If you do it right, it will most certainly (<i>edit</i>: &quot;usually, at least&quot;) not feel &quot;without purpose.&quot;<p>Perhaps consider looking at open source projects and your possible personal relation to any particular one from a kind of two-layer perspective:<p>1. General idea behind the project; its general goals; and how you feel about them. It&#x27;s probably a fruitless thing to work on something you don&#x27;t believe in. On the other hand, finding something that shares your values to a great extent can bring out actual passion.<p>2. This is (usually, sometimes) not enough: hence find <i>particular</i> lower-level goals (these are the &quot;ideological<->technical interfaces&quot; so to speak, or, purely technical particulars (think of some very particular problem or proposed enhancement on a bug tracker.)) In my experience, the lack of <i>attainable</i> (to you) lower level &quot;what do i do&quot; things (which you can use to deduce &quot;how do i do&quot;, and then end up with a todo list of particulars, which always helps to curb general laziness (well, sometimes)) might run you into trouble (and maybe this was something the parent was actually commenting on, so we probably disagree on details only.) You have to also keep re-evaluating these lower-level particulars, and set out new ones, etc. (and this is not always easy, of course.)<p>A good combination of the two can be quite a powerful thing indeed. And if the project is lead by good people with lotsa experience, and if a wider community of smart folk is involved, you can learn a lot.<p>> <i>My advise would be to look at your own network (friends, family, etc) and find those who are in business and ask them about their pain; and there is always some pain that a business has.</i><p>But I agree that this is probably also a great idea, and sometimes more practical, etc. (also, learning to translate business (and sometimes it is an actual business) needs into solutions / technical designs is a very practical skill indeed)",1400374569

Do you like it because it adds to the joint project of the conversation? Or just because you agree? Or because a statement contains flattering lies?<p>Similarly, &#x27;wrong&#x27; obscures: wrong for mutually-uplifting progress in the conversation?

But I disagree with his woebegone attitude about it as if it is his responsibility for the market&#x27;s behavior. And I disagree when he tries to pin the pulse of American thought in 2014. For example, when he says that we&#x27;re slowly turning to a society where<p>> &quot;I do this enough times each day that a simple association has formed in my mind: if you’re not technical, you’re not valuable.&quot;<p>That kind of mindset is abnormal, a sign that he needs to diversify his media intake, and I don&#x27;t think that represents the mainstream. If all you consume is TC, VentureBeat, Silicon Valley, and Betas, you&#x27;ll end up thinking something along those lines. But I can tell you that out of all the people I know, that is not what they believe. In real life, you learn that people in sales, people in social work, people doing non-programming things in life are just as important.

Is a doctor in a hospital more morally purposeful than a programmer at Snapchat? We&#x27;re living on a rock in the middle of space, on a speck of dust. Purpose is what you make of it. Snapchat helps me keep in touch with my sister. Facebook lets me keep track of my friend&#x27;s birthdays. I met my girlfriend of 7 months on Coffee Meets Bagel. I&#x27;m achieving self-actualization though these mundane products. I&#x27;m grateful for everyone working on those products. And I feel appreciated by customers of my social media marketing software, marketers who have just saved themselves a boatload of time and hassle.

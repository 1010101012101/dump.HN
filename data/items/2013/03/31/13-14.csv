5468631,story,,,3,3,netforay,"Problem: Energy consumption by Bitcoins",,"I am in favor of Bitcoin for various reasons related to freedom and economy(some gut feelings). But I have realized that there is one thing very wrong about Bitcoin.<p>All most all other currencies in the world we use are based on some guarantee of the value by some central bank. So for creating say $1000 all they need is a paper and little complex system to make it difficult for others to copy it. So real energy consumed in the process of making $1000 will be may be say $5 (that is max). Ofcourse when we talk about coins the cost may be much more. Some times it may reach the actual cost of metal in it. Let us consider that only 1% of coins are in circulation.  So that is not significant.<p>But what does it cost to create 1000 Bitcoins? Bitcoins are created using electricity. So they consume last amounts of electric power to produce Bitcoins. And this energy is consumed in the process. It is lost, no one can recover anything from it. So for society, net result of creating Bitcoins is always -ve. As the price of Bitcoins are increased now from $1 some years back to $90 now, more and more people will start converting real power into some numbers.<p>I have not done any statistics on this but rough estimates is more than 10% of the value is already consumed.<p>As a person who does not much like waste of natural resources, I do not like this. The people who created it should have found some other way to limit the availability of them.<p>I may be wrong in lot of assumptions I made above. I have not found anyone talking about this issue. What do you think?",1364738377

It starts ""Rice burner is a pejorative describing Japanese-madeor by extension, Asian-mademotorcycles and automobiles. The term is often defined as offensive or racist stereotyping.""<p>In your continued research, please examine the full etymology of the term rather than your most proximate use and address how ""rice"" became part of the pejorative.<p>Bear in mind also that the practice of putting stripes on a car to give the appearance of speed is 40+ years old. They are called ""go-faster stripes"", and the practice is applied to a much wider range of people than your example. Most of the people who follow the practice are not ""ricers"", so your definition here is necessarily incomplete, and I would say negligently so, though apparently due to ignorance and not malice.<p>To highlight some of the history, consider a 1968 usage: ""A Show surprise was the hotted up Rapier H120, breathed on by Holbay, jazzed up with Epilogue Earls Court Yankee-style go-faster stripes along its flanks"" or the a 1989 book on the 25 years of the Mustang: ""There were no significant changes from 1976 through 1978, only a selection of dress-up kits, go-faster stripes, and big, bad snakes splattered across hoods.""

If you follow the industry closely, youll notice the article left out the well known sales boost Grammys performers get. This post Grammy Awards sales boost is a know fact. Justin Timberlake had an advantage, he was the only popular performer at the Grammys releasing something new after the Grammy Awards. The other performers albums were already out for a year a more. We can also argue that the free streaming on iTunes also help lead to sales. The streaming on iTunes is ideal, it is only temporary, so if you really like the album youll have to buy it. Another important data point that was left out of the article was Justin Timberlake's album was heavily promoted on the new Myspace.

So much for that, eh?<p>What you really want is a system based on digital signatures: whenever I make a request I digitally sign it. But the core problem is that I don't want to type in my password for every damn request, so this is being cached between requests and between page views. Depending on how it's cached, there are vulnerabiities -- especially if you just have your browser automatically fill in the password blanks, but also if you carry these ""password-like"" login cookies. A system of delegation and revocation can be done, but you come dangerously close to reinventing a public key infrastructure if you go too far down this road.<p>HTTPS auth methods can help out quite a bit, but can be hard to set up with a custom backend and hard to test against that sort of ""downgrade attack"" I mentioned in my first paragraph. The best of these ideas is to give your users client certificates and thus be safe forever, but nobody has found it useful enough to actually do this.<p>The only real alternative has been to remind the customers to always look for the s in the ""<a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> in the location bar. This is stupid and now there are some proposals for browsers to ship with lists which are ""Expected to be secure"", to avoid it, but yeah, we never really outgrew it.",1364736249

It seems these articles and discussions assume that the reader is all-knowing when it comes to the IP issues developers could face in their careers. Allow me to attempt to fill in the gaps.<p>When you write code, in the U.S. you hold a copyright to it at the moment you put the characters onto disk. In the case of work-for-hire (i.e. you are employed as a software author by your company), the company holds that copyright. No one else has permission to use, copy or distribute the software without the express permission of the copyright owner. Licenses are the mechanism used to bestow rights upon other users (or, in the case of Open Source Software, potentially other developers) of the software.<p>Switch gears a bit: other companies (vendors) providing interesting systems (those that you or your company are interested in using) also provide information on how to interoperate with their systems and libraries. When using the C family of languages, this information is provided in a machine-readable format known as a ""header"" - the header file is source code that describes the procedures made available inside the vendor's code libraries. You include this header in your own project so the compiler can validate that you're calling the library code correctly. They've given you a binary library and not the source to the library to help in protecting their rights to their original code.<p>Now, after years of offering a particular product on the market, a vendor (Vendor A) decides to discontinue offering this particular product regardless of the fact there are numerous client who still use this product and are willing to continue to pay for support. They are not willing, for whatever reasons, to completely overhaul their own systems and incur the immense expense in changing to this vendor's completely new and different product.<p>Company B steps in offering an <i>interoperable</i> replacement to that old system that's been discontinued by Vendor A. Company B created a completely legal replacement for this system because they did not use Vendor A's source code. They created a ""clean room"" implementation of the system. As far as the client's systems are concerned, the interfaces into Company B's solution look exactly like Vendor A's system, to the clients network, employees and customers carry on with business as usual.<p>Courts have ruled that creating systems for such interoperability is legal and necessary. Without such recognition, vendors have the opportunity to lock their customers into the vendor's products. Interoperability is defined by interfaces to systems and libraries. The interface into a library is an Application Programming Interface, or API. The API has pretty much been declared to not be of the expressive type required to obtain copyright protection. If API's become completely protectable by copyright (and thus require a license to use), companies can then limit the ability for others to provide interoperable systems thus limiting competition. In this case, the legal freedom of developers to create tools and apps <i>around</i> an existing system is severely limited and perhaps even eliminated, regardless of the fact that these developers didn't use any code from the vendor in the process.",1364735911

Yet wherever I worked when I was a student, the vast majority of my coworkers were from rural parts of the state.

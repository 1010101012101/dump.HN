4285636,comment,4284781,4284781,4,0,jere,,,"The most interesting story on IPD (especially from a hacker perspective) wasn't mentioned:<p>>Although tit for tat is considered to be the most robust basic strategy, a team from Southampton University in England (led by Professor Nicholas Jennings [1] and consisting of Rajdeep Dash, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Alex Rogers, Perukrishnen Vytelingum) introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoners' dilemma competition, which proved to be more successful than tit for tat. This strategy relied on cooperation between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The University submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start. Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result,[8] this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.<p>>This strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of minmaxing). In a competition where one has control of only a single player, tit for tat is certainly a better strategy. Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament. However, it provided the framework for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise. In fact, long before this new-rules tournament was played, Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoners' dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players. When the Southampton programs engage in an opening ""ten move dance"" to recognize one another, this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_dilemma#Strategy_for_the_iterated_prisoners.27_dilemma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_dilemma#Strategy_for_...</a><p>By the way, if you haven't read The Selfish Gene, do yourself a favor and read it now.

2. Workflow<p>If you're looking to simply capture any binary data, Chute is not the ideal option.  While we will offer access to even more sources than we have today, we're not focusing on the capture of documents, presentations or other non-media docs.<p>If you definitely need media, then we think we're a great solution since our tools only work with those types of files.  That means that not only do we spend a lot of time working through how they arrive and get processed, but also in how delivered back to your users.<p>This leads me to my point about workflow. We've seen and learned that every app wants to use media files in different ways.  That creates a number of unique challenges as a platform: authentication, rights management, terms of use, custom metadata, custom profile data, 3rd party processing ,etc.<p>For many, and we'd venture most, media apps - simply putting the file online won't be enough.  It will have to go through a number of steps and more often than not, there's a need to capture additional data as part of the intake. Put another way, a media file's life only begins when it gets ""online"".<p>We're focused on those use cases first and foremost and think we'll be the ideal fit for anyone who needs the same thing.",1343136728

There <i>exists</i> a low-order strategy that has the same payoff against the low-order strategy your opponent uses, and you can use that if you know your opponent's strategy. However, in many games there aren't low-order strategies that would work well against <i>any</i> low-order strategy so you need to know the opponent's strategy to choose a proper low-order strategy. Alternatively you could use a higher order strategy that learns the opponent's strategy and adapts to it.<p>2. Well, I was thinking that a strategy would be a mapping from game history to a probability distribution over possible moves. Should this be considered in some other way?<p>Sure, you can just play according to the Nash equilibrium and you can't be exploited, but probably a more interesting case is when both players try to outsmart the other player and not just aim for a draw.",1343136516

That means, I will call on that day and ask for the invoice to be paid. I also make it clear to clients that prolonged non-payment outside of terms will lead to a raise on the negotiation. I also make clear that if they cannot pay for whatever reason, they can just call and talk about things. The reason why the default number is low is pretty easy: clients will only go up from there.<p>I personally find the punishment extremely hard. 10% per week is definitely unreasonable. It would basically put that person on my ""don't recommend that colleague""-list.<p>About companies not paying late fees: unless the contract is really beefy to start with, its also a quick way to ensure that good freelancers won't work with you again.

They'd frequently agree to do things like update the address I was paid at which I needed for immigration paperwork, then never do it because they wouldn't pay their accountant either.

No, that statement is still true even if you don't know the higher-order strategy of your opponent: no matter what it is, it has the same payoffs as some lower-order strategy.<p>2. You would have to define ""exploit that,""  especially with the understanding that this is game theory and probabilistic strategies are certainly encouraged. So for example, you might imagine a genius who can consistently outthink you, knows your entire history and how you like to play Rock-Paper-Scissors and immediately as you throw down Rock, simply is able to guess that this is what you're likely to do, and throws Paper.<p>You can beat this guy. Or, more precisely, you can equal him. It's very simple: before the day has begun, roll a six-sided die and memorize the sequence. As long as they are not exploiting certain ""tells"" (as a Japanese robot did in the news a week or two ago) -- as long as they are just making a deduction based upon the sort of person you are, they cannot produce a net win against you and you're safe. Indeed, the Nash equilibrium for RPS is not terribly interesting, it's to choose each of the options with probability 1/3rd -- I don't really have much reason to believe that this changes dramatically in iterated RPS.",1343134981

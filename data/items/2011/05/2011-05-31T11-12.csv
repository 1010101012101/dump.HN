Then if there was a trend, they could terminate the account as they normally do. That's the trend. They broke this trend with me by not only removing the apps but following up with no interaction on my part by suspending my Google Checkout (!) and Android Market account for my company and I for life.<p>Not much of a habit, I had a couple products on there. Only major thing up there was psx4droid. The rest were lil things I did to learn some techniques within psx4droid.<p>The driving motivation to come to Android was a petition of a few thousand signers asking me to produce exactly what I did.<p>Also remember Google did not pull my account for the reason of open source software licensing violations. I received a takedown notice from a game company. As did Yong.<p>So your statements and questions are irrelevant but must be responded to now quite often as it has become accepted among the community.<p>In short: My product was removed from a takedown from a game company & Google Android partner. My only issue was Google terminating my Google Checkout and Android Market accounts instead of just suspending the individual app(s) like they normally do. This is against Google's traditional ways of doing things on Market.",1306842948

2602169,comment,2600865,2602039,3,0,zodttd,,,"Thanks...<p>This all comes down to freshening up my GitHub and removing a Cydia Store product. This will be done but I let this mob mentality continue for too long.<p>I spread myself pretty thin. I can count 20+ projects depending how far into the couple years I go. I have well over 4GB of development files with the majority being source trees.<p>Some of these will be fairly straight forward and not require much action at all. As Xuzz notes here, I have my projects source up on my GitHub, sometimes it just needs to be updated. Also sometimes it is updated, but just lands up needing some organizing to realize it (version number mismatches in code or instance).<p>Most however will be difficult when it comes to who to credit. I found out this is taken close to the heart over the years. I upset someone I respect very much, Notaz, at one point for not giving credit where credit was due. I rectified this with psx4droid v3 which I used his source, maintained a COPYING and README, credited, and kept the source up to date on GitHub. The issue is many emulators have been rehashed and ported so many times. For instance psx4droid v3 is based on Notaz PCSX-ReARMed which is a port of PCSX-Reloaded which is based on PCSX at some point. Along the way it used a MAME author's source file for handling the GTE. The MAME author contacted me for credit on the next revision which has not happened yet, and we discussed the issue at hand was it being passed down so much. So sometimes the credit list is huge and mostly unknown, and sometimes licenses mismatch if you really look at the sources.<p>A good example is SNES which has been rehashed and ported to death from snes9x (and as Xuzz pointed out, will fix) almost exclusively. The code usually becomes a huge mix in the end to the point it's a good luck situation to unravel it.<p>So doing this is not impossible, I will have to find some balance to please as many as possible without going insane trying to figure the sort out. Most being freshening the source at GitHub and checking compliance there. In the end there will be those who will complain and smear regardless. For those in this mob, they would never be fans and/or customers in the first place, but they do affect the overall feel of a company. And that's what concerns me moving forward...<p>I appreciate you being calm and courteous with your constructive criticism.",1306842195

opt provides the ability to run any of LLVM's optimization or analysis passes in any order. The -help option lists all the passes available. The order in which the options occur on the command line are the order in which they are executed (within pass constraints).<p><pre><code>  -std-compile-opts

This is short hand for a standard list of compile time optimization passes. This is typically used to optimize the output from the llvm-gcc front end. It might be useful for other front end compilers as well. To discover the full set of options available, use the following command:<p><pre><code>  llvm-as < /dev/null | opt -std-compile-opts -disable-output -debug-pass=Arguments

I do not know whether compilers 'included' with LLVM (clang, llvm_gcc) have support for tweaking the order. If they do not, you can always let them write unoptimized IR, and pipe the output through opt.",1306841276

I am older, more mature and more prosperous than I was in the early oughties, and subconsciously have a better standard of indicators that I look for, when considering 'how things have changed'. Consequently, things like the systemic corruption and poor infrastructure seem far more important to me now, than they did 10 years back. I suppose I was far less concerned about them, and looking more at access to information (the evolution of the Internet) and 'material pleasures' (malls, entertainment, global brands, etc.)<p>Basically, if I look at the situation in India today through the same lens that I did 10 years back, then I'd be prepared to say that things are still improving.",1306839799

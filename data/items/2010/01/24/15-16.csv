He's actually very down to earth, confessing his love for Abba, and coming up with a great metaphor for the music industry:<p>""The record age was just a blip. It was a bit like if you had a source of whale blubber in the 1840s and it could be used as fuel. Before gas came along, if you traded in whale blubber, you were the richest man on Earth. Then gas came along and you'd be stuck with your whale blubber. Sorry mate – history's moving along. Recorded music equals whale blubber. Eventually, something else will replace it""<p>If you're interested in his music, here's a good taster:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgQyIMX_XU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgQyIMX_XU</a>",1264348445

Each year it takes about an hour.<p>I log on to the Revenue and Customs website, it asks me some basic questions about what I'd like to declare and then optimises the sections of the 'form' I need to fill in. So for example I don't need to declare any offshore assets so I never see that section of the form.<p>At the end it presents me with the entire form which I can download as a PDF for personal filing. I declare it to be true by clicking a check box and I send a cheque to the government (or in a bad year they send me a cheque).<p>It's all SO easy.

However where SSH warns you whenever you encounter a new server, the SSL in your browser only warns you when you encounter a new CA (Certificate Authority).<p>For the browser to behave more like SSH, it would have to maintain a list of <i>individual sites</i> which you have accepted as genuine.  Then if you get a phishing email asking you to click a fake link such as <a href=""https://lo0m.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lo0m.cc</a>, you will get a warning even if the lo0m.cc site has a certificate ""verified by Equifax"" or whomever.  This is a good example of where the current SSL protocol utterly fails.<p>When you visit the real loom.cc site which you originally trusted, you should see a happy warm reassurance in the browser bar, maybe including a pet name or avatar.  But when you visit lo0m.cc, you should see the entire browser framed in red with a warning that this is the first time you have ever visited this site and you could be the victim of a phishing expedition.  Something like that.  I'm hand-waving a bit now.  And it may get annoying for people at first, as they establish trust in their first 20 banking, gaming, or social networking sites.  Kind of like installing a new CA root 20 times right?  You don't want it to be <i>too</i> easy or people might just ""click through"" unconsciously.  But personally I don't find this to be a great difficulty with SSH.<p>Indeed the building blocks are all there in SSL, namely (1) the verification of digital signatures, and (2) the negotiation of a symmetric encryption key.  Some may carp about the protocol or the code being a mess, but as a black box it works just fine.<p>I think browser writers could phight phishing more effectively by thinking outside the box of implicit trust in central authority.",1264347872

You don't have to ""care"" about your work as long as you self-manage and are good at it.<p>However, then the author defines:<p>""Autonomy"" as ""you endorse [your] actions at the highest level of reflection.""  This implies work that satisfies your own human values, which seems like part of ""passion"" or ""personality,"" more than simply freedom of choice.<p>(Also, what's the point of making your own choices if it's not for pursuing of goals you either care about or enjoy, which again seems like ""passion"" or ""personality."")<p>""Competence"" as ""mastering unambiguously useful things.""  I don't know about you but I have never been able to master anything that I did not in some way have some ""passion"" or ""personality"" for.<p>There is the Carol Dweck argument that if you decide you can learn anything, and put in enough hours of deliberating practice, then you can be good at anything.  Given that the amount of deliberate practice people are citing is 10,000 hours required or approximately 10 years, then doing this without passion seems like a hideously painful waste of your life.<p>""Relatedness"" as ""to love and care [about people], and to be loved and cared for.""  Again I don't see how this is independent of passion or personality.  Passion is loving and caring about something, e.g. people.  Personality I think has some definite non-zero correlation with whom you love, care for, enjoy spending time around.<p>Autonomy, competence and relatedness seem like fine things to seek in your work, but I'm not convinced of the author's argument that these things are independent of passion or personality.<p>(Also it's worth pointing out that the author does not provide a ""have an awesome experience of work"" example so much as he provides a Tim Ferris-style 4 Hour Work Week example of ""make a bunch of money quickly and then go spend your free time.""

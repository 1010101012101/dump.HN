9530522,comment,9528960,9530159,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"It&#x27;s a bit more nuanced.<p>Is child care as expensive as he says? Absolutely, it can easily be €600 per kid.<p>Thing is, if you make €20k, so €1600 household income, you get €520 or so per kid from the government for every €600 or so you spend. So you end up with €80 per month per kid, very doable for a single parent. No parent in the Netherlands makes €800 on full-time work, so we have to assume €1600 household income is for a single parent.<p>Even if your household income is €80k, i.e. 6-7k monthly income: typical for both parents working solid office jobs in their mid-late 30s, you still get a little over €200 per kid out of €600 expenses per kid, so €400 out of your more than €6k.<p>There are various caveats, and paying €80 for a single parent is no joke. But it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as saying a median salary goes wholly to child care of two children, far from it. And it&#x27;s unlikely to be the sole or even main reason for child care. In fact, I&#x27;d make a cautious bet that you&#x27;ll see significant part-time statistics for people who have no children.<p>At the end of the day, the costs per working day per kid after subsidy is anywhere from €4 to €20. So the notion that this prevents people from going to work in order to be with their kid so as not to have to pay childcare, is false.<p>As on the low-end an individual makes like €13 per hour stacking shelves at a supermarket by age 25, working a 9 to 5 in a low-end job easily nets you €80, easy easy easy, at which point you make €1600 a month and pay the €4 a day rate. If you make say €40k and your spouse does, too, then you make more than €160 a day each, and so the notion that you&#x27;d rather stay home to save €20 and earn 0 than to pay €20 and earn €160 is unlikely. Even with two kids or three kids, it still pays off in a huge way to go to work.<p>Now there are some situations in which it could make sense. e.g. a parent who, somehow, has a 9 to 2 contract (5h a day), and picks up the kid from school. That can make a lot of sense in a family where the husband makes €60k and the wife could make €30k full-time, and €20k part-time in a 9 to 2 job. In this case the household income is such that it costs €20 per kid per day and it can make sense to work the $20k parttime job that allows you to pick your kids up from school (€80 income a working day) instead of the €30k parttime job (€120 income per working day), because if you have two kids, then childcare costs €40 per day, the difference in your working hours. And then it&#x27;s probably more fun and useful to be with your kids than to pay for someone else to, if it&#x27;s financially all the same. But 9 to 2 working days barely exist, and this is in the context of a cliched family where the man earns €60k and the woman has €30k max earning potential full-time. In more realistic scenarios the financial incentives are definitely such that it pays off for both parents to work full-time.",1431424034

You don&#x27;t have to distribute the source code, but if you distribute a binary, you must offer to distribute the source <i>to the people you distributed the binary to</i>.  Similarly, you can&#x27;t stop them from redistributing either the binaries or source, or modifying them under the GPL license.<p>So charging for GPL software (whether binary or source) is far from useless.  Back in the day I often bought CDs with a Linux distribution on it.  It was easier than downloading it when the internet was not as pervasive as it is now.<p>Having said that, I don&#x27;t think they have a viable business model.

9530513,comment,9526096,9526096,0,0,nstart,,,"The only discipline I truly push for when asked this question is Test Driven Development. Reasons:<p>1) You can still code pretty fast (trust me on this, code moves only a tiny bit slower and then gains heavily when it comes to debugging even while coding).<p>2) You tend to think smarter. Stuff that escaped you in your hastily done whiteboard/skype meetings will show itself when writing quick test cases.<p>3) Your code gets partially arranged at least thanks to TDD. You can skip the refactoring after passing tests, but when technical debt catches up to you (and it will), you&#x27;ll be ready because your tests will tell you where you broke stuff.<p>I look at TDD as a great foundation to build any crap on. At the end of the day, it tells you if your features are working. So even if the features are implemented with crap code, you can rest easy knowing that there&#x27;s something watching out to tell you if you broke anything while redoing stuff.<p>For me, everything without TDD feels like a cowboy<p>PS - My experience in this. I&#x27;ve coded full on idiot style. No tests, no design, just code. It&#x27;s only caused me grief when I look at things 6 months later. I&#x27;ve worked with a company coding full on idiot style. Most miserable time ever. I&#x27;ve coded again in my next company as a smarter person but without any tests. Ok design, no tests, still made my life miserable 8 months later. And then I&#x27;ve coded a full blown system using TDD and meh-ish design. Over time, I&#x27;ve updated the design and I continue to love working on this system. I really do. I look forward to getting back from work and coding on it. Where I work right now, I&#x27;m looking at very advanced OOP but no tests. It&#x27;s ok-ish when someone explains it to you, but it&#x27;s still really scary to even think of making changes in there.<p>So to sum up: my own idiotic coding, someone else&#x27;s idiotic coding, my own ok design, someone else&#x27;s advanced super disciplined design, and my meh-ish design backed by TDD.

I moved from silicon valley to NL about 8 years ago.<p>First off there are two ways to spin this: 1) women are less emancipated in NL because they participate less in the workplace or 2) women are more emancipated because they are able to choose to participate less in the workplace.<p>I first thought #1 was true, but I&#x27;m seeing a lot of new fathers taking advantage of Dutch part-time rules by taking a day a week off to participate in child care.  So maybe instead of the measure of emancipation being women&#x27;s values aligning with traditionally &#x27;male&#x27; ones, maybe it&#x27;s that male values are aligning with traditionally &#x27;female&#x27; ones.<p>Subjectively I can also ay that the Dutch workplaces I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to experience are both more healthy and more &#x27;efficient&#x27;, and my previous experience has been exclusively in hard-working silicon valley.  Plans are important, meetings are avoided unless necessary (and have agendas!), and there is a focus on getting stuff done so that people can leave at six and be with their families.  Overtime is a sign that something has gone terribly wrong, and nobody bothers you while you&#x27;re on your vacation.  This culture allows part-time work to be an option... that is, a 32/36/40-hour contract is actually meaningful.<p>At my previous jobs in the US I wouldn&#x27;t even think about reducing my hours...  a 32 vs 40 hour contract is pointless if you&#x27;re expected to work 50-60 hours a week, better to take as much money as you can.",1431423756

It&#x27;s a markup language, meaning that it describes what different blocks of texts mean. E.g. <b>this</b> is a bold text. The programming language you make games with for your web browser is called Javascript or Ecmascript.<p>But we are smart people, we don&#x27;t need to be nitpicking, right? We know that when somebody says they make games &quot;with HTML5&quot; they mean &quot;for modern web browsers using all the tools available, like HTML5, CSS3, JS, AJAX, etc&quot;. The same applies to &quot;for Android&quot;. The common chain to code an Android game is in the Android Java version. You can off course use other tools as well to get something on an Android device that can execute as a game, but special cases would have been mentioned as such.<p>In any case game making, at least for the beginner, is not so different, no matter where you start. There&#x27;s a canvas and you need to get started drawing something on it. You need to track your game state, images and audio data, you need to react to key and mouse events, you need to write a reasonable game loop. And that was actually the point I was trying to make. Pygame tries to take away simple things like the game loop. But things that are always a mess like the key handling (if you use more than WASD and space), lightning, etc seems to be in your hands (at least I haven&#x27;t found a nice helper for lightning in the pygame docs).<p>And yes, in the end, making the decision to make games for mobile platforms (Android or iPhone), for desktop platforms (pygame, C++, Löve2D (yes, programming languages and frameworks compared, uh)), or for the web, that&#x27;s one of the basic decisions you need to make when starting to develop games.

Neither of those statements hold. There is a long tradition of those with power and no accountability doing many vile things even when it&#x27;s obviously counterproductive or there is no greater benefit.<p>Without corrective feedback, political/personal incentives often misalign with larger social good, and there are few corrective measures that can be taken. Just because there is short-term benefit to some does not mean it&#x27;s any good for the American public. One only needs to look at the history of CIA operations and blowback to see that played out over and over. Even when not explicitly clandestine, these things can flow from pure economic logic - one only needs to follow the development of the military or prison industrial complexes to see that in action.<p>I&#x27;ll also take exception to your description of torture. Any reading on the effectiveness of torture will show consensus that not only is it not an effectiveness information collection method, it also makes future collection more difficult both from the source and in strategic/game theoretic terms. The costs far outweigh the benefits.<p>Torture is great for getting things you want to hear, whether they are accurate or not, which goes a long way towards explaining its use. That and those misaligned personal incentives. And the banality of evil.",1431421521

You also fail to mention that the government pays for nearly all of this if you&#x27;re making minimum wage. Calculate it here:<p><a href=""http://www.belastingdienst.nl/rekenhulpen/toeslagen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.belastingdienst.nl/rekenhulpen/toeslagen/</a><p>I filled in the numbers for a single parent working full time for minimum wage who sends their two kids for the maximum number of hours per month to an expensive daycare which charges 7 euro an hour. The government subsidizes their daycare for €2894 per month.<p>A family making €40,000 in taxable income a year still gets a maximum of €2584 per month reimbursed for 2 kids going to that same daycare.<p>I filled in the numbers for a family making €100,000 in taxable income (about three times the median income) a year, and it looks like they still get about half the costs reimbursed.<p>It actually looks like the fewer hours you work, the lower the percentage covered by subsidies becomes.<p>People keep bringing up the cost of daycare as an excuse not to work more, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very good excuse. I think the actual reason why the number of part time workers is so high, is that people can afford to do it. Outside the Netherlands, if you&#x27;re not working full time, you&#x27;re seen as lazy and unambitious. Unless you&#x27;re doing it for an ambitious reason, such as studying for a degree, you can forget about a promotion or a raise, if your employer allows it at all.<p>In NL, for some reason, the right to work part time was championed as a women&#x27;s rights issue. Unless you allowed women to work part time, you were oppressing them. The government also started stimulating part time work to reduce unemployment. Employers were limited in their ability to deny part time employment, to the point that it became very unusual for women to work full time. So unusual, that those working full time are now becoming somewhat socially stigmatized as workaholics or greedy. Some women are also putting pressure on men to start working less to do something about this very unenlightened looking wage gap between full time working men and part time working women.",1431421226

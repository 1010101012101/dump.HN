The whole point of global warming and why people (fox news) are so stupid about it, it because it&#x27;s not about the temperature that day or even that year. It about a slow and general tread. People are notoriously bad at probability and pattern over time, thus the existence of casinos and the lottery. So why would they get subtle movements in temperature over time, covered in erratic quick movements that appear as noise. (It&#x27;s very cold today, therefore global warming is BS.)

Community.<p>The Lisp community as typified by #lisp and comp.lang.lisp can be remarkably acerbic to the point of toxic, depending on who feels like contributing at the time. Part of this are the annoying trolls that show up; one&#x27;s patience wears thin. A FAQ document might go a ways. However, there are a large number of people who don&#x27;t ream newbies out and really are helpful. lispm here on HN is one of the friendliest Lispers out there and actually has helped me out tons.<p>Addendum: r/lisp on Reddit is good for generalish Lisp questions. StackOverflow&#x27;s common lisp tag almost always gets an answer to most any reasonable question. sbcl-devel mailing list is useful if you want to take the time to posit in-depth technical questions to the SBCL developers. Lispforum, oddly enough, I haven&#x27;t used much. I simply don&#x27;t go there much. I should, I suppose. :)<p>2. Technical. I can do no better than quote my /r/lisp post on this (r/lisp is <i>really</i> good for lisp help).<p>---<p>First of all, consistency. A variety of things are peculiar in how they are named. TERPRI? Really?<p>Second, Common Lisp is a (the?) programmable programming language. CLUEL-esque platforms could be used to drive CDR adoption and cleanups of the original language.<p>My primary gripes with CL are the lack of CDR-2, lack of CDR-8, the lack of hierarchical namespaces, the funky naming conventions & expectations[1], and the lack of deeper CLOS integration[2].<p>[1] ELT vs AREF vs NTH, for instance. Or, LOOP for lists vs arrays vs (your data structure here).<p>[2] See CDR-8.",1378918619

The American Constitution treats government as an agreement among people, and structures that agreement to withhold particular powers from that agreement.<p>It does _not_ withhold these powers in recognition of some divine grant or innate possession of &#x27;rights&#x27;, but because it anticipates these powers make the government dangerous to the people governed.  Given those powers, the people in government would inevitably abuse them, and would over time evolve into a faction or class to themselves, striving to retain control of the government for their own purposes and to the neglect of the people&#x27;s.<p>A government that can consistently and without consequence exceed the powers allotted to it by the people governed will inevitably become an aristocracy, and a tyranny, unless those excesses are checked.<p>(There are other visions of what a government is.  vidarh&#x27;s comment on this subthread is the best account of anarchism I&#x27;ve read -- really smart -- saying that government is necessarily a class instrument that ought to be weakened or destroyed because it inevitably serves the strong economic interest.)<p>Of course, those limits make it harder for the government to pursue the people&#x27;s interests.  But the point is that those short-term deficiencies are a wise trade over the long-term, over which an unbounded government would transform into tyranny.<p>Surely the government can do a better job preventing the next 9/11 bombing if it has all these surveillance powers.  But I&#x27;m not nearly as worried about such bombings as I am about how the government has already transformed beyond our control, and how much further it could go.  I am very sure that 99.99% of us opposed to political terrorism can defeat the 0.01% using it, even while we tie our own hands in some ways for our own long-term protection.  It&#x27;s true that the technology of WMD have increased the potential leverage and destructiveness of that 0.01%.  It&#x27;s also true that we haven&#x27;t hardly started thinking about how we, as a society, meet and check that expanded threat.  I&#x27;m confident we&#x27;ll figure it out.  And even if we don&#x27;t, the possibilities of that violent minority aren&#x27;t nearly so dangerous or likely as those of an unchecked government.<p>So how can any government accept such limits?  Because it is _us_, and we recognize that those limits best ensure our safety and that of our kids.",1378918489

I fear it is out of some fundamental misunderstanding of how semantics work on the web...<p>First let me be clear that there are (at least) two types of semantics on the web, one for machines (bots and screen readers) and one for meat (humans!).<p>In writing HTML, the goal is not to use every semantically-rich tag available and avoid everything else like the plague. Where you can convey extra semantic meaning, use the most appropriate tag available; where you cannot, use a div or a span or something else. Use of divs does not make your page less semantic - it is not deductive. However use of the correct semantic tags will make your page more semantic - it is additive!<p>In writing CSS, the goal is not to avoid classes/IDs altogether to keep your HTML &quot;clean&quot;. The machines care not if your HTML is rammed full of classes; though you will certainly care when it comes to maintaining your pristine HTML. When writing CSS the goal isn&#x27;t even to strive for &quot;semantic&quot; class names. CSS classes convey no semantics, at least not to machines. CSS classes should be used to convey semantics to the meat bags reading the code - devs, interested users etc. Nothing else matters with CSS, write it how you like, in as maintainable a fashion as possible and forget semantics in that domain.<p>Excellent article discussing the fallacies around semantics: <a href=""http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-a...</a>",1378917873

I&#x27;ve sat in #lisp since about 2007/8 and there have been numerous nicks that show up just to ask a few rather philosophical questions and debate the merits and technical decisions that went into CL. They usually end up leaving and writing blog posts about how terrible a language CL is and how caustic the community is.<p>There isn&#x27;t a problem with the CL community. There&#x27;s a problem with the culture surrounding CL that seems to attract trolls.<p>Newbies get answers to genuine questions. I&#x27;ve received a great deal of help over the years from experience CL programmers. Anything from beginner questions to code reviews of various snippets I&#x27;ve been working on. I have received a lot of great advice over the years that has helped me tremendously. And I&#x27;ve seen other newcomers receive the same treatment as well. If you arrive in #lisp of c.l.l and have a genuine question about a problem you are stuck on you will likely attract someone willing to help you. It&#x27;s a small community but it is friendly.<p>Second, CL was in the end designed to outlive itself. You get full programmatic access to the compiler and reader. It is trivial to add any feature a modern programmer may require that wasn&#x27;t accounted for in the original specification. CLUEL could certainly have been useful if the author had finished it and put it out into the wild (maybe waiting until it was <i>finished</i> was the wrong choice).<p>I think if you are genuinely interested in learning CL you need to check your ego at the door, so to speak, and just start from scratch. Write programs that solve yours or your users&#x27; problems and ask questions in #lisp and on c.l.l if you get stuck. There is a wealth of great literature, papers, tools, and a small, friendly community to help you.<p><i>Edit</i>: I meant to note that the reason the specification hasn&#x27;t been updated, afaik, is because it doesn&#x27;t have to be updated.

We are using AES-CBC to perform this encryption, which means that our encryption scheme satisfies indistinguishability under a chosen plaintext attack, where the attacker is able to request encryptions, under the encryption key, of various plaintexts. We are confident that no such attacker exists, and that therefore our encryption is very secure.</i><p>First, it&#x27;s my understanding that CTR is considered superior to CBC in all cases. Second, although it&#x27;s true that resistance to CPT attack is a basic requirement for public-key crypto, AES is not public-key. It&#x27;s likely they&#x27;re talking about using RSA to secure the AES key, which seems normal. (As in, one could choose an existing solution.) But the last sentence seems bizarre. They&#x27;re secure against a particular attack, and they doubt they&#x27;ll ever see that particular attack, therefore they are &quot;very secure&quot;?

6368207,comment,6296117,6304683,1,0,rictic,,,"head.js and require do have significant speed penalties unless you&#x27;re just using them as for tracking dependencies and for developing locally. It may be the right tradeoff of effort vs performance for some projects to leave this going even in production, but there&#x27;s nothing to gain in denying the huge performance boost you&#x27;re leaving on the table by not compiling your js.<p>I&#x27;ll try to extract the core of my argument. The hashing proposal is madness for two reasons: 1) it&#x27;s slower and less secure than just serving all of your js in one file; 2) it will not actually work without the cooperation of a CDN.<p>1) The proposal requires you to have one trusted server that you&#x27;re serving javascript resources out of (because you need to load the script loader and fingerprints from there). If you want fast and secure, you&#x27;ve already paid the cost of a round trip to server #1, and the risk of trusting server #1. The sane thing to do from a performance and security standpoint is to load all of the javascript that you can in that request. Otherwise you&#x27;re going to be blocking on that request returning, then the renderer reaching that script&#x27;s location in the html, then that script being executed before it fires off the requests.<p>2) I&#x27;ll phrase this as a challenge. Try to load jquery from a CDN with an ajax request. Remember, the key is to get the source of the script into memory without executing it, so that you can hash and validate it first. Feel free to try it right now in your developer console, I&#x27;ll even give you a code snippet to start from:<p><pre><code>  url = &#x27;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js&#x27;\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  request.open(&#x27;GET&#x27;, url);\n  request.send();</code></pre>",1378917422

If you&#x27;re giving up CL for Haskell, well, it&#x27;s a different story. :)<p>I never used the condition system extensively (or CL) but my recollection is that when you raise the condition you can also furnish various recovery strategies to be selected by the handler. If the caller doesn&#x27;t handle, it will travel up the stack to someone who does, but that entity is not limited to innovating its own handling strategy, it can also choose one of the provided ones without breaking the abstraction or involving intermediate callers. The toplevel handler shows the provided restarts, adds the retry/fail options and lets the user interactively select one. It&#x27;s pretty sophisticated.",1378917050

I don&#x27;t see how a mobile first approach depends on javascript. In my experience, it&#x27;s quite the opposite, in fact. Mobile first is all about progressive enhancement and starting small. Granted, many web devs build their sites in a way that doesn&#x27;t work w/o js, but IMHO, this should be the exception not the rule.<p>> Most websites don&#x27;t live that long, and desktop users still account for the lions share of traffic. If you had to pick one, you&#x27;d probably pick desktop. So it makes sense to me to start there.<p>If designing mobile first meant &quot;build two websites, and the first one you build should be the mobile one&quot; then I might agree with you. But using RWD means that you only need to have one site, and that it will work across mobile and desktop. Because of the was CSS works, it&#x27;s just way easier to start with a bare bones style for small screens, and use min-width media queries to progressively add more complex styles for screens with more real estate.<p>> I personally find it easier to work backwards towards mobile. But that&#x27;s just me.<p>I&#x27;m shocked to hear that, but obviously can&#x27;t argue; your experience is your experience. I teach RWD classes, and without exception, students who have dabbled in RWD have had a really hard time trying to shoehorn a desktop site into a mobile format using RWD principles. It&#x27;s not impossible but it is really painful. I&#x27;ve worked on responsive sites for some of the biggest publishers in the world and I can&#x27;t imagine how would could have worked from desktop down to mobile. This is because CSS is much easier to use in an additive fashion, as opposed to subtractive.<p>Just my two cents.",1378915860

The only thing is that they need to be explicit and you aren&#x27;t allowed to hide them inside pure functions.<p>For a database example, here is the chapter from Real World Haskell about databases (a bit old but still relevant):<p><a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-databases.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-databases.html</a><p>And here is some example code:<p><pre><code>    do\n      conn <- connectSqlite3 &quot;test1.db&quot;\n      stmt <- prepare conn &quot;INSERT INTO test VALUES (?, ?)&quot;\n      execute stmt [toSql 1, toSql &quot;one&quot;]\n      execute stmt [toSql 2, toSql &quot;two&quot;]\n      execute stmt [toSql 3, toSql &quot;three&quot;]\n      execute stmt [toSql 4, SqlNull]\n      commit conn\n      disconnect conn\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, it looks very similar to how you would write it in a regular imperative language. The main difference is that since they database operations are IO operations then they need to be in the special do-notation block and cannot be mixed with regular code.<p>As for the question of wanting to mix pure and impure code that much I don&#x27;t think it actually comes up that much. First of all, I find that I don&#x27;t often find myself with an impure function that I want to add a side effect in the middle seamlessly - firstly, side-effecting stuff tend to be side-effecting from the beggining and secondly if I do want to turn a pure function into an impure one then forcing me to change the interface helps make sure that I am not breaking any code that used to work because it assumed it was working with pure code. Additionally, Haskell is really good at abstracting code so its not that hard to take a big chunk of logic and split it into a pure and an impure part. Finally, converting code from pure to impure is not that bad - sure, you need to change the syntax a bit but the type checker helps you find all the places that need to change and also helps you check all the code that calles the method you changed so you can be sure that you aren&#x27;t breaking those.<p>side effecting operations in the IO monad so you can&#x27;t run them in the middle of any function and instead must run them inside a special &quot;do-notation block&quot; like I did.<p>You can have impure code call both other impure code and pure functions and all you can&#x27;t do is call impure functions from inside pure functions. Sure, its a bit annoying if you ever have to convert a pure function to an impure one (you need to change some of the syntax and all the places that call tha tfunction need to start treating it as impure) but its not that bad: first of all the type checker tells you all the spots where you need to update your code and secondly, Haskell is super good at abstracting code so its not hard to take a big chunk of code with some side effects in the middle and split it into a pure and an impure part.<p>> to academic program<p>Its a little pet peeve of mine but it seems that nowadays &quot;academic&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a real meaning and just tends to refer to whatever people don&#x27;t like. :)",1378915203

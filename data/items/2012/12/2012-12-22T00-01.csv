The Poisson distribution doesn't account for the fact that a lot of the squares with a high incidence of bombs are adjacent to each other. From my layman's understanding, it appears that the bombs were in fact targeted on a specific area, but that there was a random offset from this area regarding where the bombs actually landed.

Android will display some annoying tips about how to use the app menu and the home screens but after about one minute you are through that. Other than that the only thing that pops up for me are the ""What's new"" information after an app update. Anything else is is by design by the specific app you are using or by samsung.<p>> I was told that deleting crapware from Android phones would be easy, however, it seems to be very hard. Even then, there is no way to know which apps you can delete and which you cannot. I gave up on it. It seemed like too much of hassle.<p>Some apps are preinstalled in the system partition and without root you don't have the write permission to delete it. You know which one these are because when you are in the ""apps"" settings and click on the app you cannot ""uninstall"" it but only ""disable"" it. The result will be almost the same - it won't show up in the app chooser and it will certainly not run. Just take up a little space in the system partition. Why they did introduce that system - I don't know, but I honestly don't understand how you could ""give up on it"" just because the button says ""disable"" instead of ""uninstall"".<p>>The settings are a mess, unorganized, not explicit, confusingly vast, with very bad descriptions and many options on a same hierarchical level<p>Define unorganized. I mean, there are groups like ""Wireless & Networks"", ""Interface"", ""Device"", ""Personal"", ""Accounts"", ""System"". I would agree, it's messy but mostly I go through the settings once and then only occassionally. What exactly was so hard to find for you?<p>> That Play Store! Thousands of confirmation dialogs,<p>Installing and app is pressing install, then confirming the permissions and then closing the confirmation popup. That last step is rather unneccessary but not really that annoying.<p>> updating apps is an ordeal.<p>In the play store, go to settings, check ""auto-update apps"" and you can update all apps at once and only have to confirm when the permissions of one change. Today I installed cyanogenmod and it was the default. Maybe it's not for yours.<p>> I gave up.<p>Why? You still gave no specifics whatsoever what these ""thousands of confirmation dialogs"" is or what ""ordeal"" you have to go through to update your apps.<p>> Scrolling inertia is wrong. Ugh. That's real ugly.<p>Couldn't find something wrong with it other than the occassional odd behaviour but I think it's the touchscreen hardware. Can you describe what's wrong with it? I really don't understand it.<p>> Contacts crashed, showing a black screen for a good 20 seconds. When iOS apps crash you are back to the home screen immediately. (Apps crash. I have no problem with that. But they shouldn't crash like that.)<p>When apps crash on android you should get the typical feedback dialog pretty much instantly. When you have a black screen it probably hang in some strange way (strange because you get the ""application not responding"" screen after about 5 seconds normally). Maybe if you had exceptionally much i/o operations on the sd card at that time it was slowed down too much? (That is one of the actual problems)<p>> That inconsistent back button! You never know what it will do (since it's not consistent, there is no rhyme or reason). Sometimes it means back in the app hierarchy, sometimes it takes you back to the last screen you saw, independent of app hierarchy.<p>That's both pretty cool and pretty annoying depending on what you want to do and what it does. You know what it does when you try and remember it. When I start a first person shooter my ""a"" key suddenly doesn't type ""a"" in the chat, it moves me left. And in some other games it rotates me. That's not something that confuses me because it is so inconsistent that's just learning the convention of the application. But maybe I am ""special"" as I am comfortable with using fluxbox, kde, gnome3 or unity all the same.<p>> That damn menu button! It hides tons of crap, you never know what there will be. It's seemingly used by lazy UI designers to throw in everything they thought they needed and couldn't fit into the normal UI.<p>That describes pretty much my browser, chromium, at the moment. It has some buttons in the normal UI and then there is one menu button that hides all the other functionality. Actually that's most menu bars everywhere: You will never know what is hiding there - until you try it.<p>> The translation to German of the interface is atrocious. Apple make their fair share of embarrassing mistakes, Samsung/Google puts it on a whole new level. Labels that don't fit and are cryptically abbreviated and so on.<p>Reminds me of blueman: <a href=""http://ompldr.org/vZ3M3MA/blueman.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ompldr.org/vZ3M3MA/blueman.png</a> (""Audio Sink"", for the off chance that you didn't guess it).<p>The most prominent feature of your rant is the lack of any specific labels that ""don't fit"" or are ""cryptically abbreviated"".<p>> I have to note that I'm talking about my personal taste here.<p>Honestly, how long have you tried it? I would say at least a week of daily use to get used to the basic functionality.<p>And you should slow a bit down to condemn ""android"" when all you have used is one samsung-modified version. Because that's what your first sentence in the other post does.<p>As I said I installed cyanogenmod on a smartphone today and and I think I like it even better than the stock android on my nexus tablet.

4955225,story,,,4,4,rquantz,"Ask HN: How do you handle billing by the day?",,"Several prominent members of the HN community advocate billing <i>at least</i> by the day for freelancers/consultants. This is extremely appealing to me, and I've begun discussing changing to this billing structure with some of my existing clients.<p>That being said, I'm still not totally sure how this works. I believe I recall tpacek saying that any client who has any problems or bats an eye at this type of arrangement is pathological and should be avoided. I will acknowledge this is the case, but some of my apparently pathological clients have questions that I don't have really good answers for yet:<p><pre><code>  Will you charge me for a day if I have a ten minute phone call/question for you?

  What about 1 hour?

  How will you handle emergencies if you're scheduled to work for someone else that day?

  etc...
</code></pre>
It seems that when a client pays by the day they have a reasonable expectation that you can guarantee that they have your complete attention for the entire day. Earlier this week I actually had my first ""by the day"" billing engagement on a new project for an existing client. They were scheduled for Monday, and on Monday morning I sat down at my desk to start work for them, only to find a frantic email from a client whose webserver had apparently been hacked. I spent the morning cleaning up that mess, and it was close to noon by the time I got to start working on my supposedly only task for the day. Should I have charged my emergency client for a day's work (assuming I had negotiated that with them, which I hadn't yet) and then charge the client I had scheduled that day for a day's work as well? Or should I have called it a day when I had finished the cleanup, and told the originally scheduled client I would work on their stuff when I had another day free -- in this case, probably not until the new year?<p>Billing by the day sounds great, but there are a lot of edge cases that I'm not sure how to handle yet. Most of my clients at this point are pretty reasonable to work with, but they are small businesses with non-unlimited budgets.",1356135175

It was only a short time ago that many Node.js libs were being produced with promises.<p>The most common style I see today is this callback style:<p><pre><code>  doAsyncCall(function(err, result){
    if(err){ // handle err }
  });
</code></pre>
Unfortunately this is prone to error. When writing any sort of asynchronous function - that is, 'doAsyncCall' itself, you need to write it in the following way:<p><pre><code>  function doAsyncCall(cb){
    // .. do some async stuff
    if(// error has been thrown){
      callback(err);
    } else {
      callback(null /* this is where confusion happens */, result);
    }
  }
</code></pre>
When writing such code you need to be very consistent and very aware of what error handling style is being used. It can be jarring for some to intentionally pass null as the first argument.<p>I am personally a fan of the `if(result typeof Error)` style but it is not common. Many frequently used libraries, like Mongoose, use the (err, result) style.<p>Because any async call can theoretically fail, and because you need to catch every potential error, it is common for starting programmers (and even experienced ones) to miss an edge case or two. I advocate using upstart or a similar scheme to make sure your Node server stays alive, even if you happen to have missed an error somewhere.",1356134814

I consider myself more familiar in both functional programming and memory management than average, but I found the memory model to be a bit of a conceptual hurdle (even though I'm attracted to the approach on a philosophical level). Having such a unique memory model makes it a little tough to simply get started writing code right away.""<p>I think that if you understand the smart pointers in C++ (especially C++11) you basically understand the Rust memory model. In C++ terms, Rust has stack-allocated data, std::unique_ptr, and (non-thread-safe) std::shared_ptr built into the language. (There's a thread-safe std::shared_ptr in the library.) We also have a bunch of safety checks to make sure you use the smart pointers correctly, so you can't use non-thread-safe pointers in threaded code, you don't have iterator or reference invalidation, etc.<p>The tricky part is making it accessible to folks not coming from C++, which is an important goal. Any ideas would be much appreciated :)",1356134639

4955197,comment,4953293,4955158,11,0,pnathan,,,"Rust is basically ML + C's lovechild. Sophisticated type inference, mostly pure variables, pattern matching lambda functions, a few other FP goodies.  But it's also a fairly clean imperative language if you care to use it like that. Generics, mutable variables, {}; syntax, pointers, etc. Also, more fundamentally, I see D, OCaml, and Rust as occupying a ""let's be clean"" kind of space.<p>I see Go as occupying a ""let's be scruffy"" space; not really pushing the language state of the art, focused on industrial work; it's like a type-safer & compiled python, afaict. It doesn't really strive to push the state of the art, it seeks to solidify certain well-known taken ground in programming language design, and to be really focused on that.<p>I'm not going to apply a ""better"" metric, I don't think that's appropriate because they are occupying different areas in the design space with different goals.

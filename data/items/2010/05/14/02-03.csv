1346407,comment,1345485,1346114,0,0,alextgordon,,,"I did read that and I think you're missing a key distinction.<p>Custom controls aren't wrong. There's a very limited number of native controls, but a seemingly infinite number of ways to display and interact with data. So all but the most simple of apps are going to require custom controls.<p>Some apps take this further and replace <i>every</i> control in the application with custom one. Notably Logic/Aperture, Final Cut, a great deal of iPhone apps and all games. Done well, this can give a sense of context to the user (especially important in games) and make it look cool.<p>What I object to is requiring a full replacement of native controls because the application was written using Cappuccino. This is arbitrary: there's no reason why a temperature converter app written in Cappuccino should look any different to the <i>exact same</i> app written in Cocoa. There's no benefit of context to the user - the toolkit used is merely an implementation detail.<p>Meanwhile, what would be minor design irritations in a single app are magnified to become major design flaws when they affect all Cappuccino apps. I'm not going to pick on specific things since it's beta software, but if you're going to replace everything, you've got to be absolutely sure it's implemented immaculately. Otherwise overall usability is going to suffer. It seems it would be easier to go with native controls and avoid the fuss.",1273805634

I discovered this sad fact during my K6 education consulting work back in the 80s.  Lies-to-children are very different than author misconceptions: they must be carefully constructed so that they don't install permanent major misconceptions in student's minds.<p>For example, the idea that atoms are like tiny solar systems is a ""Lie"" which simply explains atomic structure in classical terms, and which turns out to be relatively harmless.   It doesn't form any enormous learning barrier which entirely derails our later ability to understand orbitals and quantum chem.<p>Good articles on the author-misconception topic: R.

So you could point your app.yourdomain.com MX record to my IP. I would know that based on your api key that requests coming from you should be created with the 'app.yourdomain.com' address and not maskedmail.net. That capability is actually built into how I have it set up now. If you are interested I would be happy to talk more about how we could get that set up.<p>Thanks for the feedback",1273802762

These chairs are meant to rest your legs, not your back. Your back doesn't need to be supported all day. It <i>is</i> the support. There are people who stand for 8 or more hours a day, you know. And they're healthier for it.",1273802690

Maybe your UI gets to look a teeny bit more unified, but scrolling is almost as primitive an interaction as mousing.  It is carefully tuned on every operating system and changing its behavior for one part of my screen always sets off my nerves.  This non-native feeling is the sort of thing that Flash usually gets flak for.<p>Would you use a website if it messed with your mousing speed or your cursor?  You would you grind your teeth.  I feel similarly about non-native scrolling.<p>The only exception I will grant is for people developing fling scrolling for webapps on the iPhone and iPad, because that is carefully tuned to mimic one operating system on one kind of device.  Anything for more general web browsers, however, can make no assumptions and should leave my scrolling alone.",1273802669

When I post a tweet, I know that it is essentially the same as me taking out an ad in the paper or shouting it at people in the pub. I'm fairly careful with regards to what I post. When I started using Facebook, it was very much about communicating with the group of people you have approved as friends. Over time it has transformed into something much more public, I believe without the bulk of the userbase realising.",1273802529

No successful startup would want to alienate their employees this way. It wouldn't be worth it, just to recapture a few percent of stock.<p>Common stock only gets massively diluted when a company is in trouble.  And usually startups in trouble end up dying, or getting bought in a fire sale, so in those cases the equity isn't worth much anyway.",1273802473

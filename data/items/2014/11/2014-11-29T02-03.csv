I made my comment to make two assertions: First, that the desktop is irrelevant today because more people use phones and tablets, and the spread will continue to grow. Second, that the forkability of Linux made it possible for Android to exist...and, to practically destroy every other competitor for the phone and tablet (except Apple, but Android has a very comfortable, and growing, lead over Apple).<p>And, when Google started down the Android path, they weren&#x27;t the <i>Google</i> we know today. It was not a foregone conclusion, and had they chosen a tech which they couldn&#x27;t control completely, I can&#x27;t imagine how it could have worked out the way it has. Microsoft couldn&#x27;t make Windows dominate on the phone/tablet, despite devoting plenty of resources to the task, I&#x27;m sure Google couldn&#x27;t have (given that anybody that buys from Microsoft plays to Microsoft&#x27;s tune or they don&#x27;t play at all).",1417229982

I studied physics at a second tier research university in the US. After finishing my coursework, I had to pass a comprehensive exam, and present my thesis proposal to a committee. Generally speaking, your proposal committee became your defense committee, and they were supposed to keep an eye on your progress, but usually didn&#x27;t.<p>In addition, the process evolved to make it extremely difficult to flunk your thesis defense. First of all, your advisor had to sign a form saying that he believed the thesis to be defensible. Then the committee had to sign the same form before a defense could be scheduled. The defense was expected to be practically a formality. For these reasons, a student flunking their defense would actually reflect extremely poorly on the advisor. Now the committee members might make it hot for the student, for instance demanding some additional work or analysis before allowing the defense to proceed.<p>In some disciplines, it may have served as a final check to make sure the student had actually done the work themselves.

Linux is a kernel. Linux distributions target a variety of different users, and that&#x27;s where the fragmentation comes from.<p>I guess the problem is nobody really set out to build a Windows alternative at the beginning. As such they got what they set out to build, a powerful set of tools for building &quot;things&quot;. It was never a coherent set of tools design toward making a comfortable user experience (grab a compiler from here, a windowing system from somewhere else, mash it all together).<p>Some distributions (I guess notability Ubuntu, and projects like KDE) have tried to polish what&#x27;s available into something that&#x27;s a good user facing experience. With varying success. Most of the issues here likely stem from a legacy of tools which were not designed to build a consumer facing system, and a lack of resources (and desire) to build a platform for the average consumer.<p>Others, have rewritten the userland (Android) and produced competitive consumer facing products.<p>Others, have continued to build what (I&#x27;d guess largely the developers) want, either to service their personal of commercial interests, things like Debian/RedHat.<p>So different distributions have targeted different users groups. I no more want to user an Android desktop than a Windows one. But I can see how Android could be far more competitive against Windows. The question is who wants to invest the resources in building that?",1417228973

8672887,comment,8672548,8672763,0,0,newscracker,,,"Quoting a few points from <a href=""http://boycottsystemd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boycottsystemd.org/</a><p>&quot;1. systemd flies in the face of the Unix philosophy: &quot;do one thing and do it well,&quot; representing a complex collection of dozens of tightly coupled binaries1. Its responsibilities grossly exceed that of an init system, as it goes on to handle power management, device management, mount points, cron, disk encryption, socket API/inetd, syslog, network configuration, login/session management, readahead, GPT partition discovery, container registration, hostname/locale/time management, mDNS/DNS-SD, the Linux console and other things all wrapped into one.<p>...<p>3. Since systemd is very tightly welded with the Linux kernel API, different systemd versions are incompatible with different kernel versions and portability is unnecessarily hampered in many components. This is an isolationist policy that essentially binds the Linux ecosystem into its own cage, serving as an obstacle to developing software portable with both Linux variations and other Unix-like systems. It also raises some issues backporting patches and maintaining long-term stable systems.<p>...<p>7. systemd is viral by its very nature, due to its auxiliaries exposing APIs, while being bound to systemd&#x27;s init. Its scope in functionality and creeping in as a dependency to lots of packages means that distro maintainers will have to necessitate a conversion, or suffer a drift. As an example, the GNOME environment often makes use of systemd components, such as logind, and support for non-systemd systems is becoming increasingly difficult.<p>...<p>9. systemd is designed with glibc in mind, and doesn&#x27;t take kindly to supporting other libcs all that much14. In general, the systemd developers&#x27; idea of a standard libc is one that has bug-for-bug compatibility with glibc.&quot;<p>For more information, read through:<p><a href=""http://boycottsystemd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boycottsystemd.org/</a> - lot of links to follow<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd</a>",1417228319

So I am clearly &quot;part of the problem&quot;  more than I am &quot;part of the solution&quot;.  I lived in Philadelphia previously and the homelessness in San Francisco has been absolutely shocking to me.  I don&#x27;t live in a great area (near 6th street) so I really see some of the least fortunate people in the city.<p>If I had real problem-solving money (think Bill Gates) I&#x27;d go for homelessness first. I think that as a nation we have a fundamental duty to make sure that everyone gets basic comforts like shelter, heat, food, and water.  I hate that I am paid a high salary to flip bits on a computer while there are people a block from my house sleeping on the sidewalk in the rain.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t really understand why this all has to be portrayed as a phenomenon caused by the influx of tech workers into SF and the Bay Area.  Tens of thousands of people move in and get jobs paying $80-200k.  They all pay very high taxes.  Why can&#x27;t the local government take that revenue and help those who need it?  Why can&#x27;t the expanded tax base be part of the solution for the problem?  It seems crazy to me that it&#x27;s a &quot;problem&quot; that so many people are moving to one area for high paying jobs.

As for declarative configuration, I will grant that. systemd is not the first to do this on Linux, though. eINIT was, though it used XML as its configuration language (similar to launchd and SMF in fact, though not as verbose). eINIT also had the benefit of a modular plugin-based architecture, a property also shared by finit and initng.<p>Change does not imply progress. This should go without saying.<p>No, a lot of objectors simply come from having different opinions on process management and general software architectures. That said, there is a contingent who did approve of the old approaches, yes. I dislike sysvinit, but I can understand them. Serial execution with a concretely defined boot sequence that is easy to reason about can be a benefit to some. In contrast, the systemd approach eschews any definition of &quot;boot process&quot; or &quot;boot sequence&quot; that can be specifically intervened in by order, instead taking the philosophy that specifying a unit&#x27;s dependencies and relative order to a target/synchronization point is enough, the rest being handled by internal transaction and job semantics.<p>systemd most certainly is monolithic. It is also modular, but to a partial extent. System generators and various auxiliaries (journald, but also some of the more minor tooling) cannot be disabled at build time. Certain things like Plymouth communication are also explicitly done at runtime.<p>launchd as a whole is still a much smaller system than systemd, at the end of the day. This is because launchd has a concretely defined purpose. systemd has little in the way of that other than vague descriptions that ultimately amount to being &quot;as much as possible between the kernel and base libs+utils&quot;.",1417227006

Secondly, speaking for myself only, being told to work on projects I&#x27;m not interested in will produce sub par work and will drain my motivation to both work with that team and the project itself.<p>Everyone has a different idea on what it would take to get to the Year Of The Linux Desktop, call me when you reach consensus on what exactly the requirements for that project are. Not to be cynical but reaching consensus seems like the biggest blocker, the fact that there are people pulling in multiple directions I think is a symptom of this problem.",1417226426

488163,comment,488030,488076,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"please don't upvote such ahistorical nonsense.  Even the most casual examination of historical records reveals this to be false.<p><i>In the early 1800s, Pierre Samuel Dupont, an influential French citizen who helped Thomas Jefferson negotiate for the Louisiana Purchase, came to America and surveyed education here. He found that most young Americans could read, write, and ""cipher"" (do arithmetic), and that Americans of all ages could and did read the Bible. He estimated that fewer than four Americans in a thousand were unable to write neatly and legibly.</i><p>people were fine before the advent of the nanny state in 1933.",1235095107

If you look at science majors as a whole enrollment is still going up.  Yes, traditional engineering has lost some of its appeal but whole new fields of study have opened up in bio-engineering<p>So basically all his factual points are lies and all his opinions are just that...opinions.

After I graduated, my first job was a loan consultant and I sold life insurance on the side. Then after a couple years, I found that internet and coding was my true passion. So I took an internet related job (lower pay) with no coding experiences at all, I used my time during work to learn how to code. Then switched to different companies, aiming to learn what I wanted to learn. Basically, I got paid to learn. Not only that, I practice what I've learned at night by coding my own stuff. I prioritized and devoted most of my evenings and weekends on learning. That also means a lot of sacrifice.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is: if you know what you are truly passionate about, you'll find time and ways to pursue it.

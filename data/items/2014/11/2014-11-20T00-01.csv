8633788,comment,8606968,8611778,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, UNIX boils down to &quot;the accumulated cruft of 40 years of bad ideas&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing on the principle of immutable servers, but that&#x27;s a pretty bold claim.<p>I don&#x27;t see getting rid of the &quot;accumulated cruft&quot; as being a particularly interesting reason for exploring the unikernel or immutable server concept. The benefit is in building for scale and redundancy. The lighter your image, the easier it becomes to replicate it and maintain it, generally speaking.<p>Further, there is an argument to be made that building your own cruft into your system is counter-productive compared to letting the operating system cruft handle it. The Linux developers are probably better at it than you or me; unless we understand our usage patterns dramatically better and the options for optimizing them, it may be best to trust the OS &quot;cruft&quot; to do the right thing.<p>In short, I&#x27;m not really taking a side on this one. I believe there is interesting research to be done, and probably useful outcomes to be found, in this direction. But, why dismiss 40 years of operating system refinement by some of the brightest minds in the world as &quot;accumulated cruft...of bad ideas&quot;?",1416444960

For instance Giovanni&#x27;s 1.3, 2.1, (some parts of 2.4 already shipped with 2.11), (approaches for 5.1 were already discussed and benchmarked), 5.1/5.2 (will happen when targeting Java 10).<p>My recommendation is to take that roadmap as a bottom line, but be prepared for drastic changes.

In my experience with logging systems is that losing a very small percentage of your data in case there is an outage in the storage layer is tolerable.<p>That allows us writing code that sends or receives messages using a channel (Go, Clojure) and have sane timeouts to gracefully deal with overload, saving 200 (or so) messages in a local buffer and going back to reading the queue after a read timeout.<p>With this concurrency model queues are very powerful tool of separating concerns in your code. Having thread safe parts that can be executed as a thread or as a gorutine lets you use 1:1 mapping to OS threads or N:M.<p>Back to the original point, queues don&#x27;t fix overload, but I still prefer deal with overload using queues over other solutions (locking or whatever).",1416444334

The general thought (challenged recently) is that only the gray/grey matter neurons &#x27;mattered&#x27;. White matter was just conduction between the grey matter neurons (which had all the intelligence). The final quantity of these grey neurons was fixed shortly after birth and people kept losing them as  they aged.<p>If it turns out the body can recruit white matter in learning then suddenly we have 10-50 times more cells (white matter/grey matter ratio) that can participate in intelligence. I suspect the way intelligence is organized would also differ between the white and grey regions. Not to mention how they interact with each other!. It calls into question a lot of the assumptions computational scientists make in coming up with the complexity of a simulated brain.

Implementations of dynamically typed object systems <i>in C</i> do not benefit from using void * all over the place instead of a typed object * pointer.<p>C itself isn&#x27;t dynamic and it behooves you to use it as safely as possible if you don&#x27;t want your dynamically typed framework to fall apart due to easily avoidable bugs.<p>Whereas you can have dynamic checking which tells you that some object * pointer is a cons cell, vector, string or whatever, if you use void * instead, the type check itself is threatened with undefined behavior:<p><pre><code>   object *stringp(object *obj)
   {
     if (is_heap_object(obj) && obj->typecode == TYPE_STR)
       return t_obj;
     return nil_obj;
   }

   // ..

   {
     int x;

     if (stringp(&x)) ...  // compile-time error!

   }
</code></pre>
If stringp has the signature<p><pre><code>   void *stringp(void *obj);
</code></pre>
then there is no compile time error; &x happily passes into the function. Moreover, the function has to do an ugly conversion to recover a typed pointer so it has to use it.<p><pre><code>   void *stringp(void *obj_in)
   {
     object *obj = obj_in; // cast needed here in C++

     if (is_heap_object(obj) && obj->typecode = TYPE_STR)
</code></pre>
Dynamic typing is a high level feature that is boostrapped from static typing (whether that typing is checked by a compiler or not!) Static typing means that a given piece of code working on a given piece of data correctly uses that data. For instance if we write assembly code which extracts the bottom three bits of a word, and treats that as a type tag, that is static typing: it&#x27;s a static fact of the program that that code operates on data with a three bit type tag, and if it is given something else by accident, like a floating-point value without a type tag, it will misbehave.<p>In short, something has to be rigid at the bottom-most layer. C has enough type muscle to help with that quite a bit without getting in the way too much.",1416442867

Netflix did this and it got them past their crisis.<p>I think you missed my point though, which was that there isn&#x27;t any sort of fitness function being applied to open source. In the closed source environment that it &#x27;price&#x27; (caveat walled gardens). By paying for the software customers &quot;vote with their wallet&quot; on the things they like/want/use. What is more if two folks are putting out the same capability they are incentivised to compete on a vague sense of value. That creates a &#x27;culling&#x27; function which operates independently of the software creators (the only way to sell more is to be &quot;better&quot;).<p>Open source doesn&#x27;t have that forcing function, there isn&#x27;t really even a reputation function involved where bad FOSS would give folks a bad reputation that a <i>user</i> could pick up on (yes we probably all know one or more committers who are jerks but that isn&#x27;t quite the same thing). And there is no barrier to entry so we get multiple variations on the same conceptual solution (I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of CMS&#x27;s or blogging packages there are out there for example).<p>Finally there is the various bits of entanglement, you wrote <i>&quot;And with regard to keeping up with changes, you always can remain with previous versions for some time to avoid the slowdown associated with shifting to new APIs.&quot;</i> but that has not been my experience. As you&#x27;re evolving your product interdependencies in the APIs and packages you are using force them to upgrade as well. There is no island of stability in the FOSS world (well maybe OpenBSD servers or something but I have not seen them in the &#x27;stack&#x27;) Backports only go on so long and suddenly you&#x27;re no longer getting updates from your source as Ubuntu showed when they dropped updates for 12.x LTS. All those systems still shell shockable or heart bleedable, or something else. Because to upgrade that part, needs to upgrade the next part, and so on and so on until you&#x27;ve upgraded everything. And you pay that price again and again and again and again.<p>Much of this is just <i>different</i> than the other model which is not necessarily a bad model. But from a systemic point of view it is hard to partition the work and that leads to inefficiencies. A single change in an API implementation which results in dozens of engineering groups re-implementing stuff, versus a migration model that allows people to move over gradually. The promise of open source is &quot;no capital expense&quot; but I worry the down side will become &quot;much higher operational expense&quot;. And when the opex cost of open source is > than the capex + opex cost of closed software, then closed software wins. Of the folks who have tried to prevent that equation from shifting in favor of closed source, I only see Redhat as a success story.",1416442209

566525,comment,565528,565528,0,0,lysium,,,"I don't get it. Isn't `|i|` the shorthand version of a lambda binding an i? And `lambda { i }` a lambda not binding anything? So why is the result surprising? I must be missing something.<p>Edit: I mean in<p><pre><code>  each { |i| p i }\n</code></pre>\nthe |i| stands for a shorthand lambda, that binds an i.<p>And in<p><pre><code>    for i in 1..3\n      p i\n    end\n</code></pre>\nthere is no such binding. So where's the problem? That 'for' should use a lambda?",1239955127
566524,comment,566365,566405,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"An example, in the 60's through the 90's, many economists created entire new fields of economics by applying it to other domains and vice versa. Economics + math produced game theory. Richard Posner, a judge, started the economic study of the law. Others, such as Olson, Buchanan, and Tullock, noticed that the theories of economics could be applied to the government as well as the market, and public choice was born (and Nobels were won). Lastly, psychologists got involved in economics recently, spawning the new discipline of behavioral economics.",1239955054

I'd argue that an accomplishment in a domain marginalized in a person's environment requires some creativity.<p>When I am not in school, I live in Colorado. So the skiing there is great. So if I found out someone had been a competitive skier at some level, I would not be shocked. If I found out that someone had lived in Colorado while successfully competing as a surfer, I would be shocked. I think that being able to effectively train as a surfer while surrounded by mountains would show some creativity.",1239954865

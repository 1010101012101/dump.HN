Not to mention weird things like some specialised FPGA, GPU, network card, or even SSD that might have DMA'd the memory.  Various bus types depending on the cpus can also have a massive effect - not to mention memory access patterns your code might use.  What about the OS level abilities that you're allowed to use?  Is ring 0, or setting the affinity of processes, or enabling Turbo mode allowed?  Maybe you don't give a shit about the data structure at all, and are just searching for a word with hyper-optimised grep will win.  Then taking advantage of that, you can cheat and get something even faster.  As you can see, even getting into the level of detail you mention, there is still a shit-load of extra details that might be needed to take full advantage of the hardware.<p></arguing>",1335981454

I expect them to be pretty resistant to watering down their course challenge level.<p>Coursera is likely to head mostly the same way.<p>Udacity, though, looks like they might lean more towards reducing the challenge to increase the audience. That feels a little dangerous as they're then open to considerably more competition from other schools. The floodgates are about to open.<p>What Udacity has in the short run to mitigate that possibility is a start-up agility mindset. But they'll calcify in the long run, everyone does, and then what?<p>What will interest me most is to see how many people can take on the challenge level of EDx.

Mainly for two reasons:<p>- Udacity sometimes belabors some really basic points. Coursera never gives me that ""dumbed-down"" feeling. It's more like a real, and challenging, college course.<p>- Coursera lets me speed up the lecture, as much as 2x, and every time I go to a new lecture it remembers that speed.

GPUs have modes where the natural breakdown of memory is 2D (basically by interleaving the X and Y bits), and indeed that improves cache locality for 2D accesses.  But not by a whole lot.<p>The reason caches come in ""lines"" that are bigger than the words size of the processor is not an optimization (i.e. they're not deliberately bringing in nearby memory in the hope that it will be useful).  The reason is that the logic associated with maintaining the cache (index and tag bits) is expensive, and needs to be repeated for each ""thing"" you have in the cache.  So by making the ""things"" bigger (e.g. the 512 bit cache line on modern CPUs) you reduce the overhead of the bookkeeping.",1335981078

That said, I think it does offer explanation for their weakness in social to date: they didn't really see it as a threat until it became one. It's very easy to see why Facebook's ad platform can be a threat to Google's ad platform in hindsight (i.e., right now), but it wasn't back when Facebook was first taking off. It's hard to blame Google for not seeing Facebook as an existential threat before it turned into one.<p><i>""Say Google is approaching social as an information gathering problem, and Facebook is approaching social as a users-interacting problem, then who will always win social under those conditions?""</i><p>For Google, it's not about winning social, per se; it's about winning advertising. Facebook is trying to win social. Google is trying to prevent social from devastating its ad platform, and at the moment, it seems to think that putting up a valiant fight to carve out a piece of social is the best solution to that problem. That's why Google thinks it ""needs"" social. It may or may not actually <i>need</i> to win social, but it needs to defend and improve its ad platform, and social is a big threat to that platform. Accordingly, I'd argue that Google's approach to social has been defensive, and not offensive. (Ironically, that may also explain its not being able to ""get"" social so far).",1335980995

This was the only mention of Stanford. This clause was only added because Stanford legal requested it since the classes were taught by the Stanford professors who set up the system, of their own initiative and definitely not something initiated from the bureaucratic side of the institution. Your post suggests that the certificates indicated they were granted or approved or validated in some way by Stanford. This is not the case at all, it is the opposite. I recommend you track down one of these certificates and examine it to your satisfaction.<p>As far as Coursera, it didn't exist in Fall. It was created in response to Stanford lawyers and bureaucrats going apeshit and shutting the venture down once they saw what a threat it was since the classes were as good as what they were charging for. This caused several of their best professors to resign and leave Stanford.<p>Stanford is about their reputation, which comes from their top notch professors. With professors leaving, the reputation is worth less than before.<p>Stanford intentionally isolated themselves from this venture and tried to punish those who pursued it. This shows how committed their administration and legal staff are to the future of education. Not at all, in direct conflict to their most progressive and talented professors.<p>The future clearly belongs the rogues who are leaving the inefficient and ineffective old system behind to join the ground level grass roots work of modernizing education. This is something that institutions are showing themselves incapable of doing, and it scares them. They won't go down easily. They will fight this, attack the new paradigms, and try their damnedest to retain an economy based on buggy whips that supports their institutional power, wealth and obsolete practices. Many on the forefront such as Salman Khan do not have any teaching credentials or background, and that is how it must be for the old practices do not work.",1335980253

As it works now, if you read a cell from memory, the area in memory around it is brought into the cache. Because of the way that arrays are represented in memory, what you get in the cache is just cells from the same row (or column). This means that if you need to access neighboring cells above of below the current cell you're not making any use of the cache. The way I see it, it might be useful if the system could somehow instruct the memory to bring a different-shaped block into the cache. Maybe there will be a whole part of memory intended for 2-dimensional arrays, and where blocks of memory will be allocated as squares on the plane (instead of segments on a line). Of course, something like this would require support from the programming language, which would need to mark put 2-dimensional arrays in that special part of the memory (and allocation will be much harder, now that you need to allocate 2-dimensional chunks).",1335980000

I would like to mention that in Plasma Netbook (the netbook-optimized edition of our workspace) we've tried a sort of alternative approach where if windows maximize, we disable the borders and merge the window controls into the top panel, to achieve the space saving. You can also set that up in Plasma Desktop of course.<p>As for app menu in a panel: That's actually something we had back in KDE 3.x but are still lacking in the KDE 4 mainline at present, mainly because it's taken a while to coordinate the standard with folks like Canonical and because we really wanted the core patches to be integrated at the Qt level. Things look to be coming together now for the upcoming 4.9 release, though I believe (K)Ubuntu has actually been shipping the patches for a while already, for the benefit of KDE apps running in Unity, but also to support the same sort of arrangement in KDE workspaces.<p>As for CSDs, there's bunch of other things they break that I didn't list in the original post. For example, with WM-provided decos, the window manager can detect when you're trying to interact with a frozen app and offer to kill it, which is in fact something we're doing. If you move the deco into the app process, though, well, then it hangs together with the app, and things get a little more complicated.

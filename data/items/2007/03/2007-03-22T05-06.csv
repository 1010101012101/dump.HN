I've a once a week class next to Fred's A-list PhD office at UNC.<p>This added social networking does not surprise me - Fred's report on social networking has been widely quoted so I am sure this must not be a weekend job to look cool.",1174542846

The book that has helped me out the most is Getting Things Done by David Allen:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done</a><p>
It's better than any other personal development book.

Startups that deal with technology for technology, in other words, are trying to solve problems of the technology itself. You should create something that will bring a better life for the slashdot nerd reader and to the 3rd world 60th years old retired ""guy""<p>Do something that will make people happy, to feel better to waste less time and you'll be starting something with more survival probability.<p>I don't agree with the derivative idea concept. Google is the worse example you could have used. Before google we had yahoo and a bunch of spider/bot search engines. Their idea wasn't original, they just did something better aiming to solve search problem helping people not to waste their time.<p>More than just to create a search engine they created a way to make your life easier.<p>regards

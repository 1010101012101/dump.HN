In my experience, the solution is more, smaller, feature-specific branches that get merged back to master quickly (within a couple of days if possible). If you need to maintain a long-running feature branch, it should frequently be rebased on top of master so that at any given point the likelihood of major conflicts is reduced.",1382032792

Besides her one caveat at the end of the article, the author seems to be making the case that this study implies that cultural factors are non-existent. I don&#x27;t see how that makes any sense. One might also conclude from the study that in the absence of economic pressures, cultural forces have a much greater effect on gender inequality. Perhaps wealthy countries can spend more on luxuries like toy dolls and action figures that have a conditioning effect on young boys and girls?",1382032745

6567004,comment,6565038,6566014,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> A serious question: why is it an inherently good thing for reelection to be less assured?<p>Its a good thing for there to be meaningful choices in general election. Gerrymandering to maximize competitive districts is one way to acheive very minor improvements in this area (party-blind redistricting isn&#x27;t likely to do much at all), at the cost of creating a small number of hypermajority districts.<p>Better ways to do it don&#x27;t focus on redistricting, but focus on changing the election and nomination system so that:
1) There are more parties that are competitive than in FPTP, and
2) Competitive parties are incentivized to offer more candidates than they currently are for any given election (which, currently, is the seats they are likely to win, rounded up to the nearest whole number.)<p>STV, or a similar candidate-centered proportional system, in multimember districts for legislative elections is one way to do this, and supports both more viable parties and more candidates per party, and thus more viable choices in general elections. And, like any multimember district proportional system, it reduces the impact of reapportionment methods, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about trying to control gerrymandering.",1382032719

In its current state, with its current sales, of course not.<p>But with its <i>potential</i> state, its reinvention of automobiles, is it?<p>That part is very, very hard to say. In a world where Tesla was the only real electric car player, sure, we know electric is the way forward. But their competitors aren&#x27;t incompetent, and they aren&#x27;t sitting still. We are seeing full-EV cars come out of every major car manufacturer, and they&#x27;re improving rapidly.<p>We also know that the high end of the electric car market is just a test environment, the real battle will be fought in the &quot;regular car&quot; market. Not the Roadster, not the Model S, and not the new SUV. Tesla may have beaten everyone to the punch and built incredible luxury automobiles, but can it beat the incumbents when pricing pressure is very real, and very heavy?<p>I believe in electric cars, but I am very skeptical that Tesla will beat GM, Ford, Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, and Hyundai in the low/mid-end.<p>I&#x27;m also skeptical that they can maintain their current lead when luxury automakers like BMW and Daimler want a slice of the pie.<p>Tesla surely has done a lot to dispel the negative connotations of electric cars, but where they go from here is anyone&#x27;s guess. There is way too much uncertainty to IMO justify such an insane valuation.<p>Think about it this way: Apple was first to market with the iPhone, a device that dispelled many perceptions about smartphones being stupid, clunky, and only for businesspeople. It was beautiful, and it was a wild departure from anything seen up until that point - and most importantly, it was incredibly well executed. For a little while it looked like the iPhone was going to swallow the world.<p>And then Android showed up and completely ate the low and mid-end markets. Apple isn&#x27;t dead by any means, and perceptually they are still the top dog in town, but anyone who bet on Apple assuming majority market share is now, well, wrong.<p>In Apple&#x27;s case, the competitor sort of came out of nowhere - Android I don&#x27;t think was a serious contender on anyone&#x27;s radar initially. In Tesla&#x27;s case, they are going up against very experienced, very wealthy, and very serious competitors - competitors who have in recent years demonstrated their ability to adapt to market conditions and turn themselves around. Anyone who still sees the big automakers are stodgy and unable to change should go look at what the Ford Motor Co has done recently.",1382032627

I&#x27;m only joking, but seriously, does anyone remember how lightning fast VS6 was?  That was over 15 years ago with much slower computers.  I guess application &#x27;snappiness&#x27; has not been a priority for the Visual Studio decision makers.<p>I&#x27;ve used VS since the late 90s (writing node.js in ST2 now) and honestly appreciate the hard work and cool features that goes into it.  The new VS2013 feature that shows how often a function is referenced is useful.  I don&#x27;t get that in ST2 and probably never will.  But I&#x27;ve used VS enough that I&#x27;ve become philosophically opposed to it and other similar IDEs.  The core of the problem for me was that all the fancy wizards and project templates are not maintainable for MS.  There were a number of times I was using some new project type introduced in a version of VS only to find the template was incompatible in the <i>next</i> version (e.g. reporting in 2005).  This inevitably lead to a lot of unexpected work when my team would upgrade.  Many of the productivity wizards impose hidden debt on their users.<p>Another major gripe was that VS would get really sludgy for solutions with a great number of projects/files.  Take note that whenever you see MS demo a hot new feature, it&#x27;s always with a very simple solution.  Also, VS would block for me a lot, but that was probably due using too many plugins.  I&#x27;d find that an application freeze of even 2 seconds would distract me.  Not an issue I face now with a text editor + repl.<p></rant>",1382032314

I applaud the author for taking initiative and I&#x27;m so happy that people are looking at drugs that are anecdotally supposed to have these positive effects, but ultimately the weaknesses inherent in testing a schedule I drug without gov&#x27;t approval sink any real findings.<p>That being said, I find this experiment fascinating. I&#x27;ve taken LSD several times and intend to take it again in the future, and I&#x27;ve always had incredibly positive times with the drug in active doses (>150 micrograms each time). I think it&#x27;s not illogical to assume that some of the positive benefits can be reached with a much smaller dose, but I agree with the author that anecdotal evidence is not convincing enough on this point.<p>Were this experiment to be repeated, I would like to see several key changes:
- A more accurate knowledge of the EXACT dosages used. LSD, as many have pointed out, is keen to react and de-nature. A chemist making and distributing the chemicals in a more professional manner than tabs from silk road would be a huge step forward
- A broader user base to sample on. Drugs don&#x27;t necessarily have the same effects, at the same dosages, for different people. I believe that the author didn&#x27;t receive positive effects from his dosages, but that might be the dosages or him or it might do nothing.<p>These nagging points hinder an otherwise very well-thought-out and conducted study.",1382031823

The good thing is that it&#x27;s backwards compatible to Gentoo&#x27;s source based package manager &quot;emerge&quot; and a very easy to use.<p>What Linux/Unix distro you use is up to you though and I will not start a debate. I understand that it makes sense in the enterprise field to only use the most popular and stable OS, to benefit from the Community and Support.<p>However OSX and Linux Mint, Fedora and Sabayon are the most User Friendly Linuces that I know from my experience. And I&#x27;ve tried most of the stuff on DistroWatch and some that aren&#x27;t even listed on DistroWatch.<p>No matter how you dislike Windows, it&#x27;s still a very solid platform to develop Desktop or Web Applications. I am biased, because I don&#x27;t like Microsoft, but that doesn&#x27;t allow me to judge on the effectivity of their software. It does the job. The same, or better can be said about Mac OSX, Ubuntu, Sabayon, Arch Linux and Gentoo which are the most developer friendly environments you can get your hands on. Never force your top developer or sysadmin to use another Linux/Unix than he prefers! Really don&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s like giving your Top-Employee an ugly haircut, he&#x27;ll leave and not come back or loose effectivity.<p>Now in practice you might say, this is different and people have their tastes. Totally right and they have their right to like what they want!!
But I introduced an entire development team consisting of about 20 people to Mac OSX and Ubuntu. They had the choice to choose their favorite development environment, but 50% of them switched to Ubuntu, 30% switched to Mac OSX and 20% stayed with Windows. The latter stayed with Windows, because it was too much hassle for them to port all projects and settings over. Even the most fanatic Windows user tried Ubuntu Linux out and was totally blown away after a week of trial.<p>This helped us to standardize development standards and deploy Ubuntu images to new employees so that they don&#x27;t have to manually set things up, but can start working after only a few minutes of waiting.<p>At the time I arrived at the company, I had to use Windows although I requested using my favorite Linux distro. They simply had &quot;no time&quot;, to allow me setting the machine up. The result: The Windows box I got was very instable and their ancient svn architecture (without development branch!! All changes were live and they had 500+ customers) continuously helped to crash the buggy Eclipse installation they gave me (weren&#x27;t allowed to fix it myself).<p>That made the impression that I work slow, so the Boss sat next to me and stress-tested my ability to live-code what he braindumps into production within 10min while looking over my shoulder. They still use my work and yes, I could finally convert them partly to Git after some months. However I was moved to management and a slow OSX box. Don&#x27;t get a wrong impression, I had to now work on many APIs, many Back-Ends and integrate our software. And additionally hang on the phone/headset talking with tech or ceo/sales while doing that. So after dealing with their customers and organizing things, I couldn&#x27;t but quit the job. It was boring and I didn&#x27;t learn new things, but were forced to use the slow or buggy machine even though I noticeably  made things more effective internally.  They basically used me as much as they were able to, making empty promises all way long. And to be honest, they weren&#x27;t even able to do that correctly, they could&#x27;ve used me to do much more, but wanted me to focus only on core-value problems.

Not that it matters here, but I believe the job of the government is to provide safety for its people: safety from hunger, poverty, sickness and foreign threats. I would love to see the US get its social programs right, expanding some of them to provide a broader and more sane social safety net for those in need. At the same time, I&#x27;d love to cut the spending on the military to fund the social programs. Then, I would want to get rid of things like the IRS in favor of a much simpler system. Basically, dramatically reduce the cost of running the government, but boost things that are actually important.<p>The problem is that there now really are three parties: Dems, GOP, and the tea party. While historically there have been many nutcases that got elected, our current problem is that the tea party consists of people with extreme far right, even anarchist views. Moreover, they have enough people in the House to cause trouble. The thing is, they win in either case: if they manage to shut the government down, or hinder some of its functions, they are doing what they promised. If they do not, they can still cause enough trouble and blame the system they are a part of.<p>In the long run, I actually hope that the republicans divorce themselves from the tea party, and become slightly more centrist.

Git encourages lots of branching that in most cases is unnecessary (e.g. making feature branches for everything, never committing directly into master). When working with a team, everybody should be working on as close to the same codebase as possible, to prevent difficult merges later on. In my view, merging has a very non-linear cost based on how far apart the branches are, both in terms of time and amount of code changed, because it&#x27;s more likely that the merge will have more tangled dependencies, and the code will be less fresh in the mind of whoever&#x27;s merging.<p>Merge commits can also hide lots of information, like exactly how any merge conflicts were resolved, since they&#x27;re buried in what is basically a squashed commit of everything in the merged branch since it diverged.<p>And finally, they make the commit history much harder to understand.

Nice break down on the why not here: <a href=""http://peakoilbarrel.com/worlds-largest-oil-producer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peakoilbarrel.com/worlds-largest-oil-producer/</a><p>Further to the questions on cost, The &quot;boom&quot; of domestically produced oil is not cheap oil. Fracking for oil costs much more than conventional drilling. More rigs, more steel, more fluids, more people, more water. All requiring much more capital float to frack and re-frack. All for lower yields per well compared to a conventional oil well. Fracking places a new - higher - floor under oil prices. If a glut does develop in supply (i.e. the economic doldrums continue to suppress global consumption rates) and the price were to drop, the companies fracking for oil would be in economic trouble very quickly. The companies fracking for natural gas are struggling to stay afloat for just this reason - a fracked gas well produces a huge initial rush, a glut of gas in storage and market prices below production costs. They&#x27;re all selling assets and pimping for new sucker-er, investors to stray afloat while they push for export permits to sell off the backlog and drive up prices. Should the economic picture brighten and global consumption rates return to say 2006 levels, we&#x27;ll see that the production rates and production scaling capabilities of the fracking fields, tar sands, etc., are not in the same league as the conventional oil fields on which our economy was built. Supplies will tighten as they did in &#x27;07-&#x27;08, prices will rise, drawing in more frackers and the economy will tank. Wash, rinse, repeat.",1382030204

But the examples you showed were simply bad comments. Just because there are bad coders out there who don&#x27;t care about the quality of their comments for whatever reason, isn&#x27;t a reason to avoid comments. I&#x27;d treat anyone who wrote that first sample comment in a similar way I&#x27;d treat a programmer who writes unreadable code; that is, probably take the time to teach them some good commenting practices.<p>Many of the reasons that speak against commenting apply to good variable names, too. Maybe someone will come later and change the way the variable is used but won&#x27;t change the name. It doesn&#x27;t mean we should avoid descriptive variable names, though.<p>Also, with comments, as with any form of communication, the audience is the key. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a senior programmer somewhere and I&#x27;m writing comments. Often the train of thought seems to be &quot;well, using this variable name/adding this comment clears it up for me&quot;. But that&#x27;s usually not nearly enough for junior coders who are new to the codebase, and who are often the target audience. They&#x27;ll probably still go &quot;wtf&quot; after reading a comment aimed at a senior programmer with an understanding of the codebase and a programming experience to match.<p>In addition, the obvious point to make is also that code is good at answering how, not why.<p>This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine, I guess since I&#x27;ve met relatively many coders who claim that good code should comment itself and ditched commenting altogether.

No, they didn&#x27;t do a PR thing for Apple (ah, the vote down?), they wanted Windows 7 back. The daughter stopped using the laptop in favor of a tablet, which in its self is interesting, and boy asked for a Win 7 desk top for the following birthday, which he got. The two Win 8 laptops are currently sitting under my desk gathering dust as I type.<p>In retrospect I asked them both why, and both said it was essentially that Win 8 is an OS for a tablet, not a laptop or desktop. On a tablet, fine, other wise, not frustrating and close to unuseable.<p>Later on, I had to rush out and immediately buy a new PC for me. I had zero choice and had to buy a Win8 PC. I nearly cried. I hated it, and couldn&#x27;t get my head round how I could have several application running, switch, and all that. It was like everything is locked in to full screen, and so on. The one single thing that saved it, was installing the classic menu thing, which I could configure to make Win 8 have a start menu, boot to desk top and remove the hotspot things. Now Win 8 runs like Win7, Vista, etc, Im fairly happy with it. The only problem for me now is that nagging feeling that a load of un-necessary Metro stuff is chugging int he back ground.<p>Lastly, No1 son (20) had to get a new laptop, and was again stuck with Win8. The classic menu thing has saved his day too. Shame I didnt know about it at the time for the other two.<p>No3 son (16), is due a new PC, and he was essentially refusing anything with win8, and was prepared to go second hand to avoid it. Now he knows he can get round metro in various ways, he&#x27;s much happier about the idea of a Win8 machine.<p>Over all though, the one thing I want to know is why on earth a UI so obviously designed for a touch screen is being forced on laptop and desk top users which mice and keyboards and not touch screens. I have not used Win8 on a touch screen tablet, but I imagine it might work well. Now, Im quite happy with Win 8 as long as I get straight to the desktop, have a start menu as it vaguely was before, and can completely avoid metro. Win8 is fine, its just having this tablet UI forced on to my PC I have areal issues with.<p>Oh, never found a way for my 2nd screen to work with the metro thing either.<p>Lets hope my experience is somehow valid enough not to be voted down.",1382029264

Outline a path you took, tell us where you went wrong and why.<p>Looking forward to more in this series.<p>OP what do you recommend as reading material? Any books/authors that helped you?",1382029257

Orders pile up during that interval, and then they&#x27;re processed in random order.  If things start to go really, <i>State-concerning</i> hinky, then authorities &quot;pull the plug&quot; before the next interval is up.<p>Anything less, to my mind, serves point-shaving and profiteers, rather than real investment.<p>Then, all the &quot;gearheads&quot; can go back to doing useful science.  And maybe getting paid decent wages and benefits for doing so.<p>/grump",1382029256

I don&#x27;t think git differentiates between moving something within a file and moving it between files the way other systems do, but as far as I know there aren&#x27;t any systems that actually understand and track refactorings rather than tracking diffs.",1382029234

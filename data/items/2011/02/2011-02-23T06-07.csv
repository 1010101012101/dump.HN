They can opt in to see more if they want.<p>The idea might work better if it is combined with some more onerous mechanism to join classes late - a fee, a requirement for an endorsement from a member or someone. Charging a fee for access to the more '1337' earlier classes might be a good way to monetise the site; the fees could either be flat, or could escalate (exponentially?) with the age of the class and / or the number of people who pay to join it late (possibly with a discount applied as active members leave).<p>Classes might get too small due to attrition - coalescing older classes when they get too small might be a solution to this - it might also make sense to increase class sizes (exponentially?) as the site gets more popular.",1298444374

If you mean, ""as a tech blog you can't ignore Apple, Google, etc. and still make tons of money and eventually sell out to a media empire"", then OK, we have some common ground.

I've also used ruby for small personal projects and tried both Sinatra and Rails. Between the two, I prefer a small micro framework as it gives me a feeling of a more control and less of a glue-together things approach.<p>I know that Rails would be an ideal framework for this kind of web app, there are a lot of gems that solve most common features (auth, forms etc).<p>So I wonder if anyone here went with a micro framework route and had no regrets at the end, even if a lot of time was wasted by re-inventing the wheels.<p>Another issue is the structure of code / files using a micro framework.

They have the two key parts down that nobody else seems to offer for small/medium businesses:<p>- A PCIDSS compliant payment information store that's above the level of the payment gateway. The big win is that if you decide to switch gateways (or are forced to switch gateways, because you switched merchant account providers and can't always just relink your gateway to a different bank), you can still keep charging recurring payments to your customers without asking them for their payment info again.<p>- You can take the info with you if you decide, for some reason, to stop using Spreedly Core. And I trust they actually have the process in place for doing so, because it's coming from the Spreedly guys that have been doing this for a while already, not someone new.",1298442049

Cute =]<p>The issue you're going to find is that bandwidth doesn't get much cheaper than Amazon S3 unless you start going with hosting providers who are questionable. At $5/day with Amazon can we assume you're transferring around 30GB/day?<p>At this point a decidated hosting provider may be a better fit. For $40 a month you can get a dedicated box with Hetzner[1] that will allow you 2TB/month @ 100Mbit which then gets shaped to unlimited @ 10Mbit. 2000GB/31 days is basically 65 GB per day - more bandwidth than you need for the moment and at a cheaper rate than S3 can provide (2TB at Amazon S3 rates ($0.15/GB) is $300). If you can survive with lag from Germany this would be optimal.<p>The other (far nicer) option is to try and find a strategic partner. Someone like ICanHasCheezburger / FailBlog makes enough money from eyeballs that it may be worth their time to either provide you with money or bandwidth in exchange for a major link back to their page. Reach out to them, show them your page stats and see what sort of response you can get. They're already in a far more lucrative position as far as ad partners are concerned and can likely use your traffic to move into an even better bargaining position. They likely also have huge amounts of bandwidth spare as well which they may be more than happy to offer to you.<p>As another commenter said, $5/day won't kill you and I think you have quite a reasonable chance of making this back. Congrats on your success so far - if you ever come down to Sydney come along to SiliconBeach - I'd be interested to chat =]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/x2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/x2</a>",1298441881

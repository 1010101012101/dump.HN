The Nicaraguans I&#x27;ve spoken too think the project is all BS. However once you pay off enough locals, consider it more likely.<p>Big issue is that this will take 120 miles to cut, will they be able to recoup their investment if their fees to traverse are lower than panama, because they have to be to compete. Time crossing this canal has to be slower than panama&#x27;s 48 mile long canal. So assume 2.5x travel time, you have to charge lower fees because of the travel costs associated with the extra distance etc. time = fuel<p>Edit : See this recent article about wang jing <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/04/us-china-canal-insight-idUSBREA4309E20140504"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/04/us-china-canal-ins...</a>",1408255147

I would not, in fact, recommend ftfy there, and the README warns you against using it in that case.<p>There&#x27;s some auto-detection you can do -- for example, you can distinguish UTF-8 from byte-order-marked UTF-16 with 100% accuracy, by design. You could also try chardet if you&#x27;re okay with some amount of errors. Maybe show the detected encoding first.<p>Cases where ftfy is useful:<p>* Web scraping -- sometimes you get data that decodes in the encoding it claims to be in, but isn&#x27;t quite right<p>* Handling data that has, at one point, been imported and exported in Microsoft Office, without every user consistently picking exactly the right format from like 20 inaccurately-named options<p>* Handling data that was stored by half-assed services written in, say, PHP, and not tested outside of ASCII<p>* Reading CESU-8 (the non-standard encoding that Java and MySQL call &quot;UTF-8&quot;, for backward compatibility) in Python without breaking it even more. (This isn&#x27;t automatic.)<p>* Handling data that&#x27;s combined from multiple sources, in mixed encodings<p>* All the other situations in which mojibake arises in mostly-readable text, which there seem to be no end of.",1408253157

8188634,comment,8185021,8188602,6,0,pdonis,,,"Ok, so by this definition, Stalin was certainly not left-wing, since he exterminated and enslaved minorities, which you appear to agree is not supportive of social equality. Yet Stalin is used in the same Wikipedia article as an example of left-wing activities.<p>Also, if pacifism is left-wing, then the Obama administration is certainly not left-wing or anything close to it, since he has repeatedly authorized military action. I suppose you could finesse this point by saying that neither major party in the US is left-wing by your criterion. But trying to apply this more generally, for example to claim that Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, etc., were not &quot;really&quot; left-wing, looks a lot like a &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; argument.<p>In fact, by the pacifism criterion, I&#x27;m not aware of <i>any</i> government or political movement that has ever been left-wing; the closest thing to it would be some religious orders, like the Amish, who really do try to be pacifists. (Some people would put the Quakers in this category, but the Quakers have always flavored their surface pacifism with a strong pragmatic streak; they sold gunpowder to Washington&#x27;s army during the American Revolution, for example.) But this makes &quot;left-wing&quot; a basically useless term, not to mention that you would have to explain to an awful lot of people that they have been using it wrong for a long time, since most people apply the term to Stalin, as I noted above, as well as Mao, Pol Pot, etc.<p>Finally, if left-wing means supportive of social equality for everyone, then once again, there are hardly any true left-wingers and never have been. Take trade unions, for example: yes, they&#x27;re very supportive of social equality for their members, but are they equally supportive of social equality for management? Not to mention social equality for people who are not members but would like to learn one of the trades that are unionized? In my experience, unions do a very poor job with things like apprenticeship programs, because training new members means less job security for existing members.<p>Similarly, central planning in economics, which is supposed to promote more economic equality, ends up giving special privileges to the planners and those who are closely connected with them (like large financial institutions); witness the huge bailouts of investment banks after the crash of 2008, while ordinary people got foreclosed on. The closest thing to true left-wingers by this criterion are left-libertarians or anarchists (which, to be fair, the Wikipedia article does mention).",1408252694

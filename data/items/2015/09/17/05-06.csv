I wonder if that&#x27;s because bank-to-bank transfers are so quick and easy these days? Most of the big banks even have ways of sending _cash_ to other people, to withdraw from any of that bank&#x27;s ATMs with a code and no card.<p>Anyway, the issue Venmo has here is similar to what banks also have to deal with: in theory you can reverse a transaction before it&#x27;s cleared when sending money between accounts. That said, it&#x27;s quite a bit more difficult I&#x27;d assume, and perhaps a lot of people who would otherwise be happy with scamming those out of money on third-party systems would think twice about doing so when a bank is involved. Interesting stuff, and it seems most startups who try and break into these sorts of markets have to learn all the hard lessons the big companies did years ago, which sucks for consumers.

What anonymity does instead is probably the most important part of starting any movement that is mutually exclusive with &quot;acceptable&quot; political views.<p>When a political situation starts to work against the interested of the common person, most people tend to notice, at least in some small way. If nothing else, they notice some of the <i>harmful effects</i> that are starting to affect them. As they (greatly) outnumber the people &quot;in charge&quot;, they only need to use their strength in numbers (either politely with the vote/etc or violently with the pitchfork and molotov.<p>Unfortunately, this can be prevented by creating a situation where people <i>fear</i> retribution and <i>fear</i> that any action they take will not be successful. When you believe that not enough people would join you or that there is no way you to achieve that critical mass of people, <i>learned helplessness</i> sets in. It becomes &quot;obvious&quot; that &quot;fighting corruption is futile&quot;, when it really is as simple as everybody simply <i>trying</i>.<p>This is why the 1st Amendment has a right to <i>assembly</i>, and why &quot;free speech zones&quot; and other obvious abridgements of that right were important to fight. It&#x27;s also why a lot of people in power got <i>very, very scared</i> at the &quot;Occupy&quot; movement. People assembling so they can see first-hand that <i>they are not alone</i> in their views is one of the only ways to undo the learned helplessness. It is hard to argue with empirical evidence; seeing that you view is actually <i>popular</i> can start a revolution.<p>So what does this have to do with anonymity? It&#x27;s one of the best ways (and one of the only long-term successful ways, historically) to solve the &quot;first mover&quot; problem. A single anonymous statement that bluntly points out how <i>everybody knows</i> that the emperor isn&#x27;t wearing any clothes <i>gives permission</i>[1] to everybody else to also acknowledge this fact. Without the anonymity, it is extremely difficult to find people willing to fall on their sword.<p>Worse, lack of anonymity can be restated as the people in power knowing who is talking to each other (you can follow the flow of memes). This map of social organization allows for the targeting of people that <i>might</i> become such a focal point that rallies the masses. Cut off a few <i>potential</i> whistleblowers or <i>potential</i> leaders when they are inexperienced and &quot;testing the waters&quot; keeps the real problems from happening. The FBI used to call this &quot;COINTELPRO&quot;. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to decide if such tactics are still being used.<p>Your fundamental problem is that you&#x27;re assuming anonymity is some sort of shield against a government, while the real utility of anonymity is how it lets you acquire strength in numbers <i>to fight</i> that same government.<p>[1] For an interesting discussion on how language allows multiple levels of knowledge (&quot;(I think) she knows&quot; vs &quot;I know that she knows that I know that she knows&quot;), try this RSA Animate: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-son3EJTrU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-son3EJTrU</a>",1442468722

10231681,comment,10225903,10231153,0,0,smosher_,,,"> To me, green threads are just an implementation detail. The fact that green threading is being used shouldn&#x27;t leak into the interface.<p>I think that mentality, which I supported, may be what ruined green threads for Rust. Perhaps the enemy was the perfect of the good. On the other hand, maybe not having to worry about differences is the better benefit. <i>I</i> would rather be slower-but-acceptably-fast than have to think about 1:1 vs M:N threading in the case that they are not interchangeable.<p>On the third hand, it could be that Rust is too close to the metal for green threads to be of any significant benefit. If that&#x27;s the case, Rust ought to trounce all the M:N implementations, subject to reasonable limits on spawn rate, memory pressure and inter-thread communication. Does that sound right?<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;ve never seen a cooperative threading implementation that didn&#x27;t have a yield call of some kind available, and you can usually jam any of them up by writing an infinite computation-only loop, so even in the langauges where the scheduler is automatically invoked, correct 1:1 code can deadlock in the M:N scenario. State machines can too, but a trivial example, translated, might read something like the following:<p><pre><code>    for(;;);\n    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve seen code like this written by complete newbies, but threading constructs can hide that relationship even from experts. In parallel code it isn&#x27;t a sequential relationship, but it is with cooperative threads. I guess this is all fairly pedantic (such a minor detail, mostly affecting only poorly-written programs), but in the end, one of: yield(), sched(), sync(), etc. does show up in practically all of the cooperative threading interfaces.",1442466801

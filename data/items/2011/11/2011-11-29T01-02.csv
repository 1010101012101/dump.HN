But it is suspected that higher tensor powers may drop the exponent slightly.<p>I believe there are approaches related to other constructions in group theory, such as the wreath product, which may eventually lead to better results. It's just a huge unknown at this point. (My knowledge of these techniques can be written on the back of a postage stamp otherwise I'd try and provide more detail.)<p>One certainly hopes that higher and higher tensor powers are not the way to get omega = 2, as the algorithms just become more and more complex.<p>Someone may correct me if I am wrong but I think it is still not known even what the best algorithm is which breaks matrices up into 3x3 and whether one exists with better complexity than Strassen even (which breaks the matrix up into 2x2).

When the store manager was promoted out of the position, she was replaced by a more corporate type who had different hiring criteria.

Many graduate advisors spend so much time writing grant proposals and hobnobbing with government project managers that they didn't care what result their experiments got, as long as it was positive.  I lost interest in being a researcher primarily because it's no different than working at a company - except you get paid less.<p>I never saw any researchers or students falsify or make up data, but often I saw experiments performed without defining a hypothesis first.  The hypothesis was created a posteriori to match any interesting correlations that could be combed from the data.  I felt like I was a marketer trying to find a reason to promote a product.  This particular approach might be standard when dealing with in-vivo experiments (on human subjects).  It's a time-intensive process and you can't just rerun the experiment like you can on an artificial system.  However, I didn't feel like it was the correct way to do research.<p>There's been renewed interest in recent years of creating a journal of failed experiments for various research areas, but it never seems to catch on.  It would be invaluable, but there are too many egotistical people in academia who don't want to be associated with failure in any way.",1322530071

Not until he has y downloads will he have recouped his initial development costs and he will continue to earn money well past the mark of y downloads.<p>I think selling upgrades to apps would partially help, as it would encourage updates due to the possibility of recouping the costs from an existing customer base as well as allow the app to meet multiple points along a price/functionality curve.<p>They could release source code and sell it anyways. The problem there is that someone else could compile it and sell it on the app store to undercut him. I'm not sure what kind of recourse (if any) the developer would have in such a situation, thus I doubt releasing source is viable.<p>The rich benefactor idea is clearly in jest, since such arrangements are rare. Yet, corporations pay people to work on open source code. As long as the business can get their value out of a piece of software and it isn't core to their business model, there is very little reason why the code shouldn't be able to be open.<p>Regardless, I don't think the indie developer cares about software freedom, they just don't want to be pestered by free software advocates.

They used an algorithm A (which doesn't actually multiply matrices, but from which a matrix multiplication algorithm can be constructed) which yielded omega < 2.39. They noted in their own paper that if the second tensor power of algorithm A is used instead of A when constructing the matrix multiplication algorithm, they get the bound 2.376.<p>This paper analyses the 8th tensor power of the original <i>algorithm</i> A in what is really a tour-de-force and show that it leads to a better bound. So technically the algorithm (the eight tensor power of the original algorithm that CW used) was ""known"". The innovation here is showing that this is actually better for constructing a matrix multiplication algorithm than the original or second tensor power algorithms.<p>This paper is also of interest because it allows analysis of tensor powers of other algorithms. It's probably just the beginning of a slew of new records.<p>There is no question this is a landmark paper.

And while UI guidelines have always been enforced fairly rigidly on Apple's platform, the quality and consistency of icons, toolbars, etc. on windows applications have always been a good proxy for the reliability and utility of the underlying code. ANSI or command-line software has a strong design element; <i>Norton Utilities</i>, <i>Lotus 1-2-3</i> and <i>WordPerfect</i> were winners in their respective markets because they had robust visual grammars, and even a batch file or shell script needs some design to the extent that it's user-facing.<p>Recently I've been using a terminal to some ancient AS/400 database to look up property records at my local city hall, and it's an excellent reminder of how even the simplest task can become completely user-hostile if design is overlooked.",1322528700

3288459,comment,3287620,3288398,3,0,snoble,,,"Thanks wtvanhest<p>I think we basically agree; you may just be taking issue with my very explicit representation of the formula. All that's really happening here is just a weighted average of daily churn rates. I really think you need to average over a period of time to deal with normal volatility.<p>While the number '30' is in the formulation is not intended to mean that this metric can only be measured for a month. Rather it's just there to normalize the metric to always be comparable to the monthly rate. It would be very reasonable to take this metric for a month and for every week in the month and see if any of the weeks are substantially higher or lower.<p>I would be cautious with using this, or anything based on daily churn, to be used in a formula for predictions. If you want to predict what customers will do over x days it is far better to measure what customers have done over x days. What you lose in currency you more than make up for in having taken a direct measurement. Though I would happily use this metric to play in a model with computed weights.<p>Thanks again,
Steven",1322528645
3288458,comment,3284206,3287791,1,0,dbingham,,,"Fair.  Thank you for the correction.  But I think this is, personally, one of my problems with free market economics.  It conflates value and price too much.  If you make a piece of software, or music, or a book and cannot control it's being copied, then how can a market assign value to it?  The price is zero.  Period.  It's free.  Unless you can somehow prevent it from being copied.  And even with the restrictions of law, we've seen that that is nearly impossible.<p>The only reason price based markets even work for any other sort of exchange is because there is limited supply.  With anything digital the supply is inherently unlimited.",1322528630

Ever worked in a union shop, John?

It's a smaller town without much public transit. My wife's friend knows how to drive, but her boyfriend's car has a manual transmission. On a recent visit, the friend is complaining that her boyfriend won't teach her how to drive his car. Being proud of the fact that I (barely) know how to drive a stick, I volunteer to teach her. Her boyfriend doesn't object, so out to the car we go. I drive to a nearby empty parking lot and trade seats with my wife's friend.

I feel like this is true of the majority of people.  I, for one, know that when I was doing math in grade school I usually grasped the concept on the day it was introduced, yet was forced to repetitively solve quiz-like problems for weeks afterwards.  This only served to make me absolutely hate the idea of math.  And I don't believe my ability to understand the concepts was far beyond most of the others in my class.  In my classes at least, the pace of instruction was always slowed to the level of the slowest students.  I consider it a tragedy that most of my fellow students and I could've been hammering through calculus by eighth grade and instead were barely scratching the surface of algebra.",1322528512

Traditionally HN has given token upvotes to cynical quips, jokes, etc, but the bulk of upvotes have always gone to really insightful comments. It's one of the things I enjoy about this community.<p>With the karma removed from comments, though, ""witty joke with 7 upvotes"" is now completely indistinguishable at a glance from ""extreme insight with 100 upvotes"".<p>I don't think it's realistic to expect people to stop joking about topic X, or making short quips about things... logically it makes sense to bring back some kind of way to differentiate these posts.",1322528483

Myself, I went to college to study music and audio engineering, I discovered partying and living on my own and dropped out.  I got married.  I got divorced.  I lost all my possessions multiple times.  I've experienced addiction, depression, the whole nine yards.  I didn't discover programming until I turned 25.  I'm turning 32 next year, and I couldn't be happier with my life.  The whole thing has been a terrifying rollercoaster so far, and I'm not betting on it slowing down that much for a while.

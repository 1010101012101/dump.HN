Although, to be clear, I was not saying that there was <i>no</i> possibility as you&#x27;re now claiming.  And I&#x27;m not sure how your statement about the Black Death supports your argument.  As we all know, the Black Death passed.  It continues to pop up from time to time, but that&#x27;s true of almost any disease.<p>Perhaps a more convincing statistic would be that Ebola does not have a 100% mortality rate.  This would suggest that, technically, it will pass since there will be survivors.  Again, I think people are more concerned about how quickly that will happen and if/when it will resurface, which it probably will.",1413179979

8447660,comment,8446897,8447473,0,0,limpon,,,"Ebola is fairly difficult to spread, it is not very contagious, no matter what you might believe based on news reports.
If you want to look at a contagious disease, look at flu. The 2009 flu pandemic lead to hospitalization of ~200,000 people in the US alone within a few weeks [1]. Talking about the flu, you can somewhat guess the number of infected people to be much much higher. 
The current Ebola outbreak lead to ~8,000 infected persons since its outbreak more than half a year ago in March.
As you see, Ebola is not very contagious when compared to the flu. Yet flu pandemics are usually restricted fairly well once they take off and people are aware.<p>I&#x27;m constantly reading people being afraid of Ebola mutating to make people survive longer so the virus can spread better. Influenza (Flu) is very good with that, yet not even the very contagious flu was able to cause a significant thread to mankind in the recent history.<p>Ebola is the cause for a humanitarian crisis in West Africa and we should put all our efforts to helping the people who are affected by it, rather than worrying about ourselves for no good reason.<p>1) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic</a>",1413179928

8447646,comment,8447227,8447516,0,0,ak217,,,"Caltrain is not &quot;already pretty good&quot;. It has antiquated, overweight trains due to federal requirements and the fact that it shares track with freight traffic. Those trains can&#x27;t accelerate properly, so those &quot;convenient&quot; stops in each downtown mean the trains can&#x27;t run with enough frequency. There are not enough trains and too many at grade crossings, which produce severe noise pollution (due to the federal horn sounding requirements).<p>Caltrain is WAY overdue for upgrades. The electrification project, which will solve some but not all of these problems, is in need of a speedup. Many at grade crossings need to be replaced with bridges (and some are being replaced), but because of all the fiefdom-like towns along the way, getting anything done along the right-of-way is a nightmare.<p>Although there is no tractable way to merge Caltrain with BART (because of BART&#x27;s own foolish planning decisions, such as a custom gauge), and you&#x27;re right that there is no space for a second right-of-way, there is another neglected project that would benefit here: Dumbarton Rail (<a href=""http://www.bayrailalliance.org/dumbarton_rail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bayrailalliance.org/dumbarton_rail</a>).

8447629,comment,8444953,8446849,0,0,jongala,,,"The main thing that helps me is being interested in the technology itself.  The actual sport as it plays out is highly optimized/refined, as you say, but if you’re interested in what determines the performance envelope and how the different teams approach the problem of expanding it, then the whole thing takes on another dimension.  The teams design and build their cars themselves with a huge range of available resources, so there is a nice mix of scrappy ingenuity, dogged refinement and luck on display.<p>This, together with the huge budgets involved at the front of the grid, also produces a sport that features celebrity engineers who command multi-million-dollar salaries and have dramatic contract disputes, etc.  This may or may not appeal to you.<p>Crucially (for me), the teams are very secretive about what they are doing and why, so figuring out the mechanical and aerodynamic approaches that are in play, which ones are winning, which brilliant ideas are languishing on underfunded teams, etc. becomes a very interesting saga of nerdy armchair detective work.  Even the parts of the cars that they can’t hide — the bodywork — are sophisticated enough aerodynamically that you can’t necessarily tell what is going on (or copy it for your car) without a relatively detailed understanding of how it works within an overall aerodynamic philosophy.  There is a good and growing online community to get into with that.<p>Then you add the drivers; there are only a couple dozen to know about so its pretty accessible that way, and you get a sense as others here have said about who is under pressure, who has the talent but not the machinery and vice versa, and how they all interact.<p>Another interesting interaction is between drivers and cars, or driving styles and car characteristics — there are drivers that can uniquely exploit certain car characteristics, or cars that may be designed to suit certain drivers or styles, etc. and those will evolve as drivers move among teams and as the technical regulations change.<p>I realize typing this out that these things point more to enjoying <i>the sport</i> more than <i>the races</i> themselves.  I am a lot less fixated on watching the races than I used to be, but there are still some great moments and I catch what I can.  Today’s Russian GP was notably boring for the last couple of years, FWIW.  For more instant gratification Moto GP might be a better bet, and most of the technical drama unfolds over there too.

If they had these things, I would use BART probably a few times a week to go to SF from SJ. Right now, I drive instead (1x on average every other week) to night clubs / bars / dinner in SF / Berkeley. I can park at Millbrae and take BART into the city, but doing so is only useful if I&#x27;m going to be back before ~midnight.<p>Caltrain is not an option because the service isn&#x27;t 24x7, it&#x27;s terribly slow, the train doesn&#x27;t come often enough, and the station isn&#x27;t close to where I live. The last 2 are just personal annoyances, but I think the first 2 are enough to make it a much-less-desirable option vs driving for people who would otherwise take it. That the cars are ridiculously over-built because they technically share tracks with freight trains (from what I&#x27;ve read, this is also what makes them so horribly loud and inefficient [which also makes the system much more expensive to run]) and do lots of PR damage by having very loud horns (my speculation: is that also related to the shares-tracks-with-freight-trains thing?) are just rotten cherries on top.<p>Public transit isn&#x27;t easy, but it&#x27;s also not impossible.

There are ways to do certain things well, but this just seems like it would become boringly slow terribly fast.<p>With wearables such as watches, we need to think of different ways to input text and interact with content on the screen and with other people using similar devices. The future of text input is not swiping at letters on a screen because it&#x27;s a cumbersome hack that misses the point of wearables altogether.<p>Wearables are for fundamentally different types of communication than phones are. Obviously I&#x27;ll get flamed for this but I think Apple is the only company thus far to have realized that. People are not going to want to be manually texting others from their watch.

Watches are going to be for informal communication, like quickly sending pictures, emoticons, or heuristically generated predictive text snippets.<p>This is cool and all but they go into this project with the assumption that manual text input on small devices is important, which to me at least, it&#x27;s pretty clearly not.",1413177234

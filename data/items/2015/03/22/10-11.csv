Think of the safe space as the live-action version of the better-known trigger warning, a notice put on top of a syllabus or an assigned reading to alert students to the presence of potentially disturbing material.<p>The Church of Scientology had to create itself some safe spaces in order that its practitioners could feel comfortable learning new things in spite of the rampant counter-opinions on the subject of the mind, body and soul.<p>Does the idea that colleges and other social institutions need a safe space, away from all the &#x27;counter-opinions&#x27; offend you?  Maybe you should stop reading right now.<p>Unless daily protected from doing so, every safe space eventually becomes a prison.  No institution is safe from authoritarian behaviour - even those who fight repression/oppression/suppression.  In fact, it is a daily struggle to prevent these very human elements from impacting society - because fundamentally there is a desire in all of us, every single one of us - enlightened or otherwise - to repress those we do not agree with, suppress those we despise for whatever reason, and hate those for whom we cannot find anything to love about.",1427021944

9246294,comment,9244283,9245977,0,0,asgard1024,,,"> Indeed, it&#x27;s actually more poignant that the tyranny is both ephemeral and, more importantly, inevitable. This is the real issue. It&#x27;s easy to comprehend the issue by looking at semi-permanent states [1], like Marxist class divisions or political polarization, but those are consequences.<p>I disagree; if the oppression is ephemeral, then it&#x27;s nowhere as bad as when it is (semi)permanent. (Maybe an example would help - all the oppressions that come to my mind from history, that were formalized in law, are attempts to permanently subjugate or even eradicate the minority.)<p>(In fact, I can come up with an example of &quot;ephemeral&quot; oppression - unemployment. It&#x27;s irony that people who argue that democracy leads to tyranny of majority often fail to see the tyranny of the markets.)<p>People do have empathy and memory; if you being in the minority is ephemeral, then you will remember it and vote differently. Oppression can only work if people are afraid; if they are not, they can change things and work toward consensus.<p>And if you look at direct democracy in Switzerland, for instance, you will find that direct democracy (I don&#x27;t consider representative democracy only one or the best possibility) actually leads to more consensual result - people vote differently on different issues, sometimes they have minority view, mostly they have majority view (as it happens statistically), and because of that, the party or class tribalism you describe from American politics is greatly reduced. So empirically, exact opposite happens than what &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; crowd tends to think that happens. (Another counterfactual claim is that direct democracy will lead to some torrent of crazy changes - in fact common voters are more conservative and less decisive than politicians.)<p>> This is a problem. It is the exact opposite of what you need to make sure that a majority is an emergent majority.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what is your point here. In direct democracy, the majority is always emergent; it depends on your actual views, not on which party you decide to vote for.",1427020635

At least in Denmark it&#x27;s administered in a considerably different manner, more like any other public spending that decides on priorities and allocates resources. Some parts of it do have actuarial elements that parallel what an insurance company would do (pooling risks across the population), but many don&#x27;t. The cost of many things is well known in advance and has little uncertainty (especially when the whole country is taken in aggregate), and it&#x27;s just a public-health choice whether to pay for it or not. Routine childhood vaccinations are a clear example, which are just budgeted as a public-health measure, like water purification or whatever. Hospitals have an element of risk-pooling when individual patients are looked at, but at the public level are run more like fire departments or police departments, which also have an element of risk pooling. I guess you could argue that fire departments are really some kind of state-administered fire-response-insurance system, but I&#x27;m not aware of that being a common approach. Data and statistics and people to look at them are still needed though, of course, but they are looking at more &quot;real&quot; problems, like which procedures best improve morbidity-adjusted life expectancy.<p>I know in some other countries, like Germany, it is set up much more closely to insurance, in the sense that procedures have prices, are billed out to patients, who are covered by insurance plans that reimburse patients for costs, etc., in which case I imagine the bureaucracy is much more insurance-like.",1427018749

If we are to play the game that a business can only succeed if people are mindlessly, constantly, repetitively consuming its products, then we should be beating down the doors of, say, Redbox. After all, their business model works best if everyone sat on their asses all day doing nothing but watch movies.<p>I do not see the argument at all that McDonald's business <i>hinges</i> on the abusively high consumption of their foods.

Convenience and price obviously play big roles here, but they are also likely choosing McDonalds over other options on at least some basis of taste.<p>> But make no mistake that McDonalds is a business that is, if not as harmful as Philip Morris, gradable on the same scale. For the most part it's a company whose core business model is ""leverage unfathomably vast marketing resources to coerce large numbers of people into making the least healthful dietary choice available to them at any given moment"".<p>In Australia, they actually [no doubt due to social pressures] a large range of ""healthy options"" that are actually half-decent. I'm not sure whether they offer this stuff in the US, but compared to the numerous fried chicken, roast chicken and Burger King restaurants here, they are leagues ahead.<p>Note that I'm not defending their past behaviour-which I think we can agree was abysmal-but they have at least tried to reform and for a business of their size and brand, is no easy feat.",1340243749

4140076,comment,4139590,4139969,3,0,sophacles,,,"Actually, when placing a piece in greater context, mentioning the source and the tendencies of a source, is not an ad hominem fallacy. (It is ad hominem, just not fallaciously so).<p>A part I noted in the article that is subtly trying to conflate two things, is that privacy guards are injected as a first amendment violation, in an article over the absurdity of computers being an independent actor in free speech. They may be related topics, but suggesting privacy protections are silly because they are obviously first amendment issues akin to computer speech is a bit questionable. Further the article presents some strawman arguments with regard to that particular issue - for instance the issue of hand compilation suddenly being ok for everyone worried about computer speech wrt privacy: well no, that particular issue has been hashed out many times in pre-computer eras, with things like city directories and telephone books.<p>Second, just because someone criticizes the left and the right both, does not matter when characterizing the things a particular organization cares to publish, particularly when that statement doesn't support the characterization of the group as a right leaning group. Plenty of ""liberal"" groups criticize the left, even though no one would disagree they are liberal (e.g. socialist groups regularly attack the democrats for not doing enough, bowing to centrism, whatever).<p>Finally, it was worth mentioning in that without such a warning about strong political leanings, one may not be inclined to be on the lookout for the above mentioned types of issue conflation. A warning about this is fair, whether you agree or disagree with the conclusion, it doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention for it and understand implicit biases in a piece.",1340243118

4140049,comment,4139232,4139761,2,0,JoshTriplett,,,"I did read and fully understand your comment, and no, I don't think you've addressed the point in my comment.  However, I do agree you've suggested a subtler issue than the one usually discussed in this context, and since my comment used terms like ""scarcity"" and ""infinitely copyable"", I may have come across as endorsing a much more simplistic argument than I intended to make.<p>You described the idea of taking a physical item and paying only the manufacturing cost of that item, and I'd assume you intended that to define copying a file as taking it and ""paying"" the copying cost of 0.<p>However, those two actions still have a fundamental difference, and not one of price.  Assuming a price (zero or otherwise) also assumes a particular entity owed that price; the analogy you made assumes a price inherently owed to the original author of some piece of data, and that copying the file amounted to refusing that price and choosing to pay 0 instead.  When I disagreed with that analogy, I didn't intend to imply that the zero cost of copying data provides a justification; rather, I disagreed with the implicit assumption of inherently owing any particular price to the author (zero or otherwise).<p>To elaborate on that distinction: if I want to copy a chair, I can look at it, perform measurements of it, perhaps perform some materials analysis, and given sufficient skill I can make a copy of it, all without affecting the original.  I argue that I have the inherent right to perform that process.  That process will almost certainly entail some cost to me: for instance, I'll have to purchase materials to build the copy.  However, I don't inherently owe any price to the original designer or builder of the chair, beyond what I might have originally paid them to obtain the original chair.  I'd consider the copying of a chair in this manner exactly analogous to the copying of a digital file in all relevant respects.  As it turns out, copying digital files requires no particular measurements, materials analysis, or skill, and costs effectively nothing; however, that particular detail doesn't matter for the question we've both asked, namely ""does the copier inherently owe anything to the author"".  And if we build a system to automatically analyze the chair and print a new one on a 3D printer, and can thus copy a chair at minimal expense, that doesn't affect the key question either.<p>Bringing that back in the direction of copyright, the same thing applies to the copying of a physical book: that process typically involves a non-zero cost, in some combination of time, wear on equipment (copier, scanner, etc), and possibly materials (if copying onto paper), but the conclusion remains the same.<p>And to go in a different direction: if I hear a song, and later sing it myself, I've copied it (lossily) with my brain and vocal cords, at zero cost to me and zero inherent price owed to the singer or author of the song.  We've had infinitely copyable goods long before we had computers.<p>If you take a bag of M&Ms and pay less than the cost, the proprietor of those M&Ms no longer has them, and cannot then choose to do with them as they see fit; I'll assume from your use of that analogy that you already agree that such an action violates basic expectations of property rights, and that the proprietor of the M&Ms can choose to demand any particular price or none at all.  I agree with you completely there: you don't have the inherent right to steal a bag of M&Ms because you find the price not to your liking.  However, I hope I've made it sufficiently clear why I don't find that situation analogous to copying a file, or to copying a chair, or a book, or a collection of sound waves.<p>However, your analogy does actually suggest a rather clear approach to handling trade secrets, or (as brought up by another reply to my comment) private information.  If someone chooses not to distribute certain information at all, then taking it from them against their will does not seem reasonable to me.  For instance, if someone breaks into my personal system, copies my passwords or encryption keys, and distributes them to the world, I don't consider that reasonable, despite the copying occurring at zero cost; <i>that</i> situation seems quite analogous to the one you described.<p>That seems like an entirely different situation from the one more commonly addressed by copyright, namely the original author choosing to distribute information and then attempting to control the subsequent distribution of that information by others.  I'd argue that the author has every right to choose what to do with the information they have, including not distributing it at all; however, if they choose to distribute that information to others, I'd also argue that those others have every right to choose what to do with the information <i>they</i> have, including distributing it further.<p>Hopefully I've managed to make it clear that my comment came from a position of careful thought, not from a pattern-matched knee-jerk reaction. :)",1340242328

4140045,comment,4136752,4137213,2,0,ScottBurson,,,"I see both sides of this argument.  The OP -- at least in this blog post; I haven't read the paper -- spends most of his time talking about how he's demonstrated the insufficiency of unit testing.  For the purpose of that argument, it really doesn't matter that he used Haskell as opposed to some other type checker.<p>It's only in the last two sentences of his ""Conclusion"" section that he turns the argument around, and here is where he oversteps:<p><i>While unit testing does catch many errors it is difficult to construct unit tests that will detect the kinds of defects that would be programatically detected by static typing. The application of static type checking to many programs written in dynamically typed programming languages would catch many defects that were not detected with unit testing[...]</i><p>Clearly, this is overbroad.  For starters, he should have used ""could"" in place of ""would"".  And it wouldn't have been a bad time to remind the reader that Haskell's type system differs from those of other statically typed languages with which the reader may be more familiar.<p>I don't quite agree, though, that the conclusion is ""trivial"".  Maybe I'm just out of touch, but I wasn't aware of a good test of how true the dynamic argument was in practice, as opposed to theory -- particularly claim #2.",1340242243

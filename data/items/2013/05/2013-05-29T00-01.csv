It's much easier to review the patches via e-mail, and everyone on the development community can make suggestions.   Even so, it's not uncommon for patches to require three or four versions, and not just by first-time contributors.  There are patches written by folks who have been working on ext4 for many years which still require three or four or more revisions after being subjected to multiple rounds of peer review.<p>If you show me a git project where most of the pull requests are accepted, I'll show you a git project whose quality assurance is probably completely out of control.",1369789177

Quite the contrary, in fact. Far too many objects that do way to much, or functions that do X and Y.<p>Indeed, I'm puzzled by your statement:<p>> Yes, its good to have short, readable, meaningful methods. Reducing method size too much...<p>Which directly contracts this:<p>> If you follow Martins advice<p>I guess the key word is 'enough', which is really just bad wording.  ""If you don't follow Martin's advice"" is better.  The qualifier here is you don't make short methods for the sake of having short methods.  You make methods as short as they need to be to do that thing they promise to do.<p>So then we come to it: either you support having your methods do more than they should, doing more than one thing and having side effects, or you support Martin's suggestions.  And yes, it really is that black and white.  Sure, you could suggest that following his advice ""enough"" leads you to nothing but one line methods, but that would be silly.",1369789085

I assume the legal clarity it provides is seen as worthy of the extra hurdle to some of the more risky and/or cautious projects.

Originally a sheet was like an excel sheet, each one would do something different or track a different location, etc.<p>After going through a bunch of iterations on the copy, I just started referring to the product as a sheet, as in ""inventory sheet"". I agree 100% that this is confusing and needs to change.<p>3) One of the first things I'm going to do for rebuilding this app is charge far more. Businesses that scoff at paying more than $29 per month are probably not the kind of business that should be using the product.<p>4) I've tried a bunch of different designs and copy for the landing page, including a bunch of screenshots at one time. One big problem I've had is my failure to accurately track what was a success and what wasn't. What you see there is my last attempt before losing interest in the product. (I was going for ""hybrid copy"" for those of you that read CopyHackers).<p>5) In my latest iteration on the home page and other parts of the site I tried to go for a more ""personal"" approach instead of ""corporate-y"" like my competitors. Like the point above says, though, I have failed to accurately track what works and what doesn't beyond saying this iteration has been my most successful at getting trials.<p>All in all, great advice.

A man musing on objects  develops attachment for them, from attachment arises desire, from desire arises anger.[1]<p>63. From anger arises delusion, from delusion confusion of memory, from confusion of memory loss of intellect, from loss of intellect he perishes.[1]<p>There is a simple but powerful metaphysical system underlying these verses and I apologise to the uninitiated reader, but would be happy to briefly outline this system should anyone wish it so.<p>While I will avoid vague (undefined between myself and the reader) terms such as 'natural' or 'intuitive' thinking, readers who accept that the intellect is that which conceives solutions will also be able to entertain the possibility that by improving/strengthening the intellect we improve our ability to solve the problems that face us.<p>This improving of the intellect is the meta-solution to all problems, and (caution: opinion) it should be a requirement for all human beings that they develop this faculty (as the only known living beings with access to higher reasoning faculties). Failing such, you are not living up to the name 'human'. Perhaps this is a hardline stance.<p>Education (formal) fails us here. We are provided with material to think with and about, but scarcely are we conducted through the arenas of thought by those who have made it further than we. Instead, education seems to be a way to simply 'make a living' by learning a skill and applying it in exchange for money.[2] A noteworthy read on this is the Cardinal JH Newman's thoughts on how British universities in the early 1900's were moving away from pure 'intellectual' development and became more utilitarian. A brilliant intellect allowing us access to his thoughts.[3] Suffice to say, things have worsened much since then.<p>[1] From ""The Bhagavad Gita"" by A Parthasarathy. As an aside, I cannot recommend his book ""The Fall of the Human Intellect"" enough.<p>[2] I'm making a generalisation here. If you happened to have someone teach you who opened up your mind, you're one of the lucky few in the world.<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.newmanreader.org/works/idea/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newmanreader.org/works/idea/</a>",1369787360

If youre developing in a dynamically typed OO language like Ruby, its almost always <i>bad</i> advice to follow <i>Clean Code</i>. There are performance considerations even with Java to following some of the advice given. With Objective C, the suggestions are just silly. With languages that emphasize some level of functional programming (including Ruby and even C# to a degree), the suggestions are counter-productive and produce code that is unnecessarily obfuscatory.<p>Yes, its good to have short, readable, meaningful methods. Reducing method size too much, though, can result in code that you have to follow through many objects in order to understand the logic. If you follow Martins advice enough, you will end up with lots of very short methods on lots of very small objectsand have a hard time understanding just how your program fits together.<p>If Martin were a better writer, or had expanded his horizons beyond Java when he had written this book, he may have written something profoundstill dangerous, but profound. Instead, he wrote <i>Clean Java</i> and either he or his publisher thought it would sell more as <i>Clean Code</i>. My advice is to ignore the bookunless Martin comes out with a second edition that takes what he has learned in the last few years since leaving behind Java and applies it to <i>really</i> make a book that describes clean code.",1369787085

5783694,comment,5782761,5783567,1,0,tmzt,,,"Yeah, books might be a good niche for a product like this. There is a market for software targeting people selling through Amazon who really need just inventory management and not customer lists and the other features mentioned in the original article.
The custom barcode scan stuff is spot on, it would be interesting to have a Android or iPhone application that integrates potentially in real-time with a web app (look at the Roller demo that Google just released to see how simple integration can be) and is used as a barcode scanner. Supporting ISBN, QR, other custom barcode formats could be a valuable feature.",1369785810

I built it to solve inventory management for small businesses, but small business inventory does not interest me any longer (if it ever did).<p>I find it hard to open the project in my IDE and work on it, or even to think about it at all.<p>With that said, however, I haven't given up on the problem I built it to solve (inventory management). Instead I've given up on who it was built for (small businesses).<p>I'd like to give more details about that but for now I'd rather build a plan of action before talking about what I'm going to do.<p>On another note, I completely agree that four months is far too short to call anything a success or a failure.

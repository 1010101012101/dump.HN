In other words, monopolistic behavior is fine as long as it's open source. I don't agree with that.<p>Also ""Works best in Chrome"" is hardly a self-inflicted wound.

Vendors should feel free to experiment.  The W3C should focus more on quickly standardizing things that are already working in the field.<p>Today, experimental and prefixed features used in the wild are creating real problems for interoperability and competition.  But I don't think there's a villain here, and I'm not blaming WebKit.  Both the browser vendors and the W3C are using processes that were designed to certain solve problems.  Now those processes are creating new problems and might need to change in response.<p>But, to answer your direct question (although I think this is getting on a tangent from the original post):<p>> <i>""What are the things Webkit has ""proposed"" by releasing builds that you don't think should be part of the web platform?""</i><p>Dart is an example of something that <i>Google</i> has proposed (not ""WebKit"" as a group) that I and many others - even others like Oliver Hunt within the WebKit community - do not think benefits the web platform.  Some people would put Web SQL Database in this category; I don't have an informed opinion about that one.  (Though I do know it's the reasons some versions of Gmail wouldn't even load in mobile Firefox.)<p>> <i>""Where did Webkit actually get things wrong?""</i><p>Apple's ""meta viewport"" tag is something that they released in Safari and evangelized to developers without specifying it or getting community feedback.  I had the pleasure of reverse-engineering it for Gecko.  Among other things, it's not even implemented in a layer where it makes sense.  (It should be part of style, not markup.)  Apple never proposed it as a standard; other people eventually did and are trying to fix some of the problems.  Unfortunately, the basic design is locked in by legacy content (and has been since soon after Apple shipped this feature in the first release of mobile Safari).<p>But frankly, I don't care so much whether they get things ""right"" or ""wrong.""  As bad as meta-viewport is, at least Firefox and Opera and Android and IE can implement support for it without controversy, and be compatible with sites that use it.  The way that prefixed CSS properties are (a) released to market by browser vendors, (b) evangelized to web developers, and (c) deployed on production web sites is creating a situation where new browsers are either locked out of existing sites <i>or</i> have to implement each others' prefixes.

The content industry derives both the 2nd and 3rd part of that argument from the law. They do not own something just because they say so. Nor is copying the equivalent of stealing just because they say so. They are basing their moral arguments purely on the law, which <i>defines</i> ownership and theft.<p>So when they tell the public, ""It's stealing!"", that's nothing but marketing.

3578206,comment,3577562,3577837,6,0,azakai,,,"> The browser vendors are doing exactly what they're supposed to do: come up with new things. If the W3C was doing its job, it would watch those new things carefully and, when enough momentum existed, start ratifying them as standards.<p>Both the browser vendors and the W3C could be doing a better job. But neither is really the problem here.<p>The problem is that WebKit, a single implementation, is utterly dominant in the mobile space (except for Opera on low-end phones in the far east). This isn't a criticism of WebKit. Any single implementation that becomes so dominant is bad.<p>Any single implementation, once it has vendor prefixed stuff in release builds, will lead to the problems the mobile web has now: People will use the vendor prefixes, after which that implementation can't remove them without breaking websites. And after that, other vendors will be forced to implement those prefixes in order to render the web in a non-broken way.<p>One way to avoid that is for vendors to not vendor prefix at all in release builds, but all browsers do that. If that is out, the only thing that can save us is for no single implementation to become dominant. But WebKit won on mobile - Android and iOS are by far the leaders, and both use WebKit; in fact, even most of the runners up do (Blackberry, Bada, WebOS, etc.).<p>My only criticism of WebKit is that, when it saw itself becoming so dominant, it should have been much more careful with vendor prefixing, preferably stopping doing so entirely in release builds. It's ok to vendor prefix when you have a competitive market, but if you do so when you are dominant or about to be, you end up with the current debacle.",1328922216

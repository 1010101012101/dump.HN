There's not exactly a plethora of mature web frameworks available. Rails and Merb seemed to be the most firmly established frameworks with a few others like Sinatra, Camping and Ramaze sprouting up.<p>I think the too much choice problem applies much more when you're installing a Linux distribution and you have to choose from 40 different text editors or IM clients. Who has the time or the inclination to evaluate each one?",1230065992

A little strange. The idea of only having 4 links per user is a good solution to the quotas imposed by Google App Engine, on which you are hosting this project but, from the user's perspective, this does not make the site very useful. It's your first Django project, so congrats on getting it up and running. Now, maybe you can add a Firefox toolbar or any number of other features that existing bookmarking services offer. Also, consider allowing users to have public and private bookmarks with tagging so that there is some interaction among the users on the site. Take a look at StumbleUpon as probably the most effective implementation of this type of service. You can learn a lot from their feature set. Then you need to think about how you can set yourself apart. Nice start, though.",1230065668

Determining how much depth will be provided and how/when to aggregate is really important. I'm not advocating premature optimization, but this stuff requires a lot of structural consideration.<p>The biggest hangup I've come across is filtering data by things like location/browser, and similar, as they would require aggregating data in many permutations...at least, as far as I've found.

408081,comment,407856,407856,0,0,russell,,,"Continuations are really neat devices.  You can make any kind of flow-of -control construct out of them.  IIRC they were originally invented to formally model the GOTO.  However, in their full glory they are mind numbingly difficult to understand and probably to debug.  Basically in the Swarms model you are passing around a chunk of program state to do the computation, and with it, all the problems that data encapsulation is supposed to solve. I thing debugging would be hugely difficult.  Contrast this with message passing where only the relevant values are sent, not the whole computational state.<p>The article says that 3.5% of instructions cause a continuation to be sent.  That's a huge percentage.  A program would spend all its time marshaling and unmarshaling.<p>One of the things that you want to do to increase efficiency is to promote and exploit locality.  You want to cluster the closely related objects on the same node to  reduce network traffic and latency.  Constant moving of objects or a bad distribution strategy is going to hurt that.  I once worked on a distributed database with automatic replication to ransom nodes.  Performance was killed by constant network chatter.

This is because the visual stimuli did get passed to the extrastriate visual cortical areas but not to the primary visual cortex.<p>So this perfectly fits Dennett's model: a signal becomes famous enough to control muscles, but, because of injury, does not become so famous (or so globalized a thread, in programming terms) that the subject is able to report an experience of it.<p>For my money, qualia does not exist. It is a remnant of Cartesian dualism that has no place in the 21st century.

This meant that virtually the entire community was behind Rails when it came to web app development - unlike some other languages, which have several frameworks competing for the crown. But Merb has recently started to give Rails a run for its money. Fortunately, the learning curve between Merb and Rails is relatively small.<p>So on the one hand, it's great that the Ruby community won't splinter between two competing frameworks.<p>But on the other hand, Merb was really creative and innovative, and I'd hate to see that innovation slow down as it becomes the Establishment.",1230063362

When I read the excerpt about it, I rolled my eyes and thought Ferris was full of it, claiming to be a national kickboxing champion. After reading the account, however, I have to admit it was a good hack. Throw people out of the ring. There isn't much way for the judges to cheat on that either, heheheh.<p>Ferris recently got a new TV show on History Channel, airing as a pilot. It is called ""Trial By Fire"", where he attempts to learn skills that normally takes 10 - 20 years to master and learn them in about 5 days. The show is interesting to see how the strategizing works. I have no idea if there are going to be more made, but if they were, Ferris promised showing skills like car racing.<p>Of course it is probably a way to get all of the stunts he wants to learn financed by a TV Network, but that's the point. What he wants to do isn't necessarily what I want to do, and applying the skills of hacking to life is a good thing.",1230062734

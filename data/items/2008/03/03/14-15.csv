After reading the headline and first opening you might be surprised to also know...<p>Mr. Wozniak carries an iPhone everywhere, but also carries several other phones for different purposes. (Including a razr for its 3G.)<p>He likes the design of the air and sounds like he lusts for it but wants to be able to burn DVDs anytime anywhere and have multiple batteries in case he is caught on a plane without a power source.<p>A more complete article is <a href=""http://www.macworld.com.au/blogs/view/macbook-air-won-t-be-a-hit-steve-wozniak-286"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macworld.com.au/blogs/view/macbook-air-won-t-be-a...</a><p>In the realm of the unrelated... I wonder if there will be an external battery market for the air? Back in the early 90s you could get batteries that were the footprint of your computer and about 3/4"" thick to stack your computer on and extend the life. Lead acid, ah... those were the days. Today I would think a nice lithium job, sort of log shaped with a padded groove on the top might be a winner. Leave it in the bottom of your bag to serve as ballast and the all important edge protector. Pull out a power cord from the bag when you need to plug in the laptop. Charge the bag overnight. (Guess at number without looking up data...) 4lbs of battery device might give you 15 hours of extra runtime.",1204556346

I also work full time doing hardware design and firmware mostly.\nThe problem with a lot of hardware is the initial investment and that things take longer. If you are just hacking some simple hareware together like a microcontroller and nothing special its easy to proto, but if you get into things that need to be prototyped on PCBs the cost and time goes up, especially the time factor. \nI tend to enjoy software more these days simply because I can compile things and test them right away. It can get onerous when you spend days laying out circuit boards, a week or two to spin them, then 2 weeks to get them built, while you just spent about 10k for 50 prototypes.",1204555955

When you factor in natural ad-aversion, it raises the the bar for success to a number you will be unlikely to achieve without a mainstream site.<p>That said, job ads are a very cool approach. They pay more and in-the-know managers are willing to pay a premium for elite developers.",1204555704

128071,comment,127711,128013,0,0,boredguy8,,,"""And I guarantee that none of these hundreds of thousands of exceptional cases ever had a parent that read some special book. Perhaps there is a pattern to how they were raised. If so, that empirical data is long lost to history.""<p>While I agree that you should read ""with a pinch of salt"", that's true for anything you read. But the sentiment that you oughtn't read anything is a bit overstated, it seems. Why?<p>One would (theoretically) avoid engaging a massive project without understanding the fundamentals of project design / development. Nor ought we, say, start a home renovation project without understanding the basics of construction. While one could certainly _end up_ successfully completing one's objectives, there's a hefty 'dumb tax' to be paid without learning from the mistakes of others.<p>Child rearing is no different. We don't magically know how to raise children. Some of us are lucky in having had good models in our parents. But even in that instance, a broader basis of knowledge is helpful because your children aren't your parent's children.<p>Certainly one can go overboard. And certainly some parents latch on to cargo cult science as if it were holy writ. But one can also go too far in the other direction and not read anything.",1204555236

128062,comment,127985,128026,0,0,brlewis,,,"I have a great firmware idea I'd like to see implemented.<p>We bought a digital photo frame last week.  Normally it sits horizontally.  Horizontal photos fill the frame, but vertical photos are squeezed to fit.  It detects when you turn it on its side, so that vertical photos fill the frame and horizontal photos are squeezed to fit.<p>Squeezed photos are too tiny, so I added horizontal-only and vertical-only Media RSS feeds to ourdoings.com, the world's best photo-sharing site.  When we change the orientation of the frame we change the RSS feed.<p>This works great for my wife and me, but it takes some button pressing to change RSS feeds.  Too much button pressing for non-technical people, I think.<p>If you hacked the firmware so that it switched back and forth automatically according to the orientation sensor, that would be really cool.  People could set up a frame, send it to relatives as a gift, and the relatives could just plug it in and watch it go.<p><a href=""http://ourdoings.com/2008-03-01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ourdoings.com/2008-03-01</a>",1204553994

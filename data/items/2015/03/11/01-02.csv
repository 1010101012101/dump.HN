Clearly SQL as the language the primary way most people interact with relational database.<p>In my my mind SQL as a language is a huge PITA. First, parsing of complex statements is expensive (there&#x27;s workloads where SQL parsing takes more time then processing the results).<p>Second, as SQL exists today (SQL2011) it&#x27;s a large, complex language that&#x27;s not implemented uniformly. So I understand why people want to build programmable interfaces for generating queries versus writing giant string statements that expand to SQL.<p>I personally would wish that there was an alternative language for interacting with relational databases that isn&#x27;t SQL. Just expose the whole relational expression tree to users say ala S expressions. It&#x27;s not like the relational engine is going to optimize / re-order it anyways.<p>I mean something along the lines of:<p><pre><code>  [ GROUP_AGGREGATE,\n    [ &quot;name&quot; ],\n    [ [ SUM, &quot;COUNT(*)&quot; ],\n      [ SUM, &quot;cost&quot; ]],\n    [ JOIN, [ ==, &quot;user_id&quot;, &quot;customer_id&quot;],\n      [ FILTER, [\n         [ &&, \n           [ >=, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;30&quot; ],\n           [ IN, &quot;state&quot;, &quot;NY&quot;, &quot;CT&quot;, &quot;NJ&quot;]],\n         [ TABLE, &quot;customer&quot; ]\n      [ TABLE, &quot;orders&quot; ]]]]]\n</code></pre>\nIs it more verbose, yes.

I understand your objection to be that we don&#x27;t want the registrar to be in the chain of trust; but they already are. If you can forge the target&#x27;s DNS records from the registrar&#x27;s servers then you can get a domain validated certificate from <i>any</i> CA.

The transaction to open the door gets signed only if that policy is met at each of the m signatures. You might have a lock device signature, a home signature, and a home owner signature. There are lots of microtransactions in IoT (good and potentially bad). Smart contracts can mitigate / isolate risk and ultimately reduce attack surface vulnerabilities.

I think that what you mean that is that doing a startup in general is biased against people with kids/families. I agree, but that is mostly because living on a smaller budget with kids is harder. The beautiful thing of a startup is that in most cases you work really hard and at the same take breaks in moments where it is important to be there for your kids. YC is structured in a way where during those three months you kind of take a break with your regular life and focus relentlessly on your company, but I believe that doing that is one of the most brilliant things from YC, it makes all the difference in the world for your chances of success.",1426036504

However, if challenged, most of those people don&#x27;t really know <i>why</i> they believe that. They have never personally seen any hard evidence that The Best Way is actually better than known alternatives. They have never spent significant time trying those alternatives for themselves to gain first-hand experience of the pros and cons.

But if you think I&#x27;m entirely kidding, just spend a few minutes with Google and see how much advocacy there has been for each of those ideas in their day and how much <i>actual data</i> there has ever been to justify that advocacy. And really I&#x27;m being kind here, because you talked about things that are supposedly &quot;faster, easier and more responsive to business requirements&quot; and I didn&#x27;t even mention words like &quot;agile&quot; or &quot;craftsmanship&quot; in my list.<p><i>If you don&#x27;t embrace change in the IT industry then get out.

I&#x27;m not trying to prove something (my original statement was ambiguous enough I think to defy proof). Rather I&#x27;m trying to nudge the discussion a bit toward a path which I personally think will be more successful overall.<p>The extensive back-and-forth downthread between me and @camgunz I think illustrates the difficulty in having these conversations. Till this very story I&#x27;ve always avoided these discussions for fear of being unfairly characterized, or cast as somehow supporting harassment (e.g. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9171403"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9171403</a>)<p>My whole point is I don&#x27;t want to dismiss anyone, least of all 50% of the population! I am curious about better ways to recruit a much larger percentage of the population in actively working against harassment. Part of recruitment is making everyone think there&#x27;s something <i>they personally</i> could gain from participating. E.g. this isn&#x27;t about making the world a better place for women, this is about making the world a better place, period.<p>Part of it is also dampening some of the overreach (like the idea you can&#x27;t pay an honest complement to a female coworker). Everyone should strongly condemn harassment, but I think many people also have a vehement reaction to anything that smells like prior restraint of personal freedoms, and unfortunately sometimes zealous attempts to &quot;protect&quot; women can feel, indeed are, too much of the later.<p>I think it&#x27;s really important to mediate against this, and some strategies I&#x27;ve adopted; make sure we&#x27;re not casting this as men vs women, to cut out the man bashing (because most men are awesome husbands, fathers, and coworkers), and perhaps the hardest, trust men enough to not feel like we have to restrain them, but rather recruit them to help battle harassment.<p>Such a complex and delicate topic, so rife for misunderstanding and personal attacks....

Since you are more likely to get funding, you can actually pay yourself at least enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry if you will be able to make rent. There is advantages to it also. When you have kids you are more aware of the consequences of failing, you value your time more and are less likely to &quot;play house&quot; as PG calls it, in my opinion. We didn&#x27;t move the family to the US because kids where in school and because they have a better support network in Portugal (granparents, aunts, etc). Regarding the financial success, it depends on whether you care about valuations at this stage which are fairly subjective. In terms of valuation it most certainly did, and since I own stock in my startup, it represented measurable success. More importantly though, the access to better funding and better investors allowed me to have better conditions to focus on growing the company and doing what I love, while providing for my family. Even though we don&#x27;t have luxuries, the ability to work on something I love without my kids having to feel like they are sacrificing is a luxury in itself.<p>I would actually go so far to say that if you are doing a startup and have kids, YC is by far your best chance of creating a successful startup without having to go through financial distress.

I was completely unable to access my bank account online. Even when I could log in on a Windows desktop, there&#x27;s an extremely overly-complicated (and quite manual) certificate system also required.",1426035797
9181893,comment,9178765,9181819,0,0,jahewson,,,"I really doubt it, as that&#x27;s an unsound bypassing of the type system. Missing properties are slow in JavaScript, because the in-memory representation of the class has to be modified when new properties are added. Given that strong mode is about performance, it would make far more sense to just prohibit missing properties and encourage use of other ES6 language mechanisms such default parameters instead.",1426035792

Among the old timers, it seems almost a badge of honer to develop the longest, most clever SQL query that does everything in one step. Inevitably, there are problems, and people have trouble figuring out why because they can&#x27;t debug parts of the statement in isolation. In this case, it&#x27;s as if they have written an entire program in one line and can&#x27;t test parts in isolation. No doubt this is abuse of the language... and admittedly my SQL skills are not world class, but I keep scratching my head and wondering why they do this to themselves. If a query is so complex you can&#x27;t tell what it is doing, and it misbehaves, perhaps you would have been better off with some smaller queries you join in the program... nothing against joins... one or two or three of them... but really....<p>I keep asking myself if I&#x27;m missing something, but I sort of doubt it.",1426035698

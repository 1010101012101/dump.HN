You do this by asking questions, and testing the answers -- have them lay out their process for making the decision, have them identify the steps that have been reached and the steps that have not, have them identify other people in their organization who can block the purchase, and so on.  And you do this over and over again until you get the sale.<p>If the prospect can&#x27;t lay out the logical sequence of steps from here to close, then you need to qualify them out and stop spending time with them, because they&#x27;re not going to buy.<p>Two interesting corollaries:<p>* Yes, there are a LOT of people in a LOT of companies (as well as a lot of potential investors, potential recruits, etc.) who will spend a lot of time with you even though they can&#x27;t ultimately pull the trigger.  A lot of people like to windowshop, and a lot of people have nothing better to do.<p>* Like a lot of sales techniques, this sounds to engineers like it might be hard (will the potential customer tolerate all those questions?)

The most well known is Python, but Ruby, Prolog, and others exist.<p>Thus, PyPy is a transpiler from, say, Python to Javascript, etc.<p>LLVM is another such tool. It supports an asm.js backend, which gives quite good performance in modern Javascript engines. The end result is that you can compile C and other languages into Javascript.

Nothing would change were the score equal to all of the other pieces of the game combined, plus 1.<p>&quot;More importantly, philosophers, religious scholars, legal experts, and ethicists often assign an infinite value to human life.&quot;<p>We observe in real life that this isn&#x27;t true. We send people into space when we know there&#x27;s a non-trivial chance (~0.5%) that they will die. If we assigned an infinite value to their lives then we would never do that.<p>There would be no difference if &quot;infinity&quot; in this case were synonymous with &quot;all the wealth in the world.&quot;<p>&quot;And therein lies another kind of infinity: death. Assuming that nothing awaits us in the afterlife, the termination of our lives represents a kind of eternity.&quot;<p>This logic is inverted. Lives are finite. If time continues forever then the complement of &quot;finite&quot; (to cover the period when someone is not alive) is indeed infinite ... in the same way that the termination of 9 July 1904 is also a boundary between a finite time range and a hypothetical infinite time period.",1376475324

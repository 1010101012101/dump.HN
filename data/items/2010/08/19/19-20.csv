Location is important, but having a product out, or at least a prototype available, is more important. You can do this anywhere, and when you get seed money or funding later, you can move to somewhere glamorous. It's like moving to Hollywood because you want to be an actor or writer.<p>If you're the coder--especially if you're the coding founder--you can make the basic prototype first. Show people the value of your code then move after you've convinced them it's golden.  If you're not bringing money in or if you don't have a product yet, moving to another place will just burn up money.  You want to build your product and maximize what you can do with it instead of facing money troubles the minute you move.<p></rant>",1282247753

You have to worry about cross-browser compatibility and specific rendering bugs, whereas Flash authors don't. You have to rely on the slow JavaScript VMs included in even the fastest browsers (even the ""fast"" JS VMs are still rather slow), and then you have IE, which is still used by > 50% of internet users, of which much is IE 6 or 7, which are outdated and _extremely_ slow. You have audio synchronization issues. There is no ready-made IDE like Adobe's Flash IDE, meaning HTML5 development is much harder for many people. There are other issues too.<p>The fact is that HTML5 is not a reasonable general replacement for Flash. If you want your thing to work for most people, you are going to have to write in Flash anyway.

Gold, is pretty steady, so you can dollar cost average in if you think it is at a local maxima.   It benefits from being immune to inflation, plus it is entering into the bull market phase.<p>The way I know gold is just beginning its bull market is that your percpetion that it is ""scary"" is very common.  (and understandable)   It will be scary for a long time before it becomes ""a can't lose proposition that everyone has got to get into!""   We are at the ""Awareness"" phase where it is not uncommon to hear that you should buy gold.... but it is not a mainstream investment yet.<p>When it becomes one, and then enters a strong bull market, people who bought now will benefit greatly from not only the inflation protection, but this additional demand.<p>Unfortunately, that mainstreaming and additional demand will cause prices to go very high, resulting in people advocating it from a momentum basis, which will cause momentum to accelerate and gold will lift off and become a bubble.<p>Since we've all just lived thru the housing bubble we should be able to identify it.

1618332,comment,1617947,1617947,0,0,lzw,,,"Too broad a question for me to give a succinct answer, so this is going to be a bit all over the place.  But I've been investing for myself for about 2 decades, have participated in just about every type of investment, ending up preferring complex options strategies.  But I also am a fan of buy-n-hold, and commodities.<p>The best, first investment you can make is in money and time to get enough understanding and perspective to be able to sense the value of any investment.   All advice is static, but perspective is a dynamic benefit.<p>I strongly recommend reading ""Buffetology"" by Mary Buffet and ""How to invest like warren buffett"" by (I think) Timothy Vick.<p>Then spend time learning economics.  Economics in one lesson is available free online, and the Mises institute has regular articles on the state of the economy:  <a href=""http://mises.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org</a><p>It was from an article on the Mises institute in 2001 that I learned about the housing bubble.  Yes, that is two thousand and one.   I was well placed to profit when the bubble burst.<p>Here are some basics though: Buy things that are correctly valued where you have good reason to know they will appreciate.  Do not follow the pack.  The pack is wrong.  The conventional advice is, generally bad advice.<p>The US economic situation is in dire straights and to keep things going the fed is printing money like never before.  This is  why people are talking about buying gold.  This is pretty much a no-brainer.  Inflation is around %20, so by putting cash into gold you have a %20 return on purchasing power.  The reason people get confused is that they think that the dollar is a constant, but inflation erods purchasing power and even if it doesn't happen immediately and everywhere it does happen.  Gold, and other precious metals are a good hedge against inflation.<p>I've had good experiences in the past buying REIT type assets, in particular, you can buy Canadian Trusts that pay out a royalty based on the exploitation of mineral or oil or natural gas leases and wells.  A good one of these would be one that is growing reserves while still paying a good royalty.  Back when I was doing this, I was getting %5-%10 return, on top of stock price appreciation on top of a %5-%10 annualized growth in value due to the dollar slipping against the canadian dollar.<p>On currencies, generally countries with strong commodities based economies will do well, and countries with economies based on Keynesian ""stimulus"" spending will do bad.  So, if you do hold cash, try to hold it in currencies like the Canadian dollar.<p>Here's a quick economic lesson:  Any government ""Stimulus"" will do more damage than benefit the economy.  The reason for this is the government spends money poorly, but even if they spent it well, the act of spending does damage because they are taking the money out of the economy at the place where it would do the most good for economic growth.  Government spending all comes from taxes and inflation.  The tax money is taken out of corporate and individual profits-- off of the bottom line-- leaving less money for reinvestment and demand creation, exactly at the point where the demand and jobs are created.  Inflation hurts the same way by driving up ongoing expenses reducing profits and causing people to have less money to allocate to expansion.   Meanwhile the spending goes to boondoggles that are politically desired and benefit specific politicians and don't generally have a net positive economic return (They talked a lot about roads, but only a tiny fraction went to roads and a lot of that was lost in graft anyway.)<p>You can buy steady companies that are well run and which trade for less than their net values-- Aflac and Berkeshire Hathaway are two good examples of this.  I never bought Apple because, while I am an Apple fan it was outside my area of expertise.  I'm an engineer, but I can't predict the fotunes of the tech industry well enough!<p>IF someone else is going to manage your money, make it be Warren Buffett, not some fund manager on wallstreet. (probably the worse deal in the world is a mutual fund, and this includes index funds that take a percentage of your net worth for ""management"" that involves just buying stocks that appear on a list.  You can buy stocks off of a shopping list yourself.)<p>It is important to recognize that there is a lot of nonsense out there, a lot of conventional wisdom that has been passed down the generations that started out as stock brokers sales pitches.  Much of the industry is aligned around choices that are designed to make the people who peddle stocks, etc wealthy.<p>BTW, bonds are toast, will be killed by inflation and then when yields have to go up the low yielding bonds we're getting now due to ""quantitative easing"" are going to crater.<p>Oh, and read the Letters to Shareholders in the annual Berkshire Hathaway reports.  Good advice from the best investor in the country.   Buffett wont' advise you to buy commodities, he calls his purchase of silver ""a great mistake""-- which it was only because he sold too soon.   But he is good for general wisdom, and if you do decide to pick stocks, best to understand as much as you can how he does it.",1282246522

Of course, papers become more highly cited over time, and authors die and retire, so many of the most famous papers are in this state.<p>Traditionally, journals would send a few printed copies to the author so that the author could send them to people who wrote them asking for a copy, a custom that continues to some extent today.  Putting the final version of the paper on your web site is simply an extension of this approach.<p>Copyright is pretty much irrelevant as an incentive for production of academic work.  In nearly all fields, authors don't get paid by journals for writing papers.  In many cases, in fact, they have to pay for the privilege of writing those papers.  Academic books aren't net cash-flow negatives in the same way as journal and conference papers, but the total earnings per hour are very low.<p>In academic publishing, copyright has historically served as an incentive for <i>printing</i> academic work. Given our new methods of printing, using laser printers and computer screens, that incentive is no longer relevant.  The main issue today is to prevent the last copy of an old paper from being lost, and ensure that it can be found easily so that it can be copied.  Libraries are better suited to these purposes than printing companies.  Copyright in its current form is a serious menace to that kind of preservation.<p>Non-academic publishing may be a different ballgame, of course. I don't know.",1282245100

There's lots of great info on HN but it's scattered about among many threads. So you can't just go to wiki.ycombinator.com/angel-round and find out everything you need to know. You have to search, sift through the results ignoring false-positives (say, comments that reference raising an angel round but don't tell you <i>how</i> to raise one), etc.<p>So I guess the simplest way to state the need is that we need an easy way to access the wealth of high-quality information that's on HN. One solution is a wiki that structures a (hopefully high-quality) subset of that information.<p>The best solution, were it feasible, would probably be a super-""smart"" search engine where you could query ""How do I raise an angel round?"" and it would understand the query and scan HN's comments and submitted articles (since I'm sure people have submitted articles that give tips for raising an angel round) and return a lot of information that it has determined applies, is high-quality, and covers all of the issues thoroughly. But if you can write that, you should be applying it to the entire web and making billions, not just using it to search HN ;)<p>So that's an example of a solution that would be better.

Points of disagreement:<p>I do not understand why increasing Greek debt is supposed to be a solution to a crisis of overindebtedness. The conventional solution to debt crises is reducing the size of debt relative to GDP. The problem with Greece is that the country is stuck in deflation. It's GDP is contracting and that is making it even harder to pay off its debt. So the situation is getting worse because the government is pulling money out of the economy.<p>The more insidious problem with your proposed solution as I understand it is that investment is not highly responsive to interest rates in a liquidity trap. Keynes was the first one to talk about this. He has been proven empirically right: people don't borrow for a host of reasons in protracted economic slumps. This is why Japan can have a nominal interest rate of effectively zero for a decade and yet the private sector hasn't invested enough to create much growth.<p>The solution for Greece is fairly simple: debt restructuring to reduce its debt burden relative to GDP, so that the government doesn't need to plunge the country into deflation by pulling money out of the economy. France and Germany seem to prefer forcing economic contraction on Greece since this avoids their bondholders taking a cut or opens them to accusations of being soft on Greece. I'm not sure what the best balance of interests here is in part because I don't know how bad it really is in Greece, but however the distributional politics play out, I don't think your post makes much economic sense.

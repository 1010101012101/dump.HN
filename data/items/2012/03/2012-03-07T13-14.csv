When I am expecting someone to be a senior enough engineer, they should be able to look at someone's code during Code reviews and find the issues in it that can lead to problems without resorting to IDE/debugging.<p>I do agree that nano-questions are not useful <i>except</i> in situations where you get a resume with keyword bonanza: You know the kind, ones with every language,OS in the first page listed so that they will pass through the corporate recruiter filter. For those, nano-questions trip up but that will give me an indication to dig a little deeper into their IDE usage pattern.

I had a hard time fighting it, so much that I still consider it a true addiction (and still avoid falling on the same trap again).<p>When I started using firefox for the first time (whoa, tabs!), I started opening dozens of tabs at the same time, thinking I would read them all, one after another. But I could not, and their contents were interesting enough to prevent me from closing them. This habit followed for a long time, I installed a session saver, then I started using a feed reader. I had dozens of subscriptions and, if I didn't check my feeds for a whole day, soon there would be a hundred of them in my inbox  and I <i>had</i> to check them, or else I could lose information.<p>The stress came from the fear of losing information. It didn't matter if it were tabs, saved sessions or feeds, the idea of not reading any of those interesting articles was something hard to accept.

3675440,comment,3675047,3675047,20,0,justjimmy,,,"I used to make some money selling pixels as well, mainly from UO ('real estate' mainly since land in that game was very limited), City of Heroes, SWG and WoW. If you got in at the start (when selling on eBay was still 'legal') you made a pretty penny.<p>But it was unsustainable due to new MMOs, new tech and the rise of professional farmers. You had to constantly adapt, see where the game is going, and jump ship before the game collapses. I remember getting calls in the middle of the night from the west coast, asking about my auctions and how it all works and if there was more. And getting interrogated by my mum since  I'm getting all these calls from strangers.<p>Farming by hand, or playing the auction house no longer is the optimal way to go. Now people offer full blown services to play your toon for you, using VM, to mask/hide your IP incase you/they get caught (so you can claim you got hacked), with really good players charging up to thousands of dollars to play your character.<p>Good times.<p>EDIT: Now that I thought about it some more, I noticed my pattern at the beginning was doing everything myself, whether is scouring for bargains, farming gold, flipping properties  then I moved on to hiring people within the game and paying them in-game gold for them to farm for me (in SWG, I would provide locations of mineral fields to my 'employee's and set a price ahead of time how much I'd pay per unit, and I'd buy all they have)  then I moved on to automatic botting/scripting in WoW. Interestingly, this aligns somewhat closely to real life industries and how they improve output.<p>Then I also realized first there was the emergence of sellers (the farmers), then came the companies that has its own farming team in addition to buying pixels from farmers and flipping them for profit. And finally, the arrival of platforms  connecting direct buyers with direct sellers while taking a cut (similar to eBay)  and it's these guys are making the real money  taking zero risks (not worrying about getting caught), providing minimal support and very scalable.<p>And now the gaming companies wants to keep everything to themselves and take a cut. Blizzard's D3 will be paid close attention to how its Auction House system works out  it will be very, very interesting to see where it all leads.",1331128075

I'm a full-time developer by day (4 years in the game now :)) however, I'm currently enrolled in a Professional MBA program at the local University. I'm now taking a Leadership course and one of our projects involves ""New Media Engagement"" (essentially in a sense ""crowd sourcing"" a dialogue/discussion on Leadership). Because of how awesome the HN community is I thought I'd bring my research to this forum.<p>This discussion will help me greatly in my report out for my Leadership course. But enough about me this question is truly about you all.<p>As I look out over the landscape of our community (which I believe broadly encompasses: Software Development, Technology, Web Design, Entrepreneurship, etc.) I tend to notice a trend in our leadership. For the most part those we consider leaders in our community aren't the gentlemen/women doing the most hand-waving and evangelizing about what they support, instead they are often some of the more thoughtful, brilliant minds, and thought leaders in our community whom we respect for their talent. Although we have our various camps and flame wars I think largely my previous assertion rings true.<p>What I'm curious to understand, and hopefully the HN community can help me further develop this thought, is why doesn't this same trend tend to transfer well into other industries (i.e. Politics, Civic Organizations, etc.)? I realize this is a very broad stroke I'm painting here but I believe this holds generally. As a corollary, do you all think that this trend is truly reflective off our community? Do you think it (i.e. our typically higher levels of rationality) gives us a potential sustainable competitive advantage with respect to other industries moving forward?

I think good engineers have to be able to work effectively at a high ""system"" level of abstraction as well as at a low ""compilation"" level of abstraction. If you can't look at a chunk of code and know enough about the language to know that it could throw a ClassCastException, then it is quite likely that you will fall prey to other language gotchas which can bubble up and destroy the entire design of the system you're trying to build.<p>I don't think the current state of the art in software development has yet advanced to the point where we can just black-box away all of the entire ""compilation"" stuff such that it never affects the ""system"" stuff. I really would like that to be the case, because it would eliminate a lot of unnecessary complexity in software development.<p>I think asking a limited number of compiler-level questions (less than 5) in an interview doesn't take up a lot of time, and can allow you to get an idea of how much actual experience the candidate has with the language as well as dealing with nitty-gritty problems that come up while you're coding.

It fetches the post from the DB each time you load the page.

It will render the page with a specific timeout (3600 seconds is default I think?, 1 hr) and then just serve up that HTML rather than hitting the DB. This will solve 99% of your problems.

ARM either has 16 bit (thumb mode) or 32 bit (normal) fixed-size instructions.<p>Also for every ISA there are some instructions that are very common, for example x86 has very-recognizable NOPs (0x90).<p>Having said that, seeing it is ARM<i>v3</i> code specifically in one glance is pretty impressive.",1331126270
3675332,story,,,1,0,hummingbird1,"Sampling Challenges",http://blog.reseapro.com/?p=113,"Because researchers can seldom study the entire population, they must choose a subset of the population, which can result in several types of error.  Sometimes, there are discrepancies between the sample and the population on a certain parameter that are due to random differences.  This is known as sampling error and can occur through no fault of the researcher.<p>Far more problematic is systematic error, which refers to a difference between the sample and the population that is due to a systematic difference between the two rather than random chance alone.  The response rate problem refers to the fact that the sample can become self-selecting, and that there may be something about people who choose to participate in the study that affects one of the variables of interest.  It is very possible in this situation that the people who actively seek help happen to be more proactive than those who do not.  Because these two groups vary systematically on an attribute that is not the dependent variable (economic productivity), it is very possible that it is this difference in personality trait and not the independent variable (if they received corrective lenses or not) that produces any effects that the researcher observes on the dependent variable.  This would be considered a failure in internal validity.<p>Another type of systematic sampling error is coverage error, which refers to the fact that sometimes researchers mistakenly restrict their sampling frame to a subset of the population of interest.<p>First and foremost, a researcher must think very carefully about the population that will be included in the study and how to sample that population.Errors in sampling can often be avoided by good planning and careful consideration.However, in order to improve a sampling frame, a researcher can always seek more participants.In the case of the response rate problem, the researcher can actively work on increasing the response rate, or can try to determine if there is in fact a difference between those who partake in the study and those who do not.The most important thing for a researcher to remember is to eliminate any and all variables that the researcher cannot control.While this is nearly impossible in field research, the closer a researcher comes to isolating the variable of interest, the better the results.",1331126238

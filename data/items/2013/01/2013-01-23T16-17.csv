I've met many people who were brilliant at things, but under these types, even those with less brilliance often performed better. Anecdotal evidence, true, but still.

5103894,comment,5095495,5098798,1,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"It's not that you said it in a positive light.  It's that you used it as a common noun.  The term ""free market"" is only useful as a comparative, like so: ""America has freer markets than India"".  This lets people know and contextualize what you're saying.<p>Otherwise, using the term just turns into a competition of politics between Republican shills (ie: you), minarcho-capitalist (""libertarian"") ideologues, mutualist anarchists, and socialists on what it means to be a ""free market"", how ""free"" a market has to be to qualify for the term, and whether the relative ""freedom"" or lack thereof of a market matters at all.<p>I fall into that last camp.  There are actually reputable studies showing that given 100% Free markets never occur in reality (perfect competition, perfect information, zero transaction costs were the definition they used), most not-completely-retarded allocation mechanisms <i>other</i> than those are more-or-less as decent as each other; there was basically a 3% allocative-efficiency advantage to the <i>realistically imperfect</i> market over the tested form of central planning.<p>A mathematician also showed that even perfect theoretical markets can oscillate neverendingly between <i>multiple</i> general equilibriums rather than ever converging to <i>one</i> efficient equilibrium.<p>In conclusion, stop using the term ""free market"" outside of meaningful context.",1358960128

5103890,comment,5103031,5103439,9,0,tomsaffell,,,"In terms of 'good / bad', it's basically a trade-off between bandwidth and distance the signal can travel. A high carrier frequency allows a higher bandwidth[1], but it doesn't travel far/well. A low frequency can travel far, but doesn't support high bandwidth. So there is a sweet-spot (which is <i>currently</i> considered 'good') that achieves a balance of BW and distance. There's a great guide here:<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/spectrum/bbc-the-spectrum-and-its-uses.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/spectrum/bbc-the-spectrum-and-i...</a> (see page 5)<p>1] the carrier frequency doesn't itself determine the bandwidth, it's the frequency range that does. For example, if someone says ""a 100 Mhz signal"", that doesn't tell you what the bandwidth is. You need to also know that the signal is actually allowed to cover 99.9 Mhz to 100.1 Mhz, so it's bandwidth is 0.2 Mhz (which could transfer ~0.2Mbps (order of magnitude accurate), depending on the encoding system used[2]). But if someone says ""a 100 Mhz signal"" you can guess that they don't mean the signal is allowed to cover 70 Mhz to 130 Mhz (60 Mhz of bandwidth), because: a) that's a ~2x range in frequency, which make it hard to design appropriate aerials, filters, modulators, etc; b) that isn't how spectrum is actually allocated anywhere I know of. So in practice you can normally deduce the approximate bandwidth by knowing the carrier frequency. Apologies for the long explanation - I've been nitpicked before on this..<p>2] see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate</a>",1358960086

It usually takes 5-10 hours to do the basic stuff (strategy and on-site optimization), and then another 10-50 to initiate the harder stuff (developing content and building backlinks).<p>I will examine your site or product, develop a complete SEO strategy, give you tips and clues on what needs to be corrected on your site, do keyword research and develop content for your site - eventually starting the grind job of building backlinks.<p>Who am I?<p>I'm a SEO professional making $170K a year doing project lead and SEO work. I really, really love SEO. SEO is one of my main passions in life. I love logical link hierarchies, finding new sources of backlinks, explaining the importance of digital distribution of content to newbies, doing technical SEO and seeing Google gradually index a site. I love Penguin and Panda - and I love the sheer amount of intelligence that goes ranking in Google. I also own 10-20 sites with Pagerank ranging from 4 to 6. My own sites attract 150-200.000 visitors per week, largely because of SEO.<p>Why the deal?<p>Together with a few friends, I'm moving to the SF Bay area in august/september of 2013. I don't know too many people there yet, but I think I'm pretty aligned with most of the guys here on Hacker News. This is a nice way to (possibly) get some new friends whilst doing something I love.

You may believe market saturation is ""bullshit"", but it's much harder to get noticed in an already crowded field.<p>There seems to be two fields of thought on researching and marketing a bootstrapped product:<p>1) SEO and niche marketing. This is the sort of thing that Rob Walling talks about. Basically the idea is you research through Google keywords that you can rank highly for and build a product around that, regardless of what you yourself are good at. The problem with this is that the internet is full of scumbags and many online audience ""niches"" are already taken. PPC is extremely competitive as well.<p>2) Content marketing and ""become famous"". This is the approach that I think Amy and Ryan Carson recommend. This has a longer path to success, years in some cases, and is highly subject to survivorship bias.

Actually, the reason for his success is that he initially started with an underserved market, and then used that to gain SEO knowledge and internet fame to leverage #2 to some extent.<p>I've emailed with Amy on this regard, her tone has been basically ""Well, it works because he's Patrick"".

I noticed some patterns.<p>One was that every technical question after the third one was usually a waste. Anyone who hit it out of the park on the first three, hit almost all of the subsequent ones out of the park. No one who struggled through the first three would suddenly start doing well on the subsequent questions.<p>Another thing I noticed is people fell into a Gaussian distribution. Some were on the left end of it, but most of those were weeded out by the recruiters, or by resumes or finally by phone screens. Just like a bell curve, most of the people were in the middle. Of the dozens I interviewed in person, only three were on the right end of the bell curve. Which is before you even get to soft skills.<p>Your results speak for themselves.

As someone who worked at two different companies that received these kinds of communications from Steve, I can say that he usually only struck out at companies he knew well, like Palm. Ed probably doesn't know it, but Steve actually threatened Palm in much the same way years earlier. He did the same sputtering act about prceived poaching with Motorola around 2005, which took some stones, since at the same time he and his guys were busy playing MOT like a pinball machine to teach them how to make phones and how to do business with AT&T.

""It's like Facebook's News Feed, but instead you get audio updates instead of text updates!"".  Hackers can be guilty of this often - focused obsession on improving the world (or a piece of it) by tackling even the smallest problems.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but not necessarily a guarantee of success.<p>A Product:  Instagram is a product.  It's full-featured, it's beloved (or was ;), it's free-standing, it works, and people use it.  But do people pay for it?  Would they?  Would they make money by themselves or only in the context of a bigger company (like Facebook).  Twitter is also a product, along these lines.<p>A Business:  37signals is a business.  People pay them to use their products.  They are free-standing, they are profitable, and they don't _need_ outside investors (need vs. want is different, btw - sometimes it makes sense to take strategic investment).<p>There's nothing inherently wrong with any of the above paths, btw.  But you need to understand which path you're on, because you'll do a better job of it that way.  If you decide to be on the feature/product path and hope to get acquired/acqui-hired, that's fine - it's a legitimate approach (that works, at least for now) and folks have made $billions doing it (see: Instagram & everyone else).<p>But it's a different path than starting a business.  Goals are different, operations are different, and outcome is different.<p>The point, in the end, is that often the response - ""well, I guess we'll sell ads"" is what people who are starting features or products often say to convince themselves or others that they're on a worthwhile _business_ endeavor.  And that's often dishonest (intentional or not).<p>Understand the path you're on and I'm willing to bet success will be more likely.",1358957445

For example I'm pretty rusty as a programmer, having graduated to management many years ago (and a linux admin before that) and I could pass this test, but you wouldn't want me as a senior programmer.<p>The point I'm getting at, is that like any science experiment you need to control for the variables. Just like an economics experiment might control for wealth, or education, you have to control for people who get nervous during interviews, people who have a blind spot for this particular problem, etc.<p>An easy addition to your methodology would be to have three different problems and let them choose.  I would see how that affects their performance.<p>In my company I give potential hires a test for them to complete at home, before even interviewing them. The average time to complete the test is 6 hours, but we've never had anyone outright refuse to attempt it, and it gives us a giant steaming pile of data.  So if my experience is any guide (and it might not be) I would think you could make your test more intensive, and potentially end up with more and better candidates.",1358957443

While threads don't have the ""web scale to 100,000 users!!!"" reputation, you can still get very far with them on most workloads.<p>On evented application servers, you can integrate with the event loop API.<p>And, I'm not 100% sure whether the spec allows this, but it would appear that on application servers that are not evented, you can even offload the socket to a thread running an event loop.

Bigger plants are the ones that reach this limit later, e.g. have evolved ways of using prior root systems/trunks to their benefit overtime.<p>Plants <i>can</i> essentially live forever through cloning, where the plant lays new roots and isn't stuck on its former shell.<p>On the other hand stressed plants go to seed (a good evolutionary move) and statistically no plant lives forever in the wild, with fires and etc, so perhaps this data is more of a testament to how fragile a plant is... e.g. how easily it's killed. It makes sense that smaller = more fragile, more easily burnt/frozen to death, etc.",1358957193

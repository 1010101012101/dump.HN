Given the additive properties of bitcoin keys it would even be pretty easy to make a key that was very very unlikely to be recoverable. Three people separately generate keys, throw away the private keys, and then mine to the product of the three public keys. It would take all three of them lying about throwing away the private keys and then collaborating to recover the combined private key to get the coins back.",1407967133

So if you can ever build a program that can take an arbitrary goal and output the program source code then you can also solve arbitrary natural language queries efficiently.<p>So most &quot;supposedly&quot; AI systems do brute force or probabilistic templating - i.e. mapping the query to a known structure of sentences. Then you get translation of these known structures of sentences to known machine level structured queries. This is why systems like Siri would fail on its face as soon as you ask even mildly &quot;hard&quot; question. For example, queries that starts with &quot;How many...&quot; such as &quot;How many teeth humans have?&quot; are very easy to solve and in fact it can be your weekend project for Wikipidea corpus with impressive accuracy.

If she is lucky enough to get through on the phone she then has to be lucky enough to have been one of the first patients to get through (it is normally engaged due to high demand). Once she is on the list she has to go down to the practice and wait. That wait could be up to 3 hours. She is blind and deaf.<p>I live in Germany on the other hand and I am privately insured. I can get to see a doctor easily. However my health insurance has a strange caveat in that I must see and be referred by my GP if I have to see a specialist doctor.

For one, the lengths the mobile industry is going to restrict the use of unique device identifiers poses a complexity to identify the same device across sessions. Moreover, anonymous users pose an issue for services with a value proposition behind their cross-device/platform support. Also, for small sites, it may not be trivial to introduce a data-model that supports anonymous data, which either needs to be thrown out or eventually merged with account-linked data. Similarly, 3rd-party engagement and funnel analysis of anonymous users is also a hard problem, as when the user does eventually identify themselves with an account, you need to merge their previously anonymous data into their account. Some services call this Aliasing.<p>I&#x27;ll echo other comments that the content is sparse - this section specifically speaks as if <i>registration count</i> is the sole goal of the target audience. A comprehensive document would account other conversion-like goals that site/app makers might have, and the weigh the cost-benefit analysis of requiring registration.",1407964495

You still have to distribute the calls that <i>actually</i> depend on mutable state, but if your language starts out with a clean distinction between pure functions and operations whose result might depend on mutable state, you start out miles ahead when it comes to dealing with distribution compared to working with a language which provides no language level distinction between pure and impure code, requiring either manual segregation or treat-everything-as-state-dependent-and-pay-the-cost approaches.",1407964347

What is my conversion/impression/sales, etc. for the month/quarter and how does that compare to previous month/quarter or a specific date?<p>So, what I mean is if I have an event coming up and I am marketing to that event - I have email lists, twitter accounts, FaceBoook, a popular blog, co-op email partners, and I buy ads on multiple platforms...I want to know how many people came from each source, what the conversion rate was, how far they got in the process, and I want to see how this year&#x27;s event is comparing to last years&#x27;. Or last months&#x27;. Or last weeks&#x27;. Or an event I had three quarters ago.<p>I need the data to be as accurate as I can get, because if people are coming into the site, and all of the ones coming from, say, Twitter, are not buying and don&#x27;t even read anything, then I need to know that.<p>As an example, for a sports event I run in the summer, two years ago I dropped PayPal as an option entirely. I had so many complaints from consumers about PayPal in general I just decided to implement Stripe. A lot of people told me that since PayPal is so ubiquitous, I would be cutting out an ease-of-payment option and I would lose sales.<p>But my data showed two things: a lot of people DID use PayPal but I lost a ton of conversions when people hit the PayPal page AND my #1 complaint topic was PayPal related. About 60% of the people who signed up used PayPal.<p>Both of the last two years after implementing Stripe my conversion rate increased dramatically and I have ZERO complaints about the payment process. Literally, zero.<p>So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m always looking for. How do I optimize and track turning people who are searching into customers without wasting their time or my time? How do I remove frustration for users? Where do they navigate to? If they hit a specific page and then suddenly jump around looking for a &#x27;contact us&#x27; page, I need to figure out what those people are looking for and fix it for them.<p>With Google analytics or adwords, I get some data but a lot of it other than a few pieces is superficial or the data doesn&#x27;t match my server logs.<p>Sorry for the digression.",1407964203

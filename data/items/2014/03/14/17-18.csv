7400611,comment,7399895,7400472,2,0,nirnira,,,"Neuroplasticity primarily relates to the evolved ability of young children to rapidly, <i>effortlessly</i> acquire basic, evolutionarily critical behaviours - language systems and other core social behaviour necessary for tight social integration (and later various more complex but still critical secondary social behaviours) in a small hunter gatherer pack essentially - all picked up subconsciously from the social environment.<p>The important difference is that all of this acquisition is a result of tens of thousands of years of consistent natural selection. It&#x27;s hard-wired because humans have needed these things, and children have needed them as fast as possible, for a long long time.<p>The things humans attempt to learn in modern times however (non-native languages, formal systems of logic, the ability to argue and reason in complex fashions, the ability to program complex systems) are completely evolutionarily unprecedented, and the result is clear: children are not able to acquire these behaviours effortlessly. They don&#x27;t just rub off. Instead they (generally) require focussed, extensive supervision and tuition from humans that have already put in the hard work of mastering them.<p>So the relevance of neuroplasticity still seems small to me.",1394819955

You may choose going more technical, getting a degree and becoming a full time developer, if thats what you see yourself doing then go for it, anybody can learn to code.  But it seems that you have not went that far for a reason and so you should think hard about it before investing your time into something you dont want to do for a long time.<p>Good luck whatever you choose.<p>BTW, i make $80k+ a year and thats actually pretty low for my position.",1394819909

But if you look at the number if programmers under age 18, I suspect the gap will be even wider than > 18. Something about society is pushing young women away from it.<p>Some of my suspicions:<p>1. The internet is generally more hostile to girls. If you stumble into the wrong chat room or forum, you get &quot;show your tits&quot;. When I started programming, I got on the internet for help and met some amazing friends who helped me become a better programmer.<p>I absolutely hate when gender topics come up on HN because I generally like this website, but gender topics tend to bring the assholes out of the woodwork. I got a female CS student friend of mine reading HN regularly, but when she ran into one of these sorts of threads she was appalled. And rightfully so. And HN isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as the internet at large.<p>2. It&#x27;s tied to video games being male majority. I played computer video games a lot more than any girls I knew as a kid. This exposure to computers (and config files, etc) set the stage for programming.<p>The video game realm is making a lot of progress in getting girls playing (I think more or consoles than PC, but the general trend is up everywhere), and I&#x27;ve seen this positively influence girls&#x27; predispositions towards programming.<p>3. There is a positive feedback loop in social circles, particularly in formative years (middle school). Kids encourage the status quo. So it&#x27;s hard for a kid to develop hobbies outside of their clique. I think this relates to the gender problem because girls at that age tend to be even more exclusive than boys (at least in my experience and everyone I&#x27;ve asked).<p>But those are just suspicions and the real problem could be more fundamental.",1394818754

Things have changed somewhat since I entered the school, but the ideas are mostly the same.<p>For my class, there were three intro-level programming courses, each a prereq for the next: introductory programming for those with no experience, introduction to data structures, and fundamentals of algorithm and data structure analysis. A pre-test given over the summer was used to establish which class you were put into. According to the department, roughly one-third of the class ended up in each one. I had no programming experience coming in, so I was put in the first class.<p>The final course of that intro sequence was also the major fundamentals course for one of the three tracks that the curriculum branched out to after the first intro class, focusing on algorithms and their implementations. The other two tracks focused on systems programming and mathematical interaction (via functional programming).<p>Every student, regardless of their intro class, typically completes these tracks by the end of their second year or early into their third year, which opens up basically all of the 300- or 400-level specialization courses in the department. Which is why the school doesn&#x27;t need to focus on people with lots of experience coming in--the structure of the curriculum means that everyone gets to the same level of important fundamentals pretty quickly, and once you&#x27;ve done that you get to branch out and specialize into whatever you want. The more experienced newcomers just have more time to do that.<p>And anecdotally, the approach has definitely worked. I&#x27;ve got a great job lined up starting this summer that I&#x27;m excited to start. I am not a woman so I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness in attracting women specifically, but in my experience the school has done a great job accommodating a wide range of experience levels.",1394817949

But one main reason to synchronize threads is to prevent shared data from being corrupted from concurrent access.

Modern organizational structures (esp at big companies), usually puts in non-technical management in places where they take on higher-level responsibilities driving product and business. Think product managers, or high level sales directors, etc. Technical contributors&#x27; skills are treated as &quot;too valuable&quot; to waste on these management duties, but paradoxically, the opportunity for a technical person to contribute at a high level or early decision points ends up as something often held separate from the engineering career ladder (until you get very high up).<p>I come across mentions of WWII era projects, designs of famous aircraft etc where the designs were incredibly well suited to the needs, and produced in incredibly short time-frames. Some of that is obviously the war-time focus, but I also notice that in many of those projects the lead position is not a non-technical manager, but a technical chief engineer where management functions must have been subservient.  Unfortunately, there isn&#x27;t a huge amount written about the organizational day-to-day project structures during WWII.<p>I think at least some of the appeal of startups and smaller companies for technically oriented people is that division of responsibility is not as formalized and contributions can flow more easily between different domains.

They usually seem to feel the company is lucky to have them, as with some effort they could get into a slightly better job.  They often do, especially after static happens at a company.<p>A boss goes to his own boss, and that boss gives him an unrealistic goal to be accomplished in a short time frame.

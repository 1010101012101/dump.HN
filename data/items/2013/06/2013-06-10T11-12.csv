5853690,comment,5853081,5853081,1,0,bobsy,,,"On the topic of nukes. What is the point of them...<p>Conventional warfare.. you cannot send in nukes before your troops to soften up the enemy. Assuming you lose an invasion you cannot send them in after you pull your troops out.<p>You cannot use them for precision strikes.<p>You cannot use them over your own country should it get invaded.<p>Apparently they are a deterrent from getting nuked yourself. Are they though? Nukes blow up civilians. Civilians do not press the big red button. Crack pot lunatics do from some deep underground bunker. Would you really launch a counter-strike killing potentially millions of civilians. I wouldn&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t answer genocide with genocide.<p>The only use I can see is a small tactical nuke which could be used to blow up an enemy fleet at sea. Even then, launching the nuke in way that it wouldn&#x27;t get intercepted I guess would be difficult. The implications for such a use would also be pretty profound.<p>In the UK the Government want to / will renew trident. The UK nuke system. I don&#x27;t really understand why. The cost is in the billions. The weapon is unsafe, as well as expensive to protect and maintain.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the current state of the UN is right now is but it seems to me a better solution would be to give the UN 50 nukes or whatever. The UN then becomes the deterrent. Pass a resolution. &#x27;Those who use Nuclear weapons will be counter-nuked.&#x27; Other nations can then give them up.<p>The only danger with nukes is that only one country has them. They can then threaten others &#x27;Do as I say or be obliterated.&#x27; Realistically though so many countries know how to make nukes I can&#x27;t imagine it would take too long to rearm in this scenario.",1370865309

Combining the two questions is strangely reminiscent of why does it take forever to roll out ipv6 and sunset ipv4?<p>Its possible for new stuff I&#x27;d evaluate the field and possibly an E.C. tech might win.

The password does NOT get transmitted and there is nothing like a master key or similar.

5853601,comment,5853216,5853508,13,0,ColinWright,,,"Not really, no.<p>Very briefly ...<p>==== Start RSA recap<p>Given an integer n>1, the numbers <i>a</i> s.t. <i>0<=a<n</i> and <i>gcd(a,n)</i> form a group under multiplication.  That means that for every <i>e</i> with <i>gcd(e,n)=1</i> there is a <i>d</i> s.t. <i>d.e=1 (mod n)</i>.<p>Now take <i>n=pq</i> where <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are primes.  The function <i>phi(n)</i> counts how many elements are co-prime to <i>n</i>, and since <i>n=pq</i> that turns out to be <i>(p-1)(q-1)</i>.  So <i>phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1).</i>  I&#x27;m going to write <i>r=phi(n).</i><p>Take any <i>e</i> with <i>gcd(e,r)=1.</i>  We can compute <i>d</i> s.t. <i>d.e=1 (mod r),</i> which means <i>d.e = k.r+1</i> for some <i>k.</i> (Note: I&#x27;m doing this mod r, not mod n.)<p>Right.<p>Now take a message <i>M</i> (with <i>0<=M<n</i> and <i>gcd(M,n)=1</i>) and compute <i>E=M^e</i>.  We can do that fairly quickly using an adapted Russian Peasant Multiplication algorithm.  This number &quot;looks random&quot; in some sense.  You can transmit it to someone else.<p>They compute <i>D=E^d</i>.  So what&#x27;s that?  Well, working modulo n:<p><pre><code>    D = E^d
      = (M^e)^d
      = M^(d.e)
      = M^(k.r+1)
      = M^(k.r) x M
      = (M^r)^k x M
</code></pre>
But Euler&#x27;s extension of Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem says that if <i>gcd(a,n)=1</i>, then <i>a^phi(n)=1 (mod n)</i>.  Therefore <i>M^r=1 (mod n)</i>, and so <i>D=M.</i><p>Therefore we can recover <i>M</i>, so we can decrypt <i>E.</i><p>So if you publish <i>n</i> and <i>e</i>, but keep <i>d</i> secret, people can send you <i>E=M^e (mod n)</i> and only you can read it.<p>Probably.<p>If someone can compute <i>phi(n)</i> then they can compute <i>d</i> from <i>e</i> and <i>n</i>, but we think that&#x27;s the same as factoring <i>n.</i>  Similarly, if you can compute discrete logarithms, but that seems to be about as hard as factoring.<p>==== End RSA recap.<p>All of this can be cast more abstractly in the group (Z/nZ, * ).  Doing so gives us the same system in more generality.  This is what ECC does.  You choose and publish an elliptic curve - <i>C</i>.  Then you choose an element, <i>e</i>, and compute its inverse <i>d</i> in <i>C</i>.  You encrypt a message <i>M</i> by taking <i>e.M</i> (remembering that in ECC we usually use + as the operation symbol instead of * - so this is the equivalent of <i>M^e</i>).<p>And it all works.<p>Possibly someone who knows more about this than I will find gaping holes in the above, but I think that should get you started.<p>To address the other question:<p><pre><code>    > I always thought that elliptic curves were
    > an algorithm to break cryptography like RSA
</code></pre>
There is also Lentra&#x27;s Elliptic Curve Integer Factoring Algorithm.  That is basically the Pollard Rho factoring method, but in a group corresponding to an Elliptic Curve, rather than in the usual Z/nZ.  Factoring integers can result in breaking RSA, and Elliptic Curves can be used in factoring, but that&#x27;s a different question.",1370863900

If I remember well, RSA is based on the fact that Z/pZ is a group when p is prime (for those who don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s about taking the addition and multiplications for the numbers in [0..p-1] and taking the result modulo p), and elliptic curves offer a more generic framework for that...",1370862094

How many lives is a promise worth?<p>I&#x27;d much rather have a politician that bas his plans on the latest known evidence, rather than blindly adhering to promises made.  This isn&#x27;t to suggest that this is what happened here, but frankly, it&#x27;s too early to tell.  Information is still being spilled day by day.<p>And for many of this, it isn&#x27;t news.  It&#x27;s stuff we&#x27;ve known was going on for a long time.  But shit, some whistleblower comes out and everyone suddenly becomes all for privacy, forgetting that countless times scaremongers and conspiracy theorists were shouted down.<p>This is what the American people voted for many times, not just in the presidential elections.  And it didn&#x27;t start with Obama.<p>So, until you can answer &quot;How many lives is a promise worth?&quot; you&#x27;re simply playing arm chair politics.

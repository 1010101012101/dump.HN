You might consider looking closely at Air France 447, which crashed with the loss of all souls aboard as a direct result of its FBW system <i>not</i> providing realistic feedback. In a non-FBW aircraft, or even in a 777, it would not have been possible for an inexperienced copilot to stall the aircraft all the way from cruise altitude to impact, without anyone else in the cockpit being aware of what was going on.<p>Remote control isn&#x27;t a panacea, either. What happens when that system is also compromised by whatever mishap has the aircraft in trouble to begin with? With a pilot on board, it&#x27;s possible at least some of those aboard the aircraft might survive.

Perfect safety is a pipe dream, and the rule of diminishing returns applies here as everywhere else.<p>Compared to modern aviation, the early days were just chock-full of accidents and incidents, because we hadn&#x27;t encountered the 90% cases in order to solve them. Happily, we&#x27;ve solved those cases and more, which is how we come to have the luxury of confusing edge and corner cases, like deliberate CFIT (e.g. Germanwings 9525), with major safety issues.<p>Introducing full-on, pilotless cockpit automation is going to have the same high incident rate that early aviation did, for the same reasons -- we just don&#x27;t know enough about the problem domain to account for the 90% cases, so we&#x27;re going to have to see them fall out of the sky and hit the ground before we know how to solve them.<p>And, of course, there&#x27;s also the fact that pilotless aviation can&#x27;t actually solve all the edge and corner cases of piloted aviation, but only some of them. It&#x27;d make deliberate CFIT a thing of the past, sure! But deliberate CFIT, and things like it, aren&#x27;t the only reasons why a commercial aircraft falls out of the sky. Sometimes it&#x27;s maintenance error; sometimes it&#x27;s equipment failure; sometimes we don&#x27;t even know what happened. Pilotless aviation won&#x27;t address all of these cases.<p>Eventually, I don&#x27;t doubt, we would achieve the same excellent safety record with pilotless aircraft that we see right now with piloted ones. The question boils down to whether, in order to address a subset of the corner cases in piloted aviation, it&#x27;s worth accepting the costly process of working out the 90% cases in pilotless aviation. I really do not think it&#x27;s Luddism to regard the tradeoff there as not worth making.",1428414232

To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience building complex single-page applications using Ember.js<p>- You have an expert understanding of JavaScript<p>- You have experience writing back-end code using Ruby on Rails<p>- You have experience with continuous integration, automated tests, and build  processes<p>- You have a proven history of designing and building world-class user interfaces<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>- You are design-minded, have excellent taste, and are detail-oriented<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, consists mostly of engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100%\nfor dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Relocation assistance, if you want to move to NYC.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply here: <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/6a8e05c1-cd3e-45cf-b70b-5a9ae2e697ae?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/6a8e05c1-cd3e-45cf-b70b-5a9ae2...</a>",1428414206

Its not the a single step, nor has all situations which a driver/pilot has to deal with been automated to the point in which a computer can do all the work successfully.<p>It is however a great goal, one which spells safer, faster, and consecutive safer technology with every step. Modern cars already has some forms of brake systems which can take control away from the driver during a crash-like situation, so the same concept for planes could be applied if it can be made safe enough. We also have kill-switches in cars which can be triggered remotely, so I could easily see a similar system be implemented which locks a plane into auto-pilot with a per-determined height and GPS direction.<p>Neither will replace pilots overnight, so they continue having low blood pressure and know that they still got a job tomorrow.

One, Arduino LLC was founded by [Massimo Banzi], [David Cuartielles], [David Mellis], [Tom Igoe] and [Gianluca Martino] in 2009, runs the website arduino.cc, and has been directing and releasing the code that makes it all work. Most of these folks had been working together on what would become the Arduino project since as early as 2005.<p>The other “Arduino” used to be called Smart Projects and was the manufacturing arm of the project founded and run by [Gianluca Martino]. Smart Projects changed their name to Arduino SRL in November 2014. (A “Società a responsabilità limitata” is one form of Italian limited-liability company.)

Until then, I begin to wonder if it wouldn&#x27;t be best to (ugh) disable HTTPS for Chrome 42+ users, since most people will perceive a red lock thing on their status bar as &quot;less secure&quot; than the &quot;silently gray&quot; HTTP (even if technically, that&#x27;s obviously not the case). If Google decides SHA-1 is so bad that it deserves being visibly marked as insecure, then why don&#x27;t they also show a red cross on HTTP sites?<p>EDIT: oops, missed the &quot;valid past 2015&quot; part. My question is still valid, isn&#x27;t insecure HTTP more deserving of a red cross than SHA-1 certs that expire in, say, 2016?",1428412390

9333678,comment,9330650,9332758,0,0,VLM,,,"I was a little confused based on your report of MD compared to my home state.  I googled and it turns out MD is pretty normal after all.<p>When you apprentice you sign a contract stating what you&#x27;ll be paid as you learn and attend classes.  In my state the union rate is a bit over $30/hr and the legal contract for apprentices over the course of their 4 years (same as in MD) must average at least 60% of union rate.  Usually it progresses somewhat steeply over those four years.  Doctors tend not to be cash flow positive for a little while... electricians are cash flow positive after a month or so (need to pay for tools, etc)<p>You can&#x27;t work as an electrician for those 4 years without being directly (like in sight) supervised by a master electrician.  Its like being a student, although you&#x27;re getting paid rather than paying for it.  I think the closest doctor analogy to electrician apprenticeship would be &quot;internship year&quot;<p>After your 4 year contract is up you get a journeymans card, and can work by yourself without a master directly supervising you.  Not 7 years, not even in MD.  Very controversially some states allow journeymen to act as mini-masters supervising a small number of unlicensed workers (like 1, although I&#x27;ve heard as many as 3 depending on state) with the assumption they&#x27;ll be grunt labor.  Your boss will remain a master electrician.  I think a pretty good doctor analogy would be &quot;resident years&quot;<p>After a couple years you can test for master, and if you make it, you&#x27;ll be able to supervise and train your own small herd of apprentices and generally get paid a bit more than a journeyman.  Also bonding and insurance and licenses and permits are only possible if you&#x27;re a master.  If you&#x27;re smart enough to become a master there is really no downside to becoming one.  I think the closest medical analogy to a master electrician is &quot;hospital administrator&quot; or maybe &quot;department head&quot; or &quot;private practice&quot;<p>An apprentice sits in a truck owned by a master with the master physically in the drivers seat next to him, a journeyman sits in a truck owned by the master with a fairly traditional somewhat distant supervisory relationship with his boss who is a master, and a master owns trucks and probably has some combination of journeymen working for him and noob apprentices learning from him.  There are plenty of master electricians who don&#x27;t have employees, but you need to be a master to have employees.<p>One of my army buddies got out, got a philosophy degree, eventually became a master electrician and we occasionally talk (also out of politeness he doesn&#x27;t ask me to fix computers and I don&#x27;t ask him to wire things).  I always kinda wondered which of us made the right choices.  Obviously he&#x27;s richer than I am and has a more stable working environment and will have a far wealthier retirement than I will, but I am safer and healthier at my desk (or ... am I?)",1428412188

More extensive study and testing would be required to validate the method.<p>My impression is this argument is fitting data to conclusion already assumed, rather than discovering a conclusion from the data.<p>If the proposal is then to administer a sort of &quot;justice&quot; via this approach, it&#x27;s really no different than a kangaroo court.<p>Far more importantly, if some kind of analysis from rank and votes were able to identify cheats, I think those capable of doing so should really think through, go slowly, and work with HN/YC before deciding to &quot;out&quot; them.<p>Self-anointed vigilantes outside of the system almost never work as a way to create justice, because they end up wielding a power for destruction, which the community itself has not organically decided to give them. By holding power to decide who is a member of the community and who is not, without also shouldering the responsibility for building and constructing that community, they have an outsized ability to reshape the community away from the forces that built it.<p>In some cases, like when a community’s culture is so toxic to people’s common good, this kind of dramatic shift from equilibrium works as a way to restore an order more suited to people.<p>I don’t feel HN is in need of such treatment.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s likely pain if a post doesn’t get upvoted, and that doesn’t mean that there is anything that doesn’t work about HN. It also, as the article points out, doesn’t meant there is anything wrong with that post. I haven’t noticed a limit on the number of times someone can submit new stories, so if a post doesn’t succeed at first, it can always be tried again.<p>The response to the upvote-pain could be to say, &quot;What can I learn?&quot; or it could be to say, &quot;Who can I blame?&quot; I think the implicit assumption that “the HN voting system is flawed” is incorrect. For a poster it’s a compelling idea to “explain” a post&#x27;s lack of desired upvotes, because then I doesn’t have to take responsibility for ways they I have iterated and improved my post. I choose to blame an external system, in this case “the voting system.”<p>It’s a very compelling story because then whenever I post something that doesn’t get upvoted as much I want, I can say, “It’s not my responsibility, the system is flawed, and other’s successes are fake.” That can make me feel better. Except, it’s fake because I’m not actually feeling better because I created something of value, only by diminishing the value of something in comparison, and thereby elevating something which otherwise may not warrant elevation outside such straw-man comparisons. Secondly, it doesn’t work for me because then instead of learning from that experience, and iterating, I effectively reduced my learning to zero. Instead of saying, “what can I do that works?” I said, “The system doesn’t work. Now I will prove that is true.”<p>If we put all that aside and assume that the system really is flawed and a method really can identify fraudulent post elevation, then I still disagree that “outing” HN members is something which will work. Trust amongst HN members, the sort-of anonymous quality of it, even the unspoken “sacredness” of the voting system as a way of bringing us content, all contribute to social harmony here. This place has been shaped by the forces on HN and YC that sweated to build and unite it. If suddenly an asymmetric power arises outside this system that can identify cheats, and publicly outs them, this divisive force, used without the same care for the sacred harmony of community that the people who built it have invested in it, there will be a lack of harmony. This vigilante power would erode the trust and bonds between HN members.<p>It doesn&#x27;t work trying to simultaneously mend the social fabric by breaking it. The threads are the laws and the people who protect and respect them. An entity which, outside of the fragile fabric of justice, decides which members are &quot;good&quot; and which are &quot;bad&quot; is eroding the lawful links that connect people, which were decided by the gestalt. Those laws, and unspoken codes and culture, were not created by one fell swoop of a powerful tech. They were created by sedimentary deposit of 1000s of man years of collaborative time and interaction, whether on HN or in other communities. This is how these bonds are shaped and the harmony they create is precious. It works that the ones who create this order in a community, with the members themselves, are the same ones who should wield the power to exclude members to protect some values, rather than an asymmetric power self-granted to some external self-anointed &quot;authority&quot;. This seems unlikely to create harmony, because it is an external force imposed rather than one that arose and was guided skilfully by highly-invested and integrated community maintainers.<p>In this case the values to be protected are the credibility of the karma system, which is certainly an important aim. I don’t think public naming and shaming is the way that works to do so. And if it turns out it is, then it works to be based on a solid evidentiary process.",1428411889

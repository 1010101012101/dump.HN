2717665,comment,2716714,2717350,4,0,swombat,,,"Passports and social security cards are physical items. Because of this, they have the inherent property of not being capable of ubiquity.<p>If someone steals your passport, you'll know: you won't be able to find it.<p>Digital keys have no such properties. If someone steals your private key, you will have no idea until you see them steal all your money and accounts.<p>Physical items also need to be carried to a destination to be used. If someone steals your passport, they may be able to take over your bank accounts, etc. For that, they have to actually go in person to meet a bank manager and pretend to be you. People do that fairly successfully, but it's hardly an efficient process.<p>A digital passport/key, on the other hand, could be abused immediately after it's been stolen, and could be used across all your accounts within the hour, before you've even realised you've been robbed.<p>Finally, you can only use one passport at a time. Not only it takes time, but you need a career criminal dedicated to each ""process"".<p>A digital key robbery, however, requires no human element, and thus can be done in parallel at a large scale. One could use Trojans to capture the keys of a large number of people and steal their money in an automated manner without ever showing up at a bank.<p>All those problems can perhaps be solved, but they are not easy and they have nothing to do with keeping the key safe - more to do with keeping the process of using the key as inefficient as possible. The best way to ensure your digital key cannot be abused is to make sure that you can only use it in person in front of other human beings, on authorised hardware.<p>So, pretty much like the way our bank cards work, then.",1309513782

Often these lifestyles are supplied due to easy credit.<p>Sheltered poverty in the USA means studio apartment, no a/c, no car, no laundry facilities on site, dangerous neighborhood, little to no public transport.<p>You also have dirt poor poverty which people commonly refer to as ""trailer trash"", where you have communities of poor people living in trailers wasting away their lives with poor choices & poverty.<p>Then you have the destitute poor which are those that live on city streets, eat a charity kitchens & often have drug or mental health problems.<p>I will say that the poor in the USA do have it better than the poor in India, but that's mainly due access to government assistance. Often the US poor don't have money to save because they bought an A/C, fixed their car, had to see a doctor or payback a loan they took out the week before to make ends meet. That or they live with subsidized housing & utilities and are given a tiny amount of welfare/food stamps which is lucky to last to the end of the month.",1309513616

2717659,comment,2715064,2715720,2,0,jules,,,"The responses that use valid arguments (i.e. not ""it will harm your professional reputation to use tables! or tables are for tabular data! or I can bill more hours if I use CSS!"") pretty much agree that the arguments against tables don't hold much water.<p>The <i>only</i> argument that might be important against tables that I could see is that they work less well with screenreaders. Can anyone using a screen reader confirm or deny this? I could easily see it being the other way around, because with tables a screen reader will let you quickly navigate to different parts of the page (e.g. sidebar to header to main content by going left, right, up and down instead of painstakingly navigating over a bunch of text).<p>On the other hand, tables are easier to use, more flexible, more predictable across browsers, and more readable. Just look at the years and years of research it took the CSS experts at e.g. Alistapart to replicate layouts that are trivial with tables using CSS.<p>Examples:<p><a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/</a><p><a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxabsolutepositioning/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxabsolutepositioning/</a><p><a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/multicolumnlayouts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/multicolumnlayouts/</a><p><a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/negativemargins/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/negativemargins/</a><p>And even then it doesn't always work: <a href=""http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/hgjump.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/hgjump.html</a><p>Note that these layouts are utterly trivial to create with tables.",1309513477

Each team will receive 5,000 per founder (to a maximum of 15,000) for which we will accept 8% of founder shares per start-up (not per founder). We do not have any strange terms and conditions and we align ourselves entirely with the other founders of the business  effectively becoming a co-founder of the business. In addition, we provide you with office space and other services from various partners including hosting, legal and professional services etc. Subject to the teams achieving pre-agreed milestones, the balance of the 100,000 will be released in the form of a convertible loan with a discount of 20% against the next funding round. Teams are not obliged to accept the loan note at the end of the programme.",1309511563

Suddenly it takes a paltry 229 <i>thousand</i> centuries (or 22 million years) with bcrypt at 0.3s.<p>Using punctuation does not make a password ""more random"", it only makes the random choice set slightly larger. Bumping the length is much more significant than bumping the set as it's exponential.<p>The debate is whether it's easier for a user to both pick and remember a ""random-enough"" - i.e not easily bruteforce-able, regardless of hashing technology - [A-Za-z]{10} password or a [A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&()_-+=;':"",.<>/?\|[\]{}]{8} password.<p>For the record, Google's 2-factor auth generated app-specific passwords are [a-z]{16}, which gives 1E22, or 230 billion years with bcrypt at 0.3s.",1309511181

My object model may be ""contaminated"" now, but if I'm getting my work done that much faster (plus the added benefit of database vendor independence), I don't really see the downside. Perhaps if you have a really complex database model, that's one thing...but in most cases, it's not.<p>Would people do things differently if there were an adhered-to SQL standard? Probably not, since using an ORM still saves you development time since you don't need to write a bunch of fairly routine code.<p>A better solution might be to have a code-generation tool that writes the code by hand but doesn't ruin your business object model.",1257162351

Here are some ideas I would try:<p>* Can lloydarmbrust sell for an extra hour by taking a two hour lunch and spending an extra hour at work?<p>* Can lloydarmbrust sell via email during the workday (assuming he can stay on top of his regular job)?<p>* Can jnovek can do some of lloydarmbrust's work so that lloyd can get more time to sell and/or survive at his current job?<p>* Can jnovek learn to sell, at least to the point of identifying prospects? For instance, a lot of lloyd's time may be spent trying to find out the decision maker at, say, the NYTimes. jnovek might be able to offload some of that ""find the client"" work, even if he weren't comfortable enough to ""sell"" the prospect he finds.<p>Finally, $2.5k in monthly recurring sales sounds extremely low for a b2b sale that can add 5-8% to the bottom line. Have you considered raising prices by 10x? If your customer has $1 MM in revs, saving them 8% is $80k a year!

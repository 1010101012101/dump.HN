The only problem is the cable companies don't actually want that and they provide the broadband.  Interesting catch-22.",1215053906

234797,comment,234763,234763,0,0,Mapou,,,"I think the voting problem is a serious one. Apparently, only a minority of readers and posters vote and they seem to have a gang mentality that works like this: ""If I don't like you, I'll vote you down regardless of what you write."" This sucks the big one.<p>The same problem is happening on every site where voting is allowed. There is usually a loud, highly emotional and political minority with a lot of time on their hands that invariably takes over and impose a fascist dictatorship on the rest of the community. Digg, Slashdot and Wikipedia are cases in point. I wish there was a way to motivate a greater percentage of readers to take part in the voting process.<p>Another problem is that a lot of people receive updates via RSS news readers and I suspect that most go directly to the link and rarely check the comments or attempt to vote. YC needs a way to entice people to visit the site and incorporate the number of times a link is clicked to the formula that computes the popularity value of the story. Just one man's opinion.",1215053648

Regarding the 'whom' part, really it is the same as everywhere, find good developers.<p>I happen to know the Indian folks whom the author got on board his firm. They actually are 'very' good, and i guess that is the primary reason why the author is so happy at having it all figured out.<p>The point that is a bit off the mark in the article is:<p><pre><code>  Because of the fairly fluid and competitive labor market in the IT world in India right now, \n  many Indian employers don’t allow their developers to blog or make contributions to open-source, \n  for fear of losing them to competitors who might contact them directly\n</code></pre>\nI am yet to hear of any employers here not allowing open source contributions per se. I guess one of the reasons for not having as many open source contributions/technical blogs from India (sadly) is that most of the business is still 'services' and people are jammed up with unrealistic schedules (committed by their firms). Also majority of the work is Java/.NET enterprisey stuff that is not too encouraging for the people to put more efforts back in to 'that' ecosystem.",1215053259

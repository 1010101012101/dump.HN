I have nothing against that, by the way, but I&#x27;m simply pointing out that many countries like Japan are fairly xenophobic at best, racist at worst. I believe there was an article on HN recently about how difficult it is to found a start up in Japan as a foreigner.<p>Plus, I&#x27;m not sure this kind of tight-knit culture is something I&#x27;d want to be a part of: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/11/07/doing-business-in-japan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/11/07/doing-business-in-japan/</a><p>> The company is your public life.

Not the whole story.<p>It is a weak comparison. The fact that the Russian state has its roots in Kievan Rus, with the center in Kiev, is not disputed by any Russian historiography (I&#x27;m russian historian), neither Ukrainian nor Western. It is the same for Ukraine and Belarus - we all believe that our common roots lie in the Kievan Rus. Therefore, we call each other sister nations.<p>> Not that it matters much, but it&#x27;s one of the constantly repeated points of Russian propaganda - that Ukraine is a temporary state with no history.<p>It is not true. Here are _TON_ of BS from state mass media. But no one, in their right mind, would talk like that.",1446454764

You can update the values of various display elements such as meters, progress bars, and text displays from other threads.  That GUI is often used for control panels, with real-time data coming in that needs to be current on the display, which is why they made that work.<p>It&#x27;s going to be interesting to see what happens when someone implements a new GUI in Rust. The classic problem with GUIs has been that ownership management for both allocation and locking was a big problem.

He wants to constrain these conflicts by an additional feat of good behavior, just so that everyone adds an additional moral attitude to what they do or must do – at work or in the family – that leads to good works instead of evil deeds.<p>And thinking in this schema is not only a mistake, but it produces a theoretical reversal in a certain literal sense.

In a physical simulation, reaching stability in a face/face contact is common.<p>In Falling Bodies, by version 2, we went further.  GJK gave us the two closest features. From those, we took the two most parallel faces. Those faces were then projected on the plane perpendicular to the closest point vector and through its midpoint. The intersection of those polygons was computed and treated as a contact patch.  The goal was to eliminate all discontinuities in changes of the contact force vector as the objects moved, so that we never integrated across a discontinuity.<p>This was for spring/damper contact simulation, which is more realistic than impulse/constraint contact simulation, but more CPU-intensive.

The &quot;7 bit&quot; era refers to nobody actually agreeing <i>what</i> codepoints within x80 ~ xFF <i>actually mean</i>. This is even partially true today - not everything has agreed on speaking UTF8 (hi Win32 APIs).<p>On the actual point of why neither 0x0D nor 0x0A will ever &quot;manage to collide&quot;.<p>In a single-byte encoding (called codepages, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page#Noteworthy_code_pages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page#Noteworthy_code_page...</a>) 0x0D always means just that, as pretty much all ASCII-derived codepages do... well, respect ASCII ( note - this does not touch on the horror of EBCDIC, which is alive and well today (2015) too ).<p>In the case of UTF8 any continuation byte can only carry values in the range of \x80 ~ \xBF, and any leading byte can carry values in the range \xC0 ~ \xF7. So no matter how you slice and dice things, the resulting UTF8 will have every ASCII character meaning itself (this includex \x0D and \x0A ), and the only ambiguity when mistakenly treated as any single-byte encoding would be in the &quot;what do we do with the upper 7bit range&quot; part ( \x80 ~ \xFF ). More info here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description</a><p>True, other multibyte encodings are not so convenient: for example  \N{MALAYALAM LETTER UU} ( <a href=""http://graphemica.com/%E0%B4%8A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphemica.com/%E0%B4%8A</a> ) looks <i>really</i> bad CRLF-wise in both UTF16/UCS2 an UTF32.<p>But this is why UTF8 &quot;won&quot; for all intents and purposes. And this is also why &quot;escaping&quot; is not necessary under virtually any modern environment, so IRC lacking any such mechanism is not really relevant.<p>( No opinion worth sharing on the rest of the article/discussion ;)",1446453015

Climate change deniers would have a day of rejoice for being right that it wasn&#x27;t humans, and then what? Asphyxiate in cow fart.<p>It don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s humans, cows, an alien beam from outside the galaxy or the hamster people. It&#x27;s a problem, I stopped caring who&#x27;s to blame a long time ago. We&#x27;re currently going for the lowest hanging fruit (carbon emissions), which is the best approach. If tomorrow it turns out it was something different, changing that would be the correct thing to fix. Proving that humans aren&#x27;t to blame does not exempt us from fixing it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=1734"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=1734</a>",1446451689

The central bank are actually releasing new denominations of coins and notes this autumn, so we&#x27;ll have cash around for the foreseeable future.<p>As mentioned public transportation is one area where cash is commonly not accepted any more. Banks obviously encourage card payments over cash and have also been reducing the number of their own offices that handle cash. On the other hand most grocery stores in Sweden allows you to withdraw cash when you shop and charge your card. If you need cash that&#x27;s the most convenient way to get it.<p>Entirely cashless stores are quite rare. Maybe it is a bit more common in some big city locations, where the loss of the very few customers who cannot pay by card doesn&#x27;t matter - simply because the vast majority already pays with cards.<p>On a personal level I prefer card payments and it can easily pass weeks between the very rare cases where I have to use cash.<p>That said, I would really not like a cashless society if that means I cannot have any mean of traceless transactions. I want to be able to hand over money to people I don&#x27;t know or necessarily trust beyond a superficial level, without having to account for it later.<p>As for cash in the microwave oven...

10490621,comment,10488991,10489860,0,0,EdSharkey,,,"For all you detractors, here&#x27;s my story, maybe it will help you believe that quality is possible in our industry.<p>I have been doing professional software development since 1997, and from then until two years ago, I have been a developer on waterfall and scrummerfall projects.  There have been deathmarches aplenty and lots of failures small and large with some heroic successes here and there.  Overall, I&#x27;d say the performance of the teams I had been on has been fair to poor, and the code quality has been generally poor because it was always rushed.<p>Then two years ago, my manager got on a quality kick and the team was largely with him because we were frustrated with some boneheaded defects that had escaped to production.  First, we started to require some unit testing here and there, and code quality started to improve, at least to those of us on the team who noticed such things.<p>Next, we all decided on a new greenfield project that we would enforce a test-first/TDD rule.  Our code coverage was suddenly obscene!  Months later, we had no escape defects when we delivered to production on-time.  No escape defects was unheard of in our division, and a point of pride for the manager.<p>The TDD we were doing was largely just a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement, and there was little pairing.  Mainly we all still worked in our little heads-down solo developer modes.  So, manager decided to amp up the agile more.  We got TDD training (&quot;obey the testing goat&quot; video series) and we became much more open to the idea of pairing.  The QA team was fired, we ended up with one floating QE engineer.  He occasionally pairs with us, developing for real stories.  An agile coach came to visit us and gave some tips.  Got scrummaster training, bleh ...<p>On the next project, also a greenfield, we were much more confident.  Pairing happened very dependably whenever we did any new development.  We were less intent on metrics such as coverage, and more intent on writing our unit tests like they were a software spec.  Spock Framework for Java is a really nice system for doing this, our tests read almost like english paragraphs.  Our defect rate is similarly low like it was on the previous project, but now we have a much better comprehension of the code.  I feel like the whole team is communicating better and can understand the subtle design direction changes that naturally happen throughout the course of a project.  We just completed our first story mapping exercise for this project, it&#x27;s really neat to see our plans all laid out on the board like that and this has been very helpful for our product owner.<p>There&#x27;s a lot wrong with our situation, but we&#x27;re impatient to fix things since we don&#x27;t have defects to mentally burden us constantly.  A one-click build would be really nice, and our overall system design handed down to us from on-high is heavy-handed.  We&#x27;re so agile now we can usually devise a long-term plan to address our issues that everyone is comfortable with.  Our product owner is struggling to get better definition around aspects of the project, but we make it possible for him to shift directions - again because the codebase is well-factored and largely free from bugs.<p>My main observation looking back on my 18 years of coding is that software takes a long time to write.  It&#x27;s really excruciating.  Trying to turbo boost a project by overcommitting resources and doing death marches usually doesn&#x27;t shorten the actual time to delivery all that much in my estimation, but it DOES drive up the risk because people are going to fail on you left and right.<p>This excruciating slowness to develop software has only become more evident to me now that I&#x27;m on a team that is genuinely trying to be agile.  Every little feature and every task on the board is SOOOO drawn out and painstakingly developed by pairs of developers.  DevOps is a big deal that saps tons of the team&#x27;s time, but it is important for us to own this.<p>I just never thought I would see proper resource allocation to software projects, but here it is.  My company is spending the money it needs to AND the management, product owner, and developers on the team are all willing to work this way.  We took no shortcuts and focus on code quality.  Effort put into documentation is fairly lite, unless it is intended for the user.<p>I can count on one hand the number of days I was asked to work overtime in the last 2 years.<p>The question I have is, if high quality software development is possible, is it a lot more expensive than the old death march/waterfall/lie-to-ourselves-constantly style of development?  My team no longer has show-stopper production environment defects nor a QA department anymore.  Surely that has to cut our costs a lot!  We do have a dependable cadence, and have recently been seeing our velocity accelerate.  While we do meet our product owner&#x27;s goals, but I&#x27;d say our progress feels achingly slow at times.  Maybe I&#x27;m just impatient or restless.  I&#x27;ll need to ask my manager if he can gauge whether we&#x27;re more or less expensive to run than we were in the past.",1446451394

I have settled (with full knowledge of the Novell Microsoft ""agreement"") on openSUSE 10.2 for the time being and so far have been very satisifed with the results.  The Vista driven ""leave all your obsolete hardware at the end of the driveway for garbage pickup"" mentality doesn't wash.  SUSE is running just fine on an old 1Ghz Athlon.  I urge others to try some sort of current Linux distro (try more than one) and experience it firsthand.

I think we brought a great idea, a plan, and little diversity in our team (I was the only geek in our garage).  We were swiftly rejected for reasons I'm not entirely sure , but thats why they have the money and I don't!  At the least, Boston made for a great weekend getaway.",1177343127

""I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe."" ""Why is the net wired randomly?"", asked Minsky. ""I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play."" <p>Minsky shut his eyes. ""Why do you close your eyes?"", Sussman asked his teacher. ""So the room will be empty."" <p>At that moment, Sussman was enlightened. ",1177343121

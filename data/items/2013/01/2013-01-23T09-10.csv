5102325,comment,5102000,5102143,37,0,will_brown,,,"Philip let me address the three legal issues you seemed curious about.<p>1.  Non-compete clauses are not exactly ""illegal"" in California rather unenforceable.  They are put into agreements typically as boiler plate ""I agree for a period of 'x' I will not work for a company that competes with employer or start my own.""  So if you were hired in California and went to work for a competing company in California, it would be safe to say if there was a non-compete"" clause in the original contract the courts would not enforce it.  However, these are multi-national corporations so non-compete clauses can be enforceable in a lot of jurisdictions outside California.<p>2.  As it relates to the idea that Apple was trying to sign an agreement with Palm not to hire each others employees,  anti-compete is between the employer/employee not two competing companies, so the companies have the contractual right to enter into these agreements.  <i></i>*This may be a general rule, but your gut instinct is right on because there are a number of exceptions that would make agreements between competing companies illegal, for example if they had an effect of price fixing.<p>3.  Apple's approach of ""threatening lawsuit"" for patent infringement is not tactful, but not extortion either.  Laws on this point can be very strict, for example you cannot necessarily threaten lawsuit, but  Apple is within its right to send cease and desist with formal demand when it feels its patents are being violated.  Naturally, part of a demand is agreement to not pursue the lawsuit if the demand is met. It may sound like extortion, but do not forget Palm does not have to agree to the terms of the demand (Palm might not even be violating Apple patents) and Palm can always take its chances in court and even if they lost they could still hire Apple employees.",1358934843

The curious thing really is, I think ultimately I am just doing what most depressed people are doing, digging myself in further. When before trying therapy, I felt depressed and always sort-of out of place and ""wrong"", now I have no shortage of ""proof"" how broken I am, even by design/bringing up. When before, my issues were more in the here and now, it sort of spiraled into ""<i>everything has been wrong from the very start because those are the conditions I grew up under and  missed out on this,this,this etc....</i>"". A more ""sophisticated"" kind of very toxic thinking and turning in circles,in cycles, if you will. If this ultimately works for or against therapy or bettering oneself, I cannot say. So far I think it has had some things easier, understanding connections or correlations; and some things harder, like this toxic thinking.

As somebody constantly working to improve his Rails knowledge I can see I'll get a lot out of this kind of thing.<p>Secondly, again from a learner's perspective, what would be fantastic for me would be if you could see what's in the Gemfile for each project at a glance. This is because, similar to the enterprise Java world, a lot of my problem solving efforts with Ruby are spent on the plumbing of components to each other, so being able to look at well-coded examples of this plumbing would be incredibly helpful.<p>Thanks again!",1358932090

For general population though it's not something they were warned enough. They teach you how to cross a road in elementary; nobody explains you how to use privacy controls.<p>The whole liking and sharing ecosystem is promoted by social media itself. While you have skills to be critical of privacy implications, many more people have very vague idea or none whatsoever. Facebook de-facto is seen as a way of communicating with your social circle, that's why normal people join it; there is a (misguided) expectation of the same kind of privacy that you have in a clique of friends.",1358932073

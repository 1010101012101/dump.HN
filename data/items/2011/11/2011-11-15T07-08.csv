Jobs did things out of love: love for his customer, love for his products.<p>As a result, Apple was one of the few companies that self-improved with each flaw in its products. Self-improvement is hard, and it takes a lot of discipline. Jobs' screaming and shouting may have not been the best way to achieve the goal, but it worked. And until we have proof by counter-example, it may be the most efficient way to achieve the greater good.<p>Think about your own teachers or coaches. For me, the ones I remember most are not the one who always told me ""good job"". It's the teachers who fought my flaws, pushed my limits. In many cases, that involved tedious exercises, boring discipline, ""coldness"" or shouting. I have yet to see a good sports coach who is always smiling on the field and drives the team with ""good job"" during the match.<p>To me, Jobs is the best illustration of ""There's a difference between knowing the way and walking the way."" Jobs knew the way, and made others walk it.",1321343646

In other words, the prosecutor goes to the judge, presents evidence, and the judge, without hearing from the defence, decides to issue the order.<p>The 5th Amendment to the US Constitution states in part that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.  This seems to fly in the face of that.  How fast can you say ""Star Chamber?""<p>I would certainly hope that should this pass the first time a prosecutor goes to a judge with a request for this, the prosecutor strikes down this provision of the law on these grounds.  I would certainly hope that such a ruling would be upheld on appeal.<p>and there is some precedent for this.  The Third Circuit recently had a magistrate judge refuse to sign a subpoena for cell site location data holding that the request might constitute a 4th Amendment search and as such a warrant was required instead.  When appealed, the 3rd Circuit sided with the magistrate, much to Prof. Orin Kerr's surprise (on whose blog I followed this story).",1321342918

If that's true, it's worth considering if the ROI is there to make your app a single-page javascript app vs how fast you can iterate via the more standard method.  You may not have the traffic to where offloading rending to the client makes sense.  It's likely many actions your app does are ""fast enough"" as well, so a rich UI experience isn't going to be a huge improvement.  Reserving the highly interactive bits for where it really counts may be a better idea.<p>That said, it's only a matter of time before the ""harder to develop and test for"" goes away and rich apps will become more of the norm.",1321342817

If you are heading to Battlelog from a Windows PC and you own the PC version of Battlefield 3 you can launch into a game right from within the browser. How does this work? It works with the help of a browser plugin that exposes additional functionality to the in browser client. Namely it has a function to start the game and pass it information as well as a general purpose function to ping an IP address which is used for the server browser.<p>Unreal did that back in 1998. They register the unreal:// protocol in windows so any hyperlinks that contain an address such as unreal://127.0.0.1 will launch the game and connect to that ip. The good thing about this is that it can also be used by third party websites such as promoting your clans server and it is completely browser independent. I don't know if it could be abused to ""rickroll-launch"" the game but i haven't heard of any such incidents.",1321342788

Basically, there's a localized cache of information <i>just for you</i>, storing information entered by you that you might see.  Since this is a limited set and is easily sharded by user, you can put everything in memcached, have the frontends hit that record and merge it with the rest of the data, and pretty much guarantee immediate consistency - as long as it's just <i>you</i> looking at the profile.<p>When other people look at your profile, they have to go through the normal eventual-consistency mechanisms, deal with the normal replication lag and message-passing delays, etc.  But they have no idea that the information is out of date, because <i>they're not the ones who inputted it</i>.  As long as you don't go ask someone through backchannels ""did you see my FB update?"", they'll never be the wiser.<p>FWIW, I've seen data-consistency problems on my FB wall before where the same entry will appear multiple times, usually due to pagination bugs.",1321342487

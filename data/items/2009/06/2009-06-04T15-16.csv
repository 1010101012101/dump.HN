641621,comment,641294,641356,0,0,dkarl,,,"Through chronic undersleeping I've trained myself to undersleep, which leaves me groggy and vulnerable to minor colds and such.  Some days I'm so tired I avoid talking to people because I know I sound mentally defective.  Every once in a while this culminates in sleeping until noon, and having to call in sick and apologize to my boss.<p>I'm developing the discipline to avoid caffeine after 6pm and go to bed ""early"" (which right now means midnight or 1am) but sometimes it's just impossible to get enough sleep.  Last night I set my alarm for 8:30 and went to bed at 1am, but I woke up at 7:30.  Tired.  ARRRGH!  This happens more often than not.  It looks like regaining my ability to sleep is going to require a long period of diet-level discipline.  My recommendation to anyone who doesn't get enough sleep:  fix your lifestyle before it becomes ingrained in your psychology and physiology.",1244131067

While functionality comes first, I grow quickly frustrated with APIs that can't even be consistent within themselves (e.g. function doThis() and do_that() in the SAME CLASS), or APIs that are not really taking advantage of the conventions and capabilities of the language they're in (e.g. a C++ API that decides to write its own string class that <i>does not</i> add anything over the standard class).",1244130409

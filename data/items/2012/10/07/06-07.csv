Measuring productivity solely by hours in front of a screen is completely useless.<p>On the other hand, tracking hours can be really benificial too, if done correctly. I love using DeskTime.com for personal use (for company use it seems counterproductive) since it lets me easily track how much time I've spent on productive apps/web sites compared to unproductive apps/web sites.<p>Yesterday I had a great work day for example, I spent 14 hours in front of the computer screen. 11 hours of those were spent in productive apps/websites, like my text editor, FTP, terminal, API-documentation sites, CRM, admin backend etc and 1h 30m in unproductive apps/websites like Hacker News and Reddit.com.<p>I got quite a lot done, so I was really satisfied with my day. On the other hand I spent over 3 hours trying to fix what turned out to be a missing comma in a configuration file. If I had spotted the error faster I could have spent more than 3 hours less time working, while still being just as productive. If I had more experience with the things I did yesterday I could probably have done as much in half the time.<p>Just goes to show that even ""productive hours"" isn't the most important thing, the only thing that matters in the end is the results.",1349591919

Be more upfront about pricing - the ""try it free"" should have the pricing list - you're selling a financial product to people who are presumably good with money, but hiding what it'll cost in the features page.  Having a ""forever free"" plan that's severely limited (/ad-supported) will help with your initial conversion.<p>For conversion to paid subscriptions, you need to convince them that you're better than a folder on their HDD, excel for financials and their contact list/calendar on their phone.  At the very least you need to look at interop between MYOB/Quicken/CSV/whatever's the rage these days.  You can focus on how computers crash so a doc library is better, or you can add a feature (versioning, archival of email, I don't know) and use that to sell the document library.  If you're targeting the guy who's got 1 property, maybe get some boilerplate forms or checklists and put them up there somewhere.  If you're targeting the guys who have 10+ properties, focus on exposing what reports can do.  Definitely do allow users to, at the very least, download excel / other spreadsheet versions of their transactions (and if you do this, specify that you do it on the features page).",1349591316

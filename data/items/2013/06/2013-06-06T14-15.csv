I'm kind of playing Devil-advocates, but it's naive to expect your government to provide you safety, lifestyle, freedom, without having to play behind the scene - or openly fight oversea - when the rest of the World lives a completely different story.</i><p>OK, for starters, let's assume that ""national defense"" is a proper and just role for government, and even be charitable and allow that ""some"" secrecy is necessary.  Now, how does any of that argue for allowing the government to record call record for <i>everybody in the US</i>?  What is wrong with having them identify an individual, or small group of individuals, that are suspected of $WHATEVER, and then go get a warrant, and then ask for the data?  I mean, by casting a net so wide, it's obvious they're collecting a TON of data on people that aren't involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever... why should we be OK with that?<p>And that aside, to the extent that this is about the ""War on Terror"", ask yourself this: How many people in the US have ever been killed as a result of a terrorist attack?  Over <i>all time</i> the number is on the order of a few thousand.  Now every single one of those was tragic, yes, and I certainly don't want to diminish the importance of every single life... but when you look at the big picture, cancer, AIDS, car crashes, accidental slips and falls in the bathroom, accidental drownings in ones own swimming pool and  even ""being beaten to death by a cop"" outrank ""death by terrorism"" in terms of scale.  And is anybody seriously suggesting we should allow the State nearly unlimited power in the name of fighting accidental slips and falls, or drownings, or any of those things? No?  Then why should we do it for terrorism?<p>And finally, shouldn't we consider that people like Ron Paul have a point, that a lot of the hatred for the US is probably ""blowback"" as a result of our aggressive, meddlesome foreign policy?  Maybe one of the best ways to ensure security for our nation is to have a strong military - <i>at home</i> - and trade freely with everyone.  After all, it seems to be far less common for strong trading partners to attack each other.  Free trade, and less meddling in the affairs of other sovereign nations, would - IMO - be more effective at protecting us, than allowing the fracking NSA to grab call logs indiscriminately.",1370530670

I realize the value of something is not concrete at first; Twitter comes to mind. I think we all agree that Twitter plays an important role in society today, yet that was unclear a few years ago.<p>I tend to assign the values the other way around; Snapchat seems like something people get a lot of fun from (and I don't mean affairs, just friends sending each other pictures they don't want to post publicly). It's not a ""worthy cause"", but it's a moral good, possibly the greatest such thing.<p>Conversely twitter seems like a net negative; the main way it impacts me is that news organizations now seem to think it's ok to publish comments from random people as if they were news. And people in fora like this seem to think they can dismiss an idea by linking to a witty tweet about it. It's a dumbing down of discourse and I'm seeing no upside; I think I would genuinely have a better life, and be happier, if twitter didn't exist.",1370530546

5832742,comment,5831540,5832428,1,0,pyre,,,"<p><pre><code>  | Saying that porn is bad because it teaches
  | people different ways to have sex doesn't
  | make sense.
</code></pre>
This is not my intention. I actually wish that people would get over a lot of their sexual hang-ups. My thoughts:<p>1. I am against censorship.<p>2. I don't think that porn by itself dangerous to humans in some sort of Puritanical way of thinking.<p>3. My thinking is that a lot of porn out there is all about the male dominating the female, and basically just using her. Allowing young children to have access to this shapes their views on sex. The older the child, the more prepared they are to deal with this. Taken with a healthy dose of discussion from parents that aren't afraid to talk sex with their kids this might not be so bad, but a lot of parents are averse to these discussions, so the child is only left with porn as a teacher.<p>4. Porn is all about fantasy, so if you are using porn as a guide (e.g.) for anal sex, you're not seeing the prep that is needed for the scene. There are videos out there of unprotected anal sex, unprotected ass-to-mouth, anal sex where the guy just jams it right in, etc. None of these show the behind-the-scenes work that goes into making those scenes safe (anal douching, warming up rather than instance penetration, etc), or are just showing people being unsafe without any context for learning. It's not meant to be a how-to guide.<p>5. I keep focusing on anal sex because it's so prevalent in porn now vs. the past. There are many other things that could also be bad[1] (e.g. skat), but it's less likely that kids/teens will come across them.<p>6. Many women are against anal sex because of bad experiences. If teenagers start engaging in more anal sex, it could just as easily have the opposite affect on 'uptake' of anal sex: inexperienced, uninformed teenage boys attempting painful anal sex with teenage girls that then grow up with a bad view of anal sex. Or teenage girls getting painful UTIs due to unsafe practice of anal sex, and writing it off.<p>7. I'm also envisioning teenage boys demanding anal sex, and teenage girls going along with it even though it is uncomfortable and/or painful as some sort of bid for acceptance or because they like the boy (possibly not even telling the boys that they don't enjoy it because this might be viewed as a bad thing; i.e. peer pressure to grin and bear it). I'll admit that this is not really based on any evidence and I (hopefully) wouldn't legislate based on just my unfounded opinions.<p>8. I'm often found to be a contrarian. If someone puts forth an idea, sometimes all I can see are edge cases.<p>9. Most of the porn that I found as a child was relatively tame, and there wasn't such free access to video porn as there is today with the 'tubes.<p>10. I realize that a lot of this isn't at some 'sky is falling' level like many anti-porn conservatives would have people believe.<p><pre><code>  | Before the internet, teens got their hands on
  | magazines and those generations aren't damaged
  | by it either
</code></pre>
The variety of porn in the pre-Internet age was nothing compared to the variety of porn now. Sure, not everything is 'new,' but the availability has increased tremendously for non-vanilla sex acts. This could be good, bad or have no effect, but you can't claim that it's the same. Also, pictures are different than videos:<p>1. In a picture, you don't pick up on the manner-isms and general body language that you would see if you were watching the same thing in video form. E.g. you see an even starker picture of 'the woman is an object' when you watch a video of a guy berating a woman while dominating her vs. just seeing a few snapshots of the same act.<p>2. Going back to the anal sex example (yeah, yeah, beating a dead horse), seeing a couple of pictures of anal sex, you <i>know</i> that you're missing out on the full act and just seeing a snapshot. If you watch a video of anal sex from start to end, you could easily not realize all of the steps involved (before, after, in the middle, but cut out in post-production), and think that you now have a complete picture of what is involved and how it happens.<p>[1] Bad as in for health reasons in this case.",1370530276

It's worth remembering that while the initial investors in Facebook have seen amazing returns which will subsidise other investments for decades to come, those returns are only because the hype in the industry as a whole has lead other people to buy into facebook. Facebook itself has fairly low revenues and they're struggling to grow them.

(Any mode derived from comint mode is an example.)  Your Emacs is never waiting for an asynchronously-communicating external process, is it?<p>The prototypical example of a process that communicates with Emacs synchronously is when Dired forks and execs the ls command to get a directory listing. I never find myself waiting for this ls command.  The only external process I notice myself ever waiting for is the movemail program distributed with Emacs -- and that never took more than around 10 seconds (and usually a lot less) even on early-1990-vintage computers like a 386.  So I am having trouble imagining what your ""when you're trying to run two or three or more [external processes]"" refers to.<p>Parenthetically, I could eliminate the delays caused by movemail by rewriting vm-get-new-mail to use async io when it is finished like M-x man uses.  Adding threads to Emacs would not be necessary.<p>But then I have very little experience of or knowledge Windows.

Talk to people about their problems at work and take genuine interest, even when they're not a potential client. Where possible, help people out in meaningful ways and show (don't tell) them that you're smart and that their problems are important to you. You'll probably end up doing some free work this way, but you'll make friends who trust you and that's far, far more valuable. As long as you're clear that you're looking for consulting work, it'll find you eventually. Just don't belabor the point.<p>One trick of mine is to focus on selling the minimum amount of complexity. Figure out exactly the value that the customer is looking for - often times they don't know what it is. There's a saying that a person in a hardware store looking for a quarter inch drill doesn't need a quarter inch drill, they need a quarter inch hole. But more importantly almost nobody needs a quarter inch hole -- maybe they need a new shelf. If they need a new shelf, maybe they just have too much stuff. No matter what it is, get to the bottom of their problem and sell them the simplest solution with the maximum value, even if it doesn't make you any money today.<p>Also consider trying to tackle some stickier problems in well-known open source projects.

    Person := TPerson(List[0]);
</code></pre>
With generics, you would have something like:<p><pre><code>    List := TList<TPerson>.Create();
    Person := List[0];
</code></pre>
The TList<TPerson> class would be compiled at compile time and offer the same kind of type safety as, say, an array.<p>In C++ it would be something like (simplified):<p><pre><code>    template <class T>
      class TList {
        private:
          T[] elements;
        public:
          void add(T value);
          void remove(T value);
          T operator[](int index);
      };
</code></pre>
This extends to other declarations. For example, in C++ you can have generic functions. So you can have a functon max(a, b) which works on any type, for example.<p>Generics is essentially about enhancing compile-time type safety and reusing code. By giving the type system more intelligence, more checks can be performed at compile time, and code can use the same logic across multiple types instead of having to be reimplemented for each type.<p>Incidentally, Delphi has had generics since 2007 [1]. I haven't used Delphi since version 5, so I haven't tried it out, but it looks fairly similar to the generics in C#.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming#Genericity_in_Delphi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming#Genericity_...</a>",1370527926

As it is it seems that value for internet companies is not based on revenue or even potential revenue.<p>This disconnect between the money invested and the money earned completely breaks the connection you talk of - customers willing to put their money where their mouth is. Someone in the chain is paying lots of money, but it certainly isn't the actual end users or customers of most startups - often they run at a loss for a substantial period, and then they have no way to turn their free readers/users into paying ones in sufficient numbers to support their valuation or the money put in. VCs really don't care about that though, as long as they are paid more than they put in - that can easily happen if the companies are bought by larger corporations like IBM or Yahoo in the mistaken belief that the customers can be converted - the question of revenue then becomes academic as the companies are folded into a larger parent and the actual value impossible to discern.<p>It's an interesting time to be alive and an interesting market to be working in, but I do find the distortions created by massively inflated valuations and companies built just to be sold on worrying.

Have the phone set for no ring, and auto-answer.  Excuse yourself to go to the restroom.  Then, using another phone, call the phone laying on the table.  Listen to what is being said in your absence.<p>In this case (listening after the meeting has adjourned) you'd need to find a way to ""forget"" your phone, so it couldn't just be lying right on the table top.  I suppose you could pitch it in the bin, ala Cypher in The Matrix, if you could do it without being noticed.  Could be awkward if somebody found it though.<p>You could probably also build a very small, easy to conceal audio recorder using one of the voice recorder ICs meant for something like an answering machine.  Leave it in your jacket pocket, and then ""forget"" your jacket when you leave the meeting.  But the risk is that somebody notices the jacket and decides to be nice and chases you down to bring it to you.<p>Hmm... looking at one example of such a recorder IC setup, this one can only do 64 seconds of voice.   Maybe not very useful.  But you could probably use an rPi and an SD card and build something that could record significantly more.  Or use an Arduino and a cellular shield and build something you can dial into...<p>Oh, wait, looking here[1], it looks like you can get voice recorder ICs that go up to 16 minutes.   Not sure, offhand, how much supporting circuitry and power it would take for one of these things, though, so not sure how small it could be built.<p>Anyway, like I said, I don't recommend actually doing this.

I have noticed that tiny paper airplanes look cool, but are difficult to fly. When I was a kid, I remember making a paper airplane out of a giant piece of butcher paper.

It seems that, with paper airplanes at least, the most stable designs are in some middle size range.<p>Is this tiny plane less stable than more traditional ""small planes"" like Cessnas?

Stylus is a very open and flexible language, and the same statement can be written many different ways. In addition, it's not as commonly used as something like sass, so there aren't well-known conventions that have arisen. All I was doing here was trying to establish and explain a couple conventions, to make life easier and more clear for everyone.<p>In addition, someone randomly posted the documentation page for the css library here rather than the homepage.

5832442,comment,5831848,5832339,3,0,danielbarla,,,"Well, if we take historical trends as any kind of indication, not quite.  E.g. according to Google's life expectancy charts, if we take the period 1992 - 2012 (20 years), and take 3 good, developed countries (USA, UK, Canada), life expectancy has gone from mid 70s to low 80s in that period.  On average, about 1.9 years added every decade, and that would lead us to something like 84 years by 2032.  The very high numbers we're used to hearing are fairly wild extrapolations of this trend for the next 90 or so years, for newborns today.<p>Of course, the trend could accelerate, but it could also easily plateau (or even reverse in an extreme case, perhaps due to environmental influences).  Current trends don't seem to show 100-year average life expectancy before 2100.<p>* Edit: this was combined stats for men and women.  For men, you can subtract a few years, and for women, add a few.  Also, I realise I'm just linearly extrapolating the data, but it's not like the data shows some kind of exponential growth; if anything, it's flattening out.",1370527272

There has never been the kind of blanket protection of ""privacy"" that technologists like to claim applies to the internet. ""Privacy"" in that sense is a concept that largely post-dates the founding (the 4th amendment is better understood not as a privacy protection, but as a protection against the indignity and invasiveness of illegal searches).

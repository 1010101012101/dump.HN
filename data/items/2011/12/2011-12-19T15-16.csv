Think back to when you first started programming, or were otherwise involved in technology. It was near impossible to know what you didn't know. And every now and then, that ignorance gave you the belief of being more of an expert than you actually were. This area is an uphill battle of constantly being reminded how little you actually know.<p>I think it'd be dangerous to have them learn just enough without being actively engaged. It would give them the false belief of being an expert since they'd stop once they feel they have a firm grasp on the subject.<p>> They HAVE experts talking to them, or at least trying.<p>This may be the case. However, they can't tell the difference. To them, any ""nerd"" using technical jargon may or may not be an expert, and there's no way to know which. Dealing with so many unfamiliar subject areas, I'm sure they're experienced enough to know people lie. So ignoring the advice may just be a defensive measure, realizing they have no idea what's being advised or even how true it really is.<p>It's a bad situation. I don't know how to solve it, but I believe <i>trust</i> is the key quality. More important than expertise.",1324310385

The advantages of REST and JavaScript applications over the old model are not apparent until you make this mental leap. Once a person does the simplicity of the architecture becomes apparent.<p><i>Well, not so fast. Not all pages should be rendered client side. Some pages need to be indexed by search engines, and they need to be rendered on the server.</i><p>This is not a concern if you do a little browser sniffing, if you run into a search bot, you send it to a server that has a headless web-browser script on it, that pulls the content from the primary server, and delivers it to the bot as a single unified page. Further most of the major search engines are fairly far along in their ability to index client side dynamic content, some you have to give a little help with #! and such, but for the most part, search is not a valid reason to hang on to the legacy of server side views.",1324310255

If so, are you interested in taking the ""Startup Train"" to the event in 2012 from California to Austin? Here are the tentative details:<p>* This would be a one way experience. Many people leave at different times, so this is the way to get there, but you are responsible for the way back. 
* The format will be similar to ""Startup Weekend"" in a lot of ways.  Some will present their ideas and the teams will be formed into the groups before boarding the train. Food, drinks (beer?), supplies, Wi-Fi, etc will be provided. The trip will take 40 hours on the train. As a result, you will have ~ 36 hours to build new startup before you arrive to Austin!
* We will be departing from LA as that is the only straight train leaving from CA to Austin.
* We will arrive in the morning on the first day of Interactive portion of SXSW
* It is going to be fun! (I envision this to be more of a laid back atmosphere with opportunity to socialize with everyone present rather than only within your team)<p>What I want from HN community is CONSTRUCTIVE feedback (like why this is not a good idea or why you would do it), questions, suggestions in the comments here AND (if you would take a train yourself and want to know more) to leave me your email via google form below:<p>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dGRQdG52enJTMzBMdFlSU0d3ZExMb0E6MQ#gid=0<p>What do you think?",1324310152

Did you never spend significant time in Jerusalem (before they finished the separation wall)? I only spent a total of a few months in Jerusalem and saw one suicide bombing and was a few blocks from a shooting. Have you never been to the west bank? One of the two times I went to Hebron I saw soldiers shooting at...who knows? But they were shooting. If you live near the northern border or near Gaza you must have been exposed to rocket attacks at some point. The only way I can imagine you <i>don't</i> encounter violence over 25 years is if you live in a safe area and don't venture out much. Still, you must have friends or family who are exposed to violence. I find it incredible that you think it's just 'hype'.",1324310148

He was obviously motivated, responsible, and likable. He had done a lot of hardware work, and claimed to be a decent (but not top-notch) C programmer.<p>Candidate B was straight out of college, and he had a weak rsum. We suspected that he had some coding talent, but he didn't have much experience, and we had no idea whether or not he was reliable.<p>We were leaning heavily towards candidate A. He interviewed brilliantly and seemed like a good fit. Then I asked him to reverse a linked list, and he responded, ""Do you have a copy of K&R? I don't remember what kind of braces C uses for functions."" After about 30 minutes, he was still trying and failing to find a solution.<p>When I asked the same question to candidate B, he shrugged, and wrote out a correct solution without stopping to think. So we hired candidate B, and he did excellent work for us for years.<p>And this is not a one-time incident. It's amazing how many people can bluff their way through an interview without knowing how to sum the numbers in an array. Rsums are full of lies, phone screens are hard to do well, and references are hand-picked by the candidate. So I'm a big believer in coding questions.",1324310057

I'm a recovering addict and I've been to jail. Luckily I completed a treatment program that allowed me to have my record expunged. But the criminal record isn't the only thing standing in your way. There's a whole host of issues having that sort of path brings with it that aren't obvious. In my case it was the debts I incurred while addicted (it's amazing what bills you decide aren't important to pay and how you use credit when you're an addict) that ruined my credit and have forced me to do things without funding. In Duane's case I'm sure there's some sort of past following him besides his record. I'm willing to bet his former ""colleagues"" in the gang come around to try to mooch or shake him down from time to time. That's just a thought and my only evidence is my knowledge of how that world works but hopefully his old buddies really are gone forever.<p>I think the message to this story should be less about ""if a dealer can do it, so can you"" and more about trying to figure out what it really was that sparked the change in Duane ans try to apply it to other convicts, especially in the US where the prisons are overcrowded and we just don't see much of any real reforms out of prisoners who are released. They're mostly on an in and out of prison rotating cycle. Is there something in Duane's case that we can learn from to help other inmates or is Duane a special case of a guy who really did just get mixed up in some bad stuff but had no real criminal bent.",1324310014

The problem is, as an App Engine user, one is totally at the mercy of any future price changes on App Engine because it is nearly impossible to seamlessly migrate away.<p>The DNS aliases (appspotchat.com, for instance) can only point to Google, and the API does not really work well on any other platform such as AppScale. So, as we discovered, at any time in the future, one's service could suddenly cost 10x as much, and one won't really have the option to move quickly. If one intends to scale, it's better to never get into that state in the first place, and develop on AWS instead. If EC2 raises its prices (highly unlikely since computing power is increasing and costs are decreasing), one can always move to rackspace or just get a private server.<p>It's of course true that writing stuff on App Engine can sometimes require a lot less engineering work.

There are multiple problems with using the power of the ballot box, including safe districts for incumbents, apathy of the electorate, etc., but for issues on which the public can be successfully rallied, there is still real potential to leverage much smaller sums of in terms of dollars to have real influence. Also, individuals and small organizations can lobby directly, too - make an appointment with your congressional office, either locally or in DC, and sit down directly with a staff member to express your concerns. You need to be organized and prepared, but it is your right, and they do listen - it's just that the small voices often get drowned out. If you don't have money to give, use your time and knowledge.<p>A rule of thumb I've heard for the weighting of different constituent opinions is that 1 office visit = 100 letters, 1 letter = 100 phone calls, 1 phone call = 100 emails. (One email might be a million names on an online petition, I don't know.) Faxes count as letters, but both only count as above if they are (or look) personal, not a form letter. Opinions from people outside a Congressman's district don't count for much, unless they have a direct business or other interest in the district.<p>(-1 for citizens voting the laws.

I really like Zelda (I'm currently playing the last one and really enjoying it), but I'd enjoy any other games based on Zelda's principle game mechanics which the author rightly described.<p>For instance, I enjoy how the same region will evolve over time depending on where you are in your main quest. At first, it's just a road to go to the temple. But as the game progress and you get more items, you can explore it in depth and discover awesome quests/items.<p>I agree with him/her that there's really few games out there that mimics the game mechanics of zelda. Mario 64 comes close but, for instance, miss the in depth strategy and the various items. Zelda really have unique game play and it's not just about the world of Zelda.. you could create a totally different world and still copy the game mechanics.. but lots of really successful game use only a part of zelda's game play which is on what the author argue.<p>In fact, it can be summarized as Zelda being the intersection between multiple 'genres'.

3369796,story,,,1,2,jeswin,"Tell HN: Why node will win, and why you need to use it.",,"In my job as a freelance consultant, I get to review about four or five web applications in a month. Most of them are written in Java, Python, .Net or less often Ruby. I have been doing this for a few years now, and I have seen different types of challenges faced by teams while building these applications. What made me write this post is that these challenges are slowly changing in a way that most programming languages aren't equipped to handle.<p>Well, none. Except Javascript.<p>When Django or Rails were conceived, the web was less demanding. AJAX was simpler and expectations were low; if the user performs some action on the page, do a POST and refresh the relevant section of the page. Today though, an increasing number of applications have more demanding interactivity requirements. Here are some common examples.
1. Interactions which do not require connecting to the server. Such as adding new entries to a list. The transformation of the view as a result of the user action needs to be done in the browser itself. 
2. Many applications now hold contextual data in browser memory; and it may not be possible to refresh a section of the page without this data.<p>As a result, some of the logic to render the page needs to be on the client side.<p>This is where problems begin. Sizable applications start having rendering logic written in (say) a Python/Django template for the initial state of the page, and rendering logic written in JavaScript for all the client-side interactions that happen subsequently. After doing this for a while, we begin to realize that we should just get rid of the server side templates and handle rendering on the client. We could send JSON to the browser, and JavaScript handles the rendering. This may seem like an acceptable result, since we aren't duplicating any rendering code on the server and client. And the responsibilities are well divided too; server side code fetches data and client side code renders it.<p>Well, not so fast. Not all pages should be rendered client side. Some pages need to be indexed by search engines, and they need to be rendered on the server. Stuck. With a non-JavaScript framework, duplication of code is inevitable. A problem that will only worsen as the browser capabilities evolve to handle even more tasks currently executed on the server.<p>People raise some valid concerns about Node.js, such as scalability. But those aren't insurmountable, and people are working on them as you read this. Besides, if your application got to a point where those problems begin to bother you, it would be pretty easy to hire the expertise to sort them out. Some people complain about the language itself. Those are mostly little personal preferences. Most dynamic languages are have always been more or less equivalent. All of them have basic things that matter; classes, closures, lambdas. And if you know one, you can pick up another quite easily.<p>I didn't really get it a few years back when many people started talking about Javascript on the server. It was only after writing a few thousand lines of code with Node that I began to realize that this is a very fundamental shift. It wasn't about Javascript the language at all. It was about Javascript the platform. Write Once, Run Anywhere.<p>Javascript is the language of the web. You should evaluate it for your start up.",1324307337

Im probably missing a whole bunch but...""), he is nevertheless very quick to make sweeping pronouncements. And he defines the Zelda subgenre more or less recursively; to be like Zelda is to be Zelda-like in ways X, Y, and Z.<p>Through it all, the primary conditions for being like Zelda seem to be: a) to have been noticed by the author in his game-playing travels, and b) to have passed the author's retroactively applied taste test.<p>All of this is a shame, not because the author gives short shrift to every Zelda-style game out there, but because he does so to <i>Zelda itself</i>. Given his passion for the series, he could have written a very insightful dissection of what makes it work. Why is Zelda so revered, so timeless, and so enchanting? These are questions the author seems overly equipped to handle, and their answers would make for a very interesting post (or series of posts). I, for one, would love to see him take a deeper dive into the mechanics, psychology, mythology, setting, and style of the series. Relieved of the burden of proving a categorical declaration, he could instead focus his energies on a lively study. Rather than talking about what makes Zelda an exception, he could talk about what makes Zelda exceptional.",1324307046

In summary it is basically this:<p>As people of power in a position to make important decisions it is their PROFESSIONAL. ETHICAL. DUTY. to know all the facts that pertain to the situation. At no point is it our fault to not understand their system in its entirety but it IS their fault to be making conscious decisions that effect people and systems they do not entirely understand.<p>As an engineer it boggles my mind to see someone weighing in on an issue they haven't rightfully studied before attempting to tackle. If there is a project I'm asked to assist on and I'm not confident I can work with my current level of knowledge> I tell my employer and I either get reassigned or scheduled for training. There is no faking it in my industry, why should they be allowed to fuck everything up because they were willfully ignorant.<p>It goes past that though. They HAVE experts talking to them, or at least trying. The engineers, architects and experts that practically founded the internet have weighed in on how this is a bad idea and yet THEY'RE IGNORED! Don't pretend like this level of ignorance and pure negligence is acceptable for one minute because it just shows how complacent people have become with their representatives.<p>/rant",1324307024

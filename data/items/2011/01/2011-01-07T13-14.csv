May be I'm wrong but, the main problem for me was to access the current instance of a class.<p>1st level : use this
2nd level : var self=this; then use self;
3rd level : var sefl=this; and pass self as parameter.<p>Typically, when a new view appear, I load dynamically the resources nee: other javascript files and an HTML template file. I use jquery to handle AJAX.<p>Here is some code:<p><pre><code>    ConsumptionView.prototype.show = function(){
        var self=this;

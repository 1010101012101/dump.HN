When I was there, there were two and a half people working full-time[0] just on OkTrends (two engineers full time, and one founder part-time).<p>I can&#x27;t give an average time per post, but to give you an idea, &quot;The Real Stuff White People Like&quot;[1] was predominantly my work[2], and it took almost two months, from start to finish.<p>If you&#x27;re wondering why it took so long to create that, remember that we started each blog post as a blank slate - at most, we had a vague question that we wanted to explore, and it took several iteration for us to hit upon anything closely resembling the analysis that you&#x27;d end up seeing in one of the OkTrends reports.<p>It might be easy to create something if you have a specific destination in mind at the start, but the key to making OkTrends posts work was <i>not</i> having a specific result in mind - instead, letting the journey guide the process.<p>Anyway, I left to go back to school, and around that time, the other engineer on the data team started having to do more internal data work on top of the OkTrends research (he stayed at OkCupid for over a year after I left, but he&#x27;s since moved on as well). That&#x27;s what caused the slowdown in the posts during late 2010 to early 2011, not the sale to Match.com. As noted below, Christian is working on other projects as well, which have unfortunately left little time for OkTrends.<p>It&#x27;s very unfortunate that the timing makes it look like Match.com put the kibosh on OkTrends, because that&#x27;s not at all what happened, though I definitely see why people would make that mistake.<p>[0] By &quot;half&quot;, I mean that we two engineers spent close to all of our time working on the data/stats, and the founder spent about half his time working with us on the projects and writing the posts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-real-stuff-white-people-like/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-real-stuff-white-peopl...</a><p>[2] I did the stats/munging/research - none of the writing.

Apart from starting a small instance, once you move pass the $100 mark per instance you are much much better off with a dedicated server. With OVH you could even start with $60 or $80.<p>That is why i am always looking for a Hybrid, a company that offers dedicated model while providing Cloud / VPS hosting. However i have yet to see a single company that does it with a price competitive option. SingleHop offers that but at a relatively expensive price. Hivelocity does very good dedicated but their Cloud / VPS sparknode gets no love.\nLimeStone Network and Incero are bothing testing their Cloud. While OVH still have absolutely no idea what it is doing although they think they do.<p>Back to DO vs Linode\nI am still skeptic of DO. After all their problems with VM Data Left over, Backup, Data Loss etc. I still think they are more of a Beta services compare to Linode, which is rock solid. Apart from the hacking issue Linode had.<p>Linode offer much better CPU performance then DO at all level. And with SSD (cache?) they should be competitive with IO in 2014 Q1. The thing that i dont understand is Linode decide to have SSD + HDD solution, where 500GB HDD + 500GB SSD works together. I dont get how this solution is better then just 500GB SSD alone.<p>Linode are also much better with Bandwidth and Network. This could be just that DO have growth problem where their user base exceed their DC bandwidth. But in general Linode&#x27;s Network are much better tuned.<p>Support is also better at Linode.<p>So basically Linode is better, but more expensive. I remember Linode does offer daily price based where they charge their client a full Mouth price and then refund it to their account on a per day basis.",1389243415

7028843,comment,7028714,7028714,7,0,thaumasiotes,,,"I have seen it said that mathematicians break down into analyst types (calculus) and algebraist types (algebra).  The difference in approach is usually described along the lines of &quot;in analysis, you have an object under study and you want to describe how it behaves in some sort of limit condition.  You have a mental model of the problem and you work to formalize what your intuition tells you&quot; vs &quot;in algebra, you have an object under study and a set of rules.  You apply the rules in a mechanical manner until you produce an interesting-looking (or desired beforehand) result&quot;.<p>Under such a worldview, my personal view of the mental requirements of a simple CRUD type of task is that the ability to apply definite rules called for in the &quot;algebraist&quot; approach is closest (and extremely necessary).  I&#x27;ve read many comments that beginning programmers can have a hard time understanding that the computer will do exactly what you tell it to do, and nothing else; applying algebraic rules is a very similar concept.<p>Geometry is an unpopular choice in your poll, but I think it has some of the same flavor of recognizing that &quot;by labeling this complicated term &#x27;x&#x27; and this other complicated term &#x27;y&#x27;, we can transform the current state of the problem into exactly the preconditions for theorem T&quot; that I&#x27;m thinking of.<p>Anyway, overall I vote for algebra 1.",1389243333

7028816,comment,7028441,7028441,2,0,lifeformed,,,"This is all true, and is similar to the #1 advice that I give to aspiring indie devs, which is to make a tiny game.  Like, something that can be finished in under a week.  I can guarantee they won&#x27;t finish it in time - it&#x27;s a lesson in scope.  You spent half of the time debugging some physics bug for that puzzle platformer idea?  Yup.  You spent a whole day working out some UI quirk?  Yep.  No, those ideas are all too big: you have to scope down to a Tetris clone to finish on time.<p>Regardless of if you finish in time, you should still finish it.  A finished bad game is a million times more impressive than an unfinished cool idea.  You gain priceless knowledge and experience from just completing a project from beginning to end, so do it often - and of course the easiest way to do that is to just make a tiny, finishable project.<p>Once you make a tiny game, make a slightly larger one.  Once you get to a multi-month project, you&#x27;ll encounter the dreaded motivation gap.  It&#x27;s when the honeymoon period of &quot;holy crap I have so many ideas&quot; wears off, and you actually have to implement every detail.  During this phase you will HATE working on the game, and if your life doesn&#x27;t depend on it, then you will quit.<p>This gap separates people who like the idea of having made a big game versus the people who want to actually make a big game.  I&#x27;ve seen so many people start so many cool projects, but never get over that hump because it&#x27;s soooo unmotivating to do something you hate, making no visible progress, for the sole prospect of &quot;it will be cool after I trudge through this another 5 months&quot;.<p>Once you get over that hump though, it gets super exciting again, because the end is in sight, and you&#x27;re just polishing the game and adding in the cool features that were in your mind before, but couldn&#x27;t add yet because the framework wasn&#x27;t there.  The only way past that hump is to have a really inspiring team that can inspire each other when they&#x27;re down on motivation, or to have inhuman Carmackian drive, or to have your life depend on it.",1389242560

7028803,comment,7028411,7028411,6,0,bushido,,,"After rewriting my response 3 times I decided to lay out some basics.<p>basics<p>-----------<p>a. The most common fallacy in investing is that higher risk equates to higher returns.<p>b. Any half decent investment strategy should have a solid risk management strategy, should account for (and discount) inflation and should have a strategy in place to emulate dollar cost averaging (most commonly by scaling into investments from a cash position or using a re-balancing strategy). Risk management (and discipline to follow it, being the most important).<p>c. Different sources of returns are taxed very differently, for example: most non-govt interest income is taxed at the marginal tax rate, so if you&#x27;re at 30% tax rate, 5% interest is actually 3.5%.<p>Then to be safe deduct the inflation, if the inflation is 2%, the real rate of return is 1.5%.<p>d. The next thing to consider is the goal of return. Is it geared towards income or growth(compounding).<p>e. If you are looking at percentage return it implies that you want growth. But that may not be the case. If you instead want an income of $50000 the whole situation changes, even though the value is the same. Simply because, if your investment loses 10% value now your 900k requires a 5.555% return to net the same $50000. I have seen and know a lot of people who went bankrupt for not understanding this, the bigger problem is I know more financial professionals who don&#x27;t understand the distinction.<p>example scenarios<p>--------------------------------<p>1. If the goal is income, the strategy should be funneled to account for recessionary periods, market corrections etc. I can explain a funnel in more details on request.<p>2. If its for growth and you want to get a higher return with lesser risk a leveraged risk reduction strategy can be employed. Can explain further on request.<p>3. For people older than 45 (preferably older that 55) an Insured Annuity is also an nice option when Income is the goal. Even better if they are not healthy (higher mortality risk, higher return).<p>Before doing anything a good amount of reading(books) would be ideal, start of with:<p>a. The richest man in Babylon(fiction) - read first, no particular order after this<p>b. The Ivy Portfolio<p>c. The intelligent asset allocator<p>d. The permanent portfolio<p>e. The Investor&#x27;s Manifesto: Preparing for Prosperity, Armageddon, and Everything in Between<p>f. Value Averaging",1389242365

Yet this never seemed to happen when I walked around with a bit of an angry look in my eye, like I had been having a bad day and was just waiting for someone to start something. I even informally experimented with it, sometimes approaching people in a cheerful, happy way, and other times approaching them like I was in a really bad mood. Men seemed to treat me much better when I was faux-pissed, and much worse when I was in a good mood. The authors didn&#x27;t experiment with this (that I could tell), but I&#x27;d hypothesize that males have the same reaction towards happy expressions in other males - they don&#x27;t like them and it initiates aggressive tendencies.<p>*You might ask why I was getting into fights in the first place, and all I can say is that high school and college are rough and most of the population doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sophisticated as the typical HN reader.",1389242163

As you can imagine, Iwata became increasingly annoyed with answering the same question over and over. He slammed critics who claimed that Nintendo couldn’t survive as a business unless they embraced online gaming as the future.<p>“All the talk in the industry regarding online gaming has been misleading. Network swindlers have made it seem like companies can’t survive in this business without network compatibility,” said Iwata. “That’s the same type of rhetoric people have been saying about the newspaper business, that the paper-based periodical business will be dead in three years. In reality, the number of users willing to pay a monthly fee for online games is small. Many of the American companies who were focusing almost exclusively on network games last year now view network capabilities as an advertising tool. The fact of the matter is, network games can’t provide a stable source of profit for a company of Nintendo’s scale.”",1389241174

Let MS and Sony squabble over the hardcore gamers, Nintendo would go after the other 80% of the population. The strategy worked amazingly well.<p>The problem is, they didn&#x27;t capitalize on it. A lot of people with a Wii didn&#x27;t buy much software. The Wii had no real online component, despite being released a few years after the introduction of Xbox Live. Over the lifetime of the Wii, Nintendo appears to have learned basically nothing about online services. Sony & MS kept improving their online experience.<p>The Wii had the ability for downloaded games, but it didn&#x27;t work that great. They were oddly tied to the console, and that was never fixed. Meanwhile it worked great for Sony and MS.<p>But years later, when the WiiU and 3DS came out... they had the same problems. Games tied to hardware (not accounts), terrible online components. They don&#x27;t have the success to draw in third parties (on the WiiU), so they&#x27;re having serious problems. That&#x27;s four generations running of poor 3rd party support.<p>And they seemed to learn the wrong lesson from the 3DS. They  tried something interesting with the Wii, and it worked pretty well. They tried it again with the 3DS, and it&#x27;s basically failed. Even Nintendo is making games that don&#x27;t use 3D. So when the WiiU came... it was full of new (and expensive) gimmicks. So the &#x27;just games&#x27; console cost most of $400.<p>Sony, on the other hand, actually learned from the PS2 and PS3 and simplified. They didn&#x27;t try to cram new exotic hardware in the console, and that made it easy for 3rd parties and cheaper to produce.<p>I don&#x27;t think Nintendo will ever recover on the WiiU. I hope they can last long enough to fix things for the next generation.",1389240240

Some people think it can be hacked/gamed, but --if that&#x27;s the case so can any normal election - and a lot of times republicans will do anything they can to get people not to vote because the more voters that show up, the more likely they are to fail.<p>I really like the idea of Liquid democracy -- what if a new political party popped up, and the runners agreed to take a public poll before every vote and the party can choose to keep or throwout the candidate at the next election based on how often they side w/ the people.<p>Throw in location/regionalized grouping, and you can easily have all sw ohio voters contribute to reps vote tally from that area...etc..<p>Also what if we raised the bar on representation - We currently have 1 congressmen per million... that&#x27;s highly not representative.. -- true representation needs to also find a way to not only represent locations...but also demographics better..<p>What if we just tripled the reps, but required 1/3rd come from middle class, 1/3rd from lower-class, 1/3rd from upper class.<p>It would provide a better idea of what the people really want from all levels.",1389240168

And given that copyleft requires the source code to be open, it can&#x27;t be used with proprietary projects (which of course permissively licenced code can), but that is by design as copyleft exist to give end users the rights which proprietary software typically removes.<p>>and makes an assumption about removing road blocks from using open source projects.<p>And I pointed out the assumption is flawed since he (dragonwriter) talked about &#x27;contribution&#x27;.<p>Saying that a lot of &#x27;entities&#x27; are happy to _use_ permissively licenced code is not the same as them _contributing_ code under permissive licences.<p>> I merely stated that the claim made by dragonwriter actually factors into my decision to use permissive licenses.<p>And I merely pointed out that there are other factors than &#x27;maximising code use&#x27; which developers may consider when licencing their code.<p>Oh, and I&#x27;d like to take the opportunity to thank you for Wingo, really like it!",1389240080

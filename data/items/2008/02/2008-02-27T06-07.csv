Two finger tap: since there's no 'right click' (which is CTRL-click on a Mac) the two finger tap means I don't remove my fingers from the pad to get a context menu.<p>2. Two fingers to scroll.  Very handy on web pages and it works up/down and left/right.",1204095579

Yahoo Mail has almost 15x the customers, and over half of the web mail market.<p><pre><code>  http://weblogs.hitwise.com/leeann-prescott/051007.png
</code></pre>
My favorite quote, in reference to email services, ""when Google made its move, Yahoo! could not compete."" If being unable to compete means having a 15x userbase (some of whom are paying you, unlike your competitor, who has only free customers) then I sure hope every business I ever run cannot compete.",1204095182

I'm using it at one of my clients where there was resistance to doing anything other than keeping a list of TODOs on a bit of paper on someone's desk.  FogBugz is _very_ easy to use for almost everyone and it has replaced the bit of paper, and (surprise, surprise) the team has suddenly discovered that they have better visibility into what they are doing.",1204094654

To comment on the article on readwriteweb I need to<p>a) scroll all they way to the bottom,<p>b) need to create an account or type other boring details like my name and email address<p>c) potentially wait for approval (it's not exactly clear if I need to wait for approval, which fields are required, etc)<p>d) have another site to check to see replies to my comments,<p>e) discuss an article in a boring, non-hierarchical comment structure (how do I see who is replying to me, how do I reply to someone else?)<p>f) miss out on the interesting/insightful replies and comments of my peers on HN (specifically in reply to one of my comments)<p>You certainly might not like having to come here to check for comments to your post, but understand there are no incentives for HN users to post their comments somewhere else.

124571,comment,124316,124526,0,0,gruseom,,,"Jerry Weinberg told a story about how IBM used to send him around to their most expensive projects. He would report back about which ones deserved further investment and which were hopeless and should be killed. Usually they took his advice, but there was one he couldn't get them to kill no matter how hard he tried. This was a project to create an ""automatic debugging machine"". The executives were too enthralled by the diagram the people on the project had drawn for them: a box with an arrow going into it saying <i>program with bugs</i> and an arrow coming out the other side saying <i>program without bugs</i>. (At this point he was met with incredulous laughter and insisted it was true.) Although they had sunk millions of dollars into this with nothing to show, the executives had been so burnt by <i>programs with bugs</i> that they refused to give up the idea.<p>At long last, Weinberg said, he finally came up with the argument that got the project killed. It went like this. ""Say you have an automatic debugging machine. I could feed it a blank sheet of paper, and out would come the program I wanted. So you'd have to have a mind-reader in there!""",1204093960

Millions of soldiers were captured.  Hitler gave the order to summary execute all commanders and communist members found in each unit.<p>Meanwhile, Stalin, pissed at the poor performance of its army, gave order to execute all the commanders who retreated, or their units gave up to the germans.<p>Giving up, ment certain death, retreating ment execution, so the red army commanders; from simple captains, to even generals, were left with literally one choice:  Fight to their death.<p>At the end, we all know who won the war.",1204093516

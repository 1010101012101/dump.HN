4182877,comment,4180979,4181465,5,0,liuliu,,,"Personally, I am a little frustrated by OpenCV's move to C++ interface. Yes, it looks like a high-level language by mimicking Matlab style. But at the end of the day, the implementation uses many advanced C++ features, and ignored one thing that C++ is really good at: abstracting to objects / object interactions.<p>Computer vision task is very different, from, for example, a game engine. From engineering perspective, computer vision tasks are very functional. You throw an image to it, get some semantic information out of it, and done. The only objects there are images, and it is boring (Really? You need a inheritance relationship between different <i>type</i> of images? Tell me what's the behavioral difference!). Thus, object-oriented style is not the best abstraction for this kind of task at all. However, C++ is all about object-oriented programming! (and it is really useful for game engines, where you actually have a lot different objects and interacting with each other).<p>(Then here is the question, how to support different types of image? From the people I talked with, it seems to me the general conscious is to use generated code no matter you use c or c++. Generated code can be type safe, and still very fast. Effectively, this is what template does for OpenCV and macro does for ccv, although, both approaches are not the best.)<p>Take the end result, it is easy to use OpenCV's new interface (if you are familiar with Matlab), but hard to hack in. OTOH, it does provide quite a lot algorithms for you to experiment with, but then, if you need to write something new (the end goal of experimentation after all), it is really not an easy undertaking.<p>ccv takes a different path.

Unfortunately, like every other low-level crypto library, the MSDN documentation does an appalling job of showing how to write a secure cryptosystem. Blame the docs, blame Microsoft, blame the developer, but this program gets a bunch of things painfully wrong.<p>By way of bona fides and to start this off: I'm pretty sure that using PBKDF2 to generate the key <i>and</i> the IV for AES-CBC is broken; it produces a deterministic repeating IV for every message encrypted under a given key. Had the default mode for AesManaged been CTR, or had the developer chosen CTR mode, this would be a devastating problem; it would mean attackers without knowing anything about the key or even the encryption method could, in seconds, discover that CTR mode with a repeating nonce had been used <i>and decrypt the messages</i>. Fortunately, since the .NET default is CBC, it just subtly weakens the cryptosystem instead of killing it.<p>Why-oh-why derive the IV from the key? An idiom in modern cryptosystems: generate a random block and tack it to the front of the message.<p>Do you want to entrust your secret messages to developers who get this wrong? Only if you want to do that developer a favor. It's fine if you do, but I recommend trusting your real secrets to GPG/PGP.<p>There are significantly worse problems with this library (at least, I think; I read it for just a few minutes).

I've been a situation were the MCSE guru was unable to resolve a windows problem and me as the UNIX guru solved in a minute using common sence and understanding computers.

HR interviewed me first and there attitude was so sucking even saying I dont see why somebody your age should be paid this amount.  i then had te technical interview with the person who was the manager for the job and his contractor and blew them both away with my skills that they offered me more than I was asking for.  I turned them down just becasue the HR department pissed me off that much.  So Brown and Root engineering, you missed out there.<p>Sadly HR have grown and so have a whole generation of IT managers who don't know IT or can use word and think that is knowing IT.  These sadly have no clue and will look at a CV for certs.<p>Bottom line if they need certs then generaly they are not a company that you want to work for and if they dont demand certs and do proper technical interviews/screening, then they are the ones you want to be working for.  Anything else is extra crap/stress you will never be paid to endure.<p>Remember that there is only one real certification that carry's any real weight and needs to be respected and that is the certification of sane and insane.

Quotes get acquired by market leaders over time.<p>Why do I say it wasn't Orwell? Because <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=everything+else+is+public+relations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=everything+else+is+public+re...</a> produces no source, just a plethora of (extremely recent) attributions. Similarly with Google Book Search. If you go back to 2003 you can see variants of the quote being attributed to David Brinkley (<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?ei=5WjvT-6JKsrgqAGi9cCFBA&id=VydZAAAAYAAJ&&q=%22everything+else+is+public+relations%22#search_anchor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?ei=5WjvT-6JKsrgqAGi9cCFBA&...</a>). Changing wording is a tell-tale sign of misattribution, by the way, because when quotes are severed from any canonical text they become free to evolve.<p>Probably the OP got the misquote from goodreads.com because that's the top result Google gives for it, and the OP links to the goodreads.com entry for Orwell (though not to the quote).<p>There are many more and much older citations for the Northcliffe quote you mention, though the original source is apparently lost in time, or at least lost to 5 minutes of googling.<p>I find it interesting that the quote hopped to Orwell instead of to Rupert Murdoch. Almost by definition, there are only a few possibilities for any hop. Murdoch is the natural inheritor of the social category (press baron) but Orwell is the more natural heir to the content. But by being attributed to Orwell, the quote acquires an ethical connotation it didn't have before. Now it's of a piece with ""speaking truth to power"" and ""comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable"" (<a href=""http://mikeswritingworkshop.blogspot.com/2010/03/comfort-afflicted-and-afflict.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mikeswritingworkshop.blogspot.com/2010/03/comfort-aff...</a>), which I doubt Lord Northcliffe would have endorsed as his mission.<p>That's probably also why ""advertising"" flipped to ""public relations"" in the phrasing. Advertising is legitimate in a newspaper while public relations is sinister. So these things undergo semantic hops as well.<p>This would be a good one to email to the masked detective at <a href=""http://quoteinvestigator.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quoteinvestigator.com/about/</a>.",1341090192

Well, an employee who would have done exactly what Charles did without playing Space invaders would have been a better person to hire...and that is my point.<p>Well yeah. I think you're the one missing the semantics here.<p>Part of the point was that Charles <i>was</i> working for quite a bit longer than his supervisor thinks he did. Besides the space invaders (Which was poor form, and something I would never dream of doing on an hourly wage.) he was in fact <i>planning out the program.</i> (See the time spent scribbling notes.) It just didn't look like it because he wasn't creating a huge fanfare surrounding the process. Alan jumped right in with some hazy OOP sketches and sort of ""hacked it out by committee."" as he went along.<p>He's lazy because he thought about the problem instead of doing the ""straightforward"" OOP, headache inducing four module style design favored by Alan.",1341090149

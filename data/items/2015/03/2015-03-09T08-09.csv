Homeowners can use BuildZoom to see a contractor’s complete history based on their building permits, and hire them directly through the site if they want.<p>The core of our site is a hiring system.

2) We have to know who the really good GCs are, and be extremely careful about keeping bad ones off our platform.
3) We need to get contractors, many of whom are not that comfortable with the Internet, online and into our messaging platform.
4) We need to do a really good job of gathering detailed feedback from homeowners after the job, so we know who to send future leads to.<p>We have around 100,000 registered contractors, which helps with problem number 1.<p>In addition to the hiring system, we have profiles of every licensed contractor in the country, each matched to their work history based on building permits.<p>Some other cool parts of BuildZoom:

Absolutely, and of course that would also be quite wrong. And I am sure that&#x27;s a thing that happens sometimes, unfortunately.<p>I only mentioned it because the poster I responded to had said, &quot;I&#x27;m sure that as a heterosexual man, regardless of my financial circumstances, no one could coerce me into giving blowjobs&quot; and I thought it important to say that there are different dynamics involved there.<p>If a male boss tried to coerce a male employee into sex, the male victim would be much more likely to respond with physical force, so it&#x27;s less likely to happen in the first place. The male victim would also be more likely to be viewed as unambiguously victimized, whereas in a male-on-female situation there&#x27;s likely to be a lot of <i>well, she probably wanted it</i> type speculation and/or congratulation of the male aggressor.<p>In some senses it might even be more difficult for a male victim. A male victim might be viewed as &quot;weak&quot; for letting it happen in the first place. Whatever the case I&#x27;m sure we can agree that it&#x27;s quite a different dynamic, so the original poster&#x27;s <i>well, as a man, I&#x27;d never let this happen to meeee</i> is not really a useful road to travel down.",1425890697

I agree with a ton there.<p>But the article&#x27;s author has a huge blind spot - if you search the article for &quot;tax&quot;, you will see just a couple of occurrences, and the author basically dismisses the mechanism.  It&#x27;s almost as though the author had no idea how the state even gets money - the author just thinks the state&#x27;s role in innovation is underplayed.<p>That may be true, but the size of the state depends (obviously) on the size of the economy.  It&#x27;s obvious that if the state invests in innovation that causes a 1000x rise in productivity, hugely increasing the size of the economy, then the state also becomes larger, through the usual mechanisms.<p>Taxes are how anything is socialized - the author almost behaves as though the state&#x27;s money comes out of nowhere.<p>Another good example of applying the title incorrectly would be public education.  People generally go to elementary and high school for free.  They can then go off to work, sometimes even founding companies, which they could never do if they&#x27;re illiterate.  You could consider education a &quot;risk&quot; on these entrepreneurs: not everyone who becomes literate can create a ton of value in private enterprise, either as a founder or someone working for a good salary at a company; but nobody needed to take a risk on these people in elementary school (with 10 years+ until payoff), the state does it.  In fact it&#x27;s mandatory.[1]<p>So could we say, &quot;We have socialized the risks of education but privatized the rewards?&quot; (in that you&#x27;re a free person who is now educated.)  Well, yes.  But who pays for all that public schooling - everyone does.  The author perhaps fails to see the relationship between a state causing an increase in society&#x27;s private benefits - and the fact that that the state is in a position to do so due to the latter.<p>All the state is, is a percentage of the economy, which is public.  It has a good and important role - but that role comes from being a percentage.  The Thatcher quote is appropriate: &quot;The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people&#x27;s money to spend.&quot;  That never happens if the state remains 20%-30% of the economy.  The size of the economy can simply increase indefinitely.<p>It&#x27;s not possible (which may surprise the author) for this to happen in a way that doesn&#x27;t cause the state to also increase in size.  So while I agree with the main contention, it bears pointing out that it is a two-way street: private enterprise (and private citizens) get &#x27;free&#x27; public goods from state spending, that they don&#x27;t have to pay for.  But the state gets a &#x27;free&#x27; percentage of all private enterprise (and private earnings) - in fact, set at whatever it wants.  The state can literally tax whatever level it wants and in whatever ways it wants.<p>So it is, in fact, a two-way street.<p>[1] see compulsory education - since the 1800&#x27;s, &quot;Fines were imposed on parents who did not send their children to school and the government took the power to take children away from their parents and apprentice them to others if government officials decided that the parents were &quot;unfit to have the children educated properly&quot;.&quot;",1425890347

Microsoft can demand new firmware features because that&#x27;s a one-off cost per new platform. Hardware features cost per unit, and if they push that too far it&#x27;s cheaper for manufacturers to tell Microsoft to fuck off and market their hardware without the Windows sticker.

Then, like most people, I assume, the question that springs to mind is: how can that happen? It violates a lot of assumptions we have about civilized society.<p>One way of making sense of it is determining that an unlawful act wasn&#x27;t committed. Then, yeah, you can&#x27;t call the cops, it&#x27;s not &quot;really rape&quot; (according to the law), and it&#x27;s terrible because there&#x27;s no recourse without destroying one&#x27;s career.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what happened to the OP. Just explaining why the definition of rape matters. If it was legal rape, then we&#x27;re left wondering even more why going to the cops wasn&#x27;t an option. If it wasn&#x27;t legal rape, then it&#x27;s much more difficult.<p>(And in case my writing wasn&#x27;t clear, I&#x27;m suggesting that a $500 bar tab could be called a mugging, if you didn&#x27;t willingly pay for it. But the law wouldn&#x27;t consider that a mugging. So if someone meant a colleague pulled a knife on them repeatedly, then yeah, the response is &quot;what about the cops&quot;? Whereas in the bar tab scenario, I can &quot; see the issue &quot; of no recourse. Same way that you might sleep with someone because you felt you had to, but the law wouldn&#x27;t consider that a rape.[1] I&#x27;m not saying this is what happened to the OP, at all, just responding to your questioning of why HN would discuss the definitional aspects.[2])<p>1: This is further aggravated by some people thinking rape is over claimed, perhaps in response to other people suggesting that two drunk people having sex means they taped raped each other. And by extension, that means people on permanent medication, who are never &quot;sober&quot; are always being raped. Totally unrelated to the OP, yet a driver of rather useless discussion.<p>2: And I probably am terrible for saying this, but I just don&#x27;t tend to empathize with such stories much. The huge amount of suffering in the world overall (let alone the disgusting implications of MWI) has numbed me. Plus the situation described is not very relatable to me. While I experienced the outrage when personal (eg when something happened to my daughter), other accounts tend to provoke a more... distanced reaction. Having nothing to contribute or say regarding the actual problem, I&#x27;ll respond to branching topics like yours. Terrible as that is, perhaps that&#x27;s another explanation for the type of discussion you find here. And I&#x27;m probably not the only guy on HN with similar feelings, maybe.",1425889245

By that I mean: why would the Japanese be more afraid of a Soviet invasion than an American invasion?  I know that Japanese soldiers had been trained to believe that Americans would retreat in the face of Japanese force, and that the Japanese had a pretty negative experience in dealing with the Soviet military.  But I&#x27;d think that by the end of the Pacific war the Japanese would have been keenly aware of the fact that the Americans were not running away - they preparing to invade the homeland.<p>The only way I can logically fit the Soviet angle in is if Japan thought that they might be able to divide the Allies with a Soviet peace treaty.

The API is documented on github at <a href=""https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb</a>.<p>There is definitely overlap between Digital Poetry and Poetry Technology. However as the name suggests, Poetry Technology is more than the resulting instances of poetry. It is as much, if not more, about the technological process and mediation.<p>Digital Poetry is perhaps more apt as a marketing label to a consumer (just as we might say, “I like listening to electronic music”). From the point of view of a practitioner, my objection to Digital Poetry as a label is that it is two dimensional, and casts poetry technology as a variant of existing poetry, whereas this is misleading.<p>Digital Poetry, unfairly or not, is not on the whole viewed too seriously by the literary establishment. It is considered to be gimmicky and perhaps even a failed attempt to achieve “serious” or mainstream literary work. Poetry Technology aims to set that right, by drawing attention to the technology, the process, the body of knowledge that it draws from, the theory that can inform the practice and application, the potential works that could be created. It is much more than a label.<p><i></i>*<p>Your markup project sounds intriguing.

The only justification for the fire bombings and nuclear bombings that has any possible merit is that they were necessary to end the war. However, the US never even tried to negotiate, nor did they try to communicate to the Japanese that they would be willing to allow the Emperor to remain nominally in power. They could have used that to end the war far sooner.<p>So how could the bombings possibly be necessary to end the war when the war might have been ended by other means? I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll say that that wouldn&#x27;t have worked, but how would you know? The lack of any attempt shows that the US wasn&#x27;t interested in ending the war: they wanted revenge, and therefore the bombings were not justified.",1425888068

Back to the analysis. More profanity during a rebuttal. Drawing the analysis into a thread. Some toss-away scatology at the end. Coming to some sort of a conclusion.<p>I'm not sure I like it, but I really enjoyed reading the format when the author actually was getting to a point. Too many times once the ""fucks"" begin the author goes somewhere out on the deep end and never comes back. This looked like it had been rewritten a bit.<p>Having said that about the format, the content was mediocre. Maybe I've read so much commentary I'm swimming in it, but it just seemed to restate the obvious. Perhaps others got more out it.<p>I'm really interested to see if this style takes off, however. It might have some potential. Not a rant, but not exactly analysis either. Sort of a controlled rant.",1257717183

</code></pre>
You'll find that it does not require ""you and two guys who just got $15k in seed funding"" to purchase company health insurance. Employers with payrolls in excess of $500,000/yr are required to cover their employees. Most responsible companies with payrolls like that already do.<p>In fact, the bill does two things to make it <i>easier</i> for small businesses to handle health insurance:<p>* It provides grants to small business to provide health insurance, based on a dollar formula per qualified employee<p>* It allows companies with fewer than 25 employees to participate in the public health care exchange.<p>These are all just details, though, because the big picture issue here is that this is extremely good news for startups.<p><i>The fact that health insurance is tied to employers is a major challenge for the kinds of companies people on Hacker News try to start. For the first year or so of our company, we didn't offer health benefits, and that cost us candidates. Plenty of A-players need to cover families, and can't do it on the individual market. To understand how severe this problem is, work from the assumption that you simply cannot buy individual insurance at any reasonable rate.</i><p><i>The current system distorts both the health care market and the job market, and makes it harder both to start and grow new companies.</i>",1257716331

It may not be as simple (have to hit the registry, or download an app to do it for you), but it's possible.<p>In regards to the reboot issue, I've never experienced that one (although the continued asking every 15 minutes gets annoying). What probably happened is you were busy typing away and the window came up, just a few keystrokes in that window and you told it to reboot. Definitely a problem - that window, being as destructive as it is, should never be the active window when it pops up.

929805,comment,929524,929524,0,0,jackfoxy,,,"About 17 years ago I took instruction from a teacher of the Bates Method (as refined by some woman whose name I cannot recall). It’s a lot of work. You can expect to put at least an hour a day into it if you want any results. My results were a big improvement, but not an improvement to even close to 20/20 after about a year, so I lapsed and my eyesight eventually deteriorated back to very myopic. I went from -7.25d for 20/20 to -2.00d for 20/40. Not correcting your vision for perfect 20/20 with lenses is one part of the method, and I also tired of never having perfectly corrected vision.<p>""Outdoor seeing"" has a big role in the Bates method with emphasis on horizon focusing and outdoor lighting, as mentioned in this article too, but as well as brighter light, Bates put emphasis on full-spectrum natural lighting. I went so far as to buy full spectrum light bulbs for my house. Unfortunately I could never come up with a good solution for doing computer work in natural lighting. Bates had some downright wrong ideas, so his entire work was never taken seriously by established medicine.<p>During this time I also ran across an Israeli teacher of his own method (pretty much the same as Bates), who liked to say he had a blind certificate from the state of Israel and a driver’s license from the state of California, and he didn’t wear any corrective lenses. However, when his son was born with the same defect he had, he had his son undergo an operation removing the lenses and making his son dependent on contact lenses. He said the natural vision thing was just too hard and he didn’t want his son going through it.",1257714318

929803,comment,929627,929790,0,0,unalone,,,"> Why does Author care enough to close a twitter account, not once, but three times? This seems strange to me.<p>I started one when Twitter started, got rid of it, tried keeping a ""public"" Twitter account for a while, got rid of that too, then had a private one for a bit with friends that I deleted when Facebook changed their feeds. I'll probably start one soon to mirror this new blog, too, hopefully permanently. (I also submit that if I weren't a strange person I wouldn't be writing about Twitter in the first place.)<p>> I use tumblr, and am completely unaware of the ""social features"" which Author speaks of. Threw a hissy fit? Really? Isn't that caring just a little too much?<p>Tumblr used to be my absolute favorite site, back when it was fresh and new and entirely basic. When they added the liking and reblogging I thought it was unnecessary, but acceptable. What pissed me off last year was their Tumblarity system. I can't fucking stand having numbers on web pages; it sets me off. (I dislike karma on HN, too, but this is a social site, whereas I always used Tumblr as a private engine.) It's what led to my ending the last blog I kept. I had a more freeform blog, and I'd started to realize I was posting more fluff content to boost Tumblarity and I was avoiding longform because it was dropping my score. Even now it irritates me that by blog is being ""ranked"" by such an arbitrary metric, and I wish there was an option to disable it and remove myself from the rankings.<p>I think it's a compliment to Tumblr that I got as upset as it was. Most sites are shitty enough that I don't notice when something's bad on it; Tumblr was such a perfect site that the addition seriously worsened it. It's still very good, but it's not what it once was; I was also upset because the Tumblr staff had seemed to share my design philosophy up to that point, and when they added that feature it confirmed the accusations facing them that they cared more about socialite frivolity than they did about the integrity of their design.",1257714145

I've actually had to re-write client-side code (generally just quick hacks, similar to your project) solely for Firefox patching some sort of quirk or behavior change into their browser. It can get especially annoying if you're always testing with the most recent version.<p>Nevertheless its a neat app. ;)",1257714006

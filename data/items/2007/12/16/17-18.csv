90124,comment,90061,90092,0,0,dood,,,"I was suprised to see the photographer and most of the flickr commenters have a similar attitude to copyright as the MPAA and RIAA, often using the same arguements and language, and instinct for legal action.<p>I had kinda assumed that sort of thing was the winding down of huge organizations slowly adapting to the new reality of mashups and whatnot, but there seems to be a lot of anger from small independants about the way the web has changed the business of photography. I'm curious if this is indicative of attitudes of other independent photographers, musicians, artists etc.",1197826099

90122,comment,90096,90096,0,0,ereldon,,,"Anyone else notice that BusinessWeek and the New York Times both just came out with feature articles on how Google is taking on Microsoft via cloud computing? <p>There are even charming anecdotes in both stories from the same engineers -- people like Christophe Bisciglia.<p>Happy Holidays, Google PR.<p>edit: Sorry if I'm coming across as too cynical, but I could have sworn I've been reading very similar Google versus Microsoft articles for years. Of course, that topic is a big deal -- it's just the timing, the lack of a hard-news angle, and the anecdotes in these two articles strongly suggest PR orchestration.",1197825882

Mutation and crossover (with certain conditions) generally mean you don't get stuck in local maxima.<p>Of course, there are conditions on that. The quality of your RNG, the probabilities of mutation/crossover, etc..",1197825213
90117,comment,89987,90001,0,0,rontr,,,"That's true to a degree. However, Google also follows the mantra, ""what's good for the Internet is good for Google."" For example, they provide the monetization system (ads) to ask.com, which is a direct competitor. Why not also provide compute clusters?<p>I think Google and Microsoft are asleep at the wheel while Amazon is forging ahead becoming the leading provider of internet infrastructure for the next generation of startups.",1197825100

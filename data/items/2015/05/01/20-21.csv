With this process, instructors gain little insight into their students’ knowledge. Simply measuring the frequency of a specific mistake requires painstaking tallying. Answering the question “What concepts are my students struggling with?” is practically impossible.<p>Gradescope lets instructors give out the same paper-based assignments, but then grade them online, while keeping track of the exact mistakes made by every student on every question. This enables unprecedented data analytics: for example, we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors get grading done in half the time.<p>Our product has been used to grade over 3 million pages of work belonging to over 30,000 students. We’ve raised a seed round, and are making our first full-time hires to join the founding team of two PhDs and professor from Berkeley CS.

For example, just look at the aftermarket for mechanical improvements for Off road vehicles.<p>Jeeps and Trucks are already among the more heavy-duty vehicles on the road, and for true off-road use, many components need to be replaced.<p>Rather than looking at the existing automotive parts, look at some of the aftermarket fabricators, and parts suppliers that are building out parts designed to replace the standard OEM ones.<p>I agree with the premise somewhat, but more parts and more engines especially is a recipe for reduced efficiency. Take for example the power and capability of a large pickup truck, which gets around 14Mpg, but makes ~400HP and 400ft/lbs of torque. It weighs ~8000lbs, and can tow 10,000. It will handle fairly tough daily use with few failures. When towing 10000lbs, they still get around 9-11mpg.<p>on the other end of the spectrum, a Smart Car might get 38 MPG, but it has 70HP and 68Ft/lbs of torque.

After results claiming thrust from the EM drive were given by paid lab testing and a Chinese study, NASA threw a miniscule amount of effort at this, expecting it to fail. It generated positive results, so they threw in a hair more. This will continue until either very rigorous, well-funded studies duplicate these results, or they are invalidated at a lower- or mid-tier levels of rigor.<p>There should be a reasonable threshold at which we are willing to test ideas that would upset traditional scientific knowledge, or we risk displaying the mental rigidity which we mock in the religious and scientific orthodoxy of ages past. Obviously the perfect candidate idea for such testing would be one in which a sound theory was already present, but there have been examples of profound changes in theory that came about due to strange observations - consider the motion of Mercury and higher-temperature superconductors.<p>I too am excited about the possibility of life in our solar system, and I hope NASA gets probes to Europa, Titan and Enceladus as soon as possible, but these projects don&#x27;t have to compete.

If you are in a job you really don&#x27;t enjoy or are not performing well in, for whatever reason, your top priority is finding a job that better utilizes your talents. A lot of people believe that once you start a job at a certain rate of pay, you can&#x27;t negotiate it up significantly because you will always be anchored to that initial amount. That isn&#x27;t really true. Once you start if you perform well you become a valuable asset, and companies don&#x27;t like to lose valuable assets. One option is to find another company that will offer you the amount you want to make and take it back to your company and ask them to match it. Very often they will and without much argument. However the important thing is to start.<p>Now if you are in a job you enjoy and have no real desire to leave except pay, then you definitely should not disclose your salary, as you have a powerful negotiating position as you really don&#x27;t need to move. However if the company is really pressing you to give them a number and won&#x27;t move you on unless you do, it&#x27;s okay to tell them the number <i>if you are up-front and steadfast</i> in that you are looking for amount $X which could be 1.5x, 2x, or any multiple of what you are presently earning. If they claim they can&#x27;t match it then move on.<p>Finally, never negotiate salary with a recruiter before meeting with the hiring manager. Many times (certainly not always) recruiters do not know much about the job requirements besides what was written by the hiring team in a bulleted list. They don&#x27;t have the authority to grant salary requests, but in many cases hiring managers do. I have had several job offers come in well above what the recruiter told me the job paid. No matter what you are told the salary range is, if a team really wants you, they will pay to get you.",1430512964

A friend hired me a couple of years ago to join his small company as the first developer, during which I disclosed my salary and also mentioned that I was willing to take a pay cut (as I wasn&#x27;t happy where I was, and he was a tiny company still finding his footing).

Simply because the same word is used does not mean the underlying concept is sufficiently similar in both contexts to be relevant.<p>Local momentum conservation is foundational to all of physics: it is embedded in Newton&#x27;s laws, and you can&#x27;t get much more foundational than that. As such, if anything violates it the degree of &quot;extraordinary&quot; would be beyond anything ever seen. Far beyond superluminal nuetrinos.<p>So the previous posters are correct: momentum conservation, which is generally used to mean &quot;local momentum conservation&quot;, is as deeply foundational to physics as Newton&#x27;s laws, and the kind of observable-only-by-statistical-inference non-locality seen in QM is not known to have any impact on it.<p>As such, it would be earth-shaking at the deepest possible levels of physics if this result were correct. That does not mean it is wrong--although that is certainly my bet and that of virtually every other working physcist--but it&#x27;s important not to understate what a big deal it would be, because understanding that opens up alternative ideas regarding how to test it.<p>This is neither arrogance nor dismissal, but an understanding that anything that violates local momentum conservation, via QM or anything else, and <i>also</i> lets the rest of physcis sail blithely on, manifesting no measureable effect of any kind on any of the millions of diverse and precise experiments that have been performed, is astonishingly implausible.<p>Could it happen? Sure. But it&#x27;s really easy for laypeople to radically underestimate the implausibility of such claims, as was done all the time in the cold fusion community.<p>Nor does reproduction of the effect say anything very much about either the underlying theory (such as it is) or the actual cause. Lots of things can create forces of micronewtons, and given how utterly implausible the claim is, most physicists are starting with a prior barely above epsilon. As such, the amount of evidence required to update our belief to something close to unity is going to be huge. Laypeople, who start with an unreasonably large prior because they are ignorant of how fine-tuned such novel physics would have to be to never show up anywhere else, will require less evidence.",1430512522

It allowed children to explore the world on their own, but if anything bad happened they could always rely on parents to be there for them. To tell them things would be fine, or to put a band-aid on their wounds. This allows children to develop trust in others, self-confidence and a positive outlook in life. While at the same time motivating them to explore the world.<p>However, another very important thing was allowing the kids to join in when the family (or other kids) were solving a problem. This could be anything from helping with cooking, fixing something in the house or collecting firewood. I assume the benefit of this was not only practice of problem-solving and social skills, but also allowing them to develop a sense of self-worth.<p>(The problem is, I guess, that our modern world is solving all our problems for us. We don&#x27;t repair, we replace. We buy solutions for things that we&#x27;d had better dealt with ourselves. And so forth.  And that we put so much emphasis on self-reliance, which seems to be a good thing but in reality has serious disadvantages. I believe this is one of the big (root-) problems of our modern civilisation that nobody seems to be talking about, but I might be wrong.)<p>Furthermore, the ability to work on a specific problem _with others_ is a different from being able to do maths alone. It teaches all the right things in life.<p>So I guess the point is: If you want your kid to succeed, be there for and allow it to take part in life the way he or she choses to (all within reasonable limits of course, you still need raise your kids to be decent etc.), especially with others.<p>[1] wish I had a link.. :/",1430512425

I don&#x27;t nor ever could know what it&#x27;s like to be you or any other person, but I can certainly relate and be related to by others as a human.<p>There is over whelming evidence that the brain&#x27;s operation(and thus it&#x27;s resultant product: conscious and human though) <i>is a physical process</i>. There is no physics that suggests we can&#x27;t replicate this process, but using a different substrate(ie electronic computing of some shape or another), and there is no physics that suggests we can&#x27;t make such a system mimic the physical processes as a human.

I often search for ideas on how to help within my area of influence. The closest I&#x27;ve found is Stack Exchange&#x27;s salary matrix, and the related approach at Fog Creek.<p>I think publishing salaries has several benefits. For one thing, it removes the used car salesman approach to hiring. One result, which is more important, is that it can help eliminate wage disparity due to differences of gender or level of negotiating skills. It can also help prevent the corrosive effects that can occur if people do find out actual numbers (the morale-sapping that you discuss).<p>The problem with this approach, and one I&#x27;m trying to figure out is, what about the non-developer jobs? Assumedly, each group gets their own matrix. But if the admins can browse the matrices of the other groups, like the development team&#x27;s, then there can be a similar corrosive effect. One option is to only discuss the salary matrix within your group and with HR. But then we&#x27;re back to a different version of the tired old story. (Don&#x27;t discuss the matrix outside of your group!) This leads me to believe that it&#x27;s best to be completely open.

Here are some of the lessons I have learned in that time:<p>1) <i>Get yourself a decent visualisation of the commit graph.</i><p>You should see at least:<p>* Labels for all local branches<p>* Labels for all remote-tracking branches (&quot;origin/whatever&quot; etc)<p>* A label for the HEAD pointer (i.e. what is currently checked out.)<p>I found the Git Extensions plugin for Windows pretty helpful in this regard, though I think gitk and the Eclipse and Intellij visualisations show them, too.<p>&quot;git log&quot; with default settings does <i>not</i> show anything except your currently checked out branch, which can be extremely confusing.<p>2) <i>When in doubt, do &quot;git fetch&quot;.</i><p>This will synchronize the remote-tracking branches on your machine with the actual state of the remote repository. It will not include the changes into your currently checked out copy and it will not modify the remote repository in any way.<p>Therefore, if you are unsure if your local repository is correctly synced, calling &quot;git fetch&quot; is usually a good (and safe) way to be sure.<p>3) <i>Be careful with &quot;git pull&quot;.</i><p>&quot;git pull&quot; is basically an alias for &quot;git fetch; git merge origin/<the branch you have checked out right now>&quot;.<p>However, what this means is that it will synchronize your &quot;origin/...&quot; branch with the remote repository, then immediately try to merge your local work with whatever changes just got downloaded from your repository.<p>A good analogy for this procedure is &quot;trying to cross a road with your eyes closed&quot;: Because you have no way to inspect the changes that you are actually merging in, this can lead to unexpected conflicts and can be relatively counter-intuitive to undo.<p>If you are not entirely sure about the state of the remote repository, a better workflow is (in my opinion):<p>* Do a manual &quot;git fetch&quot;.<p>* Inspect the &quot;origin/...&quot; branch using &quot;git log&quot; or a GUI and identify any relevant changes and possible conflicts.<p>* Do &quot;git pull&quot; or &quot;git merge origin/...&quot; when you actually want to incorporate the changes into your checked-out copy.<p>4) <i>All the history rewriting stuff creates copies.</i><p>Your old commits are still around, they are just not included in any branch and therefore hidden from most GUIs.

If you have a weak legislature that&#x27;s clean-handed because it does little of consequence, that doesn&#x27;t mean society is magically going to operate better. I&#x27;m also a fan of public-choice theory, but I think there are two aspects of the situation it fails to address:<p>1. Public administration is relatively transparent. Not as much as we&#x27;d like, of course regular people simply don&#x27;t have the time, energy, or expertise to fully exploit this transparency (and so rely on lobbying organizations that do represent their interests, eg the ACLU or EFF), but the public sector is more transparent than the private sector. I don&#x27;t have much faith in market mechanisms to correct excessive behavior in the private sector because bad actors can buy a lot of good PR.<p>2. A non-negligible degree of the power invested in government is the results of demands from the public, eg things like the clean water and the EPA exist because private entities exploited the commons sufficiently that there was eventually an outcry eg repeated fires on the Cuyahoga river. There are many similar demands for governmental action on climate change today, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine a tipping point in the near future with carbon becoming much more heavily regulated than today. The fact that granting more power to government may well result in future abuses doesn&#x27;t negate the existence of problems absent regulation.",1430511172

Truth is, it&#x27;s not very hard for a bad guy to fake his way through a background check.\nInstead, we&#x27;re experimenting with what we call &quot;Mommy Dating.&quot;  A mom (our users are all moms so far, except for me) can browse selfie videos of other moms in her neighborhood.  We believe that &quot;a video is worth ten-thousand words.&quot; If she sees a mom with whom she feels chemistry, she can set up a coffee date at a public place, then perhaps a playdate, before deciding whether to share childcare. \nI have great faith in a parent&#x27;s intuition about other parents, and I see our primary job as making the introductions and letting parents create their own village as they see fit.\nHope this clarifies, David",1430510739

I´ll try to explain this with a simpler example.<p>A long time ago, people thought that the faster than sound planes were impossible, perhaps some wrote that formally. The materials didn&#x27;t have enough strength, it would become too hot, the pressure at some point would be too high, ...  To model a faster than sound plane you need to model a lot of complicated interactions between a lot of atoms, and then you need some simplifications, and with the simplifications used at that time it was impossible.<p>The conservation of momentum is a very low level result, so you don&#x27;t need to put a lot of simplifications to prove it or measure it. For example you can measure the conservation of momentum when a photon hits an electron almost directly: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering</a>",1430510716

These 2-3 years keep blowing past us, but there&#x27;s no 200 mile range $20,000 car yet, if there will ever be.<p>Its a shame that practical and real advances are often &quot;boring&quot; to the typical sci-fi obsessed INTJ males who dominate science on the internet.

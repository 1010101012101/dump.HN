The US has become such an imperialist corporate police state. This coming from a reformed former rah rah america guy. So... Westboro has a point to some of their stuff. As far as protesting soldier funerals, why not? Soldiers spreading american imperialism, murdering children, torturing innocent people. Sure, if God exists and is fair, he hates that stuff and knowing those guys are burning in hell could be a lot of comfort to some.<p>I should state I'm not trolling, but I realize I'll probably get downvoted to hell for this since there is probably no one else in the US that will stand up and say they have something of a point, and also that free speech includes telling bereaved soldier parents their lost child is burning in hell, even though that is a pretty shocking thing to do and it would make more sense to keep that belief to yourself. But they don't. They advertise their politically incorrect beliefs to the world. Takes a lot of balls and a bit of craziness. I certainly wouldn't do it. It took me 10 years to get to the point where I would dare to post this one note which I'll probably chicken out and delete in a bit.<p>But what if everyone said what they really thought about things? Probably there would be utter chaos. I was reading today that a majority of britons believe the police should have used live ammunition to massacre the ""rioters"" (protesters). That opinion I find FAR more psychotic and offensive than what the nuts at Westboro are preaching. I find the advocacy of using live rounds to massacre protesting civilians in the UK to be utterly depraved and insane. That there is a majority that supports this means the world has gone insane and whatever the democratic majority wants or thinks no longer matters because they are as evil and crazy as the lunatics in Germany that elected the Fuhrer and then encouraged him to get rid of undesirables. It wasn't just the Fuhrer's plan all by himself, it was what the evil people wanted. That level of public evil and madness is what I see in Europe and the US today in the general public. A bunch of crazy dangerous people. God hates them? I sure hope so.",1313638687

Use of SMS texting is key here. To your point while some believe frequent weigh-ins are detrimental, there is published literature that supports improved outcomes with frequency of weigh ins, and textWeight 2.0 puts this totally in the hands of the user. As a user, you can configure number of days per week and time of day for text alerts.
I have to agree, overindulgence is generally unappreciated, Self Tapper at 5-7 texts per day may be overboard but that remains to be seen. textWeight also has a weight maintenance option to message and encourage users appropriately. All users receive motivation, support and encouragement based upon their personally defined challenge and latest weight entry. This along with the behavioral information they contribute and our continuous bidirectional dialoguing enables us to provide such encouragement.
This is unique to the healthcare space -- where well designed programs like Text4baby and Vaxtext push messages to survey and collect data to discover their impact.
To your point about filling a low cost niche, we call it providing access in healthcare, we have intentionally used SMS texting to allow for use by feature phones (current smart phone penetration is under 30%) and since being overweight and/or obese strikes across demographics we want to enable broad access to all we can help.

Thus when they get to college they are more mature and ready to learn.
- Many Israeli's in their military service are exposed to ""interesting"" tech research due to Israel's geopolitical situation and resulting posture.
- Israel really has no export other than intellectual property/ideas. So they have invest in education, particularly in the sciences. I visited both the University of Jerusalem and Technion University in Haifa and was very impressed with the directed research I saw.
- There is a deep undercurrent of entrepreneurship due to what my friends there call ""the Jewish mother syndrome"": It used to be Jewish mothers would harp on their kids ""You will be a doctor/lawyer"".  Now it's  ""You will be Bill Gates/Steve Jobs/Mark Zuckerberg"".",1313637493

Is it that you desire a leadership position? There are other ways up the ladder.
Is it that you desire creative challenges?

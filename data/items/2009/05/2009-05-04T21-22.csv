My PhD was a lot of work, and the material itself is of very little value, but the things I learned on the way are absolutely invaluable.<p>I've learned how tell if I'm too tired to work, and techniques for getting me through that.  I've learned how to find the most useful things to work on, and how to leverage them into getting the other stuff done as well.  I've learning how to organise my time, estimate work to do and how to fit it in.  I've learned how to communicate complex technical issues clearly, precisely and for multiple audiences.<p>The PhD was definitely painful, but equally definitely worth it.<p>Other exercises teach you similar things.  Running a small company, saving a dying company, coaching sports for 10 year olds, and so on.  If you use it right, though, school is a great place to learn from your mistakes without it mattering too much.<p>Possibly even more important, learn from other peoples' mistakes.",1241474386

This rings more truthy than true to me.<p>Second, fixing malloc slowness is among the easiest and fastest optimizations you can make in a C program (in most cases, a pool and freelist will get you 90% of the way there), and no GC'd allocator is faster than pool and arena allocation (which is usually just a couple ALU operations in both the alloc and free cases).<p>Third, large C programs tend to start up faster than large HLL programs. For instance, Eclipse is slower to start for me than Firefox --- and if you're thinking of Firefox as your archetypal ""big bloated C++ program"", remember that Firefox is by design the most complicated application most people ever run.<p>To make that argument work, you have to find a HLL program of comparable complexity.

The aliasing issue is the only thing Fortran has going in its favor, but clearly its not ubiquitous. The n-body benchmark, for instance, is fairly typical numerical code. You might even think, since it's simultaneously reading and writing through multiple pointers of the same type, that aliasing is an issue, but its not.

It's not quite as fast as Git, but it's just fine for its purpose.  Most of it is written in Python, with some speed critical parts written in C.  This strikes me as using the right tool for the right job at the right time.  Write most of the app in something like Python.  This makes it easier to write concise, understandable code <i>that reads like pseudocode</i> in a short time.

I wonder how much improvement is left in dynamic compilation.<p><i>The HP project Dynamo was an experimental JIT compiler where the bytecode format and the machine code format were of the same type; the system turned HPA-8000 machine code into HPA-8000 machine code. Counterintuitively, this resulted in speed ups, in some cases of 30% since doing this permitted optimisations at the machine code level. For example inlining code for better cache usage and optimizations of calls to dynamic libraries and many other run-time optimizations which conventional compilers are not able to attempt.</i>

The minimize/maximize/close buttons aren't where I expect them to be, the applications feel strangely constrained, and I hate the menu bar being at the top of the screen.  The Dock icons seem represent a whole bunch of different things (launchers, folders, open documents, running applications) and it's hard to tell the difference based on appearance.  Also, the Dock takes up a lot of screen space, but I don't like hiding it.  I think I'm trained to expect a whole lot of information on the screen, and the Mac aesthetic prefers the opposite, at least in the default configuration.<p>It might help if there were more evident ways of customizing the interface.  I learned how to customize the hell out of my KDE 3 taskbar just by clicking around.  To give OS X a fair shot, I would probably have to buy a book or follow some how-to articles on the web on turning OS X into a more productive environment (like Tog's ""Make Your Mac a Monster Machine."")  That seems to reflect poorly on the interface's explorability.<p>Anyway, according to the prevailing attitude, if I haven't fallen head-over-heels in love with OSX by now, I'm just not a Mac person.

Indeed, his arguments mirrors yours and go even farther.  There's all sorts of magic you can play when you've got access to the actual bits and bytes.  For starters, they do things like stash data in the low-precision bits of floats and the lower three bits of pointers.  I wholeheartedly concur with his opinion that in raw performance terms, C/C++ is the fastest.<p>The problem with his argument and yours is that C is NOT faster for <i>The Rest of Us</i> because it it amounts to premature optimization just by virtue of using it.  And because it takes so much effort to get C code to just work, the WHOLE program ends up being slower than the corresponding code in Haskell, OCaml, or perhaps even CLisp.  Having worked my last job in a company where the programmers preferred C to C++ and C++ to Python, it startles me how utterly slow our system was.

540086,comment,539852,539852,0,0,greendestiny,,,"As complete an analysis of the difference in latency between OnLive and a local game as I can be bothered making is:<p>- player input to server: ping/2<p>- game engine + rendering: same as local<p>- video compression: worst possible is 1/framerate<p>- first video bit back to player: ping/2<p>- whole frame back to player: worst possible 1/framerate<p>- decompression + display: worst possible is 1/framerate<p>So assuming video compression, decompression and transmission are all as slow as they can be thats a total of ping + 3/framerate. So they can rightly claim a perfectly smooth 30 frames a second performance, but the latency could be ping + 100ms worse than a local game. The best case latency approaches the ping.<p>I doubt the compression and decompression is much faster than 60 frames a second, although the transfer time could be quite low in the case of a connection good enough to do HD sending SD. So a more realistic estimate might be ping + 2/60 or ping + 33ms, where a good ping is ~20ms(?) to your ISP or well peered server location. So assuming things work quite well you're looking at >50ms latency. I think that'd be a fairly unsatisfactory experience.",1238507956

Generally, Google acquires companies early on for a price that is favorable to the founders, but wouldn't be favorable to any institutional VC since it wouldn't ""move the needle"" enough.

It isn't technology and business that holds aviation back, it's bureaucracy, law, regulations and existing systems. There are way too many actors that have big stakes in the status quo, on all fronts: existing infrastructure and regulations, money to be made on lawsuits and people's fear of flight, the huge personal freedom that comes with flight (leaving the country becomes pretty trivial if there are small planes everywhere), the tens of thousands of people employed in traditional aviation, ensuring the continued safe operation of the current system etc, etc, etc. The technological problems come <i>on top of</i> this, so no ""investor in his right mind"" would bet the required amount of money to make an attempt.

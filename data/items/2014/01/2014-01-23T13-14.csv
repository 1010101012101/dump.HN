7108088,comment,7107626,7107626,8,0,jnardiello,,,"Well, first of all: i&#x27;m excited to see so many italians over here. We are a quiet but strong community :)<p>As most of the people already said: i feel your pain. There are MANY good advices on here and others have already highlighted most of the options you have. I passed (actually, not yet completely) thru a similar situation. When i was your age, i was completely crushed and just said &quot;fuck you&quot; to everything and left for seeking opportunities and a break abroad. It was a mistake. What really happened was that i was out of control and while i found some opportunities, in the mid-term they were just a waste of time and added very little value to my life in terms of knowledge and new opportunities.<p>1) Leaving Italy and work abroad can be rewarding BUT you need to do it at the right time. First: you need to be REALLY GOOD and competitive in programming. Master your tools and (IMHO) it is very unlikely that you are at the required level right now.<p>2) Mastering tools does NOT mean to learn how to use Angular or learn about the latest framework. Languages, frameworks and libraries are an implementation detail. To master your tools, you need to be a lot better than that (or you&#x27;ll just become a coding monkey). Therefore, stick to your university, focus on patterns and learn <i>real</i> coding best practices.<p>3) Get out of your room. Start to attend to User Groups in your city. Choose something you like (for example, if you are in Milan, i highly recommend you to join us at the PHP User Group or at the Extreme programming user group). You will meet quite-above-average passionate programmers. You will also have the chance to meet inspiring companies that won&#x27;t think twice hiring you if you put the right amount of effort and are passionate about programming. University IS important, but if you feel crushed and unrewarded by it, consider taking it &quot;easier&quot; and start looking for the right working opportunity. This is the thing that changed completely my life.<p>4) Don&#x27;t be afraid to say &quot;F-ck you&quot;. Most of the people out there IS just so mediocre, it is a fact. Avoid them, both on the professional and personal levels. Avoid close-to-slavery jobs proposals. Avoid compromises, understand that every time you waste a minute with any of these mediocre situations, you have a minute less to spend on what you like and with whom you love. They don&#x27;t deserve it. You are a lot better than that.<p>5) It is true that you are not alone. The vibrant and exciting community is just hidden. There are AMAZING programmers in Italy, i&#x27;ll be happy to introduce some to you :)<p>6) Understand that in this moment of your life (if i correctly intended your call for help), you need to recover balance. Balance is the starting point for building great things.<p>Those are just few advices, but they are the core that allowed me to revolutionize for the best my life in the last 6 months. My goal is to give you some very practical and achievable advices. I hope that my feedback somehow helped. If you feel like getting in touch, just write me :) Keep up and be amazing! We live life only once, there&#x27;s no time for this kind of bad feelings.",1390484879

7108060,comment,7107626,7107626,5,0,ninh,,,"Disclaimer: co-founder of a company called Phusion who started the company in his final year of graduating CS... in Enschede, The Netherlands (a city you might have never heard of before, and that I wanted to mention just to underline that it&#x27;s possible to create a company pretty much anywhere thanks to the internet).<p>I think what you&#x27;re struggling with is more of a mentality thing. I used to think I was trapped like you (but then took a macbook to the knee ;-)), but figured out there were a few things I could do about it:<p>- Complain about it (i.e. stating the obvious) which would not solve my situation.<p>- Move to the states to found the company there, which would not solve the situation for future generations.<p>- Try to deal with it somehow, and try to contribute our little share in the hopes of cultivating a local tech industry.<p>We chose the latter, because we&#x27;re the adventurous type I guess and would love to see NL get on the map when it comes to tech startups. Even though this arguably has made things a lot harder for us than they needed to be, we learned a lot by doing it this way. The absence of like-minded people was especially hard for us: startups tend to take a lot of time to set up and can be pretty lonely if you don&#x27;t have people around you that are going through similar stuff as you are. We eventually found a precious few of them in Amsterdam, with whom we regularly have coffee with up till this very day. Now, Italy is a lot larger than the Netherlands so I suspect there are more startups there as well; you just need to find them, perhaps this post will contribute in finding them.<p>Unless you&#x27;re on an applied university, from my experience, programming isn&#x27;t really taught at CS at university level. Instead, the focus is put more teaching you &quot;a way of thinking&quot; and it assumes that you&#x27;ll pick up things like programming in languages like Python/Ruby, and learn about REST on your own time.<p>I believe you might have enrolled into university with the wrong set of expectations: during my entire CS curriculum, I&#x27;ve only had 2 programming courses, but they were focussed more on the paradigms than elaborating syntax; the latter things were assumed trivial and had to be figured out on your own time.<p>It&#x27;s easy to get caught up in things that an &quot;environment&quot; is doing wrong, and to lose sight in what it does right. Personally, I can&#x27;t imagine living somewhere else at this moment in my life than the Netherlands for example, where we have pretty good healthcare, affordable universities, and so forth. If you&#x27;re unable to come up with a list like this, then it might indeed be a good idea to consider moving to another country for a little while and see if the grass is indeed greener on the other side. Shouldn&#x27;t be too hard as an EU citizen right? :)",1390484560

Limit URL entry to only one .php file (like index.php), more rewrite configs and mod_security. So you lost the benefit of copy-to-update, it becomes just as  hard  like other language/frameworks.<p>As ownCloud community grows, I think this problem will surf again and it will end up like many PHP forum/CMS today.

Heck, IBM is actually given as prime example for why big companies fail, with their past failure in the micro-computer market.<p>I mean look how crazy this is. IBM sells the server business because it’s “not profitable for them”:<p>“It’s underperforming because of the cost of doing business on IBM’s side,” he said.<p>But on the other hand, Lenovo wants it because they consider it a profitable business:<p>“Low-cost servers are the fastest-growing, most attractive area of the server business right now, so this would make sense,”<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-18/ibm-said-to-be-in-talks-to-sell-low-end-server-unit-to-lenovo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-18/ibm-said-to-be-in-t...</a><p>This was written to the letter in Innovator’s Dilemma – a decade and a half ago – and yet IBM still failed to see it coming. Some companies just deserve to burn. There’s no excuse.</i><p>Companies getting disrupted need to adjust their cost structures, if not they need to create entirely new business spin-offs that can act as independent businesses. This was discussed in Innovator&#x27;s Solution. It would&#x27;ve given them the ability to actually make money off of this &quot;fast growing sector&quot; like Lenovo calls it. But because of their current cost structures, they can&#x27;t do it now.<p>They are now moving up-market to software and services, and letting Lenovo, a down(er)-market player take this business away from them. What do they think will happen in 5-10 years? Lenovo (or some other PC player/new server player, currently) will move up-market yet again, and do what IBM does cheaper, while still being very profitable, while IBM will be forced to sell that business, too. The solution to disruption isn&#x27;t to run away (at least not in the long-term).<p>This will happen to Intel, too, within 2-3 years. Right now, Intel makes 70 percent of its revenue from ~$200 chips in the PC market. In 2, maybe 3 years at most, that business will be completely commoditized, as ARM chips reach similar performance levels at much low cost.<p>Intel has tried, with little success, to enter the mobile market, but right now they aren&#x27;t making any money, and are in fact <i>losing</i> money with Atom chips, especially since they&#x27;re paying OEMs to buy their chips [1] (anti-competitive? You tell me).<p>Trying to succeed with Atom is sort of the right solution, but if they aren&#x27;t going to make money with their own cost structures, then it&#x27;s going to fail. Trying to succeed with Core chips by lowering power consumption is a losing proposition because those chips are much more expensive.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9245530/How_Intel_is_buying_a_piece_of_the_tablet_market"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9245530/How_Intel_is_...</a>",1390484162

7107927,comment,7107325,7107655,5,0,JackGibbs,,,"You clearly aren&#x27;t familiar with Simmons&#x27; writing style. For instance, in my opinion the best thing he&#x27;s even written was the Oscar Robertson section in The Book of Basketball. He manages, in the course of only a handful of pages, to just about perfectly capture the difficult balance of the O&#x27;s legacy. His enormous talents, his extremely difficult personality, which got in the way of success, and of course the way that the ever-present racism of the era he played in deeply affected both those things. And I&#x27;m not the only one who feels that way. In the second edition, Simmons includes a footnote from Jason Whitlock, one of the most vocal (and, it must be said, controversial) media members about racial issues in sports, and he says essentially the same thing. My point? Simmons uses that language throughout the section. It&#x27;s his style. He&#x27;s informal, he&#x27;s straightforward, he&#x27;s self-deprecating, and he&#x27;s funny, and it&#x27;s why he&#x27;s been so successful and will continue to be. His language in the letter would be troublesome if it was a departure from his usual writing, but it&#x27;s not, and so as an avid reader I don&#x27;t take it as flippant or dismissive.<p>As for your comment about it being 2700 words too long, the original post here is the only professionally published article I&#x27;ve read on the subject since Simmons&#x27; statement (which includes articles on Salon, Washington Post, Deadspin, etc.) which continues to phrase the events as though Hannan acted maliciously. The reason for the length of Simmons&#x27; apology was to make clear that Hannan and the editorial staff were extremely unfamiliar with trans* issues, and that it was that lack of education, and not personal hate or bigotry, that caused Hannan to make the mistakes (which Simmons, it should be noted, takes full responsibility for) he did. He didn&#x27;t realize how grave it is to out someone in the trans* community in life or death, and to him it fit the narrative he found, of an inventor whose life was a complete lie. Again, he didn&#x27;t understand that keeping a gender identity secret is done out of necessity in our culture, and is not in any way a statement of one&#x27;s personal veracity. Grantland also published an op-ed by ESPN&#x27;s Christina Kahrl, who is transgender, in which she eviscerates Hannan and the editorial staff&#x27;s actions (<a href=""http://grantland.com/features/what-grantland-got-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grantland.com/features/what-grantland-got-wrong/</a>). Note that at no point in her attack on Hannan&#x27;s actions does she attribute it to maliciousness. To quote, &quot;revealing her gender identity was ultimately as dangerous as it was thoughtless.&quot;<p>EDIT: I guess I should I add something, just so I don&#x27;t get accused of anything. I attended one of the most progressive high schools in the country, and now attend one of the most progressive colleges, and know many LGBTQ and trans* individuals, with a few of the former counted among my closest friends. I believe that one&#x27;s identity is theirs and theirs alone until they choose (if ever) to come out, and I also strongly believe that active sexual and gender discrimination is a hate-crime. My point is not that Grantland was not horribly horribly wrong. They were. My point is that it was a lack of education that caused their errors, and that the opportunity should be used to continue educating, which Simmons&#x27; piece, even if it seems at times to be attempting to shoehorn in an excuse, does. I know the errors they made, but I&#x27;m sure the vast majority of Grantland&#x27;s readership does not.",1390483062

There&#x27;s a lot of material available on the web for studying on your own and practicing your skills: TopCoder and HackerRank are the first two websites that come to mind. Study hard and practice there, some of the problems you find on those websites are very close to the ones people will ask you during technical interviews. You&#x27;ll need to be quick and accurate in an interview, so be sure to understand why a certain algorithm/data structure works for a given problem. It&#x27;s hard and it requires a lot of time, but since you&#x27;re a student time is on your side (trust me, when you&#x27;ll be working time will be your most valuable resource).<p>Another good thing to do IMHO is to practice programming using open source resources such as GitHub: build a nice repo of projects and you&#x27;ll get noticed. A couple years ago I made a stupidly simple JavaScript program (which I&#x27;ve since deleted) that changed the font size of a text, giving it the shape of a wave, a slope, etc. Very simple, very stupid, but still: I posted it here on HN and I got a couple people watching my GitHub repo. Also, working on personal projects is good for learning programming practices (how to structure code, how to design classes, etc.).<p>As a final note, it may be hard to believe but there are some nice programming jobs here: you just have to look very hard to find them. Don&#x27;t settle for the first job offer you get: I know the market is pretty bad here at this moment but still, unless you really (and I do mean really) need the money, keep looking and most important of all, keep practicing.

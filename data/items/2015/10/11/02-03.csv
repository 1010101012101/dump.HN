I don&#x27;t have to care how Pythagoras&#x27;s theorem may be proven, I know it holds for every right triangle and I can build from there. It&#x27;s a device for encapsulating the proof state space search, saving time when building more complex theories.<p>Re: abstraction, with any name [function] comes a set of properties we know they are true, either explicitly specified or implicitly derived from common sense logic. I don&#x27;t have to care how the sort function is implemented, I only have to know that given an input, it produces an output in a certain relation with the input. From there, I can build more complex programs faster than if I had to write the sort function myself.<p>Once there are functions with a specification, logically speaking one can freely substitute one for another, as long as the specs are in the correct logical implication relation.<p>Excuse me if I&#x27;m a bit baffled of what exactly the intellectual content of OOP is.",1444532368

The argument says &quot;you think X is ok? well, here&#x27;s something <i>horrendous</i> that we all would agree is horrendous that is based on the same <i>justification</i> you used, therefore your justification is no good.&quot; A variation of this says, &quot;Your same logic would support this horrendous example, so what is the distinction in your reasoning that would support your assertion but reject this extreme case?&quot; This form of discourse DOES NOT say that the original claim is to be equated to the horrendous extreme, it only says that the two use the same <i>logic</i> for their support and therefore the logic is invalid.<p>In these types of arguments, person one says badly-supported claim, person two shows the problem with the logic via a reductio ad absurdem example, and you are the <i>only</i> one here who is making hyperbolic claims, namely that a reductio ad absurdem reasonable point is equatable to actually asserting that the original view is the same as the absurd statement, which is a claim nobody was making.<p>In this case, &quot;Internet.org is okay because a limited, restricted network is better than no network&quot; is the original claim, and it&#x27;s <i>implicit</i> support reason is: &quot;even if your freedoms and possibilities are limited, it&#x27;s better than just lacking resources&quot;, and so &quot;is it better to be a slave (and get fed and have shelter etc) than to be poor?&quot; is a <i>reasonable</i> question to clarify the scope of the premise. It&#x27;s not saying they are equitable.

It&#x27;s pervasive and it results in a society homogenous in many aspects.  Of course, there are dissidents and outcasts and otaku and non-conformists, but most observe core attitudes.<p>I think this contributes to the way they can have a degree of dependability on others.

It&#x27;s not that John Carmack isn&#x27;t an amazing programmer (I am sure he is far better than me), but the techniques for readability and maintainability that he used in those games are just what anyone writing in a large codebase should be doing. The style he used is exactly what we demand when interviewing senior devs. But then game programmers look at it as if he had discovered cold fusion. But when all you see is games, that are written expecting that once the game is shipped, nobody is going to touch your code again, standards go down. Very different from what we do in business programming, where we know some systems might end up living 15+ years, so we have to write things planning for the system to keep evolving for decades.<p>If anything, online games and MMOs should be written better, precisely because they are far long lived, and will be edited more, than a throwaway that will just see a few patches if users complain.",1444530948

It seems to be much less controversial than other breaking changes in Python 3.<p>I think the more important reason is that Python doesn&#x27;t really have an emphasis on the boolean type in general. The `if` statement works for every type, in contrast to other languages allowing only the boolean type in `if`. It is very common to use `if string_or_number_or_anything: blah blah` in Python. While I won&#x27;t make a stance whether this is a good thing or not, it is still awkward that Python allows implicit conversion between `bool` and `int`.",1444529457

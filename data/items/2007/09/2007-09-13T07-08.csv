(fuel tank capacity - gallons needed to fill tank when gas light turns on) * (average miles per gallon)<p>I have about 4 gallons left when the light turns on. 2 gallons left when the needle dips below the ""empty"" line. The emptiest my tank has ever been is 0.5 gallons left.",1189669502
54158,comment,54000,54000,0,0,Tichy,,,"I didn't have time to read to the end. However, one question: isn't it kind of dangerous to store the data as code? Suppose the log file would be written as a LISP program, wouldn't it open the door for all sorts of nasty code injection hacks? Sure, you can make sure to always escape the text properly, but I prefer the defensive kind of security (only open up the ports you really need) rather than trying to anticipate all possible hacks.<p>Also, there is something like XPath for Java classes, I think it is called JXPath, but I am not sure. I guess one could also use the query language from Groovy as an alternative.",1189669169

Mostly looking to get some feedback from the bright folks who hang out on this forum. Also if anyone's interested in taking part, or just wants to talk about it.. drop me a line at seiji.t at gmail",1189668725

I can write an entire article refuting every point he attempted to make.. there are so many Western ""innovators""
in the artistic field who were ""inspired"" by Eastern ""copycats.""  Then again, their innovative works were partly
influenced by previous artists who were, interestingly enough, Western.  Point being, there's no difference in the willingness of one to be innovative, East or West.  There are standardized social constraints in any culture but to those with the will to innovate they are irrelevant in making their decision to execute.. results and consequences are a different story. Sorry if this sounded like a rant.. I was just upset by the reality that people with this kind of uneducated views are still abundant. New York City with slanty eyes?? come on

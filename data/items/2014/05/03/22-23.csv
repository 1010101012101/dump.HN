I&#x27;m just explaining why <i>I</i> find it frustrating that so many people now assume others will work <i>their</i> way, as if using GitHub is some sort of universal norm.<p><i>Hosting your own source repository also has unknown security, privacy and reliability implications.</i><p>So the cloud guys keep saying. And yet we keep hearing about downtime and security breaches in cloud services, while the servers and normal Git repos I use regularly all seem to work just fine. I guess the guys running all those projects must be some kind of sysadmin demigods or something.<p><i>It doesn&#x27;t really matter to Github users if you don&#x27;t want to use Github.</i><p>It does if they want me (or anyone with similar feelings; let&#x27;s not make this personal) to contribute to their projects.<p><i>Doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense that you would decline to make bug reports just because the project used Github.</i><p>I don&#x27;t. I decline to make bug reports when <i>making the bug report</i> requires the use of GitHub, which is probably a more dangerous trend that I have observed with increasing frequency in recent months.<p><i>That sounds like you are boycotting those projects for some moral reason.</i><p>I have no idea where you got that from. I&#x27;m not &quot;boycotting&quot; those projects at all. But since I can&#x27;t create a free GitHub account just to contribute to them without affecting anything else I might do there, and since participating via GitHub is significantly more hassle than contributing to other projects I have supported in various ways, I choose to spend my available time where I can help other projects more efficiently.",1399157941

7692638,comment,7692167,7692167,1,0,transfire,,,"For decades I have heard that 11nm would be the end of Moore&#x27;s law as we know it. This is proving to be true. CPUs have been frozen at 1 to 4GHz for nearly a decade, with the latest advances going to power savings. Currently at 22nm, the next step is 14, and then 11. Perhaps they can eek out one more jump to 7nm or 5nm, but I expect that will barely be worth the effort and thus will drag out for at least decade itself.<p>But Moore fans need not worry. There is a clear next step, and I am wondering why no one is talking about it: Optical Interconnects. Connecting chips and circuits within chips with optical channels should allow plenty of room for speeding up processors and reducing power requirements well into the mid-21st century.",1399157840

7692576,comment,7692320,7692320,2,0,User9821,,,"1. Who is making the offers? Your average hairdresser is an employee, they have no interest in spending their day managing offers online, and it doesn&#x27;t offer them the experience they&#x27;re looking to gain. This means the salon will need to hire another person that can make offers to individuals online, or the owner themselves will need to take on this extra work. This can&#x27;t be anyone, they need to be familiar with different hairstyles, their difficulty, and rates.<p>2. How much time does it take to acquire a customer by making offers? What happens if the customer asks questions online? How much is a price for X? Oh, that&#x27;s too much, what about if I do Y? Would you be willing to lower your offer from $25 to $20? Then, they disappear. I have a feeling they&#x27;d waste a lot of time making offers, while seeing little return. The cost is simply too little for the time spent communication with individuals.<p>3. How does this compare to hiring someone to stand in front of the store waving a sign? As someone else said, haircuts are impulse purchases for a lot of people, so if you have someone standing on the street, telling people walking by that haircuts are 10% off today only, would they bring in more customers then someone online making competing offers? With the sign, at least the person is already standing next to your salon, so they&#x27;ll convert to customers better than someone online.<p>4. Who is this for? Most people have a regular hairdresser that they have a relationship with, so I&#x27;d think they&#x27;re unlikely to change. When I relocate to a new city, I just check Google maps for barbershops or salons, and the majority have reviews. I pick one closest, with positive reviews, that focuses on men&#x27;s hair. That&#x27;s it.<p>The idea of businesses making offers to customers isn&#x27;t a bad one, but I think you need to rethink the niche, hairstyling isn&#x27;t a business where I could see this working.<p>Edit: I had to step out for a bit. To expand though, what if you applied this to a different industry, like cars? I could say I&#x27;m looking for a 4 door car, max budget X dollars, and local dealers could submit cars they have available with their best offers. Car dealers are pretty competitive, so I think they would be more willing to put forth effort to chase customers than a hairstylist. Also, if you make a sale, you could earn a thousand in commission, instead of $2. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;ll work, that was just a general suggestion for why you might want to look towards other markets.",1399156432

It goes like so: consumer buys expensive product, product lasts 10 years then breaks, consumer can&#x27;t buy same product again so they buy similar product from same manufacturer but product is now cheaper. Product lasts 5 years. Consumer is upset that product didn&#x27;t last and wonders why they spent so much money. Consumer buys 3rd product from same or different manufacturer but buys cheaper or cheapest model due to not wanting to waste money. Product lasts 2 years. Consumer vows to only buy cheapest product from now on. Manufacturer continually offers cheaper products that last less and less.<p>Manufacturers will have a hard time convincing consumers that their products will last because of what the last decade had shown us so the only solution is not to offer a product so cheap that people will take a chance on it because then people will think the quality goes in hand with the price. Nay, the solution is to warranty the product much longer and earn the trust of the consumer.<p>Manufacturers likely won&#x27;t do this because a 20% profit margin on an expensive product lasting 10 years isn&#x27;t nearly as appealing as 3 3.333-year lifespan products at 40% margins each.<p>Manufacturers don&#x27;t need their product to last long, just longer than their competition&#x27;s products.",1399154987

For example:<p><pre><code>    % openssl ciphers -v\n    ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 TLSv1.2 Kx=ECDH     Au=RSA  Enc=AESGCM(256) Mac=AEAD\n    ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 TLSv1.2 Kx=ECDH     Au=ECDSA Enc=AESGCM(256) Mac=AEAD\n    ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384 TLSv1.2 Kx=ECDH     Au=RSA  Enc=AES(256)  Mac=SHA384\n    ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384 TLSv1.2 Kx=ECDH     Au=ECDSA Enc=AES(256)  Mac=SHA384\n    [...]\n</code></pre>\nAn SSL/TLS cipher suite is a specific combination of a key exchange method (the method the TLS peers use to exchange the keys used with the bulk cipher), an authentication method (the method the TLS peers use to authenticate each other), a bulk encryption cipher (the symmetric cipher used to encrypt data sent between the peers), and a message authentication code (the method used to verify that data isn&#x27;t modified in transit).  These four things are the &quot;Kx=&quot;, &quot;Au=&quot;, &quot;Enc=&quot;, and &quot;Mac=&quot; columns in the output above.<p>Virtually all X.509 certificates issued by certificate authorities today for use with SSL/TLS are for use with cipher suites that use RSA authentication.  You generate an RSA key pair, stuff your public key in a certificate signing request, staple some money to the CSR, and hand it to the CA.  The CA takes your money, verifies that you are in control of the hostname(s) you want a certificate for, creates a certificate containing your public key (and other X.509 goop), signs the certificate with their private key, and hands the certificate to you.  For better or worse, this isn&#x27;t changing.<p>What is being proposed is the removal of cipher suites that use RSA for key exchange (&quot;openssl ciphers -v kRSA&quot;) from TLS 1.3.  There are many other cipher suites that use RSA for authentication but use other methods for key exchange (&quot;openssl ciphers -v aRSA:\\!kRSA&quot;), and some of these other key exchange methods have the rather nice property of perfect forward secrecy.<p>(Note that OpenSSL&#x27;s list of ciphers isn&#x27;t exhaustive, especially if you&#x27;re using the lame OpenSSL build that Apple ships.  But even if you&#x27;re using an up-to-date OpenSSL build, the various SSL and TLS RFCs specify so many cipher suites that even OpenSSL doesn&#x27;t support them all.)",1399154681

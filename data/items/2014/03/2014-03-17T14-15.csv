Also, how much is your health worth?<p>I had severe RSI problems several years ago, but managed to get it under control, and I am now completely recovered.

Working from the top down is the right course when you need to preserve funds (high margins) and can&#x27;t yet scale (general production, battery, limited demand at the time). My point was simply that it&#x27;s a flawed argument to say you can maintain high margins, while still servicing the mass market with the absolute best design, materials, manufacturing.<p>If a car manufacturer could, it would be disruptive - but it&#x27;s the exception, not the rule. That said, I think Tesla&#x27;s the most likely candidate to do this! But it&#x27;s worth noting they did it from the top moving downstream. It&#x27;s more difficult to do this when you&#x27;re starting at the position of a Kia or even a Toyota.

(This is the strategy recommended at <a href=""http://laputan.org/mud/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laputan.org/mud/</a>).<p>Go is pretty perfect for your use-case, though; it produces portable, low-ish level application code, and while it&#x27;s a bit less performant than C, you don&#x27;t really need every scrap of C&#x27;s performance in the way an OS or a 3D game does. Besides all that, it&#x27;s very easy for grumpy, staid old C developers to learn, in the same way that Plan9 is easy for grumpy, staid old Unix administrators to learn: it&#x27;s all the same ideas, just streamlined for newer use-cases.",1395067835

I know it might seem like a luxury, an excess, or something you _want_ but do not _need_, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the case. I think it&#x27;s easy and more impactful to get a cheap tablet in the hands of someone in need to help them learn, than a big computer. Particularly in urban communities, there might be something pretty profound about getting more tablets in front of young kids. It&#x27;s up to them what they search for and what they learn, and it&#x27;s up to us to nudge them in the right direction in terms of pre-loaded apps and websites - but I do believe there&#x27;s something there.

I would just say you don&#x27;t have to go to a third world country to find someone who wants to save $200 on a tablet.

Even if you have a problem with Microsoft, I think it is wrong to let your &quot;MS-hate&quot; translate into &quot;C#-hate&quot;. It is a beautiful language and the open-source community around it is growing rapidly. The progress made by platform-independent endeavors (case in point Xamarin) is admirable.<p>In the unlikely scenario that all of programming were to converge into one language, I would want it to be an open-source, platform-independent version of C# (with maybe just a tad more constructs borrowed from the functional programming world).<p>P.S.

Instead I tried to be that person who always makes you feel like you can do anything, who always praises and never criticizes, who believes in you and your ideas, because that&#x27;s the kind of person I look up to.<p>True, I had to ignore some technical deficiencies a few times, but life&#x27;s too short. Plus, who am I to think I have all the answers? Maybe those technical deficiencies are really innovations in disguise, which I just lack the proper imagination to see properly at this early of a stage? Even more reason to overlook it and be supportive rather than critical.<p>So far it&#x27;s working out well. My professional relationships are improving, and I feel like much less of a sour-puss than before.

Say what you want about C++, but I think they have the right approach. If you are the steward of such a fundamental project, it is definitely in your users&#x27; (and therefore your project&#x27;s) best interest to keep everything that exists working. It&#x27;s just not worth the pain to make trivial changes in the name of aesthetics or &quot;usability&quot; that break every single hello world program (making print a function instead of a statement) or to change how the division operator works for your millions of existing users to save some initial confusion for hypothetical potential users.<p>C++ may have become a bit unwieldy as a result of the combination of this policy and the focus on adding new features, but developers working on existing code bases can continue to develop happily ignoring as much of C++11 as they like without the concern that the plug will be pulled in their platform some time soon. As they decide to adopt the new features, they can, based in the merits of the feature, not because they are forced to by the platform&#x27;s developers.<p>There are starting to be some compelling features in py3k, but none of those required the massive language breakage that has happened between Python 2.x and these releases. All of the compelling features could have been added piecemeal through the normal backward-compatible deprecation and release process.

It&#x27;s industry sponsored double-speak. Judging by your response, it appears to be working.<p>His initial statements that GMOs don&#x27;t exacerbate the problem and that resistance is completely independent of GMOs are false. Full-stop. When challenged, he goes on to admit as much by acknowledging the well-known fact that resistance has increased where the Roundup Ready case is concerned.<p>But, he then tries to qualify and obfuscate that acknowledgment by saying that <i>overall</i> resistance is decreased by a corresponding amount for other herbicides which are subsequently used less.<p>The problem with this is that it is misleading and seeks to let GMOs off the hook. It even applauds them. The reality is that humans are now using and consuming more glyphosate. He tries to dismiss this effect by cheerleading their safety (which is anything but assured when independent research is considered).<p>The other pernicious bit of his argument is due to the fact that, in the future, we are likely to use more and more herbicide-resistant GMOs.

On one team I had to make a dictum that barred LINQ from even being used, except in exceptional circumstances.<p>I do not mean to raise the ire of defensive .NET programmers by saying this: as with most things, used right it is a beautiful thing, and there is nothing <i>fundamentally</i> wrong with LINQ. But what it was used for in practice was almost always grotesquely inefficient.<p>If someone had to make a loop to iterate objects to find a member on every function call, pretty soon they&#x27;ll realize they should using a System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary for instance, or some other appropriate data structure (e.g. Need sorted data? Then use a sorted tree, for instance). When it&#x27;s a simple LINQ query, though, it&#x27;s one seemingly harmless little line, so it tends to get a pass.<p>Pretty soon profiles were just hundreds (if not thousands) of different cases where LINQ was used as a cure-all, destroying performance under any load at all.<p>LINQ is not magical. It is doing the same dirty work that you would be doing yourself if you needed to filter / sort / recast, but provides syntactical sugar to do so. The compiler and runtime will happily generate horrifically inefficient code if you request it, with no warning or complaints.<p>The tldr; is that it is a fantastic set abstraction that is more often than not grossly abused.",1395065899

Only now you&#x27;re saved the callback spaghetti.<p>Node.js advocates are literally peddling callback spaghetti as an advantage because &quot;it lets you write much faster applications with ease&quot;, yet Haskell&#x27;s threads and blocking semantics blow any Node.js out of the water by an order of magnitude.

HR seems powerless and there seems to be a very immature culture, inapproriate non-employee influence, and communication at Github and given that it is mostly young-males, may have a (perhaps inadvertent) gender bias that they do not see  motivated to fix. This is a big problem and  I think there can be a balance between not being stuck up and removing the &quot;fun,&quot; while also being decent, well-meaning human beings. I admit it&#x27;s a very hard balance that I think everyone is still trying to figure out in this rebellious stage of the stodgy era.<p>2. While I believe Julie&#x27;s basic observations are valid, I agree based solely on her account so far that she was being treated differently and that there were inappropriate behaviors going on, especially with the wife – I do get the sense that Julie was considering a lot of normal societal behavior with gender-specific contexts.  &quot;Oogling&quot; people isn&#x27;t good, but it&#x27;s a fine line. People are going to find each other attractive. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong, either. As mentioned here, finding someone attractive doesn&#x27;t mean you discard everything else about them as a person. These things can work both ways, she just may see it from a different perspective because she&#x27;s outnumbered. But this supposedly was at a party and so I&#x27;d expect looser rules there as it&#x27;s not in a professional setting. There&#x27;s a difference between inappropriate and just being human.<p>All of this is a fine line and is why being human is hard and trying to manage people and create a positive, but also fun work environment is hard and we still have a lot to learn during these experimental phases. The issue really needs to be helping eliminate different treatment based on gender and sexuality rather than creating a specific type of culture. I do not necessarily believe we need to eliminate all sexuality or all fun or all emotions from a particular work environment. There can be different places and different people with different preferences can gravitate between them. I don&#x27;t think going back to all stodgy, emotionless, and overtly-bureaucratic environments is a good thing.<p>Like everything in life it seems, there really is a balance.",1395065225

There are objects that are intended to fulfill specific requirements and budgets. Apple has the luxury of selling high-end products to people, like me, who are lucky enough to afford (unsubsidized) $600 phones. We take it for granted, but that&#x27;s not the norm for a bunch of great people.<p>There&#x27;s an office chair at Staples that is uglier than the chair I sit in.

He said the actual cost to the manufacturer of a car in terms of product design is negligible. You could design the most beautiful car in the world without dramatically changing the sticker price for the finished product. So maybe Kia should go for it: spend millions of dollars per year and put together the best design shop the industry has ever known! Design an incredible new studio for them to work in. Give them the best tools. A completely new prototyping facility to print their designs. Hire color consultants to get the paint <i>just</i> right.<p>And then tell them they can only use the materials and manufacturing process of today&#x27;s $12,000 car, and somehow ensure the incredible demand for the most beautiful car ever conceived did not impact the price in any way.<p>Is it any wonder Tesla, despite Musk&#x27;s claims, is working his way from the top of the market, and not the bottom?<p>Tim Cook said last year something similar with regard to Android tablets. He said those tablets are collecting dust (my cheap, $199 Nexus 7 is not). If a parent really cared about their children&#x27;s education, they would opt for a more expensive iPad because it has better children&#x27;s apps (probably true right now).<p>This is the same line of communication that Ive demonstrates here. To me, it&#x27;s dismissive. I actually love my little daughter a whole bunch. I&#x27;m crazy about her. I don&#x27;t measure that love in dollars, and I actually think a cheaper, more durable Nexus 7 is the better option for her to play with right now.<p>Apple&#x27;s communications are borderline dismissive to people who are less fortunate and less lucky. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s intentional, because they are full of wonderful people, but I wish they would be more careful in their communication.

The military has known this for a long time. There are 2% of people who don&#x27;t have the stress-sensitivity of the other 98%. They can be placed in danger or have to kill others and they won&#x27;t get PTSD, and they don&#x27;t get the context-driven anxiety and depression disorders that most people get from overwork. They&#x27;re neurologically insensitive. Not all of them are bad people (some are very good people, if neurologically indistinguishable from murderers, because morality won&#x27;t show up on an MRI) but half of them are psychopaths. You want people from that 2% (at least, the good ones who have a sense of morality and conscience; but the bad ones are often directed toward things like running POW camps) doing elite and dangerous work (they often enjoy it) but not making general-level decisions that affect thousands.",1395065011

This takes magnitudes more time than just a function call. There are some parameters you can tweak in it, but I think that is the reason many games have their custom allocator, which malloc a huge chunk of memory and then keep it until the program exists.",1395064993

Last post, because there are some points I have to answer.<p><i>> That is, you&#x27;re using &quot;facts&quot; to mislead in very much the same way that Monsanto does. What&#x27;s your affiliation with them or related companies?</i><p>I have no affiliation with Monsanto or any related company. I&#x27;ve never, to my knowledge, met or corresponded with anyone who works for them. I&#x27;ve very deliberately avoided doing so because I want to remain impartial in my role as a plant scientist. My research is funded by the Millennium Seed Bank, a conservation organisation.<p><i>>...you are flailing about between arguments...you are arguing both sides...</i><p>I&#x27;m just presenting the facts, there are no sides, there is just the simple fact that the total rate of herbicide resistance has decreased. If you&#x27;re incapable of seeing that it is possible for all the things I&#x27;ve said to be true then I don&#x27;t know what to suggest.<p><i>>what happens when we have herbicide-resistant GMOs for every herbicide in significant use?</i><p>Then we need to use less herbicide to achieve the same effect, because we can apply it directly to the crop after planting, killing the emerged weeds. With other herbicides, they have to be applied pre-emergence, sterilising the soil, which requires larger doses. Secondarily, there&#x27;s no way we will have GMOs resistant to every herbicide that are <i>currently</i> in significant use because many of the older, more harmful ones will soon be illegal.<p><i>>You keep calling it safe but, as is often the case with chemicals meant to kill, the independent research is calling these safety claims into serious question.</i><p>I&#x27;m calling it safe <i>relative to other herbicides</i>. To feed everyone, herbicides have to be used. These chemicals are meant to kill <i>plants</i>, although some of the older ones has non-specific modes of action that might also harm animals. Glyphosate in particular targets a protein, ESPS synthase, that only exists in plants and microorganisms.  It&#x27;s been extensively tested and, you are wrong, there is not research calling the safety claims into question - the safety rating of glyphosate accurately reflects the state of knowledge. If you&#x27;re seriously interested, just read the literature. Everything you&#x27;re saying just demonstrates that you&#x27;re not taking your information from the literature. A good start is the GENERA database of independently-funded studies on GMOs[0].<p><i>>The result is that we just don&#x27;t know when we&#x27;ve reached a tipping point until it&#x27;s too late.</i><p>This is true for absolutely anything. Wearing clothes, watching TV, fluorescent lighting, using a toilet, eating organic food, eating GMOs, and so on. We have to use short-term studies to infer safety.<p><i>>It boggles my mind when scientists, of all people, show little regard for the complexity of the human organism and make such cavalier statements about the safety of consuming chemicals that are intended to kill.</i><p>Nothing is more important to me than human wellbeing. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve dedicated my life to, for very low pay, and I work incredibly hard to a) develop the technology to allow us to alleviate hunger and b) maintain a thorough understanding of the working of the agricultural system and its implications.

If you need low-level control or you need to squeeze out every possible clock cycle, use C/C++; they&#x27;re designed for that sort of thing and they have the tool chains, the APIs, the pool of available expertise. If you don&#x27;t need those things, use a managed language; my preference is Python, but if Haskell is what floats your boat then by all means go with that.",1395064899

It would be hard to do it in a western nation, but if you were aiming at a city near the &quot;frontier&quot; of India, Pakistan, etc. a bad actor could likely execute the plan before the jets they scramble could intercept the jet. There&#x27;s a lot of bad stuff you could do with a flying metal tube capable of carrying 200,000 lbs of whatever you can get your hands on.<p>I don&#x27;t think it was a state actor though. If it was a state actor, who would it have been? My bets are on Pakistan if it was a state actor; they&#x27;re one of the only ones with a sophisticated enough intelligence organization to be able to hide a plane like this. In many cases, it&#x27;s hard to tell where the ISI ends and the Taliban begins. Though the same could be said for Iran and Hezbollah, though the Iranian government has taken a reconciliatory tone with the west as of late and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d risk it. It likely wasn&#x27;t North Korea; the social engineering required would be too high and the North Koreans are largely incompetent at covert operations outside their borders due to their xenophobia. I don&#x27;t think many other states with the capability to do something like this would risk it; the amount of publicity on this is too high.<p>If the plane was hijacked and successfully landed somewhere (and that&#x27;s a big if -- IMO it&#x27;s just as likely that it&#x27;s at the bottom of the ocean and will never be found) it was probably a coordinated effort between a terrorist group and rogue elements within the Pakistani ISI. I don&#x27;t think the older pilot was involved; there&#x27;s been a lot made of his links to a controversial opposition leader in Malaysia, but his ideology doesn&#x27;t align with any of the terror groups (Anwar Ibrahim is considered a liberal reformer) and all of the &quot;controversy&quot; around him is corruption-related -- not the type of thing that would cause someone to shift toward radical Islam.",1395064874

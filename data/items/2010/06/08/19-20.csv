They all, for the most part, seemed to appeal directly to very large businesses in which collaborating and talking to each other was not that easy or aimed specifically at (traveling) salesman who need to maintain a gazillion different contacts/relationships.<p>It got me thinking about a CRM created largely with the freelancer in mind.  Users create a form of sorts to embed on their site, potential clients then fill it out and it's funneled and organized in the app.  I think this could be a really great tool, especially for people who get a lot of requests.<p>I'm mainly wondering if:<p>1)  Do you think this is a good idea or does email suffice in managing new and potential clients?<p>2)  Can you think of any other features to go along with this idea that would also benefit freelancers (besides the obvious ones like invoicing and time tracking as those two spaces are very crowded)?<p>3)  Would you pay for a tool like this?<p>And also, on that note, what about a workroom of sorts (similar to Elance) where you can pass back and forth all communications?",1276027014

My position is it is lexically recognized, but not by enough people.<p>It seems to me that a lot of people do draw a line between pixels and dots, and that a lot of people don't (but usually mean pixels). I don't know if there are proper authorities for this, but I consider the distinction important enough to warrant specific language. My dictionary here says that pixels are onscreen dots - I used to think the same, but now I consider pixels to be the samples in memory. I think you are with the dictionary, since you used the term ""physical pixel"". My adopted distinction meshes well with my ability to change the resolution of my desktop, measured in pixels, but not the resolution of my display, measured in dots.<p>I agree that Bray can call it a 300dpi display - I didn't criticize him for it - and I explicitly translate that to a 300ppi natural resolution display. As noted above (according to Wikipedia), some manufacturers are now exploiting this by reporting such displays as 900 dpi, counting the subpixels as dots. Therefore I consider it important to state natural resolution ppi numbers for devices with natural resolutions, such as LCDs, and dpi resolutions for devices that don't have a natural representation of a pixel, such as CRTs. Representation numbers, ppi and dpp, I have yet to see anyone provide (maybe because there are too many resolutions already).<p>tl;dr: It's confusing people, so make the distinction if you can.",1276025199

Until they do, ""abandon your ego"" is a rather trivial bit of advice -- far easier said than done.<p>Most importantly, however, it's not clear that it's actually <i>good</i> advice:  most people are more effective in life with a bit of recognition, and geeks, in particular, are famously limited by their lack of talent for self-promotion.  Is it any surprise that they'd <i>like</i> the inference that self-promotion is an evil to be avoided? (Personally, I like to be told that women love, pale, gangly guys who are good with computers.

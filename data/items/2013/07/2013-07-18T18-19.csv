  but Racket has the edge in places where the bulky, slow-to-start JVM
  runtime isn&#x27;t welcome. (Racket executables can be as small as 700kb.) 
  Racket has by far the strongest story for beginners due to its friendly 
  culture and emphasis on documentation.
</code></pre>
This has sort of been my conclusion after a survey of Chicken, CL, Clojure, and Racket in which I have burned many hours and have thought many times, &quot;Aha! This is the lisp to learn!&quot;<p>Given that Racket is branded somewhat as a language toolkit, I&#x27;d love to see some of the Clojure stuff I love (pervasive immutable data types, map destructuring) added into a Racket. There&#x27;s Clojure/JVM, Clojure/JavaScript, and even Clojure/Python. Why not Clojure/Racket? Such a language should even support tail recursion.",1374173973

Netflix &quot;cheaped out&quot;, wants it for &quot;maximum compatibility&quot; (what?), is doing it to be &quot;simpler&quot;, or hand-wringing about whether or not it&#x27;s technically feasible to automatically zoom in on the faces in that way.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to explain why they are doing this: <i>the studio is giving them this version of the movie and Netflix is uploading it</i>.<p>There are plenty of 2.40:1 movies on the service, mostly newer ones. House of Cards is a nonstandard 2:1 aspect ratio. If they cared about cropping the movies they&#x27;d do it to all of them. They don&#x27;t.<p>The studios just already have these HD transfers of movies that were probably made years ago for television broadcast and that&#x27;s what they give to Netflix. Case closed.<p>That said, every movie should be available only in its original aspect ratio, and anything else is bogus. Film aesthetics rely on someone not cropping the shot. For example, in <i>Super 8</i> the movie begins with a shot of a metal sign at a factory. That sign is 2:40:1, just like the movie&#x27;s aspect ratio. It&#x27;s almost certain that JJ Abrams had them build that sign at that aspect ratio on purpose so it would fill the frame. The version on Netflix, it&#x27;s cropped off and you can&#x27;t read part of it. Bad.",1374173299

In Snowdens information strategy, he distributed sets of the information in such a fashion that if he is taken, then other people will move to release information.

6065481,comment,6033567,6036587,2,0,omegaham,,,"Women in the military is a really, really complicated topic. It&#x27;ll take a long post to do it justice; you could easily write several books on the subject.<p>First, as you have said, the military has always been a male-dominated institution. The first time that we actually started putting large amounts of women into uniform was during World War 2. We took women for clerical jobs so that more men were able to fight on the front lines. The recruiting slogan was &quot;Free an Man to Fight.&quot;<p>The military has always been seen as a catalyst for social change. It&#x27;s arguable that the integration of black and white soldiers was the first step in the civil rights movement, and the end of Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell is probably going to be seen as the first step of the federal government ending <i>de jure</i> discrimination of gay people. With this in mind, a lot of feminist lobby groups are trying to do the same thing with women with the exact same goals.<p>The problem is that men and women are much further apart than these other integration challenges. Black men and white men are culturally different, and there were a lot of problems with integration. I&#x27;d say that there still are problems; if you look at a battalion, you&#x27;ll notice that all the black guys hang out with each other, all the Hispanic guys hang out with each other, and so on. However, everyone is still able to function as a unit. The same is true for gays. I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s mostly because most gay men stay in the closet for their terms, (lesbians are almost universally accepted) but the repeal of DADT didn&#x27;t really have much of an effect on anything because a gay man is still basically the same as a straight man when it comes to doing work.<p>This is not so with women.<p>Similar to firefighting work, the military is a very physical job. Everything ends up being physical in some shape or form, and it really doesn&#x27;t matter which MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) you pick, you&#x27;re going to end up doing something physical as a matter of your daily duty. There are particularly egregious cases where they stick women into Ordnance, but even a job like avionics technician involves doing hard labor (Ha, you thought you&#x27;d use a soldering iron all day? Guess your recruiter didn&#x27;t tell you that you have to take off all the hydraulic lines before you can take the control box out. Have fun).<p>There&#x27;s a very clear double standard that is communicated, and it&#x27;s insidious for several reasons. When a man &quot;falls out&quot; (can&#x27;t keep up with the rest of the unit) of a run, his life sucks. In my shop, falling out means you just volunteered to run with the master sergeant at 2:00 in the afternoon. It&#x27;s summer in Arizona, and it&#x27;s usually around 115 degrees. Not a good time. We have a guy who isn&#x27;t very good at running; as a result, he gets to run every day at 2:00. He is pretty miserable. He&#x27;s definitely getting better, though.<p>When we had a female sergeant, she also fell out every time. The response was indifference because, &quot;well, she&#x27;s a woman and it&#x27;s just par for the course that women can&#x27;t keep up with men.&quot; It&#x27;s also implicit that said sergeant could make the case that the master sergeant is only making her run at 2:00 because she&#x27;s a woman. The case would go, &quot;Your standard is too high, and you know that I can&#x27;t keep up. You&#x27;re being a big meaniehead and you&#x27;re only making this standard because you&#x27;re sexist.&quot; The master sergeant&#x27;s career would be fried before you can say &quot;Equal Opportunity.&quot; An EO case is a career-ender.<p>Because this issue can&#x27;t be dealt with in the open, (it&#x27;s verboten to say that women are simply not as physically capable as men) you have a lot of people who pay lip service to the &quot;We&#x27;re all equal&quot; party line but snicker at women in leadership positions. And, sadly, it&#x27;s justified in many cases. This aforementioned double standard also get applied to promotion along with daily life, and it&#x27;s a kick in the teeth when you&#x27;re a lance corporal obeying a corporal who is, by all objective measures, a worse Marine than you. That applies to either gender, but it just so happens that due to affirmative action, there are a lot of women in leadership positions who have no business being there. Couple that with the fact that women make just over 6% of the Marine Corps, (small sample size) and you get sexism.<p>I don&#x27;t really feel like going into the sexual harassment / assault part and the fraternization, as that&#x27;s just shitty behavior that can be remedied by court-martialing people and setting a clear standard. In any case, the real problem is the double standard. If you apply a double standard, then you get sexism. If you hold everyone accountable, then you get genuine respect. Doing so, however, would drastically decrease the number of women in the military. I personally think that&#x27;s a good thing if it means that the remainder are respected and valued.",1374172134

6065472,comment,6062876,6065129,4,0,kenbellows,,,"SO has always had a very specific purpose in mind, and this has been advocated by Jeff Atwood, et al since the beginning. It was <i>never</i> meant to be a discussion based site. In fact, to quote the man himself,<p>&quot;At Stack Exchange, one of the tricky things we learned about Q&A is that if your goal is to have an excellent signal to noise ratio, you <i>must</i> suppress discussion. Stack Exchange only supports the absolute minimum amount of discussion necessary to produce great questions and great answers. That&#x27;s why answers get constantly re-ordered by votes, that&#x27;s why comments have limited formatting and length and only a few display, and so forth. Almost every design decision we made was informed by our desire to push discussion down, to inhibit it in every way we could. Spare us the long-winded diatribe, just <i>answer the damn question already</i>.&quot; [0]<p>The <i>entire</i> point of StackOverflow is to answer questions as quickly, accurately, and efficiently as possible. You want more discussion? There&#x27;s a chat room available. You want long, permanent discussion about (e.g.) the merits of various JavaScript frameworks? <i>You&#x27;re on the wrong site</i>.<p>Plain and simple, SO is not (and never was) <i>meant</i> to be &quot;a tool for developers who used it in many different ways&quot;. It was meant to be sued in <i>one</i> way: ask a concrete, specific, real-world question and get one specific answer that will always be correct.<p>Discussions about obsolete frameworks are fine. People still use them. If you are asking a question with a concrete answer that will not change, go for it. And by will not change, I mean that an answer about how to do something in Python 2.6 will never change, even though the version itself has been superseded by Python 2.7 and 3.x. That&#x27;s still the right way to do the thing you want in Python 2.6.<p>Perhaps to most important point you are making is that &quot;this judgement of what is good information and bad information is ... subjective. We have merely replaced flame wars with these debates.&quot; But the thing is, <i>no one is really debating. This question was answered when the site began</i>. Or certainly not long after. SO is a finely tuned machine, really, really good at <i>one</i> thing: answering practical questions in a practical way.<p>In fact, read up on the Coding Horror article referenced above[0]. Jeff Atwood talks about Discourse, a framework he and some other folks are trying to put together to address the need for a really good discussion-based environment. He makes the point that forums are the place where these discussions happen and are saved for posterity, and that&#x27;s how it should be. When talking about the option of Stack Exchange as an online community for discussion, he refers to it as &quot;quite frankly, terrible&quot;, because &quot;We only do strict, focused Q&A there.&quot;<p>That really should put the issue to rest. SO is <i>not</i> a place to have open ended discussions. That&#x27;s what forums are for.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/02/civilized-discourse-construction-kit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/02/civilized-discourse...</a>",1374172059

Now, whether listening to really loud things <i>escalates</i> the hearing loss is probably what you were asking.<p>If a million people were shuffling along a bridge and they all walked gently then the bridge will be damaged minimally, but if a hundred trucks that weigh several tons drive across the bridge then that damage would be quite severe. A million people regularly shuffling every day would be quite damaging over a long period of time, but the effect of a thousand large trucks is far more damaging.<p>My point is, listening to really loud <i>low frequency</i> sounds isn&#x27;t as damaging as listening to really loud <i>high frequency</i> sounds.<p>Now, my comparison is really poor and heavy trucks cause far more damage than people, but the comparison between &#x27;low frequency&#x27; and &#x27;high frequency&#x27; is apt -- high damage to roads comes from high weight concentrated on a small point of impact in the same way that high damage to hearing comes from high frequency sound.",1374171589

6065425,comment,6064128,6064128,2,0,Schuback,,,"I had the unique experience of borrowing a pair of Google Glass for a multi-day hackathon. The very first thing I did was figure out how to develop and install actual Android apps on it, because the &quot;card&quot; system isn&#x27;t conducive to developing interesting applications. Frankly I&#x27;d rather go with a smart watch if cards are all I could do.<p>During my time with Glass I prototyped 3D interactive software where you could load up models of human body parts, physical structures, etc, and swipe the side to rotate them around and view from all angles. This ran pretty well on the embedded processor, and I was importing relatively large 3D models.<p>As well, I tried running computer vision algorithms on the device. This did not go so well. I could not run a basic Canny edge detection algorithm at more than 1 FPS. FYI this algorithm - and similarly complex ones - are fundamental to doing anything remotely useful in image processing. The alternative is doing all your image processing offline, which may be fine in the future as internet becomes super fast. Some people are doing facial recognition like this, at a whopping 2 FPS.<p>About the product. There&#x27;s the issue of the screen size. Small, hard to focus on, and up to the right. Not really conducive to augmenting your vision. I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Glass was meant as an information retrieval device - which again, makes me wonder, why not just use a smart watch? Frankly I think the screen quality could be better on the watch too.<p>All in all, the platform is an interesting foray into wearable computing but I reckon it will take multiple iterations (and years) to get it to the point where I can run more interesting CV and AR applications. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve been building my own wearable computing hardware to enable the types of software I want to build. The Alan Kay quote, and all that.",1374171577

6065402,comment,6060351,6061441,1,0,epidemian,,,"> what does happen from time to time is that f will look for custom methods on v that are at least logically equivalent to the static interface type f is declared to expect.<p>Interesting. This kinda sounds good in practice, assuming programmers respect the interface&#x27;s semantics when downcasting. But from a language design point of view it strikes me as a bit hacky al least, and at odds with the &quot;Tell, Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; principle.<p>Couldn&#x27;t this need for downcasting be avoided by allowing something like default method implementations in interfaces? I&#x27;m asking this without any practical knowledge of the Go language; i&#x27;m sure different approaches have been considered, but i&#x27;m interested in understanding the reasons behind the preference for downcasting :)<p>Imagine the Reader interface declared, besides the Read method, a WriteTo method with a default implementation:<p><pre><code>  type Reader interface {
      Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
      WriteTo(w Writer) (n int64, err error) {
          // Default implementation in terms of Read and w.Write 
          // using a buffer just like io.Copy
      }
  }
</code></pre>
Then any type with a <i>Read([]byte) (int, err)</i> could still be referenced as a Reader, and when seen as a Reader one could call the convenient WriteTo method without downcasting. io.Copy could then tell the objects what to do instead of asking them what they are:<p><pre><code>  func Copy(dst Writer, src Reader) (written int64, err error) {
      return src.WriteTo(dst)
  }
</code></pre>
A type that complies with the Reader interface could also implement a specific version of WriteTo if needed for performance reasons.<p>This way not only programmers could avoid resorting to downcasting, but the interfaces would become more explicit: instead Reader being &quot;something with a Read method... and maybe a WriteTo if you want to, but this is not declared in Reader itself&quot; it&#x27;d be &quot;something with a Read method and a default WriteTo mehod&quot;.<p>The downsides of this would be that the dispatch semantics become a bit more complex for having to consider the default implementations, and maybe the interfaces could become more &quot;bloated&quot; (though i think that&#x27;s subjective, as the semantics of an interface like Reader are implicitly mixed up with things like WriterTo; having all the methods in Reader would make that existing coupling more explicit).",1374171339

If you remember (I don&#x27;t because I wasn&#x27;t alive then) during Truman&#x27;s presidency and up until around the 1990s, the U.S. consistently, without failure, used Communism as a scapegoat for instilling fear into the masses and making an international statement. It was only oh-so-convenient that Communist regimes tended to be oppressive -- Stalin, Mao, Khrushchev -- why not lead the public to believe ALL Communist regimes are that way?<p>Let&#x27;s prevent freedom of thought, and lead the public to believe that while we actually feel threatened by the idea of communal sharing and the concept of Marxism, which we feel is harmful to the kickbacks that we receive from corporations to do what we want, Communism is actually just another word for an oppressive regime, and not a political concept derived by a highly intelligent German philosopher that has enormous benefits worldwide.<p>So, here&#x27;s the plan: we invade &#x27;Nam. If they&#x27;re the first communist regime that actually works, the public will know we&#x27;ve been lying to them.<p>Shit, that didn&#x27;t work. Okay, so there&#x27;s this pretty harmless socialist dude running for office in Chile, let&#x27;s call him a communist and make an example out of him.

You shouldn&#x27;t need more than one partition; they&#x27;re getting rid of separate /var (I only half joke; after they broke separate /usr by linking boot/system things to it, they declared separate /usr to be &quot;deprecated&quot;).<p><i>If you support more than one operating system,</i><p>Another one of Poettering&#x27;s favorite ideas is that nothing besides Linux matters. I may agree with him for my own personal computing setup, I think it&#x27;s flat out unprofessional to eschew portability and cross-platform standards. Even ignoring the obvious benefits, making things portable can reveal bugs and unstated assumptions in your design which will trip you up later.<p><i>It doesn&#x27;t seem like there is any need to remove syslog. The guy just wants it to disappear.</i><p>If there&#x27;s one thing that strikes me about Lennart (and others, such as those working on Wayland), it&#x27;s what appears to be a severe case of myopia, or just flat out willful ignorance, of systems that have come before. The egotism is astounding.<p>Granted, sound under Linux was far from perfect (so I&#x27;ve heard; it has always just worked for me), and PulseAudio <i>eventually</i> got stable and efficient enough to be be acceptable. That being said, it does feel a whole lot like &quot;here&#x27;s how we&#x27;re going to do it, shut up and take it.&quot; It would be more palatable if they identified problems, proposed solutions, and then canvassed the community. Hell, even just proposing solutions as patches or wholly separate projects and letting the community vote with their feet would be preferable to this dictatorship mentality.<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I distrust Lennart (and Sievers&#x27;) approach to system software because they don&#x27;t seem to think of the bigger picture or be aware of the past. Do you know <i>why</i> so many people are attached to the &quot;legacy&quot; &quot;deprecated&quot; ways of doing things? Because they work, across multiple platforms, multiple OSes and multiple paradigms (embedded, server, desktop, cluster, mobile, and future ones we can&#x27;t even imagine). Because other ways have been tried (eg, binary logging on Windows) and failed. Yes, some things could be improved (dependency based boot is a good idea).

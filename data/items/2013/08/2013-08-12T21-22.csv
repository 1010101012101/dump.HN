6202383,comment,6202379,6202379,1,0,k1w1,,,"I am the lead developer on Aha!. We built it to help product managers and developers collaborate on features and roadmaps. We have been working around the clock (well, almost) for the last few months and today we finally allowed open signups. We ran a private beta (<a href=""http://blog.aha.io/index.php/great-beta-programs-a-contrarian-view"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.aha.io/index.php/great-beta-programs-a-contraria...</a>) and got lots of great feedback from a group of really engaged users. This was a big change from my previous startup where we ran an open beta and had thousands of users, but little useful feedback.<p>I have been writing Ruby on Rails applications for a long time now, but it was a real pleasure to start from scratch using the latest version, and all the wonderful gems that are now available.<p>We wanted the UI to feel really responsive, and to allow almost real-time collaboration by multiple people. The underlying technology is Rails, with as little Javascript/CoffeeScript as possible, but with extensive use of Faye (<a href=""http://faye.jcoglan.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faye.jcoglan.com/</a>) to enable real-time notifications between users, and also to update the screen of the current user in response to their own changes. This allowed us to focus more energy on the Rails backend, and put all the business logic in one place without giving up the real-time user experience that a Javascript framework provides.<p>Between Faye and Rails&#x27; Turbolinks, I&#x27;ve been really pleased with how easy it is now to get great performance out of a Rails app.",1376344774

For most people, trading some data for better ads and free services is a deal that they&#x27;re willing to make - most people don&#x27;t have the mentality of RMS. I might be willing to trade some data about myself voluntarily so I&#x27;ll see some ads about products I might actually buy instead of ads for viagra and other penis-related things.<p>What Facebook and Google is doing here would not be nearly as troubling without this NSA data collection stuff. As annoying as online advertising can sometimes be, generally that information that companies gather about people from online ads isn&#x27;t going to wreck anybody&#x27;s life in any serious way and there are always ad-blockers and things to use to limit that if a site is annoying you.<p>But if the NSA&#x27;s algorithms use some random meta-data and Facebook likes and search keywords to somehow determine that you&#x27;re a potential &quot;terrorist sympathizer&quot; or something and you get placed on some no-fly or watch list with no recourse, that can put your livelihood or ultimately even your life in danger. We don&#x27;t yet know the full extent of these programs or how the data is used and I&#x27;m not trusting the same politicians that hid this from us and lied to us and have always lied to us for more power.<p>The groundwork is in place for the next politicians that come into power that are unlimited by ambition to create a nearly perfect political dictatorship.

Here, you&#x27;re not charging for additional bandwidth, but you&#x27;re also telling people not to run anything that will saturate more than the amount you&#x27;re guaranteeing them.

For example, you can put railway tracks up on pylons, too, with very little impact on the ground. It is common to do this in urban areas, but it is rarely done in rural areas because it is flat out cheaper to put it on the ground. I don&#x27;t believe that an experimental tube is going to be somehow magically cheaper and easier to route and build than train tracks.<p>Now, I am not trying to defend California&#x27;s HSR, specifically. I agree with Musk that it appears to be very poorly done. However, the answer, to my mind, is to do it properly rather than propose a wild experiment with hand-wavy arguments as to why it would be politically easier to do. Do you really think the special interests that are making HSR so difficult and expensive would say, &quot;Oh, do whatever you like with your tube.&quot;?<p>Now, in an attempt to end on a positive note, I do like his proposal as a possible next step beyond HSR. Rail can go up to 350km/h currently (perhaps more in the future--why wouldn&#x27;t California design with this goal in mind?), but Musk&#x27;s hyperloop is proposed up to ~1000km/hr.

Assuming it&#x27;s as cheap and easy to operate as it seems, I really want the Hyperloop to succeed and be installed in as many metro areas as possible, but for the Hyperloop to succeed, it has to be resilient and not overly optimistic, and not assume everyone onboard will sit and stay still for the whole trip.<p>Humans don&#x27;t always behave as they&#x27;re expected to by the engineers of a system. That happens in software, happens in hardware, and in public transportation too.<p>[EDIT]
I think these paragraphs give an idea of how an incident would be handled:<p>>If a capsule were somehow to become stranded, capsules ahead would continue their journeys to the destination unaffected. Capsules behind the stranded one would be automatically instructed to deploy their emergency mechanical braking systems. Once all capsules behind the stranded capsule had been safely brought to rest, capsules would drive themselves to safety using small onboard electric motors to power deployed wheels.<p>>All capsules would be equipped with a reserve air supply great enough to ensure the safety of all passengers for a worst case scenario event.<p>>In the event of a large scale leak, pressure sensors located along the tube would automatically communicate with all capsules to deploy their emergency mechanical braking systems.<p>>Hyperloop would feature the same high level of security used at airports. However, the regular departure of Hyperloop capsules would result in a steadier and faster flow of passengers through security screening compared to
airports. Tubes located on pylons would limit access to the critical elements of the system. Multiple redundant power sources and vacuum pumps would limit the impact of any single element.",1376342727

Why don&#x27;t we quote the whole thesis instead of the caveats after the main thesis?<p>&#x27;The rule of law (also known as nomocracy) generally refers to the influence and authority of law within society, especially as a constraint upon behavior, including behavior of government officials.[2] This phrase is also sometimes used in other senses.[3]<p>In its general sense, the phrase can be traced back to the 16th century, and it was popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. The concept was familiar to ancient philosophers such as Aristotle, who wrote &quot;Law should govern&quot;.[4] Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for example by divine right.<p>Despite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been described as &quot;an exceedingly elusive notion&quot;[5] giving rise to a &quot;rampant divergence of understandings ... everyone is for it but have contrasting convictions about what it is.&quot;[6]<p>At least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a formalist or &quot;thin&quot; definition, and a substantive or &quot;thick&quot; definition. Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the &quot;justness&quot; of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law. Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, the rule of law.[7]&#x27;",1376342564

If you frequent small locations, it becomes clear pretty quickly that the business owners really do love regulars.<p>If preferring repeat customers was actually bad for business, the business owner would be well within their rights to forbid tipping at their business and instead pay their staff the proper minimum wage.  I suspect this isn&#x27;t ever actually the case; either repeat business makes up a significant chunk of your business and is more valuable for its reliability, or your business is so touristy that the occasional regular getting better service has no significant impact.

The compiler will then check for you that you actually deal with both cases. Better yet, one of the type constructors for Either is traditionally reserved as an error case, so it again correctly flags the code as always branching in the same direction barring an exceptional case.<p>Your Python example is a canonical use case for the Maybe/Option type.

10321604,comment,10320109,10321320,0,0,gavazzy,,,"There is likely a combination of social and genetic factors; while the social factors mentioned in the article affect the rates of alcoholism, there is a significant genetic component, which the article claims has no evidence, but ignores the evidence that exists!<p>Alcohol metabolism in humans varies among populations, with some having a greater capability to metabolize it. The article fails to even mention the purported genetic causes (lack of ADH or ALDH), which would seem to be important if you are going to claim that the existing evidence is wrong.<p>That genetics affects rates of alcoholism is not a controversial opinion: the NIH has a report on the variance caused by genetics ( <a href=""http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh301/3-4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh301/3-4.htm</a> ), noting that &quot;Native Americans and Alaskan Natives are five times more likely than other ethnicities in the United States to die of alcohol-related causes. Native Americans are predisposed to alcoholism because of differences in the way they metabolize alcohol.&quot;<p>This makes sense when you consider the environment of the social sciences today, which favors nurture over nature. Anything that is influenced by social interaction (e.g. stress causing alcoholism) must be caused by it, even if there actually are genetic influences.
Unfortunately, there is a cost to the emphasis on social interaction. Suppose that some people have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism, but they believe that it is caused only by social factors. Then they will be more inclined to put themselves at risk by drinking with friends.<p>(A similar argument for genetic testing can be made for the APOE gene, which modulates risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s from drinking. For instance, people with APOE 2/2 are LESS likely to get Alzheimer&#x27;s if they drink, while those with APOE 4/4 are MORE likely to get Alzheimer&#x27;s. Claiming that Alzheimer&#x27;s is caused merely by social interaction while ignoring this genetic effect leads to everyone being worse off).",1443823135

I would have agreed with you prior to that.<p>I managed to get over it relatively quickly, with several realizations.<p>The hurt I felt, wasn&#x27;t that love was lost, but that I no longer had a place for all the love I had. This leads to the understanding that love cannot be lost, it&#x27;s a resource inside us all, and we just have to find other means to redirect it.<p>To think of love, from the perspective of a single entity, leads to the kind of thinking of it being worthless. But the shared love that we think of romantically is coming from a multitude of entities, it isn&#x27;t lost but as a resource redistributed elsewhere.<p>In death love is truly lost on one side, but is also somewhat immortalized on the other. This solidification of love, is similar to the concept of heartbreak, we don&#x27;t want to share that love, but the easiest way to free ourselves of the pain is to love.<p>Love is something you create and give. It can&#x27;t really be lost, because every day is another day to create or find something to love. You have to separate the concept of love from the entities and relationships.<p>I still love her, always will, but I had to say goodbye to the friendship because trying to hold onto her was doing exactly what you said. It was killing me, trying to hold on to the relationship, as she started moving on with another. I realized that they deserved a chance, she was chosing to move on with her life and love. That hurt, but what hurt the most was that I couldn&#x27;t share my love with her any more without possibly alienating him and the love he gave.<p>I realized those things about love coming from inside and being okay with moving on and focusing on things and others. Accepting that love and care sometimes require sacrifices of ourselves for the good of others.",1443823088

In fact, people have different ways of getting around, and those without cars are even forced to find other ways of getting around.

That&#x27;s roughly 3 to 5 times slower than the other algorithms. However, decoding a partial (lossy) file is much faster than decoding everything, so in a progressive decoding scenario, the difference would not be huge.<p>There&#x27;s still room for optimizing the encode/decode speed, but it&#x27;s not very useful to do that before the bitstream is somewhat finalized. The prototype implementation I have now is not extremely fast, but at least it&#x27;s in the right ballpark. Most likely even an optimized decoder will still be slower than an optimized PNG decoder, but the difference will be small enough to not matter much (certainly compared to the time won by downloading less bytes).

Voyaging through the DC-NY Megalopolis would cost about $15.<p>It now costs about $70.<p>What&#x27;s worse, most intra-city travel is or will eventually be pay-per-use. This is already happening in DC and other large US cities, as major throughways are first converted to HOA lanes (2 or three users/auto), and then fully transitioned to completely tolled. Pay up or sit in traffic.<p>For example, within about a 15 mile radius of DC&#x27;s Beltway, I get charged about $35 / week for my basic commute and one or two trips into the District. This is using only about 8 gallons of gas. Coworkers that must take certain costly routes (on privatized tolls no less) pay easily triple that.<p>Essentially, this is just another &#x27;tax&#x27; or wealth transfer between young and old, IMO, that governments have added to cover up the collapsing local financial pyramids.",1443821747

Often when they drink they get carried away and drink to excess for the session. They often don&#x27;t just sit and chat while doing it but engage in some fairly crazy behavior like turning over cars etc. Alcohol does appear to affect them differently and it&#x27;s not &quot;alcoholism&quot; like someone&#x27;s Anglo uncle who sits in front of the TV quietly downing a fifth of scotch every night until his liver gives out. In my limited observations, it&#x27;s more like a group of 16 year old getting blind drunk down by the river in the effects it produces.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all environmental.

Go to any reservation and look at the incidents of diabetes and obesity.

So did all the neighbor kids. Sometimes, a bunch of kids would get together and build an earthen dam across the creek. My dad would call us home using a hunting horn. I went where I wanted in my neighborhood. My parents knew where I was, generally, but that didn&#x27;t mean they could readily physically locate me. So they called us home with the horn, which we could hear anywhere in the woods.<p>That kind of thing would get social services called on you today.",1443819717

It&#x27;s not a uniquely American phenomenon. It&#x27;s still happening in many places today.<p>I think we need to stop leaning on past atrocities (without endorsing or excusing them in any way) as an excuse for not being responsible adults in the here and now. We can&#x27;t change the past, we can only live the best life we can going forwards.",1443819701

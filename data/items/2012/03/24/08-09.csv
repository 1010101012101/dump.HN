People want to compare student and school and district performance, and standardized testing is how they're going to measure that.<p>It doesn't really matter if it ""works"" or not, the decision making behind it is not logical, and it never will be.<p>I'm not saying to center the teaching on the test, but to teach around them.  The tests are here to stay. You have to do well on them.  This is not something there is a choice about.  But that doesn't mean you can't do well on the test and at the same time teach around it.  Not for it, around it.<p>Also, that's a strange idea that history is about rote memorization and not about understanding.  Maybe I got lucky with my history teachers, but for me it was all about understanding how it all fit together, not raw facts.",1332579511

3748888,comment,3748401,3748868,4,0,NaOH,,,"<i>I'm curious - do you happen to know whether the essay portions ever offered any actual statistical utility above and beyond the multiple choice ones? As in, do they actually measure anything that the multiple choice questions can't?</i><p>I believe written assessments were relatively new to standardized tests when I was in the field. My understanding was that the purpose was to assess writing, just like we do with, say, math or reading comprehension. Multiple-choice questions can't evaluate a student's ability to respond to an open-ended question, convey ideas, stay on topic, demonstrate grammar and punctuation, etc.<p>But I didn't get the impression that adding writing components to the test added anything of practical value. Sure, it's one more score-based judgment that can be assigned to each student and be used to assess schools and districts, but as far as I could tell it wasn't benefitting student education. And it certainly came with a high price tag. But I was definitely not in classrooms, so that's a key caveat to anything I share.<p>Does writing seem any better? Well, these written assessments have been widespread for about 20 years or so. I don't get the sense from what I see that people nowadays are generally good writers. But my exposure is certainly limited, even if others I speak to seem to agree, and I'm not certain if enough time has elapsed whereby we would broadly see the effects of such a change in educational assessment.",1332579291

3748886,comment,3748401,3748845,8,0,saulrh,,,"<p><pre><code>  I've long been out of the field\n</code></pre>\nSpeaking as someone that came out of high school a couple years ago and watched No Child Left Behind start taking effect, I've seen two different styles of test: one from the mid-90's, when it sounds like you were involved, and one from after No Child Left Behind. The NCLB tests today are utterly unlike the tests that your methods produced. Basically, instead of trying to rank students against each other, they began ranking every student against the same fixed hurdles. On top of that, they started testing once every year or two rather than once every four or five years, and question quality dropped precipitously as they just ran out of material. The changes were, to me, obvious, and the effects were disastrous. Null-value questions (""What shape is the end of a pencil? Cone, square, pyramid."", on a 7th-grade test), bad and wrong essays (as described in the OP), science questions that asked for rote memorization rather than actual understanding and thinking, and so on.<p>These observations, though amateur and unscientific, suggest a few solutions. Basically, go back to relative rankings, do a <i>lot</i> less testing, and start rewarding uniqueness. Teachers need to have time to actually teach outside hitting every checkbox on list for the end-of-the-year test. Teachers need to be able to teach to their own students, rather than to the lowest-common-denominator child in rural Alabama. Teachers need to be able to encourange and guide every student individually, developing artists, scientists, thinkers, and doers, rather than having to force every single child into the same standardized mold.<p></rant>",1332579014

3748868,comment,3748401,3748756,5,0,bermanoid,,,"<i>The other big challenge to this work was the repetition. Reading the answers to the same questions over and over was mentally challenging for people. I don't blame them. Most kids of a specific age aren't too creative when fed a question for a state test. For example, ask them who is a public figure they admire and why, and you're likely to get the bulk of the answers focusing on just a few people (athletes, popular music stars, etc.). For the written assessments, 10% of the student materials were scored twice (by separate people) to ensure accuracy of grades and as a way to identify issues with potential scorers.</i><p>I'm curious - do you happen to know whether the essay portions ever offered any actual statistical utility above and beyond the multiple choice ones? As in, do they actually measure anything that the multiple choice questions can't?<p>I spent several years teaching SAT and GRE classes, I always noticed that I could predict people's essay scores pretty accurately based on their multiple choice scores. Percentile ranks always tended to be very close between the sections, which always made me wonder whether there was any point in having the essay at all. I always suspected that since the overall level of competence was so low on the SAT (sadly, the GRE was not all that much better...), anyone that was writing at the level where <i>actual</i> quality of writing matters was already scoring top marks on the essay, so they were essentially unmeasured by the scale.<p>I realize that when it comes to setting up these tests, ""include an essay"" is likely a political mandate, because people for some reason think that essay sections are ""more fair"" to ""bad testers"" or ""fluid thinkers"" or something like that (I'm pretty sure ETS was more or less forced to include an essay for this reason), so it probably wasn't even an option not to include them. But I'd be curious to know whether anyone ever looked into whether they actually told you anything you didn't already know. ETS does not provide this data or analysis, otherwise I'd check it myself as it relates to the SAT.",1332578103

3748857,comment,3748401,3748700,2,0,bermanoid,,,"My compensation is not determined by a hard metric because my employer has no way of measuring my direct contribution to the company's profits. If they did, you can be sure they'd pay me accordingly; this is why people in sales are often paid on commission, and why people in ""billable hour"" fields are scolded or fired if they don't hit their billing targets. In performance reviews, or (in my current line of work) consulting, it's not uncommon at all to bring up any and all evidence that you can think of to support a claim that you have (or will) contributed positively to the company's bottom line.<p>Granted, we lack such a clear measure of success in education, and current standardized tests are a ham-fisted approach to creating one. Don't get me wrong - most of the standardized tests we use today follow the exact same approach to testing as they did 50 years ago, and whatever it is that we would like to measure when we say ""educational progress"", they no more accurately capture it now than they did then.<p>But I'm not convinced that the general idea of measuring education through testing is wrong. I think what most anti-testing people balk at is the particular (and extremely limited) set of knowledge that most standardized tests measure - they tend to be more okay with the idea of measuring mastery of a particular subject (either through in-class tests, or even standardized subject tests, which draw <i>far</i> less criticism than the general tests).

558002,comment,557772,557881,0,0,skolor,,,"While the control issue does have some relevance, I think that Omaha is definitely a step in the right direction. I typically put off updating any of my products, simply because they notify me about it instead of just doing the update in the background. I always want the new versions, especially since so many of my browser/OS updates are security updates, but because I'm always notified about it when I either start the application, or when I close it, I never want to do it and spend extra time waiting while it does the update process when I had something in mind I wanted to do.<p>Making it open source is definitely the right direction. If it gets modified so that there is a control panel of sorts so that you an control the updates I think it will be considerably better for people.If it is set up as it is now (Updating at some time of low computer usage), with options that can be changed to only update through a specific connection, to only update when the computer has been idle for X amount of time, and similar times.<p>Look at the recent Conficker worm. There are estimates that over 10 million computers were infected with it (and are now having that annoying fake antivirus software downloaded onto it), because they hadn't installed a security update that was published in October. If they would just push the update after 1-2 months (Assuming that no major problems have been reported) to all Windows computers, much of the spread and potential damage would have been avoided. Since you use a Mac, you might not be used to this kind of problem. Windows always has some sort of a security hole, which is constantly being exploited. Anyone in IT can tell you how much of their time would be saved if Microsoft would stop nagging users about the security updates and just install them after they've been verified as stable. At the end of March we lost quite a bit of time having to scan all of the machines, and then going out and removing it from the one that had been infected, all because a higher up had heard about Conficker and was worried about what might happen on 4/1.",1239496801

558000,comment,557618,557618,0,0,bbg,,,"Pullum makes some good points -- his objection to the irrelevant distinction between 'that' and 'which' is apt -- but I believe that his starkly opinionated denunciation reeks of silly academic spleen and ultimately mischaracterizes this concise, helpful, and even beautiful little book.<p>First, although Pullum inveighs against Strunk and White, he tends to direct his barbs not toward the book itself, but toward writing teachers.  For example:<p>""Sadly, writing tutors tend to ignore this moderation, and simply red-circle everything that looks like a passive....""<p>This mode of criticism is rather like blaming the Bible for the sins of the Inquisition -- you can do it, but your criticism falters right away by missing the true target.<p>Where Pullum does criticize the book itself, he accuses it of harboring a fussy and decontextualized view of language.  Unfortunately, this very criticism can be directed back at Pullum.  For example, when he criticizes the absence of a passive verb in this sentence:<p>""There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground"",<p>Pullum ignores Strunk and White's elegant and concise rephrase:<p>""Dead leaves covered the ground.""<p>Here, ""covered"", an active, transitive verb taking the direct object ""ground"", conveys vividly what the verbose and pale construction ""were lying"", coupled with the prepositional phrase ""on the ground"", does not.  Pullum's fussiness about the meaning of the word ""passive"" obscures S&W's point: vividness and brevity come together nicely in the active construction.<p>Pullum falls into an abyss of self-contradiction when he concludes Strunk and White do not understand grammar:<p>""But despite the ""Style"" in the title, much in the book relates to grammar, and the advice on that topic does real damage. It is atrocious. Since today it provides just about all of the grammar instruction most Americans ever get, that is something of a tragedy.""<p>Once again Pullum faults The Elements for the sins of its followers, not for its own qualities.  But what is most important here is that Pullum first argues (implausibly) that The Elements is a grammar book, and then (incomprehensibly) accuses S&W of having written about grammar when they should have confined themselves to writing about style!<p>Finally, Pullum uncharitably criticizes The Elements as a ""bunch of trivial don't-do-this prescriptions.""  He ignores the fact that S&W explicitly recommend that writers ""Put statements in positive form"" (section II.19), and follow through on this prescription themselves when they recommend such practices as: ""Use definite, specific, concrete language,"" ""Keep related words together,"" and ""Omit needless words.""<p>(Pullum criticizes this last recommendation on the ground that it unhelpfully fails to show which words are needless.  Once again, Pullum fails to cite S&W's paragraph-long discussion of the matter or to recognize that they offer over a dozen illustrative examples.)<p>To be sure, the Elements is not a perfect book.  For one thing, language is not a static object admitting of a timeless description.  Furthermore, I would not argue that everyone should use The Elements as guiding light; ""de gustibus non disputandum,"" as Cicero said, about tastes there can be no argument (meaning that tastes do not admit of rational arguments).  So if you don't like the book, fine.  Still, Pullum's blinkered mischaracterization of the book serves only to get him another publication in his CV, not to enlighten his readership.  Although I may be blinkered myself by having grown to love this book in college, I wholeheartedly recommend it as one of the finest and most timeless style manuals available.",1239496530

557989,comment,557959,557959,0,0,gruseom,,,"That's totally wrong. The point of this style of programming is allow a series of function calls to be written as a linear chain of expressions. It comes from Smalltalk via Eric Evans, who popularized it in the Java world (<a href=""http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html</a>). This style is favored by people who agree that side effects should be avoided but who don't like to build functional expressions with many levels of nesting (à la Lisp). Evans compared these composite linear expressions to noun phrases in English and argued that they can be a more natural way to express domain concepts in code.<p>The ""with"" control structure only resembles this in the degenerate case where every expression in the chain evaluates to <i>the exact same object</i>. Not only that, the ""with"" keyword expects a series of statements (as opposed to expressions), and that is the exact opposite of what the chaining style is about. This is easily seen in the author's own example: each member of the sequence has to end in a semicolon (i.e. is a statement rather than an expression), so you don't have a single composite expression at all, only a slightly more compact procedural script.",1239495900

557985,comment,557659,557825,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree with you in the short term.  But I think that the long term absence of employable Americans may be caused, in part, by the programs that make it easy to hire foreign nationals instead of Americans in engineering and science.<p>There are a lot of really smart Americans working in law, finance, medicine, and so forth.  Do you think these folks are too dumb to work in software?  Or are they just rationally responding to a market glut, driven in part by the presence of the H1B program?<p>I think our policy has driven young Americans out of engineering.  To just consider the few Americans who did get these degrees is shortsighted.  You have to consider the eighth graders, high school students, and first year college students who have been deterred from entering the field.  Because we controlled the wages of engineers with a visa program, but not finance or legal professionals, we deterred our own from going into these fields (creating a more severe shortage, necessitating more visas, creating an even worse shortage, until we had finally reached the point where Americans were no longer even remotely interested in this field).<p>Basically, America ""foreignized"" engineering to the point where we no longer have a home grown, self sustaining engineering profession.  This has left us extremely vulnerable - even if we <i>do</i> offer the visas, there's no guarantee we can staff these jobs in the US anymore.<p>By the way, I do think that a robust home-grown engineering field would be enhanced by the presence of many foreign born practitioners.  But I think we pushed it to the point where actively undermined the careers of young Americans in engineering, and the next wave of students voted with their feet.<p>Yes, allow in talented engineers.  No, don't leave the level so high that Americans are deterred.

""Required"" is a strong word, implying that it is <i>impossible</i> to become religious through any other process than the one you assume.<p>But the data shows otherwise.  People become religious through a lot of very different processes.  Some are drawn emotionally, others intellectually.  Some are drawn by the religious community and by ""fitting in"", others by scholarly writings.  Some are drawn because they don't like looking at evidence, others are drawn because they are dedicated to looking at evidence.  Some may begin from premises that are not falsifiable, but it's quite a stretch to say that's <i>required</i>.<p>> <i>""if you're a deist, you wouldn't need to think that evolution isn't the sole source of biological diversity on Earth""</i><p>You don't need to think that even if you're a total Bible-thumper.  As long as your Bible-thumping includes an appropriate understanding of history, such that you recognize the creation story as a response to the Egyptian creation account [0], rather than as a response to Darwin.<p>[0] <a href=""http://transformedthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/08/genesis-1-introduction-to-theology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transformedthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/08/genesis-1-in...</a>",1339354795

If you invite <i>n</i> friends, you have <i>n+1</i> votes. Since each of your invites also gets a vote, there are <i>(n+1) + n</i> votes total, or <i>2n + 1</i>.<p>So, for a given n, your chances of winning is <i>(n+1)/(2n+1)</i> . The limit of <i>(n+1)/(2n+1)</i> as n->infinity isn't 1, as the graph implies; it's 1/2. (<a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=limit%20%28n%2B1%29%2F%282n%2B1%29%20as%20n%20goes%20to%20infinity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=limit%20%28n%2B1%29%2F%...</a>).

For two friends, you're at 3/5; for three, 4/7, etc. Note that we're <i>above</i> 50%, so the delta in your chance of winning is actually <i>negative</i> for each friend you invite.<p>The author is also confused whether you get an initial vote or not, but that's less important. The author didn't seem to count the friends' votes anywhere: ""If two friends sign up, then you have a 2/3 chance of winning, then 3/4, then 4/5, and so on."" If two friends sign up, there are either four or five votes total, neither of which is divisible by three, as that sentence states.<p>But the author's final conclusion is correct -- at least, it's close enough; you want to share with your friends such that they have enough time to enter the contest, but not enough time to share withe their friends. The appropriate time, of course, varies per-friend.",1339354642

4091833,comment,4091462,4091723,4,0,tluyben2,,,"Yeah for a startup that is kind of true; it depends a bit on what it is, but generally 'doing a startup' is costly. I wouldn't say those mandatory social insurance and other things are very different in different countries (depending on your bootstrapping wallet size). However if you don't go for those typical growths of startups and you just want a few million $ in the end (I guess, according to Wikipedia, that's not a startup), it is not so hard to bootstrap and build + make a good living. I don't particularly need rocket ship money.<p>As an example; my wife and I started a dating site in one EU country (which was crowded with dating sites) for (in the beginning) around $150/month hosting and 'free' programming (I spent a few weeks on it in my spare time). We spent $250 on marketing and after around 6 months it made more than I made from my other company with almost no work (30-60 min/day). Sold it for very nice money (no mortgage); did a few of those kind of things and invested (part) of the money in 'bigger' things with actually employees. I often like that of model a lot better than stories on HN; simply reasoned; there are only a few Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest like companies; the chance that your millions $ VC company makes it is not that large. It's make or break otherwise the VC multiplier is not large enough.<p>I think to bootstrap, depending on your company, you need the right group of people and the idea depends on those people. If your wife happens to know <i>all</i> the press in your country, it's far easier to bootstrap a number of companies than when you have to hire PR companies. It's your job as entrepreneur to gather people around you who will help you.<p>So while I agree with your ; for a typical startup you need a lot of resources to get off the ground, but for any kind of business; nah. It depends on your dreams, but if you just want to supplement or replace your income (or work more or less), it's not that hard.",1339354607

If you have a girl then you now have <i>0</i> grandchildren to help you when you're old, thus logically causing you to save even <i>more</i> than you would have.<p>>The savings rate is due to thousands of years of constant invasion, mass slaughter, starvation and death. Look through Chinese history and you will see more than a few ""mass extinctions"" (80%+ death rates). This leads to a saving mentality, it's embedded in the culture (and not a new thing at all).<p>Europe has had near extinction events and invasions as well, so I don't think you can really just point to that as the total explanation.<p>Additionally from what I've read Chinese savings rates have been increasing, so it can't be explained as merely cultural.<p>>Personal savings are not at all used in this way.<p>How are banks investing the money, then?

Social Media is here, has been here for a while and is only going to continue to get bigger and bigger. You have to understand how it works and how to use it effectively to help you in your own business.<p>Let us take the daddy of them all at the moment Facebook. Some statistics for 2012 for this behemoth gives you an insight into the sheer scale of Social Media: In 2012 there are 850 million users, of those 50% are Mobile users. The percentage of men and women is split 43% Male, 57% Female. On average women have 55% more posts on their wall than men.<p>So far there has been more than 1 million websites integrated with Facebook, people interact with over 900 million objects, Facebook has 3 million active fan pages today and there are over 100 Billion friendships.<p>Every day 1 billion pieces of content / information is shared through photos, videos, web links, new stories etc.<p>In the world of business 80% of companies are using Facebook as a marketing tool. 39% of business owners said they plan to spend money on Facebook marketing in 2012. Facebook is the Number 1 publisher of display ads, that is more than Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and AOL combined.<p>Facebook users are up to 150 times more likely to consume branded content in the newsfeed than to visit the actual fan page itself.<p>As you can see from some of these statistics, Facebook and Social Media has become an integral part of any serious business. The huge mistake many make is not actually knowing how to utilize this huge resource properly. What are the steps to take to use it correctly when it comes to your own business? What do you need to do it put the strategies into place to help? How do you integrate Social Media and your business to make it one organic entity?<p>With correct understanding and set up you are exposing your business to an audience that has the potential to be limitless.

Because that's what this is - a dream.<p>Print out a pump? OK. Was the 3D printer's performance to all relevant specs validated? Were the materials it uses approved and inspected along with their certificates to be sure the pump was being made from the material the designer specified? Was the material stored properly before use and was the pump it printed tested to ensure that it met all its requirements?<p>The software is probably easier to handle, surprisingly. The FDA probably wouldn't care that it was open source, but would the OSS developers be willing to follow a validated process, document that they are following the process, submit to random audits of that process being followed?<p>Who handles customer complaints? FDA requires that a Medical Device manufacturer have a procedure to record and respond to customer complaints and comments in a timely fashion.

Though it's a noble effort and probably <i>does</i> have a ton of great features, there are some problems: you pretty much get all or nothing (ESK split it out into a ""core"" and ""per-language"" set of libraries but still, there's a lot of stuff) and it's hard to tell which things are emacs builtin and what is customizable.

Use your knowledge of local regulations and how to maneuver them in your advantage. In general: aim to be a country-scoped Stripe versus a country-scoped Pinterest or Twitter.<p>My take (only slightly off-topic): While I emphatically agree with the author on the types of startup one should aim to clone locally, I see little discussion regarding the inherent difficulties of even starting <i>any kind</i> of business in many countries. Mandatory <i>expensive</i> social insurance, high company formation costs, bureaucracy, all make bootstrapping prohibitive. In other words, maybe the problem isn't getting inspiration for the proper kind of startup to clone; it's finding a way to get the ball rolling.",1339352007

Using the recommended interfaces, PB is faster than in their test. It is still slower than msgpack. Not sure why they'd make their test look cooked when they win in a fair test anyway.  Further examination shows that the test is _mainly_ a test of std::string, for protobuf.  std::string is required to use contiguous storage, whilst msgpack's test uses a msgpack-specific rope type.""",1339352005

Yeah, I could see a little bit of taking your comment personally in there but he still makes a good point. Furthermore, your attack of Apple seems just as much like a justification for your own choices as anyone's defense of any platform seems like a justification of theirs. It's really hard to not take this stuff personally, especially for developers, because our choice of platform becomes part of our identity. I don't know of any other profession where you get so close and attached to your tools; choosing them, configuring them, getting an efficient workflow down.

Apple's profits have been rising in that market segment, independent of who currently sells more phones and what OS phones run.<p>Apple now has Verizon support and is available in a lot of international markets.<p>Next the could diversify to different models, if that would help.<p>Apple lives from the focus of integrated hardware and software. But the real strength is the attention to the user.<p>With Android you got Google as the software sponsor, Google as the service provider, Google as the ad platform through which they drive their revenue and you got a multitude of hardware companies using their software.<p>We have seen similar models in the past, where the hardware companies had to pay the software provider their share for the software license. The Google model is indirect.<p>Apple has shown in recent years that they have no problem competing against these business models, even with a tiny market share. Apple does not sell by features or price.<p>My main problem with Apple is not about how their deals with developers or partners work, but that they don't allow me as a user to take full (or 'more') control of the device software.

2299988,comment,2299409,2299549,0,0,thwarted,,,"We use puppet at yelp.  It's okay, but not perfect (we're using 0.25 on a mix of Centos and Ubuntu).  Here are some gotchas and pitfalls I've run into:<p>It uses tremendous amount of memory, both the puppetd clients and the puppetmaster server.  We were experiencing regular crashes (unrelated to memory usage, AFAICT), when we were on 0.24, that we have init/upstart/ubuntu-process-management-du-jour manage it.<p>Puppetmasters seem to stop responding and (from what I can tell from lsof) forget about some file descriptors every so often, and we need to hard-restart them, usually using kill -9.<p>There isn't solid support for distributing files via any method other than the puppet:// scheme (although supporting http is in the works), which means puppetmaster must both evaluate the configuration and serve files, and it doesn't seem like a very efficient when serving files.<p>The documentation is less than stellar.  Valid examples are not included, and there are exceptions to exceptions in the DSL.  For example, the defined() function determines if a class or resource has been defined; for resources you do defined(ResourceType[title]), and for classes you do defined(""class::name"") (defined(Class['class::name']) doesn't work here, even though you specify dependencies using Class[""class::name""] syntax).  I had to find this out by digging deep in the bug tracker and mailing list.  I find the documentation difficult to navigate, there's no unified ""here's the syntax"" document, and there aren't enough indications of which version of puppet supports which language constructs.<p>The certificate management is extremely subpar.  By default the puppet clients connect to a host named puppet.  But the puppetmaster generates certificates with a CN of the hostname of the puppetmaster.  This made setting up multiple, interchangable, load balanced puppetmasters problematic -- the puppet clients then complain that the server identity changed between runs.  The CN of the puppetmasters should be ""puppet"". There are options to override the CN and the Alternative Names when the CA and PM certs are generated, but we had trouble getting them to work -- figuring out the problem was easy once you realize the fields in the certificates were always being generated wrong.  We had to settle on generating a puppetmaster certificate once with the right values, then copying that to all our puppetmasters (really, this is how you manage SSL a cluster of web servers, you don't have a certificate for each web server with its own hostname in the CN, you have one for *.example.com or www.example.com and every server serves that name).  We also had to turn on autosigning and we clean out the certificate store on the puppetmasters periodically to avoid certificate signing conflicts between puppetmasters.  The SSL is a nice feature, and I definitely see it as a necessity for security purposes, but it could be cleaner.<p>You definitely need multiple puppetmasters if you have a largish environment.  I don't consider our environment especially large, but we've had load issues when we ran one puppetmaster.  Even distributing the puppet runs using the splay option didn't help.<p>A guy on my team wrote a function to recursively template a directory of files.  This made mass file management easier, otherwise you need to specify each file individually in a file {} stanza.<p>We have scripted setting up a puppetmaster and a puppet client, and modified the default (I believe ubuntu provided) init.d script to give the command line options related to the next point...<p>I had issues with the defaults specified in the puppet.conf (and puppetd.conf and puppetmaster.conf or something) and the section names in the files (they are in .ini format), and getting the command line to override them.  It's been a while since I had to deal with this (since we worked around it), but there's a thread at <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/puppet-dev@googlegroups.com/msg01776.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mail-archive.com/puppet-dev@googlegroups.com/msg0...</a> about the --config command line option.  Related to this, we run puppetmaster with a config dir of /etc/puppetmaster and a vardir of /var/lib/puppetmaster.  This had made things a lot easier; by default, everything goes in /etc/puppet and /var/lib/puppet, and the files for the puppet client and the puppetmaster get mixed in together when running puppet on the puppetmaster.  Since we've scripted both client config and puppetmaster config, it's easy to just blow one away and recreate it.<p>We didn't used custom facter facts or custom functions on the puppetmaster initially, but I recently setup our environment to support those and if you know ruby (or can muddle through it), it's reasonably easy to extend the capabilities.<p>We mainly use it to distribute files and create user accounts, we've had problems on and off with anything else more advanced (even service management has been a problem at times--things stopping and starting when they shouldn't--but I attribute this to general issues with ubuntu moving to different versions of upstart at times).  Having modules that do things like manage apache config, or sudoers or nagios config might come in handy if you started with it using puppet, but when you're moving an already established config to puppet, it's easier to just distribute the files.  Especially when distributions like ubuntu (debian?) support a subdir of config files for apache that are managed with symlinks.<p>I don't mean to present it like it's all bad.  It has allowed us to centralize and version most of our config and bring new machines into service relatively fast.  We were throwing around using it to configure EC2 instances, but really, I think it would be easier (and faster) to use custom AMIs.  We have not had to do this yet, though.<p>Some of these issues may be fixed in 0.26, we have not gotten around to playing with it yet.<p>So it has its quirks, and it's not so bad if you really spend time learning it and have enough experience to come up with work arounds for where you'll experience pain points -- this is no different than any other software package.  Considering it's what I know and I'm aware of the quirks, I'd use puppet on other networks.  And I'm sure some of the problems we've had with it are because we're doing something non-standard or using it in a unique or unsuggested way.<p>I really should write up some of our recipes to help out other people.",1299563077

However, accounting is more of an art, and you can play games with numbers.  E.g., large companies typically have two sets of books (and are allowed to), one for investors, one for the IRS.  The latter typically makes things look worse so you don't have to pay as much tax.<p>I'm no lawyer, but given the company has investors, I'm pretty sure the SEC can still come after them if they're misleading their investors.

Rather, I think he was critiquing all things transcendent (yeah, Plato and Kant), and trying to show how things and experience would feel transcendent, even if they aren't.<p>I also think he used a lot of irony -- he talks about authenticity, and he sort of means it but he also sort thinks that any personal transcendence is just balderdash; so authenticity is facing both death and the lack of any final answer as to what is authentic.  (All that a Dasein ""is"" is something that wonders what it ""is"".  This self-questioning of being, or ""is-ness"", of both the world and ourselves, is fundamental to the human condition, and is where the ""Being"" of ""Being in Time"" comes from.)<p>Re ecstasis:  He was talking about the phenomenological experience of interacting with the world.  And I interpret ""ecstasis"" to mean ""the process of expansion into the world"" -- sort of getting outside one's ""self"", but with a sort of ironic notion of selfhood.  Again, there is irony and allusion to the classical notion, but recast in his own phenomenology.<p>My rather loose interpetation of Nietzsche is that supposedly nietzschean self assertion is not really Nietzschean at all, but rather naive and foolish and immature.  Zarathustra counsels against going to the city and indulging in pleasure.<p>YMMV -- I am just a guy talking in a bar about these things.",1299561643

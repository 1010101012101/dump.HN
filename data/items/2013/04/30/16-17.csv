But what makes a successful social engineering attack (or scam, in general) is giving people what they want before they have an opportunity to ask questions. While this exact attack wouldn't work on me now, it might have when I was looking to graduate from university. My desire for an industry job (and a prestigious one at that) might have clouded my typical judgment. So, hiding whois information can be immediately justified by ""well, they are a security company"", with any doubts expelled.

I don't know all that much about that stage of the syndrome because I never had any tests at the time. I would get sick, take some of the time off, then get right back to it. Nobody was forcing me.

The point of orphan works legislation is it lets people use works that they're pretty damned sure are orphaned (and which the licensing body agrees) because they've done a diligent search, in the confidence that they can't be sued for copyright infringement if the author pops up later. (Though they may be asked to stop using the work, depends on how the regs end up being written).<p>Point is: copyright infringement is strict liability. This sort of legislation is the closest we're going to get to a true 'due diligence' defence.<p>>  Just use any photograph you want. When asked, claim you did a diligent search and nothing came up.<p>Er, and then be successfully sued by the copyright holder for using the work without a licence?

And this is where Apple is struggling, by viewing software as huge steps with small shuffles in between, they struggle in cases where software development works best as a continuous reasonable walk.</i>""<p>I happened to be traveling in Italy during the last week of iOS 6 beta and the first two weeks of iOS 6 release, and was amazed to see the sudden dramatic improvement in maps on an almost daily basis during that trip.  At the start of the trip, we still preferred the original maps on iOS 5, but by the end of the trip, the iOS 6 maps felt superior in most ways.<p>Apple was clearly updating both the ""cloud"" map data and the map functionality without a point release to iOS itself, and iterating incredibly fast.  Seems to me if the ""new maps"" journalism had been delayed about three more weeks after iOS 6's release, the ""first"" impressions would have been markedly improved.<p>I also believe, based on the types of things that changed, that the iteration was driven by real world mass usage data that Apple just couldn't get from the beta or GM install base who use iPhones differently.",1367340304

I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, ``The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.'' I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html</a>",1367339766

I'm not sure what that means for the relative velocity between the satellite and a stone---probably slower, but by how much?

5633109,comment,5632468,5632468,9,0,bane,,,"Beware, Android has its own share of software problems.<p>Reflecting on this, I've come to the following conclusion, let me motivate it a bit.<p>Jobs was a notable fan of Sony's industrial design in the 80s. But Japan's traditional industrial problem has been poor software despite great hardware. Often software so bad that it brings down an otherwise great piece of hardware.<p>Jobs tried to solve this, great hardware <i>and</i> software, tightly integrated, completes the product. Small details, from the trackpad on a Mac to the clickwheel on an iPod, to the interface on an iPad are all examples of this philosophy.<p>Fundamentally this puts the focus on building a product, the industrial design, the power supply, the BOM and the software (instead of all the previous bits and <i>then</i> later some software). But a product oriented development process means you build the product, ship it, then move on to the next product. You don't really keep revving a product after it ships.<p>But software is a fundamentally different beast. As a discipline it has transformed into a continuous practice instead of a discrete practice like hardware. ""Cloud"" computing, with continuous updates are simply an extension of this understanding. It puts <i>tension</i> into Apple's product focused development practice because it forcibly decouples the software part of product design that Apple has spent so much effort into coupling.<p>I'm not saying Apple never updates its software, to the contrary, Apple software is generally well supported and receives updates. But it feels like it's done in a begrudging kind of way. Major software updates tend to be lockstep released with major new <i>hardware</i> product launches, not independently (and <i>then</i> some older products can be updated with the new software).<p>Contrast to other parts of the computing industry where the system software and hardware are completely decoupled. Which is the better approach? I don't know. Apple's innovation tends to come in huge leaps, followed by slow refinement. It's easy for consumers to keep track of and it seems to have worked well. But then every once in a while competitors will move ahead, and if it's early in an Apple product cycle it can take <i>forever</i> for Apple to reach parity since you have to wait for the next major product release to get the next major software release. It can feel like catching up.<p>Some software development just simply works better with a continuous development process. Maps is a really notable example, all of the data lives outside the product and as the data improves, the product seems to magically improve as well. I think what we're realizing is that voice recognition applications (Siri, Google's Voice Search) benefit from out-of-product improvements to the fundamental algorithms as well.<p>And this is where Apple is struggling, by viewing software as huge steps with small shuffles in between, they struggle in cases where software development works best as a continuous reasonable walk. It can feel like Apple just can't be bothered sometimes while you wait a year or two for the next major product cycle.<p>(comparatively, Google suffers from the opposite, by keeping on their regularly paced march, the product ecosystems ends up horribly confused, you might be able to get the latest google tech on product A, but can you get it on product B? Who knows!? It can be frustrating as a consumer)",1367338871

In other countries with superior medical system integration, like Austria/Germany, this is an accepted medical fact.<p>If you stress out a rat long enough, its adrenal glands will actually bleed. If you stress out a human long enough, you cause first a huge ongoing spike in cortisol etc., and later, a serious drop as the damage is done. This can be measured easily using a 24-hour cortisol saliva or blood test, but it rarely is. (Related hormones: DHEA, thyroid).<p>Symptoms of burnout are just like the symptoms of CFS/low thyroid because they are part of the HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenals) Axis. They're tightly coupled.<p>While short bursts of endorphins will make you feel better, the effect will be temporary. Endorphins will not make your adrenal glands or thyroid work again. Instead, they mask the symptoms but only for a while. There are only three ways to get better: Dramatically cut stress. Wait. Take medication. Pick 2.<p>[1] ""Sub-clinical"" usually means ""not measurable,"" but in the case of ""burnout"" and adrenal fatigue, it is absolutely measurable. However, I call it sub-clinical because of the way most doctors think of the adrenal glands. Most doctors believe that the adrenal glands are binary: they are either working perfectly, or totally non-functional (Addison's disease). Unless you're on the verge of death from lack of cortisol, they will tell you you're fine.<p>If you have burnout, get your 24-hour saliva test. Take your morning temperature with an old-fashioned thermometer under your arm for 10 min. Look up the other symptoms of adrenal fatigue and hypothyroid. There's plenty of research published about how burnout is measurable and related to the HPA axis -- you don't have to take my word for it. There are lots of support groups, too, where the sufferers have often presaged the research.<p>And for god's sake, stop telling yourself it's about failure or investment or whatever and <i>stop stressing yourself out, period</i>, or you can get like I am and it can become <i>permanent</i>.<p>EDIT: If you google ""burnout syndrome"" you will read several sources claiming that there is no proof it's a real thing. This is 100% false. They also say it's not accepted by the medical community, but rather a quacky way to sell supplements. It's true that most doctors are unaware of the research, but the ones who do treat it with real medicine (see below).<p>It's painfully easy to say ""There's no proof"" but a 5-minute search of Google Scholar shows otherwise:<p><a href=""http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/61/2/197.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/61/2/197.short</a> (from 1999!)<p><a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&UID=2005-13290-009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&#38...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399999000070"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399999...</a><p><a href=""http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/62/2/286.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/62/2/286.short</a><p><a href=""http://gimle.fsm.it/28/1s_psi/05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gimle.fsm.it/28/1s_psi/05.pdf</a><p>The theories from doctors who've spent their lifetime researching it go as follows: Burnout happens in stages. In the early stages, cortisol etc. are elevated. In the later stages, the ""fatigue"" sets in, and cortisol is too low. I personally spent 3+ months in low-cortisol hell and it was the most awful time in my life and there have been some really bad times in my life. .<p>And there are quite a lot of endocrinologists etc. who will treat low-testing cortisol patients with hydrocortisone, isocort or florinef or other <i>drugs</i> which are not ""supplements"" by any stretch of the imagination.<p>IF you are stressing yourself out, and IF you keep going down that road, this is what you have to look forward to:<p>Being unable to get out of bed. Being unable to make the simplest of decisions without feeling like you're having a panic attack. Being unable to read, because it's too much information at once. Being unable to watch TV shows that have too many ""facts"" in them. All of the above -- including simple questions of ""What do you want for lunch, honey?"" -- triggered panic-like attacks in me, who'd never had a panic attack despite years of physical and emotional abuse as a child. It was like being surrounded and squeezed and shouted at by a million people all at once, just to try to <i>listen to my lunch options</i>. That is because cortisol is required to rise to the ""stress"" of every day living standing up from sitting is a stress, making decisions, etc., all create tiny spikes of cortisol to help you cope. If your cortisol is too low, you are screwed.<p>Is there any ""victory"" worth a life like that? Can you even call that a life?",1367338478

For example, out of the 10 or so technologies that were judged most risky for JWST, the 6 K cryocooler for the MIRI instrument was the last to be judged ready for space (""at TRL 6"" in the jargon) (<a href=""http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/news/2007/jwst-passes-tnar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/news/2007/jwst-passes-tnar</a>).<p>Despite being judged ready, the JWST cryocooler has proved <i>very</i> challenging to build.  The effort now has frequent reviews with the director of JPL (and a high-level counterpart at NGST), and tens of engineers are now working on the system.<p>Part of the problem, as I understand it, is that the heat has to be taken away and radiated at a site distant from the IR detector.  This requires a large structure, and a deployable radiator.  This large structure can't leak much heat back into the spacecraft bus or instruments, and must not be disturbed by the vibrations of launch.  Additionally, vibrations of the cryocooler must not affect the telescope optics (2 micron resolution).<p>You can tell that these requirements are fundamentally opposed to each other (""be large, don't vibrate, don't touch anything else"").",1367338274

Of course there's a similarity of physical structure that's common to brains that have those experiences. But more from the point of view of if you stumble upon some complex object for example, you could wonder whether it is experiencing the illusion of free will. If that's all purely emergent from known physical laws, we should be able to determine whether a particular object possesses/produces the illusion, right? So, that got me wondering what is the minimal hardware/spatial configuration that could produce this sort of illusion and are illusions actually ""something""? It seems like it's presupposing that certain arrangements of matter generate ""illusions"" and yet we seem to want to insist that at some level these ""illusions"" don't really exist. How far down do illusions go? Some people are born blind or deaf/have strokes, so the illusion of color vision or sound can be isolated and removed from the illusion of consciousness. Do ""and gates"" experience some sort of atomic illusion of ""and""? Can the presence of illusion be tested? Anyway, not sure I'm making a cogent statement, I'm still not entirely clear on what's bothering me about this, but something ""feels"" intuitively wrong/missing to me about the purely physical emergent neuroscience approach now.",1367338089

An email is sent to the email address associated with the id which includes a unique url. This url is randomly generated with 21 characters, generated from 3 different algorithms for randomess generating each 7 characters. The client who receives the email can then click on the link and get a new password for his id. A confirmation email is sent announcing the change of password. In all emails sent, ovh includes the IP of the person who did the request.<p>This is a procedure that was set up 7 years ago and hasn't changed since.<p>On april 26th, we have discovered internely an issue with the function that generates the 21 characters. Two of the three random functions were generating a not-so-random string. It was hence possible to ask for a password change and then to brute-force the password reset url. This problem was found by one of our developpers on apr 26th at 11:03:14 and was fixed at 12:54:13. The origin of this problem was linked to the rand() function used in this part of the code that hasn't been patched to the same level as the rest of the code when we activated the script execution cache (?). We have replaced the old function returning 21 characters from 3 ""random"" functions with a new function using two really random functions each providing 64 characters.<p>We have then started searching in our databases to check if the vulnerability had been exploited, and when it could have been. To do that, we have looked at 3 years of history of password resets. We are authorized by the CNIL (commission nationale informatique et libert, french agency regulating databases containing personnal data) to archive and use all logs for the last 10 years, specifically for this kind of issue.<p>We have found 3 active ids which had a password reset done by brute-force. These three occurences were targeted attacks against a part of the ""bitcoin"" community that uses ovh. The hacker seems to have found the flaw on apr 23rd at 22:00, and did a lot of testing for one hour to make his method work. At 23:00, his method was working and he has hacked the first id, then the two others ids the following day, still for bitcoin related sites. We have been in contact with these clients but the quality of our exchanges did not allow us to get enough information that would help reveal an vulnerability on our side. Our developpers have in a completely independant way found the issue mentionned above, and only then have we realised that there was a link between our flaw and these 3 customers. We certainly have something to learn here about the best way to ensure dialog with clients about this kind of issue.<p>It took us some time to communicate on the subject, because we have quickly realised that the impact was very limited (3 customers) and we wanted to take enough time to verify everything in depth and make sure that this had not impacted any other customers. Having finished our search today going back three years, we can now assert that no other customers have seen this issue. We are going back 10 years now, but the probability that this happened ealier is null.<p>I think that despite the small impact for our customers, it was our duty to inform everybody of this security incident that we had to deal with last week. We have added a code-review process on some very old code that hasn't been rewritten for years, to check that there are no other similar issues. We are also trying to see how we can improve communication with clients for this kind of incident, knowing that 2 of the 3 customers are actually customers of our affiliates/branches.<p>TL;DR :\nYes, we had a security vulnerability allowing a password change using some complex brute-force procedure. We advise all clients running critical services to limit access to the manager from some IP only.\nYes, 3 clients of the bitcoin community have been impacted by this security flaw. It is very important to read the emails that ovh sends automatically, especially the notification of password change emails, when they aren't initiated by you. If you see a request for a password change that you haven't initiated, you should call our incident support 24/24 which will block your account until everything is clear.\nNo, our clients database hasn't been compromised.\nNo, there was no impact on other clients than these 3.<p>We are deeply sorry for the three customers that have been impacted, and invite them to contact our commercial team (in french).<p>Regards\nOctave",1367338028

The maximum brightness is also significantly lower than that of iPhone 5's, which matters a lot to me. There are also other serious issues, like Dynamic Brightness Reduction based on APL.<p>I personally used a Galaxy S4 and immediately noticed another very serious issue with the display. You can check out this thread on XDA forums[2] if you are curious. In summary, green subpixels have lower refresh rate, which causes gray (RGB 50,50,50) lines to temporarily turn into purple (RGB 50,0,50) while scrolling. This is unacceptable for a such an expensive and high end device. And this isn't the only issue.<p>There are things I like about Touchwiz. I perfectly understand if you find it better than stock Android, which isn't perfect either.

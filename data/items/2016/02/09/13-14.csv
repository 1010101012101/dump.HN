Bought a used one that it roughly 20 years old ^^<p>I plan to replace the temperature sensor + controller with some 1 wire ones and use a raspberry pie to control the heater.<p>Some time ago I build a underwater speaker but the first experimental design is kind of quiet. It is unbelievable how expansive commercial once are. They are in fact just a speaker which use the plastic housing as membrane. Maybe I should print a housing.<p>As a addition I added a oxygen compressor to boost the oxygen level inside the tank. It is much more comfortable as the quite high humidity inside the tank is not that pleasant.<p>If you build a tank from scratch, I would say ~1500 € in material, depends how much you want to hunt for heap parts.<p>Nice things not many know:<p>you can sleep quite good in the tank. It&#x27;s different form of sleep, but very relaxing. You drift more between the sleep world (DMT) and awake world (Serotonin). Very lucid dreams, sometimes multiple a day.<p>No, you don&#x27;t rotate as those are reactions to pressures which you simply don&#x27;t have. If you turn, you will awake. Usually those tanks are filled with bittersalt, which is very, very bitter and burns like hell ^^<p>I rotated once, because I had a very lucid dream about drowning and panicked after waking up. Funny thing, it was then when I actually rotated and drank a good sip of water ^^<p>You should not overdo it, as it may affect your ability to sleep in a normal bed.<p>If you spend longer time in the tank >9h-12h, depends on the person, you get hallucinations from sensor deprivation. A very interesting way to observe internal states without altering them first. But of course, it&#x27;s only nice if you know that you can open the door anytime you want. Once you spend some time in it, you understand why this can be abused for torture as well :(",1455026338

11065244,comment,11059447,11065089,0,0,bitwize,,,"No. Lambdas are a language notation representing a computation with parameterized inputs. A closure is a lower level <i>data structure</i> in the language implementation, which a lambda may or may not compile into. A closure consists of a chunk of code (whether s-expressions to be interpreted, vm bytecode, or native object code) together with a record that provides the locations of the code chunk&#x27;s free variables in the surrounding environment. (In Scheme, variables bind to locations, not values.) If a lambda has no free variables, then the chunk of code itself suffices to represent it, and this code may be inlined, optimized away, jumped into instead of &quot;called&quot; when it appears in tail position, etc.<p>One of the things that makes lambda so powerful is that it does not force a particular implementation on the language implementer, and allows for plenty of room for optimization.",1455026264

I have problems feeling guilty about self-care, so I need that excuse to put myself first for a bit.<p>I went into my first experience expecting some sort of hallucinatory, transcendental experience. I did some meditation, but it felt forced. So I relaxed. That went almost too well. When I jostled back to full awareness, that&#x27;s when things got interesting.<p>Normally when I back-float in water, I&#x27;m aware of its 2D surface. I need to stay on the surface. Above is impossible, below is bad. In the tank, I could relax because the salinity kept me afloat. I was able to think and move in three dimensions.<p>The tank became this empty space of three dimensional &quot;white&quot; board, albeit pitch black and a little confined so I couldn&#x27;t go too crazy. But I was able to think out loud without looking weird. I could thrash my arms around as I visualized things against a blank canvas.

When the iPhone came out, the public statements made it clear that they didn&#x27;t seriously expect the no-plugin policy to last or that it&#x27;d drive users away – and it certainly never looked like anyone took the ton of problems experienced by Android users seriously enough to take the product out of maintenance mode.<p>It took years of them being derided as the leading source of browser crashes and exploits before they even started to offer automatic updates in 2012! – and naturally they rolled their own so it didn&#x27;t work reliably for years.<p>Similarly, performance was obviously not a priority until it started being heavily mentioned as a reason to prefer the HTML5 stack, at which point they were hopelessly behind and unwilling to invest enough to catch up.<p>I mentioned my poor support experience because that also fits with the general pattern. The bugs I reported were mostly in the runtime, although the IDE definitely had problems (stability, unreliable debugger, etc.), and all of this was well-known in the community along with the belief that the only way to get attention was if you worked somewhere large enough to buy millions of dollars worth of licenses.<p>All of that is consistent with my theory that the product management was focused on the short-term and loathe to spend money on anything which wasn&#x27;t critical, which left them in the unenviable cycle of reacting late to threats from a year or two ago rather than leading anything. If they&#x27;d invested in quality during the early 2000s the last decade might have gone very differently.",1455026169

During this time, Rome enjoys a golden age under five virtuous emperors, then begins to disintegrate under the reign of various tyrants and opportunists.<p>AD 250-260: Rome is falling apart under various civil wars and there&#x27;s two major state-led persecutions (by Decian and Valerian) of Christians. (The motivation being &quot;rid the Empire of this impious cult which is weakening our social fabric&quot;).<p>AD 260-300: The &quot;long peace of the Church&quot;, where Christianity is officially tolerated.<p>AD 300-310: Diocletian comes to power and starts a brutal series of persecutions to wipe out Christianity for good. It&#x27;s from the Diocletian persecution that most of the images of brutal Roman suppression come from.<p>AD 310-325: Various civil wars, leading Constantine to come to power.<p>AD 325: Constantine establishes Christianity as the state religion.<p>So though there&#x27;s one small persecution in 64, then two medium-sized persecutions in the 250s, then a massive persecution in the 300s, between these Christianity is either ignored or tolerated by the Roman state. There&#x27;s evidence of mobs of Roman citizens attacking Christians independently of any state backing, but aside from that, Christians were largely left alone for a 200 year period.<p>This is the age of the 5 &quot;enlightened&quot; emperors - Trajan&#x27;s attitude is informative. The Romans saw Christians as impious atheists (for not worshipping the Roman gods) and superstitious cultists (for following a novel religion), and they were troubled by the growth of this sect; Trajan took it for granted that Christians who refused to worship the Roman gods should be punished. But, he also states that actively seeking out Christians would be &quot;out of keeping with the spirit of our age&quot;- a weird Roman kind of tolerance, but there you go.<p>&quot;You observed proper procedure, my dear Pliny, in sifting the cases of those who had been denounced to you as Christians. For it is not possible to lay down any general rule to serve as a kind of fixed standard. They are not to be sought out; if they are denounced and proved guilty, they are to be punished, with this reservation, that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it--that is, by worshiping our gods--even though he was under suspicion in the past, shall obtain pardon through repentance. But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age.&quot;<p>(Trajan&#x27;s letter to Pliny here: <a href=""http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/pliny.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/pliny.html</a>)",1455025704

11065044,comment,11063713,11063713,0,0,IsaacL,,,"I only have a fuzzy idea of what they&#x27;re talking about here, but Terence Tao had an interesting reply:<p>&quot;This paradox is actually very similar to Banach-Tarski, but involves a violation of additivity of probability rather than additivity of volume.<p>Consider the case of a finite number N of prisoners, with each hat being assigned independently at random. Your intuition in this case is correct: each prisoner has only a 50% chance of going free. If we sum this probability over all the prisoners and use Fubini’s theorem, we conclude that the expected number of prisoners that go free is N/2. So we cannot pull off a trick of the sort described above.<p>If we have an infinite number of prisoners, with the hats assigned randomly (thus, we are working on the Bernoulli space {\Bbb Z}_2^{\Bbb N}), and one uses the strategy coming from the axiom of choice, then the event E_j that the j^th prisoner does not go free is not measurable, but formally has probability 1/2 in the sense that E_j and its translate E_j + e_j partition {\Bbb Z}_2^{\Bbb N} where e_j is the j^th basis element, or in more prosaic language, if the j^th prisoner’s hat gets switched, this flips whether the prisoner gets to go free or not. The “paradox” is the fact that while the E_j all seem to have probability 1/2, each element of the event space lies in only finitely many of the E_j. This can be seen to violate Fubini’s theorem – if the E_j are all measurable. Of course, the E_j are not measurable, and so one’s intuition on probability should not be trusted here.<p>There is a way to rephrase the paradox in which the axiom of choice is eliminated, and the difficulty is then shifted to the construction of product measure. Suppose the warden can only assign a finite number of black hats, but is otherwise unconstrained. The warden therefore picks a configuration “uniformly at random” among all the configurations with finitely many black hats (I’ll come back to this later). Then, one can again argue that each prisoner has only a 50% chance of guessing his or her own hat correctly, even if the prisoner gets to see all other hats, since both remaining configurations are possible and thus “equally likely”. But, of course, if everybody guesses white, then all but finitely many go free. Here, the difficulty is that the group \lim_{n \to \infty} {\Bbb Z}_2^n is not compact and so does not support a normalised Haar measure. (The problem here is similar to the two envelopes problem, which is again caused by a lack of a normalised Haar measure.)&quot;<p>I found thinking about the two envelopes problem he mentions (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem</a>) a more accessible way to wrap one&#x27;s head around the paradoxes that arise when you compare a (potential) infinite quantity to a (known) finite quantity.<p>(The crux of the envelope paradox is that each envelope has an infinite expected value, but in reality only contains a finite amount. I can sorta-kinda see how the infinite hats problem is another example of the same paradox).",1455024147

11065025,comment,11056711,11064181,0,0,tzs,,,"> Why does everything for girls have to be pink?<p>That&#x27;s fairly recent. It wasn&#x27;t until the early 20th century that blue and pink started being promoted as gender identifiers--and it was pink for boys, blue for girls. It stayed pink for boys, blue for girls until the 1940s, and then the pink for girls, blue for boys convention took hold.<p>From the &#x27;60s through the mid-80&#x27;s the trend was toward gender-neutral clothing for kids, due to the rise of feminism. The style of feminism at this time had a strong anti-femminine bent.<p>The next generation of feminists took a more accepting approach to femininity, accepting that a woman could be the equal of a man and still also want to be feminine. Marketers picked up on this, and started pushing the blue means boy/masculine and pink means girl/feminine because having different categories leads to more sales (if a family has children of both sexes, they need to buy two sets of baby things instead of just passing the first baby&#x27;s hand-me-downs on to the second baby). Hence, the spread of blue for boys, pink for girls beyond clothing to things like cribs, strollers, room paint, and so on.<p>Here is a nice article on this history of this: <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-did-girls-start-wearing-pink-1370097/?no-ist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-did-girls-st...</a><p>> I feel like, if we got rid of all these false associations, the difference between genders would be minimal, and that would make the sorts of problems discussed in the article a lot more manageable<p>There would probably still be some significant differences. Nearly every other mammal has significant sex-based [1] behavior differences, including primates. It would be astounding if humans did not. There is research that indicates that very young children do have built-in preferences for certain kinds of toys and that these preferences are different for boys and girls, and there is research that finds these same preferences in some non-human primates.<p>For instance, studies in two different monkey species found that girl baby monkeys preferred to play with dolls more than with trucks, and boy baby monkeys preferred the trucks over the dolls. See <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/22677-girls-dolls-boys-toy-trucks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescience.com/22677-girls-dolls-boys-toy-trucks...</a><p>Researchers looking into these preferences in human babies have found that they correlate with sex hormone levels. Boys with higher testosterone levels tend to have stronger preferences for &quot;boy&quot; toys. Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (a condition that causes them to experience high levels of androgen in the womb) preferred &quot;boy&quot; toys, lending more credence to the theory that hormones are involved. (See previous link for more on this).<p>[1] I&#x27;m saying &quot;sex-based&quot; here rather than &quot;gender-based&quot; because when talking about more than just humans we need to stick to things we can externally observe. Since sex correlates very highly with gender in humans, this substitution works for most humans.",1455023790

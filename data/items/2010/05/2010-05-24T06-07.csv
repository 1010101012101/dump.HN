1373926,comment,1373648,1373864,0,0,tpz,,,"Within the Framework's Base Class Libraries themselves, the documentation is pretty good about stating what is and is not thread-safe and the implementations are generally quite good in that regard. Outside of the Base Class Libraries there is a lot of variability in thread safety, of course, so YMMV depending on what you're working with.<p>That said, the thread safety isn't as critical in something like Node, at least not in the sense you'd usually be worried about, as the execution model is explicitly single-threaded. What you'd be more interested in finding (and pushing to improve) would be libraries that are externally bound but fail to provide an async option using the recommended async patterns for .NET. To be clear, these recommended async patterns and a good number of their proper implementations do not require hidden threads for their async behaviour, as when built correctly they are layered upon lower-level async operations that themselves do not require threads.<p>One would hope to work towards a ""turtles all the way down"" kind of scenario where eventually nothing you are using blocks on anything external and instead uses the async primitives and layers them up such that no threads are needed for any async operations. Admittedly, as .NET goes there would be areas you can't achieve that goal, however, as some framework bits are secretly backed by threads (e.g. some serial port handling, when last I checked), but this is also true in the case of Node.js which itself maintains threads behind the scenes for use with otherwise-unavoidable blocking code. In either Node-style case the end goal is the same: to minimize if not eliminate the need for such threads, and in the .NET-specific case it should be largely achievable (to the degree that it matters) as there are plenty of building blocks with proper async options.",1274681561

These have little functionality, and are mostly toys or are basically sophisticated marketing materials. An example of this type of app: <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/digital/e3i2e2fd2bc31136679bc3101796b8b9235"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/digital/e3i2e2...</a> [Coca-Cola]<p>Should you make this type of app? If you already have name recognition, or your industry functions off of it, YES. This type of application can basically be something that people toss away, but just like much of advertising, may make your customers take notice and remember you.<p>If your industry does NOT function off name recognition, I don't really see why this type of application is useful for you to make. They often disappoint people who want hardcore integration with your products and services, so they aren't without cost (not even costing development cost).<p>Now should you create a client/tie-in app for your business? It depends. If you work off of some sort of information that the iPhone can collect (even ""Where is the user""), then really look at a strong case for developing an app. Functions the application can access are: Where is the user, what's a picture of something the user is near, how fast is the user moving, what is the user's email, what is the user's contacts, what are the user's phone numbers, shall the user call you right now, and would the user like to hear something right now. Odd pieces to consider separately, but depending on your industry, they may be appropriate. If you're a paint company, pictures of their room which you then make an app to show their walls (or even have real people doing mockups for them) could be a good selling tool. If you're a home improvement company, pictures of the job could be a great thing (see the excellent ""JuJu List app"" for an example of this) for making a good quote. If you're a company that needs to show a local area to users (say, here are our locations, or here is our delivery zone), then the app can do well for you. But remember, if people think your app COULD do something, they may go away disappointed if it doesn't.<p>For instance, if your company repairs heating and A/C, if the app doesn't show them the status of their call, and estimated time of the driver, you'll very possibly get negative reviews, bad press, etc (then again, bad press can be better than no press).<p>Additionally, iPhone apps are not inherently expensive. You can get them done for under 10k, but you <i>have to listen what's cheap, what's not, and be willing to cancel what's not</i>. Lots of medium to large size companies involve way too many people and expensive measures, and end up spending 40-200k internally and 20-150k externally before they get their app out the door due to overmanagement. Ideally, this sort of thing should be a 1-3 person job lightly managed at a company.",1274681488

There was a panel on mapping at SxSW 2009 with representatives from OpenStreetMap and Google Maps and the OSM presentations were much, much more impressive thanks to this kind of feature. I'm not surprised Google felt the need to catch up.<p>If you want complete control over your maps, check out Tile Drawer - <a href=""http://tiledrawer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiledrawer.com/</a> - it lets you define your own map styles using a Cascadenik stylesheet, then run your own EC2 instance that will render and serve custom tiles for a specific area using those custom styles (and OpenStreetMap data).",1274681422

For one thing, you know it would be interesting. For another, it would be a great way of teaching by example. But more importantly, it would introduce the vital sense of self-regulation through shame. Who could look at a ""fluffless"" profile and not blush, knowing that his own profile is full of expressed preference for lolcats and corporate gossip?<p>I know I would toggle this option for my own profile.

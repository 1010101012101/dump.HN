Most socialists in Western Europe (e.g. the UK Labour Party) were more afraid of the Soviets than those on the political right.",1368611938
5711012,comment,5704485,5705783,1,0,vidarh,,,"""Isolated, limited movement"" is a horrible way to exercise.<p>My flexibility, coordination and posture has all improved substantially through lifting - I <i>needed</i> a lot of work to get flexible enough to carry out e.g. deep squats and correct deadlifts without hurting myself.<p>Do primarily isolation exercises, and yes, you will not spend time maintaining and improving your flexibility and coordination. Do exercises with large range of motion and complex movements, like deep squats, clean and jerk or power clean (power cleans are ""easy"" compared to clean and jerk), or kettlebell exercises, and add in some dynamic stretches for mobility (<i>separate</i> by time from the lifting), and most people will get far more flexible and coordinated.<p>Personally I'm annoyed at people worrying about getting bulky for two reasons: Yes, it is annoying seeing beginners be all presumptuous about how easy it'll be, but I also find well trained but non-bulky women more attractive. And I happen to know that most of them will never, ever get into bulky territory without a combination of cutting their body fat to unhealthy levels and steroid use, so I would love more women to lift weights..",1368611927

5711000,comment,5704485,5705261,1,0,vidarh,,,"And it's worth pointing out a couple of other things most people don't realize:<p>Almost all of the people you see pictures off with really huge muscles today are/were heavy steroid users. Arnie looks ""normal"" compared to modern bodybuilders, and he used lots of steroids <i>and</i> put in massive amount of effort (another thing a lot of non-lifters don't understand is that steroid users don't get it easy, what they get is much faster and better recovery, letting them work <i>harder</i> and keep improving beyond a point where non-steroid users plateau) year after year after year. He first won a competition in <i>1965</i> after many years of exercise, and got his last Mr Olympia's in <i>1975</i> and <i>1980</i>. The entire competitive field moved massively in that period with<p>Even more so, you usually see pictures of them that are nothing at all like what they normally look like. When training for Conan, Arnold decided to take one last shot at Mr. Olympia, and went on to <i>win</i> the 1980. Here's what he looked like:
<a href=""http://www.ironmanmagazine.com/blog/johnhansen/2011/12/27/the-1980-mr-olympia-controversy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ironmanmagazine.com/blog/johnhansen/2011/12/27/th...</a><p>But he looked like this, minutes to hours at a time at most, while covered in oil and dark colouring to bring out his definition. This is Arnold near or at his peak, after months of gruelling competition preparation, followed by making sure he is hydrated just right and his muscles are pumped for competition.<p>Outside of competition or exercise situations most lifters will be much less lean (especially power lifters) and will ironically often look smaller as a result of less definition and for many a less V-shaped torso that masks some of the development. I even find myself impressed by guys at the gym that I know for a fact are less muscular than me when they happen to be leaner so their build is more noticeable.<p>I just did heavy (for me) bench sets this morning. When I do, my chest and arms swell enough that my normally well fitting t-shifts stretch noticeably. I have to keep adjusting my polo shirts. This lasts for a couple of hours, and the swelling wears off.<p>I'm roughly Arnie's height, and weigh as much as he did at his peak. My body <i>volume</i> is bigger than he was at his peak, but I look much smaller because I have about 15kg more fat than him and 15kg or so less muscle... (I can claim my volume is bigger because muscle is more dense than fat - his overall volume would have been smaller, but concentrated in more muscle on his arms, chest and legs rather than as more evenly spread fat; I believe his waist was 34"" when he was competing; I'm 36"" to 38"").<p>This is after 8 years of ""recreational"" lifting, starting at 30. I'm consistently in the gym 3-5 times <i>every week</i> outside of perhaps 2-3 weeks a year. If I started younger, and lifted more seriously, I might have gotten closer in size, but without steroids and far more work I'd have no chance of getting close to that kind of muscle volume and development. I'm not even at competitive levels for regional competitions in either power lifting or body building.<p>Yet I look more muscular than most guys who worry about getting bulky ever will, but I look tiny compared to well developed body builders much smaller than Arnold, despite a similar body <i>volume</i>.<p>Another thing most people that worry about this don't realize is that they eat way too little to ever get to even my size no matter how much they exercise. Currently I'm gaining strength at a good rate without increasing my weight thanks to mostly following intermittent fasting with a very high protein diet. Most days I eat 180g-230g of protein... Most people will find they'll be so stuffed they can hardly push more food down if they try that, pretty much irrespective of total calorie intake - getting most of it via lean chicken to give me some flexibility for other meals, still means I have nearly a kilo of chicken for lunch... I'm sick of chicken...<p>And I am <i>not</i> eating enough to get steroid-eating body-builder big, by far - I currently eat at roughly maintenance levels but varying up and down to get me in a slight deficit on non-exercise days and slightly above on exercise days.",1368611572

5710996,comment,5709552,5710671,2,0,Xylakant,,,"You're exaggerating. Malaria is a killer, but it's not tens of millions of children per year. The WHO estimates a number just shy of a million, about 50% children. That's still a sizable number and in principle you're right - most of them are in poor countries.<p>However, the mechanisms that drive this are more complex. A grossly simplified version goes like this: Since the population that's hit worst has no buying power, no pharmaceutical company is interested in developing a vaccine or an effective, cheap treatment. Malaria is very much a poor peoples illness due to a variety of contributing factors: No access to effective treatment, no access to mosquito nets, no proper hygienic conditions, no enclosed living spaces that keep mosquitos out.<p>Just spraying DDT on every swamp in Africa is not a solution to the problem. DDT accumulates in the food chain, mostly in fat and gets fed to the children you're trying to protect via the mothers milk. It is linked to an increased rate of stillborn and cancer. It's really not the kind of stuff you'd want to use if there's any alternative.",1368611429

5710992,comment,5704485,5705544,1,0,vidarh,,,"If they ""struggle with the same (low) weight for ages"" they are not following either SS or SL, as both programs include protocols for deloading to get past sticking points that works, and to eventually changing programs once your progress slows too much. E.g. SL goes from 5x5 to 3x5 to 1x5, to switching off SL entirely and switching to Madcow or Texas Method or similar - this progression is explicitly documented as part of the program, up to and including <i>stopping</i> SL.<p>SL is by design a beginners routine, intended to exploit quick recovery while you're a beginner. It is <i>intended</i> to get too hard for you to continue to be able to gain on it. Starting your workout with 5x5 squats 3 times a weak is not something normal people will keep doing with heavy weights. Once I started flattening out with SL 5x5, it took <6 months of substantial gains before I was flattening out on 1x5 too, and switched first to Texas Method, then to Wendlers 5/3/1. At the moment I'm doing a program that is similar to 5/3/1 but slightly higher volume, as I'm seeing decent results from that while eating like a pig.",1368611347

You're trying to hire people with experience and significant skills - for which they're probably already being paid really well. Why would they quit their current projects and come work for you?<p>Honestly, a lot of start-ups just seem to want to hire incredible valuable people and offer almost nothing in return for that value. Everyone wants experience - most commonly because they don't know enough about the project themselves to design a test that will distinguish those who know what they're doing from those who don't (which is hardly inspiring to begin with.) Why would anyone want a high-commitment, high-risk lifestyle without the probability of commensurably high returns though? You talk about high equity but equity in a failed project's not worth diddly.<p>It's like... will you go work for this iffy guy in his shed for a couple of years on the basis of this product he's pinky-promised is awesome?<p>You need to offer people something they can't get elsewhere if you want to hire them. And all you're offering is the chance to interact with customers and the chance to 'shape' the product. Which is just... marketing jargon. You can't trust that to mean anything.<p>I suspect you'd be best off designing a test so that you can hire people with less experience, or just hiring one of the free lancers and accepting the uncertainty that they're going to stick around (trade on a risk for risk basis, essentially.)",1368610996

a) always check response rate and average response time to weed out any sloppy profiles;
b) BEFORE you place a reservation, write a host introducing yourself and telling a bit about the purpose of your visit;
c) after the host OKs you (or makes a special offer through the system), go ahead an make the booking.<p>Of course, the optimal time to book is 1-2 weeks before you arrive, do it earlier and hosts' plans might change, do it later and they might simply miss your message.",1368610735

The limitation being that your service can redirect go get to a different repository url, but go will still fetch that repository and check out what it thinks is the best branch for that version of go: one with the name of the current go version, or master. So you'd have to play some tricks to keep a full clone-able repo with master locked at some commit for each version of each library, rather than just one repo per library with tags. I guess there are some ways to do that where the clones share the objects so you aren't wasting space, though so not insurmountable.",1368610434

It's easy to show that there exists u such that u^2=-1 (mod p).  Indeed, simply using (2k)! works.<p>Consider all number of the form a+b.u (mod p) where a and b are in the range 0 <= a,b < sqrt(p).  There are more than p of these, so by the pigeon-hole principle we have a0, b0, a1, b1 such that a0+b0.u = a1+b1.u (mod p).<p>Rearrange to give a0-a1 = (b1-b0).u (mod p) and square both sides.  Remembering that u^2=-1 (mod p) we get<p>(a0-a1)^2 + (b1-b0)^2 = 0 (mod p)<p>A little checking shows that (a0-a1)^2 + (b1-b0)^2 < 2p, so that means<p>(a0-a1)^2 + (b1-b0)^2 = p<p>Thus we have shown that p is the sum of two squares.<p>I can reproduce this proof at will.  I see how the proof works, I am convinced it's correct and valid.  I still don't really understand <i>why</i> every prime of the form 4k+1 is the sum of two squares, especially since every argument someone tries to give to show somehow it's inevitable also works for 4k+3, where it's not true.",1368609991

I have breaking news for you: the ""extraordinarily expensive reserve capacity to wage warfare"" is here because it serves USA's interests, and no one else. I highly doubt that the military policies of your government are conceived with the interests of us Europeans in mind (although there is overlap between ours and yours). I'm pretty sure that, except for a few mistakes, it has been immensely economically profitable for the USA overall, allowing you to influence or overthrow governments, ensure a hand on strategic resources as well as allow you to export your goods and culture pretty much everywhere through strategic alliances (I'm thinking especially about Japan and South Korea). That's the reason why there are USA bases in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and everywhere else.<p>By the way, as a whole Europe is the 2nd military spender, with France and UK matching Russia's spendings, and when added together also matching China's spendings (despite having less than 200 times the population).",1368609835

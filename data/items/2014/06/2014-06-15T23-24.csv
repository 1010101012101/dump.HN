You actually don&#x27;t know what the goal was, but with a statement like this you can manufacture one that hasn&#x27;t been met.<p>I think the 5C <i>is</i> part of a <i>strategy</i> that will ultimately allow Apple to address a larger market, but the <i>goal</i> of the 5C was not to cause that to occur immediately, but rather to conservatively introduce a second iPhone <i>without</i> destabilizing the whole product line.<p>If you consider the number of elements needed to make that happen: new design, new manufacturing, carrier agreements, marketing, etc, the goal here was to establish this second apparatus in a controlled manner.  This is why the 5c internals are essentially the same as the 5 - i.e. the engineering element of the strategy is unchanged from before.<p>The 5c is the beginning point of the strategy, not the end.<p>The only people who think that the 5c was a disappointment, are those who think slashing prices is a &#x27;strategy&#x27;.",1402876673

It&#x27;s probably more common now simply because there are more take-out possibilities, e.g. take-out from Starbucks.  There seems to be less stigma now.<p>The article paints a little bit of a rosy picture regarding people and their trash.  I do often take home my trash so that it can be properly disposed of (the city picks up different kinds of trash on different days, for proper disposal or recycling), but I do this somewhat reluctantly.  Who wants to carry around trash?  And sometimes, if I&#x27;m lazy, I put the trash into the outside trash bins of whatever convenience store happens to be nearby.  In fact, I think the now ubiquitous presence of convenience stores goes a long way to explain why there are very few public trash cans.<p>While most people here do not litter, there is a small percentage who do, either regularly or because they&#x27;re drunk and have lost their sense of social responsibility.  But there&#x27;s always a group of volunteers (often senior citizens) who clean things up every morning.  Also, the well-heeled routes are often in front of stores or restaurants, and it&#x27;s not surprising that someone will be cleaning up in front.<p>But overall, there is very little littering.",1402876616

7896745,comment,7896175,7896175,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"Some very interesting analysis, and in some ways, it raises even more interesting questions about the sampling at IMDB. Who is filling out IMDB reviews and ratings? How many segments are there among the raters, and to what extent are they truly representative of the general, TV-watching population?<p>Looking at the list, for instance, you see that Dragon Ball Z shows up as one of the highest-rated shows of its decade. Now, perhaps a truly randomized, representative sample of the population really would rank Dragon Ball Z as one of the greatest TV series ever made. But my gut tells me that&#x27;s unlikely. More likely is that a big cluster of fans of the show have self-selected into rating it highly. What you&#x27;re actually seeing, in this case, is the power of a very vocal, very rabid niche. [1]<p>This same effect, in reverse, can artificially deflate the ratings of shows and movies that a vocal minority of the population rallies against. This appears to be the case with Gunday, one of the lowest-rated movies on the site, which David Goldenberg of FiveThirtyEight discusses in a very interesting post: <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-story-behind-the-worst-movie-on-imdb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-story-behind-the-wor...</a><p>Finally, we need to filter the data set for size. Ice TV, a show from 1996 with all of 6 ratings on its IMDB page, probably wouldn&#x27;t pass our gut check for &quot;Best of the 90s,&quot; alongside shows like The Sopranos and Friends, which probably got ratings more or less representative of public opinion.<p>This is a fascinating subject and a really compelling start. But the next step in this sort of analysis is developing a reasonable methodology for parsing and reconciling quality, quantity, and clusters. To give the author due credit, he expresses the appropriate amount of skepticism or reservation when showing results. And his observations about genre and overall trends are fascinating to see.<p>[1] Of course, this raises some intriguing questions about what, exactly, a &quot;quality&quot; show is. A show that has a large, thriving fanbase is a great show to that fanbase. And to the extent it&#x27;s attracted a sizable, rabid following, it can probably be said to be a great show in general -- even if it&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. And that&#x27;s probably fine. Obviously not every show is going to appeal to everyone in the population. Nevertheless, strong-niche shows confound our idea of &quot;generally&quot; great shows and make normative comparisons very hard to do, unless we start factoring for things like strength of sentiment.",1402875896

The whole idea of having a single source tree is unnecessarily limiting - everybody works in their own branches, pushes to a origin/github remote, and when their work is gtg for the trunk, they, in their branch do a git pull --rebase, or alternately do a `git fetch; git rebase origin/master`.  If they haven&#x27;t touched any files that other people have touched, it just moves their branch point off of the current tip of origin/master, and they can merge their changes into master and push.<p>The only time it should be hard to push code is if both people made changes to the same file, and realistically, the same lines of a file.

Their hypothesis is that American society (actually, Anglo-American) experiences crises about every 80-90 years (Armada, Glorious Revolution, American Revolution, Civil War, World War II). The First Turning is the post-crisis high (for the past 500 years, we&#x27;ve emerged successfully from each, although that&#x27;s not guaranteed to continue. The Second is the peak, the Third Turning is a cynical, chaotic unraveling period, and the Fourth is the crisis. (For the past 100 years, most of the world has been on the Anglo-American cycle.)<p>In the recent First Turning (1945-65) we saw broad-based improvements for all social classes, and progress on civil rights. In the Second (1965-85) Turning, technological progress continued but the working class was thrown under the bus, while the middle class continued to do well. The Third Turning (1985-2007) saw the middle class get hit as well, but the upper-middle-class did OK. In the first half of the Fourth Turning (2008-) the upper-middle class (&quot;the 9 percent&quot;) is getting smashed and, later on, it will start to affect the upper class.<p>It seems to be a pattern whereby the rot travels up the social ladder. The disintegration is finally recognized as a problem only when it starts taking out the elite (as it did, last, in 1929). It&#x27;s not clear what our &quot;crisis&quot; looks like or even whether we&#x27;re in one, but I think that will be more clear in a few years.<p>In this light, none of this news surprises me.",1402875559

Or alternatively, comparing objc and C++ (especially C++ as practiced in the 1990s, not the RAII or template patterns that emerged later).<p>Say you&#x27;re looking at the landscape as it existed a while back, and you&#x27;ve decided to make language changes to C in order to add objects.  On the one hand you have C++ as it existed then: a language that can&#x27;t seem to figure itself out, that has a very complex syntax and lots of troubling situations you can walk into.<p>Then along comes objc.  In contrast to C++, the language delta from C is tiny and easy to keep in your head.  Especially before Apple started doing all this compiler-fu of recent years, it felt like just a few keywords bolted on, and most of the important additions seemed to be in the runtime library.<p>When I first saw objc it kind of clicked for me as the anti-C++, in a way that is truer to C and doesn&#x27;t add a lot of complexity.  At the time that seemed refreshing, though I think I see more good in C++ now that RAII and templates are more of a thing.

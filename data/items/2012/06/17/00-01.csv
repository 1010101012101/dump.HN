There are very good hackers who would make open source drivers if they had specs. Arguably less buggy drivers.

Submit a GitHub issue [1] if it doesn't work; I'll take a look as soon as I can. You can also clone the repo and use that as your reference implementation.

But walk into your bank, apply to your local retailer or call the plumber and you'll be writing on paper. The general estimate is that we are at 1% adoption today.

They were frustrated that so much ceremony and effort was going into so little success, in failed project after failed project, across the software industry.\nThey had each enjoyed amazing successes in their own right, and realised their approaches were more similar than different, so they met to agree on a common set of principles. Which we promptly abandoned. The problem is that Agile calls for us to embrace uncertainty, and we are desperately uncomfortable with uncertainty. So much so that we will replace it with anything, even things we know dont work. We really do prefer the Devil we know.\nOver the last year or so Dan has been studying and talking about patterns of effective software delivery. In this talk he explains why Embracing Uncertainty is the most fundamental effectiveness pattern of all, and offers advice to help make uncertainty less scary. He is pretty sure he wont succeed.",1339891242

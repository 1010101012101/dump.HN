In my first job, I&#x27;d automated pretty much all of my work. Where others would do stuff by hand, I researched how to write a script to do it for me. At some point, I had a collection of scrips and macros that generated most of my code straight out of the functional design.<p>So whenever the boss popped in, he saw me leaning back looking at my scripts doing all my work for me. I was usually the first one to be finished with a new task. I reduced compile time from many hours down to 30 minutes (which all the other programmers were extremely happy with).

One specific criticism was that &quot;For some of the interns, it was difficult to get them to stop working and go home.

My mentor was especially impressed, but he was the only one because nobody else saw how much code I was writing or its quality. They would just see me getting up to pace about when the problem was very difficult, or opening up hn when I needed to give my brain a break.<p>Long story short, my manager said that they weren&#x27;t going to hire me full time, which came as a shock because I thought that producing quality code to the deadline was the important part. He cited early mistakes in writing documentation (I&#x27;d never written a functional spec before the internship, but I posit what I eventually produced was of the highest quality) and my perceived lack of motivation.

There were lots of articles published about Haskell and software transactional memory.  The demise of C and C++, and their managed Java/C# spawn was imminent.  How could you write in a language that couldn&#x27;t handle multiple cores for you?<p>The future is here, in 1/4 of the time I thought it would take.

In 20 years, cheap hardware will be\n ridiculously fast, but it will still look very much like\n Intel hardware today. We&#x27;ll have many, many CPU cores to\n work with, but nobody will use a parallel programming\n language designed to take advantage of multiple cores.\n Instead, virtualization (i.e. VMware, Xen) will be\n integrated into the operating system, and each process\n will run on its own virtual machine.\n\n  Each web browser will have been expanded into a full blown\n widget toolkit and have merged in something that looks\n like Flash, but there will still be multiple incompatible\n browsers. The latest craze will be a browser compatibility\n layer written in a programming language that compiles\n to &quot;raw Javascript&quot;, and it will reduce the performance of\n applications but allow you to use them anywhere.\n\n  People will set about re-writing a version of Photoshop in\n the new compatibility layer, and everyone will wonder why\n they&#x27;d do that, when the current version of Photoshop runs\n in Internet Explorer just fine.\n</code></pre>\nEdit: The lesson here is that if you want to predict the future, try to do it by making a prediction so ridiculous it could only be a joke.",1386872383

However, it is possible that the environment could change in the future in a way that makes it easier.<p>Right now there are a few things making it extremely difficult to make money with online poker. The obvious one is the illegality of playing from the U.S. What isn&#x27;t so obvious, is that the lack of casual American players has all but destroyed the global online poker industry. Back in the golden age of online poker, there were millions of recreational players who were really horrible, but kept playing as a form of entertainment. As the US Government started intimidating banks into refusing to handle poker-related transactions, a large percentage of these bad players (AKA fish) stopped playing. A few years later, when Pokerstars and Full Tilt were shut down by the feds, all but the most dedicated players left, leaving a relatively small pool of players that tend to be pretty good.<p>So now that there is a smaller group with a generally higher level of skill playing online poker, it is almost impossible to make a living.<p>At least three things would have to happen to make poker a good way to make a living in the future:<p>1. It has to become legal in the United States<p>2. It has to overcome its reputation for being unsafe (millions of people had their pokerstars and full tilt accounts seized.)<p>3. Poker has to become extremely popular like it was during the golden era of online poker.<p>If you are interested in poker, and you can play legally from where you live, I suggest learning the game now. If and when these things happen, you don&#x27;t want to be one of the fish.<p>Please note that playing facebook poker won&#x27;t teach you anything. People play much differently when there isn&#x27;t any money involved.",1386871469

I&#x27;d probably wait for Flynn to mature and look at that before investing much more time in Dokku.<p>Of note for anyone reading:\n1. Since the buildpacks are based on Heroku, if you&#x27;re having trouble try seeing what it&#x27;d take to get your app deployed there. For example with Rails 3.2, if you pre-compile your assets on the production server while deploying an app it will try to instantiate your app and test a database connection; however, Dokku doesn&#x27;t provide the database configuration until after this step of the deployment so your deploy will fail. This is fixed by either pre-compiling locally or changing a setting in application.rb. In Rails 4 I believe you just have to precompile your assets and check them along with the manifest into your repo. (Ref: <a href=\"https://github.com/progrium/dokku/issues/165\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/progrium/dokku/issues/165</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/progrium/dokku/issues/202\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/progrium/dokku/issues/202</a>)<p>2.

At the same time, paying someone in KLOCs is probably a guarantee that you&#x27;ll have a bad time.<p>This is an issue I struggle with on a regular basis, as we outsource a lot of our development work.  We work on a project basis, but work very closely with our partners to help them make good estimates, maximize capacity, and minimize their (and thus our) risk.  I don&#x27;t want people to work overtime, nor do I want them under-committing.<p>My experience is that watching someone&#x27;s commits, even from far away, is actually a <i>damn good indicator</i> as to how capacity is being managed on a project.  Every project is different, but <i>coders code</i>: if they&#x27;re not committing frequently and regularly, it&#x27;s time to check in.<p>Human beings normally don&#x27;t have flat productivity, so activity spikes are normal.  But low activity in a period means there is not enough work and/or there will be a large spike later, which for me means risk.",1386871386

6895912,comment,6895606,6895606,2,0,swedegeek,,,"Yea, it&#x27;s hard to not think this is ultimately not a great move. It seems rather shortsighted from a Gmail user&#x27;s perspective if Google can&#x27;t address concerns over spammers being able to verify email addresses, or even just analytic trackers. It is also vastly less appealing to hear that Google plans to cache all images, which we know Big Brother is grabbing as well. And in the case where someone may want to actually see images for a marketing email (albeit, extremely rare for me), it actually hamstrings the source of the email from possibly providing customized images/content based on geolocation/browser/etc. that I could be interested in seeing.<p>So, what&#x27;s the upside vs. just having the option to display images as desired and NOT have Google cache them?",1386871365

You&#x27;re focusing the weight of each hand on a pressure point which is sure to contribute to pinching the median nerve.<p>Also, separating the left and right hand boards from one another really helps with joint stress.  I saw one of the designs has a axle.  Why not just split the keyboard in two completely?  I vote for each half of the keyboard having a velcro strap that I can comfortably attach just above each of my knees. For most people, this would be a very neutral posture.  In fact, it may even inspire better posture as folks would reach for the keys on their knees.. You know.. You could call it KneeKeyboard or Keys-4-Knees.  Then again, I&#x27;m sure someone has already done it, but I&#x27;m too lazy/busy to look into it right now.<p>Other than those comments.  Awesome stuff.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d like to add that the wrist pad suggests to me wrist movement is required to reach all of the keys. Again, the carpal tunnel gnome tells me that pivoting my wrist is painful. Why not strive for very little wrist movement.  Once you get there, the surface is it&#x27;s own support, and it would support more than just the wrist; it would support the forearm, too (see knee keyboard suggestion above).<p>I also noticed one of the designs recessed the keys below the face of the keyboard.  I think that&#x27;s a good way to get away from the vertical wrist pivoting.  Still, you&#x27;d need to mind the lip of the recess, so it&#x27;s not a high impact point on the wrist.",1386871294

We do need to care about things beyond ourselves but who wants to endure the institutional barrage of worthless or semi-worthless reports that can impose upon us throughout a given day if we allow it in this age of instant and ubiquitous communication? I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say &quot;please turn it all off&quot; because then you do lose the ability to get a minimum exposure each day as needed to stay meaningfully informed as a person and as a citizen but I would say &quot;give me one <i>giant</i> filter&quot; to be able to control and limit the flow. Who can realistically profit from a daily surfeit of junk-bond-quality reporting and especially about things such as a sensational car wreck (or whatever) having little or no affect on our lives? Since that is what &quot;news&quot; mostly is these days, it is best to apply that one great filter available to us all - that is, personal self-control. That is what I love most about your comment: it reminds us clearly that it is within our power to use such self-control and to thereby focus on quality while filtering what is junk.<p>The article itself is somewhat dubious, as you note.

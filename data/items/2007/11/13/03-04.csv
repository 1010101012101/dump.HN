You will discover this eventually.<p>Sure, it might seem important if trying to impress an <i>employer</i> right out of school, but that's still like waiting to be rewarded by Daddy -- much like the Christian religion, in which Celestial Dad is going to punish or reward you after you're <i>dead</i> -- there is no self-determination, only supplication.  Everything depends on <i>pleasing</i>, or obeying, some other more powerful entity.<p>Take off the shackles and decide for yourself.  Grades make zero difference for start-ups -- it's like Captain Jack Sparrow said, ""The only rules that really matter are these: what a man can do, and what a man can't do.""\n",1194925977

Point of the story?  Do a startup while in Uni.  It is the best place to find co-founders!  Plus you have very minimal costs (especially staying with your folks!)",1194925946

Business Administration. I dopped out after one year because I was getting a divorce. I had a 4.0 average.<p>\nI felt awful about lacking a college degree -- until managing my first PhD. He was an idiot. The second and third were worse. Really smart guys with an awful attitude.<p>\nEver since then -- I keep asking myself what the point would be to go back? College was fun. I learned to play games by arbitrary rules some jerk set up. I would much rather learn all the time than play games.",1194925380

Then my start-up took off and it was lots of fun. Funnily my grades improved a great deal between freshman year and sophomore year(even with the start-up).<p>That's how far I got before taking off. Hopefully I won't have to return anytime soon.",1194924522
78998,comment,78933,78985,0,0,rms,,,"What I meant was that even with college, many people utterly fail at life because there aren't as many opportunities as there used to be. I'm sure that if you are evaluating programmers the average programmer with a CS degree will be better than the self-taught person.<p>I know that not having a degree hurts me severely in a traditional job pool. I don't care. If I need to submit my resume to get a job, I will have failed miserably. I think I would choose street life over working for the man. I probably couldn't get a real job anyways, because I don't have very many skills or qualifications. Despite my lack of skills, qualifications, and especially motivation, I am confident that I have the instinct necessary to manage successful and obscenely profitable companies.",1194924513
78997,comment,78933,78977,0,0,jey,,,"I don't see work as pain, school is pain. So far I have had the luxury of picking and choosing jobs so that I only take the interesting ones. Granted, maybe tomorrow everyone without a degree will be ignored regardless of what their actual qualifications are, but I'll take that chance.<p>I don't want to work for someone who places such an importance on having a degree anyway. I want to work for someone who hires me for my ability to do work, so I think demonstrating that ability to do work is more important than getting some piece of paper.<p>A Bachelor's degree is just a certificate of minimal competence anyway. A significant fraction of people with BS CS degrees can't even write simple programs. There's plenty of other ways to demonstrate minimal competence than to get an undergrad degree.<p>So, anyway -- why's it so important to have a degree? Everything they teach (and much more!) is available in the form of dead trees at my local library. I can party with my friends regardless of whether I'm in college or not, plus now I can afford awesome beer. What else is left?",1194924343

Sure, you can start a startup at very very young age, but there are lots of other usueful things you can learn in college.<p>I had the chance to get some good art clases (which were fun, and a good way to meet girls), minoring in physics, math,  doing some finance/accounting.<p>I did things that I wouldn't normally do, i.e was forced to go beoynd my level of comfort, which is a good thing, as it forces you to learn new thigngs and it broadens your horizons.<p>Whoever says that college is a waste probably didn't know how to take full advantage of it.  (in academics, fun, creating life lasting connections, and learning from interacting with so many people of your age).<p>\nIn the ""Real World"" you just don't face the huge amount of interactions in such a confined space, with some many people of your own age.

Once you go for Masters/Ph. then the school where you go matters a lot more.<p>\nFor some wierd reason, the people that I met that didn't go to college but went straight working  (usually during 98-2000 boom), even thou are very smart, and did well  are somewhat rough on the edges.

The difference in quality of work between those with degrees and those without is significant. It is even possible to distinguish those with some college over those without any.<p>Like any generality, there are specific counter-examples, but the people that will need to judge you quickly by little pieces of information are very likely to skip over you. That is unless you have some amazing thing on your resume.<p>I did ok in undergrad (3.4), but I'm finding that as I tackle a masters full-time will working full-time I am rocking...

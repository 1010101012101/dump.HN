1570274,comment,1569807,1570251,0,0,giu,,,"Yep, definitely. Generally speaking, the book has a very good structure; everything has its place, and the book makes a very good job in guiding you from the very basics to the more complicated constructs. Moreover, all the constructs are explained very well thanks to the fact that they use quite a lot of code examples to back up explanations in the book, which help you understand everything much better.<p>What I personally (as a novice) have to mention is, that RWH surely is a very good book, but nonetheless you'll start reading some paragraphs or chapters over and over again, especially if you come from the imperative programming branch. Haskell is definitely not <i>easy</i> for a beginner, so prepare yourself to put quite a lot of effort in learning the language and functional programming in general, it's definitely worth it! :)",1280814864

1570211,comment,1568881,1570125,0,0,sr3d,,,"Hi Exline,<p>I always wanted to have a number between $10 and $15 so that it's more like a casual price that won't make people cringe to fork out their money.  In my survey (<a href=""http://marrily.com/survey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marrily.com/survey</a>), $10 - $15 is also the range that people are willing to pay as well.<p>A few response said they want to a price in the $5 - $10 rang, however, this price is too low, and in my opinion, it would affect user's perception of the application.  They would think ""you get what you pay for"".  Having a low $7.99 or $6.99 will probably hurt the app more than helping with cheaper price/higher volume.  Based on my own experience (I was a paid customer to 37Signals basecamp for the longest time), at the end of the day, the difference between $7.99 and $12.79 isn't that much.  I was willing to pay 37Signals $12 as much as I would if they priced it at $5.00.  However, it's a huge difference in terms of revenue (a 37.5% loss in potential revenue).<p>I read somewhere that prices that end in 9, .99, and .79 work best.  The  Appstore probably an amazing demonstration of this: 99c apps do sell, and so do $9.99 apps for the iPad.  However, I want to go with a price that works and not as as common.  So I pick .79.  And I'm superstitious as well, 13 is a bad number, so I don't want $13.79 (furthermore, (1+3+7+9) mod 10 = 0, not sure if it's good or bad here).  $14.79 is a bit high (I probably have to do A/B split tests once the site got more tractions to test this price point though), while $11.79 is a bit on the low side.  $12.79 is the perfect number.<p>However, all these come from a guy who has never sold anything in his life.  So don't count on my words.  I'm still in the experimenting phase, but I'd love to share my results afterward.<p>Cheers!<p>Edit:  For 13.79, the sum of all the numbers mod 10 is 0, in baccarat, that's the worst hand you can possibly have.  So definitely not $13.79 for the price.",1280812759

You can't do these sorts of things at scale, which a lot of people are still learning the hard way.<p>Part of an app server like Django et al being flexible is giving you the ability to shoot yourself in the foot. It is much harder to screw something up royally when you are working within the CouchApp constraints. That's what I meant by fragile.<p>Google App Engine gets this mostly right by enforcing draconian timeout limits and other constraints, so it is much harder to write an app that is gonna fall over under a big wave of traffic, as the sandbox will complain right away.<p>CouchApp is even more picky. The programming model doesn't have operations that could block on remote IO, so you can't even go down the bad path. Of course, when you do need to send an email, you've got to rethink how to do it.

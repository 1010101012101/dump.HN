I enjoy this b/c it makes backups extremely easy.<p>Negatives are:<p>It may not be as fast as Git, but the difference is barely noticeable.<p>Pulling an initial repo from the master is slow when there are tens of thousands of commits in the tree.  After the initial pull, sync's between repos are quick.<p>Diffs in MS Windows takes substantially longer than in linux.<p>Monotone may not be a perfect choice for the linux kernel, but its a great DVS that's easy to use, stable and lets linux/mac/windows guys work together.",1218232552

271037,comment,270839,270839,0,0,mdasen,,,"Basically, non-compete agreements allow corporations to become complacent and lazy.  They don't have to worry about their competition getting their employees and the knowledge they hold so they don't have to be as vigilant about improving their product.  It also means that employers don't have to compensate their employees (monetary or otherwise) as nicely since the employees don't have another option.<p>On the flip side, it breeds an environment where employees do just the minimum to get by because they aren't likely to be rewarded by their own firm and proof of good work won't help them get another job because of the non-compete.",1218230907

But I don't think you should just tell them a number.""<p>It's very useful to have a number in mind, and it's very helpful for an investor to know what that number is.  If I only have $50k to invest and you're trying to raise $10M then talking to you is probably wasting both of our time.  (The reverse is true too.  If I'm running a $100M fund and you only need $25k to get to your next milestone it's not a good match no matter how promising your company is.)<p>It's helpful to think of the question as, ""How much money can you make effective use of at the moment"" or ""How much do you want to raise before you stop putting immediate effort into raising money"" or ""How much do you need to get you to your next significant milestone (and what is that milestone)?""",1218230782

Everyone probably emails all VCs at the same time, so why not speed up the process?<p>Can have Entrepreneurs sign up, upload their business plan/youtube presentation. Then VCs will be able to login using a special verified VC account(that way Entrepreneurs will know that only VCs will see their presentations). And then be able to see the uploaded presentations and contact entrepreneurs for an in person interview.<p>Throw in a bunch of filter options for each party. A few web2.0 mashups for maps/scribd pdfs etc and bam instant millions.<p>To make money can charge either Entrepreneurs by telling them you are charging them in order to filter out the weak startups: ""If you don't believe in your idea to pay $___ in promoting it to investors, what makes you think its good enough for investors to put in real money?""  Or you can charge the VCs($____ to see each business plan or a monthly payment) or make it a non-profit organization and have a bunch of VCs donate to it.",1218230311

I'm pretty certain that I'm not the only HN reader with this particular issue.<p>Imagine (I'm not saying that I actually HAVE any of these things, but imagine!) that I have a product, a beta with a community of active users, and a good team of co-founders who are developing the product on nights and weekends.  Say I've even got some guesses about a marketing strategy and a revenue stream.  Overall, a good collection of stuff to present to a potential investor of ""seed"" capital.<p>The only problem is, I have a day job.  And (for now) I need a day job to eat.<p>If dealing with investors is really a full-time job as this article suggests, and should only be done in a startup city, as other PG articles suggest, how do I POSSIBLY afford to hunt down and meet with potential investors without starving to death?  I suspect that ""Can we meet after I get off work?"" isn't a great confidence boost for a potential investor.",1218229709

Professional stereotypes are set by the multitudes in the middle, not the highest-performing outliers.<p>Further, atypical behavior can be both a cause and effect of excellence. Being 'different' helps them be 'better', but also by being 'better' they gain freedom and confidence to deviate from norms.<p>(Of course, ""the worst X tend to be not very X-like"" is also true. But they're more likely to at least try to emulate the average X.)",1218229336

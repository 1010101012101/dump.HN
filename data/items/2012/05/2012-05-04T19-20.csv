3930073,comment,3928245,3928245,1,0,wtvanhest,,,"I would love for there to be a way to help prisoners not commit future crimes but this seems like a huge stretch.<p>First, most prisoners are not drug kingpins, they are people that do drugs to the point of not being able to control their lives, or people who commit violent crimes for nonsensical reasons or people who steal large or small sums of money.  Many are people you would literally be scared to see in public.<p>Second, entrepreneurial prisoners like drug dealers are dealing drugs because they do not view risk the same way normal people do.  They are in prison because they decided to take an illegal path toward making money knowing that it was easier than working.<p>Third, VCs will have a tough time explaining to their LPs about how they finance criminals.  Even worse would be a VCs risk if they finance one and the business fails and they have to explain it to their LP.<p>Forth, a really tough thing about starting a business is getting various people in the industry to work with you.  Being a past prisoner is likely to be a burden in those relationships.<p>Fifth, them getting state/national licenses that may be required to start various businesses will be very challenging.<p>There are exceptions, like there are with every rule, but this is a tough sell.  I could see a very small number of people being helped this way, but I genuinely feel like it would be tough.  There are so many great people working toward businesses with no criminal background, it seems strange to try to put the effort in to people that have made no effort for themselves.",1336161492

I'd argue that one's <i>human</i> rights don't ever get revoked, but that's just me.<p>What is the purpose of prison? I'd argue that it's a dual purpose: punishment and rehabilitation.<p>Being away from everyone you've ever loved or known is a <i>terrible</i> punishment. Once you walk out of a prison years after you went in the world will have changed out from under you. Your babies are grown and won't know you. Your parents might have died. Your friends' lives have moved on without you. The rhythms of daily life are now foreign to you. The particulars of any specific penitentiary system might make this easier (visitation, parole, etc.), but this is pretty horrible.<p>Why does someone commit a crime? Unless they are mentally unbalanced (which, in the US, is served by separate processes... e.g. pleading insanity), they have behaviors that are unacceptable outside of a set of social norms. Giving someone the opportunity to learn what society expects of them should be part of being in prison. Isn't education a great way to figure that out? Why should we be against someone trying to turn their life around after making some terrible choice? (Again, leaving aside questions of over-eager judicial systems e.g. the US' war on drugs)",1336161404
3930069,comment,3928345,3929154,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"<i>""There's no reason that DRM could allow the easy transfer of a book from one person or platform to another.""</i><p>You've inadvertently hit onto the core issue. DRM isn't about copy protection, it's ultimately about <i>power</i>. If DRM were only about publishers wanting to limit consumers to the same rights and capabilities that physical copies have it would have a much different form that it does today. Instead, DRM as it exists in reality is a tool to leverage even greater control over sales and wrest the very idea of ""ownership"" from buyers. It's no coincidence that almost all DRM schemes refuse to allow buyers to transfer their purchases to others.<p>All the talk about DRM is misleading, in reality it's just a power grab. Ultimately (much like software patents) we have to confront the way it exists in the actual world, not some hypothetical perfect ideal that has never been realized.<p>Today DRM is not a good thing, and for that reason we should strive to get rid of it.",1336161379

3930053,comment,3929766,3929766,2,0,dxbydt,,,"Amazingly bad article, riddled with inaccuracies. Is it because the stat/math has to be toned down so much becaudse otherwise the average Forbes reader can't grok the content ?
First he says, ""mean and standard deviation define a normal distribution"". They do no such thing. You don't even know what probability distribution attendance at sports events is when you compute mu and sigma. Then he says, ok its not normal, its power law. But the reason he attributes for power law is all wrong. Its not normal because there are no ""negative people"" to lower the mean ?! Ha ha ha!<p>His second example on the height weight regression line has little to do with whether there is a physical relationship between height and weight. If you really went to know, your weight might be a function of some two dozen variables like body surface area, bone structure/density, genetics, food-intake, income levels, nature of work ( sedentary vs active ) etc. Even if you gathered data on all those, 24 dimensions is a lot. So you do a principal components, and what does that do ? The first PC from the PCA gives you a conflated component that explains say 90% of your weight. That conflated component is going to be a linear weighted sum of many of the 24 dimensions. That conflated component is just a math object, doesn't exist in reality. If you want, I can easily connect your body weight to the attendance at your local sports event and a residual, and that regression might even be a good fit :)<p>In any case, none of this has anything to do with R, so his title is pure linkbait.",1336161185

I recall I was drawn to PHP at that time because it made it so easy to make a change to the code and see the change instantly. Not much else offered that, at that time (other than Perl). The world of the JVM seemed burdensome: you had to recompile to see a change.  Only Perl and PHP allowed almost live editing of your code, and instant refresh. It is interesting to think about how much tools have advanced, and especially tools in the JVM world. Some of the advantages that Perl and PHP seemed to have in 2000 are advantages that no longer exist.<p>One can argue that PHP is easier to learn than any language in the JVM ecosystem, but still, I think it is important to think about how much things have changed.

Fixed prices is a tradeoff that is needless nowadays. Try a better way.
 Spread the book far a wide on torrents everywhere. Make the Book also freely downloadable from
your site.
 This maximizes the number of readers.
 This maximizes the number of readers that wants more books.
 Tell them that that next book is planned, it will cost this much to write. Donate here.

I perhaps don't understand enough about the syntax to appreciate why those lower-level constructs would be beneficial w.r.t the geo stuff.<p>On the styling sure, data should often dictate the style in visualisations - the most noddy example people tend to give in JS as the exception to the rule of never 'programatically' (JS) setting styles is the <i>progress bar</i> where the width has to be data-based (as CSS-classes only make sense for discrete increments or 'states'). Of course the same applies for colouring/shading and sizing based on say population data or whatever is being modeled in a visualisation, I get that.<p>But, in the example on the first page the bars of the histogram are all explicitly coloured gray w/ white text programatically and the bar heights are manually set to '20' (presumably px). What would make more sense is for them to have a default class of say 'hist-bar-default', which is set in CSS to { height: 20px; background: gray; color: white }.

Thanks.<p>When someone goes to prison it's generally for a good reason, after the jury and trial and all that, it's safe to say then that these people forfeit their rights. That's what happens when you go against the rules of a society you belong to. I think everyone can agree with that. The trick is balance, sure it's not fair to blanket treat inmates all the same, however they cost us money to not just capitol-punishment the lot of them (a bad idea for moral reasons.) So they need to pay off their debt. But to go as far as to say they should be treated as if being away from everyone is their only punishment and that's already bad enough is a bit naive. Many people in prison did really bad things, like rape and murder, try telling the victims family in those cases that the inmate that killed their kid gets to get an education, a job, some savings for his release, cable TV, food, etc, etc. Tell them that and see what reaction you get.<p>To be completely fair they did bad things, we need to keep that in mind, also the cheap labor could be used to help society. Cheap furniture/clothing/household items, etc for low income families comes to mind.<p>I think the real solution is to be transparent about how much things cost, and we need to keep in mind that we can't allow for slave labor of prisoners just for those profits to go into CEO's pockets. If we are to do that then it needs to go to the potential rehabilitation of the inmate, and in dropping the costs so lower income people can save money on essentials that are made by inmates hands.<p>PS: This is definitely one of the most thought provoking articles relating to inmates I've read in a long time.",1336158567

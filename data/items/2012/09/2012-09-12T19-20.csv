At least I can take good pictures easily with it, you know just press the button no matter what you are doing. No? So this is just a CPU upgrade, wow!
Probably a solid device, a little outdated camera and charging etc, but the apple hype is getting annoying. Every new device is tried to be sold off as the biggest thing ever.<p>So what is better in the iphone5 than eg a lumia 920 except the ""ecosystem"" (appstore, millions of apps)?
The lumia is better at least in these:
- nfc
- wireless charging
- best camera phone after the 808
- great inbuilt free gps/navigation
- excellent exchange and MS documents integration (important for business users, not so much for startup kid-wonders of course)",1347478965

Hospitals and surgeons will not operate on you unless you are not expected to recover, or regain consciousness. Being brain-dead, it is also very unlikely that you feel pain. Reflexes can easily still be active even with brain-death, leading to convulsions during surgery. If the author had ever seen a serious car-accident victim in a coma, he wouldn't have second thoughts about organ donation. In his blog post, he is insinuating that you are still a normal, living, conscious human being. You aren't.<p>Having grown up in a family of medical doctors, I find this blog post appalling.<p>EDIT: As thebigshane pointed out, my wording is indeed terrible, I wrote my response in a hurry, and I will not edit it to avoid confusion. I do not have any professional medical education, all I know in this field is derived from in-depth conversations and discussions with my parents, whom are both medical doctors.

* Seemingly no fundamental improvement to Siri.  ""Conversational Searching"" is the best way for Apple to bring the fight to Google, because this is the natural evolution of search.  Why type queries into a search engine, when you can have a conversation with an AI instead?  Google sees this danger and is developing Google Now, leaping ahead quickly.

Raganwald has been very constructive in discussions about depression treatment here on HN. I try to do the same, and am always happy to upvote one of his stories or comments on the issue. One of my most disappointing memories of my early participation on Hacker News is hearing that Dan Haubert of Ticketstumbler (HN username ""fallentimes"") had died.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=859117"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=859117</a><p>Just shortly before that, there had been a thread here on Hacker News in which too many users were taking the point of view that people who seek effective medical treatment for depression are weak or fools, and that they should just man up and not talk to a doctor about how they are feeling. I'd hate to think that someone here pushed fallentimes to taking his life, by trash-talking the help that anyone feeling depressed can seek from professionals.<p>The paradox of mood disorders is that they are disorders of thinking, either being glum beyond the warrant of objective life facts (depression) or elated beyond warrant (mania). Prescribed medication is one means, and thoughtful cognitive therapy is another means, to help people who have mood disorders get back in touch with the reality of their lives and go on coping with the uncertainties of human life. The prescribed medicines usually work more effectively when combined with the cognitive therapy, and cognitive therapy, which is very helpful, often meets a person's needs better when the person is also taking prescribed medicine.<p>Because the human brain is enormously biochemically complicated, and because mood disorders are largely a disruption of a complicated regulatory system (""mood"" has many interconnections of cause and effect with other aspects of human behavior), it is currently hard to predict which medicines will be helpful for which patients. Sufferers of mood disorders do not all have the same genetically influenced biological substrate for their difficulties in mood regulation. So part of medical practice in dealing with depression is still quite empirical--prescribe a first-line medicine, and see if it works, and then try something else if the first medicine doesn't work or if it has debilitating side effects. Patients who have a history of both low and high mood states have to be particularly careful in choosing medicines, because some effective antidepressant medicines can prompt episodes of mania. (Some medicines are categorized as ""mood stabilizers"" and are helpful for the downs of depression and the ups of mania.) But doctors who have a strong clinical experience base can help patients a lot with advice on which medications to try first, and many patients benefit soon after starting medication by being much better able to gain from cognitive therapy and much better able to cope with life stresses.<p>By the way, repeated studies of life stress and its relationship to mood disorders show that generally people who suffer bad mood disorder symptoms are persons who have more stressful life events (family, employment, housing, or other major changes) than related persons who have don't fall victim to mood disorder symptoms. And the usual twin study methodology and other behavioral genetic studies show that mood disorders plainly have some genetic influence, although genome association studies have yet to show ANY particular gene with a strong effect on mood regulation. Simply put, mood disorders appear to be a polygenic, multifactorial disease with diverse underlying genetic vulnerabilities leading to greater risk from life stresses than some other people undergo. More research on the issue is still being done, but meanwhile seek competent current treatment, and don't give up.",1347476990

When betting on HTML5 you get the benefit of quick updates across multiple platforms and smaller team size. However, most of your time is allocated towards finding work arounds for strange browser bugs. Mostly glitches in the UI. With native, things work the right way most of the time, so you can quickly create exciting new features, which excites the team. The down side of native, is that you'll be implementing that exciting new features N number of times for each platform.<p>Now that I am doing a lean startup, the reality is that the first app will be re-written completely. My bet is to focus short-term on one platform and write using native code for speed and lack of bugs (higher moral).

4512436,comment,4511065,4511065,1,0,Pongo_the_Great,,,"This struck me as an interesting take, due to your analogy: (some) viruses[1] can be inoculated against. Looking at this through a 'real world' lens, rather than a mimetic one, suggests something stronger.<p>Your argument is that is, Facebook has an interest in providing inoculation against viruses to their users, while the viruses themselves (Zynga) have a vested interest in removing possible inoculating effects within their ecosystem. i.e. Facebook should provide inoculation against Zynga. Now, your argument revolves around the ""active/positive"" end of this, where you make an appeal to Facebook to reduce the most egregious examples of this[2], as it will increase user pleasure, enhance the ecosystem and provide you with healthy users. To be fair, this approach has produced some movement from Facebook on the more obvious ones (such as the early phone ads).<p>This is all well and good ~ however, you're ignoring the ""negative/passive"" way in which this is done.<p>Zynga actively creates an ecosystem that ensures that the most successful viruses (i.e. <b>your social game</b>) have to conform to the most successful strategies, precisely because it is so metric / psychologically driven. If you want to compete against a dominant virus, aping the same Skinner-driven models (<a href=""http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/11/28/1931246/more-on-why-it-stinks-to-work-at-zynga"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/11/28/1931246/more-on-why-...</a>) makes sense, both in market terms and ecological terms.<p>But you're aiming at the wrong target. Facebook isn't purely a host, it's also a virus. In fact, it benefits from a relationship where it isn't the ""worst"" virus,  as this makes it more attractive to users (i.e. changing security / functionality / sharing of user data being the more obvious examples), while the ecological impact Zynga provides allows it to act more aggressively as a virus (i.e. your user base becomes used to virus tactics). The relationship is mutalistic, as the market well knows.<p>Your real target needs to be inoculating the user, so that they either recognise the strategies of the viruses and produce anti-bodies against them (the ""Steam model"", where your user will only react favourably to positive behaviour by a virus, because they react violently against negative behaviour, forging a symbiotic relationship[3]) <i>or</i> by producing a product that is more suited to your environment. i.e. is better at virus intrusion than Zynga, either in camouflage (""we're-nice-but-secretly-screwing-you"") or by creating antibodies against other viruses (""I get such an empathetic bond with this virus, I'm not sure why, it just makes me feel good""). (The distinction is purely in the awareness / active interest of the user).<p>Wall of text: right gripe, wrong target. Facebook and Zynga both know their core market, and the real question is: why don't most users have such antibodies against viruses automatically?<p>Answer: probably due to culture & this being the first true generation of users experiencing such viruses. Of course, without being too cruel, there's some that will never produce antibodies, as we all know. <a href=""http://www.bogost.com/blog/cow_clicker_1.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bogost.com/blog/cow_clicker_1.shtml</a><p>[1] Never virii, never.

[3] In a purely user<>host example here, there's problems with Steam just as any other DRM / software provider
[4] This example broke down in the first instance by not treating Zynga as a producer of viruses, and multiple other problems due to me typing quickly and not wanting to turn this into ecology 101. I hope that it was at least a little bit interesting / useful.",1347476756

We only have to look towards a religious-economic theory called Dominionism.<p>Dominionists wish for religious (of their brand) education taught in schools. Not only that, they wish for the 'laws of the land' to represent what they see fit for laws.<p>Others have discussed the evils of fundamentalist Islam more eloquently than I.<p>The underlying idea is fundamentalists of all types wish to force their rules, edicts, and etiquette upon others whom do not wish it. Fundamentalists need to be stopped, especially in cases the individuals being forced do not have enough power to defend themselves.<p>An example: I am effectively a pagan. I have certain beliefs and practices. I do not want to force my beliefs on others, up to and including wearing a pentagram on the inside of my shirt. However, I meet people regularly who try to preach the 'word of christ'. Is your faith that weak that you have to sell it like a used car dealership or auctioneer?<p>Yet, politically, we have rules enshrined that say one cannot hold state offices if one does does not believe in the ""1 true god"". Or politically, rules that allow Christians in classrooms but not of other religions. One only needs search google for countless examples.<p>I don't want other religions to bother me. It's like philosophical spam.",1347476407

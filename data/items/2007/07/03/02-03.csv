This adds a new dimension to the game that is missing in the ESP Game.<p>So instead of combating cheating, why not encourage it explicitly by providing features to help players cheat?  For example, in this beautiful image game, one can show the results of past image pairs while the game is in progress.<p>Even in the presence of such cheating, one may still get lots of useful data for subjective problems.  In fact, one may get more as the games would have a new dimension to them.\n	",1183431231

32174,comment,32165,32165,0,0,cglee,,,"I was wondering when these super conservative groups, such as the Heritage Foundation, would start using the ""inequality is good"" argument.  There's a lot to like about an utopian society based solely on meritocracy.  But the truth is there are large numbers of people who cannot compete on equal footing due to circumstances that are/were out of their control.  It's like taking a Chinese class with a bunch of Chinese students and you're the only one who doesn't know the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese.    <p>Using the Google founders as the example of ""inequality being good"" is ridiculous.  Most people don't have a problem with rewarding innovative work; people have problems with not providing a baseline for those who can't.  In a pure pay for performance society, those who can't perform, won't get paid.  Is this fair?  On the surface, well yes, maybe.  But what if the REASON for their non-performance is based on systematic oppression and lingering effects thereof?  Is a pure pay for performance system still fair? <p>What about the handicapped, depressed, and otherwise ill affected?<p>The pay for performance (or inequality is good) argument is fine when no one gets hurt, when the low performers, say, will get a 1% instead of 10% bonus.  But when we're talking about the lower levels of society, where people can literally go homeless or die of untreated disease, then it's not so easy to come up with these fantasy theories.<p>\n",1183431061

It's a good deal if you use its features and probably a bad deal otherwise.<p>",1183429176

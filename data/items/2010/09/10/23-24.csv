It also has an intelligence trainer that allows you to explicitly hide and highlight stories that you like or dislike.<p>It imports directly from Google Reader. It's just a project, but if people like it well enough, I could be persuaded to add some more advanced features (metrics on your subscriptions, advanced AI, etc) for a monthly/yearly cost. I'm afraid to put a Paypal/Amazon Checkout button on there, because that means NewsBlur is held to a much more difficult/higher standard.<p>But anyways, please, offer feedback and let me know if you think this is a good alternative.

Fixed-bid contracts are no different in this regard.<p>That said, the industry as a whole is bad at estimating and controlling scope creep. The best of best practices (which we follow) and years of industry experience (which we have) don't always save you. We resolve this with our clients by noting that in the world of fixed bid contracts, unless the estimates are precisely correct, someone will come up short. In the world of hourly contracts, so long as initial estimates are in the ballpark, everyone gets good value. Our clients agree and come back time and again; we've been chosen over fixed bids on many occasions.<p>(Random aside: I imagine, but have no data to demonstrate, that in the world of fixed bid contracts there is effectively a normal distribution of ""who won"" vs ""who lost."" Outliers are probably dishonest or incompetent companies or consultants.)",1284162064

1680531,comment,1680067,1680067,0,0,tildeequals,,,"SHORT ANSWER:\nAuthorize.net and Paypal are the most popular gateways, and therefore have the most community support.  To find a processor, I would use <a href=""http://www.transfs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transfs.com/</a>.  We used TransFS last year and they helped us find an inexpensive processor.<p>LONG ANSWER:\nThe number of players you have to go through in order to process credit cards is pretty crazy.  Here's how I'd summarize the different people you might have to deal with.<p>1. There are credit card companies, like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.  You're affected by their fees and policies.  For example, we found out that Visa has been enforcing a policy where they don't allow the capture amount to be different from the auth amount, except for merchants that get tips like restaurants and salons.<p>2. There are credit card processors, also known as ISOs (for Visa) and MSPs (for Mastercard).  They are responsible for communicating your charges to Visa and Mastercard.  They're also responsible for figuring out how risky you are as a vendor.  If you charge $100, and the buyer claims that the $100 charge was fraudulent or unsatisfactory (also known as a chargeback), and then you go bankrupt and refuse to remit the $100, the credit card processor is stuck with the bill.<p>3. Credit card processors use gateways like Braintree and Authorize.net to interface with your software.  It's much easier for them to use a well-known API than writing their own API.<p>4. Merchant accounts are accounts where your money get stored immediately after the merchant charges the clients' cards.  For most small merchants, the way it works is that the credit card processor has a merchant account on the merchant's behalf, and the funds get deposited from the (credit card processor controlled) merchant account into the merchant's checking account 24 to 48 hrs after the transaction.  In other words, if you're just starting out, I don't think you need to worry about getting a separate merchant account from a bank.  However, if the merchant is big enough that the float on the funds during those 24 hours actually matters, he or she might get his own merchant account.<p>5. The process for applying to a credit card processor (2) is fairly complicated.  There are people who help you with this - you can call them agents.  These agents get paid by the credit card processors for bringing them business.<p>6. Finally, another tier has emerged recently to help agents attract business - we can call them agent referrers.  Agent referrers help you figure out credit card terms and will refer you to both independent agents (5) and credit card processors (2) like Paypal.  They endeavor to make the process transparent for you.<p>We found an agent (5) and a processor (2) through an agent referrer (6) and were quite happy with the process.  The referrer was www.transfs.com, and the agent turned out to be www.cocard.com.  Transfs.com was extremely clear about the fees we'd incur.  I'm not even remotely affiliated with either company except as a client.  Before that, we\ntried a couple different agents and we also tried contacting our bank to see if they could set us up with a merchant account, but both of those approaches were dead ends.<p>I hope that all helps.",1284161130

How many applications do you know that you can take in the version they were 5 years ago and run them on a modern distro? I've used Linux for over 10 years and I wouldn't bet 5 cents on being able to find any software from 5 years ago that would run unmodified on a modern installation.<p>How does Ruby or Python keep track of old versions of libraries?

1680486,comment,1679580,1679580,0,0,tdavis,,,"Awesome job guys! A couple notes, from somebody who's done the interactive seating maps stuff before...<p>First off, this is essentially a direct clone of Fansnap.com's UI; I'd be surprised if SeatGeek didn't get heat over it. And since Fansnap has taken something like 10 times the funding Seatgeak has, it's not a move I would have personally made. But it sure is ballsy!<p>Secondly, I created interactive seating maps for TicketStumbler in one day using image maps and JS instead of any fancy (read: quality) canvas/SVG stuff. Turns out that was good enough to get StubHub to ban us from their API without so much as a notice. The ticketing affiliate industry is as shady and predatory as they come; if your product is similar to or better than a ""partner"" site's, don't think blackmail is beyond them or even outside the norm. All of which is to say, in this industry it pays to spend as little time as possible on features that you may be forced to disable or dumb down. Today, TS' maps are either disabled entirely or reduced in utility, literally to avoid being as good as StubHub's.<p>Although, with StubHub quickly making themselves irrelevant in the affiliate space by reducing commissions to near-zero, maybe it won't be such a huge deal this time around. Their affiliate manager would contact us the <i>same day</i> we released something StubHub didn't like; no other site has been <i>quite</i> that bad.<p>All that being said, I <i>really</i> hope Seatgeek does well. It would be amazing to have one honest, successful startup in this space that isn't run by a suit factory.",1284159710

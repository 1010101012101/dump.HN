(the link to the article is broken but easy to find)<p>Another interesting question is to look at the relationship of atheism and belief. Actually science does not approach real atheism - it never exceeds agnosticism (one of Feynman's points).<p>Real atheism is very close to deep religious belief. Look at the great mystics - St John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila, Kabbalists - they reach a point of blackness, emptyness where there is nothing but a completely baseless faith to sustain them.<p>William Blake in the 4 Zoas discusses 'experience'.

The aim is to make something that can fly. But we, from our position as birds, don't accept flying as anything other than bird-like flying - with wings and feathers.<p>Leaving the analogy, I think the article is saying that humans generally don't accept anything as artificial intelligence unless it exactly mimics a human, or is indistinguishable from a human. Thus the attempts to work out exactly how the brain (or wing) works and to replicate it.<p>In reality, AI research has progressed considerably - visual recognition, autonomous navigation, question answering etc. But these are only 'gliding', and are only leading towards 'other flight-like phenomena' such as bat and insect flight. We don't accept them as parts of an artificial intelligence because we think (rightly or wrongly) that there is something more to intelligence than just a set of special algorithms and feed back loops.",1266380727

I had fooled around with computers, but I don't consider that I really learned how to program until CS 101.  Getting a job and learning what a big disgusting mess software can sometimes be was another big step.  Finishing projects I start on my own is a lot harder.<p>I started composing a longer response to this, but it's getting too long for a comment one thing from it.  Maybe I'll post it when it's done.  Here's a paragraph from it:<p><i>One thing I continue to learn is how bad I am at estimating.  I think the key to estimating how long a software project will take is not to lie to yourself.  It's easy to be overly optimistic about your ability to keep things on schedule by working extra hard or being extra smart (step 1, step 2, ... and then a stroke of genius happens... step 4: profit!!!).  Software complexity (and hence development time) grows non-linearly with feature set.  When you're thinking about squeezing in one more little waffer-thin feature, you have to trust your gut when the little exclamation point or question mark appears over your head.</i><p>Also, estimating (and re-estimating) takes time.

Would be so much simpler to pick the event, the locale and then see a list of options including whether they were already booked out.<p>With a database of restaurant phone numbers, the polling of data could be automated. Robo-dial a restaurant at a less-than-busy time with ""This is Service X. Are you doing anything special for Event Name? If the usual, press 1. If a special menu, press 2. If you never want us to pester you again, press 0."" Then receive and transcribe the eventual descriptions.<p>Could have an automated call handling capacity too. ""Are you booked out for Event Name?

Any criticism of scientific findings without evidence is useless. Of course, the critics know this, and know that criticism without evidence cannot be refuted.<p>If you think that there's some sort of conspiracy going on, which is more likely -- energy companies making billions of dollars, or scientists making millions of dollars -- to be spending their money more effectively to change people's minds in order preserve their future profits?<p>Let's say 9 out of 10 doctors told you that you've got an 80% chance of dying if you don't change your diet. Would you think that those 9 doctors are conspiring against you? Or would you change your diet? That's pretty much the situation we're in here. (Except that the 1 doctor who disagrees also does a lot of work for the snack food industry.)",1266379768

I'm fine with an industry putting a million tons of Carbon into the atmosphere as long as it pulls out 1.1 million tons through some mechanism.<p>The fact that Bill's entire presentation is based on a false premise, and that nobody in this thread other than me has called him on it, is disturbing.<p>Pretty slide presentation aside.",1266379764

1130817,comment,1130082,1130082,0,0,milfot,,,"The moral wording of their argument, the appeal to morality, comes simply from an understanding of risk management. Risk being directly proportional to both the probability <i>and</i> to the impact of the event. The higher the stakes the less you want to take the risk, even in a potentially low probability occurrence.<p>Most people wouldn't think twice about walking along a garden wall if it were only a foot above the ground. If it were on the edge of a thousand foot drop, only a daredevil would attempt it.<p>In this case however, we are talking about (and I apologise for the tired cliché) walking a tight-wire over a thousand foot drop. It is likely, and the consequences are most likely fatal.<p>In this sense, it is entirely reasonable for a person or a group, on the strength of their conviction, to use strong moral language to hopefully avert the untimely deaths of millions, and understandable to attribute immorality to those who would continue to participate in the activities which they believe would cause these deaths.<p>Is that language effective? Probably not.. but what else do you do to convince a population who absolutely do not want to be convinced.<p>And, sure there is no scientific consensus on the science. Never is.. never has been. There is, however, consensus on the risk management.",1266379523

But establishing that dichotomy is somewhat useful.<p>I find in coding that I need to be humble and 'doubting' in the scientific sense. But I also find that I need to have faith during e.g. long refactorings. I'm not even joking. It may seem trite to apply it directly to programming, but considering the difference of the world of 2010 and the world of 1956 -- it's nice to see some of his insights are quite relevant.<p>(The naive part in his understanding, imho, which anything written in the 50's would be a part of -- is that a lot of history, which wasn't exactly in the history books back then, has many examples of people screwing over other people in the name of 'religion'. So it's not all a box of roses this Christian 'ethics' that he's putting forth. Though I suppose he had to respect the YMCA audience where he spoke and the times were quite different then. I'm sure he himself, the son of Jewish immigrants, was quite aware of it. But there's a bit of the typical Feynman arrogance -- like his dismissal of the social sciences in some youtube video. Should've been a little more scientific. But, like always, he is somewhat original and sometimes connects the important dots that we overlook.)<p>haha, someone posted this just now in another forum.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk</a>",1266379464

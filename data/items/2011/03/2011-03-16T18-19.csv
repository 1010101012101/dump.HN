What I was trying to say was that, for Netflix whose sole business is delivering movies and tv shows to consumers, moving into TV production is not a stretch. For a company like amazon, who already does so many disparate things, to now add something so monolithic as TV production might stretch them in uncomfortable ways.

You don't have to be particularly socially enlightened or progressive to create a startup.

2333218,comment,2332788,2333025,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"""Could you explain to me how the hell fuel in Reactor 4 storage pond at Fukushima 1 went critical?""<p>I can. The term 'critical' is used to describe the point at which fission events are being caused by the neutrons emitted by other fission events. Also called a 'chain reaction.'<p>Reactor fuel emits neutrons (actually even 'depleted' fuel emits neutrons see half life). Unused (and spent) fuel is stored in storage ponds filled with water because water is an excellent neutron moderator. Thus any neutrons that are emitted by the natural decay, or by internal fission events of the material are absorbed in the water and converted into a (relatively) small amount of heat.<p>Air is a poor damper of neutrons, and in fact the chance of a neutron hitting an atom in a gas is greatly reduced.<p>When the water in a fuel storage pond is removed, the naturally occurring neutrons can reach other fuel that is stored in that pond. If they are sufficiently energetic they can cause atoms in the fuel they hit to fission.  If they do cause fission then heat is generated and another neutron (note: it maybe 2 I admit I've forgotten the exact reaction with U235) is emitted which might cause another fission event.<p>Criticality is controlled by moderating the probability that a neutron will create a fission reaction. If you want to store uranium you can do this by either spreading it far apart or by placing it in an environment that moderates neutron flux. Since the latter is as 'simple' as putting it in water, that is the usual option.<p>The caveat is that your spent fuel will continue to generate heat, if you don't remove that heat eventually the water will boil. If the water boils sufficiently to allow fuel to be exposed to air, the result can be that the fuel passes its criticality threshold. If you can't keep water cool then you can replace it with something that moderates and doesn't boil.",1300299764

The credit that with saving their lives. In other words, they approached the fallout exposure problem from a scientific standpoint, rather than an emotional one.

In reality, of course, it's quite impractical to move everything away from dam failure zones.<p>Either way, historical data is very valuable and in that light modern nuclear plants are pretty safe but I think potential damage should play some role in the determination of course…obviously, the best thing would be to go full-tilt renewables (with pretty much only hyperlocal failures) but the question is can we get there without additional nuclear power even if everyone fully invests in it? If nuclear didn't linger such a long time after the plants are decommissioned, the risk/reward of building new nuclear to tide us over the next 20-30 years would be a no-brainer.<p>I think it's an important discussion that I'm not quite sure can be had rationally – but even that's better than not having it at all.",1300299161

9674148,comment,9672370,9672370,0,0,spronkey,,,"This is a poor article on many levels. Even basic facts don&#x27;t check out.<p>Agile didn&#x27;t &quot;grow up in web consulting&quot;, and it wasn&#x27;t about dealing with finicky clients who couldn&#x27;t be &quot;managed&quot;. It came from enterprise both large and small, mostly not involved in web or consulting. In fact, it arguably started before <i>software development</i> did - see Kanban at Toyota.<p>Agile <i>software development methodologies</i> came from a real need to reduce the failure rate of software projects that was, even 10 years ago, closer to 50% than 0%. It attempted to provide ways to stop the <i>average</i> software project from running nearly 50% over budget. It waged war on the &quot;big design up front&quot; methodology handed to us by other engineering fields and acknowledged that in the real world, software development is often a wicked problem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem</a>) that cannot be solved until it is solved. It acknowledged that requirements change, and software takes such a long time to build, often by the time a large design is built it already doesn&#x27;t do what it needs to.<p>Almost all the statements the author makes are misleading, or misguided.<p>Violent transparency? It&#x27;s a good thing that helps software projects succeed.<p>Atomic little user stories? They embody the divide and conquer philosophy to break down the author&#x27;s ambiguous &quot;long-term projects&quot; into small chunks that can be understood, tested, and estimated. And delivered <i>quickly</i>.<p>Shared ownership? Promotes respect of the team, organisation, and customer. Helps get rid of bat-cave developers who can&#x27;t acknowledge genius other than their own. Helps diffuse any blame for failure.<p>Social organisation? Has little to do with agile methodologies and a lot to do with the enterprises that implement them. Some do it well, some don&#x27;t. Scrum doesn&#x27;t dictate that a product owner or Scrum Master is more important than the engineer. Contoso Shiny Widgets Inc. does that. Just like they dictate whether experience and skill are valuable in their teams, and whether they listen to their engineers about technical issues that cause the kind of technical debt that is hard to solve with &quot;good design&quot;.<p>Exit strategy? Short term? What? Use an agile process when it makes sense. Stop using it when it makes sense. Of course the process is designed to be there forever - they&#x27;re tools to be used by people trying to solve real problems. The nature of those problems changes over time.<p>Lack of R&D? Software development is prima facie the D. The R? It&#x27;s entirely possible to do that in iterations. Agile processes certainly don&#x27;t remove R&D - spikes are there almost exclusively for R, and they&#x27;re a first class citizen in the process unlike pre-agile. Perhaps the author refers to those &#x27;long-term&#x27; projects that more often than not end up nowhere?<p>Technical debt? The author doesn&#x27;t understand agile at all. Agile has two main tools to help manage technical debt - fast feedback loops, and encouraging development in small vertical slices. The best agile has even more - XP promotes TDD, not prematurely optimising, refactor mercilessly among other things. Basically universally accepted ways to improve the quality of software.<p>Crunch time? No! Agile promotes sustainable pace. To help avoid death marches. Heard of those? They&#x27;ve derailed careers for good.<p>I&#x27;m no big supporter of Scrum - it lacks the software design guidelines of e.g. XP, and it&#x27;s been abused by some companies for their own purposes (probably those the author has worked for). But it has some fundamentally good ideas, and since Agile methods have been around enterprises small and large have improved on many measurable metrics. It&#x27;s the best we currently have - come up with something better.",1433674764

9674133,comment,9672520,9674063,0,0,sktrdie,,,"I think UI really shines using the Web stack because it was built using async tools from the very beginning. UI development should be async from the get go. In other non-webby systems you do UI using async but you&#x27;re still using blocking tools (for example by using Java&#x27;s mixture of async for UI but blocking for other stuff). JavaScript on the other hand, and all of its libraries, are entirely async which makes it a pleasure to work with - it&#x27;s a much more natural environment to be doing UI in (single thread and everything is there to be used without multi-threading complicated stuff).<p>This is a big insight that JS and other webby-tools have given to the UI world, and I strongly believe something entirely async needs to exist for the desktop/mobile world as well - fortunately there is in the form of node.js/electron/nw.js.<p>Now in terms of how that&#x27;s handled behind the scenes, I don&#x27;t really care (use a nice VM, use a whatever mixture of whatever you want). Just give me a fully-async toolset to build my app in a single thread and I&#x27;m happy.",1433674414

The coverage (and the jury decisions) aren&#x27;t always in their favor because people are diverse.<p>Beyond your prejudices I think you&#x27;ll find that there are men who feel the way you describe, and men who are staunchly feminist, and a lot of men who realize women are diverse: heroes,  victims, productive workers, and yes, sometimes,  &quot;money-grubbing exploiters of worthy causes.&quot;",1433674394

9674121,comment,9669945,9672861,0,0,jules,,,"It gets very weird. Some models say that going outside of the observable bubble is the same as passing the event horizon of a black hole. When you are in a spaceship and you pass the event horizon of a black hole, nothing happens to you yet. The event horizon is not some kind of physical barrier; you can pass it without even noticing that you passed it, though of course when you are past it there is no turning back. From the outside perspective however, there is a problem because information is conserved. According to some theories that information will be radiated out. So from the outside perspective the spaceship has been completely destroyed and radiated out. From the inside perspective the spaceship is happily orbiting. Something similar may happen when a spaceship leaves our bubble. Of course these models may be wrong, but it shows that the question of whether the spaceship still exists is not very clear, and may depend on who you ask. So is it ethical or not? I&#x27;d say yes because from their perspective nothing happens, well, from their perspective we die and burn. Note that in QM it&#x27;s clearer: if you are the one that sees the dead cat, then for all practical purposes it&#x27;s truly irrelevant whether the one that sees the alive cat exists -- there is no information being radiated back or something else that indicates that that version exists or not. The predictions of MW and copenhagen are identical, whereas with black holes we could observe whether something is being radiated out or not, and we could drop ourselves into a black hole to see what happens.",1433674115

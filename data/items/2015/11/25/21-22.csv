How many people actually want to go back given a shot at PR ?<p>I do not think his father bribed a government official is a correct.

Let me say, for the record, I think diversity (race, creed, gender, color, tint or hue) is important. And bias on those things doesn&#x27;t belong on campus. But campus isn&#x27;t group therapy, either. It&#x27;s a place like no other where we&#x27;re supposed probe the universe and try to find the answers. Diversity in that context should be in the service of that mission, not in the service of <i>balancing faction</i> which is what the OP is all about. Balancing faction is a slippery slope, set it aside.",1448488796

In a classroom, you&#x27;re dealing with a classroom full of a limited number of people who need to be able to state and defend their ideas. It&#x27;s unlikely that someone in such a classroom will bring up whether the moon is made of the body of Vince Foster, but if they do, students should be able to make a reasonable decision on how to respond (in that case, it requires little response beyond polite derision).<p>Dismissing something as a red herring without even bringing it up in a classroom avoids a key responsibility of an educator: students need to be able to recognize red herrings and respond to them as such. Red herrings occur in the real world. The role of the educator is not to dictate accurate information, it&#x27;s to teach people how to critically process information.<p>The news, on the other hand, <i>does</i> have the responsibility to dictate accurate information. As such, the only opinions that matter are the opinions of experts, and those should be subservient to data. &quot;Fair and balanced&quot; doesn&#x27;t often matter because if there are really two sides to the issue, the &quot;information&quot; isn&#x27;t accurate enough to be presenting to an inexpert public anyway. Debates should happen between experts based on the data, without politicization, and news should report the results.",1448488705

The same holds true for my previous Dell laptop. These types of chargers are usually made from hard plastic, with a plastic cable. They don&#x27;t fray the same way macbook rubber-y chargers do. In fact, Dell&#x27;s chargers are designed specifically to be tightly wound around the charger and come with a nice rubber strap to hold it tight.<p>> Your implied accusation that &quot;design aesthetics&quot; have taken precedence over functionality and durability is unfounded<p>Perhaps, but it does seem so given all the anecdotal evidence in this thread.

The problem is that lots of different people &quot;know&quot; that lots of different things are &quot;right&quot;. In my life experience (read: I have no data on this), we don&#x27;t seem to have the problem that not enough people will &quot;speak up for what they know is right&quot; because they fear trouble, we instead have the problem that not enough people are willing to challenge themselves on what they &quot;know&quot; is &quot;right&quot;.<p>Sorry for all the scare quotes, but my point is that the entire idea that people can know that things are right, and then speak up for those things, is off-base. Certainly, it&#x27;s a good thing to have a sense for what you think is right, and to be able to speak up for those things, but it&#x27;s a much better and much harder thing to be open to being convinced that you are incorrect. That&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t see much of in our society, and what all schools, and universities in particular, should do a better of imparting to their students! Instead of teaching people to better manage their anxiety about speaking against perceived social norms, we would be better off improving peoples&#x27; skills of hearing things they disagree with, and of structuring their own arguments such that they don&#x27;t drown out that disagreement (for instance, the all too familiar tactic of yelling and/or ranting continuously).",1448488493

In the worst of those cases I worked with years ago, your only method available for changing the &quot;header&quot; (not HTML header, of course) involved copying/pasting HTML with manually-inlined style declarations into a text area on the partner&#x27;s website.<p>It&#x27;s probable that he or she was just simplifying things for you, and that you&#x27;re just unaware of the actual underlying complexities; although changing the color on the wordpress site&#x27;s navbar sounds pretty clearly trivial at first glance, the full spectrum of places to which that change would have to be manually copied might be extensive, undocumented, and tedious enough to alter that &quot;No, that&#x27;s impossible&quot; is the go-to answer instead of spending time explaining why something sounding so trivial might actually amount to many hours of effort.",1448487895

I wish there were more women who were in those discussions, but I don&#x27;t think the solution is &quot;just let them participate even if what they say is totally ignorant&quot;.<p>Frankly, most white boys are not skilled enough to participate in discussions about race and gender.

You&#x27;d have to reference the Kendo UI Core library and then the KW.js script before rendering your components containing e.g. <KW.DatePicker /> as in the readme.<p>Internally the Kendo library is going to maintain its own state and manipulate the DOM elements needed for each widget, and I only know a bit about how that works. Most of these wrappers only run render() once because React would throw all kinds of errors if it tried to diff the DOM inside the components.<p>Updates are handled in componentWillReceiveProps, and whenever the component can be updated with the new props without destroying and recreating itself, the updates happen via the Kendo API (after the wrapper checks if the new value is different). This means that for common use cases these wrappers should perform just about as well as the widgets do normally. Also every controllable setting is exposed as a prop, and the props are synchronized on every update. Props that are not passed in are reset to the defaults, meaning these widgets should <i>appear</i> stateless to the containing component.<p>The react-kendo project[0] uses some very cool introspection to provide full support for all the Kendo widgets, and it looks like it should be reliable and stateless. However it destroys and rebuilds the widget on every update.

Second, why are you (who may have been born there, thus giving you a presumptive right to keep living there) bound by previous agreements which may or may not have been legitimate to begin with.

So, a p-value test using a standard normal distribution is taking a shortcut that hides some of the calculations, making it appear that p-value is not actually counting a ratio, however, if you look at the full calculation from the axioms, p-value represents the ratio of agreeing observations to total observations.

They (wrongly, racistly) believed that the only way the &quot;African race&quot; could be saved from &quot;savagery&quot; was to be in captivity.<p>This argument is clearly stupid and wrong from a 21st century perspective.

After all, the abolitionist would be promoting &quot;clearly wrong&quot; morals.<p>The idea that a majority should &quot;come down hard&quot; on dissenting ideas is inherently a conservative (if not reactionary) move.  In the 1950s, a vast majority of the country (wrongly) thought that homosexuality was a toxic sin that could (stupidly) infect children who were exposed to it.  If you gave that majority the power to &quot;come down hard&quot; on dissenting views, the gay rights movement would never have happened.

In theory, the products should be recalled, the companies that import them fined, and their principals either fined, barred from directing a company, or criminally prosecuted. But does that ever happen? When laws are not enforced, law-breakers will be able to undercut you, and drive you from the market. Which is exactly what has happened here.",1448485575

Hippocrates actually first recoreded it, and Freud&#x27;s very first patient in 1880, Anna O., had it (she was partially blind/deaf and paralyzed) and she eventually recovered. Then it was known as hysteria, and today it&#x27;s categorized as a form of somatoform disorder. It used to be quite common, and may still be, although there is some controversy in this regard (1a).<p>There&#x27;s little that can be said about this particular case, because so few details are included - other than that it&#x27;s no surprise that it co-occurred with DID, for discrete mental illnesses rarely exist in the wild. They almost always come in bunches.<p>Predisposing factors for somataform include alexithymia and childhood trauma (1b) and it often co-occurs with anxiety and/or depression. Alexithymia (a little known condition involving a severe deficit in awareness of emotion and the body, and a focus on the external world) is usually a key factor in the etiology of the disease.<p>&quot;Individuals with alexithymia tend to demonstrate an impoverished fantasy life and limited imagination, a diminished capacity for empathy, a penchant for impulsive behavior, and a propensity to experience emotions somatically&quot; (2). The deficit in emotional processing is usually (at least originally) the result of a conscious effort to suppress/distract from unpleasant emotions (like this lady&#x27;s trauma), which then express themselves in the body. Indeed, alexithymia-like symptoms are a common feature in a number of common mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety and panic disorder (3), and the more alexithyia-like characteristics these patients have, the worse their somatic symptoms (4).<p>Treatment of the disease is difficult because despite its psychological etiology, patients usually present well and emphatically deny that their psychology has anything to do with their symptoms (5). Interestingly, emerging findings on it tend to revolve around some of Freud&#x27;s original ideas (6).<p>(1a) <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235919/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235919/</a><p>(1b) <a href=""http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2014/03/07/jnnp-2013-307203.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2014/03/07/jnnp-2013-30720...</a> and <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399913004352"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399913...</a><p>(2) <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/hrpjournal/Fulltext/2014/05000/Changes_in_Alexithymia_Following_Psychological.3.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.lww.com/hrpjournal/Fulltext/2014/05000/Chang...</a><p>(3) <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11126-012-9246-y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11126-012-9246-y</a> and <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810009000919"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810009...</a><p>(4) <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Schoevers/publication/268690042_Differential_Associations_of_Specific_Depressive_and_Anxiety_Disorders_with_Somatic_Symptoms/links/551bda3c0cf20d5fbde218ef.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Schoevers/public...</a> and <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X14002570"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X14...</a><p>(5) <a href=""http://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/do-patients-with-somatoform-disorders-present-with-illusory-mentalhealth-2161-0487-1000213.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/do-patients-with-soma...</a><p>(6) <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744921/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744921/</a> and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4396134/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4396134/</a> and <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976341500161X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763415...</a>",1448485490

But after questioning and debate, there must be a final disposition that lets us move on to other challenges. How we reached that disposition should be so clear that it invites renewed debate only in circumstances where new insights have been made.<p>I feel like we already use this pattern in a variety of settings. The legal system comes to mind, where we build this collective body of decisions that either prove useful and are built on, or modified and removed if not. But there is not a sense of anything being &quot;inappropriate&quot; to question. The very core of the legal system is challenged on a regular basis and we don&#x27;t feel the need to censor those who challenge it. We have a general level of confidence that the system has checks and balances that let justice prevail.<p>Two observations. One is that this reminds me of eventually consistent systems. The law lags slightly behind reality but we know it catches up eventually. Reality is always changing and so we don&#x27;t expect the law to always be up to the minute perfect. Perhaps we can embrace this notion of imperfection as a reason to keep discourse constantly open.<p>Second is that the law is effectively the source code for running society. It has procedures set up around it very similar to how we&#x27;d run a successful open source project. Integrators, reviewers, unit testers, engineers, project managers, pull requests …<p>Perhaps in the case of Yale and other institutions, what is needed is the same level of transparency we have in a well run source repo or legal system.<p>1) everything is written down somewhere, is properly attributed, and openly discussed.\n2) systems are in place to propose changes, understand the impact of those changes, and integrate or reject those changes.\n3) there is an understanding that this is an evolving system, it has a past, present, and a future.\n4) history is recorded so that present and future discussions can be made with the appropriate context in place.<p>I feel like this is the solution for incorporating dissenting views, converging on the set of beliefs that identify the underlying priorities and preferences of the participants, and making it clear why certain things are the way they are.<p>It is entirely possible that institutions may converge around policies that are abhorrent to some, but being clear and transparent about that at least makes people know what they&#x27;re getting in to. It&#x27;s possible that a system like this at Yale would result in some students or faculty deciding that their views would not be welcome there, which is better than discovering that after the fact.",1448485430

So, since the 3.14 is less than the p-value of 5%, the experimenter rejects the null hypothsis. MAYBE this is the difference, if any, between p-value and alpha, in which case we&#x27;re talking a triviality.<p>This is completely wrong: you&#x27;re confusing the alpha and the p-value. Maybe you meant that alpha (5% in your example) is the preset type I error rate (significance level) and the p-value (here 3.14%) is calculated from the data. But conceptually the alpha and the p-value are different things and shouldn&#x27;t be mixed. 3.14% is definitely not &quot;for the data and the test, [...] the probability of Type I error&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re doing hypothesis testing, you calculate 3.14 which is less than 5 (alpha) and you reject the null hypothesis. If the calculation had yielded 0.69 instead of 3.14 you would also reject the null hypothesis. But you cannot consider the second result to be &quot;stronger&quot; than the first one. They are both below the threshold and that&#x27;s all that matters.<p>If you&#x27;re using p-values as evidential measures, the second result is indeed &quot;stronger&quot; because 0.69<3.14.

Power = 1 - beta, it is not directly related to alpha. (Maybe it&#x27;s just a typing error, I&#x27;m not sure what is your point.

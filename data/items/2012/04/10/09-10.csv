3821469,comment,3820699,3820699,9,0,olavk,,,"Many both pro and con PHP articles are missing the point about PHP. PHP is a great success in spite of its obvious shortcomings because it supports <i>iterative development</i>. (Saying that language choice is less important for a project than other factors doesn't explain anything - all other things being equal, a language with fewer traps and idiosyncrasies would be the better choice.)<p>The killer feature of PHP is that you can FTP to the server and start adding arbitrary code to a static html file by adding a single tag. Other frameworks <i>deliberately</i> makes this more complicated with more overhead, because they want to promote a better architecture with separation of concerns and so on. Basically these frameworks have ""encoded"" the waterfall-method, because they assume you know from the start that you need a complex site. PHP supports iterative improvement from the simplest site (static HTML files on a server) to arbitrary complex code, without requiring major speedbumps where you have to rethink the whole app.<p>This also mirrors how many web developers have learnt to code - starts out with making html/css, then gradually learn php by inserting simple snippets of code to make banner rotate and so on. (The ""right way"" of course would be to take a pause for a few years to get a CS degree before adding the banner rotator.)<p>When an app grows beyond a certain level of complexity, changing to a better platform might improve quality, but then you have already made an investment in existing code.",1334051614

3821439,comment,3819902,3820018,1,0,dasil003,,,"I think there are two problems here, both of which could be chipped away at, but neither will be completely solved anytime soon.<p>First, you have the fact that users don't know enough to solve abstract problems with programming.  As programmers we have this deep base knowledge that we subconsciously draw upon.  It's impossible to create a platform that makes it trivially easy to ""test small game ideas"" without narrowing the scope to trivial game types.  People need a foundation to figure out how to put the pieces together.  Fortunately, a lot of this is just familiarity with computers, so every new generation gets better at this, making the problem more tractable over time.<p>The other, is that software is truly an organic ecosystem.  There is no designer that is coordinating the software world.  The closest we have are closed platforms like Apple provides (which is still limited in overall scope) or standards (which are defined in a deliberately narrow scope for modularity's sake).  So to make a single uniform environment that could do everything a casual programmer might want to do, and make it consistent, you'd have to write some kind of monolithic standard and convince a large minority of all software writers to support it in some fashion.  The UNIX philosophy and POSIX are attenots to do something like this, but as you alluded to, it's still highly non-trivial to get your footing underneath you.  To create an even higher-level standard seems almost impossibly difficult, but I suppose it's possible that progress could be made by focusing purely on a new high-level language and GUI.  I'm not holding my breath though.",1334050404

I'm sure you won't believe it, but right now there's a cap for Internet access speed in Iran (128 Kbps: 128 Kilobits per second, or 16 KiloBytes per second). If you're a student or you can make a <i>reasonable</i> argument, you can go as high as 1 MBps (and an unmetered 1Mbps access costs about 130 dollars per month, so for most people it doesn't worth it). Now, imagine a cheap, 7 Mbps ""national"" Internet for everyone. <i>The Internet</i> can't compete with this new intranet...<p>[Edit] fix typo",1334049530

The success of a programming language has nothing to do with elegance and everything to do with raw capability, ie. what does the language make dramatically easier.<p>2. Technical warts will not prevent great things from being done in a language.  It's certainly true that Haskell will not allow you write as broken a piece of software as PHP, but in many cases you <i>can</i> write something just as elegant in PHP as you can in Haskell (laziness/pattern-matching/type-inference notwithstanding).<p>Now, personally I will do my best to ever write any PHP again, and if someone asks me my opinion I'll tell them that I believe using PHP exclusively will stunt your growth as a software craftsmen.  But those are just opinions.  I don't feel the need to go out and advocate <i>against</i> PHP because the software communities where I devote my attention are doing just fine.

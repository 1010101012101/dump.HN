One dose of MMR vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles if exposed to the virus, and two doses are about 97% effective. In the United States, widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. &quot;<p>And most people are vaccinated:<p><a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/12/science/la-sci-sn-cdc-measles-vaccines-20130912"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/12/science/la-sci-sn-cd...</a><p>&quot;The federal government targets 90% childhood vaccination rates.

Now the terminal can&#x27;t read the card, because there&#x27;s goop in the way. So you take your card out (which is now slightly cleaner, and thus likely to work on the next terminal.)<p>Next, someone else puts theirs in. Now the gunk is on the terminal contacts, and gets rubbed onto that person&#x27;s card, and once again, the card doesn&#x27;t work.

9042098,comment,9034570,9038903,0,0,wfo,,,"Right. This was the case many years ago (at least in the US) but now universities are essentially for profit corporations run by MBAs who care nothing for the mission of the institution, overloaded with administrative parasites who latch on to any profitable industry and spit platitudes about &#x27;education&#x27; and then turn around and stab it in the back. There has been a massive shift in governance of universities; if you go to any university you will see the faculty (read: the people who actually do the work of the university and are public intellectuals) have almost zero power, a token appointment or two in the puppet university governing body, not the board which makes the real decisions. This is happening for a number of reasons, partially because the short-term corporate profit agenda has infiltrated every industry no matter how noble (see: health care. Accountants decide what treatment you get, not a doctor. Businesspeople decide which doctors and nurses are doing a good job based on profits and cost-cutting, not a standard of care), which is really a result of a cut in funding. It&#x27;s essentially a result of a shift in culture; towards a culture indoctrinated into the religion of economics, valuing things only for their potential profit, using economic measures even when (especially when) they are inappropriate. Defunding art, education, health care, infrastructure, safety nets, anything with intangible or even long-term tangible value in favor of things which show up in short-term metrics. It&#x27;s especially prevalent among youth. Ask a college kid what&#x27;s important to him; he&#x27;ll say making money, period point blank. Everything else is secondary, if it even exists. Our world is a lot more cutt-throat than it was even 50 years ago, when intellectuals and professionals were respected, and there was a healthy middle class, not a quickly disappearing one, full of people trying to tread water in it or claw their way out by tooth and nail before being &quot;middle class&quot; means no more than barely eking out an existence for the short years you&#x27;re healthy to work at maximum productivity, but only with the permission of a high ranking member of the owning class (i.e. a &#x27;job&#x27;).",1423784776

ASCII abbreviations are an acceptable means to this end.  This would also eliminate a lot of the implementation difficulties and performance penalties of writing and using a parser.<p>Second, TLS and compression are not integrated into HTTP/1.1, meaning that people who want to be able to read an HTTP stream on the wire can do so by disabling these features.

But I also came away with a much greater appreciation for the basic model it uses, most of the biggest warts are at the surface (flip-flops, bizarre rules around how arguments get passed to blocks when the block takes one argument, etc). The way metaclasses work is, imo, one of the most elegant object models I&#x27;ve seen for the amount of power it gives you. It only took a couple hundred lines of code to implement reasonably correctly [2]. And along the way, I wrote another language for expressing some of the higher level VM-stuff (object model, exception propagation, etc).<p>I definitely recommend targeting languages that already have robust test suites. It makes things a lot easier. I was going to do a JS implementation a while ago, and there is a pretty solid suite for that from the ECMA[3], but it&#x27;s kind of hard to extract. One of the things that made ruby so fun was that the test suite that existed at the time was rubyspec, which is actually written in ruby.

The original Thorne-Hawking bet (scroll down past the more recent one on black hole information: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorne%E2%80%93Hawking%E2%80%93Preskill_bet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorne%E2%80%93Hawking%E2%80%9...</a>) was driven in part by discomfort with singularities. There was and is a feeling that <i>something</i> ought to make them go away, but we remain unsure if they really will, and until we have a genuine theory of quantum gravity our accounts of what happens at very high densities is going to be a bit hand-wavy.<p>So this article&#x27;s suggestion that the current situation is particularly new or different isn&#x27;t all that accurate. There have always been two senses of the meaning of &quot;the Big Bang&quot; and the degree of comfort people have had with singularities has varied over time (lower in the &#x27;60&#x27;s and &#x27;70&#x27;s, higher in the &#x27;80&#x27;s and &#x27;90&#x27;s, lower again today.)<p>Nor is it accurate to say that inflationary cosmology is completely uncontroversial and so well understood that we have no choice but to discard the initial singularity. Inflationary cosmologies are popular for good reasons, but they are not the only game in town--we recently saw a thing on Bohmian mechanics go by on HN that suggested an alternative to inflation, for example (I&#x27;m far from sold on the work, but use it simply as a way of pointing out that alternatives to inflation exist and can&#x27;t quite be discarded completely just yet.)",1423782878

You did this appallingly. You still seem to be puzzled why people still bring this up.<p>In a community project, people often do things you aren&#x27;t going to like. Ben rejected a push, and he steadfastly maintains that he did this for good reasons:<p><a href=""https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015#issuecomment-29568172"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015#issuecomment-29568...</a><p>Now instead of communicating with Ben, giving him the benefit of the doubt as a non-native speaker of English and calling him out publicly in the way you did was an absolute classic case of what you do NOT do.<p>In a community run project, the dynamics are different to being in a corporation. The first rule is: you are dealing with a lot of people, from a lot of different backgrounds. There is <i>lots</i> of room for misunderstanding. The absolute <i>golden rule</i> around dealing with a popular project is to try to wrangle this appropriately and with as little heat as possible.<p>So let&#x27;s review what you did:<p>1. You posted one of the most inflammatory, aggressive posts I&#x27;ve seen in a very long time. You took no time to talk to Ben about his position and to talk him around to making an apology and reversing his decision.<p>2. You compete with StrongLoop. You basically told your competitor that they should fire one of their best developers to the project. Your company may have been a main initiator of Node.js and you see it as largely the steward for the project, but your own employee reversed the decision of a major contributor.<p>And this is where you really stuffed up. For some time there had been rumblings about how Joyent was biased about the way they accepted commits and directed the project - rightly or wrongly. There was a perception of bias towards Joyent&#x27;s interests. That&#x27;s not necessarily a correct viewpoint. But you started a chain of events you now can&#x27;t control.<p>Joyent has finally setup a Foundation, but has now got a fork competing with the core project. StrongLoop is one of the groups backing io.js. A large number of your core developers are publicly backing io.js.<p>3. Community leaders, like yourself, aren&#x27;t meant to send abusive messages over blogs. You called him an arsehole. You called for his sacking.<p>Let&#x27;s underscore how tone-deaf you have been, and completely clueless over how to run an open source project:<p><i>&quot;While we would fire Ben over this, node.js is an open source project and one doesn&#x27;t necessarily have the same levers. Indeed, one of the challenges of an open source project that depends on volunteer effort is dealing with assholes&quot;</i><p>You don&#x27;t realise how much damage you did. I agree with gender neutral language in technical writing. Many others do as well. If you had dealt with this differently and not decided to become a self-aggrandizing pundit, then you would have probably shown that Joyent can deal with controversial matters maturely and civilly, play nicely with others, resolve conflict, and you&#x27;d have the high moral ground.<p>Now you just look like a bully, and I&#x27;d say you were the catalyst for the io.js fork. You also opened yourself up to your own past, which you also regret.<p>As I say - you&#x27;ve basically given us all a text-book case study into how not to manage an open source project.<p>P.S. FWIW, I upvoted you.",1423782514

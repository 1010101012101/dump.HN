Why are people loyal to a sports team, and in some cases willing to overlook a coach&#x27;s child molestation or player who is a rapist or thief? Why did the US switch from the spoils system to a civil service system? Why is there organizational retaliatory behavior towards whistle-blowers or those that file sexual harassment complaints?<p>Even without a definite &quot;why&quot;, I think these are all expressions of frequent human tendencies.

Some of those fixes will be in the next Racket release, and some in the one after that.<p>However, some of the performance overhead requires a more sophisticated compiler, just like higher order functions or objects.

For example, if you could issue a query to a medical case database like »What proportion of the population was born on this specific date in that specific small town with some specific eye color and has this illness?« you could potentially figure out whether or not one person has a specific illness by either getting zero or a very small percentage. One possible solution and what is mostly discussed in the article is adding some noise to the result, as little as possible to not make the query result meaningless but enough to protect each record.",1454867895

X isn&#x27;t responsible for any wrongdoing committed by M or others like M, so why should X suffer the consequences?<p>It&#x27;s fine to rectify past wrongs when X is responsible for the past wrongs, but guilt by identity association with M is absurd.

As such, the point of education is to expose and empower children (people, really) to have the tools they need to explore and discover the things that they _want_ to understand and master. You really can&#x27;t _make_ someone enjoy &quot;x&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is the passion of the teacher.<p>Programming, to me, is like writing, painting, or mathematics. In so much that it is a multi-faceted discipline. Coding is to writing as typing is to penmanship. There are _many_ reasons to write; from jotting down a grocery list to writing an epic novel, just as there are many reasons to code; from bulk automation/text transformation to diving into deep artificial intelligence. Just as there are many reasons to paint, and many reasons to do math. The &quot;how&quot; is dependent on the &quot;why&quot;.<p>Most people don&#x27;t learn to mix oil paint simply for the joys of mixing oil paints, most people don&#x27;t learn penmanship simply because they long to see a well formed letterform. Few people learn the how to take the functional derivative, simply because. It&#x27;s a means to an end; they learn to do it because they need to express something _else_.<p>I don&#x27;t expect every child in my english classes to go on to write a great non-fiction masterpiece or an epic novel. In fact, most of them wont, but I _do_ think its important that they are exposed to the fundamental skills involved; penmanship, vocabulary, basic composition, in the event they _do_ want to write, or code, or compute, or paint, or whatever...<p>I think &quot;school&quot; is exposure to the mechanics, and individuals who desire more will seek out the rest.",1454867726

If I had $50 million, my biggest concern would be keeping that money safe and lowering volatility.<p>In the case of $50m, you can fully invest it in the stock market, but you need to be ready for wild fluctuations in your wealth.  You also need to make sure the brokerage you gave the money to is reputable, or multiple brokerages.  (SIPC only covers up to $500,000). You also may accidently buy overly correlated products without knowing it or may think you are buying low risk (bond funds) only to find out that they had super high duration (risk from insurance rates changing).<p>You can always put it in banks, but even that can be risky in times of extreme turmoil.  During the last crisis, there were about 6 months when people were genuinely unsure whether all major banks would stay solvent.  You are only insured to FDIC limits which will not come close to $50m.<p>You could go with real estate, 100% cash purchase, where you have no debt.  (no leverage).  As long as you pick a liquid asset class, that is likely safe, but you still need to insure the property and make sure your management team is running it properly which requires a lot of hands on work.  You could still lose a lot of money if rates go up etc.<p>Having $50m is really a mo money mo problems scenario.  A robo advisor can&#x27;t fix it if you don&#x27;t want 100% stock market exposure.

Large multi-family office firms pool investments from multiple wealthy individuals (usually investable assets of at least $5M or more) and can access private equity, real-estate deals, commercial mortgages and more. These firms manage multiple billions of dollars, which doesn&#x27;t make them huge by any measurement, but they are more than large enough to access investment opportunities like these as well as create sufficient liquidity for their clients.<p>Wealthy individuals have access to investment strategies that resemble far more the philosophy of large pension funds than that of robo-advisors. (You can also check out Tiger 21, a sort of investment club for Wealthy people, they post their recommended asset allocations on a regular basis.) They also tend to be more focused on capital preservation and minimizing volatility than strictly beating the market. Their portfolios are typically highly diversified outside of publicly traded assets to accomplish that.<p>Finally, the firms that work with them offer significantly more for their money. Detailed estate planning and legacy planning, tax planning, corporate tax planning, and advice on charitable foundations and more.<p>While I do agree with some of what you are saying about how &quot;advice&quot; is priced, particularly when it comes to the mass market, there is definitely a point in the wealth of an individual where there couldn&#x27;t be more points of difference between what people get in terms of financial advice.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve worked at a wealth management firm that dealt with HNWI for quite some time.<p>Edit: Just to add a bit on the different this makes for HNWIs<p>At the firm I worked at their client&#x27;s biggest losses throughout 2008 were no more than 6-7% (after fees were considered), while at the same time being invested in assets that yielded nearly that much in cash flow through dividends, interest, etc. that same year. Since a portion of the portfolio was also invested in public equities (around 30%) and because these client&#x27;s could easily stomach the markets considering their personal performance they were able to ride it back up without fleeing to cash like so many others did.<p>One of the problem smaller investors face is that in major market crisis situations almost all publicly traded assets take a hit as the mass market migrates to cash.

Given that there hasn&#x27;t been a commonly advocated workflow that didn&#x27;t include some sort of CSS processor (like LESS or SASS) in about a decade, it seems like somebody working on the standards would have realized that CSS needed variables, at the very least. So, it&#x27;s cool that it&#x27;s coming, though it&#x27;s taken a lot longer than I reckon it probably should have.<p>I would normally say, &quot;But, at least there&#x27;s been time to work out the syntax in non-core projects, so things are probably nice now.&quot; But, this syntax and behavior doesn&#x27;t even resemble SASS or LESS. Is there some other tool out there that provides variables in CSS that this is modeled after? Why reinvent the wheel when so many people are already familiar with and have worked out the quirks in SASS or LESS?<p>Reading the explanation for why they went this way (in short, because these are nothing like SASS variables, in the sense that SASS is more like a macro): <a href=""http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4KT0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4KT0</a><p>Is somewhat unconvincing. Why not implement what&#x27;s already working for people in SASS/LESS (in the way it&#x27;s already working), and then move on to whatever it is they&#x27;ve implemented here later once it is clear it&#x27;s something people want/need and once it&#x27;s been worked out in pre-processors?

Among other reasons for shutting down, here is what the letter had to say on your question:<p>- The unintended consequences of those new regulations introduced as a result of the GFC, which have largely removed the market making role of investment banks from global equity markets, has coincided with the recent massive increase in market share of both ‘dumb’ index funds and ‘black box’ algorithmic funds to create a situation where equity market volumes have fallen sharply and individual stock volatility has risen dramatically. An initially badly executed order can now inadvertently create a price trend (because there is no longer the cushion to price moves which was in the past provided by market maker inventories) that, as algorithmic funds feast on it, can create a market event even if the initial order was a simple innocent error. Truly – to mix metaphors – butterflies flapping their wings now regularly create hurricanes that stop out fundamentally driven investors who cannot remain solvent longer than the market can remain irrational.<p>- In such a world dominated by index and algorithmic funds historically logical correlations between different asset classes can remain in place long after they have ceased to be logical. More butterflies.<p>- Index and algorithmic fund manoeuvrings also make it very hard to ascertain what the markets ‘clean’ positioning is at any given time.

I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d even imagine a game that could teach skills with good mapping to programming. They&#x27;re doing a good job. Prior to that, the best results we were getting were projects like the brilliant MIT Scratch that turned it into collaborative, creative, lego building (below). Should still invest in stuff like that, too, which is more direct but fun.<p><a href=""https://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scratch.mit.edu/</a><p>On other hand, that programming is a fundamental skill is an assertion that&#x27;s being repeated by many without evidence. It&#x27;s a useful skill that will become more useful as we go along. Yet, something like 80-90% of America, including top 1%, know nothing about programming despite their job success or quality of life. There&#x27;s no direct tie in. Meanwhile, they use reading/writing and mathematics on a regular basis. So, I think people should stop making this claim as most people will mentally tune out upon seeing something like that.<p>This brings to a bigger point where software isn&#x27;t engineered despite prior work showing how to do it. That started with Margaret Hamilton and Dijkstra in the 1960&#x27;s where both of them used modularity, layering, and interface checks to build flawless systems. By the 1980&#x27;s, Hansen had safe concurrency (Concurrent Pascal), Mill&#x27;s Cleanroom let teams hit almost no defects first try, LISP machines let you live-edit, incrementally-develop running systems w/ no compile phase, Schell had a NSA-resistant kernel (GEMSOS) that ran other things as processes/containers on virtual CPU&#x27;s (sound familiar?), and Wirth&#x27;s simplicity + safe language approaches let ETH run on their students&#x27; OS&#x27;s. Each of these approaches led, with small teams, to systems that reached high levels of security, reliability, extensibility, and (for Lisp machines) productivity.<p>Yet, the techniques that built them are largely not used by mainstream. The negative results are predictable. So, we have two problems: (a) getting nonprogrammers into programming so they can solve problems with <i>some</i> approach and toolset; (b) getting programmers into <i>engineering</i> so they can build robust, maintainable systems using lessons learned from the past. Like other engineering fields do. So far, we&#x27;re doing better at (a). Some good news at least.",1454866863

There&#x27;s a corpus of several centuries of findings, derivations, and unresolved controversies precisely _because_ it is nontrivial. (Side note: the existence of controversies that divide different schools of thought does not mean that everything is in question and that absolutely anything goes because, hey, we can always argue with words by distancing ourselves from observable reality — that makes for religion not science, albeit even the dismal kind.)<p>Second: the general idea is that there exists a dynamic, complex system constituted of agents (people, sometimes aggregated into firms and/or nations, being almost always simultaneously consumers of something in need of everything except that which they are suppliers of, be it labour, materials, knowledge, time in the form of lending money, whatever) each doing their best to maximise the enjoyment (utility) of what they have by interacting in a series of ‘markets’, which for the sake of analysis we generally are forced to assume are in ‘equilibrium’ (i.e. We&#x27;re at the “end of history“ where no external bumps or surprises are leaking into the market and nudging it in any direction)  but in truth we know to be in perpetual disequilibrium as information percolates in, surprises happen, and generally guesstimates of everybody involved are shown to right at best on average. An equilibrium price comes to exist where supply and demand cross and we spend many a happy hour calculating that and then trying to figure out how a ‘shocked’ system returns to equilibrium if we jolt it.<p>Thirdly: money is (surprisingly enough, for the public which seems to conflate economics and accounting) not necessarily the domain of economics. As a whole the discipline deals with incentives (most usefully and generically regarded as differences in subjective utility) and responses thereto (utility maximising strategies). Money is at best something that serves as a denominator to give everything a common unit and, at worst, an irksome distortion. This is one of those “school of thought” controversies I mentioned above: there are monetarists within the domain of economics and there is the separate domain of finance, somewhere between accounting and economics, and to which ‘risk’ (uncertain future outcomes) is an essential ingredient — and governmental fiscal policy (taxation and public spending)... that&#x27;s yet another thing.<p>For the sake of reading I suggest (no offence intended) Managerial Economics For Dummies, The Origin Of Wealth (Eric Beinhocker), and The Social Atom (Mark Buchanan).<p>P.S.

To do something, a frontend has to make 6 calls just to gather data before it is even ready to present a page of UI.<p>I&#x27;m not making an argument against microservices, just the architecture of exposing data in tiny self-contained (self-absorbed?) chunks. Microservices can expose data that people may want in those tiny pieces, but they should be wrapped up together by other services to aggregate related data to expose to consumers that need to care about workflow.

When a recently minted MBA looks at Github as a great career option, it&#x27;s probably too late.<p>Ironically, that&#x27;s why the money was invested in the first place, to be able to afford people like that, because the investors believe that creating a gamified system for money-driven people will result in a payout.<p>Github could have continued to grow organically instead of taking $100M.  Since the $100M there hasn&#x27;t been any significant new functionality on the web version of the site, and there have been fewer blog posts from the early team of people who many of us met and respected.<p>I assumed something was awry when Kneath left, he was a symbol of the culture at GH that was a legit, bootstrapped startup culture.  He loved the product and evangelized it in a way that was clearly a labor of love.<p>The sexual-harassment stuff is unfortunate, but organizations of primates have things like that happen now and then, it&#x27;s just rare that the victims decide to go public.  This does not excuse it but it doesn&#x27;t necessary say anything about the culture (I&#x27;ve seen female-founded, progressive firms tolerate very bad behavior from male employees).<p>Maybe Github should split into a corporate division and an open source division.  The OSS division could make all of its work and decision making distributed and public, and the corporate division could do business development and attack new market opportunities.",1454864543

Rhoma has a long history of conducting fair and impartial investigations, with 30+ years of HR experience. She has worked with every type of organization, from Fortune 50 companies to local governments, and frequently testifies as an expert witness for both plaintiffs and defendants in depositions, arbitrations, and in litigation involving discrimination, harassment, retaliation, disability, and mitigation of damages...</i><p><i>...We gave Rhoma free rein to review all the media reports, public allegations, and HR records so she could create her own investigation and interview plan. She identified three key issues that she focused her investigation on: the claims about Tom and his wife, the claims about the male engineer, and the general culture and working environment at GitHub... The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his capacity as GitHub’s CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints, insensitivity to the impact of his spouse&#x27;s presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office. There were also issues surrounding the solicitation of GitHub employees for non-GitHub business and the inappropriate handling of employee concerns regarding those solicitations...</i><p><i>...The investigation found no information to support misconduct or opportunistic behavior by the engineer against Julie or any other female employees in the workplace. Furthermore, there was no information found to support Julie’s allegation that the engineer maliciously deleted her code. The commit history, push log, and all issues and pull requests involving Julie and the accused engineer were reviewed. The investigation considered all possible commits surrounding the accusation of passive-aggressive code removal... After interviewing over 50 employees, former employees, and reviewing evidence, Rhoma found nothing to support a sexist or discriminatory environment at GitHub, and no information to suggest retaliation against Julie for making sex/gender harassment complaints.</i>",1454864432

GitHub needs at least 5,000 employees.<p>It seems like your heart is in the right place but the quoted statement reads to me as a total non-sequitur. What model are you using to justify your calls for GitHub to hire 9x it&#x27;s current number of employees?<p>What would these 4.5K new employees be doing exactly?<p>At the end of the day they provide a useful way to store and version control a code base, but the enterprise software market is very crowded and GitHub being in vogue could be a fad that gets eclipsed by something else, just like how HipChat was THE thing for teams until Slack.<p>Arbitrarily saying that &quot;Google will birth AI and they need at least 1M employees to make it happen&quot; is something that, in my opinion, sounds similarly vapid from any kind of quantitative or forecasting standpoint.<p>Would like to know how the figure was estimated, and how mentioning Yahoo is relevant in the least. They have a huge stake in Alibaba, and yahoos business model is a defacto investment company, with Yahoo standalone value [yhoo market cap - (yhoo stake in baba)*(market cap of baba)]  around -15B last I checked. It&#x27;s not even apples and oranges, it&#x27;s like grapes vs dolphins - meaningless comparison<p>Edit: fixed my yhoo/baba math for clarity",1454864410

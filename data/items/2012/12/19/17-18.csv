Unfortunately, legally they can pretty much do whatever they want as long as they include enough fine print that nobody ever reads in the ToS. I think you are arguing from a legal perspective, which you're absolutely right about; I'm talking about ""the right way to treat your customers"" perspective.<p>If I as a customer pay any amount (including $0.00) and agree to the terms of service, the company should honor those terms, or, at the very least, be forthcoming with how they will handle my data.<p>The reason people are angry is because:<p>a) They didn't have any inclination of how Instagram will try to monetize. I think you are giving users way too much credit in how these startups work (ask your non-tech-savvy friends how Facebook or Google make money; I guarantee you will get blank stares).  The customers who joined before Facebook took over signed a completely different set of ToS. Again, there is nothing obliging them legally to grandfather these customers, but it's not a nice thing to do ""Thanks for the ToS. Btw, Facebook took over, so good luck!""<p>b) They tried to sneak in the changes and got caught. Nobody likes to have stuff done behind their back, so a big announcement with enough lead time to switch services would be nice. I don't use Instagram anyway, but I think this applies in general in how to treat your customers.",1355939962

4943760,comment,4943186,4943277,3,0,betterunix,,,"""Where did do-no-track even come from?""<p>Well, the argument from the advertisers is this:  they have no idea whether or not people want to be tracked, so they don't know when it is not OK to do so (i.e. they are claiming to be autistic).  Maybe some people really do want to be tracked and given advertisements that are more relevant to their interests, according to the advertisers, and so having browsers block tracking systems would hurt those users; also, they like to remind us, invasive advertising funds the web (but I have my doubts about that point).  DNT is supposed to give users a way to opt out of invasive advertising that does not involve simply blocking ads; we are supposed to accept this compromise, because otherwise we'll just be in another arms race (which I suspect we will win, given how effective ABP is at blocking ads).<p>The theory is that the industry can self-regulate, because we are holding the Sword of Damocles over their heads:  we already showed them that we can block pop-ups, pop-unders, hover ads, Flash ads, Java ads, and the numerous other things they came up with.  We also showed them that we can win an arms race, by making spam filters so effective that the volume of spam actually began to decrease.<p>Of course, for DNT to work, the number of ABP installations would have to spike whenever the advertisers prove that they are not acting in good faith.  Which is what they did when they tried to claim that DNT meant users don't want to <i>see</i> targeted ads, but that it was still OK to collect tracking data.  To me, that suggests that DNT is already over and that we need to finish the game by making ABP a standard feature.",1355939830

In the United Kingdom, it is a criminal offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to refuse to hand over an encryption key when required. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that suspects do not seek to evade the provision by utilizing several layers of encryption and multiple keys to protect different data sets. For example, a setting of TruCrypt, a common free encryption tool, allows a suspect to encrypt a hard drive and create two passwords: one for the clean drive and the other containing the incriminating material. This can be circumvented by ensuring that the forensic examination of the hard drive takes into consideration whether there is any missing volume of data.</i><p>If they had actually installed TrueCrypt and created a hidden partition or read the documentation, they would see that the other partition lies about space usage to prevent its existence from being provable",1355939489

4943715,comment,4940434,4942796,3,0,lsc,,,">2, the idea is that your incentives are the same: you'll be upholding bourgeoisie society. The whole point of the 'petite bourgeois' designation refers to the awkwardness of a group of people who _should_ be proletariat, but have juuuust enough incentive to act against that interest, because they're almost bourgeoise<p>It's more complex than that.  And the explanation I always got was that the petit bourgeois acted against their own interest because they aspired to be and thought of themselves as likely to become part of the capitalist class, not that they shared real interest with the capitalist class.<p>Management actively steals from the capitalist class.  The last thing that management wants, for instance, is shareholder rights. In fact, they side with labour more often than they side with capital, as far as I can see.  Look at Yahoo in 2008.   Any fool could have seen that the Microsoft buyout offer was the best yahoo could do.   And Yahoo shareholders clamoured to make the deal.   But management killed the deal, siding with the employees, and destroying a great deal of value for the capitalists.<p>One can argue, in fact, that labour rights (which is to say, making it more complex and legally dangerous to hire or fire someone)  is in the best interest of management, as it means that a Capitalist would have to learn significantly more before they could take an active role in managing what they own.<p>Owner-operators... culturally, you see that same aspiring up against our own interest.   Our interests are aligned with the capitalists on labour issues, certainly;  Much like the capitalists and unlike management, we want to be able to hire and fire without complexity, and as a class, we generally don't value job security, or really even comprehend why job security is such a huge deal to the workers.  But otherwise?  We have radically different interests.  Owner operators are just as likely, if not more likely to need 'safety net' type social services than similarly skilled workers.  One can make a good argument that owner-operators benefited more than any other class from the affordable care act.<p>In fact, on one of the biggest issues of the day, owner-operators have interests aligned with the workers against the capitalists:   Capital gains taxes.  Nearly all owner operators, outside of real-estate, pay full income taxes on most of their income;  We'd be better off if the government taxed all income as income and just lowered the income tax rate to make up for it.  And the difference in what you pay is huge.  Like more than 50%.  This is the primary reason why everyone thinks that an exit strategy is so important;  building up a company that can be sold to a capitalist is the most realistic way for an owner operator to pay that lower capital gains rate.  It's hugely damaging, too;  it makes us act like management;  like our customers are the capitalists rather than the people who buy our products or services.<p>Capitalists and management (through stock grants/options) get to pay the (much lower) capital gains rate on most of their income.",1355939157

Kodak I think is more of a story of distracted noncommittal execution combined with the standard woes of dramatically changing the primary competency of a large company to something entirely different.<p>Contrary to popular belief, Kodak didn't stick its head in the sand while digital ate the world - they were there right at the beginning.<p>Kodak literally invented the digital camera in 1975, though obviously it was wildly impractical at the time. More importantly, they were first to market with a DSLR all the way back in 1993: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak_DCS_100"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak_DCS_100</a><p>Yeah, get a load of that backpack you needed to carry ;)<p>They continued releasing DSLRs until 2004, when they were obviously hopelessly outgunned by Canon and Nikon.<p>Beyond cameras, they were, for a long time, the only people working on digital sensors at all (besides Canon), and they supplied many of Canon's competitors. The sensors themselves were no slouches technically either - they were highly competitive for their time. Perhaps most famously, Kodak supplied the sensors in the Leica M8 and M9, both of which were known at the time for their incredible image quality, and optical achievement (i.e. microlensing to reduce the flange-focal distance). In fact, for a short time Kodak supplied Canon themselves.<p>OEMs abandoned Kodak in droves only in the last few years, when their financial troubles made the prospect of building an entire product around their sensors questionable. This, obviously, did no favors for Kodak. The rise of other medium format sensor companies also ate their top end market for lunch - Phase One and Leaf (now Mamiya-Leaf) being most notable.<p>So all of this sounds pretty rosy, so why did Kodak die? It's really hard to say. I suspect a large part of the problem was that becoming the world's digital imaging sensor vendor would not have financially supported a company the size of Kodak, even if they had committed to that path, and the company was loathe to downsize and reorganize the workforce to something that they would barely recognize.<p>So they branched into many other lines of business that were, even at the time, poor bets. They targeted low-margin markets (HP style!) and went hardcore into digital photo frames and various cheapo consumer knick-knacks that you might find at Sharper Image. IMO this was a large distraction that never should have been pursued in the first place. They even tried to copy HP by going in on the printer-ink business. That failed too.<p>Their stance in the digital imaging aspect of their business was always a bit noncommittal. IMO Kodak would have survived if they trimmed their business down and became <i>the</i> image sensor R&D company of the world. Their work force was too large and committed to the wrong lines of business all the way to the end.<p>Interesting note: Kodak's film business is actually profitable.",1355938500

If I re-write this in APL --and you know APL-- reading the solution is pretty linear:<p><pre><code>    R  data BETWEEN limits\n    R  ((data>limits[1])(data<limits[2]))/data\n\n    R  a COMMON b\n    R  (/a .= b)/a\n\n    x  2 8 7 9 5 0 2\n    y  1 3 10 0 8 9 1\n\n    x_btwn  x BETWEEN 2 10\n    y_btwn  y BETWEEN 2 9\n    xy_common  x_btwn COMMON y_btwn\n</code></pre>\nIf you know APL the above pretty much reads like the palm of your hand.<p>Since APL is unknown to most, here's a quick explanation.<p><pre><code>    R  data BETWEEN limits\n</code></pre>\nDyadic function declaration.  Takes two arguments.<p><pre><code>    R  ((data>limits[1])(data<limits[2]))/data\n</code></pre>\nLet's break this up:<p><pre><code>    (data>limits[1])\n</code></pre>\nTakes the ""data"" vector and compares it to the first element in ""limits"", which happens to be the ""low"" limit.  You get a binary vector as the result with a ""1"" anywhere the comparison is true and ""0"" otherwise.<p>If ""limits"" is 2 10:<p><pre><code>    0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n</code></pre>\nNow:<p><pre><code>    (data<limits[2])\n</code></pre>\nDoes the same thing with the upper limit:<p><pre><code>    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n</code></pre>\nThen:<p><pre><code>    0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1   \n</code></pre>\nPerforms a logical AND of the two binary vectors, resulting in a new vector:<p><pre><code>    0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n</code></pre>\nFinally:<p><pre><code>    R  0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0/data\n</code></pre>\nSelects elements from the ""data"" vector based on the values in the binary vector and returns the result vector:<p><pre><code>    8 7 9\n</code></pre>\nAnyhow, that's why I think that language is important.

4943639,comment,4942060,4943123,2,0,azakai,,,"> It is my opinion that Google open-sources Android for the PR benefit.<p>Clearly Android is less open than some OSes, but I don't agree it was open sourced just for PR. There is also a huge benefit in that many other parties have picked up Android as the basis for their products, which would not happen if it were not open source. For example, the kindle, nook, various chinese-market devices, etc.<p>There isn't always a big benefit to that, Google doesn't directly make money from the kindle to my knowledge. But (1) it prevents another OS from being used in those places and getting a foothold in the market, and (2) it creates a large potential ecosystem of developers and apps, even if things don't just work across that entire ecosystem, they are much closer to doing so than say between Android and Blackberry OS. If versions of Android dominate the market, Google is in a great position to benefit from that, even if ""official Android"" is just part of that.<p>That strategy has been a huge success over the last few years. Much more useful than any PR benefits.",1355938401

However, this was on the opposite coast, and since I've been in the Bay Area, I've been working at other people's startups. I'm a bit out of the contractor networking loop.<p>What I'm looking for is some piece of something a startup wants or needs to do immediately, but doesn't have time.<p>I'm altering the details on this example so that I'm not breaking an NDA, but the most promising candidate out of the leads I've received is an online service that needs a simple desktop based upload/sync application. I'd be writing the upload/sync app. Stuff like that is what I'm most interested in.",1213307628

216328,comment,216065,216196,0,0,apathy,,,"funny, I was just thinking that.  I'd love to work on twitter, not so much because I care about the service, but because it's fundamentally hard, and that's cool.  Personally I wonder why someone hasn't already transitioned Twitter to a publish-subscribe architecture internally, and used a bunch of queues to buffer the impact of load spikes ( a slow tweet is not the same as a dropped tweet! ).  But who knows if MySQL is really the best backbone for that anyways.<p>I will be interested to see where Zawodny <i>does</i> go.  His tools have been worth a lot to me over the years, and he communicates well, so he ought to provide a ton of value to whatever his next gig may be.<p>Too bad for Yahoo.  This and other high-profile departures may be coincidental, but rule #1 of a successful career is that you don't burn your bridges.  So the kind words on exit don't really mean anything to me.  I've pulled this sort of stunt before myself, as I swam away from a sinking ship whispering sweet nothings to the crew.",1213306963

In the US/UK you need to be a member of the bar/law-society to practice as a lawyer/solicitor (i.e. represent clients) but there is no reason why the actual work itself cannot be outsourced.<p>In fact most of the menial work in many law firms are done by juniors (new graduates) or legal-executives (""executives"" being people who have little or no law qualification but are able to do the work).<p>In my old firm (<a href=""http://www.lawdit.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lawdit.co.uk</a>), which I setup years ago with my friends, this was and still is the case in many ways.<p>I have seen the internals of many other leading firms (Allen & Overy, Ashurst, etc.) that also do this.<p>Hence, regardless of how powerful the legal lobby against an uptake of such outsource practice, I dare say, the bottom-line and almighty dollar will win in many cases.<p>After all, if you are getting the same/better quality at a lower cost and faster turn-around (3 people working on a task instead of 1) what would you do?<p>The precedents have already been set in other fields/industries so I expect it will not cause as much furore as one might imagine and will probably start with the thin end of the wedge i.e. no-win-no-fee farms.<p>Time will tell :)",1213306728

They are both businesses and any business takes time to build up to a point where you can make a living from that business.  It also takes time.  There will likely be times when you are freelancing where you don't have enough time or energy left over at the end of the day to work on your other projects.<p>Networking is definitely important for freelancing.  You have to let people know what you know and that you are available.  Finding someone to work on a project can be hard and you need to be on the top of the short lists of candidates when people are looking for help.<p>Another way to start freelancing is by establishing yourself as a known expert in niche communities.  This takes time and effort but when you get to that point and people are looking for dev help in that niche then your name will come up.",1213306138

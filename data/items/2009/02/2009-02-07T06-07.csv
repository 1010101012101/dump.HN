Or maybe it was popular because it was good.<p>* ""[...] [M]ade headlines after 10-year-old twins registered for his course with their mother â€“ and he supported the filing of a human-rights complaint claiming ageism when the university said they couldn't stay.""<p>Supporting their filing shouldn't be grounds for dismissal; sounds like he was just going through the appropriate channels.

470853,comment,470353,470625,0,0,ja2ke,,,"I think the quality of that piece of advice depends on a few things.<p>One obvious one is the audience you're expecting. If you're selling to a bunch of other coders, maybe a great design is less important than your feature list and the first-glance at documentation. If you're trying to do something social aimed at college students, or moms, or something, it may become worth considering, depending on the second point.<p>The other, less obvious (and less insulting than it sounds) one is, frankly, if you're any good at design. This might sound harsh (and will maybe be disregarded coming from a designer), but good design is harder, and more subtle, than most people think. Many programmers (and managers/producers/friends/pets) know just enough about design to be dangerous. Unlike the source code, <i>everyone</i> on a project sees the design, and <i>everyone</i> has seen and interacted with a million designed websites and front-end interfaces. Hell, most people on most teams have probably built their own full site from scratch, often many times over.<p>What that means is that when it comes to the design of your site and whether or not to call an outsider, you need to be honest with yourself. Do you know enough, or do you know enough to be dangerous? When you're making decisions about how a piece of art looks, or how a point of interaction works, are you thinking first and then acting, or are you acting first on something that seems cool and then retroactively filling in reasons behind that act to reassure yourself that you're being smart? Do you like a widget on that site because it maps to a specific end-user need you're trying to fulfill, or because of their fancy javascript implementaton?<p>As for wanting to learn to be a better designer, I think my best advice is to not do it on the job. If your motivation is truly to learn and gain skills for the future, it makes no sense to risk your current project by using it as a classroom for your own benefit. Would you let your graphics designer friend check chunks of code into your site to teach him how to program?<p>If it is a matter of not having the funds, then obviously you must make the best with what you've got! If what you've got is yourself, no free time, and no money, then there is definitely some excellent advice for how to inspire yourself in a pinch spread across this thread.<p>If you have time, though, I think that as a designer, beginning or seasoned, the most important question to ask at any juncture is ""why?"" Most of the advice earlier in the thread seems to stop at ""I find some colors that I like and just use them."" That's sound advice, as long as it takes the next step! Why did the designer of this other bicycles-themed site choose these colors? Were they really trying to communicate some mood or tone or feeling about the product, or has their parent company's logo just been a blue and yellow plaid since 1936? Why did the designer of this site decide to make the login panel side down instead of just appear instantaneously? Further, why wasn't the login panel simply visible the whole time, why was the decision made to hide it by default in the first place? Was there some sort of intended user behavior or control of site flow there, or was someone just excitedly jerking off because they'd discovered ui.jquery.com?<p>If you have the time to explore, start a smaller or less risky project, personal page, or hobby endeavor, and use that to learn the ropes, to find out what your strengths are, what you like about designing things. That might sound a tad touchy-feely, but finding out what you like about design and what you do well will help you when its time to sit down and do something real.<p>Also, if after some exploration, you do find that design really just isn't you for whatever reason, your best bet is to instead spend the time learning the language of design so you can properly talk to and problem-solve with people who <i>are</i> really into design and (if they're good) share your goals of building quality things. Learn the basic terms surrounding typography and colors, of desktop publishing and layout. Learn what is complicated for a designer and what is easy, and remember that, like programming, while designers strive to achieve results which look very simple and clean to ""outsiders,"" the path they take to get there is never as easy and simple looking as the output it presents.<p>That was certainly more rambling than I intended. Sorry, guys.",1233987070

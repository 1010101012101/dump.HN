So what I did was take the redis protocol (you use it via redis-cli or any client) and a few of its basic ideas: key=><data struct>, snapshot persistence, the overall command syntax idioms, master/slave replication, pubsub - and stripped everything but the very basic system commands. Oh, and also the concept of single threadedness seemed to be wasted on Go.<p>The rest is implemented inside isolated plugins that do not need to know about network or disk, and are just responsible for managing creation, serialization and manipulation of data structs. PubSub and such are achieved via Go channels, and locking is done on a key level, with reader/writer locks. The rest is pretty straight forward.<p>Besides some basic commands (strings, hashes, pubsub, monitor), I've added prefix search and json storage with sub node manipulation, with (relatively) very few lines of code. Although Go doesn't support dynamic loading of libraries, the idea is that you compile the database with the plugins you want, since Go's compiler is amazingly fast.<p>I haven't opened it yet, and pressure at work prevents me from progressing lately, but if anyone is interested in collaborating on this, I'd be glad to write about it in more detail and/or put it out there.",1367873279

    education is so poor that many people don't truly 
    understand what math is. Beyond arithmetic and algebra,
    they think it's some really complicated stuff with big 
    numbers and funny symbols that geeky people with glasses
    do -- it's practically a foreign language to them, 
    except it has a reputation for being much harder.
</code></pre>
I can attest to this. Academically, I am a reasonably able person, but I found math simply baffling at school. Arithmetic and algebra were fine. Rudimentary geometry made sense. When we got to trigonometry, things just fell apart for me. We were taught sine, cosine and tangent in the context of how they could be used to derive angles from other angles, not what they <i>were</i> and how they <i>worked</i>. They were presented as tools that could be used in particular ways that had to be memorized. To me, it felt like trying to teach an alien from another dimension to use a hammer without the alien having any intrinsic understanding of mass or momentum or kinetic energy or friction.<p>In fact, if I'm totally honest, I'm not 100% I completely understand the sine function now. And it wasn't just math. In physics, current, voltage, resistance etc. were taught as inputs to formulas. I know it must be challenging to teach about these kinds of principles that lack concrete macroscopic analogs, but I can't help but feel they could have done a better job than they did. In chemistry too, I remember being taught about valency and how you could work out the valency of an element by its position on the periodic table. I asked what valency actually <i>was</i>, either didn't understand or wasn't satisfied with the answer, asked again, and the teacher brushed off my question and carried on the with the lesson. ""Oh well,"" I thought, ""I guess I don't understand chemistry."" That was when I was about 12 years old, and I didn't study chemistry after that. I studied biology until I was 16 because I had a teacher who took the time to actually explain things.<p>The worst part is, I went to a pretty good school. It must be absolutely dreadful at bad schools.<p>Most of this happened before I had regular access to the internet and the chance to learn about these things for myself. I can't help but feel the whole course of my schooling and advanced education might have been different had I had better (or at least different) teachers of hard science and math at an early age.",1367872871

The biggest one is any sort of messaging application - your app doesn't actually execute any code when a notification comes in, so when your user reacts to the notification and launches your app, your app has to go and re-fetch much of the same data that the notification already carried. This comes across to the user as being slow and finicky.<p>- Basic UI paradigms are behind what the community is pushing. This isn't a lag behind <i>competing</i> OSes, but rather lagging behind itself. Apple used to be the flag-bearer for the state of the art of iOS UX, but the community has largely taken over to both good and bad results. See: pull to refresh, launch screens, side menus, etc. Apple can, and should, reclaim its position as being at the leading edge of its own platform.<p>- Lack of a proper inter-app communications channel. Intents on Android is very powerful, something like this is totally lacking in iOS.<p>- Lack of customizability when it comes to core functions.

It has the privileged position of being the only language that runs in the browser, so if you want to do any kind of client-side scripting, it's JavaScript or nothing.<p>This makes the emergence of frameworks to smooth over the language's pain points inevitable. If jQuery had never been invented, Prototype or Mootools or one of the zillion other frameworks would have taken over the world. But JavaScript's monopoly over scripting the browser is what drove all those frameworks' popularity, not the other way around.<p><i>""JavaScript has some things that are fundamentally wrong with it that no amount of covering up or pretending will fix.""</i><p>As long as JavaScript is the only way to script the browser, whether JS is fundamentally flawed or not is sort of an academic question. It remains the only way to get from point A to point B regardless of its flaws.<p><i>""Even though the world seems bright and cheery for JavaScript developers today, it also seemed equally bright and cheery for Blackberry devs not too long ago. And look how that turned out.</i>""<p>Blackberry devs are getting pummeled because there was somewhere else for Blackberry users to go. Where else are JavaScript users supposed to go to script the browser? There is no alternative.<p>""<i>Take JavaScript away and replace it with another programming language and you dont really miss anything.</i>""<p>Except that in practice, <i>you can't do that.</i> <i>Browser vendors</i> can do that, but none of them appear to have any interest in doing so. (The article mentions Dart, but Dart compiles to JavaScript.) And that's not even considering what would happen if all the browser vendors backed different languages... oy.<p>Way back in the earliest days of browser scripting, it was thought that languages would be 'pluggable' -- that there'd be, say, a Python plugin for your browser, and devs would be able to script the browser in Python through it. (Which is why up until HTML5 SCRIPT elements were required to include a TYPE attribute; it was assumed that ""application/javascript"" would be just one type among many.) But that never happened.<p><i>""You can only build so much on top of something else, before you have to wipe the slate clean and start over.""</i><p>There's no practical way to wipe the JS slate clean. JS is out there, right now, baked into a gazillion different browsers and devices. Even if you come up with a better alternative, how do you get it into enough of those browsers and devices to create the critical mass required for developers to start writing for it?<p>The only practical answer is that you get them into <i>new</i> browsers and devices, and then wait for all the old ones to die or be replaced. Which means that if something really does rise up and try to replace JS, you will have pleeeenty of lead time to get ready for the change. Like, <i>decades</i> of it.",1367871363

It might do well, but it has several major hurdles to get past before it could be thought of as any sort of threat to the XBOX or Playstation platforms. Ditto Steam Box. (Although I'd put my money on Valve over Ouya.)<p>Third: No talk in this article about how Sony and Microsoft might need to fight off other very large players that want to take over your TV set? My new Samsung TV has games like Angry Birds built right into it. They suck, but it's definitely a sign that they might move further in that direction. And I assume Apple will eventually open up the Apple TV platform for third party developers to release games. Those seem like <i>much</i> bigger threats to Sony and MS.<p>Especially Apple. AAA game studios already release games for the Mac -- porting to a new Apple TV flavor of iOS (or whatever) might not be that big of a step. And, unlike Ouya (for example), Apple has a proven ability to attract <i>massive</i> numbers of independent developers to build for their platforms.<p>Anyway, I don't necessarily disagree with his point that Sony and Microsoft might need to move a bit more nimbly on these new systems, but I don't think the author of the article has really drilled down to the true reasons.

Why ? because a webpage is just a string blob.<p>I live in france, and here, youtube is barely usable anymore, because everybody uses it. Streaming sucks, because video on demand is the worst pitfall of the internet architecture.<p>Websites are great for static pages. It's also great to advertise things, because html is easy, and quickly doable. But for other things, I don't believe it's really worth it. I dare you to find a html5, lightweight internet browser that can do optimized javascript, for what, checking your gmail, and connect to the facebook server farm? Why not using a mail application instead ? And then come up with SPDY, which is not so fast anyway.<p>Not everybody wants websites. People also like to share files, do video conferences, which are not possible with a centralized network, or really painful and expensive. Think about skype and bittorrent.<p>Those are economic alternatives because access network are not only expensive, they're not technologically viable.<p>Saying p2p is not viable because it is slow is a joke, because the way we use the network to make websites is already slow and require tremendous amounts of bandwidth.

This requires a different type of mental juggling than the above.<p>And then there are those who just have to memorize a lot of problems.<p>When I was in school, we started off with memorization (multiplication tables and such), which requires a <i>large</i> time investment that I am sure many students did not make. (My peer group tended to stay inside during recces and practice our multiplication!) After that I think we were supposed to ""naturally"" progress to breaking problems down into parts, but that was never really covered all that well. From what I understand, other countries make this part of learning arithmetic very explicit.<p>A good deal of this involves training ones working memory. Right at the end of college my working memory for numbers was amazing, I could do 3 digit divides in my head, and at one point I could even do a binary search to find logarithms down to a decimal place or two!<p>But as with many other skills, they degrade from a lack of use.<p>29/3? I have a minor on mathematics. If you give me that problem, I'd honestly type ""win-r calc 29/3 enter"".<p>Now days I have problems just adding up large strings of numbers, I play a bunch of D10 games and I have to actually do math rather than it coming to me instantly!<p>> People keep forgetting that brains CAN be very specialized, and be great with something, and terrible with other,<p>Well yes of course, but we choose what to specialize in! I really do believe that anyone can learn math if they put the time and effort into it. My math classes took 2-3 hours a day of studying a good 4 days a week in order for me to completely grasp the concepts being taught.<p>Repetition of hundreds of problems, as much as I hated it, was the only real way to burn technique into my head, and even then most of those techniques have fallen by the way side! A few still bounce around inside my skull, but it has been a good 8 years since my last math class, so the amazing feats of mental gymnastics I could perform are long gone.<p>On the flip side, ask me to design a test infrastructure for code sometime, and I'm right on it! How about a custom memory allocation scheme? No problem! Specialization indeed.",1367870676

You have extrapolated that to a theory about all abused children that is even less likely to be correct than the first.  You have concluded from that that you see no point in actually trying the experiment and collecting data because it is guaranteed to fail.<p>Your initial theory about me is incorrect.  After years of abuse I got to that point, sure.  But I didn't start there.  I believe from my own memories of myself that there was a period where I would be willing to try it, and a period where I wouldn't.<p>Your generalization of my experience (which you weren't there for and know almost nothing about) is even less correct than your initial theory.  I was but one child with one set of experiences.  Different children react differently.  Different children go through different patterns of abuse.  My description is anecdote, not data.<p>And finally your absolute certainty that it is useless to even try is nothing short of absolutely galling.  On what evidence do you give up before trying?  I've got a heck of a lot more experience/knowledge than you do, and I certainly don't think it is hopeless to try this!  (I don't necessarily think it will work, but it seems like a promising idea.)<p>As for the message itself, well, I am not in a position to judge.  Ideally it was crafted with input from people who had suffered the exact kind of abuse they are targeting about what would have been most likely to work for them.  I know that the most effective messages are often not what someone without experience would guess them to be.  They've got more knowledge about physical abuse than I do.<p>My experience was sexual abuse, which is different in many ways.  But if it shows any signs of effectiveness for one then it can be repeated with messages aimed at other kinds of victims.<p>For sexual abuse I might suggest a message along the lines of, <i>He says you asked for it, and it sometimes feels good.  But it is wrong and you don't want it.  We understand.  We can make it stop.</i><p>Why that message?  Because the best way to show you actually understand is to state the deepest, darkest truth of sexual abuse.  Which is that abusers try to convince themselves and their victims that this is an act of love, and children are not equipped with the emotional maturity to distinguish ""this feels good"" from ""I want this"".<p>(That message might be a bit too raw.  I've known a lot of adults who were unable to look back at their own abuse and face that statement.  And explaining it to your kids would be extremely hard.  But it is a statistical certainty that they will have kids in their classrooms who are actually GOING through that, but nobody knows it...)",1367870673

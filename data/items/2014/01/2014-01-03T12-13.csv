Now if I&#x27;m trying to create an overview of how say emacs works, I would try to identify the main sub-parts and break the system down into more manageable chunks of study. This is all what &#x27;viewpoints&#x27; are trying to structure. None of this is evident from just the codebase unless it has been captured in some documentation, or you take the trouble to understand it yourself.<p>You seem to have a very low opinion of software architects, but believe me, you wouldn&#x27;t want to work on a 5-year old system where huge teams of developers have let loose and no one/team was responsible to ensure a cohesive, maintainable system.<p>Viewpoints are fantastic for communication purposes, and if you feel that the particular viewpoints shown don&#x27;t make much of a difference, I agree :). A student project is also not the ideal environment, but it is really valuable to know how to create them, considering the information needs of the audience (biz vs tech vs in-depth tech).

The best thing to do is be communicative, responsive and honest. Moving agile means all the above. Rule one is start small and go simple. Just spent three days on making something and I got stuck so I said fuck it, start small. So I need to build this tool that reads the output of another tool. Sadly it comes out in terminal with all kinds of custom format. Instead of parsing the full &quot;terminal output&quot; I receive, I start small by reading and getting whatever I need. Gradually I built up the &quot;reader/parser&quot; I need to from this report I was trying to parse. And I finished what I was hoping to finish.<p>> Also when you&#x27;re doing sole projects are there specific procedures you should follow and how do they differ from when you&#x27;re in a team?<p>It&#x27;s very subjective. I think if you are accustom to one way you do it that way more often. But I said in my example, I spent three days trying to go complex. That&#x27;s the failure of me, but it probably happen to everyone everytime because I (or we) think I was smart so I could solve this complex issue. The only rule I have when I do sole project is to define the scope of my project. I write down whatever I want to implement, what it does. Essentially building up a set of user stories for myself. But that&#x27;s also true for team project. You just can&#x27;t be sloppy and acting alone when you do team work... so when you work with others, get the user stories up and running, figure out the style you want to code in... they all matter.<p>Last thing: it&#x27;s easy to say, but it is damn hard to do it.

David Cameron is a politician whose party has a &quot;think of the children&quot; policy and has pledged to &quot;get tough&quot; and &quot;crack down&quot; on the availability of naughty material online.<p>The filtering &quot;policy&quot;, if you can even call it that, is basically just to urge ISPs to implement content filters of some kind. Not mandatory - not all ISPs have chosen to play along, but the big ones have due to the risk of reputational damage if not. Customers of ISPs with such filtering get the choice either to allow or disallow the content that their ISP&#x27;s chosen filtering solution thinks may be unacceptable. Some ISPs offer more comprehensive and flexible filters than others. E.g. Some will just block anything &quot;not for kids and nice families&quot;, others have a wide range of categories and options - just like corporate filters and technologies like WebSense offer. (e.g. Only block porn, allow sexual health, block humour and social networking sites, allow file sharing, etc etc etc)<p>There is NO &quot;Government&quot; filter. There is only a POLICY. Just a policy - barely even that. Certainly no legislation or law. Just a statement of intent, that &quot;we think people should do this&quot; and that&#x27;s all.<p>Fight censorship, absolutely. But be right about what you&#x27;re fighting.

There is often no way to get things taken off the list.<p>Sometimes things that should be filtered are not, and again there&#x27;s no way for users to report that.<p>The IWF list claims to have a tight focus on images of child sexual abuse and other pornography that is illegal in the UK.

It&#x27;s a God-given tool to a conservative government.<p>A lot of the things we take for granted now are actually far newer than we could imagine. Much of the outrage over the anti-abortion law in Spain was grounded in information that the younger generation can readily access over the Internet, but was far harder to obtain thirty or fourty years ago. Not just pro- and con- opinions from wannabe bloggers, but solid medical and physiological data, life experiences of women who had to go through it and philosophical debates.<p>The younger generation is a lot less meek than their parents and grandparents were, and a lot more politically unwieldy, <i>precisely</i> because of the ease with which they can obtain the knowledge they need in order to make a decision. Not an objective one, mind you; the Internet isn&#x27;t an oracle of impartial information. But a decision people are comfortable with. It&#x27;s hard <i>not</i> to bring up the 1984 mantra on this one.<p>Edit: it&#x27;s also worth pointing out something else, which I learned back when they didn&#x27;t filter porn where I live -- they filtered every single thing the government didn&#x27;t like (and the list was long) -- and they didn&#x27;t do it on the Internet (because there was no internet back then).<p>The Internet is big. It&#x27;s so mind-bogglingly big that I am astounded at it, every single day, and every time I think I probably know enough of it to be considered a well-traveled Internaut, something comes up and slaps me back to my senses.<p>Most underage porn viewers will simply stroll to the well-known websites. Xvideos, Redtube, whatever. There are websites where everyone knows they&#x27;re under heavy scrutiny from the law. Pedophilia, animal abuse and all that have very short lifespans there. There&#x27;s a lot of porn, but it&#x27;s well regulated, and generally scam-free.<p>By definition, a website filter will always be behind on the websites it filters. Because (doh!) a website first has to be live and to have visitors before it is filtered. Block the high-profile websites, and what happens?<p>Everyone -- including the underage viewers who don&#x27;t have the psychological maturity required to deal with a lot of the things people film these days -- flocks to the &quot;underground&quot;. Those, on the other hand, aren&#x27;t regulated. There&#x27;s every sort of crap to be found, from malware to child pornography, especially when augmented by the anonymity of tools like Tor (not that the tools are bad; they&#x27;re not, but that&#x27;s not true of their every use).

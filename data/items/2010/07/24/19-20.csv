Thats not good enough.  It has to be built-in, not optional, core to the language.  If you're working by yourself - you can write code in any language well.  In groups, that is NOT the case.  Writing Perl in groups requires rigorous code reviews and cooperation, and even then nightmares are hard to avoid.  Expressiveness has its downsides.  You cannot simply bring a Perl noob onto a project and not have him ruin it.  You CAN bring a new Rubyist onto a project and they can be productive.",1280001399

After all, if I believe ""There's more than one way to do it"", that applies to languages and communities, too. If a language whose community believes in only one way to do it makes you happy, use it. If you're like me and prefer having many options to express individual pieces of code however feels most appropriate for that specific situation(e.g., expressing a series of transformations on a list as either a list comprehension or a pipeline like series of feeds connecting higher-order functions), use a language that lets you do that. Neither is better for everyone. Nor is the programmer who prefers either type of language any better than the programmer who prefers the other.",1280001329

One caveat is often the audio and subtitles will vary (e.g. tu vs vous); I'm not sure why they do this.<p>Anyway, watch the movie, and pause it whenever something comes up that you don't understand.  You can also try watching English movies with French subtitles but it doesn't develop your French ear.  Also Google Translate is good practice.  Write something in one language and translate back and forth--it does a pretty decent job.  Writing in French will force you to use the proper grammer and vocabulary to make the translation come out OK.<p>I've in my mid 30's and have learned French fluently and advanced Spanish in the past 6 years.

Another measure of wealth disparity is the Gini index. We should forget GDP (or GDP with PPP) (or GNP) per capita as a metric. If I live in a country where there are only two people, one of who (not me) earns $1,000,000 per annum and the other (me) earns $10,000 and I'm told that the GDP per capita is $55,000 I'm not going to be impressed. But if the Gini index for my little two person country states that there is a massive imbalance in the distribution of wealth then I'll prefer that index.<p>What I'm trying to ask is: how long can this keep going on before some sort of underclass revolution kicks in. Or, are the poor in the US not _really_ absolutely poor (like rural farm-hand in China poor) but relatively poor (as in 36"" LCD TV instead on 50"").<p>You know what would be a cool hack?

There really is a big jump in complexity from using a few regexes in a program, and going full-on into a parser using lex/yacc (or your language's port, like javacc).<p>I think it's only been very recently that there's been a growth in parsing paradigms that are more amenable to inclusion as libraries with ease-of-use at least vaguely comparable to regexes.

It is perfectly possible to mark the time with a time marker then, but often this is not necessary to be understood. Relative time can be enough to be clear for the other. (Like ""I am short of bread. So I go to the market and buy some. Then I eat it."" is grammatically incorrect English, but easily understood, and a correct formulation in Dutch.)<p>Esperanto has past, present and future and has the possiblity to note the completeness of an action, but it's not obligatory as in English.<p>toki pona has no inflection and doesn't indicate time at all. If you want to indicate time, you end up using a complicated grammatical construction of causation. Mostly you just make a general statement or indicate time as something coming before or after something else.",1279998286

The solution is to have strong ethics rules to prevent it from happening.  You prohibit ex-legislators from working as lobbyists for a lengthy period of time after their term of service.  You make a rule, similar to the rules in place regarding reserve military service or FMLA, that guarantees that the person's old job is still there for them after they finish their term of service in the legislature.  You treat a promising a job or material wealth to a candidate or sitting legislator in exchange for their vote as a crime and prosecute lobbyists for doing it.<p>In one way, the system I've proposed has an inherent protection against this problem that our current system doesn't have.  Specifically, because all candidates are chosen by random lottery, an incumbent cannot run for a second term except in the exceedingly rare circumstance that they are chosen twice in a row by the lottery.  Therefore, the incumbent has no incentive to try to please any third party that helped them get elected in order to retain their support for a re-election campaign.",1279998234

When I bought a condo in central London, my contract with the association of all other owners in the building specifically forbade short-term sublets, and forbade any sublets without the written approval of the association.  When one condo owner started renting out on weekends through web advertising, the association had its lawyer bring that clause to the owner's attention and the practice was stopped immediately.  No law needed.  (BTW, these contracts for UK condo property take the form of ""leases"" for hundreds of years, which can be sold like other property.)",1279998203

Labeling is a start, but it's mostly a cultural change that we're not quite sure how to tackle on a large scale.<p>One problem is processed food. If you make food with fresh produce you will almost always be eating healthier and more nutritious food than if you eat processed foods. It's also much cheaper than eating out - just a time investment. Sadly, we're too busy to even enjoy good food and take the time to make good food. It's really sad that our culture misses one of the greatest aspects (IMHO) of life.<p>So what I'm saying is that properly labeling Vitamin Water is not necessarily the answer. Properly labeling potato chips, French fries, etc. only goes so far (it's common knowledge what's ""junk food"" and what isn't). The answer is figuring out a way to get people to value the food they eat, and ensuring that the demand for vitamins in flavored water or junk food don't exist - we should be getting our vitamins from fruits and vegetables to begin with, and only supplementing if necessary (otherwise, we miss out on the fibers in fruits and a whole host of other good stuff).<p>EDIT:<p>So the main problem is that we try to oversimplify nutrition. We say ""fat = bad, vitamins = good"" when we should emphasize balance.",1279998193

The best thing you can do is check what your DNS servers are, and where they are.<p>If your ISP is giving you, for example, one local server and one non-local server, do some sleuthing and figure out where their second local dns server is, and hard code your DNS to those servers (or, remove the server that isn't local).<p>In the earlier days of the Internet, you were encouraged to provide geographically diverse DNS servers.  But, what many operators did not understand is, that rule of thumb is for authoritative DNS hosting.<p>For DNS resolvers, you want those to be in the metro area that your internet connection terminates, and in that AS.

Fallacies:
#1 - It is automatically desirable to talk to the hot girl and the CEO, more so than to other people. It may be, it may not be, who knows. This is an implicit assumption in the article. 
#2 - That you therefore have to make an effort to talk to these people.<p>All three really are about the Ego and its trying to justify its existence by making itself important. Talking to hot girl / CEO - Ego gratification. Getting shot down - blow to the Ego. Fear of getting shot down - fear of the Ego losing its importance. If you looked at your own Ego as an entity all of its own, it is literally the fear of death.<p>Now with the hot girl situation you have two possible outcomes: Talk to hot girl; or avoid it. Both means you lose and both mean the ego wins. In talking to her, you ""made"" it and can feel proud; in avoiding, you've avoided being shot down and also ""made"" it. It's a lose-lose situation.<p>The best reaction that I know is to observe the ego forces within yourself - independent of your action.<p>Any time you feel superior, or inferior, to any other person, it's just the Ego talking. You can't stop this but you can observe it, realize it is so, and thereby overcome it. Personally when I have these moments I then just relax within myself and do what I like. I am happier and I am also meeting more interesting people.<p>""Stop thinking of people as who they are or what they represent"" - exactly.",1293679043

It is not and the differences between the countries in Scandinavia are substantial.

Another form might also allow replacing existing topics by PUTing to a /topic/<identifier> endpoint.

The estimate for emulating a brain is about 37 petaflops. The fastest supercomputer is currently China&#x27;s Tianhe-2, at nearly 34 petaflops. You&#x27;re certainly going to have more than 10% overhead for emulating a brain (more on this in a moment).<p>But beyond that, the brain is a <i>specialized</i> computing device, and at certain specialized tasks, it is currently unrivaled. However, this may largely be a matter of algorithms rather than raw power.<p>>Consider that the computational power necessary to emulate a human brain accurately is conjectured to be measured in petaflops.<p>Emulation requirements are an exceptionally poor indicator of computational power. Emulating an SNES <i>loosely</i> requires a CPU capable of around 350 MIPS (FLOPS don&#x27;t work for obvious reasons). Emulating an SNES <i>accurately</i> requires a CPU capable of over 50,000 MIPS. The CPU of an actual SNES does 1.5 MIPS. It has other components working in parallel, but we&#x27;d be generous to estimate 10 MIPS for the whole system.<p>Why the discrepancy? Well first off, there&#x27;s the overhead of simple translation. But more importantly, the SNES has several components working in parallel, and the timing of how these components interact is critical.<p>And that&#x27;s emulating hardware with a handful of components, designed by rational people. The brain has <i>massive</i> parallelism, and was created by a blind optimization process.<p>So even if whole brain emulation can really be accomplished with power around 37 petaflops, doing the actual <i>work</i> of a human brain (without emulating it) can be done with far, far less. The emulation overhead is probably orders of magnitude greater than that of an SNES, but if it were the <i>same</i>, we&#x27;d be looking at single-digit teraflops to implement a mind as powerful as a human&#x27;s. That&#x27;s achievable right now for a few thousand dollars.",1392550428

7247334,comment,7247064,7247064,5,0,billyjobob,,,"When an EU resident buys physical goods from a non-EU country the shipment is stopped at customs.  The customer must then pay VAT (plus an importation tax) on the value of the goods in order to have the shipment released.  There is no requirement that the <i>seller</i> of the goods pay VAT - how could the EU hope to enforce this across hundreds of foreign countries all with different legal system?  They simply police their own borders.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is how they apply this to digital goods, where there are no borders to police?  How do they even find out that digital goods are being imported?  If neither the buyer nor seller pay the VAT, how do they stop the transaction?  If the seller is located in Assfuckistan, then surely the transaction takes place in Assfuckistan, and unless Assfuckistan has signed a treaty with the EU to collect VAT on their behalf, why would their authorities interfere?",1392549607

If you&#x27;re living within your means and saving 30% of your income, you&#x27;re better off saving 30% of $150k than 30% of $40k. The cheap cost of living only applies if you&#x27;re living above your means, vacationing, or retiring.<p>- Cheap labor enables different ways of doing things. This includes transit like tuk-tuks and taxies, but Taiwan has another example: there are no parking meters. You just park, and a police office comes by every half hour or so and leaves a bill on your windshield (linked to your license plate).<p>- If everyone seems exceptionally friendly, that means you&#x27;re expected to be friendly too. My friend here has a neighbor who hates him because he doesn&#x27;t stop by to chat all the time like the other neighbors.<p>- English names of businesses, like the &quot;Nice Pharmacy&quot; example, are usually targeted to locals who don&#x27;t know much English.

As an example in freckle I use tags and the API to automatically export all entries every month/week updates the client through email reports or google sheet updates. It doesn&#x27;t look like that would be possible with ding.io yet (exkluding the manual csv download)?\nAlso the dashboard display priority seems a little off.<p>Money earned gets most space however is never the truth because of taxes, expenses etc. I rather use my accounting software for seeing my actual earnings.<p>Time logged is OK however Active projects for me isn&#x27;t really necessary information.<p>The activity stream and log time form should be of highest priority. Put the activity stream in focus with better one-click-filtering on clients/project/tags(?) would be great to quickly answer the clients questions on what I did. :-)<p>In summary I think the design is great and looking at features I think when comparing with freckle, which is relevant in my case, I feel like half the price equals half the functions.

So my answer is a little out of place, although I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any harm in keeping it here.</i><p>I disagree. I know that Java gets a lot of hate, here and in a lot of places, and I won&#x27;t deny that a lot of it is indeed very well deserved, but it&#x27;s far from being a &quot;legacy&quot; language. A quite large amount of software is being developed nowadays in Java, and in many cases, there are good reasons for that.<p>About the &quot;embarrassingly out of date&quot; part, I also think that&#x27;s too exagerated. Java was never intended to be a cutting edge language, but a reliable set of well-proven techniques. Java doesn&#x27;t want to be Haskell, doesn&#x27;t want to be Ruby, and doesn&#x27;t want to be Lisp; and explicitly so. Java has modest design goals; but it does fulfill them, which is why it&#x27;s such a successful language even if it&#x27;s not suitable for a lot of projects that you, myself or the rest of HN visitors may be interested in. But, on top of that, Java actually tries to incorporate functionality that has been successfully proven in different, and more innovative, lenguages (at an admittedly slow pace). Conservative, yes; out of date, I don&#x27;t think so.<p>I&#x27;m not really fond of Java, and if I had to choose, I think there&#x27;s probably no project for which I&#x27;d take it instead of some other language; however, its virtues are there.",1392548524

As it stands right now, users need to hope that someone will manage to ""crack"" the next BD+ revision (ie: building up the BD+ emulators to a point where they can pass the next set of checks) in order to back up or transcode their disks.  At times, the cracking community is further behind than a few months, making these movies useless outside of the standard player. I can't watch Blu-ray movies on my MacBook or iPhone at all without ripping them, one of the reasons I haven't bought a single BR disc to own.<p>If users knew that a key release is coming on a set date, it would remove a lot of the motivation for people to work on cracking BD+.",1263265187

If not, that might be a good idea.<p>Still, with 26 portfolio companies, he's claiming 8-ish concurrent lawsuit threats... that's alarming.

Bonus points for making the number of nexts as low as possible.)<p>- Pick something that results in visually impressive output rather than a blank page.  See Balsamiq for inspiration here -- they start you with a mockup in progress that demonstrates most of the highlights of the software.<p>- Ever seen Firefly?  I really like how they use the word ""shiny"".  Ideally, your defaults should show the shiny in your app.  In Hollywood they have a saying: make sure your budget makes it onto the screen.  In B2C apps, make sure the stuff you did all the work on makes it into the user experience most of your users will see.<p>- Assume your user is a novice at both your software and the problem domain until you have evidence otherwise.  A lot of people ask the user ""Hey, are you a novice?""  That is one way to do things, but it makes your core workflow one stage longer and every stage costs you conversion.  I prefer ""Assume they are and give them a discrete 'skip ahead' button"" or ""Assume they are and watch them for evidence that they are not"".<p>- If your app is supposed to make the user feel like they just killed an effing lion, then your default settings better have a lion bound and gagged sitting under a forty-ton weight suspended by a weak string which passes through an open pair of scissors next to a sign saying ""Snip this.""<p>- (Do this if nothing else.)  Track actual usage of the app and modify your defaults based on actual usage.  Bonus points if you can do it dynamically, if that makes sense for your app.  For example, if you pick A as the default and 25% of your users go out of their way to change it to B, then that probably should have been B.  (You can split test and see how many people would have changed it to A if it had defaulted to B.)",1263263061

The average T1 costs around $250/month, less if you're savvy. You need a physical location, because colo rates are still ridiculous IMO, so ... say another $2,000 / month, which is plenty for a small office in a warehouse district somewhere.<p>Even after lots of other goodies, you'd still have, let's say, $10,000 <i>a month</i> to spend on ... what? More machines? A bigger generator? Huge parties?<p>I don't think that ""the cloud"" is appropriate for certain applications -- and theirs would be one of them -- where you have large amounts of persistent data and large, sustained, ongoing bandwidth requirements.<p>Realize that, for what Amazon charges currently, you can buy an equivalent 1TB disk drive every single month. (Their monthly charges for storage alone, not including bandwidth, work out to a little more than the cost-per-GB for a good quality terabyte disk at current prices.)",1263262755

An attempt at changing clear, intention-revealing synchronous code to work asynchronously frequently results in ugly, hard-to-follow callback hell.<p>This is true. There's some merit to the argument that you should plan for your IO code to be asynchronous from the beginning and structure your program that way.<p>Havoc Pennington had a nice post about that: <a href=""http://log.ometer.com/2008-09.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://log.ometer.com/2008-09.html</a><p>""Using async APIs is not premature optimization, it's correct design.""<p>Some languages provide constructs that make it cleaner to write asynchronous code in a way that looks more natural.<p>F# has an async monad for this purpose.

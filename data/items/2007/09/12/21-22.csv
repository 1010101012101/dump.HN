54031,comment,53834,53885,0,0,tx,,,"Yea... and then when you're finally <i>know</i> what to do, you're held back by bottlenecks and deficits of your editor/IDE. Doing ""context switch"" on your brain, switching from the problem you're programming to ""how the heck do I tell it to stop auto-indenting 8char tabs?!"" is frustrating. It's slowing you down. Things get only worse when you're dealing with many files.<p>It's not the ""typing time"" that good editors save you, it's the ""thinking time"" they save since you're not forced to think much about them. <p>When I was forced to switch from Visual Studio 6 to VS2003, my productivity really suffered. Things did not work the way I wanted and I kept cold-rebooting my brain after every little interruption. Now I'm switching to vim and while it may not be as ""fast"" for certain tasks, its consistency and transparency makes me forget it's there. Besides, by not relying on arrow keys, pageup/down, del/ins and so on, vim allows me to be equally productive on unknown keyboards, especially on laptops, easily switching computers, which I happen to do quite often.\n",1189633899

You could put the exact same OS out as open source and it would remain in the realm of the power-user/hobbyist. ",1189633522
54029,comment,53834,54010,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Depends.  Smart, flexible people can get the job done with any tool <i>as long as that tool is ""good enough""</i>.  However, a bad tool will cripple even a good programmer.<p>The Emacs/vi/IntelliJ/Eclipse/Netbeans/Kate/jEdit/TextPad debate is meaningless, because all the above choices are ""good enough"".  However, a decent programmer's productivity will be severely hampered by Notepad.  Similarly, the Rails/Django/Pylons debate is pointless, but choosing JSF can easily kill your project.",1189633336

54021,comment,53985,53985,0,0,aston,,,"Puzzles are fun, but really not the way to judge a person.<p>If I were interviewing for a person and wanted to test for technical know how, I'd just ask them how they think ___ works (where the blank is some popular, semi-related product), and use that as a spring board to talk with them for the next hour about stuff. You get a good sense for the type of knowledge and comfort people have for material that's actually relevant to the job at hand, and on top of that you can suss out things like how well you'd work with them.",1189632529

How much would that suck. Good luck giving and receiving objective advice in a situation like that. If you're not trying to form a community it doesn't matter.

Once you know and understand the solution to a problem or a puzzle, what's the point (with respect to the company that is hiring) in candidate getting lucky in the interview and answering that question?<p>Usually people say that solution is not the important thing for a question but the process of getting to a correct or wrong solution is important. Some times interviewers ignore this fact.<p>Instead of puzzles or problems which may surprise some candidates, how about American Idol auditions style interviews. For example, you ask a candidate (for programming job) to design/implement/test some small problem giving the full requirements or simulating changing requirements. Will this process help select a right candidate?",1189631872

At 300% plus debt to income, they&#x27;re basically the most indebted households on earth. Debt per adult is 4th highest in the world [2].

8978883,comment,8978509,8978762,0,0,karmacondon,,,"The original blogosphere concept may be fading, but I don&#x27;t think that bloggers or readers are suffering because of it. In a sense individual bloggers are like AP reporters and aggregators are the new newspapers. Dozens of AP stories are filed every day and local newspapers pick and choose which ones to include in each edition. The major difference between the traditional newspaper model and link aggregators is that we can easily see all stories filed by an individual blogger, whether they get picked up by our &quot;hometown&quot; paper or not[0]. Sharing a link to a blog post on facebook will never replace quality journalism of course, but I think we&#x27;ve come full circle back to this model because it works. Most people don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to follow a multitude of different blogs or maintain their own. They just want news and opinion selected for them, by trained editors or a community, and the ability to comment on those stories.<p>An open exchange of long form ideas between a network of people who each run their own blog has an important place in internet culture, but it doesn&#x27;t scale very well. It was a golden age, for a time, but the aggregation model as the potential to open those ideas up to a much broader range of people.<p>[0] I&#x27;m actually not sure if the AP allows people to easily &quot;follow&quot; all stories filed by specific reporters, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it.",1422755872

If we take the one on Wikipedia as canon it isn&#x27;t the same as this.<p>In particular, a Turing Machine is a model while both Brainfuck and Groot are languages. It&#x27;s easy to see how each of these languages is directly translated into a Turing Machine model (providing them a choice of semantics). Indeed, due to their isomorphism we need only translate one of them to have a faithful translation of the other &quot;for free&quot;.<p>Better yet, Brainfuck and Groot both have a privileged semantic model which is more or less identically a Turing Machine (except Brainfuck merely specifies that the tape is at least 30,000 bytes long and Groot mentions site not at all while Turing Machines are explicitly infinite).<p>So, they&#x27;re really closely related to a Turing Machine but honestly separate things more closely related to one another (via isomorphism) than to TMs directly (via semantic mapping).",1422755765

You can&#x27;t use trademarks to prevent a person describing something.

Reid did this with me. We agreed I was going to make judgment calls on a range of issues on his behalf without checking with him. He told me, “In order to move fast, I expect you’ll make some foot faults. I’m okay with an error rate of 10-20% — times when I would have made a different decision in a given situation – if it means you can move fast.” I felt empowered to make decisions with this ratio in mind—and it was incredibly liberating.&quot;&quot;<p>-<p>> 2. The best way to get a powerful person’s attention: offer to help them.<p>This is entirely consistent with what Sheryl Sandberg said at HBS&#x27;s commencement in 2012. [1]<p>&quot;When I was first at Facebook, a woman named Lori Goler, a 1997 graduate of HBS, was working in marketing at eBay and I knew her kind of socially. And she called me and said, I want to talk with you about coming to work with you at Facebook. So I thought about calling you, she said, and telling you all the things I’m good at and all the things I like to do. But I figured that everyone is doing that. So instead I want to know what’s your biggest problem and how can I solve it. My jaw hit the floor. I’d hired thousands of people up to that point in my career, but no one had ever said anything like that. I had never said anything like that. Job searches are always about the job searcher, but not in Laurie’s case. I said, you’re hired. My biggest problem is recruiting and you can solve it.&quot;<p>-<p>> &quot;At PayPal, one cultural trait was: “Let the best idea win.” No answer or idea at PayPal would be taken at face value. Instead, the idea’s proprietor had to argue vigorously and withstand critiques from colleagues. The upside: analytical rigor tends to produce better ideas than “this is the way it’s always been done” or “the CEO said so.” The downside: a confrontational interpersonal culture can stress relationships at work and undermine possible collaboration. Moreover, this cultural undercurrent was effectively “anti-experience”: it was a harder place for experienced people to operate because they had to re-prove themselves.&quot;&quot;<p>This reminds me of Julie Zhuo&#x27;s writing about design being intentional and purposeful.

For a young person, a 0.1% chance of death is years&#x27; worth of death risk. However, I think there&#x27;s a way to &quot;trick&quot; people into a result like this. Say that Pill A has a 99.9% chance of delivering a cure, and Pill B has a 100% chance of curing them. First, &quot;99.9%&quot; sounds very good already, and &quot;100%&quot; sets off our bullshit detectors because almost nothing in medicine <i>always</i> works. The 99.9 figure is more precise and therefore more impressive.<p>Furthermore, there&#x27;s a difference between (a) the pill itself kills in 0.1% of chances vs. (b) it&#x27;s 99.9% efficacious. In (b), you can take the cheap medicine and try the expensive one if the cheap one does work. As for (a), that&#x27;s not something we really face because no drug that kills 0.1% of patients at normal doses would be on the market. If it were used at all, it&#x27;d be restricted to hospitals and used only when the disease was severe enough to merit it (e.g. cancer drugs).<p><i>The prime candidates for entrepreneurial ventures are actually people in their 30s and 40s. Their startups are less likely to fail and reasonably so. They have more experience than people in their 20s and more drive than people in their 50s.</i><p>Adverse selection. Most 50+ who have their shit together don&#x27;t want to deal with VCs and their bullshit. There are plenty of driven, 50+ year old entrepreneurs, but they&#x27;re not interested in VC. Also, they aren&#x27;t interested in get-big-or-die gambits <i>in general</i> because getting back into the careers they left, at that age, is just much harder.<p><i>This suggests that corporations have a great deal to make by offering entrepreneurial opportunities to their employees.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that the concept of an &quot;intrapreneur&quot;-- except at a small number of companies like Valve (which only has a few hundred employees)-- has legs. Would Google or Microsoft or Citibank allow it if everyone wanted to be an &quot;intrapreneur&quot;?<p>While the intrapreneur path will involve a lower risk of financial loss (because it requires no capital investment, except opportunity cost in the willingness to take a lower salary and a more interesting job) it probably has a higher per-month job-loss risk. Employees can avoid behaviors that will make them enemies. They can choose not to give a fuck when it isn&#x27;t their turn to give a fuck. Intrapreneurs don&#x27;t have that liberty. They have to fight battles, work hard enough that they lose social polish, and (if their managers aren&#x27;t supportive) navigate a conflict of interest between their personal project and their assigned work. They can easily turn into overperformers and get themselves fired. Moreover, I don&#x27;t think that the sociological issues that are in play here are going to go away easily.<p>None of this refutes the title itself, as presented:<p><i>Why Corporations Could Get Higher Returns Than VCs</i><p>In fact, they already do.

Getting paid in advance. Whether it&#x27;s 10%, 30%, 50% or 100%. You should work your ass off for your customers. But if they haven&#x27;t paid you, they aren&#x27;t really a customer, are they?<p>If you didn&#x27;t get any upfront payment, ask for something once you have any deliverable to show. Show proof of work and a reasonable client should be willing to send money your way. Worried about getting paid? Establish that they will pay as soon as possible.<p>Also, a contract that holds up in court and results in a judgement in your favor is no guarantee of payment. A judgement means you can send a debt to collections.

Approach this from their point of view, find out what they&#x27;re willing to pay, not the minimum you&#x27;re willing to charge.<p>Start out high. Charge a rate that seems too high. If the customer says &quot;no&quot; find out why. It may not be the price, but some other concern.

The psychologist will help you sort out emotional and stress problems in the short, medium and long term.<p>After getting better on the short term you&#x27;ll be able to work out the areas in your life that need attention.<p>Hope you pull through. Burnouts are just horrendous, don&#x27;t let yours become crippling depression.",1422752926

Yea, I tried all the stuff they recommended, but I can&#x27;t access the videos.  I contacted Google, but they didn&#x27;t have a clue, and told me to go to the \nboards.  It was a very polite email.  (I used Youtube as a personal diary of things I need to do, or projects that needed further work.  One video had a product brand name in it and gained attention.  I never thought they would be kidnaped?  They are boring videos, but there&#x27;s one I want off\nfor multiple reasons).",1422752911

8978723,comment,8978184,8978184,0,0,kephra,,,"Copyright: You own the copyright by default, and only license further use of your work. This license can be very permissive, e.g. MIT, BSD, viral like GPL, proprietary, or even insane. Its your choice, and one of the questions you should decide before talking to a customer. E.g. I prefer double license GPL+proprietary for my work. But miles may vary.<p>Contract: The most important points in the contract are naming stepstones, milestones, budget, payment at each milestone, payment terms. An agreement is only good, as long as you agree. It often becomes toilet paper if disputed, especially as lawsuits might be more expensive then the value of the contract, and as contracts are difficult to enforce over international borders for a freelancer. So there is no need to pay a lawyer to create a legal bullet proof contract, as you can not enforce it anyway. Better write one that a human understand. Thats not more complicated then selling your car. One of my &quot;tricks&quot; is to offer 2% discount, if payment is within 7 days after invoice. Any customer who can count money, and has no big cashflow problem will pay instant. Drop those who are late payers. They are often problem customers in other terms also.<p>Time vs money, 1st: The curse of any coder are infinite ideas vs. limited lifetime to execute them. Applying the law of diminishing returns on this, and new ideas receive a negative value. The same sooner or later shadows over the value of money, as people start to throw more money at you to solve their problems, then you ever need.<p>Time vs money, 2nd: I advise against selling time for money at all. Time for money does not scale, as you have only a limited lifetime, but there is unlimited money around. Selling time for money is typical for employed workers, but a professional should sell solutions for money.<p>Picking customers: Often customers pick you. You are lucky, you got your first client. Do a good job, and he will tell others. At first you will likely take any job that comes. But take care, that there are problem customers, who will leach your time, never pay the full amount, and claim they want more work for the money you agreed. Drop them, to concentrate on good customers.<p>Pick the good customers and convince them to sign a maintenance contract. I&#x27;m old and saturated now, have a semi passive income from maintenance contracts, and I&#x27;m dropping more then 80% of potential customers, often just because of a gut feeling during the first talks, before signing any paper. Signing a NDA is often the end of the talk, as ideas have a negative value for me.<p>Build a portfolio of skills where you are better then the average, as you already know the tools or the topic. You can offer fixed prices once you have this tools, skills, and knowledge. Fixed prices to solve problem will make much more money then selling time for money, as the value of the problem is much higher then the value of a contractor. There are basically two types of problems: Problems where you reduce the running cost of something, and problems where you increase sales. Estimate how much a solution is worth within a year, and ask for a good fraction of this for the prototype, and a smaller fraction for the maintenance contract.",1422752716

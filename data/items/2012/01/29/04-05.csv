If I get rid of it (I should have done that earlier) and move the buttons around, they start looking really similar[1]. (I also got rid of the home and bookmark buttons which I don't use either.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tikhon/browsers1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tikhon/browsers1.png</a><p>On the other hand, Firefox looks more native--for example, it has the same reload button (but not the forward/backwards buttons, for some reason) as KDE programs.<p>Also, unlike Chrome, it is pretty trivial to turn off the url bar, saving even more space.<p>However, my real point is that getting a fairly minimal firefox/chrome (although not as minimal as the example alexis-d gives) on Linux is easy and can, in fact, be done even without any extensions. You could even use KDE's tabbed windows and eschew Firefox-specific tabs entirely, but turning the tabs off in Firefox may require an extension.<p>Of course, a meta-point is that tinkering around with my window manager is fun :)",1327813134

There are several frameworks which make writing server-side code easy and have very good performance; the two most popular ones seems to be Snap[1] and Yesod[2].

Unlike Dropbox, MegaUpload was shady to begin with, and with a lot more emphasis on public file sharing. But the possibility of individual files being taken down is pretty real. Dropbox probably does it all the time already, otherwise they'd be in trouble with DMCA.<p>Now, whether they will only delete your online copy, or whether they will let the deletion propagate to your local copy, is totally up to Dropbox.

My group does custom web apps, and we have a division that does SEO analytic etc. The do offer packages for clients that need sites, and for almost every case a theme fits the bill.

As an alternative to post categories, tags or hashtags would go a long way to solving the problem.<p>Tag your content, and let your subscribers filter by tag. To create the filter, tag your circles to give them context, and when someone in a circle makes a post with a matching tag, show the post, otherwise suppress it.<p>So for example, I tag my Functional Programming circle with #Haskell #Ocaml #Scala #MapReduce #Lisp #Clojure #Python, and only posts with at least one of those tags are shown in my feed. Posts in that circle tagged with #VacationPictures #DinnerPictures and the like are suppressed.<p>Do tagging the way StackOverflow does  when you start typing a tag for a post, show all the related ones, let you click to select pre-existing tags. That should keep the number of slightly-differently-spelled tags to a minimum.<p>This and similar schemes have been repeatedly suggested since G+ went live. They added hashtags, hashtag search, and hashtag autocomplete, but not the killer app  hashtag filter  yet.  The tagging infrastructure is all there, I don't know what the holdup is.  Even if this is just a 90% solution, it's still infinitely better than the current state of G+.<p>Makes you wonder, do they use their own product in the same way their audience does?

In other words, the free digital copy serves as a kind of crippled demo of the real thing -- like trial versions of software.<p>However, in 5-10 years, tablets and ebook readers will become more popular and many more people will be able to read those free digital copies on devices which provide a reading experience that rivals that of printed books. (This is already possible on iPads and Kindles, but these devices are not widespread yet.) We'll see how many people want to buy Mr Coelho's printed books when they are able to get almost the same experience for free on TPB.<p>With a free digital alternative, the only people who buy something from Coelho will be those who do it out of sheer gratitude. If you are a Paulo Coelho, you can survive on that. Extremely popular writers will do fine regardless of piracy -- kind of like Facebook is doing fine despite the lack of a serious business model due to the sheer number of users. For less popular authors, the ""free digital giveaway"" strategy won't work. Coelho doesn't see that, maybe because he is assuming that every writer can become a Coelho if only they give their stuff away for free.<p>As a case in point, we already know Coelho's strategy (give away digital version, charge for physical version) does not work for short-form content. Just look at the newspapers. They're doing the exact same thing: giving away their stuff for free online and asking people to subscribe to the physical version for a fee. Not many takers, unfortunately, as the free online version is ""good enough"".<p>Needless to say, I don't see this approach working for movies, music and software, either.

I'm afraid it also raises more questions for me (I probably need to go study CoffeeScript some more). BTW, the text I added is actually from the first example - the simplest:<p><pre><code>  await $.getJSON url, defer json\n</code></pre>\nIs the following right? Syntactically, ""defer json"" is an argument to the function ""$.getJSON"". So you could write it like this:<p><pre><code>  await $.getJSON( url, defer(json) )\n</code></pre>\nThe code we are waiting for is the ""$.getJSON"" call. That code indicates that it is finished by calling <i>the function returned by defer</i>.<p>But what does <i>the function returned by defer</i> do?  It looks like it (somehow) sets its argument to the result... so in the above example, ""json"" (somehow) gets the result of the call; in your example, ""x"" (somehow) gets a value. I'm guessing it's some convenient compiler magic that ICS does, and not an issue of CoffeeScript syntax.<p>An upshot of this is you can't give defer any old argument (e.g. a numerical value) - it has to be a variable that is capable of being set.<p>Also, who is the ""callee""?  A ""callee"" is a function that is called... Oh, does it mean (eg) ""$.getJSON"" is a callee, and it calls the callback function given to it (in the jQuery docs, it's notated as ""<i>success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)</i>""; here, that <i>success</i> function is <i>the function returned by defer</i>). I guess, given the purpose of ICS, there will always be a callee in the block - but it seems to me that, syntactically, you could just directly call <i>the function returned by defer</i>.  Ah... but (I bet) part of the compiler magic is that you are only allowed to call <i>the function returned by defer</i> from within another function - this is because the result of that other function is needed in order to set the argument of defer to it. Whew.<p>One last thing: the description talks about ""deferrals"" begin ""fulfilled"", but it doesn't say where these defarrals come from. Now, I think they are created by calling <i>defer</i>.<p>Hmmm.... it's probably better for me to think about this in terms of lisp macros, instead of C calls, as macros allow you to do weird source code transformations, like setting the value of a variable given as an ""argument"". i.e. ICS  is a macro.",1327809955

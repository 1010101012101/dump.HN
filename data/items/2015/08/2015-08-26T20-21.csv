So its users, unlike with any national currency, have to take what they are given, without ever being able to have a say in how the currency is run.<p>This is antidemocratic at its core, of course, but the near-ubiquitous response I get is, &quot;sure it&#x27;s democratic, you just need to fork it and then persuade 51% of the network to use your fork,&quot; and occasionally someone comes out and says &quot;people aren&#x27;t fit to make economic decisions, it&#x27;s right that Bitcoin makes those decisions for them.&quot;<p>Never has a single Bitcoin advocate ever said, &quot;you&#x27;re right, there should be some method in place for Bitcoin users to have a say in how it operates.&quot;  Not once.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen any other community so willing to either take power (for those who think of themselves as the techno-elite) or give it away (for those who recognize they aren&#x27;t).<p>It reminds me of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s running gag about how the people of Ankh-Morpork want kings back.",1440622346

<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6209"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6209</a><p>From the abstract:  Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not.<p>The Cat detection thing was just a side product of learning to identify features of things in an unsupervised manner, but the news outlets locked on to that with titles such as &quot;How Many Computers to Identify a Cat? 16,000&quot; in NY Times.<p>Wasn&#x27;t it amazing that they could distill the concept of cat from images with no help from external labels (human intervention)? They missed the core of the discovery by not understanding that.<p>The deep learning method is an unsupervised way to process raw input and transform it into useable features. This used to be done by a combination of domain knowledge and supervised training, but they could build an automated way to extract relevant features from images.<p>This opened the window for hope that one day neural networks will be easily applied to any new domain if there is sufficient raw data to build a deep network for it. In the past there was a need for a large investment in human based data labeling and how to extract the best features from raw data (also described as voodoo magic by the same researchers - it was hard, it was domain locked and expensive).",1440622144

It isn&#x27;t all roses and sunshine for the employee, essentially you will be stuck working for them, and if you ever get fired you have to find a new employer very quickly or risk getting deported. Even if you do keep your job it is extremely difficult to convert it to residence (I believe that requires costly employee sponsorship too).<p>While moving to the US is a great opportunity, it is only a great opportunity if you can escape the shackles of H1-B and work for whoever you want, or do your own startup.<p>So all I am getting at is, if you move to the US don&#x27;t expect to be doing a startup again for at least ten years, unless you move back to India. It is unlikely many existing startups can bring on a H1-B categorised employee, and you definitely cannot start your own startup without being deported.<p>There are a few interesting articles on this topic....",1440622028

If your founders lied in a written statement they will be liable for even more. In general if your founder lies to you and you have proof and the company goes big he is in trouble. Your lawyers will need to see all paperwork you signed in such case, watch out for sketchy terms you might be asked to sign later on. It is possible that crappy founders will try to erase all prior liability at some time when the company is about to make it big. In fact the company lawyers always go back and check everything the founders signed before a big deal to avoid any unforeseen liability.<p>You have to judge if your founders act in good faith or they are taking every opportunity to put you at disadvantage.

Therefore even in the most superficial analysis 80% of the money will be wasted on metrics and TPS reports and consultants.  The reality of course is deadwood can cause much more damage than a front line instructor, lets say 2x as much, so of the $100M at least $90M would be wasted on deadwood and only $10M would get to the instructors.<p>$10M to the instructors sounds helpful, but its a big district so it divides out to only $10K or so per instructor.  Figure a substantial portion of that will be lost in paperwork and corruption (4 out of 5 employees exist to get in the way...) so you only get $5K per teacher effective.<p>Assuming money equaled results, $5K isn&#x27;t much.  A math teacher could buy 50 brand new TI calculators, assuming buying brand new calculators increased student results, which they probably don&#x27;t.  Or about ten ipads, so the ten worst troublemakers could play angry birds and get out of the way of the rest of the class.  Or $5K is about two sets of new overpriced textbooks for newark&#x27;s very large class sizes.  Again assuming any of those expenses give results anywhere but the product sellers bottom lines...

There is a bootstrapping program, GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent, buried deeply in a user’s home

neither requests permission to modify your system nor notifies you when it does. (2) Detailed
analysis of this bootstrapping program cannot reveal what it may do because actual actions (via
programs & scripts in this case) are only received from the Internet at runtime. (3) A critical
executable (one you trust with your passwords for many important network services) will be
modified.<p>The paper then goes on to argue that this is a useful test case for people trying to detect when malware has modified their system, and what it has modified.<p>The paper does not discuss the security strengths or flaws of Chromium itself --- that discussion is completely tangential to the paper.",1440621756

For example, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m setting up a business trip. I like hotels that are within 1 mile of the conference center, and they have to be at least 3.5 stars and up. Provided they meet those criteria, the cheapest option is acceptable. I also need a plane flight that has no more than 1 layover, and that layover cannot last longer than 90 minutes or less than 45. I am willing to pay up to 25% more for a nonstop flight. The flight must arrive the day before the conference, but it can depart on the day the conference ends.<p>Setting up those criteria for each individual search would be irritating and a waste of effort, as they don&#x27;t change from trip to trip. However, if I could say something like &quot;Let me tell you about my criteria for choosing a location for a business trip.&quot;, and then go into detail once, that might work. Hell, I&#x27;d be perfectly happy setting up the details on a website. Then, the next time I said &quot;I need to set up a business trip&quot;, all it would need to ask is the conference center and the dates of the conference.<p>Until it supports these kinds of detailed requests, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to use these kinds of services in the way they market them - you&#x27;ll end up using it in the same limited way you could use Siri. For example, if you&#x27;ve already decided what restaurant you want, you might say &quot;Make me a reservation at Dorsia for 7:30 this evening&quot; instead of the examples you provided.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1440621326

Define an visible and achievable target for this, rather than starting to implement an open-ended project that you won&#x27;t finish in the time.<p>At the end of this, if everything goes well and you like the company, negotiate terms for the full-time role. This will be the right time to do it: You will be in a strong position having demonstrated your skills up close and produced something of value to the company.

10125833,comment,10121859,10124653,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"Yes, I think this is the essence of the problem: the PTO and the courts have a very hard time distinguishing a nonobvious invention from an easy problem that merely happens to have been solved for the first time (as far as the PTO can tell).<p>I have occasionally seen a software patent with an idea that was not obvious at least to me, but I haven&#x27;t seen many of them.  Most have been as you describe: once the requirements are understood, there is no difficulty designing a system to satisfy them.  It&#x27;s just that (again, as far as the PTO can tell) nobody has come across that particular set of requirements before.<p>I think that in order to litigate a patent, the patentee should be required to provide evidence that their invention was nonobvious.  The PTO is poorly equipped and structured to do a good job filtering out obvious &quot;inventions&quot; (for example, examiners have no incentives to do so); and yet, as things stand, the courts defer to the PTO on this question.  I think the rules should be changed so the court has to be persuaded of the nonobviousness of the patent before the suit can proceed.  That would be a potentially adversarial proceeding itself, in that the defendant would be allowed to argue that the invention is obvious, but the primary burden of proof would be on the patentee.<p>One could argue that this would put on the court a job that should belong to the PTO, and that argument has some merit, but here&#x27;s a counterargument.  It&#x27;s often hard to tell, when a patent application is filed, how much the potential patent will be worth.  Delaying part of the effort involved in evaluating the patent until such a time that the patentee has actually decided to litigate makes some economic sense.  More to the point, it is often easier to show nonobviousness once some time has passed.  One of the Graham factors [0] that can be used as evidence of nonobviousness is commercial success of a product based on the invention.  Such success can&#x27;t have occurred yet at the time the patent application is filed.<p>The change I am proposing would constitute a massive shift in the balance of power between patentees and alleged infringers, and a lot of oxen would be gored; I&#x27;m well aware of that.  A lot of companies would see the putative value of their patent portfolios drop precipitously.  Against that, they would have to worry a lot less about being sued.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in your take on this, as you&#x27;ve been inside the system a lot more than I have.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_v._John_Deere_Co.#The_Patent_Act_of_1952"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_v._John_Deere_Co.#The_P...</a>",1440621198

Last year before she went on maternity leave she was placed on a pip as well and remained on a PIP status until two weeks she returned from ML, 5 months later. A PIP is intimidating, yes, but they are structured to identify where you need immediate improvement. I know she didn&#x27;t feel any pressure to leave or animosity towards her and granted her case is totally different, the working culture here has a big emphasis on retaining as many Google employees as possible and helping them grow, whether that&#x27;s through uplifting or criticism. My suggestion would be to escalate it. I know personally that that type of behavior or even intentions are rare and extremely frowned upon. Our benefits teams did a great job making sure she was set up for maternity leave and even personally delivered our baby bonus to us while still at the hospital. (which isn&#x27;t typical, I had some issues with her identity being stolen)  Hell, one of our company motos is simply &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot;.<p>P.S after my wife&#x27;s PIP, it was determined that her skills could be be utilized on a different team, so she was given an opportunity that she continues to excel in today.

Most commercial startups, including Tri Alpha, are pursuing ultradense plasma. It&#x27;s not surprising: ultradense plasma devices are smaller, thus cheaper to experiment with, but also more speculative/dependent on poorly-understood physics, making them a better fit for the private sector. Polywells on the other hand have some decent theoretical backing and the main trouble is trying to build one large enough -- IIRC, Bussard obtained some results which, if extrapolated, imply net power in a $100M device.",1440619543

10125622,comment,10118109,10125057,0,0,acqq,,,">  If you&#x27;re talking about &quot;seeing&quot; or &quot;attention,&quot; you&#x27;re already speaking in concepts that presume the existence of consciousness.<p>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t clear enough. The world around us (and animals) is projected in our (and animal&#x27;s) neurological system as some kind of the model. The question is just if the model is such that favors the representation of the uniqueness of the organism or not. I claim that there&#x27;s evolutionary advantage in producing a system (hardware and software) where organism cares for itself and where the model is so formed that &quot;me&quot; is in the center, to the level that &quot;me&quot; is &quot;conscious&quot; in the sense, processing the stimuli as much that the dog understands that the paw is &quot;his paw&quot; and that it&#x27;s dangerous to put the paw in the fire and up to the level of you and me considering &quot;us&quot; &quot;us&quot; and being able to talk about it. Therefore we&#x27;re not so much different from the rest of the animals.<p>>  I&#x27;m not sure this gives us a useful framework to know when any computational process we have created does indeed have &quot;consciousness,&quot;<p>I&#x27;d still like to know how you can define consciousness in a way that it doesn&#x27;t sound religious. If you can&#x27;t, then of course we can&#x27;t progress in our discussion.<p>Let me give you very &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;simplified&quot; view of the &quot;free will&quot; subject. I see it as a purely religious construct, based on the following history: initially, gods weren&#x27;t &quot;almighty and omnipresent.&quot; If you&#x27;ve read ancient Greek literature, there are such gems like &quot;Zeus was at that moment in Egypt so he wasn&#x27;t there when the soldiers he supported lost.&quot; If you&#x27;ve read Bible, the oldest myths (I mean, stories in the Bible) are actually based on such concept of god(s). Then the theology &quot;theory&quot; grew more demanding, postulating the &quot;almighty omnipresent&quot; but also the &quot;loving&quot; god. Which made the myths (stories) much absurder than they were as they were written. How can almighty loving god produce the world and then see that it&#x27;s bad, so that it has to send the flood to destroy it? It&#x27;s either not almighty or not loving etc. As a rescue, the priests invented the concept of &quot;free will&quot; as in &quot;once god creates humans, they have their own free will (which god can&#x27;t control!?) and they do what they do so then they get to deserve to suffer, go to hell and all that nice stuff.&quot; Most of the &quot;modern&quot; theological concepts are constructed as an attempt to make less absurd the whole &quot;body of work.&quot; A kind of &quot;justification by obscurity&quot; which obviously works for believers, giving them easy covertly nonsensical sentences to answer the &quot;hard questions&quot; others would give them.<p>In reality, we just have what user jonsen formulates here as &quot;the purpose of consciousness is to keep its organism viable. It does that by collecting an essence of past and from that predict an essence of the future.&quot;<p>Now you ask about the &quot;framework to know when any computational process we have created does indeed have &quot;consciousness.&quot;&quot; It depends on the definition of he consciousness, but that definition can&#x27;t involve gods and &quot;nonphysical entities.&quot; As soon as that is clear we can measure the &quot;consciousness as what we observe in a dog&quot; or the &quot;consciousness as what we observe in a six months kid,&quot; the &quot;consciousness as what we observe in a twenty years old healthy human&quot; and the &quot;consciousness as what we observe in 80 years old human with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease which progressed this much.&quot;<p>Note that neurologists as the part of their daily routine have to evaluate the level of consciousness in their patients. It&#x27;s very instructive to read just some examples of he cases they work with.<p>When we&#x27;re there, do you think that a human with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease which progressed so much that he can&#x27;t remember anybody from his life or what he did just 15 seconds ago has a &quot;soul?&quot; (a lot of healthy animals remember for months different things, or if you talk with the owners of pets, you&#x27;ll hear that there are animals which have traumas and a lot of the psychological symptoms you&#x27;d just associate with humans). So back to the patient, do you consider him &quot;conscious?&quot; If not, at which point did he lost his consciousness which you equate with soul? If yes, where is he different from some good Perl script? There is no &quot;single unique unchangeable&quot; consciousness, there are just different levels of functioning of the model I mention at the start. Of course, when you die, the model completely stops functioning as it needs both the hardware and the software, the brain and the body as the hardware and all these nice electrical impulses and chemical reactions in the living organisms as the software. There&#x27;s no such thing as the &quot;agency of the nonphysical entity&quot; there.",1440619309

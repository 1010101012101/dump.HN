1225763,comment,1225398,1225718,0,0,brehaut,,,"Correct, it is finickity. I also probably resize my windows more than reach for the menu bar.<p>On the other hand, putting a direct manipulation control in the corner of the screen where it would get maximum fitt's law benefits would mean it was no longer a direct manipulation control which would make it significantly more finickity to perform the actual resize once you have 'acquired' the control_and_ would take that piece of valuable screen real-estate away from more useful controls.<p>Secondly, by attaching the menu bar to window you still have the same problem with a finickity resize control and you loose the advantage of the top anchored menu bar. Certainly window resizing in Windows is just as finickity (actually, possibly more so, windows in windows don't have to have the status bar resize thumb that is the norm in mac os x. I'm sure theres actual HCI research about windows vs mac os x resize interactions but I don't have any of it handy so wild speculation will have to do).<p>[Strange aside regarding Chrome: the window itself doesn't have a resize thumb (only border resizing) yet the text areas do. On the other hand there is no visual feedback to indicate that you have acquired the resize thumb]",1269835123

1225758,comment,1225011,1225179,0,0,patio11,,,"Denis has just given you some of the best advice I've seen on HN in my year here.  My few additions:<p>You don't have to quit the day job to build stuff.  Building stuff can be low-bandwidth, too.  Middle-aged middle-class women and small business owners have a <i>lot</i> of problems that can have a rough solution written in a week.  (Think like ""scheduling software for a beauty salon"": it is a CRUD app.  Not even a very difficult CRUD app.  I don't know if it can be marketed in an efficient fashion but I'm absolutely positive there is no technical risk involved in making a prototype and shopping that around.)<p>There are probably other tiers of problems which can be solved in a month or three months.  You can also gradually extend the v1.0 of your solution in terms of functionality or niches (salon scheduling... for massage therapists!  Salon scheduling... with online booking!  Salon scheduling...  en español!.)<p>Having a cash cushion is excellent advice, but ramen profitability (or day job profitability) is even nicer.  After that, the risk is truly minimal (if you have a profitable business selling salon scheduling, what is your main strategic risk -- people stop getting their hair done?) and your runway is infinite.<p>Incidentally, salon scheduling software presumably takes minimal time to maintain.  You could probably build it and maintain it on, oh, call it five hours a week.  That gives you a whole lot of time for pursuing other interests -- including perhaps a startup with larger ambitions or building the next great videogame, if you really want to do that.",1269834807

I wouldn't like to depend on the YUI servers like that and I don't see how adding a <script>-tag to load a plugin is too much work.<p>I can see this being a handy helper during testing (""let's check this one out, quickly""). But revolutionary is too big a word for that...<p><i>You seem to be asserting that verbosity === complexity. This is untrue.</i><p>Well, we'll have to agree to disagree there. Different mindsets I suppose.\nYUI clashes fundamentally with my all-time favorite programming quote:<p><pre><code>    Good code should be like a miniskirt:\n    long enough to cover the subject,\n    short enough to maintain interest.\n</code></pre>\nShoehorning javascript (a prototype based language) into a class model might have seemed like a good idea <i>before</i> jQuery came around. But now jQuery exists and I don't see why I should settle for less. Modularity and consistency are strong in jQuery land, too. JS code doesn't have to look like java to obtain these properties.<p>Now as this has turned into a framework rant (sorry) let me do YUI some justice, too.\nAs said, I don't see why <i>I</i> should settle for less but I do see at least one reason why others do. YUI does indeed have a strong (perhaps the strongest) library of unobtrusive modules and widgets. I'm absolutely looking forward to see whether they can sustain that edge. In my biased eye it seems like jquery UI is catching up fast, but time will tell.<p><i>ensuring optimal performance by [...] rather than having to load huge monolithic chunks of code that will never be executed.</i><p>That's wrong. Normally you <i>want</i> that one monolithic chunk because it will be fetched once and then be cached.

I read this:<p><i>For example, DSPS students often get a short sleep in the night, wake up early with an alarm clock, go to school where they are semi-conscious and perform poorly, get a solid nap after school and only late in the evening they regain vigor and their full mental powers. DSPS students feel best after midnight when everyone else is asleep and they can focus on learning or other activities (reading, Internet, watching TV, computer games, etc.).</i><p>And thought, ""this article is about me"".<p>In an effort to understand my own sleep patterns, I bought a Zeo.  After a week or so, I think I've found how things work.  If I get a lot of deep sleep, I may not ""feel awake"" or refreshed, but I can think really well.  If I get a lot of REM sleep, I feel great, but may not be in the mood to do anything.  With that in mind, I am trying to figure out how to get a good amount of both in the same sleeping session.<p>I haven't had a chance to try this yet, but my plan is to tire myself out (hopefully corresponding to nighttime, just to be in sync with the real world), get a lot of deep sleep, and then when I wake up, check that I've gotten enough REM sleep.  If not, back to bed until I feel satisfied.  (I am pretty good at getting REM sleep in the morning.  Alarm goes off, alarm set for +1:30, and I get about 1:15 worth of REM sleep.

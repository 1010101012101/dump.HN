He isn't dissuading beginners from learning to code or suggesting that people shouldn't. Just that you shouldn't learn to code just for the sake of knowing how to code.<p>I get it. There are worse hobbies you can have and it can solve problems and spread information, etc., etc. The point is that programming should be viewed as a means to an end. Too much focus is put on coding as an end goal and writers on TechCrunch whom I suspect have never coded anything in their lives talk about how learning to code is the hot new thing and everybody should be doing it. I think it is far more useful to learn a variety of subjects, figure out what it is you want to do, and if building software is the way to achieve it, then go learn to code. But learning to code well is an enormous investment of time, so to learn to code you are choosing not to do other things that could be far more valuable to you.<p>A lot of people start with learning to code and then look everywhere for a problem to solve with their new skill set. That is the reverse of how problems should be solved. The technology is irrelevant. The skills are irrelevant. The problem is what should dictate the work.",1337107982

I have 0 trust in PHP that my script really 'works' -- however, very often I have a lot more confidence in being able to get to something that 'seems to work' within 30 seconds.  Whereas, in Python I am pretty much guaranteed to spend 5-15 minutes on it.<p>As for web work.  I actually just did try ""how to tail a file in php"" and ""how to tail a file in python"".  On the PHP side I instantly saw this stackoverflow question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1102229/how-to-watch-a-file-write-in-php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1102229/how-to-watch-a-fi...</a> which links to this:<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/php-tail/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/php-tail/</a><p><i>Ability to tail small and big files for updates using PHP and AJAX.

If someone just HAPPENS to be looking for a quick tail through a web-browser, with grep functionality, this is a drop-in solution.

3978105,comment,3970566,3971322,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"The problem is, in the real world the performance divide between iterative and set-based solutions often spans much more than just one order of magnitude.  For someone who's got solid experience in constructing set-based queries, the SQL solution can quite often be simpler to read and refactor as well.  That's admittedly a big 'for', though.  Good database folks reason about this stuff in fundamentally different ways, and there's a lot more to creating a good database person than simply teaching a programmer SQL.<p>In respects like that, ORM's greatest benefit is also its greatest downfall.  Using an ORM means you can put people who don't have a strong grasp of databases in charge of your databases. Sadly, it also means that you've put people who don't have a strong grasp of databases in charge of your databases.<p>For that matter, only needing to be ""fast enough"" is fine if you're the only kid in the playground.  That's often a safe assumption to make if you're writing app code, but less so with databases.  If the database is being shared by a number of applications, or if the server is hosting multiple databases, or if you have to worry about concurrency, then being ""fast enough"" probably isn't enough.  Because you've also got to think about all the other ways that your queries could be affecting everyone else, and making sure you aren't subjecting your server to the tragedy of the commons.<p>Which comes to another nice thing about having a dedicated database person. It means there's someone whose official bailiwick is the DBMS.  If app A isn't experiencing any performance problems itself, but <i>is</i> causing performance problems for app B (say, because of some perverse locking situation), that's a bug that a DB guy is best positioned to diagnose and fix.  If the application isn't too tightly coupled to the database (i.e., sprocs are in place) then he can even quietly fix it on the server side without having to hassle anyone about the application code.  A team that's too ORM-reliant, on the other hand, risks failing to include anybody who's even well-equipped to <i>recognize</i> the problem, let alone fix it.",1337107662

This with a company that was already the most profitable tech company (2002). That is not a terrible performance, specifically because...<p>2) Had Microsoft gone with someone else, it's just as possible they could have ended up like HP, Dell or Yahoo.

Consumer Windows is not their lead profit machine any longer.<p>It's far more likely that someone would implode a company that is on top of the mountain, than that they would figure out how to create the first trillion dollar company. It's worth keeping that in mind: the only way Ballmer could have apparently succeeded by the article's qualification, is by creating a trillion dollar company out of a price per share ($60) that was derived from the greatest stock market bubble in world history.<p>There is a limit to how much money you can make at any given time in the global business eco-system.

My impression is (and I might be wrong, since I haven't had the time to study the new reducer library yet) that the point of this library is the following:<p>Many algorithms are tree-like in nature. Suppose, for instance, you have a path-finding algorithm that looks at a map to find the best path for something. In that case, you're going to need to search different path options iteratively to find the best path, leading to a nested algorithm.<p>Now, this type of algorithm is tricky to parallelize: Sometimes the root of your ""search tree"" might be small (let's say 3 items) other times it might be large (1000 items). If you know your computer has 8 cores, it's very hard to meter out an equal amount of work to each core- Sometimes several cores need to split the work of a single branch. Other times, a single core might need to handle multiple branches. Also, it may be hard to know ahead of time how much work each branch will require, making the ""parcelling out"" of work even more difficult.<p>However, the work for each branch can be expressed as a collection of smaller ""jobs"", with a function applied to each. And each item in this collection would then also be a  collection with functions applied to it (representing each sub-branch.) If you express a nested algorithm in this way, it can be viewed of as a nested collection with differing arbitrary functions mapped, filtered, etc across different parts of it.<p>If you use this new Reducer library to implement this type of nested operation, Clojure can automagically use the Java Fork/Join library to parcel out equal amounts of work to each core. In effect, you can think of the reducer library as letting you ""flatten"" these nested collections (without the memory & CPU cost this would entail) to figure out how to split the work out evenly and in the most efficient manner possible, hiding all the ugliness required for this from the programmer.<p>Please, if you know this library better than I, let me know where I'm going wrong.",1337107405

If they continue to decrease in size as they have been doing, they may actually end up being embedded in much of the stuff we use.<p>We should also notice that programming itself has a huge gradient in terms of difficulty. Things like Scratch, and other block programming languages make the act of programming easier, where amateur developers can focus more time on trying to solve the problems they are working on, and less time figuring out which parenthesis they missed.<p>So we have two trends - that programming is becoming easier to do, and that computers are becoming more common. Both of these lead me to the conclusion that not being able to program will eventually be akin to being illiterate. You won't be able to use and modify many of the tools of the future without some programming skill.<p>Further, many people are developing some of the core programming skills in pieces. Look at <a href=""http://ifttt.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifttt.com/</a> for example. This is an example of using apps as procedure calls, and writing very short subroutines to handle tasks for you. It is a perfect example of how programming is beginning to permeate popular culture.<p>Soon, telling people not to learn how to program will be much like telling people not to write or not to do math - it will be a bit ridiculous. We will just need to be able to use better systems for keeping track of who is an amateur, and who is a professional, much like we do with writing and mathematics.",1337107199

At one point, and for at least a few years, I believed Python was the one true language revealed mystically to GVR. Up until that point, I'd done most programming in C++, so you can imagine how much fun Python was, in comparison. After further development and discovery of other programming languages, the shortcomings of Python have become obnoxious, much like torturing someone by dripping water on their forehead incessantly. Part of the problem is that I have to use Python for my professional work now. Using a language for your day job is a sure way to reveal all the issues.<p>Here's what rubs me raw day-in and day-out:<p>1. Lack of immutable/persistent data structures.\n2. Lack of multi-line anonymous functions/lambda.\n3. Variable scoping fail, causing hacks like the new `nonlocal` keyword.\n4. worst_possible_variable_name_convention.\n5. Python evangelism. (community issue, mostly)\n6. Hypocritical ""explicit is better"" and ""flat over nested"" values with insane amounts of magic built into language and class system.\n7. No switch.\n8. GIL.

This is a niche product for people interested in their YouTube channels. Make a YouTube account if you don't have one already and find people that are YouTube partners. I'm a YouTube partner. It used to be a program difficult to get accepted into, but now I believe it's open to everybody. You'll know if someone is a YouTube partner if they have a banner next to the subscribe button above their videos. Subscribe to these people and message them letting them know about your app. Don't give everyone the same cookie cutter message. Try and spark up a discussion and also let them know about the app. YouTube partners make money off their videos, so they will be very interested in your app. I know I am! You can also target people with up and coming videos, meaning videos that you think are about to get popular and possibly viral. Tell them why you think that their video has potential, and then let them know your app can help them track their video statistics.<p>Once you've done that, spend extra time messaging everyone else on YouTube that has a video uploaded on their account. Choose people that are more active on YouTube, not people that haven't logged on in 3 months. I'd try targeting the demographic of young teens that make Apple related videos (I was once one of them). They usually have iOS devices and will be very interested in not only buying your app, but maybe even reviewing it as well.<p>As long as you fix your bugs and have a perfectly working product, with a little bit of hard work (in terms of marketing), you could make much more than $30 a month.<p>You can catch me at alexgreene7@me.com if you want to talk further.",1337107109

Andrew and Daphne should realize that flipping the classroom is not enough. The whole point of flipping the classroom is that most learning happens _outside_ the lecture hall. In an online context, this means that the emphasis must be on creating engaging and useful exercises and a vibrant online community. It also means that lectures have to be _far better_ than those delivered in the classroom. Taking your old powerpoints and inking over them while running screen-capture software just doesn't cut it.  Ask Vi Hart.<p>In addition, Coursera classes are run mostly within the framework designed for a university course -- complete with rigid schedules and limits on collaboration (dictated by honor code).  If my goal is simply to ""learn some subset of X"", not ""learn all of X in a given time frame and get tested on it"", this is all unnecessary baggage.<p>When Udacity completely separated itself from Stanford a few months back, I thought it was a risky move putting them at a disadvantage.

Of course you will definitely hear me say, ""I'd rather use python than Y"" but I'd also say, ""I'd rather use ruby than python""<p>I don't even get what he's trying to get at in paragraph three.

Python also has a pretty popular framework in django yet I don't really see any pressure by Guido to change python because of it.<p>Really this article is a pretty ignorant view of ruby since he himself admits he does not know much about ruby.

In November, voters will have the first opportunity ever to decide between the death penalty and a sentence of life in prison with absolutely no chance of parole.  Back in 1978, we did not have an alternative sentence that would keep convicted killers behind bars forever. We certainly did not know that we would spend $4 billion on 13 executions. Our system is broken, expensive and it always will carry the grave risk of a mistake.

It has improved now of course, but I still have something lurking in the back of my mind that says Python is faster than Ruby.<p>Documentation is a huge thing.  I found the docs difficult to navigate, and only in the last few months (whenever the latest change was) are they easier to navigate.  But the descriptions are still pretty spartan and it's hard to find what function your looking for if you don't know what it's called.  The way names are chosen doesn't match with my experience from other languages (Java, C, PHP, Scheme).  So I tend to use Stack Overflow a lot more than the Ruby docs themselves.<p>A good book helps get past the hurdles of knowing what function to use for what.  However, the only real examples in the Ruby books I've read are in Rails books.  So that might be part of the cultural issue jamesgeck refers to.  Poor docs + book focus on Rails means you can only learn Ruby for the purpose of Rails, and that typecasts it as a web language.<p>Note that PHP is stuck as a web language even more than Ruby.  PHP is meant to be one, of course, but it's still usable as a general systems scripting language.  I've written a nightly cronjob billing system in PHP since then the web frontend, which was PHP, and the cron job back end could all share the same billing libraries.  I've also written small compilers and other scripts in PHP.  That was before I was very comfortable with Python and Ruby (and had most of PHP's standard lib memorized), but PHP still worked fine.<p>I tend to use Ruby now for most scripts, except where other people require me to use Python, like where some shared team library I need only works with Python.  So, there are at least SOME cases where Python is mandatory and not voluntary.",1337104939

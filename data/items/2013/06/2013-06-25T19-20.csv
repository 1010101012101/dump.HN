The peel&#x27;s color is what give a wine that dark red color hue. (Try squeezing the juice out of red grapes. You&#x27;ll find that the outcome doesn&#x27;t have the same color as red wine!)<p>Now, peels have things called &quot;tannins&quot; which give fruit peels their bitter flavor.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever had tea which was steeped for a very long time, and is thus very bitter, you are tasting tannins.<p>Which is an interesting point - we would all easily tell the difference between strongly-brewed tea and mild tea. Or coffee. And we might have a preference for one versus the other.<p>The taste of wine - being that it is &quot;brewed&quot; in grape skins - is affected in an identical way! But we never ask &quot;is tea bullshit?&quot; because we can all very well tell the difference between certain flavors of tea.<p>This is why the &quot;red food coloring&quot; part gets to me. A red wine that was lightly steeped is likely to taste similar to a white wine! There&#x27;s not enough information to know.<p>This is not to say that marketing, color, price, etc are not huge factors in the enjoyment of wine.<p>But at the end of the day, the taste of wine is affected by the same things that would affect any other fruit or leaf-based food, so the idea that wine is any more bullshit than eggs, maple syrup, or tea doesn&#x27;t really coincide with our personal experiences.",1372190231

Ummm, I&#x27;m not sure if you are an American, or not, but those of us who believe in the US Constitution, as well as its Bill of Rights, know that the words contained therein are the only thing stopping our government from becoming another East Germany/North Korea style police state.<p>The 4th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America plainly lays out the right of the people to be secure in their persons, papers, and effects (the communications media of the era,) and it also spells out the requirements which the government must meet in order to breach that right to privacy. The current domestic surveillance program fails to meet these requirements on many levels.<p>Perhaps <i>you</i> don&#x27;t find the abrogation of our Bill of Rights to be evidence of a government gone <i>&quot;completely out of the control.&quot;</i> but a vast number of &quot;We the People&quot; are outraged at a great many of the acts being done in our name, without our consent.<p>Secret courts, secret judges, secret police, secret wars, secret torture...<p>Does any of that sound familiar?<p>The terrorism excuse is flimsy at best, especially in light of the fact that exponentially fewer Americans are harmed by terrorist acts than are killed by drunk driving on an annual basis.
Prescription drugs kill more Americans each year than all of the terrorist acts in the last 10 years combined.<p>It seems that those who would choose to marginalize the fact that our government has overstepped its mandate would rather shun the intent of the very Bill of Rights which made America the beacon of freedom and liberty for all.<p>History has a way of repeating itself, and those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.<p>This <i>&quot;silly little game&quot;</i> is neither silly, nor little, this issue deals with an attack upon our Bill of Rights, which so many have fought and died for.",1372189683

I don&#x27;t have much to add except that I urge you to make it a priority to manage your stress level during this difficult time, and to not make important decisions in a fragile mental state. Try to be a rock for the other team members, and be professional. Lean on your wife for support, and be honest with others about your situation. Bottling all this up inside is counter-productive and makes it worse. There is no shame in your situation - you took a risk and tried to do something really hard.<p>Having said that, a month to live is still a month to live. Talk about the situation with your team members and advisors and try to figure out whether or not it&#x27;s salvageable. Perhaps, after making some difficult choices, there&#x27;s a way that you can still continue. There have been moments in my own startup experience where things seemed really bleak and hopeless, and it seemed time to give up, but in the end we actually got past it. Another friend of mine had a situation where he literally had no money left in the bank and took the company to Vegas on credit card (I don&#x27;t advise this!), when someone threw him a $200k life preserver at the 11th hour.<p>I guess the question you really have to ask yourself is whether you still believe in what you&#x27;re doing. If the answer is no, then I think your involvement with the company has to end, which may or may not be fatal for the startup overall.

It&#x27;s not as if exclusively using couriers, dead drops and the like has no costs to an organisation (say, have you moved off GMail yet?) Apparently some fairly serious terrorists are using the Internet in more secure ways, but the spooks have some ability to go after those too.<p>2) Any big network or organisations is going to have slipups, no matter how good it is. It would be hard to imagine that no serious terrorist ever gets lazy, or decides to take a risk under time pressure.<p>3) There have to be a lot of guys who start out as Facebook jihadis, and only later get serious and realise (or have it explained to them) that they need to stop making it easy for the authorities to track them. But by that time they&#x27;ll already have left a useful trail of contacts and activity through FB. (By the way, that&#x27;s one reason why I think it&#x27;s wrong to assume that PRISM has been useless even if it hasn&#x27;t stopped any specific attacks. Realistically, that kind of intelligence is going to be less about discovering big plots <i>just in time</i> and more about gathering enough information to locate and move on terrorists - espcially if you can then turn them into informers.

Even though there&#x27;s supposed to be a well defined and constantly prioritized queue of features to be completed during each sprint, the fact that they can be changed and moved around means it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to nail down an actual deliverable beyond a vague &quot;payment of milestone X due upon completion of code sprint&quot;, which is really no different than a duration-based payment schedule which basically boils down to T&M :D<p>FP is generally (not always) better for both the buyer and provider because:<p>1. Buyer benefit: For a given scope there is a corresponding, known budget. Typically, fixed/forecasted budgets are preferred by buyers so they can forecast and set internal expectations.<p>2. Seller benefits:<p>(i) If it&#x27;s a task that you feel can be done quickly or with less effort than normal (e.g. done repeatedly for others in the past), you can still charge based on the VALUE of the work vs. the # LABOUR UNITS, ultimately resulting in a higher margin for the seller with a tightly scoped budget for the buyer, <i>even though it takes you less time to complete</i>. The only time you need to consider lowering list prices for work done several times in a row is when a perception of commoditization creeps in, either by the general industry or (more likely) by the customer(s).<p>(ii) T&M is more profitable for you in the short term, but often causes more overhead and problems for the buyer on larger deals as scope uncertainty and ambiguity increases. Typically, the easier you make your buyer&#x27;s life in terms of reducing overhead and paperwork, the more likely they are to want to work with you in the future.<p>>>There&#x27;s always scope, but for sub-2k jobs (and worse for sub-1k) there&#x27;s a trade-off between time spent tying down the scope and time doing the job.<p>Sounds like you&#x27;re an independent freelancer. In this instance, you&#x27;re in a tough spot. I suggest putting in 1.5hrs that you swallow from a cost basis with a firm goal to minimize potential risks during the engagement.<p>The worst part of being an independent is that your overhead is typically higher if you try to go the FP route for higher-valued deals as you are solely responsible for writing the SOWs, thinking about the timelines, managing the customer AND delivering. I can absolutely understand why, in that situation, you&#x27;re comparative advantage is defaulting with T&M in most situations and hopefully raising your prices a bit to compensate for the inevitable pre-sales discussions you need to have with potential customers.<p>Sorry I can&#x27;t give more advice there. I&#x27;ve found patio111&#x27;s posts to be very informative for independents looking to grow.",1372188224

No Problem : Desktop Video Recording w/o A Webcam.",,"One of the sticking points in our sales process has been that our video recording feature was dependent on the user having a webcam to work (duh). While this may seem like an obvious limitation it didn&#x27;t stop us from getting the &quot;what about people without webcams&quot; question from marketing folks. Until recently our answer has been that users can record videos on their computer (using desktop software) then upload that file. Unfortunately, this was a bulky process for the end-user and often an attrition point.<p>Recently we came up with a solution to this &quot;issue&quot; that we think is kinda cool / fun and we wanted to share it with you guys. Using CameraTag users can now record videos using their mobile devices (iOS 6.0+ and Android 2.2+) directly into their desktop browser. The recorder has a &quot;record by phone&quot; option which will SMS them a link to record a new video on their phone. After recording the videos is instantly populated into the desktop form (URLs for h.264, webm, and thumbnails). As we have come to say now: No webcam? No Problem.<p>It&#x27;s not groundbreaking technology but we think it&#x27;s a pretty cool aggregation of existing technologies that produce a &quot;wow&quot; effect for clients and users.<p>You can check out an example on our homepage http://cameratag.com (click the &quot;record by phone&quot; link in the recorder).<p>Welcome your thoughts / feedback

I can move code around quite easily in Java.<p>I don&#x27;t find it to be the same at all in practice. Lisp has a huge advantage in this because the code is written by manipulating the AST. You see the tree and the branches of executions visually. So, I can say I want to move this node to that position, or extract this node into a separate function.<p>I find it&#x27;s like playing with lego. You just stick individual pieces of logic together to produces complex functionality.<p>You simply can&#x27;t do this in Java on any practical level in my experience. It also doesn&#x27;t help that Java code is imperative so even if you selected a block of logic, it doesn&#x27;t mean you can just move it elsewhere without any side effects.<p>>Usefulness of macros is overrated. In my experience, the s-exp syntax is too high price for macros. I like Julia&#x27;s approach to macros much more.<p>I strongly disagree, I find macros are incredibly useful. Clearly most people agree as some sort of a macro system creeps up into pretty much every language.<p>However, most languages don&#x27;t allow you to apply the language to itself when templating code. So you end up with special crufty syntax that eventually becomes a whole separate language that you have to learn.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what price you&#x27;re talking about either. I actually prefer s-exps to ALGOL style syntax. With s-exps your code is very regular and it follows the principle of least astonishment much better than alternatives.<p>There are no inherent downsides to the syntax, if anything it makes the interaction between pieces of code more visually apparent. It provides extra visual information about the structure of the code. I personally like that very much.",1372187440

Yes, there are more instances of death by hammer in the USA in a given year than there are terrorist attacks.  But, the terrorist attacks have the potential for much larger impact (see links, below).  Consider a 2-dimensional score for threat scenarios where we multiply likelihood of occurrence by potential impact for the following scenarios:<p>Scenario A:<p>Bludgeoned to death by a hammer.<p>Scenario B:<p>Terrorists recover a missing Cold-war era nuke, and detonate it over Iowa, during the winter.  Effects are: nuclear explosion, EMP pulse disrupting power grid and electronics, disruption in home heating and food/medical supplies, downwind radioactive fallout over Chicago, Ohio, Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston, New York, Baltimore, DC, etc..<p>Scoring (pulling these numbers out of my arse for illustration purposes):<p>Scenario A: 6000 occurrences per year * 1.2 deaths per occurrence = 12000<p>Scenario B: 0.2 terrorist occurrences per year * (10 million fatalities + ((0.5 fatality / endangered) * 150 million endangered) =  17 million<p>As you can see, the terrorism is a lot more serious than hammers (or kittens).

The weird thing is many of these folks have semi-normal lives. They might be using secure communications to talk about blowing something up but they also have their day to day lives of sending totally irrelevant e-mails to friends and family that perhaps were not secured. We already knew the CIA has used intercepted e-mail recipient lists to build social graphs of the fringes of these organizations. Identifying who is 2-3 steps removed from these organizations actually does have value especially to identify funding and support networks.",1372187042

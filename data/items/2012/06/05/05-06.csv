Maybe if you are working on rote J2EE or .Net software you can do four hours a day of work and know exactly the time it will take to complete, but you aren't going to be working on the same project with full timers.  Someone working full time is going to complete the same work in two days that a part timer is going to do in seven.  Full time workers are not going to wait an additional five days for dependencies the part time guy is working on.  And they're not going put dependencies in place, then wait for the part timer guy to add 150% to the schedule finishing their part.  This is not bad teamwork.  This is scheduling.<p>I know you are not suggesting this, but I should point out that the idea that the team does tasks as a group around one computer is the amateur's view of software development.  In this instance, one might think that part time is feasible because they will just join in on whatever the ONE task that the group happens to be engaged in.  I see this a lot in inexperienced managers who think software development is like a meeting except with a computer to type on.<p>Part timers by definition are not fully invested.  Their work is defined by time constraints rather than project delivery.  What will you do if four hours is not enough, work four more hours?",1338874298

I did not like where things were headed with most startups in the past couple of years. The Facebook IPO was like a fire extinguisher that happened to contain a small fire before it got way too out-of-control.<p>If your startup has no business model, you better think of one fast. If your startup has no revenue or a lack of it, you better start generating a lot more really soon. If your startup has a solid business model and is cash-flow positive, it's time to start leap-frogging the competition and adjusting the course. This is the time when good companies become great ones.",1338872599

3536272,comment,3534746,3535667,2,0,meric,,,"In addition to everything a python class can do, you can also use setmetatable() to modify the metatable of a table at runtime. A metatable is also just a table so you don't have to assign it to designated ""metatables"". You can for example even set the metatable of a table to <i>itself</i>.<p>The metatable is more general and conceptually simpler. It doesn't have to be the ""class"" of an ""object"", it can implement other patterns to OO without feeling weird, because the assumption that metatable is ""Object Oriented"" just isn't there.<p>Do you have python beginners touching metaclasses? I doubt it. Do you have lua beginners touching metatables? Certainly yes.",1328061565

While currency may have different values based on location, time, effort, knowledge, experience shouldn't be so different in value. Don't you agree? I don't want to single out any countries, but just as an example, let's say American developers typically charge ~US$100 per hour, why would Indian developers charge US$15.00 (or vice-versa) for the same work? Doesn't that kind of ""race to the bottom"" simply de-value the profession and make things harder all around? If you have made the investment of getting educated, learning the technology, learning the business and can produce; you should be charging and getting paid accordingly, depending on the market, not your local currency or local minimum wage. When dealing with your local market, you will need to take local rates into consideration, but I don't see any reason to apply local rates and limitation to an international (Internet) market. I would genuinely like to know if I am completely off base, and if anyone has more insight on this.",1328061300

In the short run, this action harms both your face and my hand, and I might accidentally step on your victim in the process. Counterproductive, right? But in the long run, it provides you an incentive to stop punching the victim, and they wind up better off. Similarly, economic sanctions against South Africa would harm everyone in South Africa (including the victims), but might cause the ruling elite to change their behavior.<p>In contrast, if you are sick, punching you won't help. You are now more motivated to get beterbut so what? There is no simple action you can take to become better. Sanctions against China or Foxconn are closer to this situation - there is no simple action they can take to stop being poor.<p>Interestingly, I've been told by a couple of black South African that life was indeed better in many ways under apartheid. As it was described to me, ""at least under apartheid, if your sister gets gang raped, the cops will beat down the N<i></i>* who did it.""

To the point that he went back and made changes to the Doom 3 source[1], at the time a four year old game, to appease the lawyers who were shy to allow them to release it because of software patent concerns.<p>If you're looking for the game, then yes the source is useless to you. If you're looking to learn what went in to the game to make it work, the source is literally invaluable. With art assets, it would be better. But by itself it is such a precious treasure.

They keep old stuff around. I have no idea where I would go dig up a Win95 disc (or stack of diskettes, for that matter), but I am fairly certain I could find it on TPB, and it would be seeded.<p>Beyond that, preservation of anything is an ongoing effort. Who is to say that copy on Amazon won't sell out? How do you know if it will even work when you get it. Some day physical media will go away, and you won't be able to read the CDs the game was pressed to. Git Hub will go away one day too. But moving the code to Git Hub represents a continued preservation effort on id's part, because previously this stuff was just hosted on id's FTP where no one could find it unless they knew to look for it. Being on Git Hub now makes it available to more people, for longer, should (god forbid) anything happen to id software.<p>So, despite the fact that his flame bait comment has been deleted, it raised some valid points about software and media preservation overall.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thepiratebay.org/blog/60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thepiratebay.org/blog/60</a>",1328059264

Lua is straight ANSI C and can compile on much more limited systems than a Linux-based smartphone.<p>One other data point: Guile is 5x the size of Lua, in both source and binary forms.<p>> To continue, guile has continuations (delimited or otherwise), and macros (hygienic or otherwise), both of which are effectively missing in lua.<p>One of the authors of Lua made an interesting point in his slides describing Lua 5.2: if you think ""goto"" is evil, continuations are much worse.  And yet it's considered ""cool"" to support continuations.  <a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/talks/novelties-5.2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/talks/novelties-5.2.pdf</a>",1328058828

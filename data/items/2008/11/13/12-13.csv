363001,comment,361868,362761,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I like RDF for its flexibility, but OWL is very weak. You can't even define very basic constraints that RDBMS schema languages have had for ages. All value constraints on properties have to be constants. So, for example, you cannot state that shipping_date must greater than order_date.<p>Querying RDF triples within reasonable performance constraints is very hard for the general case. I've tried a lot in that area. You just can't get around the fact that not using upfront knowledge about access paths to define the storage structures means to accept a huge number of joins. However, it's certainly a possibility to encode that knowledge in indexes instead of the logical data model.<p>Column databases seem to be promising for RDF storage and query.",1226580226

That is what Resig was trying to find out.<p><i>And that the Windows GetTickCount/GetTime functions have a bad precision is common knowledge.</i><p>Yet the SunSpider benchmark is often used to measure browser performance. If, as Resig says, <i>the error rate for any test run in [Internet Explorer 8, Opera, Safari, and WebKit Nightly] would be huge</i> then SunSpider benchmarks don't have a lot of value.",1226579876

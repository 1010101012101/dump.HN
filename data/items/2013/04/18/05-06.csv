Sometime in 2010, just as Bitcoin was gaining traction, he* withdrew from the project and no one has been heard from him since.<p>There have been many attempts to discover the real identity of this person/group/company/government but to no avail.<p>I believe the focus of this new analysis technique, whilst interesting in its own right, was done for the primary purpose of trying to identify Satoshi. The analysis technique purports to show that certain bitcoins were generated by the same person/computer. This information may assist the tracing of historical bitcoin transactions to their original sources. At the top of the tree is the 'genesis' block - the source of the very first bitcoins. Its reasonable to think that Satoshi mined this block considering he invented the system.<p>There is a thread in the Bitcoin forums[1] discussing whether the initial blocks (up to around 50) were mined by an individual or a group. There is heated debate about what, if any, facts can be concluded by analysing the early blockchain events to discover how many (and what type) of CPUs were involved in this early stage.<p>Satoshi appears to have political motivations (he references distain for bailouts and fiat currency): <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto</a><p>The Bitcoin story would make a good movie script.<p>*he/she/they/...I<p>[1] <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1843782#msg1843782"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1843782#ms...</a>",1366264283

This isn't going to attract much attention.\n4) There is no historical data to backtest strategies...not that it would be helpful while bitcoin behaves like a penny stock.<p>HFT for bitcoin is pointing a bazooka at a cockroach.

5569039,comment,5567239,5568832,3,0,davesque,,,"For most intents and purpose, ""controllers"" from so called MVC frameworks are referred to as ""views"" in Django.<p>The article that edavis mentions does make one good point, which is that the term ""view"" was chosen to emphasize the notion that the python callback function (or object) sets up a view of the data represented by the models.  I think there's something good in this choice of words.  I find the terms ""view"" and ""template"" more intuitively meaningful than the corresponding ""controller"" and ""view"".<p>One important, substantive difference that I'm aware of between controllers in many MVC frameworks (probably not all) and views in Django is that a lot of MVC frameworks map requests to controller actions through URL traversal, whereas Django offers a more hands-on approach with URL confs.<p>Also, whereas controllers are often implemented through classes in MVC frameworks, views in Django may be implemented through any callable object which accepts a request and returns a response.<p>As far as where your code should go, it probably depends on what kind of data the user is entering.  If the data must be persisted in the database somehow, such as with transactions in a bank account, then the code that crunches the numbers would probably be in a method on a ""BankAccount"" or ""Transaction"" model class.  If it's data that only really needs to persist for the user's individual browsing session, then it's probably safe to put the code that works on it in a view.  Django limits what kinds of things you can do in its templates (thankfully), so you probably won't have much luck putting your computation code in a template.",1366262696

I've speculated for a while now that you could do a twitter equivalent of hellbanning where people who were hellbanned saw their robot followers but people who were considered 'legit' saw the number that twitter actually thought were people. If you just blow away the bot followers then the people who have them will be disillusioned and not actually use twitter or point people at it, so it is in Twitter's interest to have them out their pushing the story 'follow me on Twitter, everyone else does!' even if that is fake. Hopefully those people will find <i>someone</i> real to follow and become customers.",1366262688

I don&#x27;t fall often, but it happens more often than when walking and is definitely scarier. I mostly don&#x27;t do &quot;sports&quot;, I just commute.<p>And since bikes don&#x27;t have ABS, I either have brakes that are not powerful enough, or I have brakes that throw me over the bar if I a mistake in a  surprising situation (such as in the case I mentioned). Most falls I have are due to ice. Every winter morning is a decision: do I take the bike with studded tyres, or the one that is much lighter to ride?

Sometimes people are driven by their knowledgeable and passion, but there is also a large group driven by selfish desire to promote themselves or an agenda. The guy who wants to be in charge so he can be in charge instead of lead, is not the guy you want in charge.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how much wasted energy is spent on pseudo science. From zero-energy devices to &quot;secret&quot; cancer cures. Those involved create boogie men(usually the government) who are repressing &quot;the truth&quot;, as the actual data to support their claims is weak. Rallying people against a common enemy is easier than coming up with an actual product that works. It&#x27;s incredibly lazy, and usually a few minutes of research will cast doubt on claims.

A driver should be forced to respect a cyclist and give them room.<p>In California, (yeah California) there is now a 3 foot minimum passing distance ( <a href=""https://calbike.org/advocacy/giveme3/give-me-3-faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://calbike.org/advocacy/giveme3/give-me-3-faq/</a> )<p><i>&quot;The law is invaluable when a bicyclist is injured in a collision. It establishes a clear basis for citing motorists for unsafe passing.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;How do motorists give three feet on narrow roads?</i><p><i>&quot;State law has never guaranteed motorists a right to pass whenever or wherever they want. Motorists may only pass when it’s safe to do so. This doesn’t change with the Three Feet for Safety Act.</i><p><i>&quot;The new law requires motorists to slow down and wait to pass only when it is safe to do so. Motorists have to be prepared to demonstrate that three feet were NOT available and the slower, closer pass was done according to the law. This is a higher burden of proof for drivers than we have under the current law, which places no conditions on how to pass at a “safe distance.”</i><p>So hopefully, the police will aggressively ticket motorists acting in a way that is unsafe for cyclists.",1420137822

Life moves fast in the world of startups, so we&#x27;re looking for someone accustomed to filling technical gaps and rapidly moving between projects.  Flexibility is a must.  Our tech stack is primarily python/javascript, so familiarity with those languages is recommended.<p>Backend Engineer:
We&#x27;re looking for a backend engineer with experience building reliable distributed systems to deal with large amounts of traffic.  An ideal candidate would have a love for software architecture, a knack for building high throughput, high availability APIs, and experience with python.  Dev-ops experience is also a huge plus.<p>Data Engineer:
A high quality dataset is arguably even more important than a bleeding-edge machine learning model.  We&#x27;re looking for a scrappy developer who is comfortable with data preprocessing, data normalization, and data collection (web scraping, mechanical turk, etc.).<p>Front End Developer:
We&#x27;re looking for a developer with design sense to build a beautiful, functional web interface for indico. An ideal candidate would have a deep appreciation for user experience, dream in javascript/coffeescript, and know the ins and outs of clean HTML/CSS layout.<p>Technical Writer:
Machine learning is a highly technical field, and we&#x27;re looking for someone to help us reach out to the broader community of developers and data scientists. Responsibilities include writing excellent tutorials, documentation, and blog articles that help tell our story to the world. Although prior data science experience is not required, passion to learn more about the field is a must.<p>Interested?  Send an email to contact@indico.io.",1420137318

Some people are certainly trying, but I don&#x27;t think anyone beats Rails in these two areas yet.<p>You specifically mentioned starting a new project.  I think that&#x27;s where Ruby and Rails are the strongest.  Maintaining a large system might be better done using some other language and framework.",1420135590

I, for example, am not very good at picking up and remembering information from hearing someone speak. Taking notes (or just doodling) helps keep me focused on what the speaker is saying, and my notes give me something that I can read over later to process at my own pace.",1420135487

Justworks - <a href=""http://www.justworks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justworks.com</a><p>We are building a platform for people to administer every part of their business, starting with payroll, benefits, compliance and tax filing. We&#x27;ve also built out PTO tracking, some reporting/analytics features and a B2B payments feature. We aren&#x27;t just about payroll.<p>We are a PEO, which means we coemploy our customers employees (similar to Trinet/Ambrose or ADP Total Source, if you&#x27;ve ever heard of those). Because of that we&#x27;re able to do a lot of really cool things including offer health insurance at a massive discount, as well as bring many other benefits traditionally reserved for large companies to startups and SMBs. We&#x27;re growing very quickly (35-40% month over month) and just raised a $6mm series A from Thrive, Index, a few others[1].  Our founders are former Amazon, Etsy and Groupon executives who have had successful startups in the past.<p>We handle payments and lots of very sensitive information (bank numbers, social security numbers etc.) so we need people who are comfortable working in that environment. Basically we&#x27;re looking for senior level engineers to help build the foundation for a really awesome engineering org. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions (will@justworks.com).<p>No contractors, no remotes, sorry.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/10/09/justworks-rai.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/10/09/justworks-rai...</a>.",1420135344

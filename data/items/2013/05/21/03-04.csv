The below is pretty much pulled straight from it, although I simplify it slightly (by assuming one pattern, etc.)<p>First, Alice and Bob decide on a pattern P. Then they each compute a key K(A) and K(B) using the pattern P by shining P through their slab. Then, they publicly publish P and K(A)  K(B). (Apologies for the lack of good mathematical notation, but HN is not a great medium for such.)<p>Because P, K(A), and K(B) are all random, the attacker learns no useful information from these two published items.<p>Now, for Alice to encrypt a message m, she computes K(A)  m and sends it to Bob.  Once Bob gets it, he uses the public pattern P to recreate K(B). Then he uses the publicly published K(A)  K(B) to compute:<p>K(B)  [K(A)  K(B)]  (K(A)  m)<p>which is in fact m. At any time, the Eve can only know P (useless since she doesn't have either slab) and K(A)  K(B), which is not enough to recover the key or message.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3886"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3886</a>",1369108081

Have fun stashing your cash under your mattress.  Or maybe you'd rather just have gold bars, but I hear those aren't as valuable as they used to be these days[0].<p>This is nonsense.  Fractional reserve banking[1] has existed for literally centuries.  Based on the concept that ""not all depositors need their money at the same time"" and ""most creditors pay back their loans,"" a bank can give out loans in excess of the cash they have on hand.<p>Naturally, this isn't full-proof.  Banks can make too many loans, and too many of those loans go bad, and not actually have any money when depositors want their money back.  This possibility used to end up being self-fulfilling -- if you thought your bank was at risk of not having enough money to repay your deposits, then you'd immediately withdraw your money, and if everyone did this, then they really would likely not have enough money to pay back your deposits.<p>You'd have fractional reserve banking even if the currency was anchored to some sort of asset like gold.  I'd urge anyone to try and imagine a world where banks were required to have 100% of what they loaned out backed in full by deposits.  Credit would be extremely tight.  Almost any successful business -- internet startup or otherwise -- starts with some credit, and you'd basically be throwing a huge roadblock into any brilliant but capital-intensive idea.  Did you invent an amazing prototype and now want to get a loan so you can build a factory and crank out and sell your new invention?  Well, guess you have to wait until a bank has enough in deposits to loan out, of which they'll probably charge you usurious interest rates, since they can't tolerate any risk of eventual default because that could bring their below 100% of deposits.<p>In lieu of requiring banks to cover 100% of loans with deposits, in the the US we have things like FDIC insurance, and we <i>had</i> laws like Glass-Steagall, to minimize the chance of bank runs and bank defaults happening, and to mitigate the impact when it does.  I'm sure all the resident HN Paulbots are already furiously pounding away at their keyboards ready to blast my naivete about fiat currency, government manipulation, inflation, Ben Bernanke being the spawn of Satan, Too Big to Fail, etc.  To me, those are separate from the OP's point, which attacks fractional reserve banking as some sort of Great Lie that needs to be expunged.<p>[0] <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/20/dead-ingot-bounce/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/20/dead-ingot-bounc...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking</a>",1369106250

When they said they wouldn't give preferential treatment to Blogger they might have only been thinking about search results and nothing else. So in their mind they didn't break any agreement.<p>Conversely the other side might have thought ""If Google runs a TV ad for Blogger they have to run TV ads for all other competing blogging systems and give them equal time.""<p>Neither side is wrong, they just failed to convey what they were actually thinking when saying ""no preferential treatment"".<p>I've been in a similar situation where I has a partner in a small game dev company. We got a contract from a publisher to implement a game they had mostly designed already. When signing the deal we were told we could have input into the design. What the publisher meant was ""We'll consider your comments and tweak a few things if we agree with them."" What some of my partners heard was ""The design can be 100% thrown away and re-created from scratch by us"".<p>Needless to say there was lots of frustration on both sides.",1369105746

I would feel much more comfortable paying that money directly to charity (of which I donate considerably to, also which don't include loans to my friends, which by the way aren't tax deductible either way), or failing that, would rather pay it into a state funded initiative, where the dollars will be kept closer to home and be more efficiently spent according to the needs of the state.  Obviously this works better in small states like Maryland than larger ones like California or Texas, but it still allows them more control to exercise than something handed down from the federal government.",1369105408

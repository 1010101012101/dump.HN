A complex and rich taste all by itself, so you don't have to add much to it.<p>Soba takes eight minutes to cook, but the meal is even faster if you prep it beforehand. It's best eaten cold, so just pop it out of the fridge.<p>Chop other stuff to put into it. Tofu, green onions, mushrooms, peas, whatever.<p>Broth is awesome if you have it, but I can get by with a few dabs of soy sauce.<p>Add some red pepper flakes. Done.",1206259096

If I wanted to imply something, I'd say it.</i><p>If you want people to read what you say literally instead of drawing inferences, don't use metaphors.<p><i>Seeing those guys on their scavenger hunt was like seeing lions in a zoo after spending several years watching them in the wild.</i><p>Do you mean that these scavenger hunters were pacing around and growling?  Of course not -- you expect us, as readers who understand the nuances of English, to understand that this is a metaphor; to think about the differences between caged and uncaged lions; and to project those differences onto humans.<p>Guess what?  Metaphors are imprecise.  Different people have different notions concerning how caged and uncaged lions differ.  Different people will project these properties onto humans in different ways.<p>I agree entirely with what you're saying in the essay, but I think it might have been far more effective if one of your proof-readers had said ""you know, this is liable to be misinterpreted, maybe you can reword it?""",1206258555

Use it for your day to day email as much as possible as soon as the probability of it losing/corrupting messages is low. If you find yourself going back to your old client, write the code you need to so you don't have to.<p>Decide what's going to be the most important things about your app and work hard to get those right. All the ""it would be cool if.."" stuff can wait till later. Only focus on the essence to begin with. Then, release it and see what people think and go from there.",1206258327

143887,comment,143735,143862,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>Who would remember something like that after two years?</i><p>I think most academics do.<p>My own story: When I was an undergraduate student, I wrote a paper which gave sharp bounds on the round-off errors resulting from computing FFTs using floating-point arithmetic; and I noticed that my bound was much better than the bound given by Higham in his Numerical Analysis textbook (which is, by quite a wide margin, the most widely used textbook in the field).  I sent him an email -- ""Dear sir, I noticed that in section X.Y of this book, you prove a bound of N sqrt(N) log(N) instead of N log(N); if you change foo to bar in your argument, you'll get the stronger bound which I prove in my paper (see attachment)"" -- and he wrote back to thank me and tell me that he would make sure the improved bound was in the next edition of the textbook.<p>A year later, a copy of said textbook arrived in the mail, ""compliments of the author"".<p>Two years after that, when I was a graduate student at a different university, I went to a talk by Higham; and at the end when we were asked for questions, I introduced myself (by name, no mention of FFTs) and asked a question.  Higham answered my question, and then went on -- in front of most of the department -- to announce that I had found an error in the first edition of his textbook, and that when I wrote to him he had assumed that I was a professor rather than an undergraduate student.<p>I think ""star professors"" are actually <i>more</i> likely to remember things like this, simply because someone pointing out something they didn't know, or a mistake they made, is so unusual.  It's people like Chomsky, Higham, and Knuth who remember such contributions and can afford to send out free books -- or $2.56 cheques -- to those who provide them.",1206257759

It is nice to believe that it's just lack of inspiration, or misconceptions about the process, but is there anything else? Maybe.<p>Or maybe it is because people truly do not want to work hard. Never in my life have I met someone who prioritizes hacking above all else for more than the time it would take to defeat a small video game.<p>One question, by ""start a startup,"" would that refer to getting decent investment and living a quality of life overall comparable to that of one's peers, or bootstrapping and every day fighting for survival with a hope that one day the tides will turn? If the later then those outside the valley are going to be inspired with a much stronger ""yearning for the sea"" before they will make the jump without regret.",1206257759

What would a client look like that allowed you to process between 1,000 and 10,000 inbound messages a day, answering 1-10% of them, in 2-4 hours of clock time.

143873,comment,143778,143798,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"I was thinking the exact same thing when I first read it.  There's got to be some kind of criteria in place to keep it effective and focused.  Even if it's just  a simple, written application stating who you are, why you want to be there, etc; at least then you can tell if you're dealing with an intelligent human being and if they're serious or not. That said, I'd be really interested in seeing a series of camps that helps those of us in the early, formative stages.  It also seems like a great way to learn to develop ideas and meet potential cofounders.",1206256060
143871,comment,143148,143269,0,0,h34t,,,"I think your example shows the importance of learning how shrewd businesspeople think.<p><< example #1 >><p>My first business mentor was literally a con artist. I was starting my first business and he, ostensibly a retired lawyer, took me under his wing... while we worked together he helped me a lot, but one day he skipped town and left me (and a few other people) screwed.<p>It was some of the best money I ever spent on education -- it's not every day you get exposed to deception at that level of sophistication.<p>Since then I've interacted with some very ethical businesspeople who understand things in a remarkably similar way to that con artist -- they are acutely aware of the mechanics of perception manipulation, which can be applied to good or bad ends in almost any conceivable field of endeavor.<p><< example #2 >><p>One big reason I burnt out last year is because I didn't pay attention to what I'd learned in example #1 because I started a company with ethical people I knew extremely well (read: even if you're with great people, you still need to know exactly what you're committing to).<p>I had equity, but I was the youngest & least-experienced founder, and left behind the other founder & founder-investor in N. America to go and manage <i>everything</i> myself on the other side of the world, in China.<p>A few things that contributed to a living hell:<p>* I had zero salary (ALL my money came from expense claims) so I couldn't buy as much as a chocolate bar without running a stressful ""is-this-worth-the-cost-to-investors"" calculation in my head -- I couldn't internalize even a single dollar of ""cost"" to my own personal budget, and I <i>let</i> this stress me out because my co-founders were people I cared about. I felt like a child who had to ask his parents before buying anything.<p>* I lived in my office. And let me say that living alone out of an office in a foreign country with a nearly impenetrable culture and language is not the same as sharing an apartment in a hip city with your co-founder/friends.<p>* Decision-making was terribly slow -- it would take days to go back and forth b/w China and N. America on even the simplest issues. We totally underestimated the cost of this.<p>* My vesting period was undefined, and we had no official corporate paperwork, despite already having spent $100k+ on startup costs. I didn't realize this was a problem until I burnt out, and found that a simple conversation over dinner was all it took for me to be entirely out of the picture equity-wise.<p>* My other founder insisted on being the sole interface to the founder-investor. Which meant that information flow, despite being an extremely small startup, was already horribly distorted. There was already a chain of communication this long: Staff (6 people) > Project Manager > Me > Founder #2 > Founder-Investor. And the Founder-Investor was the only person who had any real experience in manufacturing, which was what we got ourselves into.<p>By the end, I had not even a <i>hint</i> of feeling like a responsible, independent <i>person</i>, let alone leader of a company. Every single aspect of my existence was, technically even if not practically, under the control of ""the company"" -- the food I ate, the office I lived in, the staff I hired... and I'd agreed to it all, in a trusting sort of way, because I didn't see that ""good people"" still require ""good structure"" in order to function properly. It was the <i>least</i> entrepreneurial position I've ever felt myself to be in, despite being the <i>most</i> entrepreneurial from a cursory glance.<p>Things would've been a lot smoother if I'd let my ""shrewd businessperson"" self take over initial discussions instead of my more natural ""trusting friend"" self, which left all the details to some nonexistent universal positive force of social goodness.",1206255886

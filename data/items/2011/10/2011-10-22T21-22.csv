It's just as likely that the basis of social hierarchy would shift even more towards connections, beauty, style and knowledge. And there would still be striving for limited resources; there are only so many people that this season's hottest media stars will sleep with, so many housebuilding plots available with a view of the Taj Mahal, a limited number of penthouses overlooking Central Park. Yes, you could live a physically comfortable life anywhere you choose, but admiration, acclaim, worship and respect would still have to be earned.<p>A society where almost everyone was living at the level where self-actualization was their primary concern would not be boring, even if it contained boring people.",1319320705
3144414,comment,3143789,3143789,22,0,lambada,,,"For anyone who hasn't used Tor before, I'm going to clarify some of the inaccuracies/FUD in the article.<p>- A darknet did not 'grow out' of the Tor software. The ability for anyone to host websites on their computer anonymously is a standard feature of the Tor network.<p>- Tor is not strictly a set of browser plugins. Tor is routing software that routes over TCP/IP. Any program can use it assuming they have set the proxy settings on their computer/program correctly. There is a plugin for Firefox, but the functionality of that is limited to one-click setup of the correct settings, and changing some default Firefox settings to increase anonymity and security.<p>- The site the article mentioned called 'Hard Candy' is a standard wiki page hosted on the Hidden Wiki. The purpose of the Hidden Wiki is to be a huge directory of all the sites on the Tor network, as search bots are impractical. As distasteful as it is, it would be impossible to enforce those links to be removed.<p>- As far as I'm aware Freedom Hosting never had a normally accessible domain name, so the article claiming things about WHOIS data is almsot certainly irrelevant.<p>EDIT: These are my own views, and not those of any other person/organisation. I have experience with the Tor network due to my pet interest in Anonymous networks, and how they function.",1319320682

3144384,comment,3144099,3144298,1,0,electromagnetic,,,"I think it's that so much of our orientation is dependent on peripheral vision. I know Canadas worst pile up was caused by a heavy fog. 87 vehicles piled up, they believe in a very short time from the fog rolling in. The main factor was speed, basically people were over driving their view distance. Visibility was estimated to be something like 50 meters, but driving at 110kph gives you a stopping distance of around 150 meters. What worsened the incident was that light fog generally reduces drivers speed, but heavy fog is known to increase speed as the lack of peripheral markers means people can't gauge their speed and too few drivers check their speedometer.<p>I'm sure a pilot in dense cloud has the potential to make a whole host of mistakes. First I'm sure without instrumentation a pilot would quickly lose gauge on how level they're flying, or second guess how level they're flying and try to adjust. If you get caught in a cloud with a very low ceiling, there's probably not much time between exiting the cloud and that ""Oh shit, that stuffs the ground"". Or a slight climb and not enough thrust could easily compromise your speed and put you into a stall.<p>I'm quite sure 3-dimensions of travel is a real bitch when you're blind and can't stop.",1319319421

3144345,comment,3144099,3144335,5,0,apaprocki,,,"I think a more robust model of N completely different systems (both mechanical and electrical) to compute the same variable could be found so that the probability that it is computing a value outside of x% of the actual real value is lower than the probability that the human could make a mistake. Even if a speed indicator model in the event of pitot tube loss had a 25% margin of error, autopilot could have done the right thing or it could have possibly influenced their decision to pull back.<p>EDIT: You can down-vote, but this is already the direction that cars have gone.

If you ask my opinion, communism was the most repulsive and despicable experiment in the history of mankind. Nazism was communism under a different name. The way people bonded with each other was through vile and resentful hate of the westernized upper class (communism) or the Jews and the British (nazism). Schoolteachers brainwashed children from the early age to become haters as well. Both were populist movements enabled by ""liminal"" conditions of post-WWI period and spearheaded by ruthless Machiavellian manipulators of public opinion who harnessed the newly emergent mass-media to appeal to the disgruntled poorly educated populace lacking a better leader. See any Dostoyevsky's novel where he portrays the character known as the ""Underground Man"" for a better background, as well as the following links: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#Imitation.2C_leadership.2C_and_the_role_of_the_trickster"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#Imitation.2C_leaders...</a>,

It's a false dichotomy. As PG wrote, money is not wealth. The way money works is that it makes you important in the eyes of a number of people. The way fame works is it makes you important in the eyes of a number of people as well, perhaps a different <i>kind</i> of people, but the underlying logic is the same. It's not one against the other, and whoever ardently defends that idea carries an agenda. Ultimately both money and fame are tokens for power. If you were infinitely powerful, you would need neither.",1319317746
3144338,comment,3144099,3144323,1,0,apaprocki,,,"Another trick might be using star alignment. A fixed position camera on the top of the plane could sense pitch by tracking which stars are in view. Or similarly, if you boxed a sensitive GPS receiver so that it could not detect signals from the sides, the satellite IDs which are in view could possibly indicate alignment of the plane as well. The best model would tie in as many observations as possible to maximize the probability that it is right.<p>EDIT: What about fuel sensors in the wing? If the computer knew the volume of the remaining fuel and the altitude was not dropping, it could determine the orientation of the plane if there were sensors inside the tanks to detect which were submerged.",1319317700

3144326,comment,3144099,3144304,1,0,apaprocki,,,"I was going to suggest this in my post. A ""dead-man""'s limit. A plane would lock you out and right itself it detected you dropped below some pre-defined altitude (e.g. within an acceptable angle without landing gear deployed or a greater than acceptable angle with or without landing gear deployed). Whatever altitude is necessary for the plane to right itself from the steepest descent. Something like that would make it impossible for someone to storm a cockpit and nose-dive a plane. It would need appropriate remote electronic <i>and</i> mechanical overrides, though to prevent possibly losing a plane if it was triggered incorrectly. But at least a plane flying level on lockout autopilot would buy some time opposed to it definitely being destroyed by the nose-dive.",1319317357

So they're comparing exposed users to only-slightly-more exposed users (as I mention above, cell phones were rare and had quite expensive per-minute fees before 1995).  They only know that <i>most</i> in the control group didn't have a mobile before 1995.  Since then, they don't know how long any user in either group has used their mobile.<p>- During the period for which they have data (pre-1996) 30% of users were on corporate plans and couldn't be tracked--so the heaviest users were lumped in with the control group too.<p>- The 1987-1995 group mostly used analog phones, not today's GSM phones.<p>Still, earlier phone users have used their phones <i>slightly</i> more than non-users in aggregate, so this study is noteworthy despite the lumping of the 30% heaviest users with the controls and the massive cell phone use by both groups since 1995.  You'd expect cancer rate to correlate with mobile phone exposure, and both groups are very large.",1319317204

Example of sources: the OS using /dev/urandom, or the language using a secure random class, etc.<p>XID is compatible with UUID-size-fields in Postgres and any other 128-bit storage system, if you want to save them. The XID idea is quite easy to implement on any system because it&#x27;s always calling good built-in random tools, rather than trying to home-grow some kind of hash or SHA or masking.<p>The primary advantage is that naming something an XID tells programmers that it&#x27;s important to use it as intended. Calling a field an XID means: do not use fewer bits, do not use a less-secure randomness source, do not use an UUID library that sets any of the bytes, etc.<p>If you would like to contribute XID code for any language, we welcome commits.",1448160548

10608875,comment,10606226,10608791,0,0,userbinator,,,"It was a long time ago, but I remember we were working on an embedded system controlling some industrial equipment, and it randomly crashed; the time between crashes was long enough that it&#x27;d take several days before it happened, so even getting a trace of the crash was an exercise in patience. Eventually we did get a trace, and it turned out the CPU would suddenly start fetching instructions and executing from a completely unexpected address, despite no interrupts or other things that might cause it. We collected several more traces (took around a month, because of its rarity) and the addresses at which it occurred, and the address it jumped to, were different every time. Replacing the CPU with a new one didn&#x27;t fix it, and looking at the bus signals with an oscilloscope showed nothing unusual - everything was within spec. We asked the manufacturer and they were just as mystified and said it couldn&#x27;t happen, so we resorted to implementing a workaround that involved resetting the system daily. Around a year after that, the CPU manufacturer released a new revision, and one of the errata it fixed was something like &quot;certain sequences of instructions may rarely result in sudden arbitrary control transfer&quot; - so we replaced the CPU with the new revision, and the problem disappeared. We never did find out what exactly was wrong with the first revision, other than the fact that it was silicon bug.",1448160473

I think it shouldn't be, and just like there is collateral damage in a real war there will be collateral damage in a war that centers around information.<p>I don't think that such a change could be effected without it.<p>No matter how much you would redact, you could always argue that someone is at risk because of releasing information on current ops.<p>Ask Valerie Plame what it feels like when information is leaked to serve opportunistic goals, and that was the government doing the leaking, with the express purpose of harming an individual, not exactly to promote a society without secrets.<p>Really, if anything, I think wikileaks should not even have attempted to redact anything, just like a common carrier they should have passed it on verbatim, by attempting to redact they assume some responsibility, which they could have avoided by not redacting at all.<p>I understand that that may offend your sensibilities because 'peoples lives are at risk' but that's just a variation on the 'think of the children' argument.<p>War is ugly, releasing information about a war that is in progress is going to be ugly too, I can't see how it could even be different if you decided to do that.",1285707439

1737285,comment,1735215,1735215,0,0,joeld42,,,"Names are really important. This is a bad name.<p>Gimp, the image editor, is another victim of OSS naming. I know many serious artists who won't give it a try simply because of the name. They don't take it seriously. The fact that it's free is unimportant to them. With a better name a decade ago, Gimp could be a serious competitor to Photoshop now, instead of a footnote.<p>In this case, the developers are putting a clumsy emphasis on the price and ""freedom"", which is unimportant to someone who just wants to write a letter or make a presentation.<p>Read ""LibreOffice"" literally .. ""A free alternative to MS Office"". Which is not untrue but this immediately raises the question ""Can you afford the REAL MS Office? And are you worth it?"" Most people will answer, ""Yes, I can and I am certainly worth it"". Starving students may answer ""No, but it's less work to pirate it than to install this weird thing.""<p>My belief is that for an OSS office suite to dethrone MS Office, it needs a clear focus, and one other than ""free"".<p>Brainstorming some directions they could have taken:<p>LessOffice - A streamlined office suite, fast and bloat-free, that never crashes. (Of course, OpenOffice is pretty far from this in reality)<p>CopyDesk - A word processor for writers, not for bureaucrats.<p>DeFacto - An office suite that interoperates seamlessly with every other system. It never asks what format something is in, it just works.<p>BloatOffice - Has every feature from every other office suite. Combined. The most complete office suite on the planet. (A bit self-deprecating, but could turn a perceived weakness, bloat, into a feature, completeness).<p>Folio - An office suite without the learning curve.<p>In any case, this market is long overdue to be disrupted. Google Docs isn't going to do it. I'm a writer, and I can't even get it to do proper manuscript format. A typewriter can do that.<p>Developers: If you REALLY want to help the free software movement break MS's stranglehold on Office, don't write another office suite. Write a self-contained, standalone library that reads and writes .doc files, that works perfectly for the features it supports and clearly indicates to the caller when it's going to break and what it's breaking on. Once you can write a 200 line example program that converts most docs to nearly identical .pdfs, you've won. Not that that's easy.",1285707402

Indeed, the entire Bonjour system and file sharing is so annoying and cumbersome.  Finder can see the other computer, but it can't actually go there, even when they are sitting next to each other.<p>Then you have iTunes.  iTunes loves to create duplicate music files.  The best part is, when I tell iTunes ""Yes, control the management of my music"" I suddenly end up with three copies of every song.  Then there is the disappearing devices.  Why, my iPhone/iPad/AppleTV where there a minute ago.  My iPad/iPhone are still plugged in.  Why can't I access them anymore?<p>Then their is iPhoto.  Which controls movies.  And photos.  Sort of.  Movies!?   In iPhoto?  iMovie uses iPhoto to import movies?  And then outputting movies is so confusing.  So many different options, and then you can't just have iTunes pick it up, you have to load up iTunes, tell it to import the movie, and going through numerous other steps to get it onto your Apple TV.<p>But back to iPhoto.  You ever create a slide show with iPhoto?  I did.  iPhoto is the only application I know that showed me a preview of the movie it was going to create, and then the output changed the complete order of the pictures.  How does this happen?<p>Let's not forget the harassment iPhoto inflicts on users by default whenever you plug anything in.  It snatches focus away, loads up, just to import.  Oh, sure, you can set your iPhone to import quietly, but even having done it, I forget where the setting is buried.<p>And then there is the default way you install software.  Now, I know, it's simple enough, right?  No, it's annoying.  I have to drag an icon into a folder? And then I have to dig through that folder and find a generic icon just to find the application, and then launch it.  Why not just let me click a button to install, and then be like ""Hey, you <i>just</i> installed this app, which means, you probably want to run it, well, do you?""<p>And that's just the beginning.

This is not necessarily better design, but it is the currently fashionable design. I would argue that the single button interface on the iPhone/iPad is an example of moving too far towards minimalism (from a purely functional perspective). The same button now performs different functions depending on how many times you press it and where you are when you press it, yet there is plenty of room for a second button.<p>- In my opinion, Apple's software is a mixed bag. I love the user experience in iOS, and OSX is my favorite desktop operating system, but I think iTunes is among the worst commonly used desktop applications available.<p>- All of these devices will be judged on categories beyond hardware/software in the future. For example, I expect a phone's ability to connect with important services to become increasingly scrutinized. It seems like it will only be a matter of time before we're all using something like Google Voice to manage our phone numbers. A device's ability to interface with these types of critical services could very easily become the killer app.<p>- A small point, but I think the comparison between a MacBook Pro an a Lenovo is a bit odd.

Other wise, use of black should be done carefully. One of the things that pure black does in a coloured piece of art (ignoring grey scale and almost greyscale) is automatically flatten the image. You'll notice that most Chinese brush paintings actually use diluted black ink. The fact that many of them are basically greyscale or monochromatic just means they can get away with more black.<p>Also, mixing in pure black into paint to darken a colour will almost always result in crappy looking shadows.

He was quoting VC's who had said that.<p><i>There’s a worry among venture capitalists, [Arrington] said, that angels are training “an entire generation of entrepreneurs who are building dipshit companies” that sell to Google for $25 million. In fact, that criticism might be extended to Y Combinator as well, which could be seen as “the king of the dipshit companies.”<p>Arrington said he isn’t on-board with all of that criticism, but that it holds a “kernel of truth.”</i><p><a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2010/07/29/angelconf-ron-conway-michael-arrington/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2010/07/29/angelconf-ron-conway-micha...</a>",1285704290

Allowing your thoughts of ""unfairness"" affect your motivation is counter-productive.<p>Yes, you need to choose co-founders very carefully.  Find people you can trust: I speak from (painful) experience.<p>Yes, to be successful you need to do the best you can and not worry about who deserves what.<p>Now, that being said: the best solution to all of this is communication-- preferably in advance.  Sit down, say, once a week, and talk about what the priorities are for each of you for the coming week, and what you expect to accomplish.  If everybody is on the same page in terms of priorities and expectations, the other problems are minor.  The weekly meetings server two purposes: 1) if there are slippages between what is expected and what is happening, it's best to be able to deal with those quickly (i.e., within a week) rather than let the pressure/dissatisfaction build, and 2) once you've agreed to what your co-founders are planning to do during the week, you don't have to think about it again until the next meeting-- you can give your expectations and comparisons a rest.",1285704288

It is possible, though more difficult, to design pages that accommodate resolutions as low as 1024 x Y, but that also expand to fit higher resolutions.

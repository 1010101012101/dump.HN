Its priced at $1799 without SSD and I mean that isn't outrageous or anything considering its a decent laptop with Mac's flagship OS (which I would never call bad, only overpriced) and a solidly beautiful design. Perhaps its not worth every penny, but its definitely an ok value.<p>Now as for the SSD version...I'd have to rethink that a bit.<p>And of course, normal people buy solid computers that fit their need without that extra oomph to the form factor, probably for a cool $1000 or less. And they install linux to save money if they're smart ;)",1202322242

There is stored energy all over the place, but we weren't there to see it get stored, so it's like it came from thin air.<p>Energy just comes up out of the ground, as trees or coal or oil or uranium, and we use it, and when we need more we just do more digging or chopping!<p>Geologic time is an alien concept for humans, far more alien than anything ever shown on <i>Star Trek</i>. Even those of us with lots of science education have trouble grasping it. It's really quite hard to look at an oil field and think of it as the accumulation of millions of years' worth of solar energy. It's like trying to remember that you are one of <i>seven billion</i> people in the world: that number is so much larger than the number of your friends that you can't really understand it.",1202322131

Since people are used to downloading it, I've been considering releasing a wrapped version, but I'd love to see any anecdotes that people might have in working with any of the engines.",1202321970
110382,comment,110143,110143,0,0,gojomo,,,"Though he doesn't mention which Java version he's using, nowadays some core bundled facilities can make such diagnoses a lot quicker. 'jmap -histo' give you instance counts by class in a running JVM -- so over a period of unexpected memory retention, or the period just before an OOME, you can identify supspiciously overrepresented types. A binary heap dump and then browse with the 'jhat' tool can backtrace the exact reference chains causing objects to be retained. -- especially if you have the luxury of debugging a 16MB heap, rather than (say) a 2+GB heap.<p>The really annoying OOMEs in my experience are those that aren't really object heap exhaustion -- but other depletions that still get reported as OOME. Sometimes, increasing your object heap makes these worse (eg by allowing less space for non-heap JVM structures). At least starting in Java 6, these ""other OOMEs"" tend to have different messages.",1202321951

When these devices came out, they were not exactly the coolest things. Only Doctors and lawyers could afford them, and only they had any real use for the devices. I mean really? Who needs some bulky cell phone or pager with them when pay phones are everywhere? Of course we know how this story ends today. Cell phones are everywhere, and used by everyone.

Are these tech-savvy people getting excited when you tell them what your chat application can do for them -- or are they getting excited when you tell them how your chat application will work?<p>One of the common faults of hackers is that we tend to get excited about new technologies, and we'll often decide that a piece of software is ""cool"" because it uses ""cool"" technology (I'm reminded of recent discussions concerning Amazon's SimpleDB service and Erlang -- for many hackers, whether SimpleDB used Erlang was far more important than whether it was actually <i>useful</i>).<p>When presenting ideas to potential users, you should never mention <i>how</i> your idea will work; instead, present <i>what</i> it will do for them.  When presenting to people who won't understand the technical details, this is easy; it requires far more willpower when dealing with a technically minded audience.",1202321251
110375,comment,110031,110213,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This is a fun way to approach the paradox of perpetual motion: if we had a machine to generate energy from nothing, (or to magically teleport unlimited amounts of energy from Alpha Centauri, or whatever) we'd soon fill up our Earth with lots of extra matter (matter=energy, don'tcha know), and eventually the planet would collapse into a black hole!<p>Or, much more likely, we'd heat the Earth up enough that we could successfully radiate the excess energy out into space. Al Gore would not like that plan one bit.<p>Of course, while you're violating the second law of thermodynamics, I suppose you could always build a second machine that takes the exhaust heat from your perpetual-motion-powered cars and planes and sends it back to wherever it came from.",1202321207

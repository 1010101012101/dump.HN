Like relay with visible moving parts, or voltmeter with moving coil/pointer, or oscilloscope, or a resistor that heats up and that you can touch, or a capacitor that makes a noisy spark when discharged. And on the opposite, digital components that were not giving any direct visual/sensory clues were a lot more difficult to understand (like 555).<p>So, I guess, these extra visualizations can be really helpful at early stages.<p>With more abstract concepts, like modulated wave, detector radio, etc (which BTW can be understood at 5 as well) I don't think that visualizations like these can help.

That includes the company name, the design of the product (and overall design language) and the kind of marketing that you do.<p>One thing I disagree on is the name choice in the case of August. Customers face so much input and distractions that I wouldn't advise anyone to name their company in a mysterious way that will provoke any kind of curiosity in the customer. Most will just skip your product. This one time it works because of the guy behind the company and the coverage he's getting, but I wouldn't count on this branding working outside of the tech circle and the early adopters which constituted the 10k of orders. The design is very good though, while Lockitron's is the definition of lazy design (just copy an Apple design and be done).<p>I particularly liked the author's comparison between GoPro and Contour. I admire GoPro's branding. The name is perfect (it creates the association between buying the product and becoming a pro, which is brilliant), the marketing is perfect and even the product packaging and store display is perfect.

And there are some problems with the Newton's Third Law when you consider the electromagnetic field. Anyway the general idea of force-reaction still holds, so it's a good approximation for this experiment. If the tip ""see"" the molecule, then the molecule ""see"" the tip.<p>The problem with your explanation is that the probe is much much bigger than 1 atom. It's a whole macroscopic tip, with a mass of a few grams. The tip of the tip use a single CO molecule, so the prove ends in a single atom, but the atom is attached to a big structure. If the tip were thicker, they would measure an average of the surface under the tip, with a very sharp tip they measure a small area.<p>The molecules are attached to a silver surface, so they are relatively fixed. The O atom in the CO molecule in the tip is approached to measure the force at each point of the surface. I couldn't find the exact distance but Wikipedia says that in similar experiments the distance is between 10A and 100A. For comparison, a bound between two Carbons in a molecule is approximately 1.5A. So the CO molecule is far away and the force is very small (in the absolute and the relative sense), and the system must use an incredible amount of amplification.<p>But the force in the sample molecule is also relatively small, so it isn't disturbed too much, and the data that you get are very similar to the data of the unperturbed molecule.<p>I suppose that it's possible to tweak the setting to decrease the distance so the interaction between the molecule in the tip and the sample molecule is smaller. I suppose that it's possible to use this to make some reactions happen, but I don't remember an experiment with this phenomenon. Anyway a usual problem is to crash the tip against the surface. It's bad for the tip, you need to pick another CO molecule and if it hit the sample molecule it could be interesting. With a similar microscope that use the tunnel effect it's possible to move atoms from one place to another, so it's possible to do things on the surface using the correct settings. You can even do a movie! <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5637150"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5637150</a>",1370045913

It was brutally hot out and dry as hell, but the sand was so cool you could have sworn there was an ice-rink under it or something.  Even weirder though, it hurt to stare directly at the sand for too long since it reflected sunlight so well.  I expect that you could probably get snow-blindness from staring at it for too long.<p>It felt like being in a field of gritty snow inside of an oven.",1370045874

Each forked process has the entire memory footprint of the Rails app (about 200-250 MB for us), so the more memory you have the more forked processes you can run on a single dyno.<p>This reduces H12 errors because the more concurrency you have in a single process the less likely it is that Heroku's random routing layer is going to send a request to a dyno that is unable to handle the request because it's busy handling another long running request. As long as long running requests are the exception and not the rule, this should solve the problem.",1370045249

QA can make or break a company, and depending on your skill level, should be treated as peers with other disciplines.\nI know that I came to the industry with more knowledge than many of my QA peers, but what was often overlooked was where I was sometimes more knowledgeable than most of the Devs and PMs I worked alongside.\nI am a consultant today, and after 10 years of hard work, have demonstrated my capabilities in other roles, but it has been very difficult to find the right projects to bring these other skills to light. For the past 3 or 4 years, I've been working in Dev and PM capacities, but my inbox is still filled with recruiters that only see me as possessing QA abilities; this is because finding highly skilled and qualified SDETs, or even STEs, is hard.\nAs long as QA work is regarded as starting in the mail room, this won't change and the good QA employees, like moths to the flame, will leave those roles to less qualified workers. This practice perpetuates the idea that QA is only entry level work and drains the talent pool. As a result, software development suffers.",1370045134

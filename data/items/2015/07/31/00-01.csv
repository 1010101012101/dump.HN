I&#x27;ve seen several drivers look up from their phones and, startled to see a green light, gun the engine to get into the intersection.  All this without looking to see if someone is coming through late or if an emergency vehicle is approaching or anything.<p>I&#x27;m glad these officers are handing out tickets.",1438304393
9979331,comment,9953767,9954375,0,0,lotharrr,,,"There are two useful things (IMHO) in magic-wormhole. The first is the PAKE-based security model, with the invitation codes. The second is the &quot;try to find each other&quot; STUN-fallback transit stuff. Transit is way less interesting than PAKE, but by combining the two, you get a tool that&#x27;s about as simple as it could possibly get while still being secure.<p>magic-wormhole always uses a baked-in rendezvous server (which I run) for exchanging PAKE messages, and frequently uses a baked-in transit server (which I also run) for the bulk data of file transfer. If one of the two sides has a public IP address or they&#x27;re both on the same subnet, the file transfer runs directly, without my transit server. My transit server is effectively a STUN server.<p>I have a list of alternative approaches to explore (use the BitTorrent DHT, use Tor hidden services, use IP multicast groups, local MDNS, IPFS), which may do one or more of the following:<p>* reduce the single-point-of-failure -ness\n* reduce the exposure of IP addresses\n* increase the exposure of IP addresses\n* reduce the load on my server\n* speed things up\n* slow things down<p>Compared to scp: to get proper (i.e. non-password) security out of ssh/scp (and rsync on top of them), you must have previously copied a public key to the target machine, which requires e.g. reading the string to someone sitting next to you and having them type it in, or publishing the key somewhere that can be reached by something you read to them and then visually comparing what they got with what you meant to publish. (at least for the initial contact; once you&#x27;ve set up the keys, then future transfers are trivially easy). Plus the target must be reachable by TCP.<p>For magic-wormhole, you still have to read something to them, but it&#x27;s really short and designed specifically to be transcribed aloud. And the two sides don&#x27;t need TCP reachability.<p>I figured that almost every form of file transfer involves either the sender telling some reference string to the recipient (like a URL of some sort), or the recipient telling some destination reference string to the sender (an email address), followed by a bunch of other work that&#x27;s annoying and reduces security. Magic-wormhole requires the same &quot;read something to the recipient&quot; part, but removes the setup phase, and removes all the security-losing middlemen.",1438304371

9979319,comment,9977342,9977342,0,0,stvswn,,,"Some additional context from wikipedia: the island was originally 100% uninhabited in the 19th century when the French brought slaves there.  Over the course of the next century, it was mostly privately owned, and the majority of residents were employees of plantations who were under temporary contracts and would return to Mauritania or the Seychelles after the contract was over.  Ever since the slave days, there was a creole population, and that&#x27;s the relevant group -- they were not indigenous peoples, but rather freed slaves and their descendants living on private land. In the 1970s, about 1100 people were forcibly removed after the British government took control of the island for the US naval base.  They were compensated in cash.  I think it&#x27;s absolutely reasonable to feel like this was a dirty land grab, but whether they were really permanent residents, and how many they were, is in dispute.  This sort of falls in the category of eminent domain seizures.  I generally have a problem with those, but I don&#x27;t spend too much time dwelling on the displaced populations that resulted from other government land seizures.  Should we all feel guilty when we visit national parks?  Or when we drive on highways? Or for the many military bases throughout the US?  Do you think they just happened to find land with exactly zero residents?",1438304125

9979292,comment,9977067,9978805,0,0,nbadg,,,"I agree that hash-based addressing creates a bit of a chicken-and-the-egg problem for content discovery, with the exception of, for example, existing links or QR codes. You&#x27;ll always need some way of looking up the hash for the content you&#x27;re hoping to find. But that lookup mechanism need not be a single centralized service. In fact, I would make the argument that in many cases, search engines are doing exactly this right now: you have several coexisting, competing, but centralized services, and a user is free to choose between them. It&#x27;s centralization, sure, but in a much more robust way (though it admittedly could be significantly improved through, for example, a common search API). The only difference is that contemporary search engines are looking up URLs instead of hashes, but given how we&#x27;re using URLs these days (ex: <a href=""https://imgur.com/iauyhdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/iauyhdf</a>), I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big distinction.<p>You&#x27;re also spot-on that dynamic content is the hardest part of hash-based addressing, but the problem is a bit more nuanced IMO. On the one hand, all content, once created, is static. If a thermometer reads 32.8 at 15:40 on 30 July 2015, that data point is fixed in time, immutable. However, we humans think of things far more conceptually, and we build cognitive connections between things. All content is static, but all concepts are dynamic. So the question is then, how do you reconcile those two?<p>The best answer I&#x27;ve personally come across is bindings -- exactly analogous to binding names to variables in Python. Some hash bindings would be static, some bindings dynamic. That also allows you to construct more complicated objects like buffers natively. That&#x27;s how I&#x27;m doing it in the project I&#x27;m working on (<a href=""https://github.com/Muterra/doc-muse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Muterra/doc-muse</a>), though the bindings are a relatively new addition that I haven&#x27;t had time to test yet (or update the documentation, for that matter).",1438303728

My friend once had an idea when the two of us were more interested in free software advocacy.  He put a big &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; sticker on his laptop and ran a fairly flashy setup of Compiz (the flashiest thing around at the time).  Then he just went to bars and cafes to chill out and hack.<p>Interested people would often ask him what his computer was because it was obviously different than anything else they had seen.  At that point it was fairly easy to see if the person had any interest in software freedom.  I seem to remember he used to carry around those Ubuntu CDs that Canonical gave out for this purpose as well.  At worst he would give them a CD and say, &quot;Give it a shot.  You may like it or not.&quot;<p>The thing is that quite a few people, even if they aren&#x27;t technical, have an interest in software freedom once they know what it is.  Many of the people who approached him did so because they were frustrated by companies dictating what they could and could not do with their computers.  They were looking for choices.  The killer feature to demonstrate was the package manager of all things.<p>Of course choice comes at a cost.  It was important to stress to people that the cost of using the choice was spending time learning and fiddling.  The people who approached my friend were often the type of people who were quite happy with this trade-off.<p>Later, when I worked in a high school in Japan teaching English, I used to hang out late at night hacking on my computer (I had no heat/cooling in my apartment so the school was the best place to hack :-) ).  Many of the other teachers would see me working on my laptop and ask me about it.  GNU/Linux is practically unknown to the mainstream in Japan as far as I can tell, so it was always an interesting conversation.  After the school board dictated a change from MS office to Open Office (which I had been using throughout anyway), several of the teachers installed Ubuntu on their personal machines.  To be honest, for the kinds of things they did, it just worked better.<p>I think that this kind of passive advocacy is probably going to be the most effective.  I think many people here would be surprised at the level of resonance that free software has with normal people on the street (once they understand what it is).  But it is best to narrow your target to those people who are interested unless you just want to hear endless stories of &quot;I tried Linux and it didn&#x27;t work LOL&quot;.",1438303160

Picking the right investment fund might also be hard, but placing my savings under the management of a relative stranger feels very uncomfortable.<p>In a world where Bernie Madoff existed, it&#x27;d be almost irresponsible to invest retirement savings with a startup.  That being said, WealthFront and Betterment are basically startups, but they seem to be at a different level of maturity.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not sure how objective my perception is.  Would a more credible looking website be all the difference?",1438300925

This is information that can be cross-referenced against inspection of the remains. If they know that Robert Hunt was a 39 year old male, and there&#x27;s four skeletons, they just have to find the skeleton that&#x27;s probably a 39 year old male and that&#x27;s Robert Hunt.",1438300912

You should be able to upgrade to 800 GB bandwidth for about $80 to $120 a month.  Though of course you'd want to get a dedicated server with that kind of traffic, it takes some time to research another web host, sign up, check them out, try them out at different times of day, upload some stuff, wait for the dns to propogate, and more.  So, you want a host that lets you upgrade to an account with more bandwidth the same day you request it.<p>Hosts that have a $5 plan, an $8 plan, and a $12 plan as their highest, I would avoid.  Hosts that have a $20 plan for 300GB, $60 for $500, and $80 for 800GB, I would think actually plan on their users using their bandwidth.<p>I signed up for KnownHost.com just now, who have the best uptime AND 38 servers with who knows how many VPS accounts on each one, and they have immediate e-mail support and a very fast VPS.  I am going to have to switch to something else that has ruby on rails preinstalled because neither I nor the tech could figure it out, even after trying 6 different installation instructions, removing cpanel, with cpanel, etc.",1178409011

Most people who like jazz are also rather proud that they like it.  <p>I suspect you'd also find more Europeans than Americans are fans of Beuys, or Lacan, or <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>, or other such things that might have been created as controls in experiments to measure pretentiousness.",1178406395

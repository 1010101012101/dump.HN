Everyone in the banking industry knew that 2008/2009/2010 were going to be bad years so bonus expectations were low. Bankers/traders find loopholes and opportunities in systems (stock market, real estate, etc.) and exploit them for profit. Of course any poorly orchestrated bailout was going to end in this.",1423486730

Generally, the only source for it is the French university that created/promotes it [0]. But even their pages are often almost a decade old and I have frequently found errors in the documentation.<p>Overall, while OCaml is a truly beautiful language (and I do really enjoy writing in it[1]), it is really tough to get work done efficiently because so few resources seem to exist.<p>With that said, I discovered a mod_ocaml Apache module implementation[2] (that is really outdated and not very efficient) and moved it to github. (I am not the author, nor have I had time to work on it either.) But if there was any interest in reviving this, I&#x27;d certainly give it a go. This seems to be a potentially viable way to increase interest in server-side OCaml usage.<p>[0] <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/index.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/index.en.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/eatonphil/owebl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/eatonphil/owebl</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/eatonphil/mod_ocaml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/eatonphil/mod_ocaml</a>",1423486516
9020893,comment,9020318,9020663,0,0,wereHamster,,,"Avers supports only two operations, <i>set</i> and <i>splice</i>. It is very simple to implement in any language. My backend is written in Haskell. The code dealing with applying the patches is about 200 lines.<p>With these two operations you can edit arbitrary data structures. The user experience may not be the best, for example if two people edit the same text, because if you only have set then latest change wins. But maybe your data structures are not text heavy. Or they have many small text fields where the &#x27;latest change wins&#x27; semantic is actually desireable.<p>At my previous company we also used and OT based patch system. And we didn&#x27;t have text-editing support, we only had an equivalent to <i>set</i> in Avers. And it worked alright. Which operations you need depends on the application, ShareJS is good for one particular type, but too complex (or maybe even lacking) for others.<p>As for maps and sets, see <a href=""http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/</a> how good the support is.

For example, luxury goods should be taxed higher and basic staples very low to none. This the wealthy could not avoid tax by simply shifting money around political jurisdictions. This system would encourage transparency, encourage wealth creation as well as thrift in lower and middle income earners.<p>Also, a side benefit (not that I entirely agree with it) is this is a way to enforce social policy like healthy eating. Tax unhealthy items like sugary food and tobacco highly (up to a point). This is done already in the United States successfully. And if you want more tube riders and less drivers in a city, have a very high toll and vehicle purchase tax. Singapore does this successfully.<p>Some countries that have no income tax already employ this to an extent by taxing certain sales and imports. I think this type of system is worth experimenting with at least on the city-state or state level (canton / province / state). If it does not work, you can always go back.<p>There&#x27;s been talk of this type of system in the US but it&#x27;s not likely to gain traction. The real reason for progressive income tax is not good policy, but divide and conquer class politics.

Slow usb2 i/o and no SATA ports won&#x27;t be able to compete against low-end development boards (SolidRun HummingBoard or Radxa Rock Pro). \nWhile 64bit 8core ARM is something interesting, the low i/o speeds and ports rather limit any &quot;computational&quot; usage.<p>Finally, the main reason not to build products out of the variety of ARM development boards is IMHO the missing CE/FCC certification for retail products. Afaik every board including the Raspberry PIs are only for demo/lab purposes. So if you build some embedded server product you&#x27;ll do have the bureaucracy and costs. At least they should offer 2-3 FCC/CE ready combinations of boards+cases ready to be deployed in the wild.<p>In my eyes those boards are just an replacement for the Texas Instruments PandaBoards which are discontinued because TI gave up their OMAP business a while ago and the typical low-cost board makers are using cheap dual/quad-core 32bit A8 and A9 IP.",1423484199

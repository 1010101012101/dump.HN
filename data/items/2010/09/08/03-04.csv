It's probably always better to do it incrementally even if it takes twice as long to do so, because you can maintain working software and fix bugs as you go.<p>The approach I would take is to get the minimum set of engineers who know the most about each major aspect of the code, and put their heads together on what the ideal architecture would be.  But rather than building it from scratch, figure out how to implement just one of those pieces now.  That way you can decrease entropy in the codebase piecemeal without chucking out all the code at once, which is no doubt full of forgotten assumptions that no one will remember until it's too late.",1283917022

As far as accessing stuff out of memcached is concerned, there's no reason that can't also be deferred to the view.<p>Claiming that lazy loaded queries is only a benefit for ""trival cases"" is a strawman.  It's a hugely powerful functionality for ActiveRecord that you can utilize in many ways, and would be very hard to implement without low level support.<p>Cached attributes can often easily be made available via concise single model methods that operate transparently without the controller OR the view needing to know they are cache-backed.  Plus, even if you are loading stuff out of memcached in the controller, it's going to be fast, because that's the whole point of memcached.<p>ActiveRecord meanwhile, normally takes a huge percentage of rendering time.  Being able to defer those queries while still allowing the controller to declare them is actually a huge combination of performance flexibility and separation of concerns.  Previously, if you wanted to defer them ""cleanly"", you'd have to create model methods, but even there you would have to pass params through somehow or generally do something uglier than what you have to do now.",1283915931

Strength training requires muscles to contract tightly against a heavy weight, and loosening the muscle fibres by stretching them first reduces their ability to do this. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t warm your muscles up before strength training – just avoid stretching them first. If you want to include stretching in the same workout as strength training, it’s better to wait until after you’ve finished your weights work.</i><p>I typically warm up on the elliptical machine for 5 minutes and then for each muscle group I'm doing that day I start with a set of low weight/high reps to warm it up.

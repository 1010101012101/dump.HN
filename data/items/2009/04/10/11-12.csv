555933,comment,555635,555693,0,0,axod,,,">> ""Its usefulness is blatantly obvious""<p>Please explain for me. I have an iPhone for portability, I have a laptop for semi portability. I have a mac mini for watching movies etc.<p>I can't think of how a tablet device like that would be useful. It's sort of too big and delicate to take traveling - nothing to protect the screen, so a laptop or netbook wins there.<p>The only use I can imagine is having it in the kitchen on the wall to look up recipes :/<p>Perhaps ""the industry hasn't been able to do this"" because there's not a proven market there. Further, there have been several tablet type laptops with flimsy swively screens, most of which seem total failures.<p>I can completely see geeks buying this. But that's a small market and one which I don't think you can make a lot of money from.<p>Also could the packaging <i>be</i> any more copied from Apple packaging?",1239364235

555924,comment,555691,555691,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"Greene's books are interesting because they are Machiavellian: a mixture of amoral observation of what is, satirical recommendations and, vice versa, inexplicit  instruction on what to watch out for other people doing to you.<p>And in A and C they are extremely valuable, and all worth owning and reading. And the advice does sometimes make sense -- it's written in the extreme to provoke, but sometimes life is so contradictory that doing ""bad"" things tempered with a good intention works out to positive in the final balance.",1239363224

To me, it's far less distracting to read than ""he/she"" or ""(s)he."" I personally prefer the singular ""they"" as a gender neutral pronoun, but some people think it's improper English.<p>Either way, I don't think that using ""she"" as a gender neutral pronoun can be considered distracting advocacy of feminism.",1322413121

Try it on 90% of the worlds machines, ""it just works"". In other words, demanding perfect support.<p>> Don't you know that piracy happens mostly because there is no other convenient way to get the content. I'd be happy to give them my money, but there is no way for me to do so.<p>There are plenty of ways, you are just too much of a stubborn snob to utilize any of them. I fully agree with this argument when there actually is a barrier to entry, but you are just building them instead.<p>> Maybe you think that it's good business practice to tell 10% of the potential customer to go fuck themselves, I don't.<p>I do. When they are as picky and demanding as you, in the long run typically they'll cause you more support headaches. Their 10% isn't worth the 20% you lose overall when dealing with their over the top demands.<p>> I'm not sorry about having ethics and refusing to use paypal or for not wanting google to track me more than they already do by not using their online payment services, it's simply good privacy practice.<p>Then be ready to repeat this experience with most things on the internet. Your Monopoly money is unproven and highly unstable, only those that haven't thought it through very well or are desperate for cash from security nuts are willing to accept it, and even then they would rather take real currency if you've got it.<p>> Actually they do offer flac which is among why I'm interested in this in the first place<p>They didn't when I posted my comment.<p>> I simply don't buy mp3.<p>You didn't have to tell me that, it was clear from your original comment that you would never allow anything but FLAC to tarnish your precious ears.

It seems to make some sense - it'll weed out the people who aren't truly interested in starting a business, because it'll be harder than in 'normal' economic times.<p>The difference is, for web/tech startups, it's probably <i>easier</i> now to get started, insomuch as the cost of starting something is far less than it was 5 years ago, and there's more money being invested in small web startups than a few years ago.  So... lower costs to startup, more money being invested, and we see more of these happening.<p>However, people think they're ""starting a business in a recession"" because the general economy is in recession.  The ""web/tech startup"" economy is <i>not</i> in recession - seemingly quite the opposite, really.<p>In a year or two when the startup money stops flowing so easily, we'll be in 'startup recession' territory, and that's where the ""start a business in a recession"" wisdom will be tested, but I suspect not as many people will put it to the test.",1322411799

3282675,comment,3282160,3282160,2,0,steve8918,,,"Reading the comments below, it completely sounds like the Housing Bubble discussions between 2004 and 2008.  You had the doomsayers saying for years that ""house prices are too expensive, there's going to be a crash"" and the momentum chasers saying ""no, this time it's different, there's not enough land, house prices are here to stay.""<p>In the comments, you have the same sentiment of ""It's too frothy, there has to be a pullback"", or ""There won't be a pullback, this time it's different than 2008.""<p>After surviving the dotcom crash and the 2008 financial crash, it definitely seems like we are headed towards a global recession in 2012.  No matter what path we take, whether Europe can save itself or not, the best case scenario is going to be a sharp pullback in European economic output.  Worst case is that the euro falls apart and the entire global financial system is rocked.  My guess is that Germany won't allow this to happen because they will suffer disproportionately, so they will allow the issuing of Eurobonds.<p>So that being said, economic growth will slowdown worldwide.  I think the US is the best place to be, given its sluggish-but-not-catastrophic growth.<p>BUT it's not the US's GDP that matters, it's the investments of American rich people that matters in terms of funding VCs.  If rich people take a hit because a majority of their investments get whacked, then they will stop investing in venture funding.  There's a pretty strong correlation between VC funding and the stock market.  Already the markets are down pretty hard since they topped in June.  If you remember the dotcom boom, it was during a massive bull market in the stock market.  As well, after the crash of 2008, the nadir of the markets being March 2009, there's been almost a doubling of the stock market since then, so by 2011 lots of rich people got very, very rich and are willing to spread out their investments.<p>However, since June, the US markets are down 15%. The German market is down almost 30%, Chinese markets down 23%, Indian markets down 22%, Brazil down 25%.  There are a lot of rich people around the world that don't feel as rich as they used to.  If this trend continues and spills over to 2012, these rich people will definitely pullback on discretionary investments, the top of them being venture funding.  So if you want a gauge on how VCs will behaving, I'm personally going to be looking at the stock market to see how it's going to behave.",1322411041

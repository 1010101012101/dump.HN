It would be interesting to see the statistics at the top of the article from now on, to see if flash will shrink fast, slowly or remain strong. Or even grow, but I would not bet on this last one.",1273748873

I'm just moving myself and a team from past-experience of SVN into the world of git.<p>None of us know git, but we're all vaguely aware of it. Unfortunately the place we are at requires us to integrate with ClearCase and SVN, and to make matters worse we're all on Macs and Linux for which ClearCase tools don't appear to exist.<p>Our proposed solution to bring sanity to this is to use git with git-cc and git-svn to act as bridges to the legacy systems, whilst putting all new work natively into git.<p>Now... I'll be the first to admit that we're not full of confidence about this as it's the fear of the unknown, so if anyone else has solid advice on how to work with git and workflows and integrating into existing legacy systems I would be keen to hear it.",1273748747

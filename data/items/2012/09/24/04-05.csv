On the bigger issue here, though, it does seem if apple is being a bit emotional in the whole thing.  They are the most profitable/successful company in the world right now. $700bn is insane market cap, its 2-3x GE under Jack welch.  They should be 100% focused on kicking ass with product.

It is useful only in the handful of US cities that have decent public transport. In Paris, one of the great public transport cities in the world, google still doesn't provide public transport information. In 2012. Apple's solution, to rely on 3rd party devs for this has every chance if providing a solution to iPhone users before Google.<p>2) But even assuming you're one if the lucky few for whom Google provided public transport information, you can still use Google maps from the browser.

E.g., prototyping, exploring, pushing out a MVP for user testing, adding a quick-and-dirty version of a feature to get real-world feedback.<p>In the latter mode, I'm very tolerant of errors just as long as I can diagnose the problem quickly. The way I start is to catch exceptions at a very high level, tell the user something nice, and have myself paged. If something blows up, I fix it quickly. There's no sense in making code robust if I don't know if it will exist next week.<p>Basically, the two approaches are the same only if you have infinite time and money.

What is the role of the state in employment?<p>A libertarian view would have the state remove any barriers (short of money) that would prevent an individual from improving their own skills.<p>A traditional capitalist view would have the state provide enough educational opportunity to become 'minimally skilled' and achieve a living wage.<p>A socialist view would add to the capitalist view with a support network for folks with additional disadvantages such as learning disabilities or other impairments.<p>A communist view would provide jobs regardless of skill even if the product produced nothing of economic value.<p>A despotic or corrupt view would empower people to enslave others to increase their economic output as long as it didn't make the state 'look bad' to the international press.<p>Its a spectrum (more like a 3D surface) with folks all over the map.

Actual government spending on technology is a fraction of the ~10% of govt spending that is non-wealth-transfer and non military.  The actual amount of $$ even to <i>run the government</i> (ie, laws and such) is shockingly small and in the big picture reasonably efficient). Honestly, NASA is not the problem.  That's like people who think it makes sense to take away coffee at work to save money. Businesses don't fail because of runaway coffee consumption by employees.  They fail on the big picture stuff.

[Clinton also signed off on the consolidation of the oil companies in the 1990s (chevron, etc), empowering more of your bogeymen.]<p><i>[You think all the oil companies are just twiddling its thumbs, assuming at some point we'll stop wanting to run on our cars by burning prehistoric goo and they'll just shut down the business and go golfing?] [Do you think Mitt Romney is against Obama's new car MPG efficiency standards because of ""onerous regulations,"" or that it will lead to less profits for his Republican friends at Haliburton?]</i><p>This is also just off point.

It makes for interesting reading and it is more in the spirit of what HN is usually talking about:<p><i>Like many of the bedrock technologies that have come to define the digital age, the Internet was created by  and continues to be shaped by  decentralized groups of scientists and programmers and hobbyists (and more than a few entrepreneurs) freely sharing the fruits of their intellectual labor with the entire world.

Also, aren't those 4 suggestions redundant? Shouldn't it just have a single ""search the web"" suggestion, which pops up the standard browser selection dialog and allow the user to choose the default?",1348459370

Also just came across this question on stackexchange  <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/165380/how-to-really-master-a-programming-language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/165380/how-to...</a><p>Quoting part of the top answer here:<p>""""""\nHere is a partial list:<p>Use the language all day, every day. Usually this means being full-time employed in the language.<p>Read all you can about the language. Especially, ""best practices"" and idioms.<p>Join a users group to talk with others about the language and what they do with it.<p>Work with other people's code! There is no faster way to learn what not to do in a language than to have to clean up after someone did something awful.<p>Support the code you write - every bug becomes a tour of your worst decisions!<p>Study computer science and languages in general<p>Learn a very different language. A great compliment to C would be a functional language like Lisp. This will turn the way you think about your procedural language inside out.<p>Learn to use the frameworks and APIs available for that language.<p>Take the time to do your own experiments with the language. SICP is not applicable to C, but the attitude of learning a language by testing its limits is a very productive one.<p>Read the history of the language to learn why it was made the way it is.<p>Attend conferences to hear the language authors speak, or to hear what industry leaders are doing with the language.<p>Take a class in the language.\n""""""",1348459335

4563150,comment,4562912,4563113,5,0,andreyf,,,"I think ""why did they ship the new maps app before it was ready?"" is the most interesting question about this whole debacle.<p>I don't think they actually gather user-generated map content via iOS maps, so (1) doesn't make much sense to me.<p>(2) strikes me as weird reasoning. If there's a good argument that Apple needs their own maps, enough to justify the acquisitions, it doesn't seem likely that the project would get dropped.<p>I don't think (3) makes sense: they cut out critical functionality like public transit in directions. I don't see a reason to ship something which reduces useful features unless there was a very compelling reason.<p>I think the most likely reason was actually pressure of some kind from Google's side.",1348459286
4563149,comment,4562810,4562940,9,0,kens,,,"The new USB 3.0 power delivery spec supports 3A at 20V over micro-USB for potentially 60 Watts delivered via micro-USB and 100W over USB. The idea is to get rid of laptop charger plugs entirely and replace them with USB. A bunch of companies are on this standard, including Dell, Foxconn, HP, Intel, Microsoft, and Nokia. Apple is absent for some reason. This standard will also allow external hard drives, printers, etc to be powered over USB without a separate power plug.<p>This will be an interesting change if the standard catches on.

4563145,comment,4562912,4563082,15,0,fpgeek,,,"It is worth noting that Google themselves didn't offer turn-by-turn directions until Android 2.0 (October 2009). Interestingly, Google Maps Navigation launched in the US shortly after they had ditched Tele Atlas (owned by TomTom) as a US data provider. It was speculated (though not confirmed, as far as I could find) that Google ended the relationship because it was too expensive/restrictive with respect to turn-by-turn navigation.<p>That makes me wonder if original turn-by-turn restrictions were Google's idea or a requirement of Google's existing contracts. If so, it's obvious Google decided to continue those restrictions for their own reasons and so history has repeated itself.",1348459214

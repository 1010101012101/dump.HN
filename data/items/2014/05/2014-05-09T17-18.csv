7722286,comment,7716430,7717940,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> If the city let you build in just those areas, it&#x27;d be a huge boon to competition against Comcast, because it hits them among the subset of customers that actually justify their business in the city. This is true even though only a relatively small number of customers may have an alternative to Comcast. You don&#x27;t get perfect competition this way, but it weeds out a lot of the obviously bad behavior.<p>In your scenario the newcomer could easily drive Comcast out by aggressively competing on price. Since they don&#x27;t have to subsidize other parts of the city they could profitably charge lower prices than Comcast, and internet service is a fungible product with price sensitive customers, so Comcast would no longer be able to make enough in the affluent areas to carry on subsidizing the rest of the city. Comcast would be forced to walk away from the whole city and leave the newcomer as the new monopolist.<p>The alternative is that the newcomer doesn&#x27;t compete aggressively. This is the status quo in areas where there is an incumbent cable company and an incumbent telco both offering similar service. They both know that they can each torpedo the margins of one another through aggressive competition, so neither makes any concessions to customers lest the other respond in kind and make the gesture a pure cost yielding no competitive advantage. Similarly, if one of them does something customer-hostile, the other takes it as an invitation to follow suit, because maintaining balance is more profitable than taking the other&#x27;s customers thereby inviting them to take yours.<p>The whole problem is that last mile is a natural monopoly. Aggressive competition in that situation is ruinous -- it just drives all but one of the providers out of business because the point at which it ceases to be advantageous for a non-colluding provider to gain customers by undercutting the other&#x27;s prices is well past the point where each provider can recover its roll out costs. One way or another you end up with either a monopoly or a cartel that behaves as a monopoly.",1399658116

It feels good to be the hero, but you need to stop and work on fire prevention to get to a point where fires almost never happen. If you just play hero and ignore the root problems, you&#x27;ll end up with a squad of great firefighters that you don&#x27;t need, and a product that&#x27;s still on fire regularly.<p>Unfortunately, it often looks (to others) like the firefighters making these great sacrifices are the best, most dedicated employees (and they may be), but all too often the person who leaves at 5 every day is the one keeping the fires under control in the first place.

There&#x27;s no reason to not use an enum here -- requiring a cast is not a bad thing.<p>There are very few cases where you should have implicit conversions. Implicit conversions basically imply that the two types are so similar that no possible semantic difference can be observed after the conversion. For example, int is implicitly convertible to long because there can be no possible information loss and almost every case where long is allowed, an int would also be allowed in that place. Even overload resolution works correctly because the overload is first tried without the implicit conversion.<p>Enums (or other structs), on the other hand, can easily have different semantics. For example, if the enum values are auto-assigned and you add a value into the middle of the enum, all subsequent values are now offset-increased by 1. If you then switch on the int values, but not the enum values, your semantics will change.<p>Here an explicit cast is a good thing -- it&#x27;s saying to the compiler that I&#x27;m doing something potentially dangerous, but just trust me on this one.",1399656916

Build a song around a chunky &#x27;AC/DC-style&#x27; riff. Channel Quincy Jones in the drum sound. Sampling was very important in the democratization of music production because it allowed artists without access to a studio and a host of instruments to work from a baseline of recorded sound. It quickly developed into an artform unto itself.<p>Yes, there was and still is a contingent of artists who sample lazily and with disregard for the original music, but Dr. Dre&#x27;s productions--especially his early stuff--are full of musical reverence, high-quality engineering, and even improvements over the source material. Not to mention that after the NWA days he was increasingly bringing in session musicians to replay and reinterpret source material rather than actually sampling it digitally.<p>edit - And to expand a bit more on the last sentence, that is exactly what music producers do. It&#x27;s only in recent years that the end-to-end musician, producer, recording engineer, mixing engineer, and mastering engineer has come into fruition. And that democratization of the recording process largely stems from technological advances like digital sampling.",1399656758

Noise-cancelling in an office, you barely need to pay anything, because &quot;noise-cancellation&quot; is achieved by the headphones picking up background noise with a small microphone and then playing a dampening noise in reaction to a sound wave. This is easy when the background noise is constant - that&#x27;s why &quot;white noise&quot; in offices works so well. But if the noise is varied, it&#x27;s impossible to predict how loud or soft the next sound wave is going to be, and headphones are always slightly behind in reaction, as it is.

Ironically this forces the engineer to limit the amount of bass in the mix, so there some truth to the claim that a headphone with exaggerated bass will produce a sound closer to the intention of the artist.&quot;<p>Not true. Engineers working in pop and hip hop mix primarily with the understanding that the first listen by a consumer will be on the radio in their car. This has several built-in assumptions, and the expectation of lots of sub bass being reproduce-able is not among them. Sales of records are heavily affected by how good the song sounds on the radio, and most people have the audio equipment that came with their car.<p>Not only that, the <i>next</i> stage of music marketing evolution is earbuds. So, if one were to mix for the next most popular method of getting your music into the ears of consumers, you&#x27;d mix with the expectation of being heard first through cheap earbuds.<p>Engineers mix knowing that their tracks will be played on a wide variety of equipment, from very bad to very good. The more accurate their equipment is, the better they&#x27;ll be able to serve all of those listeners. But, the best results will always come from having accurate equipment for playing it back.<p>I&#x27;m also an audio engineer, and I, too, find the $300 beats headphones to be an abomination to both good sense and good taste. But, I disagree with your suggestion that engineers are mixing with less bass because subwoofers exist.",1399655381

I am a fan of period instruments and technical performances, rather than the more mainstream recordings by someone like Yo Yo Ma.<p>So some great performances that I personally love:<p>Anner Bylsma, Cello Suites on a Baroque cello\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Suites-Cello-BWV-1007-1012/dp/B0000027TV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Suites-Cello-BWV-1007-1012/dp/B00...</a><p>Jordi Savall and Hesperion, The Art of Fugue\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Die-Kunst-Fugue-Art/dp/B00005NTKF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Die-Kunst-Fugue-Art/dp/B00005NTKF</a>\n(I love all their recordings and Savall does a mean Sainte-Colombe)<p>For Bach&#x27;s Musical Offering I have a hard time saying which is the best: I have too many favourites.\nMaybe just hit up Youtube until you find one that grabs you,  but try and avoid anything that isn&#x27;t in HD quality.\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Musical+Offering"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Musical+Offerin...</a>\nSavall does a fine version here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4lwV3IMHMQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4lwV3IMHMQ</a>",1399655063

And, as I said: Most cheap products accidentally fail at this goal.<p>It costs a bit of money to produce a quality transducer that is stable, reliably mass-produced, and lasts a long time. Not as much for headphones as for larger transducers, however. For $100 you can buy any of several models that are <i>extremely</i> accurate (compared to what $100 would buy you in speakers). Sennheiser, Shure, AKG, and Audio Technica all offer several models in the $50-$100 range that will destroy Beats offerings at even much higher price points.<p>Nonetheless, just because most people&#x27;s cheap headphones suck doesn&#x27;t mean that a company producing expensive headphones that suck should be given a pass. In a world with good products in a field I care about, why wouldn&#x27;t I encourage people to choose them over a clearly inferior product? Beats is a demonstrably inferior product with good marketing.",1399654820

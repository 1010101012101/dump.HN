I had a little blog in 2004; towards the middle of 2005, we felt like we had crappy marketing, sales, and outreach. We wrote a marketing plan with 3 major prongs --- Google ads, having everyone start writing for the blog, and I forget the third thing. The only thing that worked was the blog.",1221353252

You have to tackle ATT and Verizon differently.<p>My point is not that Apple is more open than others. That still does not make it standard.<p>Yes you can build apps that polls a server etc..., but again when building apps, there is no standard. Iphone apps do not work on Symbian phones. What kind of open is that?<p>BB is not truly open either. Maybe this has changed by now, but we could not get to collect SMS. How open is that?<p>The point I am trying to make is that developers should not be suprised where there apps are shut down by the SMS gateway provider, or the carrier, or Apple, or BB, or ......<p>Developers should focus on applications that they can write once and  can deploy everywhere.",1221350678
303484,comment,303199,303470,0,0,benjamincanfly,,,"The difference is that it's unpredictable, based on Apple's whims. If they said ""Hey, here is a list of apps we won't accept from third party developers because we consider them to be competitive,"" that would be one thing. But as it stands, we don't even know where the line in the sand is, because the line is based on Apple's best interests, not those of the developers. Dozens of developers have released apps that duplicate (and improve upon) the functionality of the built-in Notes app, but when someone writes an app for podcast streaming (which the iPhone does <i>not</i> already offer, but which I'm sure they're planning on adding eventually), Apple nixes it. It's not just difficult, it's demoralizing.",1221350637

(They're not examples because I don't think they're pulling sufficient revenues yet. Correct me if I'm wrong)<p>From what I've gathered, there are more examples at the other end of the spectrum closer to the 'free sample' - free users get a good, usable trial, but premium users are what it's about. I'd call that more of a sales method then a business model.<p>Anyway, from that I'd say that <i>a hybrid trial/freemiumÂ²</i> is a reasonable idea. I would put more chips on the product if it's for businesses.",1221350432

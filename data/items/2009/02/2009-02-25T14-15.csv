And it would be great if you can let the users choose to display their karma in specific dates!<p>There is something more advanced also... Can you analyze the topics that user is writing about that helped him in increasing his karma?
Also recommend a stories for the user to comment on... that's related to the user's interested topics based on his/her previous comments.<p>I think this is hard somehow... because it needs so much of analyzing, data mining... and some logical factors to work with!<p>What do you think? :D",1235573917

Now we work in concrete jungles, grey cubes, beige walls and highways.<p>People forget that for thousands of years we were hard wired to kill those attacking us, hunt for food, and protect our family.

These are the Pure Functional languages.<p>I am leaning towards 1 more than 2 personally, but many people would disagree with me on that one. The question is: Do you want a usable program written in class 1 or 2?

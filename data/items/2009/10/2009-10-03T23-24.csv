Amazon's figuring it out.<p>If you can recreate the volume from a snapshot and hit it with fresh instances and run into the same problem, this is quite worrying. If it had resolved after a restore from backup, I would have felt better about EBS. As I see it there are only these options :<p>1) There is a general, systemic failure in EBS. You ran into it and highlighted it to AWS and they are fixing some problem. If other people are not having the same problem as you, I would be more inclined to think of #2.<p>2) Some usage pattern violates an assumption that was made when EBS was designed and screws it. Restoring from the backup reproduces the usage pattern. This could be simultaneous connections or # of distinct files in the volume, for example. One way to test this would be to split the data in the drive into a larger number of smaller EBS-es (EBSii? whatever the plural(: ) or throttle the simultaneous connections and see what happens.<p>did I miss anything?",1254614112

I think the fundamental issue (aside from the amazon issue) is you had bytes living on a single EBS disk that weren't replicated to another disk. For important data, this is probably a bad idea regardless of backup strategy, etc.<p>Edit: By the way, the point here isn't to say ""you guys screwed up"" but to underscore that these types of issues aren't 100% Amazon's fault either, both parties had issues and the tone of your post seems to be ""EC2 and EBS are not reliable we are switching off of it"" when the truth lies somewhere in the middle.",1254611198

Their owners might disagree though.<p>And there are plenty of 'real' businesses out there that make a loss.<p>It's really not that simple to put out a definition of what really is a business, but I think that something that lives by the grace of an API as a total dependent on some other company does not count as a business in its own right.<p>Every now and then you come across a rant somewhere from someone that got 'cut off by google' because they depend for 100% of their sales on search engine traffic, and google happened to provide the bigger portion of that.<p>Suddenly they find out that even though they were profitable last month they did not have an actual business, they forgot to realize they were actually a small extension of the google ecosystem and were only able to make a profit because of that. Anybody that has been in business for a while would realize that is an accident waiting to happen.<p>Making your company 100% dependent on FB or Twitter is no different.<p>It's easy money if and when it works, but easy come, easy go.",1254611192

(see <a href=""http://computersandcomposition.osu.edu/archives/v2/2_4_html/2_4_08_Waddell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://computersandcomposition.osu.edu/archives/v2/2_4_html/...</a>).<p>This concept was adopted by hundreds of software authors in the 80’s, and quickly evolved to include time limits and activation keys long before Uniloc. Users enjoyed the ability to try a fully functional product before purchase. However, even Wallace acknowledged he got the term shareware, which embodies the whole try before you buy idea, from a computer column that appeared in Infoworld magazine in the 70’s.<p>Secondly, software protection schemes that relied on hardware to generate security keys were common-place in the mid 80’s. Australian software company Pittwater Distributors developed an application called Cashbook in the early 80’s which used a plug-in hardware dongle (a small hardware key) in order to secure the application. Other companies such as Alpha-Micro and Sun-MicroSystems used serial numbers stored in the physical hardware of the computer.<p>I personally worked on a software encryption and protection systems in 1984 for game publisher Electronic Arts which relied on keys derived from the physical software media (a tape or disk). This approach was extremely common-place at the time.<p>In short, software trial mechanisms and protection systems were obvious, common-place technologies and marketing models long before Uniloc.<p>I agree with the judge.",1254611178

Whereas in e.g. Scala, &quot;5 + 6&quot; is just calling the &quot;+&quot; method on 5 (I can see it right there, on Int: &quot;def +(x: Int): Int&quot;).<p>I also find OO polymorphism a bit more discoverable than typeclass-based polymorphism. You can look at an OO object in the REPL and see what methods it has on it, in a way that&#x27;s harder to do in Haskell.<p>You pay the price eventually of course - in Scala you end up needing more machinery to be able to treat &quot;+&quot; as a two-argument function, and you need typeclasses for certain problems so you end up having two different forms of polymorphism. But the tradeoff is that you can learn the less general version first and get started quicker, even if you end up having to learn more overall.",1428569910

Wiki has the term defined for dual phase:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing</a><p>> Gradual typing is a type system in which variables may be typed either at compile-time (which is static typing) or at run-time (which is dynamic typing), allowing software developers to choose either type paradigm as appropriate, from within a single language.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is just poor writing (as Siek defines it, it should be from dynamic to static), but there is enough confusion here where you might bother using the term for adding stronger dynamic type checks to an otherwise less dynamically typed language (if you admit dynamic types as types, of course). Also, a dynamically checked type signature is the first step to a statically typed one (as long as your types remain weak enough that static typing is achievable in the future). So in that sense, it is &quot;gradual&quot; typing, just from a meta perspective :)",1428569503

The subviews need to inform the main view when the user changes an appointment time so that the main view can re-layout all the subviews.\nIn this case there is no need for the main view to listen for events from subviews. The code will be much simpler and easier to debug if the subview just makes a call to the main view directly (the subview should be constructed with a pointer to the main view). When I look at code in the subview I don&#x27;t have to guess who may be listening to the event, I can see the call directly. It also means that other views apart from the main view cannot randomly listen sub-view events as a &#x27;quick fix&#x27; for some bug.<p>The point is that javascript tends to lead one down an event driven route. But you should only use events if you want to decouple things. Cohesion is also very important in design because it makes things simpler and more encapsulated. You need to decide what the boundaries of your component are. In this case I want the calendar to be the component, not it&#x27;s subviews. So within the calendar I will make direct function calls, there are less events in the system and it is easier to think about and debug.",1428568537

9346341,comment,9345026,9345026,0,0,davidgerard,,,"PIT OF DESPAIR, Birmingham, Tuesday (UNN) — A South Somerset Atrocity Terrier named Soberhill Black Medik Markenbrow Beatrice Vraibleu has beaten 25,000 canine rivals to win Best of Show at this year&#x27;s Crufts in Birmingham.<p>The event, held in the Gladiator Pit at Birmingham&#x27;s National Exhibition Centre, attracted more than 143,000 freak-show ghouls and failed concentration camp doctors.<p>Soberhill Black Medik Markenbrow Beatrice Vraibleu is owned by top breeder Diana Mosley-Mengele, 48, of Gloucestershire. &quot;It is unbelievable. This dog has done so well. It is the greatest accolade you could wish for. We may have to think about retiring him now because there is nothing left for him to do. Of course, we can&#x27;t breed from him, because the genitalia have been entirely bred out of the line in order to allow the extra legs to grow in.&quot;<p>Second place went to a one-year-old pit bull terrier called Thatcher, who, in a virtuoso display of the breed&#x27;s skills, ate one of the judges.<p>Dog breeding in the UK is concerned with every detail of a dog&#x27;s appearance. &quot;The perpetual haemophiliac bleeding from the snout must trickle along approved lines,&quot; said Miss Mosley-Mengele. &quot;In addition, the lifelong whimperings of pain must be pitched between 3000 and 5000 Hertz. I had to drown four bags of culls on this point in the last month alone.&quot;<p>Other events in the Arena yesterday included the Flyball Team semi finals and finals, the Agility International Invitational and a parade of Obedience winners. Particularly good showing in the Obedience trials came from those dogs who helped in corraling their fellow canines and assisted their owners in the vital genetic and surgical work needed to further the show-dog hobby.<p>Victoria Stilwell, star of the TV show Cull The Unterhünd, set a few hearts aflutter around the show whilst filming a special episode of the popular programme and personally chopping up bloody hunks of cull to throw to the aspiring Crufts entrants.<p>Crufts was established in Argentina in 1946 by public-spirited recent German immigrants who felt their skills and hobbies were no longer welcome in their homeland. This year&#x27;s event has been overshadowed by accusations that the show is cruel, with animal charities and the International Criminal Court in the Hague expressing their concerns. Show organiser the Kennel Club is putting measures in place to deal with the problem, starting with kidnapping PETA activists and mincing them for dog food.<p>PICTURE: Soberhill Black Medik Markenbrow Beatrice Vraibleu, the South Somerset Atrocity Terrier who won this year&#x27;s Crufts.

It&#x27;s that NO model is right.<p>See chaos theory or google &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;. There certainly is a model that is right - an obvious model would be just take all actors, their holdings, and their actions, that trivial model certainly is right. There are even people who have this model available to them : the stock exchanges. In theory, no-one else has it available, and we should be sure they&#x27;re not using or selling this model, right (heh) ?<p>Black swans are quantifiable. For instance, calculating the current debt loads of governments will tell you that interest rates aren&#x27;t going back up without killing social security or something like a 300% (cumulative) inflation. Since we won&#x27;t be killing social security, a sudden crash (at least 40% drop in SPY) followed by a short-term (~1-2 years) tripling of prices is coming. Alternatively, there could be lots of sovereign defaults, resulting in 10-20% treasury interest rates for 5-10 years. There. Quantified.<p>Black swans happen because we, as in humanity, have this need to believe that things won&#x27;t change. When they inevitably do change, the first thing we do is to use capital to get us back to the old situation. But that hardly ever works. When it fails, it requires exponential use of &quot;capital&quot; and the capital is gone (so no-one is ever getting their investment back). A recent obvious example I saw of this is Abu Dhabi : the idea that you can have a lush, green, modern city in the middle of the desert. This is wrong, it&#x27;s artificial. And every millimetre the city grows comes at exponentially increased energy expenditure, exponentially increased stress on all the systems that support this city, and on a regular (as in weekly) basis a sandstorm comes and makes it blatantly obvious what happens if those systems would fail for even single week. But trillions of dollars are being invested to change this, because it was almost reasonable to do this for a small oasis with a freshwater source. As expected, this city is burning an ever-rising share of the oil income of the state just to keep existing. Black swan coming up, right there.",1428567543

9346272,comment,9342994,9345148,0,0,jib,,,"Here&#x27;s my view, based on 10 odd years in various CS roles.<p>I think there&#x27;s confusion about good/bad customer experience and what that means. Great staff doing great interactions is important, but if you focus just on that you&#x27;re missing out on two important earlier layers.<p>No-one really wants to talk to customer support. Ever. So trying to be good at talking to people is nice, and you better be good at it when you need to or you will lose some customers (whether that be through lack of acquisition from bad stories or people actually quitting), but it&#x27;s like the third level of defense, and it is arguably less important than the first two levels.<p>The first level is &quot;Make sure your stuff just works&quot;. Actively work towards eliminating defects. The best product is the one that just works. People hate on Ryanair in Europe - I think it is vastly exaggerated. They get the point that having things just work is huge. They &quot;just work&quot; better than any other airline. They suck completely at the third level, and are only ok at the second level, but they are good at the first level. And sometimes good at first level, and good prices, is all you need.<p>Second level is - if things for some reason dont work, make it easy for me to fix it myself. Again - I dont want to think about your thing, I just want it to work, but if you&#x27;re making me think about it by having it break, at least make sure I can do all my thinking and solving in one go - best way to do that is to let me fix it on my own. Sky broadband does a decent job of this. Their routers come with built in self-service menus rather than random error screens. Along the lines of &quot;Something is wrong - lets start by plugging and unplugging the wires. Here&#x27;s what a micro-filter is and looks like, check if you have one of those in place. Ok, lets power-cycle the router, you do that by just unplugging this wire...&quot; 100% better than having a generic error screen or referring to online help.<p>Third level is - If you failed at the first two levels, make it easy and nice to talk to you. Important, not least for PR reasons, since people who failed the first two levels and also fail on the third will be really pissed off with you, but arguably less important than the first two layers, if they are done right. The other reason it is hugely important is that your improvement points on level 1 and 2 will come from 3. If your team isnt set up to continuously feed back what they are hearing from 3 and use that to improve 1 and 2, you&#x27;re not going to get better.<p>The fourth bonus level is &quot;f you failed the first three, at least have a decent social media setup to manage your awfulness&quot;.<p>A good CS organisation recognises all three levels at least, and spends time on all of them. You continually work on moving things from the third level up to the first, or at least the second, and doing that proactive work is part of what makes a good CS team.",1428567308

And as with all things that are precious, there comes (or at least should come) caution.<p>There is nothing that I fear more than loosing my photos, my visual biography.<p>That is why I am super conservative when it comes to software that wants to handle my photos.<p>What are the requirements for software that I allow to manage my photos:<p>- Very good chance of still being in the market in 5-10 years. This basically rules out all Google (Picasa), Apple (iPhoto, Aperture, Photos) products.<p>- Possibility to backup my photos on various destinations (not only one commercial cloud)<p>- A library format that is readable from external applications (SQL, metadata files)<p>- Good tools to search, compare and sort my library<p>- At least support two major platforms natively<p>Unfortunately, the only software that meets most of these requirements is Adobe&#x27;s Lightroom. And this is very sad:<p>- It has too many features that I do not need - I am not a professional photographer<p>- It does not care about native UIs and its usability I still find weak<p>- It asks for a premium price for professional photographers (both the one-time fee and the creative cloud version)<p>How about alternatives?<p>- Aperture was a very good alternative, despite being only available for Mac<p>- I was disappointed by all open source alternatives; most of which are not easily available for Mac and Windows (Lightzone, Darkroom, Digikam, Shotwell)<p>- Digikam comes closest, but as it&#x27;s KDE based, installation and native support on Windows and Mac is still weak<p>- Capture One Pro 8 works on Mac and Windows but is even more expensive than Lightroom and hence not worth it<p>- I do not know about any other photo management tool that is stable, multi platform and meets most of the conservative demands",1428567228

It is wrong to hate the police despite that there have been lots of officers who have murdered innocent, defenseless people.<p>I don&#x27;t judge individuals by the behaviors of other people.  Recall what MLK said about &quot;the content of our character&quot;.  For me, I don&#x27;t judge someone by the color of their clothes or whether they have a shiny badge affixed to them.<p>I then point out that I have quite a profoundly serious illness: Bipolar-Type Schizoaffective Disorder, and that it is much like being Manic-Depressive and Schizophrenic at the same time.<p>Being crazy gives me lots of real-world experience with law enforcement.  Consider that I was once hospitalized involuntarily for ten solid days because I told some shrink that I planned to &quot;go camping in the desert&quot;.  See, I was completely unaware that in Reno, when one intends to &quot;go camping in the desert&quot;, one intends to commit suicide.<p>It didn&#x27;t help to point out that I had the Boy Scout Wilderness Survival Merit Badge, nor that I had camped in the desert just the night before.<p>I was once beaten unconscious by two cops by having my skull slammed repeatedly into concrete.  When I regained consciousness three days later, while I could correctly visualize the spelling of my own name when I thought about it, I was incapable of spelling it when I attempted to write it on paper with a pencil.<p>You&#x27;d think that would make me hate all police officers but no, I don&#x27;t even hate the two cops who assaulted me with a deadly weapon.<p>However, I do feel that they should be spending some time behind bars.<p>On the other hand there have been plenty of times that police officers have saved my very life.  The ONLY time I ever saw a cop so much as set foot on the Caltech campus was when a Pasadena Police Department officer came to save me from the Caltech campus security guards who beat the living crap out of me then hurled me bodily down a flight of stairs.<p>Finally I write down the URL for &quot;Living with Schizoaffective Disorder&quot; then point out that &quot;I wrote it in part to help people like you help people like me&quot;.<p><a href=""http://www.warplife.com/mdc/books/schizoaffective-disorder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.warplife.com/mdc/books/schizoaffective-disorder/</a><p>Finally, I offer to shake their hand.

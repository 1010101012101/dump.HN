The Zidisha stats page performance is steadily declining toward that end.\nIn the hypothetical case you describe, making 10 loans of $1000 each, you would expect to make $500 in interest but lose about $3,000 in principle to default over a 12-month period.

With the LedgerSMB codebase, we have a mixture of code before the fork, which is a mixture of Perl spitting out HTML as strings in pieces and Perl assembling db queries in little pieces, so your comment made me somewhat uncomfortable because it reminded me of what I am going through in the rewrite process.<p>> - last wc -l check, was well into 1m lines in house code<p>wc -l was in my case closer to 200k, but once you exclude blanks readmes, documentation and comments we added, it got down to about 100-130k.  Not really sure.<p>However, the code was messed up in ways that are only possible by taking powerful features of a language and systematically abusing them.  In the db, needless polymorphic associations which served no purpose.<p>Almost every module had a name of exactly 2 letters, and the scope of some of the modules was just breathtaking. PE.pm for example handled logical groupings of parts for point of sale, customer discount groups, and project accounting.<p>Now if there were modules that did too much, there were also modules which were divided for no reason at all.  You had, for example, ar/ap workflow and user interface split between aa.pl, arap.pl, and arapprn.pl (the latter being printing support functions).<p>This is code that every time I work with it, I find unpleasant surprises lurking beneath the surface.  It is code that when we forked failed basic tests for things like rounding numbers (financial app).  We fixed that right away.<p>If we are lucky we will be done with the rewrite in another five years.<p>> Some of the people in this thread should get together and start a new dailywtf clone. Pretty sure we could preload a years worth of content with nothing but grep and git-log.<p>Definitely.  I am up for it.  Should I start a blog and post the url here?

7340090,comment,7338221,7338763,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"Well, I&#x27;ve worked on both.<p>Wall Street people are ruthless and greedy. If the trade they want to do means getting up at 3:00 am (or, even, getting the team up) for the European open, they&#x27;ll do it. They want to win, and they play hardball. However, Wall Street&#x27;s rules are well-defined (unlike in VC) and most of the obviously unethical things have been made illegal. Wall Street people, for the most part, don&#x27;t like being in jail and would rather avoid that. <i>Most</i> people on Wall Street are (although ruthless) actually ethical. There are exceptions but they tend to take a lot of collaboration (see: housing bubble) and it&#x27;s actually hard to get people like that to &quot;conspire&quot; on anything. It just has to happen, emergently, and it only happens once every 10 years or so.<p>See, predictable, greedy, and mostly ethical people (with a few unethical ones in the mix, as anywhere) aren&#x27;t that dangerous a set. If someone costs you your job, you get another one. No big deal. It&#x27;s true that you have about a 20% per year chance of getting laid off on the street, but it&#x27;s not stigmatized and your co-workers (and often your managers) will go to bat to help you get a better next job. (Silicon Valley probably has the same 20%/year job-loss rate, but startups refuse to have an honest lay off and mask those firings as &quot;performance&quot;-related or &quot;cultured fit&quot;, meaning there&#x27;s no severance and the startup&#x27;s reputation is preserved at the expense of the ex-employee.)<p>In the Valley, people may not be as open about liking money, but they are more hung up on power and, at high levels, it&#x27;s like high school. That&#x27;s why social proof is so important in raising the first round of funding: because it&#x27;s essentially adolescence all over again. The stakes are lower (Silicon Valley can&#x27;t tank the economy in the way that Wall Street can) but the petty personal grudges are more common and people are much more willing to go out of their way just to hurt someone they dislike.<p>It used to be, in the Valley, that people went out of their way to help each other. If a startup CEO had to lay people off, he introduced the laid-off people to investors so they could start their own companies (presuming they didn&#x27;t compete directly with him). Now, that same reputation economy exists but, instead of it being powered by people helping each other out, it&#x27;s powered by people pushing each other down to solidify their own positions.",1393940816

Probably the smartest people you meet in your life will be colleagues. It&#x27;s a very stimulating environment.<p>* You get to work with young and enthusiastic students and researchers, who constantly challenge you and bring new ideas to the table. It keeps you young.<p>* You see ideas and technologies that most people don&#x27;t.

You can think on much greater timescales, and propose and investigate ideas with no direct application.<p>* When you make a real contribution, find a great result, or inspire other researchers, it&#x27;s hugely rewarding.<p>* You&#x27;re part of a machine that has generated enormous progress. Often people don&#x27;t recognise it, particularly in Computer Science, because commercial companies appear to have &quot;invented&quot; things that they actually developed from work in academia. The most incredible discoveries and theories have come from academia.<p>* Every day can be different. You don&#x27;t repeat the same research twice, so it&#x27;s a constant progression. This can be really exciting and stimulating.<p>* You get to travel the world to collaborate, to attend conferences etc. Sometimes you can extend these trips to holidays; I&#x27;ve travelled more since I became an academic than anyone I know outside of academia. You have the opportunity to move overseas and work at foreign institutions.<p>* You have flexibility in terms of what you wear, how you work, where you work, who you work with -- you get to choose much of the time.<p>* You have an enormous amount of freedom to organise your time as you see fit. Your hours and holidays are incredibly flexible.<p>* The money, whilst not great, is enough to live on.

I disagree with DHH on many things (ActiveRecord’s persistence model being based on MySQL misfeatures has been one of my biggest frustrations with Rails since he introduced it at a RubyConf where we both presented), but he&#x27;s right that this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t belong in Rails.<p><i>Everyone</i>[1] needs a persistence layer and domain objects. That ActiveRecord is <i>both</i> ActiveModel and persistence is neither here nor there—and Rails 3 did a lot to making it possible to separate ActiveModel (domain object behaviour) and ActiveRecord (persistence layer behaviour) in a logical perspective so you can choose to persist differently than ActiveRecord does. Everyone needs some kind of controller. Everyone needs some kind of presentation layer. Aside from providing sane defaults for all of this, Rails doesn&#x27;t try to dictate how your application is built.<p>The “more complex” architecture required for your application is unlikely to be a good fit for <i>my</i> application’s “more complex” architecture. For Rails to anoint one particular “more complex” architecture…is to fail anyone else who doesn’t need that architecture or would need something different. If you want to promote a particular type of architecture, there are ways: write an Engine; include generators. Give people guidance. Tell people <i>why</i> they want to use your particular architecture, but also tell them <i>why</i> they <i>shouldn’t</i> use it. If a lot of people need it, they will adopt it. Like Rspec. Like cucumber. Like ActiveModel::Serializers.<p>And, honestly, consider whether you really need your “more complex“ architecture or whether you can combat it the same way that Basecamp does. We&#x27;re doing that with our product team, trying to find features we can remove and reimplement later when we really need them. Ours is a fairly mature product, so it&#x27;s hard—but it&#x27;s happening.<p>[1] For some large subset of everyone.

Upper management wanted to get rid of early hires with &quot;too much&quot; equity and wanted to pull my technical credibility to justify their firing, but the documents I was asked to sign constituted perjury (blaming people for nonexistent technical shortfalls, claiming that I directly managed people I didn&#x27;t even know, etc.) Some of the claims would have required revising my past and saying I&#x27;d consulted (a consulting VP/Eng, I can&#x27;t make this shit up) with the company before the start date (in order to make the rest of the story check out). They fired me for refusing to do it. When I pointed out that I had grounds for a lawsuit, the CEO threatened to pull family connections and bribe judges.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but I don&#x27;t do &quot;We&#x27;re giving you 10 reports, and your job is to fuck over all of them over the next two months.&quot; I may or may not be a leader (that&#x27;s not for me to decide) but I am surely not a henchman.<p>This is one of the VC darlings and although it was almost a down round (barely above flat) and dilution was heavy, they raised again in late 2013 (almost 2 years after that happened). Granted, this last VC round is essentially a severance, giving the company a couple years to run on fumes while its executives find better things to do with their lives. But I didn&#x27;t get a severance, so why should they?<p>Now, I think companies that are <i>that</i> shitty are pretty rare, even in the VC-funded world. That might be bottom 1% overall and bottom-10% in the VC-funded world.

Companies care a lot about image (being sexy, &quot;cool&quot;, VC darlings, whatever) but not about long-standing reputation-- at least, on the latter, not enough to seriously value doing the right thing.<p>The old Silicon Valley was a pay-it-forward economy. Even when you separated, you were good to other people. If you had to cut people in your startup, you introduced them to investors. People helped each other out. You didn&#x27;t fuck over a talented engineer, because you might want to work with him 5 or 10 years later. That&#x27;s gone now.<p>I do have to offer this disclaimer, though. I never worked on the West Coast. Maybe it&#x27;s different out there, but the things I&#x27;ve heard convince me that it&#x27;s not that different, and I&#x27;ve definitely met dodgy characters in California.<p>Day to day, what angers me is the general lack of respect for engineers in the &quot;new&quot; Silicon Valley.

Yes, having to wait three days for settlement is absurd, but folks are working to speed that up (to just one day, haha).  Yes, the fees add up.  But the systems have been developed over a really long time, and they have multiple levels of protection against you losing all your money.  In the US that&#x27;s the FDIC and SIPC, for regular-sized accounts.  There will never been a direct equivalent for BTC, precisely because no one&#x27;s national security is tied to BTC.

Asking that paints you as a prescriptivist who doesn&#x27;t bother understanding the context the code requires.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing software for a long time, and while I try to write methods as short, clear, composable “paragraphs”, I sometimes will write something much longer than is readable because I can&#x27;t figure out a meaningful way to break it down. That comes over time and reading and interaction with the code.<p>The best developers in my experience are pragmatic. They are aware of design patterns, but don&#x27;t treat them like sewing patterns. They are aware of development practices, but don&#x27;t treat them like holy writ. The GoF design patterns book is an excellent descriptivist treatise, but then people started treating it like a cookbook and looked for reasons to implement Patterns everywhere, rather than extracting the patterns from their code.<p>Blog posts like this one (that tell me that I should use an Interactor) pattern are actively dangerous, because they provide dicta without properly explaining the pain that the pattern evolved to solve, or the proper evolution of the pattern.<p>The current code base I work on shows a lot of evidence of Rails Fads <i>just like this one</i>, and I&#x27;m trying to get my team to step back and ask why we do things certain ways and to go back to first principles.

Don&#x27;t even reach for an ActiveModel::Serializer because it&#x27;s what we&#x27;re preferring now for API representations. Figure out your problem. State it clearly. Write the solution clearly. Find code that works similarly and figure out (a) if and (b) how they can be extracted into common code.<p>There is a cost to adopting things like Presenters and making smaller methods: your interface becomes larger. You can complain all you like of large files and functions, but code bases that have large numbers of classes whose purpose aren&#x27;t clear…are harder to navigate and understand. (I have, in the current code base, unextracted code from external classes when that external class is used in <i>one</i> place and it makes the behaviour more understandable.

I think Bitcoin can be a very good, very useful, universal micropayment platform, and that&#x27;s about it (well, that&#x27;s plenty, really). And you <i>can</i> loan Bitcoin just as you do any other form of money; it just requires trust.<p>The problem with the more vociferous proponents of Bitcoin – and not only Bitcoin; you can see the same thing happen in the tech industry in discussions of women or minorities – is one of politics. The problem is this: many in the American tech industry don&#x27;t know what politics is. According to Wikipedia, it &quot;is the practice and theory of influencing other people on a civic or individual level;&quot; it&#x27;s a general term for managing powers and spheres of influence in society. Worse, they seem to shun it.<p>But politics can&#x27;t be avoided. It is essential to human society. When people shy away from politics, a dangerous thing happens: they practice bad politics based on naturalistic fallacies. I think science oriented folk are particularly prone to that because science concerns itself with what is, while politics concerns itself with what ought to be. Science people might, and do, come to believe that what is, is what ought to be (or the only way to be).<p>In fact, Bitcoin is a very interesting example because it allows (actually, it is only imagined to allow) removing people out of the equation altogether, leaving algorithms. When you take power away from people and put it in the hands of mathematics you indeed lose politics (except, of course, for the original act of seizing that power). But then you lose a lot of what makes us human.<p>I think that there is in Bitcoin a confluence of tech people falling into naturalistic fallacies with a general lack of trust in institutions that has possibly been growing of late among Americans. It is interesting to watch, but the arguments, unfortunately, are no different from the old American-libertarian anti-government, pro-gold, arguments. The difference, this time, is not in political awareness (of which there is a dire lack), but in – here&#x27;s that word again – power. American libertarians traditionally had little power. They have been a small minority of both the general population and even of the rich and influential. But now technology is not only a power (which it always was), but one with exceptionally low barriers to attain. Bitcoin supporters, by virtue of their part in the powerful Silicon Valley sphere of influence, actually do carry a not-insignificant political weight. This will be interesting to watch.<p>Whatever happens, even those who believe in institutions should welcome this challenge, because democratic institutions always benefit, in the long run, from worthwhile challenges. So far they&#x27;ve shown an incredible ability to adapt (though the rate still appears too slow to humans who only live about 80 years), and there&#x27;s no reason to believe they will not evolve for the better as a result of this interesting challenge.<p>It is interesting to watch.",1393938931

So, it is - with practice - clear to see that the singular item comes first, and the item in the foldable container comes second. Perhaps this sort of Type-Driven Development, which is more of a practical mindset than language feature, isn&#x27;t emphasized in the (excellent) books from which the author was learning...but it becomes an invaluable tool in Haskellers&#x27; toolboxes while trawling through package documentation later on.

Getting a hit song on the radio, on iTunes, or Spotify is about opening up opportunities where there is a demand for the commodity - the music - and gives the artist a better bargaining position. Making a living in music is about having other sources <i>as a fundamental rule of the industry</i>. One good contract for a license to a commercial on broadcast television likely would dwarf the income one would receive from an entire year of streaming income. Selling t-shirts will make more than streaming income.<p>I&#x27;ve made more money busking with an acoustic guitar on a busy corner in 2 hours than I&#x27;ve made from streaming. This is how I use Spotify - it&#x27;s a street corner that pays in pennies. However, I can&#x27;t afford to travel the world to get in front of people. Thus, while it&#x27;s very close to the &quot;exposure&quot; concept of compensation, at least there&#x27;s an exchange of monies as a matter of principle.",1445107468

The fact that the power to do that is made available to the programmer, in a safe way, is something very few other languages manage.<p>The point about map, fmap and liftM (as I understand it, I might be wrong) is not entirely correct, in that they apply certain constraints to their usage. This helps to document the code, and also allows us to use precisely what we need, and no more, which leads to safer programming.<p>As for whitespace - no one likes to read or maintain code with inconsistent whitespace, which means whitespace is significant, regardless of whether the compiler cares or not.

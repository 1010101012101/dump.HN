But please don't assume I haven't thoroughly considered the issue.<p>> I've studied economics well, I just haven't come to the same conclusion as you.<p>What are your conclusions? It would be more fruitful to hear your thoughts on the issue rather than a critique of my presentation style.<p>I'm not trying to grind an axe by stating that a subsidy ""shift[s] the burden of cost from the consumers to the taxpayers."" Wikipedia's statement on the impact of subsidies is nearly identical to mine:<p>""Farm subsidies have the direct effect of transferring income from the general tax payers to farm owners.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#Impact_of_subsidies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#Impact_of_...</a><p>I agree with you that the system is complex. The complexity is precisely what makes it difficult to identify the hidden costs of subsidies.<p>A subsidy takes taxpayer money and transfers it to producers of a certain good. I think this is inherently unfair, regardless of whether it's done with good intentions. I think the only fair method is to let people choose for themselves how they want to spend their money without coercion.<p>I'm a vegan, and believe my food choices make a positive impact in terms of the environment and reducing environmental cruelty. But I think it's immoral to force that same belief on others using the apparatus of government. It would be unfair for the government to intervene and make it prohibitively expensive to buy meat or animal products.<p>In addition to being inherently immoral (IMHO), subsidies have unanticipated costs and unforeseen consequences. Some examples:<p>- The artificially low price of the subsidized good leads to an artificially high demand for the subsidized good at the expense of demand for competing goods that are not subsidized. This hurts the producers of those unsubsidized goods.<p>- The corn subsidy has driven the price of corn syrup below that of cane sugar, making corn syrup the sweetener of choice in mass produced foods. Corn syrup is an inferior sweetener and leads to health problems such as obesity.<p>If you require links to supporting commentary I'm happy to provide them.<p>I don't doubt that many subsidies are created with good intentions, but because of the unseen costs and consequences, it is prudent, for the long term health of an economy, to avoid them.",1316568077

3020324,comment,3020133,3020251,2,0,fourk,,,"Thanks for the response! We went with Node.js instead of connecting the client directly to Rabbit primarily because of socket.io.<p>So far the amount of activity has been extremely underwhelming for the node instances, but we'll see if this changes over time. The current total activity amounts to <100 activities per minute, and I'm pretty sure we could support at least an order of magnitude more than that. Each node box has identical state at all times to all of the others, with the exception of currently connected socket.io clients.<p>Honestly the first thing I would do if we had the need to scale horizontally (scaling only for HA for now) would be to reduce the amount of data sent over the wire at all levels. I'd modify the current solution of sending the entire object to send only a reference to the object and what amounts to a diff of old version to new version.<p>I'm pretty new at architecting stuff like this (this project was my first time making architecture decisions), so I'm sure there's plenty of room for optimization. I'm just hoping that it was architected in a way such that if/when it fails due to load, very little of the code will need to be rewritten. However, given current performance, the increase in amount of activity that would be required to overload our architecture seems like one of those 'Good Problems to Have'.",1316567925

Asimov's essay on relativity of wrong should be mandatory reading for people engaging in debates. People forget that even if people make mistakes the world is not black-and-white, not 0 or 1. There's a whole infinity inbetween. People often don't look beyond the fact that no one scores a 1 to see that there are some that are teetering terribly close to 0, a 0.1 maybe, while a few put in a lot of effort to be at a 0.9. This comes up so many times in debates it is not even funny anymore.<p>* When talking about both the left and the right, in American politics, having radical ideas. They completely overlook how radical these ideas are, and the amount of airtime given to them.<p>* When talking about bias in media. Sure Fox, MSNBC, CNN, Comedy Central (if you view the Daily show as a news source) are biased in their own ways, but they're not equal.<p>* When talking about a few false steps in various scientific theories (which is what prompted Asimov to write his essay). Sure there are some unknown and possibly sticky problems with evolution, but that doesn't equate its incorrectness to the incorrectness of creationism (young-earth and otherwise) or intelligent design.<p>* When talking about anti-consumerist behavior. Sure Netflix, Apple, MSFT, and AT&T engage in anti-consumerist (or unpopular) behavior. That doesn't mean that they're all equally wrong, or equally short-sighted.<p>* When talking about the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Are you able to expand on your points a bit more?<p>Are you saying you believe you need some OO elements of polymorphism on car and cdr? Not sure you need these - there are loop constructs that let for ""for each do X"". With macros you could make this do almost any type of iteration.<p>I might be missing your point though, as I'm not sure how Objects help in this scenario.<p>Why can't you iterate on hash tables in Arc? ...or another related question, what do you mean by iterate in the context of a hash table?<p>Similarly... Isn't a dynamic array just a list? Or it is specifically the performance of this that you're concerned about - surely this is just an optimisation step rather than a hole in the language?... Either way, I'll agree that they're convenient for hacking programs together :)",1225011510

What's scary is most of the people I know haven't even heard of this and what it will mean for freedom of information ...""</i><p>I've been aware of this idea kicking around in Parliament for a while (listener of Parliamentary debates) but the technical details have been bouncing around the ISP & sysadmin arena for a while on the Whirlpool forums.

Then a simple piece of paper signed by all people developing the IP assigns ownership to this offshore entity.  For onshore operating, you simply license the IP to your U.S. entity for a small fee.  You can get away with this approach for quite a bit.<p>There is no good answer for how you maintain visas once you quit you day jobs.  This part sucks.  One ""straightforward"" option may be to strike a partnership with an IT outsourcing company that manages employees in the U.S. from India and give them a small piece of the company for handling your employment.   You may find that such a partnership would work well as such an entity is an automatic HR and accounting department for your growing entity.  You focus on creating a great product and your partner focuses on the housekeeping.",1225011161

They said it was a minimum $1,000 US / month to use their system, and I think it was around 2% as a transaction fee beyond that minimum.  A bit pricey for most bootstrapped or self-funded startups I'd say.  I guess they're after the big boys first...",1225011046

344147,comment,343940,343940,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"It's an interesting idea but it would be much more useful if the system didn't just vary individual letters without regard to word boundaries.<p>For example, if I enter ""integration"" the suggestions include ""integoration"", ""integormation"", etc. That's not very useful. I think you need to have some kind of  dictionary to generate better suggestions.<p>I'm not saying that only dictionary words should be used, but variations of letters have very different value depending on where inside a dictionary word they occur.",1225010381

This should be on the onion.<p>""Terrorists known to wear clothes to aid with their terrorism - Clothes are known to keep terrorists warm, helping them to kill innocent civilians. We should think very carefully about banning clothes all together""<p>While we're at it, on a recent flight to the US I was asked ""Where are you staying. You need to provide an address etc"" (Security reasons apparently - I guess terrorists slip up there and reply ""Oh I won't actually be landing... oops!""). I didn't have a clue of the address, I only know how to drive there. The guy checking me in just said ""Ah don't worry, I'll put 'holiday inn, SFO'.<p>Either security like that is important, or it's not. If it's not, get rid of it!",1225008620
344134,comment,343622,344063,0,0,gaius,,,"Whereas with Apple, if you ask ""why should I upgrade from Tiger to Leopard"" the answer is simply, ""Time Machine"". Or with Sun, why should I upgrade from Sol8 to 10, the answer is ""dtrace and zones"". MS really needs a snappy comeback like that.<p>The most complex single document I've ever worked on was my MSc dissertation, 30,000 words, lots of cross-references, figures, footnotes, etc etc. I can't remember if I used Word 97 or 2000, but it was more than sufficient for the task. I could have done it in Word 6 or Word 5.1, even. It truly baffles me why people (even within MS itself) want to keep upgrading it.",1225008591

So if you go to get a business bank account, for example, you can open the account under the name &quot;Firstname Lastname DBA MyCoolInternetCompany&quot;.  You can also get an EIN or TPIN (employer ID number, taxpayer ID number) from the IRS without an official business entity.<p>Later on, once you have customers and revenue, you can then form an LLC for a few hundred bucks depending on which state you are in.  You can do this first, of course, before actually starting your business and getting revenue/customers, and many people do -- but it&#x27;s a common mistake for new entrepreneurs to focus on the fun/exciting stuff like making business cards etc instead of the boring but critical stuff like, you know, actually making money.",1416941891

Harder than most people want to work.<p>I try to convince people to become software engineers all the time, and I tell them all about the salaries and benefits they can expect, and most of the time they just sigh and repeat that it&#x27;s too hard.<p>Also, living in regions of the US where salaries for engineers exceed $100k per year also means incredibly high living expenses, so higher salaries would be necessary to entice people to move from out of the area.<p>As it is, I know people making HALF of what would be entry-level for software engineers, but elsewhere in California, and they have a MUCH better standard of living than entry level engineers.

The senior executive roles within the government and indirect representatives such as European Commissioners are effectively appointed by the PM and their possibly entirely unelected political advisors.<p>The idea that European Commissioners have any meaningful electoral accountability at all is crazy. If you don&#x27;t think so, try this simple test: When our citizens cast their only relevant vote on this matter at the last election in their constituency, was it even possible for them to know the name of the person who would ultimately become the European Commissioner for our country?",1416941033

I don&#x27;t know about the US being /uniquely/ mono-lingual, but depending on exactly where you live, you may have to drive for days or take a relatively long and expensive flight to get to the nearest country with a different language - Mexico. And so you naturally find that relatively few Americans speak other languages, and Spanish is the most common.<p>It might be more accurate to say that Europe is unique in being highly poly-lingual, which I think is mostly due to so many countries with different languages in close proximity, all with easy border crossings and good transportation infrastructure. Many Europeans could probably get somewhere that speaks a different language in hours, by car, train, or plane. I don&#x27;t think that it makes them particularly special, though.",1416941011

For those of us in the Rest of The World getting access to a computer was not as simple as that. We had to wait for things like the VIC-20 to come along, the PET was unseen outside of a magazine cover. There was no sea of surplus computers, particularly ones with floppy disks. Pen and paper was how things got done. You, not knowing that, shows how little you know.<p>True, you could program in almost any language you wanted on almost any platform. However Forth was a novelty and of the few people I knew that had Pascal, none of them actually used it - the box sat there, on the shelf. Much like today you could choose to program in Forth if you really wanted to (or Cobol) but you didn&#x27;t, simple as.

They struggled for weeks on it and most of the class cribbed answers from each other, they were that bad. The difference I had was solid 6502 experience, I took to 68000 like a duck to water, everyone else was still struggling to get their heads around what to me was a simple task.<p>Sure my reminiscences from aeons ago are totally anecdotal but I went on to do lots of stuff in 68000 and, without that first bit of 6502 experience, I would have struggled.",1416940939

Only a few states (mostly midwestern) have no requirement, but even there it&#x27;s basically required for college application.<p>It is true, however, that it very rarely sticks. The reason is twofold:<p>1) It&#x27;s poorly taught: usually only two years is required, and usually in high school (which is too late for really learning a language well) and usually via text books.<p>2) There&#x27;s almost no need and little opportunity for most people in the US to use a foreign language. Even if a non-English language is successfully taught, it&#x27;ll atrophy quickly. Unless you&#x27;re a member of an ethnic sub-community, the only body of non-English speakers less than several thousands of dollars and an ocean away is Spanish--which is why you find most bilingual people in the south and southwest.

There are people who devote their entire lives to pointless things. There are people who work on supposedly pointless things, which later turn out to not be so pointless. There are people who are supposedly working on world-changing things, which really are completely pointless. In the end, you  can&#x27;t predict the future.

If anything, this is just a further argument for reforms like basic income and better treatment of mental conditions (e.g. with better early detection).<p>There are also always comments expressing surprise at how one can suffer from such a mental condition and yet do complex intellectual work like low level programming. These questions are based on the premise that schizophrenia (or a similar condition) impacts your brain in such a way that would make logical reasoning impossible. But that&#x27;s not how it operates - logical reasoning is largely unaffected. Like `daveloyall says in another comment in this thread [0], what&#x27;s affected are a few key &quot;first principles&quot;. For instance, if you&#x27;re persuaded that you&#x27;re being constantly tracked by the CIA, removing all your clothes or dismantling your car to make sure you aren&#x27;t bugged are very logical, reasonable things to do. The problem is that when you&#x27;re operating under premises that are shared with no one else, the resulting dissonance makes integration with the rest of society problematic. But with this in mind, it&#x27;s easy to see why one could be schizophrenic and yet still be able to program or do math or weave baskets, especially if the skills were mastered before the condition developed.<p>Terry is a maker of miniatures [1], and I&#x27;m happy we have such people walking among us.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8658958"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8658958</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/10/in-the-reign-of-harad-iv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/10/in-the-reign-of...</a>",1416940579

It&#x27;s as if they are rational folks for whom first principles or axioms have been shaken up, and indeed are malleable all the time.<p>It doesn&#x27;t sound like Terry would ever think that his dinner plate would sprout legs and walk across the table.  But as he stated in the article, he has thought that some dinners were poisoned.<p>See, the first one can&#x27;t happen.  The second one could technically happen.  Schizophrenics aren&#x27;t <i>stupid</i>, you know? :)  But, their plausibility metrics are <i>broken</i>.<p>Regarding the plausibility of a dinner plate walking across a table: Well, it could happen if the plate is some Transformers(R) style robot, or something.  It could be, if those exist, right?  When a schizophrenic tells you something is true but you think it is implausible, remember: it&#x27;s not implausible to them, because they are rational folks employing a different set of base assumptions than you.  Walking plates are normal in a world that has Transformers(R).<p>Why would a rational person believe in fictional toy robots?  Or even that someone wants to poison them?  ...Well, once you believe in God, or time travel, or aliens, or that the universe is a simulation, or any number of &quot;crazy ideas&quot;... once you <i>actually believe</i> one crazy idea, it&#x27;s all down hill from there.<p>But, it is generally an otherwise sane individual that is running down that hill...<p>Terry specifically mentioned a feeling or belief that God picks random numbers or events as a way to communicate with folks. <i>&quot;I can sit down with my parents and praise God and open the Bible randomly,&quot; he says, &quot;and it will talk.&quot;</i>  All of those sorts of beliefs are rooted in some form of the following base principle: &quot;The world is fundamentally not what the common man thinks it is.&quot;  Once you think that some entity which has the power to alter individual atoms or the results of a coin toss (God, aliens, whatever) <i>exists</i>, then the belief that they would <i>use</i> that power to communicate is just a small logical step away.<p>[EDIT: Indeed, I just found this quote from him: <i>God controls ALL the random numbers in yer life [...]. Every [...] random number from when you awake to sleep [...]</i> So in his world, if you run over a nail in your car and get a flat... Well, you did something to deserve it!]<p>NOTE: Apparently some schizophrenic folks experience vivid, realistic open-eyed hallucinations sometimes (at the peak of a manic episode) or all the time.  I don&#x27;t have much experience with that.  Sometimes those events coincide with seizures and events in which awareness and consciousness is lowered.  I am guessing that my &quot;these are rational folks&quot; argument does not apply at those times (or to some people any the time).",1416940493

During that time, I have worked with many foreign contract workers, and every single one of them was from India or China.<p>A quick anecdote from that experience; two of the foreign workers that I worked with from India grew up in rural villages. Their families could not afford a television of their own, neither could any other family in their village. As a community they owned a single tube television (I can’t remember the size), they would all gather together in a single building (cafe I think) to watch soccer games.<p>While this isn’t mind blowing Somalian starve to death poverty, it is a major contrast to a US upbringing.<p>The vast majority of the foreign workers (that I worked with) were all paid about 1/3 as much as I was. Even if they brought the foreign workers to the US and paid for their living accommodations those workers made less money than I did. That’s why they hire them, because they cost a lot less money.<p>To be clear, I have in the past and I currently do call many foreign contract workers friends.<p>If the reader had read to the end of the article, he would see that I am for foreign workers, if they are guaranteed equal (or Reasonable) pay and equal rights.<p>Cherry picking a wealthy white immigrant that holds an executive position is not representative of the average foreign worker. If you can provide statistics that show the average foreign worker makes similar pay and works similar hours as their white counter parts, I would love to entertain your notion that these people are highly paid and don’t work in poor conditions.<p>What my experience has taught me is that (primarily) large corporations are taking advantage of foreign workers to lower wage and facility costs, which hurts both foreign workers and US workers.<p>You might retort, why would a foreign worker do something that is bad for them?<p>I think it’s their best option, but that doesn’t make it a good one. At this point I would be happy if the government would just enforce basic rights for foreign contract workers, even if they have lower pay. They often work far longer hours than is illegal, but the companies they work for turn their backs at best and at worst force them into it.<p>In closing, I’m not sure what’s xenophobic about wanting foreign workers to be treated with dignity and respect when they work for US companies. But if that’s xenophobic then put me on Fox News, cause I’m all for dignity, respect, and worker’s rights, whether they’re from the US or any other country.<p>In closing, I’m not sure what’s xenophobic about wanting Foreign workers to be treated with dignity and respect when they work for US companies.

I love Git&#x27;s model of commits being objects in their own right, allowing you to cherry-pick them across branches, or rebase them to reorder or squash several commits together, for example.<p>My usual development routine is to make a ton of small commits that add up to a small set of good commits, to promote bisect-ability. I do dozens of rebases, squashes and amends when working on a topic branch.

There have been a few high profile cases of people faking their peer reviews recently. At Sage we dealt with a big case of that earlier in the year and retracted 60 papers. This new case in the posted article seems like it involves 5 published papers and a bunch that got caught before being published. Note that both those cases (and some more) use ScholarOne as the submission management platform.<p>In particular, the new hotness in the academic journal world is open access journals, and OA journals need to be particularly careful about bad stuff slipping through peer review. A few OA journals from Hindawi just lost their impact factor (source: <a href=""http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/10/14/the-scientific-world-journal-will-lose-its-impact-factor-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/10/14/the-scientific-world-journ...</a>), not due to outright peer review fraud, but due to other &quot;abnormal citation patterns&quot;. For OA journals getting or losing an impact factor has a HUGE impact on the # of submissions (which are directly tied to revenue), so there&#x27;s a big need to ensure you don&#x27;t get caught with your pants down when it comes to the peer review process.

[0] is very interpretative, for example:<p>>&quot;[...] suggests that women might also value high grades more than men do and sort themselves into fields where grading curves are more lenient.&quot; //<p>It could equally be that women generally find those other subjects easier, or that the subjects they stay away from don&#x27;t interest them. And, it could be that the grading curves follow the women, rather than the other way around. A corollary of what&#x27;s being said here is that subjects men do are graded more harshly & that fewer men graduate ... and yet the system is said to be prejudiced against women?<p>It&#x27;s interesting that the reasons given are all predicated on differences between the sexes but that the most obvious potential difference [to me] - that women simply don&#x27;t enjoy the STEM subjects so much as men - isn&#x27;t even suggested. Men not giving a damn about grades though, that&#x27;s likely apparently whilst <i>according to the narrative of the article</i> it seems women are delicate little flowers who when they achieve even marginally less than perfection are too devastated to continue.<p>>&quot;Women, admirably, want to excel — and usually do, academically. We earn, on average, higher grades than men in almost every subject.&quot; //<p>Interesting that from this is drawn the conclusion that women are being acted against with prejudice in the college system.<p>>&quot;The majority of new college grads are female, yet women receive only 29 percent of bachelor’s degrees in economics each year.&quot; //<p>If it&#x27;s not down to male vs. female subject preference then it seems most likely that the reason for this are closely related to the reason that men are - in these terms - under-represented in most non-STEM subjects, or in biology, say[3]. What are the feminists that are supposedly sooo concerned about equalising graduation percentages across the sexes in all fields proposing to do about biology [as a subject for study in college]?<p>All I&#x27;ll say on [2] for now, as I don&#x27;t have time to study it, is that in your quote is the line:<p>>&quot;It&#x27;s a pretty well-documented phenomenon that women are perceived as the primary caretaker, and are thus more likely to sacrifice their job to care for children [...]&quot; //<p>But women have a choice to carry a child or not, men don&#x27;t have that choice. This is greater opportunity for women dressed up as male prejudice. If women choose to give birth, breastfeed, then the natural consequence of that are that they are not in the workforce for some period.<p>The NCWIT is very interesting, a good source for statistics. It just lacks comparative statistics. We learn that ~5% of women leave a &quot;SET&quot; job in the &quot;workforce&quot; in order to start their own companies. But we don&#x27;t learn how many men do for some reason, nor indeed how this 5% compares to those who have history majors, say. That makes it very hard to draw conclusions for the data presented.<p>We do get badly used statistics like:<p>>&quot;According to a study by the Center for Work-Life Policy, 74 percent of women in technology report “loving their work,” yet women leave technology careers at a staggering rate.&quot; (Women in IT: The Facts, p.15)<p>In other words 25% of women currently in &quot;technology&quot; don&#x27;t &quot;love&quot; their work [I&#x27;m surprised that&#x27;s so low, not like, not enjoy but <i>love</i>] yet only 41% have quit after 10 years. You see those 2 figures and think, well 41% is really high - but of course the 41% is compounded over time and with the other figures the 74% that say they love their work are predominantly going to be those that haven&#x27;t been doing it very long. Because of the age profile (more old men than old women in tech positions) the comparative figures for men will have people who have been doing the job for far longer. This 74% statistic then is most likely perturbed strongly if there is a honeymoon effect [which I suspect there is in practically all fields of work]. A more careful approach should have been taken to account for these sorts of things and to make a true comparative study - why wouldn&#x27;t you study the population you&#x27;re seeking to emulate and only the one you are seeking to alter?<p>I&#x27;ve droned on too long:<p>>&quot;History professor Cynthia Russett, who studies 20th century women’s history, said administrators should focus on ascertaining whether men and women have equal opportunities to enter different majors, but equalizing participation may be an impossible task.&quot; (Gender gap in majors persists, 2006 [3])<p>[3] <a href=""http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/04/27/gender-gap-in-majors-persists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/04/27/gender-gap-in-major...</a>",1416939363

So your eggs will overcook, the sous-vide ones won&#x27;t.</i><p>This, along with the comments about cooking a steak (where you are simply wrong), seem to assume that when you put a cooler item in a hotter substance, boom, it&#x27;s the temperature of the hotter substance. It turns out that reality doesn&#x27;t quite work this way.<p>An egg, for instance, happens to not only have an insulative shell, it&#x27;s a liquid with a very high level of heat conductivity. When you put an egg in boiling water, the inside heats at a relatively uniform rate, which is exactly how we have concepts like the 6 minute egg. It <i>incidentally</i> turns out that the yolk sets at a higher temperature than the whites, which is how people who want firm whites and a liquidy yolk can achieve their goals, traditionally by timing (boiling water at a given altitude is fairly consistent).<p>The similar concept applies to the steak. A quick sear at high heat (500F+) does almost nothing to cook the inside of the steak -- the heat differential is far too high for it to migrate far through the thick protein layers, but when put in the 200F oven the differential is so low that in that case it <i>does</i> have time to essentially &quot;even out&quot; slowly. You sear first primarily because a room temperature, salted steak sears far better and more quickly than a heated, steaming piece of meat.<p>No, you don&#x27;t wait until the item is 200F. That is absurdity. Personally I use a remote meat thermometer but other people simply go by wisdom and time. Any notion that I have to have the external temperature match what I want the internal temperature to be is...well...it&#x27;s just scientifically ignorant.<p>Exactly as you said, it <i>is</i> all science and chemistry. And you seem to be coming at this as if the steak is a piece of copper. Indeed, I think this whole &quot;cooking better&quot; infatuation of the tech community is an attempt to (much like with NoSQL and a desire not to bother with that old DB knowledge) essentially try to skip the whole learning the basics thing, and then to paradoxically try to pretend that one&#x27;s knowledge is a step above.

The router can do a read or write to SRAM per cycle AND allows a passthrough to another core in the same cycle.<p>Our chip-to-chip interconnect is a custom 64 bit (72 lane) parallel interface allowing 48GB/s. There are two of these (unidirectional) interfaces per side, giving you a total of 8 of these interfaces per chip.",1416938627

They didn’t know us and it looked too good to be true.</i><p>You could pay $25/hour for some product interviews, but how long does that last? Say someone does 4 interviews with you for a total of $200. Housecleaning for a new client might pay less per hour, but it also has the potential to be a steady gig which might yield a few thousand a year in additional income whereas this app probably won&#x27;t. One also has to factor in the non-negligible time cost of getting to and from the interview. It&#x27;s not really enough for someone to get excited about unless they have nothing else going on; people who work hard place a high value on their limited leisure time, and giving product design interviews sounds more like a way for the interviewer to pad a resume than anything that will deliver a long-term benefit to the interviewee.<p>As someone who spent quite a lot of time at the bottom of the economic pyramid, doing similarly casual labor, there&#x27;s probably not a lot of value that an app cobbled together in a few months can deliver. The most useful things you can do with a smartphone are:<p>1. receive calls, email and text messages<p>2. Maps app and public transit scheduling to get you to your gigs on time<p>3. web browsing to check Craigslist<p>Those three things deliver a <i>lot</i> of value because they save a <i>lot</i> of time. It&#x27;s unlikely that a shallow app is going to deliver anything like as much utility, and the utility it does add has to be weighed against the time it takes to use.<p>After that your income comes down to knowing whatever job it is that you do and being able to set prices and stick to them. The latter is quite important; some people are a pleasure to do business with, others will try and beat you down or trick you out of money. I&#x27;ve had people that owed $150 for furniture removal lie about the rate they negotiated and try to pay only $100, and when called out on it they shrugged and said &#x27;no harm in trying.&#x27; That&#x27;s a lot harder to deal with for someone who doesn&#x27;t have English as a first language or the confidence to call someone&#x27;s bluff.<p>The best way to empower a poor person is to teach them something that allows them to charge more money, which is typically a different skill as low-paid laborers tend to be price takers more than price makers and competition is friendly but intense. Short of a new work skill, the other thing a lot of poor people could benefit from is a basic course in microeconomics from a labor perspective - not so they can quote Adam Smith but so they have a consistent way to model things like opportunity cost and production possibilities and make decisions in less time instead of puzzling over things and wondering if they could have made a better deal.<p>Not everyone can do this, but basic micro does not involve a lot of math and gives people a systematic way to think about the economic problems that they already face on a regular basis. Developing a course based on the practical problems like deciding which of two mutually exclusive jobs to take or how to maximize profit would have enormous value. For a housecleaner, say, you could figure out that offering &#x27;natural cleaning products&#x27; might have a cost in both consumables and additional cleaning time amounting to $4/hour, but clients who care about that may be willing to pay an extra $5/hour (or more), yielding greater profits.",1416938615

5888819,comment,5886686,5888738,1,0,grey-area,,,"That phrase says nothing about root or xterm and I think you&#x27;re being misleading by attempting to paraphrase it that way though I think I see how you got there. That&#x27;s one possible interpretation of it (though not one Greenwald has backed), but it&#x27;s equally possible, given the assertions of Snowden in the video with the article (which we now know to be true at least for phone calls), that it was an attempt to describe the experience of an analyst using such a system, requesting full access to a user&#x27;s account, and getting it without interacting with google staff (after what delay we don&#x27;t know), possibly without any legal paperwork other than making the request. We simply don&#x27;t know enough details to be able to describe the process any better, we don&#x27;t even know all the possible sources of intel for it.<p>Since Greenwald provided the sources for his statement and the article clearly indicates which quotes are attribution and which bits are commentary I didn&#x27;t interpret it the way you did, and do think it&#x27;s highly misleading to characterise this as a fundamental flaw in the article, or as something the guardian has &#x27;walked back&#x27; - the guardian is not a monolithic entity and features content from all sorts of contradictory viewpoints. The writer wasn&#x27;t clueless about technology necessarily - remember this sort of writing goes through many hands on the way to publication, and attempts to synthesise knowledge from various sources for a non-technical audience, while not revealing damaging details which could leave them open to prosecution. That process is going to result in text which is not as precise or illuminating as we or the writer would like.<p>So I&#x27;m all for correcting reporters like Greenwald where they over-reach or imply too much, and I do think he should have clarified this particular detail which has been left very vague, but we should clarify or correct, not attack and patronise, reporters who don&#x27;t specify technical details, and bear in mind that technical questions of mechanism are not the only story here; there are far more important legal and ethical questions.",1371398258

5888809,comment,5886898,5887884,1,0,VLM,,,"On a extremely big picture 50000 foot level, there&#x27;s the windows model where you put everything into one piece of software and you run that one piece of software on one server (real or virtual).  Its philosophically anti-windows to have more than one piece of software installed per OS.  So you want a &quot;something&quot; and a database server, well now you need two installs / licenses / hardware / images / admins / whatever not just one.  And in windows philosophy you never run user stuff on a server anyway so right there you may have issues with a &quot;user&quot; app and a &quot;server&quot; db system requiring two systems.<p>Its hardly all peaches and unicorns on the unix side either.  Seriously, you&#x27;re going to install 17 completely separate, different versions of &quot;magic embedded mysql&quot; or whatever, and have no way to do joins across DB servers or system wide DB backup system?  Crazy talk.  Why not have every programmer write their own homemade strcmp() complete with different buffer overflow bugs on each version...  So the whole concept of a &quot;private&quot; database violates quite a few unix philosophy principles.  Handling multiple versions of DBs across different distros is a puzzler for the devs rather than just including one version and calling it good.<p>The whole mess from the 100K standpoint is DBs and DB apps are too new, too much technical churn, too much incompatibility.  For example, why are you installing a new DB and replacing all your API code if all you want is a different engine perhaps (or perhaps not) better suited to your workload?  Its conceptually like switching your whole infrastructure to a new word processor in 1985.",1371398138

5888794,comment,5886344,5887228,4,0,Lagged2Death,,,"Nixon&#x27;s goon squads were reprehensible, but they involved a small number of actors and a small number of actions. It&#x27;s not strictly incorrect to refer to those actors as &quot;the government,&quot; but it&#x27;s a little misleading. Nixon didn&#x27;t brief congress on his burglary program. It wasn&#x27;t a matter of official policy. When these activities were brought to light, the citizens were the <i>first</i> to know. The bulk of &quot;the government&quot; was just as shocked as we were. No one seriously tried to defend the actions as somehow legal because of a state of national emergency.<p>The current <i>official policy</i>, which has spanned at least two and possibly three presidential administrations, is to use a huge network of government employees and private sector labor working together to spy on virtually every single person in the country, continuously, for years. And this time, it&#x27;s been sort of an open secret, endorsed and defended as legal from the highest levels, and known to Senators and rank-and-file FBI agents alike. We, the ordinary citizens, were the last to know.<p>I think it&#x27;s much more accurate to describe the current surveillance as an activity of &quot;the government,&quot; and I think the scale, the audacity, the hubris involved makes it clear that an awful lot of &quot;the government&quot; views the fourth amendment as an outdated relic that must be stamped out or revised away into meaninglessness.<p>I think the difference between the two examples is extreme and obvious.

5888775,comment,5888398,5888398,26,0,jmillikin,,,"For those who don&#x27;t regularly follow rachelbythebay.com, this post is a Google allegory. I disagree with a couple points.<p>First, Google really doesn&#x27;t care as much about education as people think they do. They do love experience. I never graduated high school, and was hired into an SRE position (= programmer writing large-scale sysadmin tools) based on previous work experience. Grades are only useful if you&#x27;ve got nothing else to show off.<p>Second, if you want employees to be loyal to a company with unusually good perks, taking them fresh out of school is a terrible approach. Many people working here indeed have no real idea what working at non-tech companies is like, and that means they assume every other company is like Google. I have heard stories of employees getting frustrated on some project, leaving to work at (e.g.) a bank or webdev shop, and not realizing until their first day that there&#x27;s no free food, or gym, or weekly heckling of the CEO. I used to work at a defense contractor, I know what it&#x27;s like being a programmer employed at a non-tech company, and I don&#x27;t want to ever go back.<p>(In other words, Google might get better retention by implementing Rumspringa)<p>Third, the proprietary parts aren&#x27;t as pervasive as the article portrays. Our Linux kernel has weird Google-specific interfaces, but they&#x27;re always in some stage of upstreaming and will eventually be in Linus&#x27;s trunk. Our RPC system uses the same protobuf rpc-stubs that are generated by the open-source protobuf compiler. Desktops and Laptops run stock {Ubuntu,Windows,MacOS} with a few extra binaries. MapReduce and BigTable were published and inspired dozens of open-source implementations. Many of our Python-based tools have web frontends written with Django. Many systems persist data in MySQL.<p>When Google engineers avoid particular in-fashion systems such as Rails or MongoDB or node.js, it&#x27;s not because we&#x27;re ignorant of them, it&#x27;s because we think they&#x27;re not good enough.",1371397295

In other words, this isn’t “warrantless wiretapping” so much as “general warrant wiretapping.” They can’t just tap any old call or read any old e-mail they strikes them as “suspicious.” They’ve got to be flagging content for interception because they believe it’s covered by a particular §702 authorization, and observe whatever “targeting procedures” the FISA Court has established for the relevant authorization....</i><p><i>None of that would be too surprising in principle: That’s the whole point of §702! It means analysts get discretion to decide what particular accounts fall under a very broad order. A key question, of course, is just what the checks in the process are. Can an analyst technically (if not legally) plug in any selector to start collecting on and just start getting material? Does anyone check their work before call and e-mail content starts flowing in? How closely are their error rates checked after it does? Again, legally, they don’t have a blank check, but it’s the details of the system architecture that determine whether you’d be able to tell the difference in practice.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.juliansanchez.com/2013/06/15/nadler-and-mueller-on-analysts-getting-call-and-e-mail-content/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.juliansanchez.com/2013/06/15/nadler-and-mueller-o...</a>",1371397109

I am a high school teacher, and I have considered switching to programming.&quot;<p>&quot;There&#x27;s a lot to be said for stability and security, but there&#x27;s also a lot to be said for keeping yourself excited to be alive, with your family.&quot;<p>(Absolutely 100% correct. If you are not happy and fulfilled it&#x27;s not good for your kids or your marriage.)<p>&quot;Switching jobs and switching careers is a lot different as a parent than as a single person.&quot;<p>Let me say this (knowing a few people who spent their entire working career teaching and are now rotting away in apathy and mediocrity). If you are going to make the switch <i>now</i> is the time to do this. When you have one child who is 2 years old. Once you have more children and they are older the chance of it happening (especially with the golden handcuffs of a tenured teaching job if that is what you have) approaches 0.<p>The time to act is now. You will also have to decide (because from following the links on your profile it looks like you live in a pretty nice place) whether you are willing to give up that geography for giving yourself possibly a more challenging career path. Obligatory: &quot;And only you can make that decision&quot;.<p>I can tell you this though. If you do something that has a bigger upside (financially and intellectually) than teaching it will open up an entire world of possibilities for you and your family that in the end might be more beneficial. You have to think long term. One day your kids will be older and move on. (And in fact they will change once they go through puberty but that&#x27;s a different story all together).<p>My advice just knowing what I know from what you wrote (and what I see after a quick look) is to consider seriously switching careers. You can always fall back on teaching (so we are not talking about the downside risk of turning down admission to Harvard or anything.)",1371397065

Since the land was all owned by a smallish number of landowners, the only way to make a living if you were not one of them was to work someone else&#x27;s land, on terms largely dictated by them, so economics effectively tied peasants to the manorial lord.<p>I&#x27;ll see if I can dig up the source, but I read an interesting analysis specifically of the transition to feudalism in late-Roman Italy.

Remember why you&#x27;re never supposed to run Apache as root? Or why you should never give PHP scripts permission to write to any location outside of the upload folder? Root and web-access don&#x27;t mix, period. In the VPS business it&#x27;s a kind of necessary evil, but that&#x27;s all the more reason to check if the survival of your business depends on a bunch of unsanitized SQL queries.<p>Back in 2009, before SolusVM came along, the most popular control panel for low-end VPS hosts was called HyperVM. One day in the summer of that year, HyperVM got hacked, or more accurately, a combination of slow updates and weak passwords caused major data loss at a popular low-end VPS host. The next day, the developer of HyperVM, an Indian man, committed suicide. There was a lot of publicity surrounding the incident, and many low-end VPS hosts went looking for a less infamous control panel.<p>Then came SolusVM. I can&#x27;t remember exactly how it came to be the primary replacement for HyperVM, but almost overnight everyone adopted SolusVM. I&#x27;m actually surprised that it lasted nearly 4 years without a major security incident like this. The low-end VPS market is so crowded with assholes and 14-year-olds looking for a quick buck, the so-called companies exchange DDoS attacks every other day. Now that the easiest route into another company&#x27;s servers has been published, expect them to start hacking one another into oblivion.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;m already starting to wonder what kind of flying PHP-spaghetti-code monster whose name is /^[A-Za-z]{5}VM$/ will come to replace SolusVM for the next 4 years or so. It probably won&#x27;t be much more secure, since most of the kids have budgets that are too tight to buy proper software. Developers who know how to use prepared statements cost money. Auditing a complex piece of web app costs even more money.<p>Writing control panels is hard. Remember, even Linode sometimes gets it wrong.

Not to get into too much detail, but the lower ranks of feudal nobility were &quot;lords of manors&quot; (with higher ranks being lords of lords). The manor system (manorialism[1]) was the economic foundation of feudal society. Back when I studied history (many years ago), I read one the most fascinating history papers I&#x27;ve ever read: <i>The Rise of Dependent Cultivation and Seignorial Institutions</i> by Marc Bloch[2] (I couldn&#x27;t find a free version online). There was little, if any, violence directed at peasants - certainly not one meant to get them to work. The entire system was founded on the fact that peasants had little choice: they didn&#x27;t own the land, and it was hard for them to relocate to other manors.<p>Systems built around direct coercion, with the threat of violence, are rarely stable. Successful exploitation is one whose targets either hardly feel or one that&#x27;s not bad enough to get them to rebel. The way these systems often collapse is that over time, the exploiters feel more confident to exploit even more, until they reach a breaking point at which a rebellion occurs.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/histories/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139054423&cid=CBO9781139054423A009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/histories/ch...</a>",1371396145

Most companies are only too happy to help, and will bend right over -- especially after whoever the boogieman of the day is has appeared on the news lately.  They wouldn&#x27;t want to be seen as not doing thier utmost to help fight the good fight.<p>Compulsion is the second easiest and second most legal way.  This way is also politically, legally and psychologically desirable for them, because they would like to push the envelope of what is considered legitimate surveillance.<p>Apart from asking and compelling companies, they could just tap the fiber, or use other direct and indirect methods of surveillance.  This is really what they do best, and what their original and primary mission has always been: mostly to spy on foreign governments and their agents.  After all, the NSA isn&#x27;t going to get very far asking or trying to compel China to give them a tap in to their data centers.  So they&#x27;ll have to find some other way to do it.  And if you think they&#x27;re going to have a hard time doing it in their own back yard as compared to a hostile country, you might want to reconsider.",1371395169

I know exactly the frustrations you are experiencing. But don&#x27;t ever forget that you are doing a noble thing by staying in this job to support your family. That is a great sacrifice you should take pride in. It shows your dedication to your family. That is an important success you have already accomplished. And don&#x27;t forget Einstein made a lot of important discoveries while working as a Swiss patent clerk!<p>In my opinion, the first thing you should do is eliminate this feeling you have of being &quot;trapped&quot;. Why? Because it clouds your thinking and judgement. You may feel trapped, but that is not completely true. What&#x27;s great about software development is that you only need a computer and an internet connection and you have many, many options. But, are you prepared for any option when it arrives?<p>The right thing to do now is continue working this job to support your family while you explore and learn about other options. That may take months. For example, have you built up a body of work on GitHub? Have you contributed to any open-source projects? Have you created an iPhone or Android app? Do you need to brush up on data structures and algorithms? What about learning a new language?<p>Once you are fully prepared, you will see any potential options unfold naturally instead of through a feeling of desperation.<p>“Change the way you look at things and the things you look at change.”",1371395132

As they say it is a good alternative to fopen:  <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html</a> - it is not a project goal to be a complete SQL implementation or to be a drop in replacement for MySQL/Postgres/Oracle etc<p>SQLite&#x27;s manifest typing is a complication for ALTER TABLE that doesn&#x27;t affect other databases.<p>On the ORM side, my point was that layers of abstraction and indirection will make things harder.  Is your statement that they would have to have SQLite specific code the only reason why it isn&#x27;t done, or is there something else considered hard?<p>While it is true your voice isn&#x27;t heard, enough people do post to sqlite-users to get some idea of what the various issues are and a rough idea of their popularity.  For example a far more common issue is that SQLite does not work well if you use a networked filesystem (you will eventually get corruption).<p>Timeliness is a practical issue.  ALTER TABLE can&#x27;t be used until it is available.  The way the SQLite developers consider best practise is you embed the SQLite library statically inside your app and you write specifically to SQLite:  <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html</a><p>There are no legal or technical reasons preventing anyone to cause this to be implemented separately from the SQLite core.  Wanting it to be part of the core is very different.<p>You seem to have an underlying assumption of zero sum games or SQLite being in some competition with all other database engines.  It isn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t lose by developers using MySQL or MongoDB.  Heck I use MongoDB far more than I use SQLite.  Developers who need comprehensive ALTER TABLE support and find the copy table with modifications approach too onerous are far outside of SQLite&#x27;s sweet spot.  That is ok.",1371394916

I was going to blog about it but I&#x27;ll jot down my thoughts here.<p>At the moment we have companies making all sorts of set-top boxes, games consoles and media boxes which come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. It seems to me that we can rely on corporations to build user friendly devices for us to consume media.<p>What we (as citizens) rather than as consumers need is a comms box or a social box or whatever it gets called. Some mentioned &quot;personal data box&quot; on here or words to that effect.<p>We want (I&#x27;m going out on a limb to speak for other around here) secure, federated and private communications: chat communication (instant messaging), mail communication (email), audio communication (voice over ip), video communication (video over ip). Also we&#x27;d ideally like our digital social interactions kept secure, federated and private. Finally secure and private online storage of documents would be nice if only for convenience. And to top it all off what would be super-delicious would be a workable single sign-on thingy for the internet age. Please, pretty please? We only have to solve this once. We&#x27;re at the threshold of the digital age, future generations will thank us for solving these problems when the issues cam e to a head (as they are now).<p>What is needed for all this is _open federated protocols_. And the corporations that flog proprietary offerings have to embrace these protocols. As far as I can see we have those protocols for email (smtp+tls+...?), for voice over ip (sip), chat (jabber?), social (open soical?), online document storage (?), single sign on (openid?)<p>We need all this in a box that people can just connect to the net via their router using wifi or whatever. We need it to be peer to peer so that large portions of it cannot be bought out and centralized after the fact. We need to shout loudly when companies roll back on support of open protocols.<p>We need this in a box. My personal social comms box. I dunno. It seems like a huge but vital need. But we only need to get it right once. We can&#x27;t trust those in power not to abuse this tech, there will always be an erosion of checks and balances so we need to build a technical solution while we struggle for better social and legal norms.<p>Who&#x27;s with me?",1371394825

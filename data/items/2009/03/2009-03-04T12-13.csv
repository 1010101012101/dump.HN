I’d just caution about assuming TV=American TV. Sure, the US situation is as interesting as hell but you’re missing a lot of cool stuff happening in other places. Looking at the global impact of a profoundly disruptive technology it helps to take a more global perspective.<p>I spent most of my youth working in network TV, then moved to talk radio and the last 15 years in internet, most recently running the online video output for a newspaper publisher.  I moved to that job explicitly because I wanted to have a hand on the knife that killed broadcast TV. Always wanted to live in the future, to do what I could to bring it on, and I saw the power of the networks as retarding at best and toxic at worst. Couple of years down the track, I realize things ain’t that simple.  I no longer see a simple dualism, TV vs the Internet. Audiences are not fleeing one monolithic platform for another, they are fragmenting. This is how Nielsen can find that TV consumption is at record highs (151hrs/wk in US, according to a Feb 09 survey) while internet usage is also rising. God only knows what crap is in that 151 hours, but the same can be said of internet video.<p>There’s a new ecology of media emerging, as a profusion of digitally networked screens fill our living rooms, pockets, desks, cars and hands. To my eternal joy it doesn’t look like it will settle to an ossified steady state any time soon, unlike TV and Radio which have been using the same model for 70 and 50 years respectively.<p>Now I think the internet will no more kill TV than TV killed radio or radio killed cinema. Despite DVDs and huge plasmas, cinema is doing just fine. There’ll be less money for the successors of broadcast networks, fewer ad dollars split more ways: so inevitably less money not just for the corporates but also for the production crews and creatives. Cheaper TV. We will have an ecology: a whole lot of fizzing and spitting new beasties have crawled out of the media swamp and the big old beasties (a) don’t like the look of it at all, they don’t play by the rules, and (b) don’t realize being eaten alive by ants is still being eaten alive.  Many of the networks will collapse; certainly the corporate structures are unsustainable, but people will still want communal big-screen narrative experiences, and will want them well made. That costs money and takes, for better or worse, concentrations of expertise, machines and skills that cost money.<p>We make short feature material, quite profitably, subverting a;ll the TV [production models we can, but have discovered where the bottom limit for professional ad-supported shortform online video is.. and it’s higher than you think. Any fool can make a video and whack it up on YouTube as a hobby, and not make a living. To make hundreds of videos over a span of years, supporting several staff  and turn a profit is not so easy. Fortunately  the audience fragmentation means we can turn a buck from any number of iterations, including broadcast TV.<p>Network TV ain’t dead, you can’t kill it with a stick, it’s a zombie which has no brain to speak of  yet hungers for yours. It’s going to be with us for a long time yet: but as one of the crowd, not the bully on the block.",1236171466

502829,comment,502809,502809,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Since you explicitly mentioned C# and F#, I'd suggest OCaml. There's a free translation of a French O'Reilly book, _Developing applications with Objective Caml_, at <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/</a> (the site seems to be down for me at the moment). The first few chapters focus on functional programming, then imperative programming, then compare their strengths, weaknesses, and when using each is most appropriate. (OOP and others are covered later in the book.) It's a pretty good intro to FP, imho.<p>Once you know FP techniques, you can apply them in many languages people don't tend to think of as functional (though tail-call optimization helps, and support for higher-order functions is all but necessary); I write strongly FP-influenced code in Lua, for example.<p>Scheme is also an <i>utterly</i> fantastic language, but I'm going to defer recommendations there to others.

502828,comment,502571,502571,0,0,BSeward,,,"I suspect #tweetmyjobs is trending simply because TweetMyJobs' many accounts hashtag it to every post they make. Their posts are automatically-generated got-to-fit-in-140 gobbledygook, and several of their accounts that I checked have been suspended presumably for their repetitive nonsense content. It looks like a developed-by-the-lowest-bidder infrastructure designed by people who haven't really thought things through (you're expected to register an account in order to see the list of Twitter accounts? And can only browse job descriptions by visiting those Twitter accounts and then clicking a shortlink that then links back to the site?). TweetMyJobs is, as far as I can tell, a mess. They're getting publicity only because their hashtag hit some Twitter mindshare event horizon and gave people something to talk about without needing to investigate too much on their own.<p>So, uh, I appreciate that you're focusing on making yours more useful. Long-term approval usually comes from products made with care.<p>While searching for a job, I physically am usually limited to a few applicable dimensions (physical location, field, experience range). If I could tailor the experience on Twhired to target those dimensions then it would make my interactions much more effective. A focus on mining or transcribing accurate location and field metadata plus an interface for drilling down based on those would be a good way to fit my needs as a user.",1236170718

Getting the cryptography right is important, but end-to-end security is also important -- the ideal outcome here would be if a new DNSSEC2 was created which used djb's curve25519 instead of RSA1024, but I don't think this is very likely to happen any time soon.",1236170679

502808,comment,502655,502655,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Just to clarify: the problem here is wave collapse. Wave collapse happens at an instant of time, and therefore picks a frame of reference. The wavefunction changes instantaneously over all space when ""measurement"" occurs, and does not obey the Schrodinger equation (or relativistic equivalent).<p>The ""intriguing development"" by Rovelli is that he used decoherence to explain measurement probabilities in some relativistic model. Time still exists in this model (which lives over R^{3+1}), but nothing happens instantaneously. Basically, he showed that the relativistic schrodinger equation gives the same experimental predictions as wave collapse.",1236169668

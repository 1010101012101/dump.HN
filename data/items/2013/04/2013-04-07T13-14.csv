5507199,comment,5506571,5506899,10,0,groovy2shoes,,,"Halo (at least the first one) wasn't completely serious.  The Covenant often said and did silly things, as did your fellow marines if you shot them.  The graphics were also more vibrantly colorful than any game in the Quake series.  Microsoft even threw resources at Rooster Teeth for producing Red vs Blue, which is an absolutely silly and hilarious series.<p>Halo 2 brought some of the best multiplayer I've ever seen on a console.  In Halo 3, they added a ranking system that attempted to keep the online experience fun for newbs and veterans alike.<p>Furthermore, not all modern blockbusters are self-serious. The Borderlands, Portal, and Team Fortress 2 come to mind as shooters that are completely and utterly silly.  Gears of War has a little whimsy, too, though perhaps not enough for your tastes -- a chainsaw bayonet on the end of an assault rifle? Whimsy!<p>I understand your frustrations with modern mass-market gaming, but they're neither Halo's nor Microsoft's fault. This is how capitalism works.  Maybe the market shift is temporary, leaving you in a niche for a while until the indie movement becomes large enough to push the ""grittily"" realistic games out of the way.  Or maybe it's permanent, in which case you'll be stuck in the indie niche forever.  At least the Xbox Live Arcade has no shortage of whimsical indie games to play.",1365342813

Hidden menus, hidden options...  I know they can't copy iphone/android's user interface elements because of patents, though.  Plus everything is so slow - launching apps, loading web pages, etc.  Things that hinder both average and power users include having two desktops, two control panels, two versions of most apps (the metro one usually being very crippled), and having no start button in the windows 7-like desktop anymore.  Add onto all that the lack of apps, the un-user-friendly behavior, like shutting down without asking, including while I was trying to record a meeting in onenote - the expensive desktop version, not the free metro version, which doesn't include the ability to add audio anymore.  Luckily I was also recording it on my android phone - had no problem, shared the audio file to dropbox and emailed the link to others.

Maybe a game that brings out the tragic aspects of war -- not just as shocking gore, but as sadness and horror.

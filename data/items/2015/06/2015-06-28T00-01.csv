9792016,comment,9790115,9791509,0,0,crdb,,,"This is not at all how I understood the riots. Roughly: a bus driver arrived in an area where people were partying in the street, and refused to let in a very intoxicated fellow. This fellow somehow ended up in front of the bus (I think he decided to lie there) and got run over by the driver (I doubt intentionally). As is customary in the country of origin of said partying folks, the crowd got angry and &quot;defended&quot; its own. Within two hours, the police had restored peace.<p>After examining the situation, the government decided to make street drinking illegal in the area during the hours where further flash mobs were likely, and restricted alcohol sales island-wide during night hours (10.30pm - 7.30am).<p>Now, the suspects happened to be one race and the driver another, but people weren&#x27;t protesting for racial reasons, it was a drunk crowd flashing up after it got sparked that happened to be mostly from a couple countries.<p>This is in stark contrast to, say, the 1964 race riots and similar riots around the region at that time against the Straits Chinese in Indonesia and Malaysia, or more recently, Ferguson in the US, which were explicitly about race. I suspect that the context of the Singapore riots was then lost on journalists who couldn&#x27;t resist fitting them into their more common narrative of race or class based protest.",1435452491

9791996,comment,9789860,9791782,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"I&#x27;m not a day trader, but I do trade, and I think I know enough about it that I can sketch an answer for you.<p>You have to learn to manage your own psychology, so that you can stay calm under stress and minimize errors.  This is far easier said than done.  In particular, you have to overcome certain human instincts we have regarding risk.  People prefer a small certain gain to the possibility of a much larger gain in the future; conversely, we will accept the possibility of a large loss in the future in order to avoid a small but certain loss now.  Both of these attitudes are ruinous for traders.<p>Most people have to have a system -- perhaps, multiple systems.  A system is a set of rules for buying and selling that give you a statistical edge over the market.  Here is an example system.  <i>This is only an example -- it will not actually make money.  Do not try to trade it!</i>  You take two moving averages over two different time frames -- say, the last 15 minutes and the last hour.  When the shorter-term average goes above the longer-term average, you buy, and when it goes below the longer-term average, you sell.  Systems get much more complex than this, but perhaps this will give you the idea.<p>A completed trade gives you a gain or loss proportional to the amount of money you placed at risk (let&#x27;s ignore commissions and slippage for now -- they&#x27;re usually minor).  The amount at risk is normally controlled using stop orders, which close the trade automatically if the price trades below a specified level (or above a specified level, for short positions).  Call the amount at risk, R.  Then the result of each trade can be characterized as the gain divided by R; this is called an R-multiple.  A trading <i>system</i>, when used repeatedly, generates a distribution of R-multiples, which can be characterized by a histogram; a typical system generates a lot of trades between -1R and 0, a smaller number between 0 and 1R, a still smaller number between 1R and 2R, etc.  It&#x27;s possible for systems to have win rates (the ratio of winning trades to losing trades) less than 50%, but still be profitable because they generate enough multi-R gains.<p>Once you have a profitable system, you then have to decide how much to risk on each trade.  The more risk you take, the larger your potential profit, but also the greater your chance of a significant drawdown if your system generates a string of losing trades -- as it will from time to time.  Risking between .5% and 2% of capital on each trade seems to be the usual range AFAIK.  If that doesn&#x27;t sound like much, consider that a day trader may make 4 or 5 completed trades per day.  If their system has a .5R expectancy (average R-multiple) and they risk 1% per trade on 4 trades, their expected gain on the day is 2%.  With compounding, and given 20 trading days in a month, such a trader can make almost 50% on their capital <i>per month</i>.  This level of success is very unusual, but not unheard-of.<p>And if making 4 or 5 trades a day sounds like you would spend a lot of time just sitting around watching the markets and waiting for the right moment to strike, then you have the right idea :-)",1435452049

9791992,comment,9789860,9791881,0,0,log_n,,,"Yup, orders that are placed well outside the bid/ask just fill every order in the order book until they are filled.  It&#x27;s commonly called sweeping the market and happens on 1-2 ticks (price levels) around the best bid/ask pretty commonly throughout the day depending on the product.  Limit order books are actually really fun things to model and the rules around different exchanges books are quite neat.<p>The problem with disallowing your trader from ripping through a lot of the levels of an order book is that it can be a risk reducing move and what you intend to do sometimes.  This trade is a clear fat finger but there are times when you will want to sweep the book to get hedged.<p>For instance, let&#x27;s say your desk just got slammed with a ton of risk on an OTC (over the counter) option trade.  You can immediately alleviate a lot of that risk (while paying through the nose) by selling 2000 contracts or 5 price levels of the ES (SP500 future).  You can immediately place that order and get it filled and be hedged.  If there were multiple points of human intervention required then you might lose a substantial amount of money.  2k contracts on the ES is $25,000 a tick.  If word leaks that people are going to need to start hedging big then it could easily move 10 or 20 ticks away from you while waiting for your risk management team to approve your trade as not a fat finger.<p>Generally it&#x27;s cheaper to just fire error prone traders.  Heh, and anyone that is about to execute a 2k contract option trade generally has their hedge order queued up and ready to send to the market as soon as they hear the other side agree to their price.",1435451946

9791986,comment,9790633,9791026,0,0,nitrogen,,,"The solution to the halting problem is to stop building universal/Turing-complete machines.<p><i>Edit:</i> since this was downvoted, I will elaborate.  The halting problem only applies to <i>arbitrary</i> programs on Turing-complete systems.  It is possible to create useful systems that are not Turing complete.  As a baseline example, it is easy to tell that the following Ruby program halts:<p><pre><code>    exit
</code></pre>
Problems arise when one allows unbounded loops and unbounded recursion.  If all loops and all recursions are provably finite, then a program can be proven to exit.  All sorts of useful things can be done with systems composed of small, provably terminating programs.  And it turns out, the vast majority (if not all) of the things relevant to securing a computer system can be implemented in formally provable ways.",1435451843

Yet, I <i>do</i> give credit in more thorough discussions on INFOSEC history because the architecture was pretty awesome for Intel. Then, they watered that down with BiiN&#x27;s i960MX. Then, even less radical (in security) Itanium. They lost hundreds of man years on the first, around a billion on second w/ Siemens, and at least $100 mil sunk into Itanium w/ HP.<p>Intel certainly tried to make up for their x86 monstrosity several times. They got smarter and smarter about how they did so in terms of market acceptance. A combination of engineering mistakes and foolish market choices (imho) made them pay. As you said, they learned to give customers the insecure garbage they wanted or risk extremely large losses.

I am a scientist who aligns himself with original Nazi thought, which came from the founders of the political party, as well as from those who influenced those founders, namely German philosophers who wrote big, dense books. From this, you can take the fact that I care (and do so pretty much to the exclusion of all else) about making progress, by which I mean humans directing their evolution in a positive manner. Therefore, the only people I hate are the ones who purposely do not do the best that they can with what they have, and those who intentionally commit acts which impede progress. The latter is why I care deeply about defeating censorship, in every form.<p>If someone truly cares about progress, and there's something that we can do together, then I'll gladly work with them. It wouldn't matter to me if they also just happen to be a jew or a homosexual or anything else which nazis apparently hate. The bottom line is that real Nazis care about progress, and if the original ones had today's scientific knowledge, they likely would have had different attitudes towards race and sex. Think about it: They didn't even know about DNA. If Nazism had started fifty years later, Mein Kampf would have been profoundly different. By attempting to disparage me, through inference, you align yourself, accidentally, with today's nazis, because you both see Nazism only from a historical perspective, one which cannot possibly grow with new knowledge.<p>I have contributed positively to HN, so there is no reason for me to be banned, and you calling for that to happen is very nazi-like. If you want to know more about me, you should look at the three links answering the question of whether I am a Nazi, which are located on the first link on my website, and which I shall repeat here as #2a, #2b and #2c.<p>The research I was asked to do was merely to check on whether an allegation was a fact, as part of a greater effort of due diligence, an effort being conducted by others, those who would make a decision based on all of the facts obtained. I don't directly work for the university, and I dislike most universities because I see their policies as being against progress. I also have no personal opinion about that man, and that will not change, regardless of what I find out about him.<p>#1: Notice the lowercase ""n"", which I use to identify those nazis who I do not consider to be ""real"", which is in the sense of when I use uppercase ""N"".<p>#2a: <a href=""http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2240268/532905771"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2240268/532905771</a><p>#2b: <a href=""http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2240268/519933389"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2240268/519933389</a><p>#2c: <a href=""http://djangodurango.com/?p=46"" rel=""nofollow"">http://djangodurango.com/?p=46</a>",1321213742

Size has unambiguous meaning down to the Planck scale (10^-35 meters) and electrons simply haven't been probed at scales smaller than 10^-22 meters.  They could very well have heretofore-undetected structure (e.g. preon models) on the scales of 10^-20 while still have <i>fifteen orders of magnitude</i>  (about the relative span between an atom and the radius of the earth) over which distances are perfectly sensible.<p>Likewise, before the deep inelastic scattering experiments of the 60's, physicist had no direct evidence that neutrons and protons had any internal structure.  All they could say is ""we know that if they have internal structure, it's smaller than this length scale"".<p>[FYI: The Planck scale is (<i>arguably!</i>) where the notion of size becomes murky because quantum fluctuations in the background spacetime (against which the sizes of things are measured) become substantial.  Of course, no one has ever seen (even indirect) evidence of a quantum fluctuation in spacetime.  And, as is well known, appling quantum mechanics to gravity and spacetime is full of difficulties.  But most physicists believe there are such quantum effects because it seems damn near impossible to reconcile a classical spacetime with quantum everything else.]",1321213234

The ""colors"" (which are just suggestive names and have nothing to do with light colors) are Red, Green, and Blue, along with anti-Red, anti-Green, and anti-Blue.  Therefore, there are basically two options: mesons, which contain a quark/anti-quark pair (e.g. one Green and one anti-Green) and baryons, which contain quark of each colors (RGB, or antiRGB).  Tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and hexaquarks have been searched for in experiment and would not violate the colorless rule, but have never been found.  Physicists would prefer to be able to calculate from first principles whether such states are possible, but it turns out that no one knows how to do the calculation because of the non-perturbative nature of the strong force.<p>[Many caveats.  For instance, any given hadron (the collective name for things made of quarks, which to date means only mesons and baryons) is not actually made up of quarks with definite color, but rather a quantum superposition of many possibilities.  I think mesons, for example, are always a balanced superposition of R-antiR, G-antiG, and B-antiB.  So you could never point to a given meson in an experiment and say ""that meson was blue-antiblue"".]",1321212658

Do you currently upsell/cros-sell your customers?  Do you have any plans to do so?  Would you ever be interested in reselling other companies products/services to your customer base?<p>How important is your brand?  Having more customers can increase the perceived value of your brand.  Customers can be a source of future growth through referrals, partnerships, etc.<p>For example, if one of your reseller's clients really likes your product is that brand value going to accrue to him or you?  Or does it even matter in your space?<p>Sorry I can't be more specific, all I'm offering here are questions.  If they prompt a thought or two that helps you negotiate a better deal then that's awesome, if not then I hope I didn't waste too much of your time.",1321212108

3231501,comment,3231223,3231223,12,0,nhashem,,,"I'm getting increasingly convinced that AdWords is basically a scam.  I worked on SEM optimization tools for two companies in the mid-2000s and ROI was great.  Then ROI started to erode as the years passed as other players in our vertical entered our space, and as far we could tell, they were either a) just spending to make a huge brand play or b) had some way to monetize 150% than us because their CPCs were literally 150% higher.<p>My theory is that since SEM is often a separate unit from every other marketing organization in a company, this is what happens: The SEM team sets up an AdWords campaign, get great ROI on terms that contain their company's name or whatever, and crappy ROI on everything else.  But the campaigns as a whole are ROI-positive, and because they're all being evaluated on that, no one will ever suggest, ""hey, I know our company name is Joe's Widgets and we get great ROI on keywords like 'joes widgets,' but maybe we shouldn't buy that keyword at all because anyone searching for that will also see us as the #1 organic Google result.""  Because if the SEM team did that then their campaigns would no longer be ROI positive even if the company as a whole would benefit, and working for unprofitable departments is generally not good for your career.<p>Now I'm working at a company that's a major AdSense publisher and at least once a quarter something happens where we get a huge clawback for ""quality issues we can't disclose,"" or we have to change our implementation, or whatever.  It's just totally infuriating and I've realized there must be a lot of people like me who have basically spent their entire career being Google's bitch on the traffic acquisition side or monetization side.<p>I'm not so worried about monetization, as there is more than one way to make money from the internet besides AdSense.  But as far as AdWords, I'm wondering if there's going to finally be some sort of tipping point where the mid-sized companies that have gotten squeezed out of AdWords find some other paid traffic provider that isn't infested by a) huge companies just making stupid brand players and b) small players blowing their $100 credit like what is described by the OP.<p>What would such a traffic provider look like?  They have to be search PPC (again, lots of options for non-search paid traffic), they have to have enough volume, they have to have the technology to combat things like click fraud, and they have to be called something else besides Bing/Yahoo (which unfortunately have all the problems Google does, except less volume and even more terrible advertiser tools/APIs).",1321211615

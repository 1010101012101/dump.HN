One of my personal heroes in the tech industry was a guy named Brad Silverberg.  He was #3 at Microsoft under only Gates and Ballmer and he took a year sabbatical to ride his bike of all things.<p>As far as ""there’s always a reason"" I have to ask: Have you looked at what the symptoms are for the disease he has?  Fatigue, Hair Loss, Urinary Tract Infection, etc...  I’d take a few months off if I were him.  It doesn’t mean he’s any sicker than he says he is.",1231984658

The question ""would she be better off as a person without me?"" has weighed heavily on my mind.  I've brought it up several times, and she says she does want to try to make it work.  I just hope she is acting true to herself, and always will.  The last thing I'd ever want is for her spirit to be diminished because of me.",1231983370

If you are living in the Bay Area (or are interested in traveling), I recommend coming to 360iDev!<p>http://360idev.eventbrite.com/<p>I've gone to one of their conferences before (for Adobe Flex), its going to be at eBay town hall in San Jose, CA.<p>Its a 3 day conference that focuses on:<p>- Game Development\n- Non-game Application Development\n- The Business of iPhone development\n- Hands-on Training<p>The event is only $200 bucks which is a steal for hackers on the cheap!! Not cheap enough? They just handed out a 10% discount code on Twitter: 'TwitterFriends113'.<p>I also noticed during checkout that they send you a complimentary copy of the Cluetrain Manifesto, pretty rad!<p>Just thought I'd let my fellow hackers know about this conference, they don't appear to do a lot of advertising.<p>Let me know if you are going, we can maybe do a HN meetup there?",1231982237

434673,comment,433866,433866,0,0,euroclydon,,,"I had a job with a small start-up. They advertised ""performance based bonuses"" when I was hired, so I figured I would make up for a not-so-hot salary with the bonus. We had a good first year. The owner even sent out an email thanking the four non-founders for our effort, and stating how many million dollars they made.<p>A few weeks went by after the email (Christmas was fast approaching), and I still hadn't received a performance review. Two days before Christmas, the owner walks into my office and mumbles something about a little extra in the check. Well, I got $400. I considered it a slap in the face, and found a new job.<p>A couple months later, right before I quit, the gave me a review, and a 4% raise, but it was too late.",1231982032

Nortel sucked in more people from my class than any other employer. Since they had to agree not to lay off students, interns were often the only ones to survive the early layoffs. There were people who watched their entire department fired several times over.<p>It made for some interesting stories, but not a lot of people who wanted to return after graduation.",1231981737

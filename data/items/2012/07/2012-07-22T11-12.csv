You can look at patents as a complicated tax system intended to fund innovation. We might be better off just making it an actual tax system that funds education.<p>It can also get solved by foundations, or by for-profit actors working in non-profit-seeking ways. Linux is a great example of innovation in that model. Industry consortia are an interesting model, as is something like Underwriters Laboratories.",1342958276

Germany has hardly any fully-funded PhD positions. Instead you typically get employed as staff and have to combine that with your PhD work. The problem is, often professors take on lots of PhD students to get more funding and end up having hardly any time. I've heard stories of a professor having 8 or so PhD students that still wait on him to read their thesis and give the go-ahead for their viva (PhD defense). I'm not saying this is the case everywhere, but it's something to be aware of. So try and find out beforehand.",1342958033

4277141,comment,4276916,4277119,2,0,etherael,,,"I believe emotion is useless because it is largely a distraction. By this I mean that if there are reasons other than emotional to take a course of action, the positive enforcement of emotion to push you in that direction is unnecessary. However, if there are no reasons other than emotional in order to undertake an action, that's a good indicator that the action is not a good path to take.<p>This doesn't mean that an action which we are compelled to undertake for emotional reasons is necessarily bad, merely that the emotional justification alone is not enough. Same with when we are compelled not to and negative emotions.<p>Emotion just serves to muddy the waters. I certainly agree with your position that it had an evolutionary advantage at one stage, however I think that has run its course. Frequently human society appears to be little more than an orgy of unthinking, emotionally charged activity. People think less and feel more, and they are guided by these emotions more than by their rational thoughts, to the extent that normal people even think at all.<p>I think that this is a bad thing. Look at our politics and advertisements, or more generally our levers of compulsion, what largely are the appeals in these arenas designed to target? Our emotions, because this is an extremely effective path for manipulation, the vast majority of humankind is enormously weak to this kind of thing. I believe there is value in making a conscious effort to reject this paradigm.",1342957911

4277135,comment,4276784,4276921,5,0,maayank,,,"I'd just like to add my experiences in Germany[1] as a techie:<p>- Almost no wifi. Coming from an area (outside of Germany) with abundant wifi at Cafes that came as a real shock to me.<p>- As the parent said, you can't rely on just English for the day to day life. For example, I had to resort to a translator for getting a cellular account and cellular internet going. Even at O2, T-Mobile and Vodafone (global brand names) there were no representatives with enough English proficiency to tell me what the different packages included. That was for regular (non prepaid) accounts.<p>For a prepaid sim card the situation was a little bit better (seller could understand English but not help me with cellular internet configuration, could explain it later to a German, so it wasn't because of lack of technical knowledge) but the automated phone service (that you need to use for selecting plans, add credit, etc.) was German only.<p>- The cellular reception at cities is good, but the cellular (and cellular internet) reception at the more rural areas (even 30 minutes away from the big cities) proved very sketchy to me.<p>Those are the problems that surprised me. There are definitely advantages (good public transport inside big cities, relatively cheap living on the east), but I have nothing to add to other posters on that front.<p>EDIT: another thing that surprised me is that internet tethering is disabled (with no other option) on prepaid sims and costs extra (if at all possible) for regular accounts, at least in all the venues I checked. Again, if you come from a country/carrier where it is like that you won't be surprised, but I was. Especially as I've known Germany as ""the place pioneering in unlocked phones"".<p>IMPORTANT EDIT2 about salaries: while cheaper, if you come to work as a local employee the salary as a programer might be lower.

This means that for management to give us 2 eggs, they were willing to spend 1 additional egg to let us make (in the worst-case) 14 trips vs 100 if we only had 1 egg.  So 1 egg < 86 trips in labor cost.<p>But they weren't willing to give us a 3rd egg.  This means that 1E is more than 5 trips.  So our labor cost is less than E0.20/trip (assuming a uniform labor cost per trip), but more than E0.012/trip (E1 / 86 trips).<p>My goal is to find someone willing to work for E1 for 100 trips.  This would be be between 1/20 and 86% of my salary (management's choice don't give me enough information to know exactly how much I will be making in eggs).<p>So if I can find someone* willing to work for that labor cost, I can give him the 1 egg problem, and I can give him the other egg to pay his salary, I then I can spend my time doing something more interesting while still achieving management's objectives.<p>*Assume the cost of finding an employee is zero.

4277119,comment,4276916,4277071,4,0,lusr,,,"Why do you believe emotion is useless?  I cannot think of any aspects of our psychology that are useless (they evolved for a reason).<p>Negative emotions are fundamentally indicators of a cognitive dissonance and are absolutely invaluable in maintaining a healthy system of introspection.  Your profile shows you're also a programmer so here's an analogy I use internally:  negative emotions are part of a monitoring system built into our brains that inform us when an assumption in our set of operating beliefs (our personality source code) has been violated.  (You get angry when your beliefs about 'fairness' are violated, you feel disappointment when your beliefs about e.g. 'relationships' are violated, etc.)<p>Positive emotions fulfil a similar role, in the opposite direction by reinforcing the value of the beliefs you've created, although negative emotions are more interesting because your response to the emotion can be extrospective (""I feel angry because that guy cut me off on the road and that violates my beliefs about fairness;  I'm getting out my tire iron and teaching him the <i>right</i> way to do things"") or they can be introspectively rational, controlled and empowering (""Should I revisit my beliefs about fairness to be more in tune with reality, where people make mistakes?"").  People with dysfunctional belief systems and rigid attitudes towards their beliefs are prone to depression (i.e. their belief systems do not serve them well given reality, either through distortion or inadapation).<p>From an evolutionary perspective, I suspect extrospective analysis was more useful (""I'm angry because the other ape has stolen my lunch, and resources are scarce, so I'm going to punch him in the face""), which explains our default, instinctive ""emotional"" response to emotions, but as civilization develops and the rules change, introspective responses (which encourage co-operation) are more useful (but more fraught with dangers such as depression, which is a kind of reinforcement feedback loop of negative emotional states, beliefs and poor assumptions).  Nevertheless, the high <i>value</i> of emotions remains present.<p>If anybody reading this finds this personal philosophy interesting, I highly recommend reading David Burns' ""Feeling Good"" for an exhaustive listing/discussion of emotional states and responses, and constructive ways of dealing with these experiences.",1342957027

Not a single student thinks that ""Hmm, I'll take German now, because I believe I may need it in the future!"". No. What they think is ""Hmm, I've always been a big fan of Rammstein and German language so I want to learn it"". I'd argue that only after people attend Universities and colleges at 18+, they really start thinking about their future and may actually plan their courses and classes based on what they'll (want to) do in the future.<p>Of course, when you think about this in the context of moving to Berlin after the rising startup scene, we're only interested in those who actually attend university, who care about their future, who study hard and so on.

After the war, the Allies demolished much of the industry -- Siemens, for instance, moved to Munich. With the division of he city, many people moved away, leaving postwar Berlin with a loss of almost a third of its population. Since then, the city hasn't recovered its peak population, leaving many empty houses and low rents. In addition, the economy in Berlin has always been, and still is, very weak, and unemployment is high. All this helps to keep the cost of living low (even if, Berlin having become capital and sort of a hip place, it's higher now than it was 15 years ago).",1342956551

When the wall was still standing, west Berlin wasn't the most desirable place to live in Western Germany, it being basically an island in the communist east. So while cities in the West grew wealthy with industry Berlin was always the special case, not exactly a place for major industry to take root. It also became a haven for artists, musicians, intellectuals, homosexuals, anarchists, and other people not willing to take part in the mandatory military service that was required when you lived in the West (Berlin residents were exempt).<p>Real estate-wise Berlin has (or at least <i>had</i> until recently) a surplus of vacancies: both apartments and commercial buildings. This is partly due to fluctuations in population throughout its history, and steep declines in manufacturing and population during the wall years from their pre-WW2 heights. There were also huge swaths of prime central real estate throughout the city where the wall once stood, that was unusable until it came down.<p>What you end up with is a city that was originally planned and built for more people than live there, with vacant factories, warehouses, and office buildings from yesteryear that are readily and cheaply repurposed.<p>Berlin's population is growing these days though, and internationals, people from other parts of Europe, and other parts of Germany are flocking to the city. This means rent prices are on the rise, and vacancy is dropping. It's still way cheaper than any other major European city for now.",1342956484

I believe that maybe notch should read up more on criteria of patentability, other patent areas, and the feasibility of having everything 'funded by government' and perhaps share some of that too.<p>I agree that something like a software patent may be a bad idea, but you have to realise that a lot of people read your stuff and get influenced by this 'half of the patent picture' and then leave with the wrong idea and start criticising legitimate patent areas.<p>For example: Company A spends $200M of investors money finding a new anti-depressant. Ok so they invested all of this money, now they need to spend 8 years proving to the FDA that it is safe to use, there goes another $300M. 'Generic pharmacies inc' says hey, thanks for doing all that work, now we can manufacture that drug in our factory for 1c/pill and make a little bit of money, good luck recouping your research money because we just got all the cheap sales. Company A goes bankrupt, the investors lose their money. Company B and C notice this industry is poor for research, and decide never to spend that money finding an anti brain-tumor agent.<p>However, if company A had patented their idea, then they will have around 10-15 years of patent-protected time (because they have to patent before divulging it, and by the time you get through trials and approval you can often have just a few years left) to sell their drug at a price where they can recoup their $500M, and invest in more bigger and better research. 
Meanwhile, whilst patented, other companies can see that research and build upon it with their own research - they just cant rip them off with the money they are owed in that time by selling it without permission. If they really want to sell it, they can ask the company to license it to them, and pay royalties. Later, the patent expires, as all of them do, and then generic company is free to manufacture it without paying the inventor a cent.<p>Is this not a valid reason for patents?

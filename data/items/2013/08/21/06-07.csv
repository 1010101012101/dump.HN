Because more usage means more revenue.<p>Mobile OS and hardware makers already care about battery life and efficiency, because these are strong competitive advantages.<p>The rest of the effort seems to be into getting carriers to make Facebook/other companies requests out of quota, witch is not new and belongs more to marketing/sales strategy than anything else.<p>This initiative feels like some generic PR move with nothing special to latch on.",1377068232

We haven&#x27;t had a real dust storm in Beijing since early 2008, I think, and definitely not one in the last 4 years.<p>The PM2.5 today is not carried by dust from the Gobi, but it still exists, of course. Ironically, the overall effect today is much worse than it was in 2008 (maybe because it just stays in Asia now?). I&#x27;m not sure if the pollution can still travel across the pacific without the huge dust storms of the past.<p>Here is some more info:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Dust"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Dust</a><p>All of the info in the article is out of date though.

We spend far too much of our time being grossly <i>overstimulated</i>, and I&#x27;ve found that a great many of the typical stimulations in a Western experience (advertising, technology, popular music, city streets, etc.) simply <i>wear</i> at me.  Nature, nonlinear landscapes, classical (or earlier) Western music (there is some awfully annoying non-western music, Indonesian gamelan being very high on the annoyance list for me) help immensely in this regard.<p>Just as strength training is stimulus for growth that comes during recovery, I suspect music may be part of the downtime which helps the brain and/or emotional / stress aspects of the body recover.

The main two vim emulators that I am using are:<p>- XVim for XCode<p>- Evil for Emacs<p>And both do a really good job. Evil beats XVim hands down, but XVim is a lot better than the others I tried: IdeaVim (for Intellij), Vrapper (Vim for Eclipse), and Vintage (Vim for Sublime). Out of these, vintage is by far the worst. I think it does more harm than good because the missing and wrongly implemented keys confuse me so much that I get worse at vimming. IdeaVim lacked a lot of the keys that I use regularly important (vi&quot;, va&quot;, vit, vat, etc), and Vrapper was kinda good but I think I couldn&#x27;t map jj to <ESC>, but it&#x27;s been some time since I had to use Eclipse.<p>I tried to fix IdeaVim, but I browsed the source for some time and couldn&#x27;t really figure out what to do. However, I also enhanced my local XVim and Evil setups a bit by extending the code and it was a lot easier than with IdeaVim.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before, but with all these implementations, somebody should have written a &quot;libVim&quot; in lua, that can be embedded in almost any project, and can be hooked into the input stream, and then you&#x27;d just need to define a set of methods in your delegate textfield (or what it is) and the libVim will call these methods based on input (i.e. move cursor, insert text at position, change text at position, scroll up, scroll down). I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d need that many delegate methods since mostly it is writing to a text buffer.",1377068025

It&#x27;s the same argument about treacherous computing that goes around, except the article seems to be suggesting people think it&#x27;s a extent problem now because the TPM is always on, not a hypothetical in the future/ Microsoft&#x27;s long term plan. Further, there is a nebulous assertion linking this to the NSA.<p>1) The TPM still can&#x27;t control your computer(yet). It can only measure it&#x27;s state, allow you access to keys you created in some state, and attest to things about the state (which would allow other parties to mandate what state your system is in when interacting with it, but presumably those entities would be bond by German law and likely be German themselves)<p>2) If Microsoft wanted to backdoor your system, they don&#x27;t need the TPM to do it. In fact, the TPM can be used to protect against a whole bunch of malware that various intelligence agencies might use: it can protect keys with passwords (with rate limiting/self destruct for guessing), make sure the system is in the same state(i.e. malware free) when you created you PGP key as it is when your using it to decrypt an e-mail, and it can isolate an application from the rest of your system.",1377067492

6248557,comment,6241985,6241985,3,0,risoldi,,,"First, I see friendship is an intimate relationship that is not marred by sexual connotations or the sense obligation coming from family ties. It is the purest form of relationship, as it is fully based on choice. Personally I get a peculiar mix of sense of freedom and love from friendships.\nBuilding a friendship, I think, comes not only from emotional kinship, but from the regular sharing of experience. One does not go without the other: sharing without kinship makes acquaintances you spend evenings with, not friends. Kinship alone on the other hand is hardly even realized if there is no sharing. In some ways, all the people I consider friends have shared some experience (a bad one sometimes) with me.\nHowever, your question comes from a specific place, which is how friendships that are built survive long periods of separation.\nSome friendships (typically a handful in a life) will survive long separations. It&#x27;s those persons that will always feel familiar no matter how much time passed since the last time you spoke to them. You will both understand the meaning of each other&#x27;s words. It&#x27;s those friends that you feel a bit guilty about for not calling them for so long, but then when you speak to them you realize they&#x27;re still them, and you are still you. Those friends who always soften your heart a bit when you think about them. Finding such a friend is almost always a surprise, as you don&#x27;t go looking for them the way you go looking for a relationship with a lady because of her fine back bottom. These kind of connections are less evident, and often hidden. \nWhat happens when time and distance makes people grow apart? It can happen, people live, make new experiences and change all the time. I think friendships are a particularly healthy element in life. A friend remembers you for what you were and in a way reminds you of what you were as well. When you speak to your friends, you can shed masks and be brought back to your inner self. Is it possible to change so much that you cannot find that kinship that used to be? Of course. As all things of this world, relationship are subject to fading. Can one avoid it? Maybe. I think that if life makes you grow in such a way that some friendships cannot survive, there&#x27;s not much one can do. There&#x27;s a romantic side to this, as when you realize the love of your life has become distant. At the end of a life, I think, one is lucky enough if he or she has known friendship. Just like love. But without all the arguing about who left the toothpaste cap off. :oP\nThese are the thought of a 36-yo who has been away from his country for the last 11 years who has most of his best friends scattered all around.",1377067136

We are starting to have some stuff that could be done remotely, but it is very hard to get someone remote up to speed on the vocabulary of the product.<p>We build things like Search Engines.  Which have a Crawler, an indexer, a few dozen scorers, the front end, the Natural Language processor, the content extractor....<p>And all of those things have to talk to each other and be set up to run on your personal dev environment.

6455470,comment,6455269,6455383,50,0,SwellJoe,,,"I remember the post that launched imgur.<p>It really was a scratch your own itch kind of thing. So many redditors complained about the crappy image sharing sites...lots of them were verboten to use on reddit because they were so spammy, or slow, or whatever. There was no clear leader in the image sharing space. Facebook was impossible (because it wants to own every user and won&#x27;t let you show someone something without logging in), even if it were an acceptable place to upload weird random pictures (I know many people who do, but they just don&#x27;t know about reddit and imgur yet). So...imgur&#x27;s founder saw a very clear need, and humbly pointed redditors to it.<p>It took off because it was amazing in its simplicity and sincerity. imgur&#x27;s founder <i>clearly</i> wanted you to share funny pictures in imgur, even if he couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make it pay him money for every image. He just wanted to solve a very real problem that caused millions of people tiny amounts of pain. (When picking a problem, pick one that causes either a few people a <i>lot</i> of pain, or one that causes a <i>lot</i> of people a little bit of pain. You&#x27;re unlikely to find a problem that causes a <i>lot</i> of people a <i>lot</i> of pain, since those are already usually very competitive.)",1380261569

Didn&#x27;t the VCs have to do the due diligence?<p>I didn&#x27;t have any direct experience with JustFab. The victim was my girlfriend. Back in January 2012, one of her friends emailed her a link to JustFab, then she bought a pair of shoes from www.justfab.com and never visit the website again. Then 8 months later, in September 2013 she finished her Master study in the US and returned to her home country. She was appalled to find out that her credit card has been charged a $39.95 fee for the last eight months. Yes, $39.95 for 8 months, without getting anything from JustFab.<p>I then did a bit research on the internet. It turned out my girlfriend wasn&#x27;t the only victim. Apparently JustFab works like this: once you buy something from their website, you become their &quot;VIP member&quot; without your knowledge. Then you will have to log into their website between the 1st-5th of each month and click Skip This Month. If no action is taken (either skip this month, or cancel your account), they just charge you a $39.95 fee every month.<p>According to article published on BusinessInsider, JustFab &quot;generate about $100 million this year&quot; in sales, I wonder how much of this $100 million are from people like my girlfriend who simply didn&#x27;t read their entire 2,500 words Terms of Service and were unaware that they were charged $39.95 a month for nothing.<p>[1] http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/26/justfab-sews-up-40m-to-become-global-fast-fashion-empire/<p>[2] http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/26/justfab-has-raised-another-40m-led-by-hong-kongs-shining-capital-to-take-its-fashion-subscription-commerce-model-to-asia/<p>ps.

To my knowledge, this is not true -- especially for Earth missions, I think all that data is public.  Perhaps the level 0 data [essentially, raw telemetry] is not, but everything from level 1 up will be public.<p>The data-release culture is very discipline specific.  In planetary (e.g. Mars), there are embargo periods -- partly to ensure the systematics are understood.  In cosmology, a four-year embargo period for Planck was ended just this summer.  This kind of makes sense -- they didn&#x27;t want half the astrophysicists in the world off chasing a phantom caused by their very sensitive noise-suppression tools.  But I understand the community was getting pretty impatient.  So, there is push-back.<p>For Earth missions, after an initial calibration period, I think all the data is made public as fast as it can be processed.  Indeed, MODIS even broadcasts the raw data to whomever wants to pick it up (<a href=""http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/directbrod/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/directbrod/</a>), like disaster responders.<p>Like I said, it&#x27;s discipline-specific.  For disciplines where time matters (Earth, space weather, seismicity/geodesy, time-domain astronomy) there is a real advantage in releasing data fast, and that&#x27;s what has happened.

This can be demonstrated in a laboratory, and we even know why this is the case, thanks to quantum physics.<p>2) When sunlight hits the Earth, some is absorbed, and then re-emitted red-shifted.  Again, we have direct satellite measurements of this, and we also have the theoretical explanation as to why, thanks you again quantum physics.<p>3) We know that we are increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Again, direct measurements show this, plus we know that we are producing CO2 with our industrial processes.<p>Put those 3 facts together, and the baseline conclusion is that unless there is some unknown fourth factor, our planet is going to get hotter.  Scientists noticed this back in the sixties, and started conducting experiments to see if this was indeed the case.  All of our measurements since then show that global temperature is increasing, on average, which ties in nicely with what we expect from theory (points 1-3 above).<p>Anybody that wants to make a serious claim that climate change isn&#x27;t happening needs to either demonstrate that one of points 1-3 is wrong, or that there is a fourth factor.  A fourth factor would be something like &quot;as the world&#x27;s oceans become more acidic due to absorption of CO2, past a certain threshold value the surface becomes more mirror-like, increasing the albedo, and hence reducing the amount of red-shifting of light&quot;.  A paper that demonstrated this, and demonstrated that the effect would be big enough to overcome the increased absorption caused by increased CO2 would indeed have demonstrated that climate change would indeed be limited by the threshold value.  If such a paper were to come out, I personally would probably breath a deep sigh of relief and then throw a party.<p>If someone tries to claim that climate change isn&#x27;t happening without demonstrating that points 1,2 or 3 are wrong, and without demonstrating an unknown factor that hadn&#x27;t yet been taken into account can be safely dismissed.  You <i>can</i> question the specifics of the models, like &quot;is the Greenland ice sheet going to melt in 10 years? 100 years? 1000 years?&quot;  That&#x27;s fair game, and if you go and read the papers, you will see scientists doing just that.  But the overarching question of climate change? That&#x27;s settled business already, and anyone claiming otherwise deserves the title of &quot;denialist&quot;.",1380258334

I lived in Yunnan for 5 years and really fell in love with the place, which is surrounded by Tibet, Burma, Laos and Vietnam and is China&#x27;s most biologically, climatically, culturally, historically and linguistically diverse province. Despite a near total lack of credentials, I&#x27;m currently writing a long form history of Yunnan for a general audience from prehistory through near-present in English, as a fun long term side project. I&#x27;m also an Australian. Australians have been involved in many other studies in the area, such as historical water level studies of the region&#x27;s impressively large alpine lakes. Kew Gardens in London also collaborate with the province on a shared long term global seed bank project.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Deer_Cave_people"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Deer_Cave_people</a>",1380258312

</code></pre>
Now you can see that x isn&#x27;t actually an int but a reference to one.<p>As for automatically derived traits, those are actually slightly more powerful macros implemented in the compiler itself. You can see it at rust/src/libsyntax/ext/*.<p>For default methods, you just put the code you want in the trait itself. Like so:<p><pre><code>    trait Animal {
        fn sound(&self) -> ~str;
        fn make_sound(&self) {
            println(self.sound());
        }
    }
</code></pre>
The make_sound method is what&#x27;s called a default method. If you implemented that trait, at the very least you would have to define the sound method and if you wanted to, you could override the default make_sound method.<p>Macros are actually created with another macro called macro_rules.

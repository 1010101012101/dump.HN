It is small payments that would usually need cash like a sandwich or magazine.  These are also the kind of shops where loyalty schemes can be important.  Think of the small coffee shop handing out &quot;fifth cup of coffee free&quot; cards.  Think how easy it would be for apple to roll out loyalty schemes or promotions and absorb the cost into the transaction fee.",1410613174

This similarly sounds impossible. Maybe there&#x27;s some extra constraints they don&#x27;t mention - just supermarkets, or just consumer spending. I know I certainly don&#x27;t spend anything like £1 out of every £7 in Tesco, or any other supermarket. For example I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve spent many times more on buying my house than I will in Tesco in my entire life.<p>This is the sort of thing that More or Less should look at <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qshd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qshd</a>.",1410610426

Darwin at work... For similar reasons, I&#x27;m not pro-drugs.<p>But I don&#x27;t think a ban on cantaloupe is needed, the same way I think drug prohibition is not an appropriate response to drug abuse. I know it seems far stretched, but please read on.<p>We base our choice on perceived risk vs benefits. \nPeople who decide to use drugs that could kill them probably don&#x27;t care about the law. If you accept a high risk of death, jail shouldn&#x27;t look like a major risk for you.<p>The fact that a majority of people have tried drugs prove that prohibition only allows punishment, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent drug abuse.<p>Reconsidering prohibition doesn&#x27;t equal being lawless: if a drug addict kills/hurts/steals from you, he risks jail anyway for that (not so much for using drugs!). Prohibition doesn&#x27;t protect us.<p>Reconsidering prohibition might open the society for more evolution. Research could lead to real health benefits under medical supervision. Maybe a startup could find ways to explore the effects of some drug safely. Maybe the society would start teaching people about psychology and altered states of mind... Maybe drug traffics would plummet, leading to less violence. Maybe we could then treat all addictions, without a legal vs illegal barrier which is probably barring some from seeking help. And I believe I&#x27;m not creative/clever enough to imagine all those changes that would occur.<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s widely accepted on HN that we must measure the effects of the actions we take. Reconsidering prohibition will allow such measurement and we&#x27;ll build our future more wisely.<p>There will still be casualties, but think again about that cantaloupe... You can&#x27;t ban cantaloupe to save me from myself.",1410610354

How popular this is I have no idea, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if people who willingly hand over their transaction history to Google would also think its rational to use a google supplied card instead of their own card sitting right next to it in their wallet.<p>However, it&#x27;s also not quite the wild-west of implementations that you imagine.<p>All the major credit card systems for contactless payments, are an implementation of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_14443"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_14443</a> - of which NFC is also a compatible implementation.<p>Australia (and I suspect Europe) has had Visa PayWave/MC PayPass for a number of years - PayWave/PayPass POS terminals are very common in shops.<p>That the POS systems are not common in the US right now is no different to GSM not being common in the US when the iPhone was launched. America just seems to be particularly bad at implementing broad community affecting changes - and extremely bad at anything to do with banks it seems - like this, until they&#x27;re dragged kicking and screaming into it.<p>I suspect that once Apple starts organising the B2B arrangements (i.e. dealing with banks) the rollout of ApplePay in the rest of the world - particularly &quot;1st world&quot; countries - will be phenomenally quick compared to in the US.",1410610036

When I was in high school I built a foundry (basically a stack of bricks with a draft hole and a place to put a small cast iron pot). I used it to melt aluminum and make castings in sand, and it was tons of fun. Looking back, I had no concept of safety at all but amazingly I didn&#x27;t burn down our chicken coop, which is where it was built. The fuel I used to melt the aluminum was leftover lumber from our house remodel that I cut into cubes, and I had an old double squirrel cage blower set up to provide the draft.<p>1. backyardmetalcasting.com",1410610003

8312164,comment,8309490,8312138,2,0,loup-vaillant,,,"1. Okay, then, let&#x27;s do a study about <i>how much time</i> does independent invention need.  Then patent durations must be tuned to that.  For instance, if most independent re-inventions takes 2 years, then we shouldn&#x27;t grant patents for more than 3 of 4 years.  I suspect that according to this criterion, current durations are much, much too high.<p>2. I just take for granted that all other things being equal, having a monopoly is much worse than not having it: the (diffuse) cost to society at large is much higher than the (concentrated, visible) benefit to the monopolist.<p>I take it for granted that it is not defensible to have the society pay a significant cost just to reward a lone entity, no matter how much he &quot;deserves a reward&quot;.  Global costs must be balanced by global benefits.  The very existence of an invention is such a global benefit.  But unless the patent helped get the invention out sooner, that benefit is void, and the patent, unjustified.<p>Also, apparently, we haven&#x27;t read the same &quot;tons of studies&quot;.  The arguments againts patents I have read so far (<i>Against Intellectual Monopoly</i> was a good read), sounded very compelling —not to mention grounded in evidence.  Could you give me some pointers to the studies you speak of?",1410609817

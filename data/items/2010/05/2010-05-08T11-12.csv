It turned into procrastinating somewhere between my first college assignment and my last internal assessment. I am just unable to complete my studies or anything I uninteresting in the short run. I have been working upon it (diagnosis, as they say, is the first step of curing), but with no luck. Now the problem is, I have finals on 20th and have done very less studies till date. Everytime I want to just get down and study my mind seems to have a knee jerk reaction and I find something else to do.<p>Have you ever coped up with such a situation? Please give your suggestions on how you solved it.",1273319613

Rather, I'd say the site needs less churn - top articles should stay on the front page for at least a day. That just means a different ranking, maybe something like log(votes)*weight, where weight decays over time but gets bumped at each upvote.<p>If that's not enough churn for some people, I'd prefer a filter that lets them temporarily hide some stories. And ten there's /newest<p>I know there's also the /best section, but it's not linked to and I don't know how it's ranked.<p>A reddit-like url filter would help a little in catching reposts, but I'm not sure this is a big problem yet.",1273319444

Even if lose some of our surface fleet or some areas become no-go zones, those unequaled boats should still be able to do a <i>lot</i> of damage and most likely be able to prevent an adversary from gaining the command of the seas (at least regionally).<p>And finally his dismissal of CVNs for the current types of wars we're fighting is not credible.  The utility of a floating airbase that can be off shore within a short period of time is pretty immense.  No messing with getting approval from foreign nations for basing, no slow startup getting a remote base set up, more manageable security, etc.  Supercarriers have proven their worth in a lot of small ""dirty"" wars and incidents.<p>In terms of soft power they're great for natural disasters.

Crude oil is crude oil is crude oil.</i><p>Well that’s what everyone thought up until the 1970’s, when America’s oil fields went into rapid decline.  Here’s how it went down:<p>US> Hello, Saudi Arabia?  We would like oil.<p>SAUDI> No.<p>US> That's ok!  As Jacko says, oil is fungible!  Hello, UAE?  Oil please.<p>UAE> No.<p>US> That's ok!  As Jacko says, oil is fungible!  Hello, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait?<p>> No.<p>US> Fungible!  It's fungible!  Hello, Libya, Qatar, Algeria, Syria, Tunisia?<p>> No.<p>And suddenly, there was oil panic.  Because while oil is fungible, that's an attribute of market dynamics. You have 18 suppliers?  Great.  Oil is fungible.  If one won't sell there are 17 more.  But what happens if all 18 won't sell?<p>Without oil, some countries, like America and its military, can't function.  That makes it also strategic.<p>According your logic, the 1973 crisis wouldn't have happened.  Yet it did.  And it could again.  Oil is fungible until it's strategic.  End of sentence.",1273318242

Questionify is at the early stage and I'm following the lean startup principle, so I'm looking for the initial customers.<p>How is Questionify different from GetSatisfaction/Tenderapp/Uservoice? 
Questionify is a Q&A platform that lets your customers ask questions. Your employees answer them through the web interface or by email(you get an email every time someone asks a question) and your support page is updated in a matter of seconds. You can upload screenshots or paste YouTube URLs in answers, we'll convert them and prettify the answers.<p>Fully brandable. Questionify is full brandable, you can style it by uploading your company's logo, setting the brand colors.<p>No registration necessary for posting a question. Your customers dont have to register on Questionify to post a question, questions are monitored through the Pending Questions tab.<p>Subscribe to a question. On every question page, customers can subscribe to a question(by leaving their email) and get notified when that question is answered or if the current answer is changed. Customers can leave their email when creating a question and they're automatically added to the question's subscriber list.<p>Questions are sorted by category and views. Every question belongs to a category which you can create/edit/update/delete, questions belong to categories. For instance, if Hacker News was using Questionify, some categories would be: issues, submitting a post, jobs, etc. Every time you open up a question it's rank is increased by one(backend: questions have a views field which is auto incremented by 1 upon every question view) so that your home page shows the 10 most viewed questions for each category.<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts, opionions, questions.

SQLAlchemy did. ;-) (<a href=""http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlalchemy.org/</a>)<p>You mean simply using normal CS data structures and keeping application data in memory?  That approach certainly works - PG uses it for this site, and I believe it's used for Mailinator and Bloglines.<p>But you should think of the services that a database gives you and consider whether you're going to use them.  That includes:<p>1.) Indexing by arbitrary column<p>2.) Subranges & slices, again by arbitrary column<p>3.) Joins<p>4.) Sorting<p>5.) Quick summarizing, over any combination of columns<p>6.) Transactions<p>7.) Persistence<p>8.) Concurrency control<p>9.) Access from multiple languages<p>10.) Distribution<p>If you aren't going to use any of these, then by all means Keep It Simple.  If you're only going to use one or two - say you need persistence, indexing, and slicing - you can probably roll something up with your language's normal libraries.  But if it looks like you'll need a good chunk of them, you'll drive yourself nuts trying to implement them yourself.  Even maintaining multiple indexes via your hashtable approach can get very complicated when you have multiple requests inserting, deleting, and changing rows.",1190824881

MySQL has them. ;-)<p>You're still missing out on a lot of functionality (even besides transactions/persistence/concurrency).

59850,comment,59794,59842,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Could be.<p>I'm reminded of the two competing camps for large-scale systems design.  The UNIX philosophy is ""small pieces loosely joined"": each component does one thing well, and the system just provides a common metaphor and architecture for them to work together (eg. pipes and line-oriented text).  The Windows philosophy is ""big chunks tightly coupled"": everything just works out of the box, but if you need to do something the designers didn't think of, you're out of luck.  Kinda like ""I'll do it myself; show me how"" vs. ""Do it for me.""<p>Nearly every computing system can be placed somewhere along this continuum.  In operating systems, we've got MacOS (pre-X) and Windows on one side and UNIX on the other.  In languages, we've got Scheme and Smalltalk on the UNIX side and Java and .NET on the other (ironically, Scheme and Smalltalk have a ""small pieces loosely coupled"" architecture internally, but are big monolithic chunks when it comes to the outside world).  For IDEs, Emacs is all the way over on the UNIX side, vim not far behind, Eclipse is in the middle, and IntelliJ and Visual Studio all the way on the Windows side.  For JavaScript libraries, YUI/Mootools/Prototype are all on the Windows side and JQuery is on the UNIX side, though it's moving closer to the Windows philosophy.  Among web frameworks, Rails and Django are on the Windows side with Pylons on the UNIX side.  The web itself is based on the UNIX philosophy, but many of the largest websites follow the Windows philosophy.<p>I'm not so certain that people fit rigidly into one category though.  Up until about 3-4 years ago, I was firmly in the Windows camp: I did Java programming only, I did it on a Windows machine, I used JBuilder and Eclipse to do it.  Then I started branching out, mostly because I started learning about all this stuff that Java wouldn't let me get at.  I think many people may follow a similar path: ""do it for me"" until you want to do something that the designers didn't think of, and then you have no choice to move to a ""do it yourself; we'll show you how"" environment.",1190823772

The primary key is my primary hash, other keys are just extra hash maps pointing to the main array.<p>I understand, perhaps none of the existing languages can fully replace the DB functionality, but I suspect nobody is even thinking about that because - hey, there are plenty of nice DBMSs around, why bother reinventing them?<p><i>but then what you have isn't a simple array any more</i><p>True, but again, it's a matter of having an infrastructure that handles sharing for you.

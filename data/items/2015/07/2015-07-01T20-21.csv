An 80k to 100k raise would be literally impossible because even if you ate up the entire pot by yourself, it still wouldn&#x27;t be enough.<p>On top of this, the more senior developers are probably consistently given slightly larger raises than the previous year - giving you more would require them to get less, which poses a large risk for your manager. It&#x27;s a tough situation to be in.<p>By giving your two week notice, managers are immediately given room to negotiate with HR to produce a counter offer. This does not count towards the yearly raise-pool and can sometimes be the only way to actually get a sizable raise.<p>My suggestion to the parent poster is to dust off the resume and start looking for another job if you feel unappreciated.",1435784353

I would wager that less than 90% of the players even are LFR geared, but assume a casual player with a mix of LFR gear, crafted, legendary, heroic BoEs is probably sitting around ilvl 663.

[1]<p>These numbers aren&#x27;t going to be a perfect comparison because of fight length, strategy changes when you overgear content, skill differentials, etc but gear is pretty important.<p>One could easily argue that having the highest end gear does not really serve a purpose if you aren&#x27;t doing any actual raiding or PvP though.<p>edit: I should probably mention that the last expansion (released last November) did a massive stat squish.

Player power was increasing so much they had to start working around not being able to increase raid boss HP higher than 2^31 - 1. 25 man heroic Thok had ~2b HP for example.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/7#bracket=2&difficulty=4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/7#bracket=2&difficulty...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/7#bracket=7&difficulty=4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/7#bracket=7&difficulty...</a>",1435784252

The Greek government of this time has made some severe errors. But I see an even bigger share in the EU (also German) politicians of that time (before the Euro was installed). It is a fact, that those politicians sold the Euro to the German population (I guess to others the same way) with the argument, that no country will ever have to pay for an other Euro country. They said, that there are so many security measures installed ...<p>But the weakest spot in those &quot;security measures&quot; where the politicians themselves. They <i>wanted</i> Greece to be inside the Euro, so they turned a blind eye to any warning signs. Of course they also turned a blind eye to every other country, because according to the &quot;security measures&quot; that where announced, nearly no country would have got the Euro ... (even Germany violated the terms)<p>So, I see the biggest failure in the politicians, that just wanted to have this adventure -- without really managing the risks ....<p>It is really an ugly business, and we will see, where all this disaster (the Euro) leads us to. In now 5 years of so-called crisis-management, they even did not manage to &quot;rescue&quot; Greece ... (they just prolonged the pain) and other countries can still become in trouble soon.

Syntax highlighting was available throughout the entire file immediately after opening.<p>As an additional test, I tried doing a select all, cut and paste of the entire 3.5 MB source. The paste took 6 seconds. The editor interface was unresponsive during the entire time. Syntax highlighting became available immediately after the paste completed.<p>VS Code results:<p>File opened in 7 seconds. The interface was fully responsive for the entirety of this duration. Syntax highlighting took an additional split second, but this did not affect responsiveness either.<p>Cut and paste completed almost immediately, but syntax highlighting did not become available for another 7 seconds, but responsiveness is once again completely unaffected during the entire process.<p>So it looks like in terms of pure syntax highlighting speed, the two are rather evenly matched. However, it would appear that VS Code has an edge over Sublime 3 in both initial loading speed as well as in terms of UI responsiveness.<p>As for your question:<p>> So, remind me again why it&#x27;s an advantage to use a browser engine for this application?<p>My own answer would be that it&#x27;s simply the most accessible way to build cross platform applications. The web platform simply has had more optimizations and standardization work put into it than any other interface technology out there today.<p>It also happens to have a very simple model for concurrency that is very well suited for event-based UIs: the single UI thread with message passing through web workers. While it&#x27;s true that the traditional, free-for-all multi-threading based concurrency model is more <i>powerful</i>, it also presents a much heavier cognitive load on the developer and is notoriously error prone to implement.<p>It was probably a much simpler task to implement Web Workers in VS Code than it would have been to architect Sublime 3 into a fully multi-threaded application on all the platforms that it must support, in order to have the UI be fully responsive during intensive tasks like in VS Code.",1435784100

Since corporations ostensibly pay taxes, their personhood has been lifted. Likewise, since wealthy individuals tend to pay more taxes on an absolute basis (despite an increasingly regressive system) their interests within the constituency of taxpayers are also lifted.<p>[1]: The case for &quot;taxpayers&quot; has been assisted by the language of &quot;victim&#x27;s rights&quot; wherein people first accepted the idea that some citizens should have higher status before the law than others. Using the idea that paying taxes is a form of theft, taxpayers establish their victimhood and by an extension a privileged interest over ordinary citizens in matters concerning taxation. The obverse of the coin is &quot;consumer rights&quot; wherein buying &quot;Little Plastic Shit&quot; is seen as a high form of social engagement and the primary civic duty of ordinary Americans.",1435783907

At the more reductionist level, I&#x27;ve seen it best described as a &quot;donor riot&quot;; rather obviously the interests of the wealthy who identify as Republican are different that the base (and this is one reason why the Emmanuel Goldsteining of the <i>libertarian</i> Koch brothers strikes us as bizarre, then again they&#x27;ve got some truly dangerous thoughts).<p>At a more general level, these &quot;establishment&quot; Republicans are, or aspire to be, members of the ruling class.  We of the base obviously aren&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t think many of us aspire to be.<p>&quot;Offend&quot; is a good word, we are mightily offended by all this.  But there&#x27;s only so much we can do short of, say, starting a 3rd party that&#x27;s successful enough to either  threaten the Republican party such that it adopts our positions, or replace it like it replaced the Whigs (or there&#x27;s a thesis that the Democratic party will die since its war on arithmetic means it will eventually fail to keep its promises, the Republican party will replace it as the party of the state, and the 3rd party becomes the natural opposition).  Short of that, we can withdraw our votes, which has a strictly limited effect in the Congress, and we can and have withheld our money, which gets us back to that donor riot.<p>Ah, I should note there&#x27;s always been a non-conservative faction in the Republican party.  Its abolitionist roots were in opposition to the conservative nature of the Whigs, remember the trusting busting and imperialism of Teddy Roosevelt,  and the north-east wing in general is much less conservative.  Think of Nelson Rockefeller who opposed conservative Goldwater, not so conservative Nixon, and was Ford&#x27;s first VP.

9815023,comment,9814751,9814751,0,0,sparkie,,,"I switched due to RSI with the hope it would help - but the difference it made was neglible. Buying a better ergonomic keyboard is far more important than the key layout for coping with RSI. If you&#x27;re having problems, look for a column staggered keyboard with thumb modifiers.<p>Typing speed is not really any different from qwerty. Having all the vowels adjacent is sometimes a slowdown because you&#x27;re utilizing one hand more than the other. I&#x27;d probably look at Workman or one of the Q?MLW? layouts if I were to learn again - since they&#x27;re based on more modern attempts to measurably optimise the layout. The problem with those though, is having them supported by the OS and applications.<p>Which is perhaps the biggest reason not to bother with Dvorak. It&#x27;s a PITA to configure most operating systems and the apps you use to have consistent keyboard shortcuts/chords/sequences etc, without having to stretch your hands around the keyboard for operations like cut/copy/paste - which are probably already hard-wired into your neural network. You&#x27;ll find yourself reconfiguring the controls for any game you play - reconfiguring application&#x27;s keybindings, if they let you do so easily - and every one of them will have a different means of configuring them anyway.<p>As for switching between Dvorak and Qwerty, I&#x27;ve never had an issue doing it. I sometimes make a mistake for perhaps the first minute after the context switch, but I can easily type in either layout as good as ever. Perhaps because I still used Qwerty regularly while learning Dvorak and still use it frequently still (can&#x27;t change keyboard on work computers because people complain, etc).<p>For the time investment it&#x27;ll take to learn Dvorak, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not worth it. Start by getting a better keyboard (or for pleasure, make your own and adapt it to your hand shape). Play around with some other layouts like Workman and see if they feel comfortable. It should take only a few hours to learn any one layout and you&#x27;ll forget it pretty quickly if you don&#x27;t carry it on - so it&#x27;s not really an issue trying out several layouts to see what you like - then committing to one with spaced repetition or just hard grinding.",1435783596

I meant that they switched from GOAL to Racket for the PS3.<p>Here&#x27;s a summary from a presentation at the CUFP workshop (likely a shorter version of the slides above):<p><pre><code>  Dan Liebgold from Naughty Dog Software in Santa Monica then came on stage with the
  ﬁrst gaming related talk at CUFP. They produce the popular Uncharted game series for the
  Playstation, which is famous for its complex and interactive scripted scenes. Dan described
  modern game development as a major production effort where, roughly, artists produce
  data and programmers produce code.
  Naughty Dog has a history of using various Lisp dialects to handle the code and data in
  a uniﬁed way. But when making the jump from the Playstation 2 to the Playstation 3, they
  decided that maintaining a custom Lisp-based game development system was too costly,
  and instead dedicated their efforts to rebuilding the tools, engine, and game in C++ and
  assembly language.
  This decision left no scripting system for gameplay and, more importantly, no system
  for creating DSLs and the extensive glue data that is typically required to develop a major
  video game. There was no off-the-shelf scripting system that ﬁt the stringent memory
  requirements in a Playstation 3, and no language that would allow rapid DSL creation
  that ﬁt into the existing tool chain.
  With a bit of naivety, a penchant for the Scheme language, and a passion for functional
  programming techniques, the team dove in and put together a system to ﬁll in the gaps!
  They used mzScheme, which can compile to fast native code. Dan reported that the results
  have been very good, but not without issues. In particular, garbage collector performance
  sometime led to manual tuning being required, and build environment integration was
  tricky. Syntax transformations and error reporting led to confusion with new programmers
  too.
  On the other hand, the functional nature of the system was a big win, as it allowed
  them to ﬂexibly distill game data down to just the right form to embed into the resource-
  constrained run-time environment. The ﬁnal result is a system where programmers, artists,
  animators, and designers are productively programming directly in an S-expression Scheme-
  like language. Dan closed his talk by wowing the audience with the trailer for the game,
  which has now been released and is garnering extremely positive reviews.

Neoconservatives have for decades been obsessed with the Middle East. This is mostly because of its strategic importance as the source of oil.<p>There presents itself now an opportunity to change this strategic focus because of two trends. 1) Domestic oil production is up; so is fuel efficiency; so is the development of alternate energy. 2) Korea, China, Vietnam, and other Asian nations have growing economies and strategic ambitions. In the future of the U.S., oil will be less important; Asian trade relationships will be more important.<p>Thus Obama&#x27;s &quot;pivot to Asia.&quot; It has been mocked by Republicans, given the ongoing problems in both Russia and Iraq/Syria (both long-standing Republican policy bad guys). But really, something as big as the U.S. does not turn easily or fast.<p>TPP is a major component in that turn. It will create or enhance special relationships with a variety of Asian nations. It will firm up relationships that are currently being challenged by China, which has the biggest ambitions of anyone these days.<p>The details of the policy chapters are almost unimportant; they just need to be balanced well enough among all the parties, so that everyone gains slightly more than they lose. Trade agreements are, almost by definition, not optimal for any given single interest group or stakeholder.<p>In terms of IP specifically, it&#x27;s worth considering that the U.S. is far more dependent on IP than other nations. If you think about our most successful companies, many of them make nothing <i>but</i> IP: Apple, Google, Microsoft, TV shows, movies, recorded music, software, pharamceuticals, etc. So U.S. negotiators are going to try for max protection on those things.

9814966,comment,9804697,9812118,0,0,msandford,,,"> You&#x27;re side-stepping my main point: when a country defaults, you don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; to screw over its inhabitants just because you want to squeeze a little more money out. You can try, but it&#x27;s not &quot;right&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t believe I did side-step it, so let me try a little harder.<p>When it comes to the affairs between two countries, there are probably a bunch of things that are morally right and wrong.  And there are other things which the countries agree to do or not do by treaty, convention, and the like.<p>But just because a thing is immoral or against convention or what have you, that in no way precludes a country from doing it.  Similarly, just because a country is supposed to do a thing as per a convention or because of entirely upright moral reasons, again, nothing forces them to.<p>So while I agree with you that nothing really gives a country the &quot;right&quot; to do anything, that has little to no bearing on what countries ACTUALLY DO.<p>Which is why I continue to insist that what SHOULD happen and what WILL happen may have no bearing on one another at all.<p>Further, in order to have a &quot;legal framework&quot; in the affairs between two countries, you have to have a superseding authority.  Which doesn&#x27;t exist.  So the idea that any kind of legal framework does exist which governs their affairs is a fiction.  There are some institutions which have the appearance of a superseding authority like the EU or the UN.  But the EU has never really been tested by violence so we have no idea if the other member countries will enforce EU decisions with force.  And the UN has already proven itself toothless many times over.<p>So again, I&#x27;m not saying that it would be RIGHT for Greece&#x27;s creditors to invade to force repayment, I am saying that it MIGHT happen.  And that it MIGHT be illegal, or it might not.  It depends on who wins since the victors write the history.",1435783059

Let me preface this by saying I&#x27;m not going to be repeating what&#x27;s already been said about non-technical user friendliness.<p>WordPress was my gateway in 2008-9 to web development. back when I was still a graphic design student. I started off hacking away at themes with my <i>extremely</i> limited HTML / CSS / PHP knowledge back then. Shit, my Google-fu was&#x27;t really even halfway decent then.<p>Today, thanks to the large community of developers working on the core WordPress project every day, and the sheer number of bug fixes, security updates, and new features that get added with each release -- there&#x27;s absolutely nothing to compare it to. It runs nearly a quarter of the entire internet.<p>And now, with the upcoming release of the JSON REST API as a part of core, developers will be able to take advantage of using WP as a data backend (read: users still control their content), while using the API to build applications with modern tech like React or Angular.<p>Just my two satoshis.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also like to point out that several (not all) hacks come from popular themes and plugins that are created by 3rd party authors / sources. Some of these are not available on the wordpress.org theme and plugin repositories, and usually this is due to not following certain standards. I would blame most successful hacks on brute force attempts against sites with admins who leave their username as the default admin and have incredibly weak passwords. I would also venture to say most of these hacks come from through exploits in third party code or out of date code, which users often fail to update.",1435782719

After just a few hours practice I was able to type the full keyboard (maybe minus some of the symbols) at ~60 wpm.  I didn&#x27;t do anything else with it until a few years later.<p>Around 10 years ago I made a complete switch and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Today I am still not faster with dvorak than I was with qwerty when I switched.  I was at 60-70 wpm for the first few weeks, and that was maddening.  But after a few weeks I think I got into the 80s and that was more tolerable.  Speed increases much beyond that are more about typing whole words or sequences of letters as a whole, and that tends to take longer to learn.  Now I type around 100 wpm.  I switched hoping to be able to type faster, so if that&#x27;s the measure of success, then dvorak failed.  I do think it&#x27;s possible for a better keyboard layout to speed you up, but dvorak isn&#x27;t that layout.  It is pretty clear that my fingers travel less distance on a dvorak keyboard than they did on qwerty.  Because of this, typing on dvorak has an overall &quot;calmer&quot; feel to it than qwerty.  I&#x27;ve heard some say that it helps their RSI problems.  I&#x27;ve never really suffered from RSI, so I can&#x27;t personally comment there.<p>In summary, I don&#x27;t mind that I changed, and if I could do it over, I still might do it again--but not for the same reasons.",1435782446

Hence the importance of being just as critical about oneself as one is about the stuff/people one’s being critical of.”</i><p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that there were certainly times when DFW did say some pretty wise things, not because he was a wise sage, but because I think he sat and thought about certain aspects of life deeply. So, I&#x27;m not sure why you would have a one-sided impression of him as an asshole. Similarly, he certainly did write things that sounded like he was on the verge of wanting to go off on people, not because he was an asshole, but because he was clinically depressed. Anyway, I guess you&#x27;ve chosen only to remember one side of his personality, so it sounds a bit disingenuous.

Ackadia had two systems that made it unique and wonderful.<p>If you were not resurrected from your corpse quickly enough it would decay and you would be forced to use one of the UO shrines. Each shrine would only work once. Once you had used all of them, that was it. You&#x27;d have to start a new character.<p>Secondly, monster spawns would spread out from dungeons if not periodically kept in check, eventually spawning in town and defeating the guards. This, combined with restricted travel, tended to condense the players into a smaller number of towns and gave real purpose and consequences to player organization and adventuring.<p>The result of this was that Ackadia had a tight-knit community, griefing was very rare, and you actually felt like you were accomplishing things other than making numbers go higher: helping and engaging with the community.",1435782149

The common use case is that you install various restarts as you go down the call stack; then, when an exception happens, control goes up the stack until appropriate decision code, which selects restart, and control goes <i>back down</i> the call stack to the selected restart block.<p>It&#x27;s an incredibly flexible system that makes exception handling much more useful.",1435781794

It was painstaking at first, hunt-and-peck, particularly since I didn&#x27;t have an actual labeled keyboard (I&#x27;d made a printout of the Dvorak layout instead).  Took me about 2 weeks to get up to about 30 WPM (I&#x27;d been a 90 WPM Qwerty touch-typist before).  It was another 6 months or so before I matched my Qwerty speed.  Oh, and in the process I forgot how to type in Qwerty; I eventually re-learned it, so I&#x27;m now bi-keyboardal, but it was unnerving at the time.  I&#x27;d say my typing speed now peaks at about 10% faster than it was then, but I&#x27;m usually thought-constrained and not typing-constrained.<p>I&#x27;d say it was worth it for a number of non-obvious reasons:<p>1. The <i>process</i> of switching is very illuminating about how our brain handles subconscious, autonomic tasks - much like how I imagine learning a new language is.  I found that about a week and a half in, I had <i>half</i> the keyboard mentally mapped in Qwerty and half mapped in Dvorak, such that I&#x27;d often type out unintelligible polyglot sentences.  And for several years later, I&#x27;d be triggered by whatever was up on the screen: if I had an IDE open, I&#x27;d automatically type in Qwerty, while if I had an AIM chat or word processor open it&#x27;d be Dvorak.  This is useful information whenever you&#x27;re trying to build a new habit.<p>2. It&#x27;s a built-in security device.  Even if someone gets ahold of your computer, they probably won&#x27;t be able to use it.<p>3. It helps a bunch with RSI.  You stay over home row much more with a Dvorak layout, there&#x27;s much less finger contortion, and so it&#x27;s correspondingly less strain on your hands.  Given how much I use my computer (and how I&#x27;m occasionally prone to tendonitis), this has been a godsend.",1435781754

You can have a consistent computation model in which memory seek times are constant (even if unrealizable). That seems fundamentally different from a model where  a hash computation is constant steps but also has arbitrarily long output.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t whether the scaling of the hash computation matters in practice, but whether the big-O is properly O(1). And even if you did just care about &quot;in practice&quot; limitations, you&#x27;re stuck with the problem of the hash computation taking longer than any realizable trie lookup would (as another poster mentioned is common), meaning that the O(1) claim misrepresents performance relative to another data structure.",1435781660

Americans are used to the system they have, it doesn&#x27;t cause any meaningful economic problems domestically (complaints come almost exclusively from foreigners). Businesses specifically want to show you the price they&#x27;re charging you, as apart from the taxes they&#x27;re forced to collect; that also enables businesses to charge a bit more in the rounding schemes (eg sell a blu-ray for $5 headline price, charge tax after; if they had to build tax into it, they&#x27;d lose ~6% on the pricing to use the rounding promotion approach). The US has 50 states with different tax schemes, that&#x27;s a nightmare for labeling goods.<p>For example, usually a bag of chips at Target or Walmart or a convenience store will say eg $3.99 printed on the bag. Some stores will slap their own dominant label on there, others choose not to.<p>Vendors often stock the shelves at stores, especially for certain categories of products, and store types. The chip delivery guy will stock the convenience store, Walmart, etc.<p>Chip production (eg Doritos) and delivery is limited to just a few factories, but they distribute to every state. For convenience, for decades, the companies have typically pre-stamped prices on chip bags.<p>So why not do it with hotels? Because no other segment of the economy tends to do it, and for the other reason mentioned: it cuts into price rounding advertising methods (or you have to raise prices to the next rounding).<p>If you want taxes built into the pricing on consumer goods, either they have to stop price labeling before delivery, or customize for every state.

That alone should tip off who&#x27;s in charge. Those in charge are not going to import cheap replacements for themselves, only for those not in charge.<p>As for &quot;why&quot;, I suspect that the significant fraction of programmers who don&#x27;t play office politics (I grant that it&#x27;s not all programmers, but a large portion of them) means that there&#x27;s no respect. Also, I believe that &quot;business people&quot; are at least subconsciously afraid of getting automated out of existence, or of having their secret(s) stolen. So, they marginalize programmers. I think you also have to consider that scapegoats are necessary for large projects - major portions of any large project come in late and over budget, or maybe just wrong. Gotta have a scapegoat to hang that on. Programmers are an obvious target due to the lack of political savvy, and having to deal with the reality of hardware, software, etc. Hang blame on a convenient group often enough, and that group ends up not being respected.",1435781167

Why pay for more capital and labor expenses to convert existing productive real estate into a generic, anodyne hotel experience with amenities like daily housekeeping service that I don&#x27;t need? One that&#x27;s probably located in the tourist-trap district? Instead, I can utilize existing capital more efficiently and enjoy myself in a real part of San Francisco designed for actual human beings, and spend the savings on something more relevant to my interests (like more frequent travel). Almost certainly this means more profits going to local businesses -- and to the homeowner as well, who is more likely to spend them locally than HotelCorp.<p>Granted, there are some contract issues if the host <i>rents</i> the apartment instead of owning it, and there is a risk of some externalities (chronic noisy guests upsetting neighbors) which could be managed with light regulation... but surely the idea is a sound one which should be embraced and encouraged. Right?<p>And those would-be unionized hotel employees would be there to do useful work for fair pay, no?

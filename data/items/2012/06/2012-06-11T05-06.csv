4093389,comment,4092887,4092887,1,0,KenCochrane,,,"Reading this blog post feels like it was written about me, the only difference is that I have two kids and my wife buys tons of shoes instead of clothes but I guess shoes are a form of clothes :)<p>When I was in college I used to build computers for friends and family to make some money on the side (ala michael dell) and offered free tech support along with those computers. Well it wasn't always free, my grandmother always insisted on paying something so I charged her a dozen cookies that she would mail to me in college and I would share them with my friends.<p>Anyway, I quickly learned that the free support was killing me, and I didn't have much time to support this stuff in college, so I started recommending that people buy dell computers, because back then, they had the best customer support and there products were pretty good.<p>It didn't take long before Dell shipped their customer support folks over seas and people started coming back to me for support. By that time I was out of school, and I didn't mind helping out my friends and family. Soon enough I got married and had a couple of kids.<p>Once that happened I stopped having all this wonderful free time I used to have in my youth, and as the guy in the blog post mentions, I had better things to do with my time, and I  ended up buying my first mac, after a couple of my friends talked about how much they loved developing on it.<p>When I first got my mac, I was surprised how great it was for developing software. I mostly develop with open source software, so having the shell there with all the wonderful goodness made it great to get up and running quickly. This compared to all the hacks and work arounds you needed to do on windows (cygwin anyone?).<p>After using the mac for a little while and then having to go support the friends and family with windows, was really hard, because stuff that just worked on a mac, was a PITA on windows. I started recommending mac's to my relatives and a wonderful thing happened. My aunt who used to call me once a week stopped calling me. I hadn't noticed that she didn't call for a while until I saw her at a family event and I asked how she liked her new computer. She was so happy, she said it took a little bit of getting used to, but she should have done it years ago. The crazy printer and scanner that she always had problems with in the past, just worked when she plugged it in, no configurations, no printer drivers nothing to install, it just worked. In the past few years I think she has only called me once, and that was because she wanted to know what model macbook she should by her daughter for college.<p>The other great thing about apple, is that there is an apple store at the local mall, and my relatives can go in there and get their questions answered in person, and take classes. Best of all the phone support for apple is bar none, if you haven't used it before, which some people haven't because the apple products are pretty reliable, then you are missing out. There is rarely a long wait on hold, and the phone call is really clear and quiet, they aren't sending you to a big call center where everyone is in the same warehouse using cheap voip phones. If they are, they are using great headsets with noise reducing microphones :)<p>I have a couple of friends that have switched as well, and one of them is a big time windows fan and gamer, and said he would never switch because mac's aren't good enough to play video games. He has a machine he built just for games, and it is true that mac's don't have all the same games, but he says that the games that they do have on Mac run better on the mac, and he thinks it is because the underlying OS is much better on a mac so the games are more stable.<p>My brother in law, who for some reason always hated apple, has recently bought an iPad and replaced his huge android phone with an iPhone. He said he always avoided the apple products because he didn't want to be called a fan boy, but when he actually sat down and used one, he was surprised how good they were compared to what he had been using. He just needed to give it a chance.<p>Some people complain about the price difference, and now a days the price isn't as big a difference as the past. But, I use the following argument when people bring up the price difference. Kia's and BMW's, are both cars, the BMW is more expensive, but it has more features, and is more fun to drive. You don't need the BMW but if you can afford it, you won't be disappointed you bought one. If the world bought everything according to price, then everyone would be driving Kia's. Life it short, spend your time on earth enjoying the products you own.<p>So for me, the apple products just work, and they are a major time saver, both with my software development and for dealing with support. If these same products were made by different companies I would still buy them, it has nothing to do with the fact that they are made by apple.",1339394266

Now, don't get me wrong. I love the attention to detail in every other part of their business. It's just their website (and similar things, like the abysmal Amazon MP3 app for Android) that are the problem.<p>I hate that I need to log in 3 times within the space of 5 minutes as I hit different parts of the site that apparently are considered more and more sensitive.<p>I hate the way they keep on misleadingly suggesting that items might be eligible for free shipping when they aren't (every possible signal from the user profile to ip geo-location should be indicating that I'm the wrong country for that).<p>I despise the way they keep on defaulting me back to paying in the wrong currency with their rip-off ""amazon currency converter"" with worse exchange rates than my credit card.<p>I can't believe that in this day and age they aren't able to synchronize anything except the most rudimentary profile data across their different domains.

> <i>""Religion bypasses the scientific method""</i><p>Do you have any sort of evidence to support these assertions?  Can you explain precisely what it is about religion that makes it necessarily incompatible with the scientific method?  You've waved your hands in the direction of falsifiability, but haven't really made a specific argument to that effect (and I don't think you understand the concept of falsifiability very well; more on this below.)<p>I concede that some people's approach to religion is not evidential.  I concede that some people make religious claims which are not falsifiable.  But you have erroneously assumed this is a <i>necessity of religion</i> rather than simply the failing of some individuals.  You have asserted that <i>""most religious people would try to claim that god was just testing their faith""</i>, and perhaps that is true among the religious subgroups you've interacted with, but that's not the approach I see among my subgroups.<p>-------<p>> <i>""I would be curious to know what mechanism is used to do this, and why you think it's more plausible than your own brain communicating with yourself.""</i><p>The mechanism might be described as telepathy: a thought coming into someone's mind which is not their own thought, and which was not communicated through known physical means (such as sound or sight).<p>I describe a few of these experiences later in the linked thread [0] -- things like hearing turn-by-turn directions to previously unknown locations, or being told to give a particular item to a stranger who had some specific need for that exact item.  It is implausible that this is just my own brain, specifically because it's information my brain <i>doesn't have</i> at the time it's communicated.<p>Verifying someone is a follower of the same God is much like verifying that someone else is really friends with your mother -- they give accurate and specific descriptions which correspond to your own observations, and their behavior shows the appropriate characteristics.  Verifying they're telling the truth about these experiences is much like verifying someone is telling the truth about any other experience -- partly it comes down to their credibility on other, verifiable matters (do they lie about what they were doing yesterday?), partly it comes down to the details of their story (do they get tripped up when retelling it?  Is the level of detail consistent and appropriate for a true story?), and partly it comes down to the same thing as validates it's not a hallucination: there's some tangible result, such as their having found a specific person at a specific location who needed a specific item.  All of the bits of scrutiny you accuse me of not applying, I have applied, and I've found that my position stands fairly strong while the alternate explanations people tend to propose are woefully inadequate [1].<p>> <i>""What evidence did you find to make you more religious?""</i><p>Partly the above experiences, and personality/behavioral changes I've observed in myself and others directly following similar experiences (I regularly ask thoughtful atheists for explanations, with the honest desire for viable alternatives, but they always end up with goofy explanations requiring some combination of telepathic aliens, very honest people lying, and an unreasonable amount of luck.)  A lot of it has been examinations of what are supposedly the ""best"" secular theories about some of the things my wife describes in [2], such as the origins of the New Testament gospels, and finding those explanations not to correspond to the evidence very well while the Christian explanations do [3].<p>-------<p>Now, you've made the same mistake about falsifiability that appeared in the other thread [4].  Specifically, you've attempted to apply the criteria of falsifiability to <i>experiences or observations</i>, and complained that supernatural experiences don't qualify.  But falsifiability doesn't apply to observations/data, it applies to theories/explanations.  Falsifiability means that a <i>theory</i> is constructed such that, if it was false, you can conceive of a particular set of data that would be inconsistent with the theory [5].  ""I counted three white swans"" is data and therefore has no relation to falsifiability; ""all swans are white"" is a theory which is falsifiable.  Likewise, ""I heard a voice that told me to do X"" is data; ""I recognize the voice of God, who tells me to do things which He's always right about"" is a falsifiable theory (if I hear what I think is the voice of God tell me to do something that turns out to be wrong, say, ""such-and-such person will be at such-and-such place"" and they're not there, this is not consistent with the theory.)<p>You are correct that I haven't brought up sufficient evidence to justify religion as a correct belief; that's well beyond the scope of a Hacker News post.  All I hope to show here is that religion is not necessarily incompatible with the evidential approach that characterizes science, and that some people who take an evidential approach become or remain religious without ""compartmentalizing"".<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2971781"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2971781</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3016150"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3016150</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2971214"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2971214</a><p>[3] if you're willing to spend some time, watch from about 9:00 to 33:00 of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Ylt1pBMm8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Ylt1pBMm8</a> for a fairly intriguing argument about the names, and disambiguators, present in the gospels<p>[4] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2956963"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2956963</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability</a>",1339393684

He now has any and all of your passwords and logins with no effort.<p>My point is that for all this talk about security it seems really dumb for a prominent player (any prominent player) to not take extra steps to ensure that our valuable data is secure within reason.  With LinkedIn the problem is, at the very least, the lack of anything beyond SHA-1 to protect passwords.  Bad idea.  In the browser case, it seems to me that, unless the intent is to provide a browser used only by those like us who understand and are very aware of security issues, it might just be a good idea to put in a few things that will make it harder for curious eyes or the 16 year old  at the repair shop to grab all of your login data.<p>I don't propose nor do I expect perfection or absolute security, but what Chrome does today is, in my opinion, at the very least irresponsible.  The uninformed user has NO IDEA WHATSOEVER that a huge security hole exists in their browser.  Maybe we need to stop thinking in our terms and focus on mom, dad, uncle or grandma.  When you first install Chrome you should, at the very least, see a screen telling you about security and the options you might have.  I think that a master passwords would most-definitely serve a purpose in the case of ""innocent"" peeking.  Yes, with pro's all bets are off.

It does drop a pin for Caltech on the map, and the Cordon Bleu pin is a different color, but it would be easy for someone not expecting this to end up driving to the Cordon Bleu location.<p>To get the driving directions to Caltech, you have to tap on the destination text field, and a list of destinations drops down, with Caltech (the one I <i>explicitly</i> told Google was my destination) listed second, behind the sponsored Cordon Bleu item.<p>I asked Android users at work, and none of them had ever seen their destinations replaced with a sponsored destination like that. I've also never seen it happen on the web-based Google maps.",1339390856

He struck me as an interesting individual with an interesting resume (http://oldcoder.org/general/misc/aboutme.html#SECTION02 -- Berkeley dual-major graduate, cum magna laude), who surprisingly was willing to help me out on my school assignments, and with my internship projects (programming, and so on). He didn't tell me much about him in the beginning, but I eventually came to found out that he was an autistic 50-something year old individual who was wheelchair-bound, with some sort of speech impediment, and he was penniless (often complaining about coming close to homelessness, and fearing death from sickness). Now I've come to find out that his brother (who I understand is the guy behind the Amazon Kindle) is trying to have him arrested.<p>He's written his side of the story here: http://details.wikidot.com/ -- and though to me it reads a little peculiar at times, I think he's quite frustrated for all that he has suffered over the years (strong physical and emotional abuse when he was young). The court proceedings will apparently be in a few days, is there anything I can suggest to him to help his case? I'll be passing a link directly to him to this thread -- please feel free to address advice directly to him.",1339390811

Not only that, but many have families, making that very expensive very quickly.<p>Speaking of families, prepaid doesn't cater well to families either! For most carriers, you can add a line for what, $10 a month (I use T-Mobile)? In my family of 4, a family plan would cost around $100 to $110 (without data).<p>The cheapest prepaid plans are now around $30 so a family of 4 would cost $120. Granted, that would include data, which I don't have. But with a contract plan, I would also get unlimited calling to others on the same carrier and free calling at night. Many Americans still actually use their phones as phones, so that's a huge plus that prepaid carriers don't offer.<p>So while prepaid works for many, it still isn't the perfect solution for a large majority of us.<p>One sidenote: If you're on T-Mobile, you can wait for phones to go on sale for free after 2 year contract and then get the cheapest data plan ($10 a month for 200mb) and your cost of the smartphone comes out to $240 over two years. Yes, if you HADN'T gone with the subsidy and brought your own phone (not to prepaid, but the other option T-Mobile has), your plan would be $10 less per month, but if you have a family, the benefits stated above quickly make that $10 feel a lot weaker. PM me if you don't quite understand.",1339390809

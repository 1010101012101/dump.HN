When you evaluate two alternatives, it is not enough to say &quot;A is bad for these reasons&quot; or &quot;B is good for these reasons&quot;.

Let&#x27;s assume for the sake of argument that this is true. How this makes government-run prison <i>better than</i> private? If citizens do not care, they also wouldn&#x27;t care if prisoners were abused in government-run prison. Moreover, if <i>some</i> citizens care, what is easier for them to overcome - a lobby of one private company (which can be, ultimately, fired, its reputation destroyed, and in extreme cases, whole company bankrupt and dissolved) - against which other private companies and lobbies can be also used as allies, or the alliance of state bureaucracy and public employees unions, which can not be seriously hurt (most of their power is constitutionally protected or at least enshrined in the law so hard that you need truly exceptional clout to change it), which have access to vast amounts of budget money and control well-organized and battle-hardened political machine with national support? What is easier to fight - the ones that have the money or the ones that have the money, the law, the executive power, the people, the press and the human resources?

The thought, because of the efficiency differences of the albedo-vs-&quot;heat blanket&quot; effect that clouds bring, was that it was a net-warming effect that contrails cause.

  vulnerable to disastrous fires, which raged through dense 
  clusters of mostly wooden buildings. It took a giant fire 
  in Chicago to spur government officials into serious 
  reforms, including limits on new wooden structures, a 
  more robust water supply for suppressing blazes and an 
  overhaul to the city’s fire department.


  “The market didn’t solve the problem of cities burning 
  down,” Wysopal said, predicting that Internet security 
  may require a historic disaster to force change. “It 
  seems to me that the market isn’t really going to solve 
  this one on its own.”

  But here’s a frightening fact: The push to create tough 
  new fire-safety standards did not start after the Great 
  Chicago Fire in 1871, which killed hundreds of people and 
  left 100,000 homeless. It took a second fire, nearly 
  three years later in 1874, to get officials in Chicago to 
  finally make real changes.</code></pre>",1435171212

In my own mind, I think of global climate change in a more simplistic way: global energy change. We humans are releasing, in short order, energies that took natural processes millions of years to convert to the form that we&#x27;re liberating. I can&#x27;t think of any other philosophy or activity done by humankind that wantonly, aggressively and cavalierly &quot;blows the wad&quot; without experiencing a terrible consequence as a result of upsetting the balance.<p>Matter can be subject to a chemical or physical process that liberates the energies that keep it together. Temperature is one form of energy that is liberated. It&#x27;s how power is generated -- we used that heat energy to, usually, make another fluid move faster, and convert that to mechanical energy by way of a turbine, and convert that mechanical energy to electricity, by way of rotating magnets inducing electrical current in a conductor. That matter that we burn/react/oxidize doesn&#x27;t convert wholly to energy, though. Some of the physical waste products go into the atmosphere, changing how the air itself itself reacts to various energetic inputs, such as sunlight or radiative heat from urban centers. We literally convert matter that took millions of years to make into energies and waste matter that were not there in those quantities for those same millions of years, and the simple, basic physics of it is that the result of that conversion is waste matter and energies that serve to either directly increase heat energy (a small part of human-induced climate change) or change the energy storage properties of the largest, by mass, energy batteries around: the atmosphere and the oceans.<p>So, yes, when there are stronger hurricanes and more destructive tornadoes outlasting their historical durations and exceeding their historical energies, there is little else but temperature that causes that to happen.  And, yes, it goes the same way for winter.<p>This same climate change can have a chilling effect on winters, due to the changes in the propagation of that energy-as-temperature affecting the jet stream or deep ocean currents. The atmosphere and the ocean are huge, dynamic, swirling masses of differing energies, and the weather we experience is a result of how those masses of air and water move, said motion being a product of their energies (again, temperature). Wind itself, hurricanes, storms, blizzards, tornadoes, etc. are all caused by the interaction of large masses of air at differing densities (itself one effect of temperature). The energy imparted to those air masses comes, in no small part, from the ocean.<p>I think if more people equated &quot;temperature&quot; with &quot;energy&quot;, the layman&#x27;s summaries of climate change may reach a few more skeptics. At least, the ones who want to learn.",1435170107

There is, however, another way to get code running in Redis... it is called a GitHub Pull Request :) If you&#x27;ve thunk up something really amazing/useful and coded it, drop by the redis-dev mailing list to discuss it, maybe do an RCP and submit your code. No one promises that your PR will be accepted, but even if it won&#x27;t make its way into the core, anyone will be able to use it nonetheless.<p>Another point worth mentioning in this context is that in order to even contemplate such a mechanism, Redis&#x27; core will need heavy refactoring of the internal API. This is by all accounts a huge effort that, if taken by the developer, is likely to postpone a lot of other important work.",1435169575

I do know it is wrong in saying that the RSS troposphere shows more warming than UAH since 1998, because RSS shows zero warming since 1998. Don&#x27;t trust me, please look at the data yourself.<p>But the land temperature stations have a miasma of questionable adjustments hanging around them. The stations themselves are not often well situated for clean readings, and then when the data is adjusted for heat island effects, rural stations will be adjusted upwards far more than urban areas will be adjusted downwards. I can&#x27;t imagine why rural stations would ever be adjusted upwards, except on a case by case basis. But either way, the confidence intervals become mere guesses. It&#x27;s unconscionable to mix that data with the more scientifically rigorous satellite data.<p>There&#x27;s no getting around that the UAH and RSS sets show little to no warming for nearly 2 decades (RSS is 19 years and 6 months, and UAH 6.0 [most references to UAH will be 5.6 which is outdated] lines up nearly perfectly with RSS).<p>[Edited for mobile grammar mistakes]",1435169516

Forests use more for work than any static object. The only open question in my mind is how much so. You do raise the point of emitting water vapor which adds a lot to the complexity. Also the rotting biomass will produce a lot of heat. But the production of dirt is probably still a net use of the energy. Remember, coal is old biomass and contains a lot of energy that came from the sun.<p>>> As an aside, I believe forests generate heat, just like any biological system.<p>You would be wrong in that. All chemical processes in the forest are ultimately powered by sunlight. Your body produces heat, but that&#x27;s due to chemical reactions that primarily amount to burning fuel (fats are essentially hydrocarbons and the primary products of their &quot;burning&quot; is CO2 and H20 which exit through the lungs).

9773333,comment,9771493,9772942,0,0,Zuider,,,"Hans von Storch, professor at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg discussed this issue in a recent interview with Der Spiegel. He remarked that less than 2% of model runs reproduced the &#x27;pause&#x27;.<p><a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-hans-von-storch-on-problems-with-climate-change-models-a-906721.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-hans-von...</a><p>SPIEGEL: Just since the turn of the millennium, humanity has emitted another 400 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, yet temperatures haven&#x27;t risen in nearly 15 years. What can explain this?<p>Storch: So far, no one has been able to provide a compelling answer to why climate change seems to be taking a break. We&#x27;re facing a puzzle. Recent CO2 emissions have actually risen even more steeply than we feared. As a result, according to most climate models, we should have seen temperatures rise by around 0.25 degrees Celsius (0.45 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 10 years. That hasn&#x27;t happened. In fact, the increase over the last 15 years was just 0.06 degrees Celsius (0.11 degrees Fahrenheit) -- a value very close to zero. This is a serious scientific problem that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will have to confront when it presents its next Assessment Report late next year.<p>SPIEGEL: Do the computer models with which physicists simulate the future climate ever show the sort of long standstill in temperature change that we&#x27;re observing right now?<p>Storch: Yes, but only extremely rarely. At my institute, we analyzed how often such a 15-year stagnation in global warming occurred in the simulations. The answer was: in under 2 percent of all the times we ran the simulation. In other words, over 98 percent of forecasts show CO2 emissions as high as we have had in recent years leading to more of a temperature increase.",1435169024

I would bet they these individuals will acquire expertise, develop new knowledge, and create new things that will be highly benificial to society.<p>This is very similar we what do with grants to scientists conducting general research.

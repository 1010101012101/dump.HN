It can be quite powerful, in particular when working with linked lists, nested structures, etc. \nUnfortunately there was not much active development in the past years. I think it being developed using a nowadays uncommon toolkit does not help. As far as I know there were attemts to move DDD to Qt or GTK to reactivate development and maybe make it more portable but these attempts apparently did not bear any visible fruits.\nIt would be nice to see DDD development come to live again.",1423663197

I was having beers with an old friend from undergrad yesterday - our career paths have taken us very different places. What&#x27;s common is that both of our employers have been instituting agile in very dysfunctional forms. My friend and I are both in our 30s and we were jokingly thinking how long we can take this crap before we have to either move to management or change careers completely (unlikely since we love tech so much).<p>I would not put unit testing in the same camp - frankly, my employer doesn&#x27;t care about unit testing at all - to my chagrin. Senior developers sneak in unit tests on the minutes of breathing room we get. I actually got a lecture on &quot;company cares about customer visible features&quot;. Well .. you know what? Software that doesn&#x27;t crash is a pretty darned customer visible feature.<p>What makes me very uncomfortable is that my current situation reminds me of what I saw on the news about the BP oil spill incident. Management asks very pointed and specific questions - engineers answer truthfully. Mgmt makes wild decisions based on half information. I fear this kind of crap is rampant  in organizations not run by technical people.

This kind of thing came up often while making posters for campus because it was cheaper to NOT print out all of the posters on Tabloid.  Rather, using a mix of Tabloid (for the important poster posting spots) and Letter (for unimportant spots and as flyers for handout).  Always ended up having to spend more time to make two layouts because of it. And A4 to A5 for booklets without having to re-layout the document is a huge plus too! And for books, I like to use B4* to fold in half. (B5 pages are nicer than A5 pages for the kind of books I tend to read.) The proportions are all the same, so it just works!  One layout, many paper size (of the same proportion) possibilities!<p>Edit:  Additional note with regard to the book publication (depending on printing and binding method used)... Sometimes/often this is printed on something like A3 size for bleeding and with crop marks. The A3 paper is then folded and cut, so that the pages become B5 size. (Signatures essentially composed of folded B4 as a consequence of the cropping.  There is of course difference between the outermost sheet and the innermost sheet in each paper signature, which is why it&#x27;s all cropped at the end.)",1423661702

As the article notes, &quot;who would be responsible in the event of a collision&quot; still needs to be considered.

9032564,comment,9032220,9032460,0,0,lucaspiller,,,"I purposely bought a Philips smart TV this year as the only stuff I really watch is Netflix, iPlayer, YouTube and my own ripped content. This TV advertised apps for all of that and DLNA support, so I figured I wouldn&#x27;t need any other boxes. I have used XBMC before and that worked great, except there is still no Netflix support, so I figured I&#x27;d try something with it built in.<p>Netflix works perfectly, and I really can&#x27;t complain about it. The interface is very user friendly and it is very responsive. I guess it&#x27;s pretty much the same as you get on an Apple TV or Amazon whatever-its-called box, but it&#x27;s nice to have it built in.<p>YouTube works pretty well. It&#x27;s sometimes a bit slow to skip to the next video, but being able to use my phone or laptop as a remote to queue up content is pretty nice.<p>iPlayer is pretty hopeless. If I play a SD video it plays in the wrong aspect ratio, and HD video just keeps buffering (Netflix 720p is fine though...). The interface is nice though.<p>DLNA started off well, the browser is pretty basic but even over wifi I was able to stream 1080p which was impressive. Then some videos I tried just crashed the player randomly after 10 minutes, so I gave up on that.<p>I&#x27;ve now got a Raspberry Pi with XBMC/Kodi running. It&#x27;s a bit slow (seems to be inefficiencies of the software, as even idle in the menu it uses 80% of the CPU), but 1080p movies play back fine even over wifi. I use that in place of the DLNA on my TV and use get_iplayer to fix that. They both support HDMI CEC which means I can use just the TV remote to control the Raspberry Pi without any addons.<p>There are a few other things I should mention too:<p>The whole interface of the TV is HTML and Javascript (it runs Opera 9 under the hood) and it isn&#x27;t very optimised. This means even simple things such as pressing the &#x27;Source&#x27; button to view the source list (you can&#x27;t just press it to switch, you need to press this then select the new source from the menu) takes 30 seconds to load.<p>I specifically bought this TV and an amplifier (both Philips) that support HDMI ARC, this means that audio can be sent from the TV (or peripherals) to the amplifier via just the HDMI cable. When it works it works great, but most of the time for whatever reason it just doesn&#x27;t. I ended up buying a $3 optical S/PDIF cable from eBay which works as expected (i.e. it just works) and achieves the same end goal. If I&#x27;d known it would have been this flakey, I would have just gone that route in the first place and I could have got a cheaper amplifier.<p>The TV also has Skype built in, and an optional camera for $100. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy that at the same time as the TV...<p>So what&#x27;s the purpose of a smart TV? I have no idea. I would prefer a &#x27;dumb&#x27; TV, but it seems pretty much everything is a smart TV now.<p>Edit:<p>I also looked into building my own interface for it. The &#x27;Smart TV&#x27; home screen has ads on it loaded over HTTP, so I setup my router to sent that traffic to my own server and served up a JavaScript redirect. It worked well, but I never got around to taking it further. According to the spec [0] the TV supports 1080p60 x264 at 25 Mbit/s.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.yourappontv.com/documentation/smart-tv-versions-spec/smart-tv-version-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yourappontv.com/documentation/smart-tv-versions-s...</a> (free signup required)",1423659701

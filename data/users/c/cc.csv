ccashwell_,0,6,0.0,0,0,"I&#x27;m an entrepreneur, technologist, advisor and investor. I help transform ideas into successful products and services that focus on disrupting and redefining how people think. I have a proven track record of leading geographically distributed teams and helping develop and execute strategies that win. I have a deep passion for working closely with founding teams of early stage startups in capacities ranging from directly contributing to full-stack development efforts to helping refine business goals, raise funding and beyond.<p>I believe in building a better kind of business driven by principles like integrity and authenticity. My life&#x27;s work is centered around making a meaningful impact on the world and supporting others in doing the same, and I&#x27;m always looking for opportunities to give back. I like to invest in smart people doing good things with greater goals.<p>I&#x27;ve built software, including several notable cloud-based and native web and mobile apps, that touch millions of consumers and tens of thousands of government employees in the US and abroad every day and solve real-world problems at scale. I&#x27;ve worked with venture-backed tech startups, Fortune 500 companies and everything in between to help make groundbreaking innovations in diverse spaces, ranging from payments and consumer protection to real-time communications and telemedicine. My work has helped secure millions in private capital from VCs and angel investors, as well as numerous US government contracts and grant awards.<p>I&#x27;m an autodidact who literally never stops learning. When I&#x27;m not working, I&#x27;m usually reading heady material on mycology, mineralogy, paleontology, archaeology, psychology... pretty much anything that ends in &quot;​-ology&quot;, learning new earth skills, building some sort of contraption to do my chores, romping around some remote mountain/forest/desert, or traveling across the country with my equally nerdy wife.",1421870434,1453166560

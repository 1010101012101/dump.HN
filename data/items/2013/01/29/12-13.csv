You don't have school teams or schools competing against each other, instead various junior sports teams are simply local and geographical, drawing kids from surrounding schools.<p>And junior sports activites are completely extra-curricular. A local team might have its activities at a single school, so as a student you might have your after-school basketball at your school, or another school, it all depends. You still have a lot of people watching professional sports, and working their way up through junior sports, but the ""high-school jock"" clich simply does not exist.<p>And, consequently, athletic proficiency isn't mixed with academic proficiency, the school doesn't care about how good a student is at basketball or football or whatever, that's completely outside its interests. And academic scholarships based on athletic skill is unheard of. (Then again, scholarships are pretty unheard of, university education is free... :) )",1359464215

5133628,comment,5133419,5133419,2,0,kellishaver,,,"I think the list of things that can make a relationship fail is probably long and varied and very different from person to person, but I'll offer up my two cents.<p>One of the biggest challenges for me has been the ways in which my husband and I have both changed over the years, sometimes growing together and sometimes as individuals, both of which are healthy and normal, but navigating a relationship during those periods can be difficult. The dynamics, expectations, and what the other person can bring to the relationship are in flux during those times and may end up on something different than where you started. There are times when I've felt disconnected, held back, or left, behind, maybe even a little unloved or resented, and I know he's had times where he's felt the same way. Again, I think it's normal to have periods like that in any 17+yr relationship and we've weathered them well (in general) but I can understand how some people would not.<p>I think this is particularly true of people who enter into these relationships at a younger age. As much as I thought I did, I don't think I truly knew ""who I was"" until I was closer to 30 and had enough life experiences to really figure that out for myself.<p>Another factor I see often, though it isn't an issue for us, is that I see people relying too heavily on that one relationship or giving up other relationships for it. I know a lot of women who think that because they are married, they can't have male friends, or people who think they can't go out and enjoy an evening with friends unless their partner comes along. Sometimes these assumptions are wrong, sometimes they really would upset/anger the other party involved. This, to me is wrong. You don't build trust in a relationship by never extending it and you don't grow as a person if everything you do includes a plus one. You end up with an odd sort of co-dependence and isolation (the fact that I see this happen so often could be somewhat cultural due to the region of the country in which I live).<p>So for me, the two biggest realizations have been that:<p>1. I'm in this relationship because I want to be, not because I have to be and that I need to be happy with myself before I can expect someone else to be able to live with me happily. I need to be allowed to be my own person and explore that and my partner needs the same. We both need to be able to form meaningful friendships with other people on our own terms, not dictated by the other, but also remaining respectful of them.\n2. Changes in the dynamics of a relationship over time are perfectly normal and healthy, even though they can, at times, be really hard. Maybe it's not what you thought it would be when you signed up for this, but it can still be pretty great, and 5, 10, 15+ years of shared history, experiences, love, and support is something worth sticking around for and working on.<p>As for whether or not I am fully satisfied with my current relationship, yes, I am, very much. I get a little annoyed sometimes at some of the sacrifices I feel I am making because of my husband's current situation (e.g. I really want to move to another part of the country, but it's not possible right now due to some commitments he has), but the relationship is completely worth it and isn't suffering because of it.",1359463054

No one is going to look over your shoulder or interrupt you in a coffee shop. You can put on noise-canceling headphones and sit with your back to a wall. Only a small percentage of the evil of open-plan offices is noise-related.<p>It's the emotional load of being visible to people who can fuck with their livelihood for any reason or no reason that makes open-plan offices terrible. People become resentful, competitive, and miserable. Those environments are said to foster collaboration, but have the opposite effect, because most people shut down at a certain level of sensory and social overload, the result being that communication grinds to a halt.<p>Open-plan offices are said to be egalitarian, but in practice, they increase rank discrepancies and social inequalities, because they reflect an unconditional right of management to harass and monitor subordinates.<p>The other interesting thing is that there's a lot of evidence suggesting that almost everyone (over 90%) will develop work-related health problems in an open-plan office. The question is how long it will take. Median seems to be about 10-15 years, making open-plan offices a legal way to say, ""We don't want to hire anyone over 40"".",1359463041

The <i>whole point</i> of digital stuff is that we can make nearly-instantaneous, perfect replicas with negligent overhead. That's why we convert and encode stuff as strings of repeatable digits. Attempting to limit the number of copies of mass-produced, digitized media in circulation is not only silly but totally futile. They simply must accept that the old monetization model based on artificially controlled scarcity is no longer tenable. As Bruce Schneier says, trying to make digital bits not copyable is like trying to make water not wet. It's an inextricable property of the medium.<p>Your example of the app store is actually good, and shows a good monetization path that actually benefits from the inherent properties of the digital medium. You're right that some people still try to pirate 99 cent apps, but in my experience those people aren't part of the audience in the first place, because they don't have the 99 cents to spend, or they wouldn't be wasting hours and days to save themselves a few dollars. The time of <i>anyone with a job</i> is significantly more valuable than that. While there are always going to be a few penny wise and pound foolish irrational actors in the mix, you can't cripple your business based on that kind of rabid obsession. You have to let it go at some point.<p>It's time to give up the archaic, draconian copyright regime that demands total control of a PC before it allows it to display a movie and reasonably embrace our digitized future, including building monetization models that aren't ""sue filesharers"".",1359462832

I am just surprised how many people try to circumvent JS: Rubyists with Coffee, Closurists with ClosureScript, etc. instead of just using JS directly. I don't believe the main motivation is JS' potential inferiority and that you could employ much better design pattern with languages compiling to JS. Neither, JS' syntax is bad or ugly. I assume that's it's the fear of learning something new, to be again a beginner. JS has its quirks but in general it's a very modern and beautiful language and offering more innovation than traditional scripting languages. And V8 is so blazingly fast that I sometimes think this feels more like C compiled code which would be just another reason rather to switch to JS in the backend.",1359462823

So what I write here is based solely on the premise of the headline and existing comments on HN.<p>I work for a co-working space in London, which is like an open plan office taken to the extreme. Before that I worked in a variety of environments (I'm in my 30s), including public sector 'one-office-per-person' through to agency '3-people-per-desk' type situations, and working from home as a freelancer.<p>Criticisms about working space often come down to 'the garden on the other side of the fence would be easier to work in'. If you work from home, you miss having people to have coffee with at lunch. If you work in a crowded office, you miss having 2 hours of unbroken flow. So the best offices try to combine a bit of everything - quiet space, play space, etc.<p>Some people talk about the 'email-only' office like the Holy Grail of Offices. But it's not - it's cold, impersonal and unfriendly. It often results in unnecessary arguments resulting from people misinterpreting something. So a culture of ""speak, don't write"" is definitely a good thing, as long as there are some rules about when it's OK to talk to someone.<p>The problem is whether people respect the rules. We try to follow the headphone rule - if I'm wearing headphones, don't interrupt me unless the building is about to burn down. The corollary - if I'm not wearing headphones, feel free to walk up and talk to me.<p>So it's as much about culture as it is architecture, and that's something that often gets overlooked.",1359462804

It's just a general distaste/annoyance that occurs every time I get involved in JavaScript code, either the reading or the writing of it. Python, on the other hand, is nearly readable by non-programmers, and is otherwise super cool. I recognize that others may have a different opinion on this than I have and while they're not necessarily wrong for themselves, I believe Python is more accessible in general.<p>I think the facts that a) almost no one writes bare in-browser JavaScript anymore, it's all through jQuery and b) CoffeeScript and other persistent ""rewrite/simplify/improve JS"" movements exist and keep coming up are ample evidence that the basic tools provided by the browser and the JS language are insufficient.",1359461887

Technical debt too often ends up being an always growing burden on the shoulders on the next developers who have to touch the stinking pile with the business around asking: ""Why is it taking so long to code such a small modification? In the end, the applications already WORKS!"".<p>I agree that code has to respect time and money budget, but the budget must respect the code, too! The biggest problem in our industry is that too many of us have made non technical people believe that ""with software, everything is possible"", just to have a project failing after another when the fairy tales world crashes with reality.<p>As Alex put it: ""We are practically the only industry where completion and success are synonymous. If the foundation of a one-year-old home is crumbling and its roof is plagued with leaks, would anybody actually call that a success? Of course not!

I don't think I need any other fancy features, I already get things done the right way.

One-one-hundredth of a percent.<p>At that level, I think it's possible that some fantastic scripts slip through the cracks.<p>There's the highly prestigious Nicholl Fellowship, run by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, that awards up to 10 fellows a year based on their sample scripts.

But when you drop below the A list and look at the marginal, non-blockbuster movies, do you really need a good script to make money?  Do producers and directors <i>need</i> a good writer?  Is a good script or a good writer an asset to them at all?<p>To put it another way, what is a ""good"" script from the point of view of the movie industry, and how many people actually want to write one, and would be willing to put their real name on it?<p>If you look outside the blockbusters, and even at many blockbusters themselves, most scripts aren't that good.  I know a few people who watch a lot of terrible movies who are kind of allergic to quality, or at least allergic to the aspiration to quality.  They are tolerant of crap and want their movies to be tolerant, too.  A friend of mine is a huge fan of horror and action movies, and the only movie he has ever walked out of was ""The Thin Red Line.""  Why did that movie offend him, out of all the movies he's seen?  It wasn't because it was bad.  (He and I saw ""Deuce Bigalo:  European Gigolo"" in the theater.)  It offended him because it insulted his taste.  It aspired to be <i>better</i> than the movies he liked.  That's what I'm guessing, anyway.<p>So if you're in the movie industry and trying to get a non-A-list movie made, you have to think about who's going to go see it.  Writing a ""good"" script by your own standards may be a mistake.  Maybe writing a ""good"" script only proves you don't understand the business and won't be an asset to the people who can help you.  Maybe showing some hustle, some talent at getting noticed, and some crass instincts is necessary, not to draw attention to your good writing -- nobody gives a shit about your writing -- but because hustle, self-promotion, and crassness is how you prove you can succeed in the industry and help them make money in the future.",1288478856

1851952,comment,1850894,1850894,0,0,fdschoeneman,,,"It seems you're experiencing a couple of problems.  Allow me to restate them:<p>1) You don't have many friends, and (I assume, though this isn't clear) that you wish you had more.<p>2) You feel your educational institutions are failing you, in the sense that they are not educating you.<p>3) You are ashamed of yourself, and things that you have done, so much so that it keeps you from moving forward with studying or doing well in school and, (I also assume) working on things outside of school.<p>You then made a specific request for advice on how you can forget what you see as your shitty past, because you believe this will help you to move forward.<p>Sound about right?<p>Well okay let's deal with #1 first.  How to get more friends and be less lonely.  Most people can't control whether or not other people think they're funny, or think they're cool, or like them.  Seriously.  Walk up to someone and try to make them like you.  It doesn't work, even if you are charming or funny or cool.  But what you can control is whether or not you are a good person.  A good person helps others out without the expectation of reward.  A good person doesn't talk shit about people behind their backs.  A good person stands up for those weaker than himself.  Perhaps you could start by offering to tutor someone who is struggling with Python.  You could spend time talking to an old woman, or someone with a physical disability.<p>Work on being a good person.  Once you've done that, the friends will come, and the loneliness will fix itself.<p>As a corollary to this, do an inventory of your friends, even though you don't have many, and of your family members.  Are they good people?  Or are they shallow and small minded or mean or alcoholic?  Do they talk about other people behind their backs?  Are they negative, or hypercritical?  If so, get them out of your life.  People can be heat sinks, just like a swimming pool.  You don't notice them draining your energy, in fact maybe being around them can seem pleasant.  But over time, just as an 80 degree swimming pool will suck heat energy out of your body at an alarming rate, so can negative people.<p>Which brings me to problem number two.  It sounds like your instructors and professors aren't adding anything to your life.  You must now either find professors or teachers who do add to your life, and will take an interest in you, or you need to get the fuck out of college.  It's okay to give up on formal education, especially if you have a good brain.  Learn the shit out of python from books.  Build toy applications.  Get a job.  Contribute to open source.  There is more than one way to get an education.<p>And regarding problem number three, I really like the advice by Swombat above.  You ain't alone, bubba.  Nobody cares except for you.<p>And I know this won't be popular advice, but maybe it's time you thought of a change.  I don't know that I'd recommend the Indian Army for a change of pace, but I spent 4 years in the US Army as a paratrooper between high school and college, and it helped me to get over my own bullshit.  Again, my bullshit was very similar to yours.  No friends, didn't like my instructors at college, and my family wasn't much help.<p>Whatever happens, you're not alone, and good luck.  You'd be surprised at how many people there are out there who, once they decide you're a good person, will want to see you succeed.",1288477970

Another way of explaining it could be anytime you have an economic loss with no gains elsewhere in the economy.  For example: trade quotas and tariffs create deadweight loss in a economy because they transfer value from the consumers to the producers by raising prices.<p>Also, anytime you have a market where theres a monopoly, deadweight loss will typically occur.",1288477692

Aside from all the usual stuff about not properly understanding something until you've taught it to someone else, there's something else going on, which (by crude analogy to your analogy!) is a bit like the rsync algorithm: you have a large ""bitmap"" to sync, and limited bandwidth to sync it over, so you proceed by checksumming the receiver's existing copy and trying to figure out what diffs you need to communicate to bring them up to date.<p>In practice this means that teaching is a deeply interactive activity which involves first exploring the contours of someone's existing understanding and then trying to move them to a richer understanding in the most direct way possible. Perhaps this is a more general case of what you're talking about: intuition is one thing that you can try to teach (or communicate) to another person, but maybe all you're trying to teach is something mundane and concrete like the difference between a Google account and a Google Apps account, which is less about intuition and more about having a simple but exactly correct mental model of the world in order to not be hopelessly confused by it.",1288477665

The idea that you can just make something good enough that people can't ignore it is, in fact, the view that is hopelessly naive.  It isn't like the internet where you can easily achieve massive distribution.  You have to get it in the hands of a very small number of people who are swamped by an incredibly large number of people in the exact same situation as you.<p>The amount of good content that is generated by writers is overwhelming and, in fact, incredibly easy to ignore.  Not saying you can't point to success stories of people who produced their own stuff.

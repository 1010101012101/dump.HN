I like to paint and indulge in photography and I have often seen ideas jumping from one field to the other. Like working on a project that requires front-end work sometimes gets help from while I am splashing paint on my canvas. Photography on the other hand, lets me indulge in the subject at hand. A developer is someone who developer, an idea, a vision into reality. I just do not associate ""being a developer"" to ""being a programmer"" anymore.<p>I did not like the ""work for free"" advice a lot but I do think that sometimes the only way to work on something that you really want to work on is to give your time and energy to it, for free. I am sure there are people who will not agree with me but I am a big proponent of non-profits (esp the ones who ask for your services, more than money).",1370354337

I have dabbled in the past, but I just gave up relatively quickly. Do I miss out? No. There is useful stuff there, absolutely, but what I have found is that traditional media works as a sort of filter. So, I'm a F1 fan. Lots of F1 people twitter. But, anything important and useful appears in the usual traditional places. So, I have no need what so ever to follow any one on twitter. If something important comes up, it will appear on, say, the BBC's F1 sub-site.<p>So, these days, I would suggest that twitter, facebook, etc, are like a raw feed, with traditional journalists filtering the information for me. So far, I have not ever missed out.<p>Is that what's happening in general, or is that just me?<p>Another thing I have discovered recently is that live news is misleading knee jerk stuff, that in the end doesn't really help <i>most</i> people. The latest example I can think of is the attack in London. So much info was flying about, but most of it was inaccurate and contradictory. My missus was glued to 24hr rolling news and twitter, and frankly talking nonsense, with it changing all the time. In the end, I told her to turn it all of and watch the 10 o'clock new later on, by which time a more coherent picture would have emerged. Which is pretty much what I do now. Do we really need our new instantly? Or is it better quality a few hours later?<p>I would, of course, accept that this sort of raw live information is very useful to those involved in one way or another. But most of us aren't.",1370354097

There is also a network effect in that the more features and integration points a particular platform has, the more valuable it is.<p>Salesforce has done this extremely effectively, from salesforce automation, to customer relations management, to customer service, etc. In many cases now it is virtually unimaginable not to use Salesforce, since the feature set is so extensive. One note here is that although the UI has had its warts, Salesforce is actually has a much better UI experience compared to most other enterprise apps (lightweight competitors tend to be better, but not deliver the feature set).<p>In any case, marketing is a natural extension for Salesforce at this point and I have ever reason to expect they will be successful at dominating this market segment just as they have in other sectors and points on the value chain.

I just used the Rails one as an example.<p>In the case of Cassandra, disk I/O was a constant issue.  So, we grew the cluster much larger than would be necessary on another provider.  We also lost instances pretty regularly.  If we were lucky, Amazon would notify us about degraded hardware, but usually the instance would stay up but do things like drop 20% of its packets.  Replacing a node in Cassandra is easy enough, but you quickly learn how much their I/O levels impact network performance as well.  Nowadays Cassandra has the ability to compress data to reduce network load, but you then run into EC2's fairly low CPU performance.<p>The CPU-bound application I mentioned wasn't so bad, but we paid heftily for that ($2.40 / hour - some volume discount).  At the high end the hardware tends not to be over-subscribed.<p>Performance, price, and reliability were all issues in all cases.  Those are not EC2's strong suits and haven't been for a while.",1370352859

Even as you go down the political spectrum to libertarians (short of anarcho-libertarians), you have consensus that government should at least provide security, from domestic crime and international threats, the enforcement of contracts, etc. Most people would go on to say that it's the government's job to provide at least basic education, utilities and transportation, etc, and do so with low waste and corruption. Fostering a culture of solidarity and shared values goes directly to those basic functions of government.<p>When you look at Scandinavian countries, and wonder how their systems work so well, you have to consider how shared culture and values plays a role in that success. When you wonder why the welfare state works so poorly in the U.S., you can't ignore the impact of the tremendously acrimonious culture we have, steeped in animosity between the races and between different socioeconomic classes. And if you go further down the spectrum of dysfunction, you can't help but notice the stark contrast between the extensive but relatively corruption-free governments of the Scandinavian countries and the very limited but highly corrupt governments of places like India or Bangladesh. I think that comes from a lack of solidarity. There is no motivation to, say, not take a bribe, if your mentality is that you're only in it for yourself.",1370352253

They are not the same, or rather, they should be treated differently.<p>When you consider plans and estimates as identical, two things happen.<p>First, your estimates start becoming subject to political pressure. After all, the only reason anyone starts a project is to meet some goal or goals. And those goals tend to come with certain constraints. If you work backwards from the goal, you get a plan and then suddenly, if the plan disagrees with the estimate, guess where the pressure goes?<p>Likewise, if you simply take your estimate and transform it into the plan, you've failed to plan adequately. An estimate is a probablistic statement about some future outcome. By itself it fulfills one and <i>only</i> one of the required features of a plan:<p>* Job sizing: How big is this job, and how long do you expect it to take?<p>* Job structure: How are you going to do the work? What will you do first, second and so on?<p>* Job status: How do you know where you are? Are you going to finish on time and are the costs under control?<p>* Assessment: How good was your plan? Did you make any obvious errors, what mistakes should you avoid in future, and how can you do a better job next time?<p>If the estimates <i>were actual estimates</i>, expressed in terms of uncertainty, then the ""overflow"" statement is a nonsense. In fact all such approaches are a nonsense, as they require hundreds of people to miraculously become expert forecasters in what are often novel tasks. Given how many ways people can fall into the ""planning fallacy"", that's unfair. Estimation deserves at least a structured process of its own -- whether by parametric model, points poker or PERT 3-point estimation.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a bit of a wingnut about estimation and I've been  working on a tool to make it easier and better.",1370352063

Yes the reasons for Iraq were pulled from the hat, but the nation was eager to be deluded.

5819211,comment,5817228,5819175,1,0,nirvdrum,,,"I don't entirely disagree.  All I can say is REE and Rails 2.3 were far lighter weight and faster than Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.2.  Given it's a 3.5 year old app, the landscape was pretty different back then.  I looked at Lift and didn't like it.  Django was still in a weird place.  And ultimately Rails looked like the best option for a variety of reasons.<p>Things evolve and whole hog rewrites are difficult.  Nowadays we run in JRuby and things are quite a bit better.  But we can't run on anything smaller than an m1.large.  The low I/O and meager RAM in a c1.medium preclude its use.  (BTW, that's where a lot of the original 15 came from -- with a process using 100 MB RAM and only 1.7 GB available, it's hard to squeeze much more out of that).<p>But the larger point is with virtually any other provider you can pick a configuration that matches the needs of your app (rather than the other way around), don't have to fight with CPU steal, don't have to fight with over-subscribed hardware, and don't have to deal with machine configurations from 2006.  Yeah, Rails is never going to outperform your Scala web service.

Right now on (e.g.) a Roku, the process of finding a specific show to watch consists of opening several apps: check Netflix... Not there? Check Hulu... Not there? check YouTube. Not there? check NBC.com. Not there? check other stations' content sites. Not there? Check local storage. Not there? Check NAS. All I want is something to organize this into one DVR-like list. It can start the various necessary apps for viewing (not ideal, but I understand their commercial interest to keep their properties siloed). I am just sick of having to dig through every individual source to watch what I want. Furthermore, a good application would keep tabs on release date and watched status for me, like you'd expect from a DVR.",1370351208

2087840,comment,2087247,2087789,0,0,burgerbrain,,,"I grew up with Asian parents^, and so I think I can safely say that the parenting techniques are at the very least cruel.  For example, she makes it a point very early on that she doesn't allow her children to properly socialize with their peers.  Education and socialization are <i>not</i> mutually exclusive and it is absolutely vital that you don't don't convince your children otherwise.  Then after making it a point to mention this little rule, she <i>never backs it up or defend it</i>.  Why doesn't she allow her children to participate in drama or visit with friends?  <i>We don't know</i>.  One is left to simply presume that perhaps it's because she's on a power trip, enacting some sort of revenge on her children for daring to be a burden on her life.<p>^technically my parents were quite germanic, but their parenting technique was <i>to a tee</i> what Chua described.  <i>""You got a A- in geography?!  You need to spend more time studying!""</i>  <i>""why are you listening to rock and roll music?  you should play cello like your brother!""</i>.  It's making a <i>big</i> mistake to think that this sort of <i>bad</i> parenting is limited to Asian parents.",1294646085

2087816,comment,2086937,2087385,0,0,ztan,,,"I disagree. Reason: I think the problem with Intel is that they are more of a manufacturing company than design company. What I hear from insiders (anyone at Intel care to validate/correct?) is that the company's culture as a whole value their design arm much less than their manufacturing. Their main advantage (also strategy) has always been that they can out manufacture their competition. (ie faster shrink, better yields) Intel does not have a good track record for processor design outside of the x86 CPU space. (and even in that space the P4 is pretty much a failure in terms of design) Looking at their repeated failed attempts at being significant in the graphics space. And then there is Xscale. They had a lot of potential with the StrongARM group when they acquired them from DEC, but they just ended up selling them to Marvell (who is now doing amazing stuff with them). Also how they are now capitalizing on their superior manufacturing capabilities by venturing into producing lower tech products like SSDs. Combine all of that with the notion that the x86 architecture simply does not offer any value on a mobile CPU, (another debate, but one I strongly believe) I really don't think Intel will have anything competitive against ARM ""shortly"". (Xscale was sold in 2006...)",1294644602
2087815,comment,2087367,2087367,0,0,SpacemanSpiff,,,"from the article:<p>Writing to random locations in system memory isn't generally a wise design practice. Unsurprisingly, the game would generate spectacular crashes as a result.  A human player would be driving blind and usually crash right away, limiting the scope of system casualties.  The AI opponents had no such weakness.  The computer would scan immediately in front, to the left, and to the right of its position to determine if it was about to hit a wall and change directions accordingly.  So as far as the computer was concerned, system memory looked no different than screen memory.  As Marco described it,<p><i>We can only speculate what it started doing once it left screen memory, since it obviously would look to find a way to continue going in a direction that was occupied by 0’s. If it became blocked and ran into a “wall” of numbers, it would die. In those spectacular crashes though, it would sometimes be running around very much “alive” until at some point it either overwrote some code being executed with a trail that didn’t make sense, or it would access some memory mapped device that would then cause a crash.  But it wasn’t immediate – the AI ran around for a little while out there before it crashed the system.</i><p>--

There are not two ways to treat children (hard vs soft).<p>I think Bray falls into the same trap as many of the indignant respondents on MetaFilter to Chua's piece (though in a less emotive way). There are no dichotomies when it comes to raising children or ""what's best"" for them, but people seem quick to adopt their own society's and communities' norms to judging both their own parenting techniques and those of others. Seneca was right to suggest that one should learn philosophy to grow as a human being because without such study these polarized opinions are so easy to cling to.<p>I think Chua does a reasonable job of acknowledging and describing the gulf between her supposedly traditional ""Chinese"" opinions and the ""Western"" gamut of parenting techniques without casting significant aspersions on ""Western"" parenting, at least in the essay given (I haven't read her book). When it comes to Westerners judging Chua, however, people seem very quick to paint her techniques as wrong, evil, or ""cruel"" using a moral framework that simply doesn't apply to her case - it's about as meaningful as criticizing how Amazonian tribes live (or, better, judging American politics by European standards).<p>As in everything, there's a middle way here. Bray's observations indicate, to me, that he <i>sees</i> the gooey middle  of the parenting gamut but then fails to acknowledge it.",1294643615

I've been in need of a way to store the drink recipes I've used over the years, and this seems to be a great solution.<p>Something that would really help me, and I presume chefs because there's alot of categorizing going on there, too, is the ability to tag recipes with a category.

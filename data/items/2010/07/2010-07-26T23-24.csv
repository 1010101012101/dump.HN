What do you want to accomplish?<p>Say, you want to write a new mobile app. Your desire itself will consist of rational analysis and emotional drive, the former being required to make it a sound business and the latter required to plow through to the finish line. Before you start, ask yourself - how much will this project take? one month? Let's make it three months - a good estimate for overruns. Do you have enough drive to plow through it without distraction? If the answer is a resounding, enthusiastic form-the-top-of-your-lungs yes, go right ahead - you will not be distracted because the shining beacon of the goal will pull you in the right direction.<p>If the answer came up short of ""super yes"", you need to plan a set of activities that will replenish your enthusiasm. Early user feedback works best for me (and if you can't get it your business itself is iffy). Peer encouragement is second best, if you can get it(that's a good reason to apply to YC). Quality business metrics themselves are motivating in an addictive way, just make sure to get addicted to the right metrics. Lastly, try something that your family and non-techie friend can relate to. If you keep telling everyone in your social circle what you do and they keep staring blank in return it will get to you one day, underminign your motivation. Plan ahead and don't let that happen.<p>And finally, remember back to what motivated you in the past and do more of that. When you sit right now in front of the computer reading this post you might not remember much right away, but as you spend more time thinking about ""what really gets me going"" in the coming days, things will start coming to the surface.

The example (from a trip-reminder app) was the sentence ""Do not announce these trains"". Clicking ""Do not"" changed the sentence to ""Do announce these trains 20 minutes before they depart"", clicking ""20 minutes"" allowed the user to enter a time, and clicking ""depart"" changed it to ""arrive"". All clickable text appears as hyperlinks to let the user know what can be changed. The author then demonstrated this element scaling up to what would normally require a configuration dialog of a dozen checkboxes, radio buttons, text fields, and spin boxes.

Perhaps having to do this is a sign of ADHD.  For me it was.  There are many signs and symptoms, and unfortunately many people have heard that people are over medicated on things like Ritalin and Adderral.  However, the thing to consider is that people with strong ADHD actually have a different brain structure.  It turns out that the focus benefits of being on the medication only works for people who genuinely do have ADHD, and does not work for ""regular"" people (if there even is such a thing).<p>Let me just say, that Adderral changed my life.  I used to have what I termed ""Reddit seeking behavior"".  I could work on tasks that were interesting, but if it got a little rough or boring - what's happening on Reddit, or HN or Digg?

The original thinking was that Calculus couldn't be taught to highschoolers, so you waited until University to take it. Aspiring mathematicians would take a rigorous, proof-based Caclulus course, which would prepare them to tackle harder subjects in the future.

You're addicted to something if you don't genuinely need it, but it's uncomfortable to seriously contemplate giving it up.  I <i>like</i> watching television too much, in the sense that I would prefer to like it less, but I haven't watched any in months, and this does not seem problematic.<p>I have to agree with the main thesis, though:  however you define it, things are getting more addictive.  That seems like an almost necessary consequence of capitalism.  If your product or service is addictive, you can cause much more discomfort to your customers without losing them.  Almost every way of improving the bottom line without improving the product involves causing discomfort to your customers (the only exception being ""get more customers""), and any of those things can be done at the same time as improving the product.  Just look at credit cards:  everybody hates them, their policies are extremely abusive, but people are addicted to the convenience they provide.  It's not worth giving up capitalism for (it's still the worst economic system except all the others, with posthumous apologies to Churchill).<p>I think there's perhaps a business model in managing the increasing addictiveness of the world around us.  I'm not sure where, but it's such a potential value that there must be one.",1280185721

I'm just saying that it worked well for the browser (mostly because it was forced on us, but still) and node is an experiment to try the same thing on the server.<p>It's a lot better than writing C, (which is what Ryan was doing before starting node) since JS has closures, anonymous functions and other functional niceties that make event based programming much easier.<p>The fact that you can now code your server-side code in the same language and paradigm as your client-side code is a huge bonus, but was not the reason node was created. V8 is an amazing VM and it's a language that lots of talented developers know.  Why not let them loose on the server and see what comes out of this talent.<p>Given the constraint of using JavaScript on the server, node is the best solution.  If you don't want that constraint, then maybe erlang or something with no-shared state is a better solution.",1280185623

Skype would probably be fine for the one-to-one meetings, but I'm not sure how to tackle the one-to-many (specifically, one-to-three) conference scenarios.<p>Wondering if the HN community could advise on some decent low-cost solutions. I think this organization could probably spend a couple grand on a hardware/software solution, if that would even get them anywhere. My assumption is that the remote locations have a decent internet connection and a PC as a minimum baseline.<p>Thanks,

Sometimes, we're lucky enough to receive correct information or things that don't harm us. Trusting an expert is a good idea as you say, but trusting an expert whose opinion has been normalized by an institution is quite dangerous. It's less dangerous if you fully understand the motives of the institution, but with today's treacherous institutions, even most people in the institution are unaware of the motives and their consequences.",1280185556

What does it mean to say it is <i>bad</i>?<p>pg is taking great pains to distance himself from <i>real</i> addiction, like crystal meth.  Yet he never explicitly explains anywhere why the new ""addiction"" is actually <i>bad</i>, other than trying to loosely associate it with alcohol.  I don't think that the ""addictiveness"" of a thing <i>alone</i> is enough to call it bad.  I'm way more addicted to air than a meth addict is addicted to his fix, and I don't consider air addiction a disability.<p>Now perhaps he's right and it really is bad--but I think this is a fundamental assumption that needs to be discussed and argued, not swallowed whole.<p>* Is it <i>morally</i> bad?<p>* Is it <i>dangerous</i>?<p>* Can the claims of loss of productivity be scientifically substantiated?  To what extent?<p>* To what extent is the comparison to alcohol valid?  Is it mood-altering?  Does it significantly affect decisionmaking?<p>I think these are important questions that we have somehow skipped in this discussion.<p>My personal take is that we simply have a lot more free time now than we did 50 or 100 years ago, where we needed to spend more time feeding and clothing ourselves, and so Farmville arises to fill the empty space.  Could this be redirected into something productive?  Maybe?  But people also burn out and have inefficiencies, so I'm not sure you could extract much more productivity unless we returned to hand-to-mouth.",1280185215

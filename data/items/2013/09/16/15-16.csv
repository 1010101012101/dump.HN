I think he may be alone among &quot;well-known&quot; cryptographers in his distrust for ECC, which goes back over a decade.<p>Second, the CurveCP &quot;constants&quot; aren&#x27;t NIST derived; they&#x27;re Bernstein&#x27;s Curve25519, which is derived transparently from first-principles math.<p>Third, there are standardized NIST curves (over binary fields) that are <i>also</i> derived transparently from first-principles.<p>Fourth, the curves that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> totally transparent are still derived from a SHA hash of random string, per the method in IEEE 1363 (which in 1363&#x27;s context makes perfect sense, since you can&#x27;t really generate &quot;fresh&quot; curves for applications from first principles without everyone ending up with the same curves). The backdoor scenarios here are... convoluted.<p>The more you learn about the situation with NIST ECC, the less likely an overt backdoor seems.

The closer something is to engineering doctrine, the closer it is to systems administration.  If company A wants a Linux VM with Apache and some static pages, there is some per-customer work versus company B, but it is very easily estimated.

I&#x27;ve had a huge USD withdrawal from Mtgox pending for over 7+ weeks now (8 weeks on 21st September).<p>Every single time I email them asking how much longer it&#x27;s going to take they just get back to me saying &quot;We don&#x27;t know, a few more weeks.&quot; It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating! They always offer to cancel my withdrawal and credit the funds back to my Gox account (so I can buy BTC at their inflated rates ? Nu-uh!).<p>Another offer they made me after a lot of back and forth was a 5% fee on my withdrawal (for a 7 day turn around time). That is ABSOLUTELY insane. Imagine a $100k withdrawal - you&#x27;d be paying $5,000 as fees on that. OUCH!<p>So here I am (along with possibly tons of other bitcoin users) with my money stuck in Gox. I already started using other trading platforms but I have to somehow retrieve this cash... Maybe I&#x27;ll just take a hit and convert back to bitcoin and move my BTC out ? I don&#x27;t know.. there&#x27;s about a 10% price difference between Gox and other exchanges. So I&#x27;d lose 10% if I were to convert back to Bitcoin now, sell them on another exchange and cash out there.<p>Gox has lost a LOT of customers because of their behavior so far.. it&#x27;s only a matter of time before they lose all of them.",1379347046

The TLDR version by someone who&#x27;s looked into it a bit but not actually used it:<p>* Storage, Transactions, and Querying are separated as in different processes/machines separated.<p>* Data is immutable. Storage is pluggable and has implementations on top of Dynamo/Riak.<p>* Transaction semantics and ordering are controlled by a single process for consistency. This is the write scaling caveat. It&#x27;s less of a restriction than it sounds (if you&#x27;re thinking SQLite2 like I did) because there aren&#x27;t writes/queries competing for resources, it&#x27;s just the sequencing.<p>* Queries on the db are performed in-client and can interoperate with client code and state. When you write a query, datomic pulls the data from storage to the local machine and performs the query.<p>* Queries are in a logic programming language called datalog.

So pretty much if you can imagine it as an addressing mode, the PDP-11 could do it, so thats explains the weird compatibility between something that looks like C and something that can define the hardware of a CPU.  Its not a perfect analogy but it kind of describes why the HDL look very C like rather than Ruby like, for example.  If you could build it out of basic logic gates in 1970 using TTL chips, its probably supported by the old PDP-11 and therefore in C.<p>Finally you need a FAQ for old timers that home-scale FPGA / CPLD stuff has collapsed in price over the last decade or two.  Yes, in 1990 you needed four figures to do anything so no one did anything at home.  Now you need at minimum a $50 board and a (multi-gig) free download.  Its maybe 3dB more expensive than fooling around with arduino stuff.  The small scale stuff doesn&#x27;t scale well to larger stuff; I think its &quot;weird&quot; when a simple gray code decoder or quadrature decoder takes a minute to synth, so yes doing a complete CPU does take a long time to synth even on fairly high end hardware.

New Zealand is not that much bigger than the US Eastern Seaboard metro area, which extends from Washington DC to Boston. If you extend that a bit further, from Virginia Beach VA to Portland ME, and extended it inland about as wide as New Jersey for the whole stretch, that&#x27;s a pretty good match.<p>A NYC-density city that large would be interesting. It would need rapid mass transit throughout with high-speed lines connecting with local hubs. That would be doable if you&#x27;re rebuilding the entire area. (Amtrak hasn&#x27;t been able to build high speed rail because they&#x27;re stuck using the existing railways which aren&#x27;t straight enough.) Presumably a lot of traffic could be reduced by replacing all of the highways with mass transit, which would be feasible if the whole area was that densely populated. Again, it hasn&#x27;t been done now because all public transit around the big cities is designed to get you into and out of the cities; if your destination is anyplace else you have to drive yourself. It&#x27;s much better within NYC where public transit goes everywhere.<p>NYC, dense as it is, still has lots of open parkland. I think it would be quite livable even at the scale we&#x27;re talking about. Of course people would still need to be able to get out of the city for a break; I imagine the whole western edge of the giant city would be public nature reserves with plenty of mass-transit access.<p>Of course not everyone would live within the city; there would need to be farms and farmers to feed everyone. Most of the US and southern portions of Canada would be farmland (much as it is today, in fact) and there would be plantations scattered around the rest of the world too wherever the weather is suited to various crops. Much of the world would still be left to nature, I think. If we&#x27;re at the point technologically and socially where we can move nearly everyone into a megacity, we should also be able to create very high efficiency hydroponic farms that could produce many crops much more densely than a standard farm can. Large areas would only be needed for animals and crops that can&#x27;t be grown hydroponically.<p>We&#x27;d need power too... lots of it. Keeping everyone in a relatively small area would help, but I&#x27;ll bet the average power usage per-person across the globe is less than the average usage per New Yorker today, and in the megacity everyone would be moved to the New Yorker level. Maybe all of the unfarmable areas in Canada can be filled up with Nuclear powerplants.",1379344765

I ran a legacy PHP commerce package for a client and it would log gigabytes of data due to deprecation warnings, I wasn&#x27;t as knowledgeable about downgrading and freezing packages as I am now, but Linode handled it fine. I think they&#x27;re 10k RPM SAS drives, so they&#x27;re quite fast.<p>On the other hand, Linode gives you access to 8x Xen CPUs from the base package. While to get the same out of DigitalOcean you need to pay $160/mo. The pros/cons I see are:<p>DigitalOcean: SSD, RAM (2x), and therefore price (for low CPU apps)\nLinode: CPU, HD space, transfer (2-4x)",1379343720

They&#x27;re all C in the back-end. It&#x27;s just pointers and more pointers at the lowest level.<p>It&#x27;s not about making a toy GC, it&#x27;s about making a top-rate GC that works and packaging it up as a tool.",1379343715

Problems that people have with interviewing on the phone are not that they can&#x27;t hear the question that&#x27;s being asked. They mostly stem from the fact that interaction space with the interviewer is so much more limited.<p>Your service does not simulate a phone interview -- there&#x27;s no ability for your automated service to interpret and judge responses and to provide feedback.<p>I suggest you pivot into setting up mock interviews between developers. They can interview each other getting valuable practice and then rate each other on interview skills on both sides of the fence; your value is in\n- setting up developers with each other and tracking their info/scores if they do more than one interview\n- providing interview scripts and questions to guide them",1379343629

You don't go there to appeal your case, you go there to appeal specific decisions and interpretations of the law.<p>IMO, from a lawyers vantage point, what is the difference between a patent covering a software method (like encoding music) and a medical procedure? There really isn't any. Both are equally offensive to the folks who practice in these fields -- I have yet to meet a programmer in favor of software patents, and I'm sure doctors will feel the same way.<p>The problem is that the law as written is that software patents ARE ok.

It is said that an airliner inbound to New York in the 1950s lost all its gyroscopes in heavy weather over Block Island. The captain was a wise old man who had risen with the airlines from the earliest airmail days and was approaching retirement. A lesser pilot might have fallen for the trap of intuition. But the captain simply took out his pocket watch, dangled it from its chain, and began to swing it toward the instrument panel. Flying by the pendulum and the compass, he proceeded the length of Long Island in the clouds. After breaking into the clear near the airport, he landed and wished his passengers a good day.<p>(the entire article is really worth reading: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/langew/turn.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/langew/turn.htm</a>)<p>But in this case the pilots didn't even need to do that. Their gyros were working correctly, so they had an artificial horizon right in front of them. The attitude of the plane was known. They even recovered their airspeed indicator after 30s (the second one after a minute)! All that was needed was for the pilot to stop pulling on the stick",1323352682

The articificial horizon works on this same principle, but pilots are known to ignore it anyway.

The difference about this new email system, is we're sending personalized emails to each subscriber, containing  only the deals they want to see (we're not a yipit clone, or an aggregator, we run exclusive daily deals in different categories, users can now select which types of deals they wish to receive).<p>I'm not an amazing programmer, but I'm the lead on this site. Our generation of what to send and where to send it is fine (creating campaigns on the fly, queuing up emails to be sent) the issue arises when sending via SendGrid, currently, we're running a script that opens an SMTP connection to Send Grid, sends a batch of 100 emails (the sendgrid max per connection) and closes the SMTP connection (and repeat). This is pretty slow. We're at about 17 secs to generate and send the 100 email batch, I'm going to do some code optimization on the email generation, which will hopefully speed things up. I'm just wondering if anyone here knows of a good way to speed up our delivery. - As I mentioned, I'm an intermediate coder, what I've built thus far is in PHP/MySQL.",1323352270

That's a big accomplishment.<p>However, you're at a point in your business's life where things might get dicey. I think you'll find that the business grows slower than you might hope, and no amount of coding will change that. For bootstrappers, it's just the way it goes. You're not going to spend $10,000 on ads, so you just have to do things the slow way (talking to bloggers, writing articles, posting on forums, etc, etc).<p>Your business will still require a lot of work from you, but at this stage it also requires time overall for people to hear about it, find it, leave, and come back later when they hear about it again. You have to give it time to grow and that means providing yourself with income. Maybe think about getting a job or doing freelancing. I know you said jobs require too much mental energy, but once the MVP is launched, you can dial back on the coding. You have to dial up the selling, but I've found this to be possible in parallel with a normal job, especially if selling doesn't involve phone calls and is just you emailing bloggers.<p>Anyways, I'm sure you'll find your way.

I suspect that when it does become true, computers will look a lot more like animal brains than the computers of today, or maybe they will look like something completely different from either.<p>><i>This was informed by arguments in ai. See for example, jurgen schmidhuber's website, or genetic programming at john koza's website.</i><p>After a <i>very</i> cursory look, it appears that Dr. Koza has a very pragmatic attitude about genetic algorithms and is well aware of their limitations, and thus choses to focus his efforts on areas where they are most applicable.  On the other hand, Dr. Schmidhuber seems to have staked his legacy on the idea that computers will soon be able to solve absolutely any problem better than humans can, and is passionately trying to spread this vision.  He may very well be proven correct in the end, but I tend to be deeply skeptical of predictions made by such visionaries.<p>><i>I agree, many problems are in a sense ""easy"", and human's can solve them.</i><p>Some problems that are easy for humans are hard for computers, and some problems that are easy for computers are hard for humans.  I assume that's why you put ""easy"" in quotes: problems that are ""easy"" for humans.<p>><i>However, my belief is that those are the problems that have already been solved. The difficult problems, the ones that have not yet been solved, might well be too difficult for humans to comprehend.</i><p>We may very well eventually reach a point where we truly have solved all of the problems within our capacity as humans, but that day is so far off that everyone alive today will be ancient history by then.  Often, solving one problem reveals several more interesting problems that we hadn't even considered before.<p>><i>Computation is cheap enough now that it should be the default first step to try to brute force a solution.</i><p>This may be true for some classes of problems, but it is still not true for many, and will never be true for some.  Consider cryptography: ""brute force"" only works if you have considerably more computation power than the computer(s) used to perform the encryption in the first place.  However, if you can find a flaw in the encrption scheme to exploit, you might even be able to get by with <i>less</i> computation power.<p>><i>Even in high school, teach students how to describe problems as an optimization. Don't bother teaching them equation solving. Analytical solutions are sometimes needed, let that be a specialization for advanced undergraduates or even graduate school.</i><p>This would be a very, very bad idea.  In order to use a tool like machine learning properly, you need a solid understanding of the problems you are trying to solve, so that you can frame them properly for the machine.  Furthermore, there are many pragmatic real-world problems that require analytical solutions, much more than could be addressed by a small body of specialists.  I think that basic programming concepts like iteration and recursion <i>should</i> be taught in secondary school (possibly even primary school), and I could definitely see adding basic concepts of optimization to that curriculum, but analytical thinking is so critical that taking it out would be an enormous mistake.",1323351660

Manipulating arrays to get just the SQL you want is sometimes annoying, but for the queries that you honestly can't get out of the ORM in CakePHP, it's also likely you wouldn't be able to do the same in any other ORM.<p>You'll also have to note that both frameworks have progressed significantly in the last few years - CakePHP actually just released a new major version, as did Rails a few months ago - so your experience a few years ago - was this in the 1.1 era - would just be indicative of the framework's beginnings, not where it currently is.<p>Feel free to message me with your thoughts if they still conflict; I'd love to hear the other side of the story since improving CakePHP as a framework helps not just my ego, but other developers who are using CakePHP to make a living :)",1323351032

Ive long since given up trying to maintain my Circles, and Im pretty sure Im not alone. Circles also lost its core utility for me. After I put about 100 people into different buckets I couldnt remember who I put where, and what I was supposed to share with which Circle. So I just gave up and started sharing everything publicly.<p>> It doesnt matter how great and fun an experience is, good UI design cannot fix a broken solution.<p>I actually think Google Circles' problem <i>is</i> poor UI design, not a broken solution. Lists are a great way to manage things, but you need to have powerful operations on top of lists. I said it when they came out that I was disappointed with their lack of a Venn-diagram interface where I can define sets of people in terms of other sets and their operations. (Why then ""circles"" and not ""groups""?) On-the-fly one-time-use circles would have been nice to have, too. And they didn't have an API for a long time so it's not like someone could straightforwardly go implement such things in a third-party app. (I haven't been following the API so I don't know if someone could do this now, but I'm pretty sure their first version of the API didn't even allow POST requests--awful developer UI.)<p>On a second note, I think good UI can cover up a broken solution.

A lot of big contracts require companies to have registered engineers, who in turn force their software engineers to register. Once you register you automatically owe them 65 dollars a year from the date you graduated, or a max of 325 dollars for all the previous years, and then 65 a year for every year after that. If you consider how many engineers are walking around, thats a shit load of money ana great con frankly.

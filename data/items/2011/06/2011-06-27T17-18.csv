For me, the biggest problem has been that OnSwipe makes no attempt to handle URLs correctly.  URLs from the desktop version redirect to the TOC on iPad.  When you visit articles on the iPad, the URL bar is not updated, so you can't even bookmark or share what you're looking at.  Once they get this right, I think a lot of the grief expressed on HN will fade away.",1309197595

Firefox has been trying to move in this direction since the introduction of the horribly named AwesomeBar, which was intended to be a DWIM button for Web navigation.<p>The conspiracy theory doesn't really hold up, since as far as I can tell, pleasing Google doesn't affect Mozilla's bottom line either way. The value of Google's <i>happiness</i> to Mozilla is substantially less than $9 million per year. The important metric isn't happiness  it's the binary ""Have we avoided pissing Google off so badly that they're willing call off the deal and give up all those Firefox ad clicks to Bing?""<p>To go beyond the call of duty and actually try to make Google <i>happy</i> by making Firefox worse would be a stupid move  it would only weaken Mozilla's bargaining position with Google.",1309197572
2702265,comment,2700791,2701995,1,0,Klinky,,,"...again, I am not saying Virgin is inherently evil. The original post suggested that an employee on strike might go to Branson thinking he is a friend and not part of the ""evil company"". My point was that Richard Branson is the founder & the president of the company & has sided with management already in his open letter. That is what I meant by ""he is the 'evil company'"". I would hold little hope that a pilot is going to have much sway with Mr. Branson.<p>Now the conversation has veered off into if Branson is a friend of his employees. It sounds like he's partied with employees during the good times. But it's physically impossible for him to be a true personal friend with all his employees. While it's good to be on friendly terms with the founder/president/executive team, you must always keep in mind their position of power & what their motivations might be.<p>Good companies probably do layoff people. But there is this concept that if you fire someone on a friday it's better for them, or right before their weekend or you give a bunch of employees free travel bonuses while sacking 7% of them. It's slight of hand.",1309197555

If Kleenex had an active patent on tissues, I wouldn't be able to make and market tissues without infringing on their patent.<p>That's a substantial difference.

I emailed (CopWatch) a few weeks ago and have not heard anything.  One of my suggestions was to change the name.<p>I know of a person in which a novelty iPhone scale app was used as probable cause to search their vehicle.  He is a developer who wanted to see how an iPhone app could act as a scale.  Our estimations were correct, vibration and position are used to make a very crude estimate.<p>The mere existence of this app angered the police and allowed them to justify a full vehicle search, yielding nothing.<p>A name like CopWatch is a red flag, and I would not want to have an app of that name on my phone if recording secrecy was my end goal.<p>The app does not upload in real time, but rather works like any other built in app, recording locally, uploading at user instruction, plus needing data entry prior to uploading.  Given that we have all seen video of officers destroying recording devices, or recording devices returned broken, it is important to protect that function.<p>This app in curent form offers no protection against corruption in law enforcement.<p>My best recommendation is to use UStream.  It records locally if there is no cellular or wifi connection.  If a data connection can be found, it records directly to the remote servers.  You can delete the local file, and even the local representation of the remote server file, but the master will be retained when you login to the webapp.  You must only protect your login and password to the webapp, and all recordings made while connected through a data connection should be safe for a sufficient period of time.<p>I should note, the above suggestions are only tested on iOS devices.  I have no idea if they hold true on other mobile platforms.  The UStream deletion of local files while retaining remote files could also be a bug, albeit one that has been there for over a year now.",1309196288

Pilots cannot switch airlines without starting at the very bottom.  They cannot leave the airline they are with!  If they do, they will go from $100-$150K to $30K.<p>Pilots are not promoted based on how good they are, they are promoted by seniority which means that if a pilot is a captain with Virgin and they switch to whoever is hiring now, they will never make their previous salary for the rest of their career.<p>There is a second piece of airline economics that is EXTREMELY important.  If the pilots strike, the losses an airline would take while trying to replace them will easily bankrupt any airline.  The fixed costs, long training time and lack of trained pilots in the market makes a strike an airline killer.<p>When you combine these two factors, you would normally say that both management and pilots are both in really bad positions to negotiate and MUST come to an agreement or they will both loose badly.  But, the reality is that pilots loose far worse than management  
Why? Well, management can take their skills to a different company whereas pilots cannot transfer their skills for the same money.  This puts the negotiation power directly in management hands, with one exception  Richard Branson.<p>He is getting involved and trying to get everyone together because he knows that if the pilots strike, management cannot afford their demands and the airline will be bankrupt.  If this occurs, he takes a capital loss which will suck, but the real blow is to his ego and the Virgin brand.  No other airline management is in this position.<p>A lot of airlines will be facing strikes over the next few years, great management will bridge the gaps, talk to both sides and keep the airlines running.  Terrible management will allow them to fail and move on to the next company.",1309196237

IIRC, the critical change was that a major investment firm successfully lobbied regulators to allow them to give investors the option of indefinitely rolling over their commodities investments for a small fee. Investment firms are making a ton of money on the rollovers, and investors are simply purchasing commodities orders at whatever price they're available for and sitting on them until the market prices raise enough for them to feel like selling the orders.<p>So, I could buy a pile of grain or a truckload of oil or what-have-you, not on the expectation that I'll be able to sell it for more money 6 months from now, but on the expectation that I can sit on it until I <i>can</i> sell it for more money. Basically, it gives me a place to stash money, that's guaranteed to pay me back at whatever rate I feel like demanding.<p>The downside for everyone else is that this is creating artificial scarcities in markets across the board. There's a glut of oil in storage right now that isn't being refined into gasoline or other products just because investors somewhere are waiting for the price to go up before they let go of it.<p>When you look at the peculiar way that so many commodities prices have risen so quickly in recent years, and at the way that other more traditional markets have been recovering more sluggishly than people are expecting, and at the way that the real estate market has been staying in gutter, this theory starts to make a lot of sense.

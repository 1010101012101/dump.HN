In that case, he can fight for every point because he has 1000 units of energy, everyone else has 500, and, well, there you have it...he can fight for the ""pointless"" points.<p>But let me suggest that outclassing your opponents to such a degree in the real world is far less likely. In golf, for instance, Tiger Woods' early career exploited his far superior drive. As golfers altered their game / exercise approach, Tiger upped his game elsewhere to stay on top. Similarly, if Nadal faces an opponent with equal stamina, I think you'd see a far more strategic game. Or, to phrase it differently: the strategy he employs now (strategic use of endurance) will continue, but become more apparent as he is forced to make tradeoffs. That is, he currently 'picks his battles', but his superior reserves means he can pick each point. Against someone more equally classed, he'll continue to 'pick his battles', but more equal reserves mean we'd see different effects.",1233935478

469835,comment,469320,469622,0,0,unalone,,,"Here's the problem: how do you define student performance? Are we going based on grades? Because that leads to a system that's easily gamed without significant results. I was a B-and-C student in high school because I thought a lot of the stuff I was learning was crap. In the classes I <i>did</i> like, I'd deliberately take risks with what I did and that kept my grade from staying an A+. Is that a failure? The best teachers I had very often didn't give me As, because they were the teachers I'd really strain myself for - and for me, straining was trying to solve answers in a <i>unique</i> way rather than churning out generic A crap.<p>The other option is that you monitor students for <i>achievement</i>. Again, it's hard. Is that based on money? Personal student happiness? Again, depending on what the metric is, teachers will game it. Go for money and English teachers will start encouraging students to do something more worthwhile than write and study English for a living. If you make it ""how many students get a college degree"" then you're diluting the college pool further and you're neglecting students who're interested in vocational school and in working on their own rather than continuing education.<p>The best solution is to <i>remove</i> metric and go by the opinions of experienced people. Good administrators know good teachers when they see them. Good teachers always go by their own formula. If the system effectively <i>removes</i> restriction amongst teachers, then you'll see an increase in student performance, and suddenly paying teachers more is worth it. The problem is that teaching is an act of creativity; it's an art as much as anything is. Formula kills teaching. The minute you make something mandatory it's dead to kids. The problem is, formula feels safer, but it never works.",1233934900

In other words, that killing an animal capable of experiencing terror and pain is wrong in the same way that killing a human being is wrong (though perhaps different in degree, or not).  There are other people who, while willing to eat meat, find the conditions that animals live in before they are killed deplorable and would prefer to eat the flesh of an animal that at least gets to experience a more dignified existence before its death.<p>Now, because the first group advocates a more restrictive standard and takes issue with the second groups willingness to eat meat, is the first group responsible for undue suffering of animals because they fail to acknowledge the reality that people will continue to eat meat?<p>Yes, this analogy is very inexact in comparison to the positions of monogamy vs. condom use in preventing AIDS.  But the general principle is that someone advocating a higher standard is not responsible for others failing to live up to a lesser standard.  So, if the Catholic Church advocates monogamy, that does not make them responsible for people not at least using condoms failing that.

So what might be entered as ""John Doe"" one day, might be ""J Doe"" or ""Doe John"" some other days. This is called ""patient matching"" and has been an area of interest for several decades. One paper discussing it is: \n<a href=""http://www.cecs.csulb.edu/~monge/research/thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cecs.csulb.edu/~monge/research/thesis.pdf</a><p>Most researchers in similar areas ended up getting lured into ""bioinformatics"" for the Human Genome Project. More prestige, more money and gene matching is suprisingly similar to string matching.<p>Sadly, most of the research in the area of patient matching ""went dark"" after 911. By ""going dark"" I mean a combination of researchers who used to publish, now no longer do; and companies that used to publish even white papers have disappeared from the market. One such was NORA from SRD. IBM ended up buying the company, and shortly afterwards, all web pages, white papers and even the whole website of SRD vanished (even from archive.org). \n<a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/103692/tracking_terrorists_the_las_vegas_way.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/103692/tracking_terrorists_th...</a> \n<a href=""http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/jeff_jonas/2006/02/what_do_you_kno.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/jeff_jonas/2006/02/what_do_you_...</a>",1233933944

Your statement assumes that it is outright wrong to have sex before you're married, when in reality there is nothing wrong with it other than the false construct that some people of the world have chosen to follow.<p>So assuming that it is perfectly natural to desire sex from the time that you are sexually mature (way before most people get married), which most likely relates back to our natural instincts of both pleasure and survival, why should you admonish someone for simply acting on it?<p>A catholic telling the world that they must wait for marriage before having sex is just as ridiculous as someone of the islam faith telling the world that they can't drink alcohol. Both are personal beliefs that are nothing more than constructs of the faith that they chose. If everyone in the world followed both of those rules strictly, a lot of problems would disappear... but that is unreasonable to ask, and arguably unjustifiable. So the question becomes, if people are going to have sex, how can we minimize the problems associated with this perfectly natural and desirous act? One of the cheapest solutions is condoms, which the church has publicly come out against... and as a result, they've had a directly negative impact on the STD transfer rate in Africa (and the world in general).",1233933749

The problem with Catholicism and Christianity in general is that it has coexisted with western science for hundreds of years.  There isn't much left to share on either side.

7408942,comment,7407796,7408405,5,0,205guy,,,"The buzz from the wine is wearing off, and I remembered that I do think the AirBnB model (but not modus operandi) has 2 legitimate purposes: 1) occasional subletting during occupant absence and 2) satisfying temporary demand.<p>Case 1) is essentially making vacation home exchange totally fungible. By definition (at least for most people), a vacation is infrequent and has significant cost, in part due to paying for 2 dwellings concurrently (the vacant home, and the vacation accommodation). AirBnB solves this by having a large market of people who may want to pay you for your empty home.<p>Examples of case 2) would be huge conventions and university graduations. These are cases where it would be inefficient to build hotels to satisfy peak demand, and sometimes it becomes impossible to find (conventional) lodging at any price. AirBnB solves this by providing elasticity in the form of non-conventional lodging only available during the peak.<p>In both cases, the difference with the current situation is that these cases are limited in time. I think AirBnB would be a good thing if it limited the rental of any property to a maximum of 1 month per year, with a limit of 4 guests per year. That would eliminate people running residential businesses, which is my main objection (and probably the company&#x27;s whole profit and growth strategy). In other words, AirBnB would be a great but small niche player.",1394966449

7408940,comment,7407018,7407249,7,0,bostik,,,"I was contacted right after the Elopcalypse, when all Nokia engineers and subcontractors were fair game and easy pickings.<p>Had one recruiter phone screen with some easy questions, a technical phone interview and then was informed they decided to skip the second phone interview. Got called on-site in Dublin directly instead.<p>My experience from there pretty much resembles what the author describes. First interview was about my knowledge of C, memory mappings and the related security implications. Let&#x27;s just say that it helped I had experience from both little-endian and big-endian architectures. The second one was the fairly well known python interview. The problem is devious but <i>really</i> interesting. I botched that one, because I failed to follow my instinct and sketch a visualisation out first. That caused my attempts to derail pretty badly and by the time I realised I would need to rethink and simplify much of the logic, we were out of time.<p>Third one was a fascinating trouble-shooting problem. It was not just about the technical problem or the symptoms, but also about how to deal with people who may have these kinds of problems due to being frightfully clever at getting themselves set up with the problems in the first place. I think I nailed that one. We had a nice chat about the history of the problem with the interviewer because we had some time to spare.<p>Fourth one was a system design problem, and it was a true pleasure. The interviewer wasn&#x27;t as much asking me questions, as he was more laying out the problem and the proposed architecture. We went through the requirements, limitations and he even showed me one neat trick which I hadn&#x27;t ever thought before. (The actual architecture in question was effectively a DHT with an interesting twist. I thought it was brilliant.)<p>The fifth one was basically about how well I understood the system internals of unix and linux. However, the approach chosen was not the off-the-shelf one I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere - the dive into internals <i>started</i> with task_struct. Yes, the one which nobody is supposed to understand completely. (At least according to Robert Love in Linux Kernel Development.) I got it right, evevntually.<p>I was, of course, rejected due to &quot;not good enough at coding&quot;. I don&#x27;t hold that against the interviewers or the process. I know I&#x27;m a slow starter with any code - and I seem to suck at whiteboard coding. Whiteboard is great for doing visualisations and writing down short snippets where they are relevant, but for actual programming it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. My most important design tools to this day are a large paper pad and a good pencil. After that it comes down to debug logs...<p>What may sound strange, is that the on-site day remains one of the most enjoyable experiences of my life. The interviews were designed to keep my brain spinning at overdrive, and the interviewers themselves were good enough not to actively mislead (they did keep me asking questions and stating the reasons for my approaches, which was crucial). Loved it.<p>I&#x27;ve told all this to my hacker-type friends and still remain convinced that any engineer worth his title should experience the Google on-site day. It&#x27;s a challenging, but also extremely satisfying experience. Some of them have tried, and at least one has been actively courted. I&#x27;m convinced he would ace the interviews without a hitch. The requirement to move is the one thing keeping him away.",1394966404

I don&#x27;t think that yf was asking for permission to say this him[almost certainly]-self. But was demonstrating that as long as men in power think these thoughts, but can&#x27;t express them, the grey-zone and its associated problems will exist.<p>The blog post introduces the issue, and yf demonstrates it (all the more by causing so many HNers to bristle at his comment).<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily saying that men in power should start blurting these thoughts out, and they would run great personal risk at doing so. But the situation of the unexpressed existence of these thoughts, perversely hurts women of potential power much, much more than it hurts the men with the thoughts.<p>I think political correctness is the Nash equilibrium in most remotely similar situations, but that leaves the problems presented in the post, and so... Ultimately, I think that dismissing the hypothetical thoughts-cum-pronouncements as &quot;unacceptable&quot; is counterproductive with regards to lowering the barriers to power for women insofar as we are willing to accept the thesis of the original blog post[2].<p>OK, now to backtrack a little... I&#x27;m not saying that they are acceptable, but I read the hypothetical comments as intentionally built to be considered unacceptable. Under that reading, it&#x27;s not particularly productive to give them that label and then call it a day. They were, in a way, the unspoken background to the blog post made explicit in a feather-ruffling HN comment, and uncomfortable as it is to consider, putting their existence out there makes it possible to push the conversation forward. But not if we just shame such untoward behavior out of hand. Doing that promotes the status quo. We all get to feel good about ourselves, that we&#x27;re publicly fighting for the cause, but ultimately nothing gets resolved.<p>Sorry, I know that that reads as a personal attack. That is not the spirit in which I mean the comment. I think that the urge to suppress or ignore uncomfortable truths is one of the feedback loops that makes discussions on this topic so virulent. It&#x27;s not meant to be directed at the person that conducts the SolarNet account, but at us all, the community that struggles with the difficult subject of inequity among us. It often feels better to jump to the defense of honor or decorum than to really dig into the ugly truths behind the issues that cause us harm. But when we follow that instinct, we often leave the infection there under the surface to fester. I think that this particular issue is tricky and damaging enough to the community to warrant some leeway on decorum when discussing it.<p>In the interest of commiseration, I&#x27;ll admit that I found that I bristled at the comment as well. I&#x27;m not endorsing it, but I think that if looked at in the right light, it is a very useful comment. Really, it does nobody any good to try to shame yf (and honestly, judging by this comment alone, I&#x27;m not sure that yf is easily shamed).

As soon as some subject becomes taboo to discuss people lose the understanding why something is bad and start to treat everything related as bad and unacceptable. Reminds me of this: <a href=""http://i.snag.gy/kdu77.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.snag.gy/kdu77.jpg</a>  (doesn&#x27;t matter if experiment was real or not). This is very prominent with sexism and racism—these words are losing the meaning really fast. Now merely acknowledging someones race is called racism. Same goes for gender. And god forbid you find someone attractive. I really don&#x27;t get what kind of society these people want. The one where everybody walks covered in burqas?\nYou are not allowed to look at attractive person—you will offend them. I wonder how soon a simple glance will accepted as a kind of sexual assault.\nYou are not allowed to approach the person you like—it will be &quot;unwanted advances&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t&quot; situation. If woman will say that it makes her feel good when she senses attention she will be explained, that&#x27;s just because patriarchal society made her to feel this way. More often than not those explaining will be males, ironically. What a terrible society to live, luckily it will die out soon for the lack of reproduction.<p>As for this story: it has nothing to do with sexism. Nothing at all. Actually the real sexists are the ones who think all this happened because of the sexism.\nGuys (and girls): these issues are much much more complex and deserve to be treated with much more respect instead of rubber stamping like it is common now. Women and non-white people can be assholes too and I would like to retain the right call them as such without being accused of sexism or racism.\nThough this right might be long gone. \nQuite often it is a fun mental experiment to reverse the genders or races and think how vastly different reactions would be (if there would be any). Imagine that black person says: &quot;I am proud to be black!&quot;. Now imagine that the white person says &quot;I am proud to be white&quot;. Now throw away you knee-jercky reaction and think about it.",1394964867

If you cite the 20% number I know you have no interest in understanding the issue, because that number is a comparison across all jobs, and it ignores education, part time, everything. You don&#x27;t have women and men working in the same company with 20% difference in wages (at least not significantly many - of course such things happen, but also with men vs men).<p>The 20% number definitely is not from the tech industry either.<p>So you have women picking different jobs. You have different incentives and preferences (motherhood is the big one here), different preferred industry (like media vs mining or whatever).<p>You also have women getting half of the income of their husbands, having the option to drop out of unpleasant jobs, not being under the same pressure to feed their family, and so on.<p>There are many many aspects to this. So far I haven&#x27;t seen anything that convinces me women are being treated unfairly.<p>There are issues, but only if you consider staying at home with kids degrading. For example I suppose the incentive to get a good education is less if you know you will miss out several years where you could earn back the money invested.

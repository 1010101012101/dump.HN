The current democratic leadership is full of double-talkers and the republicans are completely owned by special interests.<p>The only way to get something done would be to throw more money at lobbyists than content and pharma.  But that is not likely as in Pharma&#x27;s case the current system is what keeps them in business. Gov&#x27;t pays for research, pharma picks it up, hides the flaws, markets it to the public then heavily markets against themselves when their patents expire.

You?<p>When I look at how many bands are out there slaving away to write new music, then touring, and/or making albums it doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as out of proportion. How many bands with finished albums have you <i>never</i> heard of? Compare with how many finished, polished games you&#x27;ve never even seen on Steam.<p>There might be a lot of games on Steam now compared to historical norms, but it&#x27;s a tiny fraction of what you&#x27;d see with new books, new albums, or even new independent films.<p>The market for game-type entertainment is huge, and if people have an astonishing level of choice when it comes to how to spend their time, so much the better. We don&#x27;t need indie games to hit the $100MM mark to be considered successful. Many developers would be happy if their game pulled down $10K.<p>We&#x27;re used to games where you&#x27;d have to invest $50 and want dozens of hours of gameplay for it to be worthwhile. Now things are to the point where a $1 game only has to amuse you for a few hours and it&#x27;s paid for itself.<p>The biggest problem in the indie game space is not the number of developers, but discoverability. The structure of stores, the methods used to promote them, they&#x27;re all relics of when there was a handful of games that would get released any given month. These need to change to support a broader, more rich environment where you might have hundreds of them.",1400716584

Cons: 35k debt and \\not a CS major. Information Science. I can try to switch, but I&#x27;m  assuming the worst case scenario.<p>Michigan CS Pros: Engineering powerhouse+Prestige, lots of  research, great recruiting. Would get CS degree+math minor. Cons: 45k debt<p>My ultimate goal is to work on machine learning problems in whatever capacity, i.e. doesn&#x27;t matter whether startup,company like Google, or a research lab.

I do this. We like to decide &quot;how cool it&#x27;d be...&quot; and do something. There&#x27;s nothing bad in that, as long as we don&#x27;t start coming up with invented reasons for its reasons to be.<p>When asked to quickly name a tool, most people say &quot;hammer&quot;. When asked to quickly name a site application, most people think &quot;blog&quot;. The focus on blogs inadvertently tells you that these authors were scratching their own itch of making the generator itself, and focused on the first application they could think of, and not responding to real needs. I remember when the coolest thing was for everyone to make their own web framework, everyone focused on making frameworks where blogs were easy to set up and demo. Notice a pattern?<p>In the end though, all sites need a machine to be put on, a server to serve them, and the arbitrary goal of pre-generating basic things like header and footer includes externally has little real value to offer when it comes to business needs (&quot;business&quot; used in a wide sense, as in people&#x27;s real reason to have a site in the first place).<p>Any non-static site can maintain a static cache when performance is needed, and any non-static site can be as simple (and therefore as secure, by function of its complexity alone) as you need it. Maybe your non-static site &quot;engine&quot; can just do basic includes and support a contact form, and nothing else. It&#x27;s easy to secure this, and you draw the line. But there&#x27;s no need to ever cross that specific line where your site is 100% static. You have nothing to gain from it.",1400716227

The LSI 2308 and 3008 controller chips probably support it, but I&#x27;m not finding a commodity card or a motherboard integrating one.<p>They mention in the paper that existing devices have problems which prevent them from actually securely isolating clients of the sub devices. Combine this with seeing a lot of web activity about SR-IOV in 2009 and not much now. Either it became too common to mention, or is dwindling into an idea that didn&#x27;t catch on.

And that is possible. There are hundreds of thousands of 12-year-olds who are obsessed with Minecraft.

I am not that excited about first-person-shoot-em-ups (if I were then I would already have gotten involved), but I might be interested in something more strategic.

And most important of all, I do not read the indy gaming press or attend indy gaming conferences (since I am a NOT the existing demographic), so you need to reach me some other way -- probably through my friends, using some form of viral marketing.<p>The market for independent video games is small, but the market for entertainment is astonishingly large.

There is an actual ongoing struggle for women to feel just as appreciated as men and not feel like they have to fly to the moon in order to be taken just as seriously as their male counterparts.  Sure, they don&#x27;t NEED to be required to select women--exactly the point!  This article is useful in that it points out the disadvantaged position women still face.  If a board does not intervene to try and create a gender balance, then there will be no gender balance, precisely because the issue is unregulated and ignored.  Hmmm... sounds a lot like ignoring regulation on economics--clearly there are actual ongoing issues that can be solved by the private sector and so we should just ignore the potential solutions of the people so that the private sector can really get things done.  Your argument is underdeveloped.  It seems to make logical sense, yes, I credit you that, but the logic is baseless if you ignore the larger picture.",1400715493

My dad noticed that they had listed a Space Ace cabinet for $300. To this day I will never forget my shock — my dad bought it and brought it into our tiny apartment. I had a full-size, real-deal Space Ace arcade cabinet in my childhood bedroom.</i><p>Wow! Father of the decade for him!<p>and...<p><i>With all of these people watching, I played through the final scene of Dragon’s Lair, but with a twist. I didn’t make the last move of the game (sword button, which kills the dragon) allowing myself to get incinerated by his fire breath four times. Not only did this ratchet up the crowd tension to palpable levels, it also increased my score higher than if I had simply beaten the game on the first try.<p>Then, with the crowd on tenterhooks — will he win? Does he really know how? — on that last life, I played all the way through to the end. I pressed the sword button then literally turned around and walked away, while the remaining 10-15 (non-interactive) seconds or so of the game played out. Like the nerd version of the world’s greatest hip-hop act dropping the mic and walking off stage, I just walked away from the game. I’d made the last move. Nothing left for me here.

In fact, not being able to meet their obligations to their customers was an <i>intentional decision</i> on Comcast&#x27;s part.

Also at the cost of duplication, when you use Emacs (or Vi) and tmux/screen (all of them manage windows).\nIn Pharo, the window manager and the text editor are written in the same language, and making them cooperate is a matter of sending messages, which are function calls and binary data. The text editor is an object that is reused multiple times in the system, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the WM could be used to manage windows inside windows.

The 85% statistic is meaningless without knowing how many of the winners within that segment simply folded weak hands and kept strong ones, in which case it would be clear that luck <i>is</i> the dominant factor.

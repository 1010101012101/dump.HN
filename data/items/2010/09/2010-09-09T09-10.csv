People who hate the default libraries just find something better to use.<p>No migration? Use South. Some people run Django on Twisted or Tornado. There are different template libraries that people use. I'm not sure if the model layer can be swapped out so easily (without messing around with custom user authorization), but there's nothing to stop people using django models for authorization, and a separate database interface (even a no-sql one) for other data.",1284026353

1674898,story,,,2,0,ebtalley,"Ask HN: Help with updating development hardware",,"I currently have a Pentium4 630 with 3 gigs of ram that I bought for 150 bucks a year ago that has acted as my main dev machine. I run Windows 7 64 as the host OS and a few different linux flavored VM's for development. I like having a separate VM setup for each development environment that I work in, ie dev1 for Java, Dev2 for Python, dev3 for PHP. This allows me to change the OS environmental variables and permissions without changing things for other projects. The biggest drag on this setup is that I quickly run out of RAM between W7, 1 Linux VM, and Eclipse causing me to suspend one VM to open another.<p>Question:
I would like to build a machine that can handle multiple open VM's each with an open eclipse instance as well as db, and java vm's running on each instance.<p>Paravirtualization would be nice but that seems like a pipe dream at this point, at least from a client perspective, I want to interact with the desktop as normal so Type 2 (VMWare) seems to continue to be the answer.<p>here is a list of my initial criteria:
RAM: 8-12 gigs
CPU: ??
MOTHERBOARD: ??
PRICE: <500$<p>An overstock server seems like a possible option although the server spec components tend to be more pain than its worth for desktop use. I'm not looking to run the latest and greatest hardware, just something that wont get memory bound and can handle 3-4 VM's running computations at once without dogging.

The heuristics outlined are inherently helpful and going through the process would be enlightening, but getting the answers to any of the questions in (a) - (h) are hard (some harder than most).<p>For example ""(a) Ask ourselves what we’re trying to achieve"" I find that this is a problem with most people (including myself), they do not know what they want to achieve, nor how to even start on the process of discovering what they want to achieve. Given this, then the first order question then becomes - How do I find out what I want to achieve?. Answering this question probably involves gaining more perspective and this is probably why ""many people go through long training programs to make money"" (college).

I found myself getting mess on a 30"".<p>Last year I bought the 13"" MBP and a 22"" LCD, but with the new higher-res screens on 15"" MBPs, I think this is the way to go. Same setup wether you're at the office or in a coffee shop. Next time I upgrade I'll definitely get rid of the external screen.",1284022965

The main difference is clarity; though it's a cliche, it really is a case of hearing individual instruments, etc. (though you need high bitrate for this obviously).<p>It is, however, an extremely expensive hobby (and you can't go back). Another great thing about the triple fi's is that you can <i>replace the cable</i>. Since the cable is usually the failure point of any set of earphones this actually makes it quite economical compared to, say, £50 earphones you need to replace far more often.",1284022927

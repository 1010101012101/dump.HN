Scientific secrets we may never discover. Cures to nonexistent diseases. Everything!<p>But this is as meaningless as it is true, because the problem is not that those secrets are present, the problem lies in locating them.<p>I had this conversation years ago on Usenet -- the same question, the same answer. My correspondent seemed to think it was remarkable that all those riches lay within . He didn't seem to realize that the same could be said of any normal, infinite sequence of digits, of which there may be an infinite number (not proven, but it's possible that e, 2, indeed the square root of any non-perfect-square number, all fall into this category).<p>If the grains of sand on a beach could be decoded as binary bits (or as digits in any base) by some accepted convention, and making the same assumptions about normality and infinity, then a beach also contains every secret, every book that has ever been written or will ever be written. But it's the same problem - those secrets cannot be located, distinguished from sequences we might label meaningless, simply because they're answers we're not interested in.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number</a><p>A quote: ""While a general proof can be given that almost all numbers are normal (in the sense that the set of exceptions has Lebesgue measure zero), this proof is not constructive and only very few specific numbers have been shown to be normal.

They feel like some action movies with a character I don't care about (sure Craigs Bonds were better action movies then Brosnans but they've all not been Bond to me.). We don't have to talk about Lazenby and Dalton. Moore and Connery were just perfect. They've fitted perfectly in the flair the cold war had and they will always remain my Bonds.

I had the same issue with the expired PGP key and also received the new key from them manually. The whole process took around 4 months to complete for most of which I was left in the dark. The only notification received came in every 2 weeks to notify me that I was still in queue. Paypal paid me $250 initially and another $500 after the bug was fixed.The initial $250 was actually submitted to the email address on the account I was testing with (which had actually already been ""Restricted"") as opposed my real PayPal address which they requested and I had provided. I was actually surprised by the amount as at no point was I told how much I would receive (I had originally expected the second payment to also be $250). I appreciate the program but they have a lot to learn, in comparison the same process with Etsy took less than a day for them to replicate/patch. Google even with its size takes roughly 3-4 weeks and communicates fairly quickly throughout the entire process. I will say it was rather nice to be able to cash out the bounty in just a few days after each payment but compared to the rest of the companies with bug bounty programs, PayPal's ranks lowest in my opinion.",1350630008

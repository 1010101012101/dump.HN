4744071,comment,4740540,4742372,7,0,ForrestN,,,"My point isn't that everything is meaningless necessarily. I would say that the more one thinks about death the harder it is to make <i>arguments for meaningfulness.</i> I wouldn't make an argument for meaninglessness, I would just say that you can't really extrapolate a positive value system from the fact that life is short.<p>It feels like you're arguing in favor of narrowing our vantage as a way to preserve meaningfulness, which is totally valid to me. But it's basically using a belief (the meaning of temporary things as you put it) as comfort. My point, as was pointed out below, is that you may as well move but you also may as well stay still.<p>As an aside, it seems strange that Jobs is the illustrative example here, as if it's primitive that we should all want to be Him. Given the option to gain a problematic and presumably painful personal life and what I understand was a totally unnecessary early death along with creating apple and ""changing"" an arbitrarily tiny subset of human history, that seems like a very easy thing to decline.

4744064,comment,4743245,4743396,16,0,ringmaster,,,"First, let me say this: I love what you've done with the Ghost design.  I think it's clean and useful.  More on this below...<p>I am one of the early contributors to WordPress (you'll see my name on wp.org's About page near the bottom), and one of the founders of the Habari Project.  We started the Habari Project for many explicit reasons, but in part because the curators of the project (Automattic) were not behaving in a way that we felt was beneficial to the community they had begat.  So let me tell you a little about our project:<p>Not only is the Habari Project an entirely Open Source platform, but it recognizes participants in the project appropriately based on their contributions, something that I did not observe during my tenure working on WordPress.<p>Habari employs the Apache Software License, which is more permissive than WordPress' GPL.  Want to develop a plugin or theme?  Is the code tainted by the GPL?  In WordPress, I don't really know for sure what parts can be redistributed, if any.  In Habari, you can sell your themes and plugins for profit if you want to, or contribute them back to the community -- most themes and plugins so far have been.<p>The passion of the Habari community for producing good, documented code has (in my mind) been one of the driving forces behind WordPress' ""recent"" adoption of similar policies.  The quality and friendly tone of assistance I get from people who know about Habari has been consistently orders of magnitude better than anything I've seen come out of WordPress, which is a characteristic that everyone working on Habari strives to maintain in the project.  One of our guiding principles has been to be a project that is useful for web development education; We've seen a lot of people join our project and learn how to code well, both in the method they use and in the collaborative environment our development often lives in.<p>We've accepted a policy of keeping up with as current a deployment of technology and standards as our core users can stand.  We recently adopted a PHP 5.3 minimum version, and I'm pushing hard to take that to 5.4.  Habari simply does not run on PHP 4, and never will because it's no longer secure.  We code for HTML(5).  We're using CSS3.  Our roadmap (admittedly difficult to find online) includes PSR-0 and namespace adoption to more easily integrate with vendor libraries.  The use of current technology and techniques is really good for developers, and a refreshing change from projects that insist on supporting every old (insecure) server architecture out there.<p>And I'm currently making a living (yes, paying the mortgage) deploying Habari as a CMS for clients.  It is viable.  It is open source.<p>I know first hand how long it takes to build a working product with a small community.  We are admittedly behind in our implementations of some features that WordPress was able to steam ahead with due to their larger community.  There are also non-dev areas like marketing where we could use some work.  We've been trying (albeit weakly) to lure those kind of contributors to the project.<p>We had a talented designer help us with our current admin design, and one of the things people comment on most about it is how it's not as cluttered with s<i></i>t as WP's.  I like the design you've used in Ghost because it's similar to ours, yet modernizes, and I think our community would like it, too.  We've been talking heatedly about a new admin design for our next release...<p>Habari may not be the thing for you, but I do encourage you to take a look, visit our IRC channel on freenode, and take from it what you can.  If you still want to try to bend a WordPress fork, I'm at least interested in the story of your effort and struggle.  And if you want to chat about why we started over (though I think it's obvious, maybe it's not to everyone else) instead of forking, or why a new project with a handful of addons (compared to a competitor) can still be a contender, I'm happy to chat.

The president is expected to set the legislative agenda, meaning that he or she has a lot of influence over what the houses of congress will talk about. ie, the ability to block the agenda of others using veto power until they agree to discuss certain issues. The past several presidents have had control of at least one body of congress, and the majority leader will usually take direction from the president on what should be on the agenda.<p>For example, Barack Obama has had an impact on #5 and #7 from your list. He's most likely going to make a big push on immigration reform in his next term, though it most likely won't involve H1-B visas (though he has spoken in favor of the issue, at the urging of his many silicon valley supporters).<p>Your point is correct that the president is not all powerful.

They simplify the domain management for web designers/developers.<p>I don't want NameTerrific to be the cheapest registrar, the most professional DNS service provider or a losing department of a hosting company. The vision I see is an all-in-one platform that covers every aspect of professional domain management. You get the best uptime and easiest management automatically, and you can customize the experience the way you want.<p>The reason that the APIs haven't been released today is because I'm adding OAuth to it. NameTerrific is designed to completely open up the domain industry to all developers.<p>Unfortunately domainers are never my target audience. Many professional domainers get accreditation themselves to take advantage of cheap prices and stuff like domain cancellation. There's no point competing in such a low margin field.<p>But well, I believe that there will be people (hopefully a lot of them) who want something simple and straightforward and are willing to spend $2-$3 extra a year to get a professional product without doing much work.",1352130580

Asking for 12 is too high if I am renewing a lot of domains.<p>API: A lot of registrars have API access. I am not sure what is special about yours. I've worked with Fabulous, eNom, DirectI, and a couple others. Some are better than others, but what makes you special? In fact, you seem to be built on top of eNom's API.<p>DNS: This is perhaps the only real selling point I see. You're essentially upselling on better DNS and foregoing all the other potential upsells (like hosting). How do you compete against the professional DNS companies? It only takes a NS change for me to be using their services. You're using Route53, why wouldn't I do this myself?<p>Maybe I am not your target audience, but I am struggling to figure out who is. I understand the economics of registrars and I feel like you've cut yourself too small a slice to be sustainable. I have doubts about the funding because you don't own a registrar which reduces costs long term but requires quite a bit of capital. But also creates higher pricing requirements which means less customers. You've given up all but one upsell possibility, which has a lot of competition that geeks are generally familiar with. Your audience is supposed to be savvy, so if they are developing a system that requires a lot of domains they can figure out how/where to get them cheaper and setup DNS too most likely.<p>I like seeing innovation in the domain space, but I fear for the economic viability of this. I also don't honestly see any innovation here. You've complained about what people don't like, but a lot of companies are already going after you main complaints.<p>I think the registrar innovation is pretty dead because of the shitty economics of it. The margins are getting eaten up by VeriSign every year. They make more money doing everything but registrations. Maybe your DNS upsell will work, maybe not.  Good luck.",1352129502

4743891,comment,4743124,4743124,9,0,shazow,,,"When I worked on SocialGrapple (similar featureset to Fruji), here's what I did:<p>* Technically: I had a well-optimized PostgreSQL database which had a few parts: Follower graph schema with a revision id (which node is following which), it got cleaned out every N revisions; a delta schema which took the last two revision ids and diff'd them; an aggregate schema which did a bunch of queries and summarized the results every T interval; metadata schema which stored cached information about each node (updated every time that user object was fetched).<p>I'm pretty obsessive about query and schema optimization, and I had a comprehensive benchmarking suite which helped me consistently improve my performance with bulk insertion as well as aggregate queries as well as user displayed queries. Each job was broken down into small efficient pieces that were executed in dependency order by my custom task scheduler, Turnip (open source at <a href=""https://github.com/shazow/turnip"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shazow/turnip</a>).<p>I don't remember the exact numbers but I was approaching 100M rows on a single 512mb Linode.<p>Redis would have worked too but I would have needed much more RAM or more moving pieces to move things in and out of RAM for processing. None of my queries were slow enough to worry about this.<p>* Pricing: As others mentioned, higher prices make it easier to scale. I charged based on the size of the account and how many accounts you wanted to monitor (basically proxies to how many API calls you'll cost me). A small account cost something like $6/mo, 5 medium accounts $14/mo, 25 bigger accounts at $50/mo, 100 large accounts (1M+ followers) at $125/mo. I had modest revenue but I can't say my pricing scheme was perfect. I was actively messing with it towards the end.<p>* I had a legacy Twitter whitelisted account which gave me 10K api hits per hour. This helped me <i>a lot</i>. At the same time, I was careful to not become too dependent on that account in case I lost it. I was well within the boundary of normal user limits the entire time and only really used my whitelisted account to experiment or backfill new data. I made sure to always make the most efficient API calls to avoid wasting them. I too had issues with timeouts but it more came in waves when Twitter was having infrastructure issues rather than consistently. It wouldn't surprise me if this has gotten worse.<p>Also, I used and stitched all three Twitter APIs: REST, Search, and Streaming. It was painful.<p>* Diversify. Twitter is becoming an increasingly developer-unfriendly platform to build on, and your business should not be dependent on it. I added Facebook support to SocialGrapple, and I was going to add Google+ support too. Today, I'd also add app.net support. That said, the majority of my business was still Twitter, and that sucked. This was a big factor in my decision to sell out and shut it downI didn't see the developer ecosystem as a place where you can have a sustainable business, let alone a thriving one.<p>I actually had several conversations/negotiations with Twitter about how they'd interpret their terms of service wrt my product. It helped to know people at the company to get a favourable ruling, but I still felt like it could be reversederr, ""provided with guidance"" at any moment.<p>For what it's worth, I found it more rewarding to build an analytics product that was super useful for a smaller group of people than a little helpful for a lot of people (I'd say tweepsect.com is the latter). Think about where on the spectrum you want to be as this makes decisions, like pricing, easier.<p>Best of luck! Shoot me an email (in my profile) if you'd like more details.",1352129018

4743878,comment,4743154,4743154,20,0,rit,,,"Most of the listed responsibility items would not fall under the purview of the Executive (the President) but rather the Legislature (Congress - the House + Senate).<p>There seems to be a persistent expectation in the United States that the President is an all powerful position that can dictate laws, etc.  Remember that he can merely suggest to the legislature what should be done.  While executive orders are available they often have limited scope and can be easily challenged (or even ignored).<p>In fact, legislatively the only <i>real</i> power the US President has is negative, not positive - he can say <i></i>no<i></i> to a legislation (by vetoing it).<p>Let's take a look at a few of the proposed items here:<p>* Issue #1: Teach Programming at an Early Age<p>The majority of curriculum decisions are deferred to a LOCAL level in the United States - mandates from individual states & school districts primarily decide what is being taught.  Worse, because Texas is one of the largest text book markets many manufacturers simply print the textbooks used across the US to the Texas educational standards.<p>The only major influence I've seen in recent years on a national education standard is No Child Left Behind which, by many reports, has simply pushed schools to focus on test taking. By many reports, ""Race To The Top"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_Top"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_Top</a>) has made this no better.<p>If you look at Wikipedia's article on the Department of Education, they do not really set policy in the US. Instead, 'The primary functions of the Department of Education are to ""establish policy for, administer and coordinate most federal assistance to education, collect data on US schools, and to enforce federal educational laws regarding privacy and civil rights.""[10] The Department of Education does not establish schools or colleges'<p>* Issue #2: Fixing Immigration<p>Again, this is primarily up to Congress to act on, and there seems to be no desire to do so.  The President really has no influence on this issue directly.<p>* Issue #3 Abolish Software Patents<p>This is primarily a legislation issue  we must fix the patent system and that has to be done in Congress.  The one place a President might influence this would be the appointment of Supreme Court Justices; and let us not forget that Congress has veto power over these.<p>* Issue #4: Internet Freedoms<p>This discusses amending the US Constitution; this process is not done by the US President.  There are, to my knowledge, two ways of amending the US Constitution.<p>1. The US Congress can draft a proposed amendment with a MAJORITY of Congress approving it (2/3+), and put it to the States to ratify - 3/4+ of them must ratify it.<p>2. A Majority of the States can demand Congress form a Constitutional Convention to discuss creating a new amendment, then 3/4+ of them must ratify it.<p>I don't recall if every state deals with the Ratification of amendments the same, but I believe some can have the state legislature ratify on the people's behalf, while others have a direct popular vote.<p>* Issue #5: Cybersecurity<p>You might pull this off at the Executive level, by further empowering agencies like Homeland Security.  But real action requires coordination with a Congress who can draft penalties for companies that don't comply, etc.<p>* Issue #6: Refactoring Congress and Agencies<p>Only Congress may refactor Congress; the Executive has little to no power over this.<p>* Issue #7: Improve Government UX<p>Again, we need Congress to refactor this, and probably constitutional amendment processes.  A system like our Congress thrives on ""insider"" behavior and has little incentive to change itself.<p>* Issue #8: Space<p>Developers may care about space (I do, as well) but the majority of the United States does not. The President may propose a budget, but ultimately the Congress decides it.<p>the NASA budget tends to be less than 1% of the US Federal Budget, and getting it higher than that is a battle that would require a radical change in the perceptions of the American Public as well as Congress.

It was actually a rev share program based on affiliate aggregators like LinkShare and Commission Junction -- that's how we populated our product list. A quick look at some of the sample vendors mentioned and the affiliate programs they use, I suspect you are doing something similar.<p>Problems we ran into included: trying to normalize the product data from the vendors into a format usable to make actionable and accurate ads--the aggregators practiced very little data hygiene and did not enforce much consistency, oddly, some vendors couldn't even spell the names of their products correctly which made for some pretty crappy looking ads; at one point we had over 4 million products listed, primarily because we started importing Amazon products and vendors, so the product selection was difficult, some things have general appeal and would show up all the time and others wouldn't match much content at all; we had trouble signing up sites to display the ads, CPA was relatively new at the time for the scale we were going for, we might have been better off selling our tech to the top affiliate aggregators as a better, easier method for sites to integrate affiliate program membership; reporting was a real bitch because of the delay from click through to actual purchase to the payment showing up, which depending on the affiliate program could be upwards of 90 days.<p>In retrospect, we would have better off setting it up for passive income and not try to do active sales to integrator websites and instead shored up the pitch copy and made it largely self service for the integrators (it mostly was already, but I spent a lot of time tweaking the matching algorithm rather than on the sales/pitch side), and pitched it as an easier way to join affiliate networks.

Equally, the UN could interpose when a country decides to cut off the Internet to avoid communication during chaos or protests.",1352127746

They understand that the electorate is more capable than it realizes and can rise above problems that on paper appear to be too complex or expensive to solve (for example by spending its way out of a depression instead of choosing austerity which shrinks an economy).",1352127656

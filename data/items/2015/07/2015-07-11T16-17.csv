That would at least make it less likely that people read just the first answer, up-vote it, and move on. Each person would see a different &quot;first&quot; answer, at least for some time period.

It tells us exactly how many words are common between the first and last piece, but doesn&#x27;t say whether any factual errors or omissions occurred between the first and last piece. We know that facts and analysis were added, but is that a &quot;danger?&quot;<p>The undercurrent in the blog post, and I predict an undercurrent here, is that reporting on issues of gender is not appropriate for a story about a tech company. The Times article went from basically a transmission of the official line from Reddit, to a more in-depth story of the background and implications. This is presented, implicitly, as a bad thing. I don&#x27;t necessarily agree that it is.<p>The Clinton story had the opposite problem--there were factual inaccuracies in the first version because of the rush to print.

Rather, the harm 
experienced must meet the requisite level of severity.<p>Things already need to be serious before it can be labeled persecution, which means that <i>any</i> persecution is &quot;safe to acknowledge&quot;.<p>The problem is, &quot;persecution&quot; has a many lay meanings, including &quot;any negative social consequence&quot;. Felons, for example, face social negative social consequences even after their sentence is over. Free speech and free association require that some free speech leads to negative social consequences. Someone who stands on the street corner and advocates the return of miscegenation laws will likely get a cold shoulder from others, and may describe themselves as being persecuted for their beliefs. That doesn&#x27;t mean it fits the sort of persecution described at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution</a> .

However, that definition is mostly meaningless and unactionable. Just because the local golf club members feel persecuted because they the city law prevents them from getting enough water to keep the grass green doesn&#x27;t mean they are a persecuted social group, even if others in the town chastise them for wasting water during a drought.

Shipping an Erlang app to production was simultaneously one of the happiest and most depressing points in my career.<p>Happiest because it did exactly what we intended with minimal code and it was done early and under budget (yey!).  The initial group liked Erlang, already knew Erlang and simply were able to bang it out -- delightful!<p>Depressing because of everything that happened after... trying to teach DevOps crew was a nightmare, they HATED us -- all that introspection you can get on an Erlang system only makes sense after lots of experience.  Trying to hire people who already knew Erlang was borderline impossible.  Worse still, hiring people who didn&#x27;t know Erlang and trying to train them up was swimming upstream in multiple ways -- it just didn&#x27;t work.  Erlang is really a bit of its own thing -- and if you are absolutely new to it, very hard to get over the hump... it is a weird pragmatic FP actor system and lacks any sense of purity or type niftyness.<p>... For initial development, Go was less elegant than Erlang, but due to simplicity and really solid tooling probably slightly more productive, but not so much that I would favor it over Erlang.  But the magic happened when we involved other people.  Handing off to DevOps was a DREAM... it was just a binary that logged stuff.  They didn&#x27;t need to know anything about what was in the black box.  Hiring people is already relatively easy for Go, and training up developers in it is a AMAZING.  You can hire basically any competent developer and a week later you have a competent Go developer... 50 page spec and dead simple language works wonders.  No debates about code formatting, builds static binaries in seconds, super-easy to experiment with from minute one (versus getting your head around OTP).<p>I consider myself a programming language geek, I program in dozens and dozens of languages, and love building my own little DSLs.

Sociological privilege often refers to constant and immutable characteristics that cannot be taken away, and moreover makes the value judgment that the group with privilege is bad, and that said privilege must be abolished. This is totally ass-backwards: it should be that the disadvantaged group is elevated to the same level of privilege, because more often than not (excluding class) &quot;privilege&quot; simply refers to the baseline that preferably all groups should be held to.",1436632559

A friend who pushes Go on other forums talked about how it reminded him of programming in his favorite, Wirth-style languages. Interesting that re-creating that experience was an explicit design goal with them drawing on good features of Wirth languages, ALGOL60 (not ALGOL68), and others. The ALGOL60 quote was similarly impressive:<p>&quot;Hoare said of it, &#x27;Here is a language so far ahead of its time, that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors, but also <i>nearly all its successors</i>.&#x27;&quot;<p>Quite an achievement. It was had by using only experienced language designers on the committee. Modern committee-driven actions could learn from this technique of using people with brains and experience.<p>One of their smartest moves was how they marketed it. Many nice language designs happen but don&#x27;t get any traction. Their design choices, tooling efforts, and big company support have been <i>much</i> better than the Java rollout and many minor attempts. My hope for the language is that it replaces the use of C# and Java in as many places as possible so people don&#x27;t have to learn all that mess in maintenance phase. The simpler language should make for nice legacy code work, I think.<p>Bookmarking the article.",1436630894

Alice and Bob retain a shared secret (e.g., a password or set of passwords) that is both private and the foundation upon which the security of the system rests.<p>Observational principle: Alice communicates with Bob over a semi-private channel that can be observed by Oscar prior to the password being secured (i.e., encrypted or hashed). Namely, Oscar can observe the password(s) used by Alice and could even enter in Alice&#x27;s password himself, after coercing her into revealing it.<p>Iteration principle: Unless explicitly prevented by the underlying system, Oscar is not bound to a single instance of coercion against Alice. He may force Alice to authenticate multiple times. Combined with the observational principle (Assumption 2), Oscar can force Alice to use a different password each time.<p>Forced-randomization principle: Oscar can choose to eliminate any strategy Alice may employ through the order in which she reveals the passwords she knows. For example, Oscar may force Alice into writing down a set of passwords so that he can randomly choose the order in which to iterate through them. The assumption is that this option is available to Oscar, not that he will necessarily employ it.",1414382337

8513727,comment,8511918,8513539,0,0,aptwebapps,,,"You may be getting hung up on this concept a little too much.<p>Of course, using a password manager increases the attack surface in that if the encrypted passwords are stored on a server and the encryption wasn&#x27;t good enough you&#x27;re in trouble. But what you&#x27;re talking about, where the plaintext password must be inserted into the web form, doesn&#x27;t strike me as a vulnerability that would not exist without the password manager. If you simply memorized it you would still have to type it in. Moreover, keeping the password secret is not an end in itself, it&#x27;s a tool to keep your actual secrets secret. If you login to some sort of account, and then access those secrets on your computer there&#x27;s the analog hole again.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a computer on which it&#x27;s safe to type in a password you don&#x27;t have one on which it is safe to read or view your secrets.",1414382298

Maybe not quite the horror that was/is openssl -- but clearly an example of &quot;old c code that sort of works&quot; -- perhaps in some ways like bash was/is. It&#x27;s old, it works, but it could use some clean-up (as evidenced by a number of related buffer under/over-flows and whatnot).<p>Note that parsing arbitrary binary (or otherwise) input safely, is a pretty hard problem. There was recently a (resource DOS) bug in libxml2, which have been under quite a lot of scrutiny lately (by virtue of being a brilliant injection vector for malicious code, if a bug can be found).<p>I read this as a two-part bug: one, a lot of people didn&#x27;t know that strings did more complex parsing than a hexdump and a filter for printable strings (me included) -- and it turns out that the &quot;smart&quot; library isn&#x27;t terribly robust (in other words: it&#x27;s typical C code).<p>While it is possible (at least in theory) to write small C utilities that are safe, if you want them to be (wildly) portable, and have sane handling of various kinds of encoded strings, and encoded data, along with handling different endianess -- apparently most people screw up.<p>I think there are two basic camps wrt what should be done: those that think we need something like rust, so that we can have safety without much of a slowdown, and those that say screw it, we&#x27;re no longer running on 5Mhz (or 50Mhz) cpus, we can take anything up to a 100x (10x) slow down without it really being an issue -- Security/stability/predictability is more important.<p>Those that can&#x27;t decide between the two, continue writing C like it was still 1989, and we get lots of stuff like this.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s usually the mix of a &quot;smart&quot; C programmer writing a program that is patched by a &quot;hobby&quot; C programmer, or the fact that getting C right is just too hard -- or that people don&#x27;t -Wall and don&#x27;t run fuzzers and static checkers -- but whatever the reason, we keep seeing serious bugs in C programs.<p>I&#x27;d like to think some of it could be avoided if people wrote more &quot;bloated&quot; C with copious use of functions, more call-by-value, smaller loops, perhaps more computer generated code -- and other &quot;slow&quot; things (while still being C). But I&#x27;m probably hopelessly naive.<p>While I&#x27;m definitely not sold on C++ (at least not as viable &quot;better&quot; C for systems programming), I think the old 1998 article[1] by Strostrup on &quot;simple&quot; C and C++ programs illustrate quite well how hard C can be to get reasonably right, for even simple problems. Perhaps rather than waiting for Rust, a reimplementation on large parts of the backbone of our OSs/GNU in Guile, Lua, or some other higher-than-C level language could be worthwhile.<p>As a side note -- does anyone know of any follow up on Stroustrup&#x27;s article?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.stroustrup.com/new_learning.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stroustrup.com/new_learning.pdf</a>",1414381872

They&#x27;re not going away.<p>It&#x27;s abhorrent that in order to access drugs, you&#x27;ve to essentially send money down the chain to people carrying out such acts...but people are going to do drugs, and in the face of no alternatives, this is where they&#x27;re going to get them.<p>The people buying these drugs, generating the income for these cartels, are so removed from the reality behind them that it may as well be totally unconnected as far as all are concerned. We, first world Westerners, are generally very disconnected from the realities surrounding many of the products we buy, from legitimate products like those manufactured by Nestle, to cheap clothing manufactured in terrible conditions in the East, through to illicit substances such as cocaine which are manufactured in South America and whose trade fuels a bloody war there.<p>Indeed, many of our tech products that we all here use are manufactured by Foxconn, a company whose working practices are so bad that they had issues with people killing themselves on the job and tackled it by installing suicide nets around the back of the buildings and in the stairwells.<p>As such, there is a lot of inherent immorality associated with a lot of the consumerism we here fuel, but the reality for us is that we are extremely disconnected from these issues.<p>But what are the alternatives? Go even harder on those found with drugs, while continuing to let Western consumerism promote without any interference terrible working conditions for our manufacturers in the East?<p>One potential solution to all these issues is to apply a similar approach to all - manufacture these in the 1st world under regulations and subsidize their sale so that the consumer points towards these regulated manufacturers rather than using products manufactured abroad.<p>Unfortunately, while this may be the solution, it itself raises so many other issues. If we took coke production out of the hands of South America and made it in the US, for example, what in hell&#x27;s name is going to happen when the vast numbers of not just cartel members, but relatively innocent coco farmers in South America can no longer derive anywhere near the same income from them?<p>Manufacturing these things ourselves would also, if not greatly subsidized for promotion, drive prices for the consumer up and thus have them pointing in the wrong direction again.<p>It&#x27;s a complex issue and personally I&#x27;m not sure of what the best potential solution may be, but I find it hard to sit here and criticize those using coke in the US from a product containing FoxConn parts where people are miserable and ending their lives because of what our demand for the products being made there is doing to them.",1414381217

And one of my main\npoints is that such a conversion is essentially\nimpossible.  E.g., TeX can read and write files, but,\nthankfully for Internet security,\nHTML can&#x27;t.<p>So, my solution and envisioned converter is to\nconvert TeX output in a DVI file to \nan HTML file.  Such a converter seems doable\nand to solve a concern the OP had.<p>Further,\nmy envisioned converter from DVI to HTML would\ndo just what you are describing.<p>Or, the DVI file has to put the &#x27;f&#x27; of\n&#x27;foo&#x27; at some coordinates (x,y) on the page in some\nfont, say, some bold font.  Fine.  TeX can handle\nlots of fonts, the many standard ones and\nmore if want to make routine use of the ability of\nTeX to handle essentially any font given in the\nform TeX wants.<p>Want to create your own fonts?  Knuth has been there,\ndone that, and left a terrific tool MetaFont, open\nsource, beautiful documentation.  Create all the\nfonts you want and have TeX use them.  Then create\nequivalent fonts for HTML and that a Web browser can\nuse.  Such work with fonts is just making routine\nuse of what TeX has had for decades.<p>So, from the DVI, write to the\nHTML the markup string<p><pre><code>     <b>f</b> \n</code></pre>\nat a position given by absolute coordinates while also specifying the desired font.  That&#x27;s about\nall there is to it.  Seems quite doable to me.<p>Want to convert to PS?  Okay, from the times I\nread the big, red Adobe books on PS, converting from\nDVI to PS is also quite doable.  Indeed, there\nis likely a TeX <i>device driver</i> for that conversion\nnow, as there is from DVI to PDF -- which I use\nheavily.  Indeed, checking, my script for converting\nDVI to PDF uses EXE<p><pre><code>     I:\protex1p2_run\miktex\bin\dvipdfm.exe\n</code></pre>\nand that EXE is standard in the TeX world.  \nIt works fine.",1414380268

I try to be an outlier, and to bring in part of the Hacker News culture of recommending good links rather than crap links to my Facebook wall. If I see crap links from my friends on my Facebook wall, then I reply by calling out the crap in them (linking to Snopes or a better news source for debunking, or identifying bias in certain sources, or whatever). Several of my friends have told me that they appreciate that some of the sources they have heard about (from other friends of theirs, no doubt) are crap, and many have told me that now my posts to Facebook are essentially their news aggregator. I get stories from all over about all kinds of topics, and I post those that I find most interesting to my Facebook wall, with visibility set to &quot;friends only&quot; by default. The best stuff I see over on Facebook from my friends is one source of some of what I submit here to Hacker News. I try to build good online communities by learning from other good online communities. My subset of all the bajillion posts on Facebook is unlike anyone else&#x27;s, but it works for me.<p>AFTER EDIT: Encouraging, as I do both here on Hacker News and on Facebook, informative disagreement, I&#x27;d be very delighted to hear an explanation for the early downvote this comment received. What did you not like about it? How does your experience with Facebook differ from mine, and what is your view of the article kindly submitted here?",1414379190

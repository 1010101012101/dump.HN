It can help to go over all the ""shoulda saids"" afterwards so that you are a little quicker on the draw the next time. It also helps me personally to remember that just as I was socialized to behave a certain way, so were men. Many of them are happy to be given a different option for how to interact with women, assuming I give them the benefit of the doubt, treat it like a bad habit rather than a personal sin, and give them some option better than letting me abuse them instead of letting them abuse me.<p>Intended to be helpful, not critical.

4132836,comment,4132356,4132356,2,0,simba-hiiipower,,,"I think it all comes down to demand generation for Windows 8/RT and the broader Microsoft ecosystem.<p>Case in point, Apple.. People dont queue up for a launch waiting to get their hands on iOS, they want the iPad! Its the device that interests people and gets them invested in an ecosystem, not the other way around. What Apple has always had, and what seemingly all its competitors have lacked, is a focus on developing and marketing products that people really, really want (and the ability to actually do it). Doing so gives ultimate mindshare.. You may not have an iPhone and may not even want one, but Id bet you know more about it and all its iOS goodness, than any other phone out there (bar the one in your pocket, maybe); the average consumer certainly does and that alone provides for a significant lift to Apple's ecosystem.<p>Thats what Microsoft wants, and why we have Surface. Windows Phone is awesome (my opinion), but no one knows about it; the launch of the Nokias Lumia phones are helping, but not really in a big enough way. Microsoft cant let that happen with Windows 8/RT tablets going up against the iPad; because, and I think rightly so, they see that the market is heading towards convergence between what we traditionally think of as PCs and tablets/smartphones.<p>And Id add that its certainly not about increased profitability here.. Microsofts margins are the highest in the industry and one of the highest of any Fortune 500 company (Apple ranks 24th on the list by this measure) [1]. I dont think Microsoft wants to be in the hardware business, it wants to be in the platform/ecosystem business, and part of that business is having devices that drive adoption. Simply put, its about getting people to want a device, a device that runs Windows.<p>[1] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2012/performers/companies/profits/revenues.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2012/perfo...</a>",1340125178
4132835,comment,4131442,4131442,2,0,saintfiends,,,"Back in the days I used to do this. I would stay up better part of the night adding random people to MSN or ICQ and sending the Trojan saying it was my picture. So before sending it I would describe myself as someone they'd want to see, to drive up their curiosity, basically I'll be what they'd want me to be. This was very successful. I never maintained a big list of zombied boxes, I'd infect remove on a per night basis depending on how bored I was.<p>I also saw the progression of hiding IP's in MSN connections. At first they would make a direct connection, later they only made a direct connection while transferring files bigger than a certain size. They completely removed it after some point, don't remember very well.<p>After I got to know more about networking how things are connected, I realized that my ISP allowed to initiate NULL sessions to other customers. I remember how excited I was to find this. I would place the RATs everywhere with curious names in hopes for them to click or just test exploits on them.<p>Another interesting thing I found was I was able to invite anyone, even random emails (Hotmail) while having a group chat. I had so much fun doing that back then.<p>After infection it was basically just chatting, messing with the LED's, CD-ROM's.. people were more interested in finding out how I did it and just chat rather than being mad. I remember one time when I did this to a friend he got scared and ripped of the cable breaking the wall socket.<p>It was really easy to evade anti-virus programs at the time. I usually just split the file into half, run the scanner on it, split again until I narrowed down to the signature and would just change a value or two.<p>It was interesting to see how many times people change the text before hitting send while chatting. Obviously I was too naive to know and respect privacy back then.",1340125172

If youve been at this for a year, clearly next month wont be $5000, (unless it's an internet business, where a single good source of publicity can easily bring you from 500 from x paying customers to 5000 from 10x as many) which means even in the sense that its kicking off cash its not sustainable in the long-term, (unless, like all Internet companies, costs are largely fixed or at the least certainly don't grow linearly with number of paying customers) not defensible in the market, not supporting even one human being in that effort, etc.. (unless it's an Internet business that can go from paying you 200 per month to 2000 per month without you so much as being sure where all these customers came from, how they heard about you.)<p>Therefore, in the normal sense of the phrase profitable business, its not. (unless you mean ""profitable business"" as a person normally means it when it comes to a startup).<p>So now that Ive perhaps unfairly ridiculed you, (now that the author has ridiculed himself) lets just recognize whats really going on, because its wonderful and amazing and fantastic and exciting: (since it's not descriptive of most projects)<p>Youre building a business! (your project is cash-flow positive.) Sure its just begun, sure it might need a kick in the ass, sure it might be struggling, sure sure sure, so what? You and every other little new business. You and every other bootstrapper who by very definition doesnt explode out of the blocks because youre doing it part-time and with no cash. (that's not anyone's definition.  you can explode out of the blocks or you can languish.) This is exactly what youd expect it would do, even if youre actually the next 37signals. (unless your expectation is different.)<p>Thats exactly what my company WP Engine looked like for the first 9 months. Now were making millions of dollars, employ 20 people, growing at 15%/mo, etc..  But we started just like that  slowly, and not profitable. (sounds like you did it from 50-100k in savings or seed capital, which puts you squarely in the type 1 bracket.)<p>Same with my previous company Smart Bear  it took 2.5 years before I could even hire one employee, and even then it was 1/4 of the salary he deserved (and later ended up making).  Eventually we, too, made millions of dollars a year  in profit!  but not for years. (during those years I bet the net cash flow ever had reached -20k easily.  all in direct costs.)<p>In other words, theres nothing strange or bad here. Its just not profitable from day one. Stop saying that. (unless you're cash-flow positive from day one, which is a different type of internet project).<p>Dispense with the feather-fluffing and get to what is  the strengths you have, the challenges you want to overcome, the resources at your disposal. (And if you've proven a scalable, repeatable business model that pays for its own hosting and direct expenses other than the time to develop it, I suppose you shouldn't boast about that fact?  After all, it's not like if a web service is developed in 100 hours, you can keep running it without redevolping it from scratch every month, as though you'd just lost all your backups.)<p>And then set your mind and goals on making that sucker profitable for real!  (turn your positive cashflow into a sizeable source of revenue.  which nobody assumes you have if you mention the former.)<p>P.S. Need help figuring out how to do that? Go here to learn about the Smart Bear Live podcast where Ill help you one-on-one, or email me to see whether I can turn your question into a blog post.

Fine.  Go ahead.  Say that instead.  Or say the synonym ""profitable since day 1"" since everyone knows that's what you mean.<p>Let's do this.  Do you think the article would still make the same argument if it read, instead, ""Stop claiming to be cash-flow positive since day 1 - meaning day 6-23, besides your fixed consumer expenses!""<p>Then the article would read:  (In parentheses is my point-by-point critique).<p><i>Stop claiming youre cash-flow positive (not including consumer expenses)\nJUNE 19, 2012 2 COMMENTS<p>4\nShare<p>My company is cash-flow positive, and has been from day one. (meaning day 7-23 after coding it up and getting customers very soon)\n                            every high-tech bootstrapped founder (Actually, only a SMALL percentage of ALL projects, and a LARGE percentage of projects that can justify you giving them money.)<p>I know what you really mean.<p>What you mean is that the only business-related charges on your PayPal MasterCard  aside from those on intentional detour for tax-deduction like the external DVD drive you needed to rip CDs after you realized the MacBook Air in all its luxurious, silent, thin, sexy glory still cannot import The Best of Pat Benatar without the aid of a peripheral half the size and weight of the laptop itself  is an account with Amazon AWS where a medium instance whirs away for only $40/mo, just two clicks away from rebirthing as an XXL should you need scale, plus $0.67/mo for the S3 storage for web app uploads, plus $0.072/mo of S3 storage to back up the Pat Benatar mp3s.<p>(And you also don't count your rent, phone, Internet, and other expenses you currently have related to launching your business.)<p>So all you needed to do is sell one $49/mo account  which you did  and youre cash-flow positive! (Except the above-mentioned things).<p>I know thats what you mean, but when you say Im cash-flow positive to someone with a modicum of experience its a turnoff, (unless they care about a scalable, repeatable business model you have already proven) because its actually bullshit (if somebody with ""common sense"" thought that any Internet business on the planet got ten thousand customers the very first day the founder had the thought to start coding it up). And when someones streaming bullshit at 720i, it means theyre either a full-blown bullshit artiste or theyre merely ignorant; in neither case do I want to hear more.  (in other words, I've been burned by the recent bubble pop and I need some time to see you grow some more before I continue gambling.  That doesn't mean it's not great that you're already cash-flow-positive.  It means I'm a sore loser.)<p>The first and biggest error is thinking you can ignore your own salary. (Which nobody expects you to include when you say you're cash-flow positive.)  Sure your time is worth $1000/hr (your opportunity cost is more like 80 dollars per hour if you weren't running the business, since you would accept a salary at 160k... the 1000 dollars heuristic is only to keep you on track if your business will keep growing and be acquired), but no you do not have to cover that to be dubbed profitable. (nor do you have to cover your foregone salary of 160k).   But you do need at least a ramen-profitable definition of valuing your time. (no, you don't.  even 2 dollars per hour is not necessary, nor is being able to pay for your apartment, car, phone, and Internet.) If your business makes $3000/mo after direct expenses, but isnt paying you, and you still have a full-time day job to keep up with the mortgage on your under-water house, then youre not profitable. (and if you can stop doing any work on it and the venture keeps generating $3000/mo after direct expenses, making 36k in a year or 200k in ten years as usage tapers off and customers switch away, and you use that 200k to buy a house somewhere.  Well, you didn't just buy a house with the profits or positive cash-flow of your company, no-siree, you bought it with, uh...)<p>Why not? Because the business cannot sustain even one person to run itself, which means that $3000 is not extra money which can be plowed back into the business or distributed for an awesome vacation.  (Unless the business can operate without one person, which is not mentioned here, or unless you can hire someone for a thousand dollars a month to maintain it and pocket the 2k per month difference).  Its just made-up leftovers because youre not acknowledge the actual costs of a startup, which include time and you having to work a second job.  (Likewise, your salary isn't actual cash-flow you can use to buy stuff.  It's an illusion!  If you make 200k in salary, but could be making the equivalent of 500k by founding a startup and selling it 5 years from now, that's not 200k you're earning.  That's 300k you're losing.  You don't have a job: you're a parasite on, well not society, but on your alternate self, whom you're robbing of 200k...)<p>In that case what have you proved? That if you slam yourself to the limit of endurance and ability, you can earn less money than Dell would give you for creating 1/34th of BIOS version 8.4.3.5?<p>Thats not a cash-flow positive business.  (Unless you look at cashflow).<p>If you are living off it, even if thats $3000/mo, then youve made it. You might not have a dynamo on your hands (yet!) but at least youre in a somewhat sustainable place. Maybe next month youll make $3200 and you can plow that extra $200 back into the company. (likewise, if someone gives you 500k per year to be VP of Vatever at their company, and you spend it all on your lifestyle, you haven't made it at all.)<p>The other error is that its a misuse of whats normally connoted by the phrase profitable business. (cash-flow positive business.  Normally it means, in the first year of a business especially, but usually in the first couple of years of a startup, that you could keep putting time in and getting more money out than your business uses up.  If you have savings of twenty k, you can run the business for two years and have savings of...thirty k.  Where does the extra 10k come from?  Oh, that's right the ""non-profit"" we all totally rightly call ""profit."")<p>When someone says theyve been in business for two years and they turned profitable last month, what that really means (if its a healthy, growing business) is that they are sustainably profitable, able to indeed plow the rest back into the company with a quantity of cash that could visibly move the needle on top-line revenue, or could significantly reduce further risk, or would allow for investment in a long-term project, or could be a down payment on a superstar, or something similarly valuable.  (Or maybe it means the restaurant costs 10,000 per month in property, commodity prices, waitstaff, and all other expenses, and has just turned a profit of 200 for the first month after all that stuff was paid for, and at this rate you'll regain the 50k you invested to get it there in...well I'll let you do the math.  That doesn't mean it's healthy does it.)</i>",1340124486

""ramen profitable"" the amount of profits you have to plow back into the company are as much as the cost of a Ramen package.  It is a way of saying you're not  profitable to a significant degree, but you are covering your expenses and thus you're not in the process of dying.   This is an important milestone, because it means the company is sustainable and the stress level on the founders is going to be a lot less than ones who are slowly depleting their life savings (or quickly depleting it.)  And it also means that any additional money will be going into growth, rather than into keeping the startup alive.  This is pretty important, or should be, to investors.<p>I think this is a much better metric to seek than the ""we've grown our user base by 1 million percent!"" from a company that isn't taking in any money from its users, and whose users would never pay money to use the service (perfect example: Facebook) but <i>has</i> also gotten $1M+ in investment and has spent significant money.  How do you tell the difference between that and buying users?   The latest thing these days is to say ""we got X users and we didn't spend any money on marketing"".<p>Really? So you don't know what your acquisition cost really is?  You want me to think that your social network for accountants is going viral?  When your user base is about the size I'd expect it to be when all the other ""Social Network for X"" founders from Angel.co show up to see what you're up to?<p>Back to the article-- I think he's spot on to point out the difference between ramen profitable and profitable enough to hire an employee who's getting a real salary.   That is another milestone.<p>But I think ""we're profitable from day one"" is really not a bad thing, because many of the other companies out there have no path to profitability without a whole lot more funding (Eg: Facebook, which took a lot of money.)   It did pay off for Facebook, but your social network for taxidermists is not another Facebook.<p>So, ""we're profitable from day one, even though we're only covering operational expenses and not covering employee living expenses yet"" is still a significant piece of information compared to the companies that will take another $5-$50M to get even to that point.<p>Also, FWIW, my startup, which will likely be ""profitable from day one"" (but not ramen profitable) will be requiring about $300 a month in hosting-- and that's getting a dirt cheap deal.  Not all of us are just a website that can run on a single server... we're building a cluster of dedicated machines and we need to do that before we open the doors.  Fortunately, $300 a month for ~5-6 dedicated machines is kinda amazing![1]  This is also one way where ""immediately profitable"" is more achievable than it was a decade ago.<p>[1] Hetzner.de has dedicated machines for cheap.  Our product is very amendable to a CDN, and our major partner is hosting a lot of the higher bandwidth stuff on their own global CDN anyway, so locating in germany is not nearly the issue it would be for us if we were doing a social network for philatelists.",1340124037

Wikipedia's strict rules (really, a hideous mish mash of conflicting obscure scattered policy and guideline and suggestion and essay and convention) detract from the purpose of getting information about a subject from a variety of trusted sources into an article about that subject.<p>See, for example, the amount of time that goes into deciding whether to allow someone to have a username consisting of a bunch of digits or not.  (Such a user name is ""confusing"". But what is it confused with?  It's not confusing by itself.  The policy is to prevent people using names that imply power. and so on for several megabytes, several times a year.) And then, when the community has taken several months (at a short time estimate) to agree on a policy they realise that the software has hard-coded limits which are different to the policy anyway.  So it all starts again.<p>SO's mods are doing a good, but difficult job.<p>Wikipedia's admins, New Page Patrollers, Anti-Vandal Patrol, Recent Change Patrol, twinkle user, rollback user, are doing an inconsistent job.<p>I'll agree that I'm pretty anti the current WP experience.",1340124017

4132613,comment,4131771,4131771,9,0,nirvana,,,"The assumption implicit in this article seems to be that the two programs are equally available to entrepreneurs.  In considering the two programs for my startup, I don't think this is the case.  I haven't been in either program, but I have been watching both for 5 years it seems.<p>YC seems to be far more selective, and while the classes are growing each year, they are not growing as fast as the number of applicants.   YC also seems (rightly or wrongly) to be more focused on 18-23 year olds who are in or just out of college, who want to do a startup, and who can show the kinds of ... bonafides that a college student can show (Eg: more academic related.)<p>In contrast, Techstars is following a franchise model and growing the number of programs rapidly, and now in fact has a global accelerator network so expansive there's even versions in Dubai and Tel Aviv![1]  TechStars seems more interested in traction, and founders who have startup experience.<p>Put another way, YC is very much like a harvard, while TechStars is like a state college network.  There's only one YC but there's a TechStars in every major town.<p>This means TechStars is more accessible, even going so far as some of the smaller programs in the global network which (at least in one case I know of seem to be) not super choosy.  This is quite a contrast to YC which is very selective and has a close knit network.<p>They are focused on different market segments in another way.  TechStars knows you might pivot, and all investors say ""its about the team"" but TechStars seems more interested in startups that are in progress, while YC is even open to people who don't have an idea at all.   In TechStars you should pivot if you have to, but in YC a part of the program is reworking what you're doing, and it seems to be more assumed.<p>Finally, I think it must be admitted that YC has probably a lot better potential for raising big money on demo day.  Techstars ranges from close to YC capability for Boston and New York, to nowhere near as strong. (have any graduates of The Ark, a TechStars affiliate in Arkansas, raised more than $5M? $1M?)[4]<p>So, I think the two programs have two very different target markets, and very different levels of opportunity they provide.<p>To extend the college metaphor further, you should apply for YC if you're under 30[2], but you probably should also apply for TechStars as a backup, given the slim odds of getting into YC. So, this is like applying to Harvard but also another Ivy League school and your state college as a last ditch backup.  YC would be Harvard, TechStars NY, etc would be the other Ivy League and TechStars global network would by your state college analog.<p>Frankly, there are also a lot of contests and other programs.  In fact there are hundreds of programs.  We're going to apply for probably a dozen different things happening this fall.  From TechCrunch disrupt to TechStars and international affiliates.<p>One thing I've found is there's a shelf life for startups at the incubation stage.  After you've been working on your startup for 6 months to a year you get to a point where what you really need is angel funding.   So, for that first 6 months to a year, you probably should apply for a lot of the early stage opportunities.<p>[1]<a href=""http://globalacceleratornetwork.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalacceleratornetwork.com/</a>  (at first I thought it was in Iran given the way the map looks on the page.)<p>[2] I know YC doesn't discriminate on age, but it really does seem like they are looking for people in their 20s.  Their application asks for your HN ID for instance.  This is a good thing. Without YC there wouldn't be this kind of program for recent grads who want to  do a startup.  When you're an investor you have to be choosy about your sector. Some insurance company might be a great investment, but if you don't know how to evaluate insurance companies, then you would still pass.  YC seems well tuned to evaluating younger entrepreneurs.<p>[3] We're in Startup Chile.<p>[4] I don't know and it is not a reflection on the goodness or the badness of The Ark as a program if they haven't had that kind of success.  It is more an example of the different segments of the startup market that they are addressing.",1340122508

True, a QR code may help me reach deep info easily, but a QR code has meaning ONLY to a computer; a URL has meaning to both a computer and to a human.<p>Let's say I see a poster advertising, say, a contest by Budweiser to win Superbowl tickets. Two scenarios that, for the sake of argument, are mutually exclusive: A) The poster has a QR code. If I don't scan that QR code then and there my interaction is done.  B) The poster has a URL (BudweiserSuperbowl.com).  If I don't visit that site while I'm standing next to the advertisement there's still a chance I may remember the URL and decide to check it out later.  This is the similar to the reason we invented DNS to obviate the need to memorize IP addresses.<p>brk's example of a QR code on a washing machine at Best Buy was far more useful to Best Buy than to the customer: scanning a bar code can yield technical info, reviews, prices etc. whereas scanning a QR code will only give you the information that Best Buy or the manufacturer wants you to see.<p>Some places I wouldn't mind seeing QR codes:<p>- Videogames have more and more long alphanumeric strings to enter to enable online features, downloadable content, et al.; why not also include QR codes for Kinect to scan?<p>- Mini QR codes on menus to take you directly to nutritional info for a dish could be cool",1340121879
4132537,comment,4131462,4132162,8,0,DanBC,,,"People have different expectations from a Q&A site.<p>SO is pretty rigid about what they want. That's a good thing - their servers, their rules.  Firm guidelines allow users to find either post useful questions, or find some other site.<p>Except, that's not what happens.  Someone asks a question that's a lousy fit for the SE format; and people like it, and upvote it and answer it and the answers get upvotes.  Then some mod comes along and closes it, and there's a bunch of negative feeling.<p>SO is <i>huge</i>, and needs constant tending to keep it useful.  Cool urls don't change, but when Mark Pilgrim (who has a gajillion urls over SE) leaves the Internet there's a gajillion urls that need to be found and changed.  (No, I have no idea why a site run by programmers, for programmers, can't kludge together a script to search for and replace urls.)  That's one small example.  There are plenty of other examples.<p>Then there's the ""problem"" of duplicate answers.  Ideally, there would be one great question, with a bunch of answers, with the best answer being upvoted most and the answer most fitting being accepted.  But very few people searches before asking, and all the tags are not useful, so there are a lot of duplicates.  That could be okay, except the dupes are usually worse quality than one great question.  And the answers lose quality over time - there's only so many times that someone is going to write a great answer.<p>Then the gamification is broken on some of the sites.  You start off almost unable to make any contribution, and people with low scores do not get the upvotes.  (This guy with a million votes must know what he's talking about, UPVOTE.)  In theory you could concentrate on an obscure segment.  In practice not much on SO is obscure because there are so many users.<p>The fragmentation is a bigger problem, I think.  I want to ask a question about linux software, on my Ubuntu install.  Already there are two different SE's I could ask on.  There could be more depending on the software.  This is a more vicious form of the duplicates problem.<p>The proliferation of SEs into ever more niche segments is okay, I think.  They either sink or swim.  Lousy for you if you've invested time and effort into something that sinks.<p>There is definitely a niche for a subjective version though.  All those questions that peope love to ask, and answer. (""What's your favorite monspace font?"" ""What are your 3 most important programming pearls of wisdom?""  ""What book did you find most useful when you started, and what is most useful today?"" etc etc.  Obviously, versions of these questions exist in reddit and /prog/ and news:comp.* and etc etc.<p>FWIW I love the SE sites, and I love the fierce moderation.  I've disagreed with it at times, and certainly with the cold way it gets implemented.  But I'm glad SE exists.  I just wish I knew a where I could ask different questions and have them seen by a huge crowd of clueful users.",1340121872

The customer provided a routine where they would have the end-users' disk controllers read a hidden half sector at the end of a half-sized normal ninth sector, I think was the gist of that particular scheme.<p>If I remember correctly, they had typed some example code in plain ascii, so we obliged with the typical ""help, I'm being held captive in a Chinese disk duplication company.""  Which was almost true, as the owners of our company were of Chinese decent.  And in my defense, we did have a number of all-nighters (with Pizza) when another software company would call us with a sudden ""we've changed the masters - erase and re-dupe whatever you have).""  I was younger, then...<p>Anyway, a few messages were passed back and forth this way, before we got back to serious business and implemented the copy protection scheme.  Not really a virus, but still geeky fun.<p>Did you know that 8"" floppy disks had excellent aerobatic qualities when flung from the top of a building?

Their OS must be seen to be not just relevant to the next generation of hardware - but seen to shine in that role.<p>I think it is entirely sensible for MS to produce a new product that show the world how they think things should be done - with complete control over every aspect of the design.

Instead of, ""I would expect this framework to behave as follows but it's not"" it's ""Here's 50 lines of code, why isn't it working?"" The only way to answer such questions is to get their code up and running somewhere, perhaps on a jsfiddle, figure out what's wrong (often something as trivial as a syntax error), and then tell them. Doesn't feel very gratifying to do one off debugging on behalf of the person asking especially if the answer is unlikely to be useful to others in the future.",1340121651

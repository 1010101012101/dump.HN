The FBI agent investigating me was quite friendly on his first visit until I said I didn&#x27;t want to talk to him without an attorney. He didn&#x27;t even visit me until he&#x27;d spent a week talking to other people first, none of which mentioned it to me until much later. He was even less friendly in court.<p>It&#x27;s no accident that they showed up dressed casually or that one &quot;had&quot; to use the restroom. Entirely planned. These are experienced investigators. The fact that multiple agents showed up is a bad sign. That means they&#x27;re devoting some significant resources to this investigation.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I would hire an attorney yet, but it might be time for everyone involved to ask around for recommendations and have some contact info for an attorney on hand in case you needed it.",1376168310

What patents would they target?  What adversarial setting would they defend / attack patents in?  Couldn&#x27;t this result in a race to the bottom about what things people want in the public domain - ie. a bunch of people petitioning to have a law firm attack Amazon&#x27;s One-Click patent?  Basically if someone made something desirable enough, then an efficient market would funnel enough money into trumping their patent through your concept, destroying whatever incentive the company had to make something valuable.<p>I could be off on what your suggesting, so i apologize.<p>While there are lots of flaws & advantages in the patent system, one major opinion I have is that there should be some sort of use/active-pursue requirement.  Ie. you can&#x27;t claim property ownership over an idea unless you&#x27;re actively putting it into product / trying to figure out how.  Or maybe a shorter length of the patent (ie. 5/10 years), unless you&#x27;re actively pursuing it.<p>This would be similar to adjustments in other types of property law.  Ie. a lot of property law is based on incentives to define ownership / acquisition in a means that most benefits society.  For example in the old property case Brazelton, they didn&#x27;t award ownership to the person who found a sunk ship & squatted on it, but rather awarded ownership to the person who came later but actually had the technology to lift it.",1376166062

Heck, it might&#x27;ve just been a silly idle thought you never thought anyone would take seriously.  Someone will take it seriously.  You might say, &quot;Don&#x27;t take this seriously.&quot;  Someone will still take it seriously.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, though: if you can be misunderstood you will be misunderstood.  As those often-microscopic misunderstandings compound, people lose a sense of direction.  As a founder you&#x27;ll be repeating yourself and the core values and mission of the company over and over and over again until you want to throw up.  This becomes more true as the company grows.  A small company often operates more like a hive mind where there&#x27;s a huge amount of implicit, shared understanding.<p>My personal strategy is this.  In a normal situation if I have a clear idea of what I think should be done, get the key stakeholders into a room to Solve Problem X.  Insist that before they get into the room they think about some ideal ways to solve Problem X.  If necessary, constrain the solution space by giving high level priorities.  Once in the room, have folks share their thoughts.<p>As CEO you should grill their ideas as intensely and rigorously as possible.  You should have a fuller set of facts than they do (hopefully), which means you should be able to see holes they don&#x27;t.<p>Most of the time -- assuming you&#x27;ve hired smart people -- your idea or something close to it is one of the ideas that staff brings up.  It might even be an improvement on your idea.  If that happens, great!  You&#x27;re done.  Nobody needed to know you had the same idea and Jane Doe Staffer gets credit for a good idea.<p>More often than you&#x27;d expect, someone else brings up an idea that simply never occurred to you in the first place.  This idea would never have surfaced if you started the conversation with your thoughts.<p>This is win-win-win.  The good idea wins.  Jane wins because she was empowered to come up with a good idea and saw it realized, which means she&#x27;ll be excited to do it again in the future.  The team wins because they see you&#x27;re the kind of person who accepts and integrates good ideas.  As Harry Truman said, &quot;It&#x27;s amazing what you can accomplish if you don&#x27;t care who gets the credit.&quot;<p>If the idea doesn&#x27;t come up then you might introduce your own or guide the conversation in a way where folks in the room think of it, e.g., there&#x27;s some fact you have that nobody else does.

It is true in high income levels that you can gain with tax planning, but I wouldn&#x27;t say many are taxed less. Actually taxes/costs are pretty hurting for many starting entrepreneurs or small businesses.<p>If entrepreneur wants money out of the company (like for rent), she pays the taxes twice. Once as a corporation (28%) and then again as capital gains tax and/or as an income tax (+ all the costs that comes with employing yourself). Rule thumb for starting entrepreneurs that you need to make at least twice the money you want to make as an individual since taxes and costs the other half.<p>This is more of a case that wealthy individuals have more options and sometimes they use them and not about entrepreneurship. If you don&#x27;t have a high income, you&#x27;re probably paying more taxes(+costs) as entrepreneur than as an employee.",1376165365

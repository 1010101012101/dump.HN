You can solve the problem in many ways, each one getting more functional and abstract. Eventual so abstract that you can't really tell what going on.<p>Another issue is the fact that it interacts with the JVM. Short answer, it seems nice, but if you're functional, you can't really use the 3rd party libs because you can't be sure they will play well in the functional world. Long answer is here. <a href=""http://talesfromannoyance.blogspot.com/2012/05/why-im-looking-at-erlang-over-scala.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talesfromannoyance.blogspot.com/2012/05/why-im-lookin...</a>.<p>I'll probably double back to Scala at some point, but I think a language off the JVM is a better option.

4981283,comment,4980588,4981197,4,0,fusiongyro,,,"Only one of the Haskell shootout programs uses `unsafePerformIO` now (n-body). While it looks to me like most of them make fairly heavy use of Foreign and thus low-level types, I don't think this automatically makes Haskell code like messy C code. After all, there still isn't pointer arithmetic, types don't magically transform into other types behind the scenes, and there's still a fair degree of non-strictness. More importantly (and contrary to C's ""messiness"") it's seldom difficult to take Haskell optimized with these low-level features and wrap it up in a nice high-level package for use from elsewhere. It's a curious and wonderful property of GHC that you can enable all the extensions you want on a module-by-module basis without creating a lot of cross-module drama. These are properties other languages should strive for.<p>Writing exceptional, highly performant Haskell is still a black art, sure. But writing performant Haskell is basically writing Haskell with a modicum of knowledge and respect (less lazy IO, more ByteString, more iteratees, etc). Writing highly performant Haskell is becoming easier and easier; the runtime system will give you detailed statistics about where your problems may lie, tools like ThreadScope can give you all the information you'd ever want, and many of the commonly-used libraries are heavily optimized for speed (Text, ByteString, iteratees, etc) which you benefit from basically for free.<p>It's not a panacea but I haven't ever had to use anything more sophisticated than strictness annotations, and even that I use pretty sparingly. Like the best black arts, it's very seldom necessary, and becoming more seldom every day.<p>As a side note, I would love to see an alternative ""honest"" shootout where programs must not do much overt ""doping"" (such as using Foreign and `unsafePerformIO`) because it would be interesting to compare the ""native"" speeds of different languages, with the kind of code the best normal people would write for themselves or their employer. Haskell has always abused its low-level facilities for higher placement in the shootout than it really deserves.",1356760319

If you read the TOS, they were reserving the right to advertise against your photos much like how sponsored stories work on Facebook.<p>Dude, are you Instagram's lawyer? How can you be so sure?? Either way, you still don't get the point. It wasn't about whether they were going to sell it or not. It was about they giving themselves the 'right' to automatically, possibly do so <i>in the future.</i><p>Naturally, when you do something like this, especially with others' data, you could in the least inform them. Because it's their fucking content. When I joined facebook and orkut, I saw the ads on the side. I knew it was a compromise I had to make. So it really didn't matter to me.<p>That's why I still use Google. Because I know the company is trying to make money by letting me use it. With Instagram, when I joined it, there were no ads nor did they tell me or give me a hint that my photos would be 'sold'. An average user would have assumed it would remain free forever, but I knew they would somehow need to make money. But, they didn't express their intent to make money (through selling your photos) clearly because they knew if they did so, no one would join their service. Hence they basically deceived you into joining their service for free initially and one fine day gave themselves the rights to sell your photos. That's unethical. The problem here is I took the effort to get the photo right, but I am NOT compensated monetarily for my effort. Instead Instagram just benefits from it. So it's like a free photo sharing site first that is automatically turned into a stock photo site without your consent where you don't even get any benefits when your photo is sold. I'm sorry, that's unacceptable and that's unethical.<p>What the consumer owns is none of your business - be it \nbabies, dogs, sunset or even elephants. It's their will to do what they want with their phone's camera. And like I said, there's even nothing wrong with monetizing these photos as long as you express your intent clearly.",1356758739

I know a few folks locally who've been batting around ideas in this space, so it's a topic somewhat near at hand to me. :)<p><i>1) if it's a customer problem, it's a restaurant problem.</i><p>For certain classes of problems, sure, but there are things like your stated ""I want movies, media, etc. while I wait on my meal"" that may or may not be worth addressing for any given restaurant--the degree to which the ambiance entertains the diner could be great (a bar with live bands) or nonexistent (a quiet steakhouse). A restaurant need not concern itself with your vegetarian friend if doing so would significantly complicate their supply chain or logistics. It's not always a restaurant problem by any stretch.<p><i>2) simplicity helps restaurants as much as customers</i><p>The general principle of simplicity, sure, but the implementation can be a headache. If the marginal utility and increased revenue of having four times the number of burger options outweighs the simplicity of limiting to two entrees and nailing the supply chain but getting lower sales, then why bother? Simplicity isn't always needed or desired, and is a preference of the diner just as much--if not more!--than of the restaurant.<p><i>3) shorter wait time / quicker payment helps restaurants as much as customers</i><p>No argument here, but I think that this is just as easily solved using existing resources (i.e., train employees better) than implementing a whole electronic ordering system.<p><i>4) happy customers order more, come back more often</i><p>Happy customers do come back more often, and <i>may</i> order more, but again you don't need to buildout a crazy electronic ordering system From The Future (tm) to make your customers happy--I've witnessed people at very high-end high-touch establishments actively turn away attempts at injecting technology (electronic wine lists, in this case) into what they prefer to be a human-to-human interaction.<p><i>5) pretty sure we have experience in the industry, from 20+ investments in the category. certainly several of our entrepreneurs know what the hell they're doing, especially ElaCarte (also YC co & Lightbank co)</i><p>I wish you luck on your investments! I'm sure you've got some awesome folks you're working with.<p>~<p>I'm not assuming a zero-sum game--I'm simply noting that while it helps both sides, it doesn't help the other side <i>enough</i> perhaps to justify a real change in business. You notice the big change towards electronic ordering (see the Jack in the Box kiosks) in large nation-wide chains where they've so relentlessly optimized and cheapened the dining experience that shaving fractions off their costs on ordering makes sense. For a taqueria or something, the value prop probably isn't there.<p>EDIT: Also, after looking at your disclaimed companies... my God, man, you really seem to like curated experience and deliveries. Any thoughts you'd like to share on the topic, where it's going, etc.?",1356758659

They don't just target women, they target anyone to get a reaction out of them for the ""LULZ"".<p>Part of the reason why she is targeted by trolls is she has a position of authority and organizes events but doesn't have a detailed background experience or knowledge in them (she says so herself) which the trolls see her as just another ""stuffed shirt"" (or suit, a stuffed shirt implys that the person stuffs a shirt to make it look like muscle or something they are not to fool people, no sexist remark meant there, consider the alternative of a 'phoney' or 'scammer') pretending to be a hacker. (Their view not mine.) They would have done the very same things if she was a man. (Maybe call him gay or racist names instead of sexist remarks)<p>I see that she is into 'disruptive journalism' from my experience it is a different form of advertising and marketing. For example, Marvel Comics kills off Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus' body after a body-swap. They did it as 'disruptive journalism' or 'disruptive media' to get reactions from people who loved Spider-Man and Peter Parker to Tweet and Blog about it over outrage to make Marvel Entertainment and The Superior Spider-Man comic get more attention and free publicity. In the same way she is using 'disruptive journalism' to draw attention to her blog and herself by making people react to it. So now she makes front page at Hacker News (Edit people are voting this article down, good for you, no more front page) and it is blogged and Tweeted everywhere. 'Disruptive journalism' is really just another form of trolling, it is designed to get reaction for the ""LULZ"" for free publicity and free advertising and to get people to talk about her and her blog. While I feel sad that she is targeted by trolls, not much can be done to stop it. What she is doing is no different than what the trolls do, morally and ethically, as she exaggerates the situation into being worse than it actually is (trolls are a minority of HN not the majority) so she gets more reactions for promoting her blog and name.<p>P.S. don't feed the trolls.",1356758499

I hate that there are hundreds of files out there  that have data along the lines of ""Zack Maril, Male, 21"". I'd like to find ways to prevent companies from collecting all of that information about me. (Using DuckDuckGo and cash only would probably be a great start.)",1356757304

The trouble comes when that code isn't fast enough, or should be faster.<p>How do you make Haskell code faster? Apparently it's somewhat like writing fast Java code: avoid most features, use primitive data types, and write like you're writing C. Haskell code optimized for performance ends up like messy C code more often than not, except that unsafePerformIO isn't such a prickly topic in C.<p>Even Haskell professionals often don't know when ""free"" GHC optimizations will kick in, because the optimizations can be so picky, even after you remember to apply some forgotten language pragma. Writing performant Haskell is a black art.",1356757247

When converted into USD, that is about $5 Million. So... Mr. Shark learns that he can control the market price in any direction, with approximately only $5 million USD of investment.<p>Mr. Shark's strategy therefore, is to build up enough money to ""spook"" the market by controlling it for a full day. ~100,000 BTC would be enough to crash the market for a full day: and hopefully the spooked long investors will help create the crash afterwards. Mr. Shark would then make sure the majority of his bet is in the form of a Long Straddle. Mr. Shark rides the market up till BTC has hit some absurdly high value, maybe issue a press release or two to help fuel BTC's rise.<p>One day, Mr. Shark sells 100,000 BTC all at once on the Mt. Gox market. He cashes in at BTC's high price, then BTC crashes. (EDIT: For clarification... Mr. Shark loses some money here, on purpose).<p>Mr. Shark then cashes in on his Call Options portion of his Long Straddle, and makes money because the market went down.<p>Long story short: Mr. Shark wins a ton of money, and everyone who has ""invested"" into BTC these past few weeks loses their money to Mr. Shark. Mr. Shark leaves the market without any worries that investigators will be after him. (Its not like there is a Bitcoin version of the FTC)<p>Until Mt.

5329935,comment,5328324,5329446,3,0,burkean,,,"When I read the 'science of man' and/or 'natural rights' accounts of political society and morality, I am struck my how astute Kant's critique was--that what we call conventional morality can't be found in anthropological conjecture.<p>But outside of the question of morality, his accounts of political society rest heavily on Enlightenment doctrine--it's basically a tale of the passions. That <i>was</i> the Enlightenment, not so much the rehashed civic humanism/republicanism playing itself out on the streets of Paris. And as for his infamous maxim ""Argue as much as you like, but obey"" and his specific engagement with questions about what the Enlightenment meant, I would say this is pretty much the mainstream of Enlightenment thought. Sure, sovereignty might lay with the nation, but to emphasize the will of the nation, rather than its legitimate representation, is something fairly unique to Rousseau and the hard-core of the Jacobins.<p>I know there is a body of scholarship that pins the end of the Enlightenment to Kant, but I'm not familiar with it. Could I have the elevator version?<p>Edit: Perhaps I've overstepped the mark here. I'd be interested in any recommendations that link Enlightenment to a positive discussion of virtue--ie. not a discussion of Enlightenment and 'why virtue is no longer required [compared to the classical republican polities]'.",1362556103

5329926,comment,5327247,5327247,10,0,bad_user,,,"My main gripe with Novel and now Xamarin is that they don't provide packages for Debian and Ubuntu, arguably the most popular Linux distributions.<p>For instance if you go to Mono's download page to checkout the options, the only Linux distribution supported by them is OpenSuse: <a href=""http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html</a><p>Of course one could argue that Debian (and Ubuntu that relies on Debian's repository) has a culture of packaging stuff by themselves and indeed in the case of Mono there are people that do just that. But those packages are always behind the current version and you can't blame the maintainers for that. And lots of software companies, including Google and Mozilla, are providing packages for Debian/Ubuntu for the latest versions by themselves. It's actually the norm with Ubuntu to setup third-party PPAs that provide packages for something missing from the main repository.<p>So Miguel here complains about fragmentation on the Linux desktop. It's funny, because they ignore the largest distributions around. At least if instead of OpenSuse they supported Red Hat, I would understand.<p>Also, my experience with OS X has not be so pleasant. Miguel is a damn good developer, but he must be using a really simple toolchain.<p>When you are working day-in day-out with Java, Ruby, Python, Javascript, Mysql, Postgresql, GCC, Casandra, MongoDB, Memcached and dozens of other technologies, installing that stuff and having it work on OS X is amongst the most frustrating experiences I ever had, no matter if you're doing it by hand or with MacPorts or with Homebrew. All available options on OS X suck. I couldn't give a fuck about binaries of commercial software packages working, as long as I can't manage the toolchain I depend on daily.<p>Another thing with OS X is that it just works, until it doesn't. After that you're in Windows-land again, the preferred option being to just reset/reinstall everything. Linux can be painful sometimes, but for most problems you can find documented fixes.<p>Also, he's a little out of date. Ubuntu has been rock solid for me on my Thinkpad for the last couple of months since I got my current laptop. Of course, I preferred a model with Intel HD 4000 instead of a Geforce, so a little research into hardware may be needed to ensure good compatibility, but on the other hand you can't run OS X on anything else other than a couple of Macbook models. Try building a Hackintosh sometimes and your appreciation for Linux will change.",1362555827

5329902,comment,5329730,5329730,9,0,DanBlake,,,"The biggest problem is that getting bitcoins is a major, major pain in the ass. You need to setup bank transfers, confirm your DNA and get a rectal exam to buy them from any exchange. You are looking at about a week to buy your first bitcoin from when you decide to do that. (3 days to confirm bank, 3 days to do a deposit) - This will never change for online purchases, because the way bitcoin works- there is no takey backeys (so credit card purchasing is out to buy bitcoins). So, either there will be massive fraud, or massive barrier to entry. The only way around it is retail, in person bitcoin exchanges/stores. Sort of like you see in international airports with currency exchanges.<p>Also, Even though Bitcoin cant be destroyed in a physical sense, it can still be completely devalued by litigation. The US has shown they are serious about anti-gambling and if this starts taking off, they simply need to go after the exchanges. Making it hard to buy bitcoins = BTC value goes down. Making it hard to sell (remember when pokerstars was shutdown? Everyone withdrew everything from ALL sites) and the value goes down catastrophically fast.<p>Basically, all it takes to completely devalue bitcoins is to have one event that makes most bitcoin owners think the amount of time they have to cash out is minimal.<p>How do you think the market would react if mtgox had a 'megaupload' style moment? It doesn't even have to be realistic- The US gov could just say terrorists might be using it to funnel funds or something.<p>But anyways, If mtgox was raided or taken down (and please don't say its not possible- Its totally possible) the effects on the market would be massive and instantaneous. When megaupload was taken down, all its competitors shut down out of fear as well. Its likely that would happen in this situation in a similar fashion.<p>There is no intrinsic value in bitcoins unless it is possible to easily trade them with a outcome of receiving capital. Yes you can trade bitcoins for services, but the person giving you services is not going to do that unless HE can get cash from this. People are not going to trade services/items to each other in a giant circle if the value of the currency is not hinged on a dollar amount.<p>I think the pro-bitcoin line to counter what I am saying is that someday people wont care if it converts into USD, because bitcoins will be more valuable. Its not totally bullshit- The USD is no more 'real' than a bitcoin, with the exception of it being established and backed by our gov.

It's fun in the sense that it's a challenge and provides immense satisfaction when you work out problems with it.<p>I've noticed that I get a rarely-rivaled sense of satisfaction when I see different bodies of knowledge that I've covered come together. For example, if my physics from school/uni help me solve a problem I'm facing at work, it gives a really good, satisfying feeling of mastery over the topics at hand. Deriving a solution without guidance, simply from your own existing knowledge, is a wonderful feeling.<p>The problem with this is that unless you embrace that 'inquisitive for inquisitive's sake' attitude, you don't easily justify fully exploring subjects like maths to the point of gaining that capacity. It's the same as programming, just as you touched on. Someone could be a moderate programmer if they learn what they need to spit out basic code to achieve an end goal, but you won't feel the same satisfaction of mastery as if you embrace the art and program things 'just because'.<p>The good thing is kids seem to be born with this attitude innately - just look at any young child explore the world around them. It's only really through social conditioning that it seems to be beaten out of them, as you say. Through good role models and leadership (e.g.: from teachers, parents) providing adequate material to feed that curiousity, it can be avoided.<p>It's fantastic that this kid's parents are willing to do what they did, just as your mother was willing to feed your curiousity. Understanding how significant it can be to the development of a child throughout their life is, I think, the key to fully appreciating the role that teachers (formal and informal) have in our society and why they should be valued far more than they often are at present.",1362553760

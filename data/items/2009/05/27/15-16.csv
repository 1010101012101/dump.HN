628607,comment,628532,628532,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Please allow me to quote from the article:<p>""Even C++ offers nearly everything that LISP does at this point; other than live code tree modification through macros, which aren’t anywhere near as powerful as C++’s algorithm and container library IMO, LISP has even lost the expression gap to C++ at this point.""<p>As someone who has professionally been a C++ programmer and a lisp programmer, all I can do is laugh. The reason people like lisp is the basically infinitely mutable syntax we can build to fit specific target domains. It's <i>still</i> a radically different approach that most languages don't really touch. The only places I really see the ""let's hack as a sub-language not as a framework"" approach routinely is in the Ruby and Io communities.<p>Every C++ templating approach is a trivial macro hack. And macros get nearly all the benefits of C++ templates (including static analysis).<p>As for why lisp has been left behind in favor of other languages? Well, it's pretty much the same reason as why few people in America wear bowler hats these days, they're out of fashion. That's <i>it</i>. It's history, it's fashion, there isn't any good technical reason why! Most current lisp implementations are very competitive with their peers in most arenas. There are some social issues (the lisp communities are very fragmented, which makes it difficult for beginners to get traction).<p>It is true that stripped-down languages with almost no runtime features (e.g., C, C++ when you ignore dynamic_cast, etc) can produce ""faster"" code than lisp (meaning ""does less with more lines of code, but executes quickly on modern hardware""), and that's good for them. But it's not like some kind of special privledge, _everyone_ uses C to bind into their language and make it fast. It's the native underpinnings of most modern operating systems, so this shouldn't be shocking.<p>Quoting again: \n""LISP is dead. If you really need a LISP, move to a modern LISP such as Clojure or Scala, or a modern near-lisp like Ruby. You’ll learn a lot about what LISP had kept from you.""<p>I get the strong impression that this author doesn't like lisp (he probably knows it to some degree, but not well enough to really grok it). He freely and interchangeably mentions Scala, Ruby and Clojure as ""replacements"" to lisp. Clojure aside, mentioning Scala and Ruby in this way is ludicrous, and betrays a sore lack of insight into what lisp is and what the current state of lisp technology is. Anyone who looks at PLT Scheme and SBCL and doesn't see a fairly modern and powerful system (in PLT Scheme's case with some practical and interesting work on contract-based programming), then they're <i>deliberately not looking</i>.",1243439015

Ars Technica is (at least according to Philip Greenspun) a great example of how a supposedly excellent and experienced outside CEO manages to run a company into the ground.<p>It's interesting to note that you can get a good idea of the market, the idea, and the founders ability to pull it off technically: Are they good hackers or not, do they have a working prototype, etc. But you can't really test whether they'll be able to grow the company to a multimillion dollar business. The pallette of succesful founders of software companies seems to be incredibly varied, from the arrogant but stylish Larry Ellison, over the nerdy and introvert Bill Gates to the frat boy that is Kevin Rose. I don't see many correlations that would be obvious, or even detectable, at an early stege in their careers.<p>Maybe what makes a company rise to the very top isn't the leadership but external factors. Luck basiccally. Surely a company needs good leadership, but beyond a certain baseline it probably isn't the defining factor of ultimate success.

There are all kinds of reasons why this could happen, and some of them might not need fixing.<p>It could be that the total number of people who would make excellent engineers is too low for the number needed, and that men (in your example) are more likely to make adequate or good engineers than women, even though women are more likely to make excellent ones.<p>It could be that women in general, in spite of being four times as likely to make excellent engineers, tend not to enjoy engineering for cultural or other reasons.<p>It could be that the women who would be excellent engineers are in the group that would be pretty good CEOs, and they all become CEOs because there's more money in it.<p>But you get my point: the failure of actual people to conform to the occupations that they would be best at is not, in and of itself, evidence of a problem.",1243437101

By assimilating authorship attribution information included in source files of a package, CODD approximates the the amount of individual contributions from developers who constructed the codebase. CODD also provides many tools for analysis of the attribution data. CODD was used in the First Orbiten Free Software Survey.

These sort of studies are usually undertaken at a higher, more abstract level.  eg. How do various cognitive abilities differ between sexes?  With the resulting data, we might be able to explain certain phenomena, or dispel certain stereotypes.  But I don't think we're anywhere close to being in a position we can say x out y men/women would make excellent engineers.  That kind of information is usually extracted from trend analyses (eg. studying the proportion of males/female engineers who are highly successful at their career vs those who aren't), and they're inherently skewed because of the nature of the society we live in.",1243436569

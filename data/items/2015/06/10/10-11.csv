The major share of it is manipulative and geared towards creating a need or preferences towards a particular product.<p>My argument is that, we as a society, should grew some form of resistance against such manipulations. Why? Because when a society responds to manipulation and marketing much better than the actual quality of the product, where is the incentive for the companies to improve the quality of the actual product? Hence all the efforts that should ideally go towards the creation of a better product goes into more aggressive marketing.<p>One can already see this happening with the blockbuster movies. Big studios start hyping up big releases as early as 2 years and continue to maintain the hype by releasing trailer and trailers of trailers, articles about how the director is a master of the craft and how the movie is going to be insane. But when you see the movie, it will be often mediocre. But the movie will be a hit regardless.<p>Another example. When you can influence doctors and can make then write prescriptions of your companies drug, does it make sense to spend more money improving the drug or spend a fraction of that amount, increasing marketing towards the doctors?<p>So I think if we grow more susceptible to such manipulations, the quality of things will continue to go down..",1433933561

Even opening a 10MB+ .mp3 file (for science!) didn&#x27;t result in any delay longer than a second. Whereas opening the same files on the latest Atom took a good 5 seconds for the .js and 10 seconds for the .mp3 (and it looks like Atom had to give up on doing syntax highlighting on the .js file, whereas Light Table did not). These tests were all performed on a rather modest Core M processor, so YMMV.<p>AFAIK, both Atom and Light Table are built on Electron and web technologies (Light Table uses ClojureScript but at the end of the day they both compile down to HTML/JS/CSS).<p>So my takeaway from this is: Atom&#x27;s performance woes are most likely <i>not intrinsic to the web-based platform it&#x27;s built on</i>, but are rather results of implementation flaws of Atom itself.<p><a href=""http://lighttable.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lighttable.com/</a>",1433933489

Side effects aren&#x27;t limited to filesystems, databases, etc. Here&#x27;s the very first sentence of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)</a><p>> In computer science, a function or expression is said to have a side effect if, in addition to returning a value, it also modifies some state or has an observable interaction with calling functions or the outside world.<p>Every time we call a mock, we cause observable changes (ie. we alter the results of any queries made on the mock). Therefore, calling a mock <i>is</i> a side-effect.<p>The point of mocking is to replace unwanted side-effects with harmless side-effects. The side-effects are still there, mixed in with the logic.<p>> That&#x27;s what mocks do. They capture calls and turn them into reified values that can then be manipulated and queried.<p>But mocks are only used in tests! My application can&#x27;t ask, say, a FileSystem object for a list of calls which have been made. Only my <i>tests</i> can do that, because they&#x27;re using a FileSystemMock object instead. My application can&#x27;t use a FileSystemMock since, by design, it can&#x27;t do the filesystem manipulation that I need.<p>Even if I add call-logging to the API of my FileSystem object, it doesn&#x27;t give me any control, since they&#x27;ve already happened by the time they appear in my queries.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say my application ends up with a list of effect values [e1, e2, e3, etc.] and, after performing some logic, it chooses to only return the first one: [e1].<p>How would mocks help me do this? Firstly, since this is application code rather than test code, I can&#x27;t use mocks at all. Secondly, even if I <i>could</i> perform a query to get [call1, call2, call3, etc.], there&#x27;s no way to turn that into [call1]; I can remove the <i>logs</i> of call2, call3, etc. but I can&#x27;t undo any side-effects they&#x27;ve caused.<p>To achieve the same outcome as the effect value example, I must alter the control flow of the program such that call2, call3, etc. are never made. That has nothing to do with mocking.<p>> Except that API is identical to that of whatever effect API we&#x27;re using.<p>Exactly! How is an &quot;effect API&quot; <i>not</i> a DSL for describing effects? They&#x27;re the same thing. Mocks don&#x27;t",1433932418

But even so moving the majority of JS devs to modern JS is a very slow and long process.<p>Swift may make a dent if Swift-to-JS becomes a thing, but compile-to-JS languages are mostly a failed experiment (see the lack of success of &quot;serious&quot; languages like Dart or the decline of CoffeeScript). The advantage of Babel over other to-JS compilers is that you&#x27;re just compiling JS to JS and it carries the promise that one day you won&#x27;t need the compilation step at all.<p>The &quot;JavaScript is the ASM of the Web&quot; idea, while enticing, has time and again failed to come true. I don&#x27;t think Swift can succeed where others have failed, even if it would allow iOS developers to write web apps.<p>At the risk of having to swallow my words, I don&#x27;t think Swift-in-the-browser poses any risk to JS. I also don&#x27;t think Swift-on-the-server will have a major impact, although I can imagine iOS-heavy shops wanting to use Swift when developing server APIs for their apps.<p>I agree that Apple will carry on regardless. Apple is all about controlling their ecosystems, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they try to pose Swift as an alternative to JS (much like their unilateral CSS extensions back in the day).<p>About the video: basically Douglas Crockford (of JSON fame and JSLint infamy) argues that history has proven that developers (as a whole) favour similarity over &quot;betterness&quot; when it comes to the success of programming languages. They&#x27;re more likely to pick something that is nearly exactly like what they already know than something that requires them to adjust their mental model, even if it is superior in nearly every way. The entire series is worth a watch IMO, and helps appreciating why and how JS got to the point where it is today.",1433931557

After this took the site out one too many times, we moved to at most daily releases with an hour of QA.<p>This actually made things worse. Aggressive releases were often the result of a decision further up the chain that something was ""critical"" and needed to go out right then and there. We'd got into the pattern of expecting to be able to do this at the drop of a hat.<p>So now, everyone was rushing to get the ""urgent fix"" into the daily release. This is an effective way to ship buggy software. Extra emergency releases were frowned upon, and so it introduced a level of panic that ""Oh shit, this better not screw everything up"". Ironically, with anyone releasing whenever they wanted, there was less panic because you could always make a quick fix and put it out without too many people noticing or caring.<p>We felt as a team that we'd prefer a more relaxed schedule that also allowed testing and accountability.<p>Frequent releases were a result of bad management, and unrealistic stakeholder expectations, we as developers didn't necessarily care that our code wasn't being put out immediately. Obviously, it needs to go out at some point, and we've been equally demoralised by mammoth projects that have gone on for months without a release, but that's a different end of the spectrum. The important thing is <i>regular</i> releases, not frequent ones.<p>We've now decided to move to releases every 2 weeks with a 1 week QA period. We made this decision as a team of developers, it wasn't handed down from above, it just became a necessary check for the scale of our company.<p>I personally feel a lot more productive as a result, less panicked by the quick fix you need to drop everything to fit into the daily release, and less worried that a release will take out the site.<p>But sure, it comes at a cost. There's now a lot more going out with each release and more variables that could combine to cause issues, but these issues highlight deficiencies in our QA process that can be fixed. Also, getting our team to work according to this 2 week schedule has meant some significant costs to adopt better development processes, namely SCRUM, but I feel our team has benefited enormously from it. It all depends how well your team can adapt really.<p>So yes, there are costs associated, but it doesn't necessarily lead to demotivated developers. You need to be sure that the checks are introduced properly with their own test suite. This itself has a cost but can be extremely worthwhile. A half arsed and arbitrary change to your release schedule with no process changes can destroy you, but with a little training, the right team and the right managers, you can make things better for everyone.",1228046312

380817,comment,380452,380739,0,0,flashgordon,,,"what?  100k is a car for the middle-class family?  I like to think I am middle-class and my mortage is just few (around 4) times that.  And I live in Sydney.  There is no way I (or my family rather) can afford that.  You seriously cant think that is not for the rich.<p>But that aside, that is the price of innovation.  Before being mainstreamed, all technology is expensive and trickles down from the top echelons to the bottom.  This doesnt mean that this car will always be only for the rich.<p>Secondly even if this was only for the rich, wouldnt a cleaner environmental footprint (by the supposed rich users of this car) make it a valid investment (private equity or not)?",1228045717
380816,comment,380377,380377,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"There's lots of good advice here but I want to chip in my two cents, because I was once in a very similar situation and my advice is different enough than what's already here.<p>Short backstory so you know I'm serious: In 02, I lost a client along with about $20k of unpaid work (long story), $15k in debt, NO money, my ex-boyfriend stole my car (worse than a stranger, ha - and no, I couldn't get it back), working all the time & money stress lowered my immune system, I caught a ridiculously bad case of mono and could barely sit up for 3 mos, leading my only paying client to threaten to sue me. My father couldn't help me at all with money and my mother is an evil bitch who had an extra car but wouldn't help me anyway. It sucked. It was by far the worst period of my life BUT there's a huge upside, too.<p>The first thing is: you can deal with this. You're smart, dedicated, and capable. This is just a temporary setback for you. You're already being proactive instead of wallowing in self-pity - way to go. It took me much longer to get to that stage.<p>As another commentor pointed out, only sell your things if the equivalent hourly rate works out. For most things, that's a ""no"" right now, since consumer spending is tanking. Keep your stuff. Don't pay to store it - but keep it somewhere. Unless you're like that savekaryn chick and spent it all on small, easily shifted designer purses. ;)<p>Second thing is: Call your credit card company(ies) RIGHT NOW and tell them ""Look, it's lower my interest rate or I'm going to go bankrupt."" This is the #1 mistake people in our situations make (after the racking up of debt, of course). Credit cards ARE negotiable. Allow me to repeat: CREDIT CARDS ARE NEGOTIABLE.<p>And right now, CC banks are especially vulnerable because of the shit economy and that means YOU, an actual customer who intends to make good, is GOLDEN to them. If you tell them you have no other option, they WILL lower your APR, which will do HUGE things for you.<p>If they don't respond to your approaches, try another (male?) friend or family member who can pretend to be you - who isn't feeling beaten down & can be assertive. If that fails, get a (reputable, genuine) debt counselor or lawyer. It's WELL worth the investment - it will return way more than 30% on your money.<p>Third thing is: pay off your debt quickly but DON'T KILL YOURSELF DOING IT. If you eat only ramen and work 18 hour days, you're going to be unmanageably unhappy (read: depressed, beaten down, and totally burnt out) and possibly physically ill, too. I tried both approaches, and the overworking one nearly landed me back in bed.<p>I got a f/t job - my first ever after being a freelancer since a teen, that's how low I had sunk - and that helped a lot because it greatly reduced my feeling of uncertainty. However, my first job was shitty and I was only able to stand it for 3 mos - by the end of which I'd lined up a better job and jumped to that seamlessly. Again, this falls under the category of ""don't shit all over yourself just to pay off a debt."" Better to go bankrupt, in my mind.<p>Fourth thing is: Hustle. I got my job by hustling. I got my second job, the better job I stayed with for a year to pay off my debt, by hustling. And I made extra money by hustling. What's hustling? Not anything illegal. But you've got assets, so work em!<p>What has the company gotten you? Software you developed? Know-how? SELL IT.<p>Ask EVERYONE you know if they have work for you - and, most importantly - if <i>they</i> know anyone who might have work for you. Refine your pitch, give people as concrete examples as possible. Stretch your skills to fields where you hadn't worked before.<p>Ask everyone you meet who is at least tangentially related to your work - politely - if they could use you, or know someone who does.<p>There is NOTHING wrong with this. People are reluctant to do it because it seems sketchy or exploitative, but that all depends on how you do it.<p>I got every job I ever had by asking, mostly people I had barely just met (last job paid me about $180k/yr so this is not just for small fish). You HAVE TO ASK, because most people - even ones who really could use your help - don't think about the possibilities until you do. And for the people who know you best, trust best, ask them to help you figure out ways to hustle better.<p>Now, for the rest of the know-how, consider training other people to do what you do. Consider writing an ebook or something, once you get on your feet. Your knowledge is valuable, and if you do a cursory look into the world of self-published niche topic ebooks, you'll find tons of people are making a couple extra hundred bucks a day doing it.<p>Remember that your time IS worth something - and probably quite a bit. Remember that what you do today with your time is like investing or spending your future income, too, not just for this month. This year or two or three of your life that you're going to take paying off your debt, you don't want to look back and have nothing at all to show for it but, well, less debt.<p>Invest in yourself and your future where it makes sense.<p>If you pay off your debt a bit more slowly, but stay sane and have built something that can help you in the future (an ebook or teaching web site, say), that's almost surely worth the extra interest. You just have to be sensible.<p>Also, pro tip from a girl who knows: never, ever, ever work for anybody again who won't make a 30-50% advance payment. Put kill clauses in your contract, so you keep those deposits. Otherwise you're ""putting yourself on sale"" and letting everybody know it.<p>Oh, and that upside I mentioned earlier? It's this: this is probably the worst personal situation you will ever have to deal with. And you WILL deal with it just fine. And after that, you'll realize A) how unimportant money is to your overall happiness, which paradoxically makes making money that much easier because you have its number (so to speak), and B) if you can conquer this, you can conquer ANYTHING.<p>Cheers and best of luck.<p>Amy",1228045088

If anything he's playing this the same way he played against the NBA and their officiating - by turning up the heat on himself and the matter at hand. Either he's crazy or courageous. By the way, he was right against the NBA. The officiating was corrupt for a while.<p>They absolutely did release the report when they did to limit the PR damage, especially given the meltdown in the market.",1228045024

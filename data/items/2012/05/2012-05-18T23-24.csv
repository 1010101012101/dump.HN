In fact it is so obvious now that I am kicking myself for not finding a way to make money out of it.<p>It is related to the reasoning proferred by the Atlantic, but it is not exactly it. It is true that Zynga and facebook are very related. And for that reason, it seems to me that a lot of Zynga shareholders were holding Zynga shares not because they want to own Zynga, but because they want to own Facebook and there was no way to buy Facebook on the public markets until today.<p>So a lot of Zynga shareholders were merely holding Zynga as a proxy for Facebook. Once Facebook was offered all those people decided to sell Zynga to buy Facebook. And Zynga tanked accordingly.<p>Now of course you will ask, why did Facebook seem to tank at the same time. If my theory about Zynga was true would that not mean that Facebook should go up as Zynga tanks. Yes, if all other things are equal. But in this case they were not. Facebook went down for a different reason. The reason Facebook went down is the usual immediate post IPO sell-off when a bunch of people that got into the IPO sell their shares immediately to make some quick profit.<p>So yeah, I wish I had thought about that yesterday.",1337384504

We want to make it as easy to use as Game Center on the iPhone, but for games in the physical world too. :)<p>Why do this?<p>Statistics are poorly managed and as a result people are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws.<p>We feel that Sandbag.gr sits at the nexus of several trends in the venture backed space and that now is the optimal time to enter the market with a peer-2-peer skill ranking product.<p>Big Data - For years country clubs, local athletic clubs, and student athletic associations, have kept track of sports data independently. This data, although sometimes streamlined on a national level in the case of the USGA, remains largely disorganized. There lies a huge opportunity to organize this data and apply it in a fun and intuitive way. For example, Muthu Alagappan, a Stanford University Senior, recently used a data set from the NBA 2011-2012 season on 452 players to determine which positions would best serve their strengths. In analyzing the data he created 13 new positions to better describe the way each player participates in scoring points for the team. One fun example that he pointed out was that statistically Rajon Rondo of the Boston Celtics had more in common with Miami Heat forward Shane Battier than with fellow point guard Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs. Alagappan built his database with the following fields: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocked shots, turnovers and fouls. These are stats that every athletic association in the first world keeps. The same observations that Alagappan made about professional players could be applied to the high school or adult recreational level making gameplay more fun and preventing young players from being ""undervalued"" by the coaches, scouts, and fans.  Muthu's experiment is just one example of how sports data can be utilized when organized in a standardized way. Further more, Xbox Live and Apple Game Center have data about all video games played. With the help of the unofficial Xbox API and Apple Game Center API all of this data could be ported to Sandbaggr.
Smartphone and Tablet Proliferation- There were an estimated 487 million smartphones shipped in 2011, and tablet computer proliferation is growing exponentially. Dozens of score card apps have popped up on smartphones making it easier and easier to keep score on an iPad or iPhone than in a book. This presents a phenomenal opportunity for Sandbag.gr to cater to anyone from jet setters keeping each other in line while playing a skins game on the golf course to athletic associations keeping track of their team's stats in real time on an ipad. 
Real Time - The rise of derby.js and meteor have proven that time time is ripe for a realtime consumer web applications to be deployed. Although these projects and their brethren are still in their infancy, many sports associations across the country still use traditional pen and paper as a means of keeping track. Realtime applications allow coaches and scorekeepers to update the statistics they are recording in real time, and would allow audiences, coaches, and players to engage with those statistics immediately. Although this has become commonplace for professional and college sports, game statistics methodology remains in the same state it has been since the 1950's. 
Gamification - One of the most popular buzzwords among marketing communities in lie of Four Square's success has been ""gamification."" It seems like everyone in a marketing role has been professing the inevitable gamification of western consumerism(i.e. badges for buying stuff). At Sandbag.gr we think its silly to spend time ""gamifying"" things such as shopping or watching T.V. when games and sports that people play every day and have been playing for years have not been optimized by Web 2.0 technologies. Having said that, we think the implementation of badges and awards, in a way that has been fun and successful with XBox live, would add another level of competition to sportsmanship.
p2p Meetups - We love DinnerForStrangers and think it is extremely innovative. We think the same ""matchmaking""/ ""geo-social"" principles that ideas like DinnerForStrangers and Match.com use to match people nearby can apply to pick-up games and challenges.<p>Monetization<p>Ideally we would like Sandbag.gr to be free for anyone to use, but because it is important for there to be an ultimate strategy we have brainstormed a few monetization scenarios.<p>Goods upgrades - EA made a phenomenal foray in the the internet gaming space in 2010 with the creation of Tiger Woods online which allowed users to customize their player by buying different clubs and shoes. We think that advertising and specific product upgrades in real life such as shoes and could be fun way to rack up affiliate Amazon 
Skilled Game Wagers - When handicaps are more open and honest, everyone who wants to put a friendly skilled gaming wager with a friend has the ability to do so in a safe and controlled environment.  Companies such as Betfair and . Skilled gaming betting for physical games remains largely legal within the United States and other economies.
Charge - If all else fails we think a subscription model could be viable alternative. This model has worked within the Golf Community. Currently golf rankings are kept by the USGA through a system called Golf Handicap Index Number (GHIN) although the rankings are free to view, to keep track of the rankings through your usually costs $30-50 a month through a country club. We believe we can dramatically reduce this cost (probably to zero). 
In the last five year, startups like Groupon/Living Social and fun things like StrangersForDinner have challenged us to go outside and engage socially with the world around us, but there are exists a wide range things that have yet to be modernized with the technologies that have largely democratized other aspects of daily life. There are plenty of fun things that people can do without paying for a coupon. Sport is part of our culture. We don't know why we like sports, but for some reason they're important to us. :)<p>Conclusion<p>At Sandbag.gr we're a small group of engineers, economics geeks, and entrepreneurs that want to make the world of sports and games more open and honest. We think there are huge inefficiencies throughout the world in the way we evaluate each other.<p>The list of things that we can do with well organized data is endless, but we want to start small. Right now we are developing a simple ELO ranking system that can be applied to everything from rap battles to arm wrestling (2). We think the next step are sports where handicaps play a large role like golf or bowling.<p>So sign up for the beta, ask us a question, or reach out to us and get involved to show us what you got.

By ""talking about a theoretical shortcut that allows us to not calculate everything"", I believe he means ""finding an algorithm that allows us to not have to check every possible solution in the solution-space"". Kind of how binary search is a ""clever theoretical shortcut"" to not have to check every index of an array. A lot of problems are exponential time because you end up having to check ""basically"" every possible permutation. So I think he's getting at ""finding a polynomial algorithm"" for the problem.<p>The second part then proceeds to ask whether you are considering the implications of quantum computing to this problem. I guess the answer you provided is ""no"", but now I would like to push you a little further as you want to write a website regarding this problem, and you seem to know a lot about it, and this is certainly a question I have heard a lot.

It's original owner was Avalon Hill which ultimately got bought by Hasborg where it languished before MMP licensed it. One of the really smart things MMP has done with ASL is create a series of very simple introductory subsets of ASL called Starter Kits. Many people love ASL but one of it's biggest flaws is that the total rules set is so large and complex, accumulated over many years, that historically it was very intimidating for potential new players. I don't think Curt directly designed the Starter Kits, but the fact that he was an owner and allowed and encouraged an environment and management team to do that, is a big positive mark in my book.<p>But yeah, from the sound of the article, the way they went about trying to start that video game company was completely misguided. Backwards. Cart before the horse.

Meanwhile, there is arguably no cap for fulfilling the set of user needs that make the quality of human life better, and give our civilization the ability to sustain its own existence.

I can't find any way to answer this question.  We are asking whether there is an algorithm that solves a problem in NPC in polynomial time.  I don't understand the question about a ""theoretical shortcut,"" nor what it means not to have to ""calculate everything.""

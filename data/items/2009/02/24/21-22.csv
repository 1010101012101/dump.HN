There are perfectly fine languages that don't fight you every step of the way.<p>This, btw, is the content of the front page since the site is hosed.<p>[quote]<p>Functional Java is an open source library that aims to prepare the Java programming language for the inclusion of closures. It also serves as a platform for learning functional programming concepts by introducing these concepts using a familiar language. The library is intended for use in production applications and is thoroughly tested using the technique of automated specification-based testing with ScalaCheck.<p>Functional Java currently includes the following algebraic structures:<p><pre><code>    * Immutable, in-memory singly linked list (fj.data.List)\n    * Immutable lazy singly linked list (fj.data.Stream)\n    * Array wrapper (fj.data.Array)\n    * Optional value type-safe null (fj.data.Option)\n    * Disjoint union a superset of exception handling (fj.data.Either)\n    * Monoid (fj.pre.Monoid)\n    * Functions with arity 1 to 8 usable with Java 7 closure syntax\n    * Products of 1 to 8\n</code></pre>\nFunctional Java now includes the Reductio automated specification-based testing framework.<p>Functional Java includes usage examples and notably, code examples that make use of the Java 7 BGGA proposal syntax. Here is one such example (import statements omitted) that maps a transformation across an array by adding 42 to each element.<p><pre><code>      final Array<Integer> a = array(1, 2, 3);\n      final Array<Integer> b = a.map({int i => i + 42});\n      arrayShow(intShow).println(b); // {43,44,45}</code></pre>\n[/quote]",1235512204

But of course they are actually only flourishing in a small number of spots. I've worked with a few of these programs, and some are led by extremely talented and skilled administrators. And they're well funded. Is your premise that direct involvement like this will not work but that indirect involvement would?

The program would be sponsored by a VC firm and provide support, networking, and possibly (but not necessarily) funding. The VC firm would mentor the entrepreneur while he launched startups for a minimum of 12 years. At the end of the program, he would have the option of a job at the VC firm.

Adjusted for 3% inflation, the fees would be something like:<p><pre><code>  Year  Fee/yr\n  1     $1\n  10    $5.71\n  25    $104.17\n  50    $13,169\n  100   $210 million\n  150   $3.36 trillion\n</code></pre>\nThis would put a natural limit on corporate copyright, due to their willingness to pay. With this system, Disney would pay $5,659,799 this year for the Mickey Mouse copyright (assuming it started at 10 cents in 1928, which is assuming 3% inflation backwards from now). By 2033 this would be a billion dollars a year... by 2064 a trillion. (Again, at 3% inflation, a trillion dollars in 2064 is like $200 billion today).",1235509937

A conference provides a forum for meeting people, but I feel that most of the time the value of any venue is perceived solely in terms of its reputation (and hence impact on CV), and as you point out this is no guarantee that your paper has actually been reviewed by someone knowledgeable.",1235509535

Besides that, IE8's private browsing mode automatically blocks Google Analytics and similar tracking services (and ad networks?). Look for that to be increasingly common in web browsers that care more about the end user than they care about advertisers.<p>By the way, what was ""broken""? In this case, everything worked out fairly well for everybody except the website owner and Google, who are likely indifferent to the negative result. Google Analytics doesn't provide any functionality to the user so it doesn't matter to him if the script fails to load or not. The page probably loaded a little faster and his web browser is probably using a little less memory. He probably also got to preserve just a <i>little</i> bit more privacy. The IT team that deployed the firewall got paid to do so and plus they can feel good knowing that their firewall is probably blocking some <i>actual</i> XSS attempts. That reduces IT costs for the company. The manufacturer likely got paid a lot of money for the firewall and the sales guy probably made a nice commission on it.",1235509517

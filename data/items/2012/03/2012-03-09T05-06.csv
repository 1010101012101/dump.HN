Says ""We didn't like the alternatives out there."" with no details.<p>Having said that, it looks like the HTTP server is the USP here. Being able to have non-techies run Fabric tasks is definitely a goal that's passed me fleetingly in the night. So, add this to Fabric and we're good.<p>EDIT: The author, Dan Lecocq is near me in Seattle so, what with it being a small world and all, I just wrote to him (in case he's not the author of this thread) via his blog to ask him what he didn't like about Fabric, and suggested he respond here.",1331272795
3683100,comment,3682470,3682627,1,0,WildUtah,,,"Does that happen because Haskell has significant whitespace? I suppose you might get used to the way it requires you to line things up and come to like it.<p><pre><code>    (let 
       ((a b)
         (c d))
       foo)
</code></pre>
Seems odd to me because the (a b) and (c d) are semantically the same but can't line up. Or, they can't line up without spending a new line on each function call, as if this were Java or something.<p>Don't worry; I know Haskell isn't Java-like. (Haskell is Python plus Perl: Significant whitespace plus polymorphism based on external context of the expression. Written in the APL charset.)",1331272745

You could get a place twice as big for the same money, at a very central location, in a brand new building.<p>Hell, you could get a bigger place for much LESS.  My friend just rented a brand new place in Shibuya for 95000 a month, with beautiful interior, entryway, super-modern shower/bath, gas range, ample space for a proper washing machine, and the main living space is separated from everything else by a heavy door.  The whole building is built from such heavy concrete that there is no worry about bothering/being bothered by the neighbors.<p>This is utterly standard.  I hope some day soon the US figures out how to build similarly awesome but affordable buildings.",1331270524

3683019,comment,3682890,3682890,25,0,zcid,,,"LSD is also known for it's use in treating migraines (about a 1/4 of a recreational dose is effective). I used to keep a supply for this purpose as I was unable to afford the prescription drugs that provide me relief. Unfortunately, LSD carries such a heavy penalty that I no longer do this and usually just shut myself in a dark room for a day or two when I get migraines. I'm lucky that I get them very rarely as opposed to those that get them monthly or even weekly.<p>I remember a short blurb in a Cary Grant [auto?]biography about his use of the drug in therapy and how it changed his life and perspective for the better.<p>It bothers me that a drug like this is so demonized that its possible therapeutic values are almost completely ignored. I know that there are some researchers still doing work in the area, but they are very few due to the huge legal obstacles at the federal levels.<p>I see this as just one more area where prohibition has harmed us. It's so sad that science has become subject to government after so many hundreds of years working to free it from the yoke of religion.<p>Edit: BTW, LSD is listed as a Schedule I drug (the most serious according to US law) and is listed with other such threats as MDMA, heroin, and mankind's worst enemy: Marijuana. It also carries a life sentence in federal prison upon a second trafficking offense.",1331270124

You can do even better in the outer mission or Ocean View / Taraval (near CCSF), and quite fine in the southwestern corner by the main UCSF campus. Mission Bay students have it a little harder if they're not in on-campus housing - perhaps somewhere in the Bayview? Of course, Mission Bay campus is a short walk from the Caltrain depot, as well, and the transfer to a streetcar from BART is doable.<p>I still suspect that apartment is for PARTYING PARTYING every night and living the Bohemian lifestyle where you're mostly in your place to sleep and <i>occasionally</i> study.

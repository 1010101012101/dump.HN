IMO that's worth the tradeoff, but if you feel differently, then don't bother with Connect (though I'm curious what concrete concerns you have, more specific than just ""opening them up to even more tracking"").</i><p>As a user: My integrity. I don't want to link accounts on otherwise completely different services. You have no business in knowing what other services I use and I see no, absolutely no, advantages to being <i>forced</i> to use facebook connect. As an alternative? Sure! But exclusively? No. You fail to mention the advantages with using facebook connect so I would really hesitate to call it a tradeoff when you have nothing to gain...<p>And as a user I'm not free not to use it... And facebook haven't exactly had a solid track uptime record, it has even deserved a poor reputation in that regard - sure it isn't that bad but thing with relying on external parties is that it can <i>only</i> get worse than handling it yourself.<p><a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/193423/facebooks_sneaky_apps_and_privacy_issues.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/193423/facebooks_sneaky_apps_...</a><p><i>Perhaps it's not that hard, but many still people fail to do it properly. And it's still not a silver bullet - even properly hashed passwords, when exposed from a compromised DB, can be reversed. Regardless, this is only a small part of the problem - dealing with stolen (e.g. phished) credentials is another, arguably more important, problem that's much more difficult.</i><p>The problem isn't, and has <i>never</i> been, that it is hard. The issue at hand is incompetence in its purest form and nothing else. And such incompetence will bite you in the ass regardless. Sure, I'd prefer my password not leaking but just deriving your password from the domain name or something like that is simple enough to combat that. In any case <i>that</i> is a tradeoff that isn't hard to make.<p>External dependencies is not only something a developer has to take into consideration, as a user you have to keep track of permissions, ever changing security settings - but for what? If I don't want to link my music usage to my facebook account what possible can I gain from using facebook connect? Seriously? Have you guys even considered that scenario? Of course you have, you just couldn't give a shit about your users privacy or concerns. Rather make an easy buck than creating a good platform, just don't pretend you try to do both.<p>You can't seriously argue that having to deal with all that shit is easier than signing up for a new account for every service.<p><i>Please don't do that. We're pretty aggressive about proactively seeking out fake accounts and getting rid of them, and as a result I imagine this would end up being a pain in the ass for you. I'm curious what threat this mitigates?</i><p>Even spotify recommends you to create an empty account ;) There is nothing you can do to stop me and the huge relief for my ass would be to not being afraid of spamming my friends with my spotify usage, not having to even <i>care</i> how spotify/whatever uses my facebook account (and how facebook/services will handle this in the future, facebook has a terrible reputation of adding new options with questionable defaults). Is it so hard to grasp that these are valid concerns? <i>Valid concerns that should never, in anyones wildest dreams, ever have existed.</i><p>There is <i>nothing</i> of value you can offer me but there are countless ways you can annoy the shit out of me. Solution? Create dummy facebook accounts. It is the <i>only</i> solution to the problem that you have created - suit yourselves.<p>I don't trust facebook and I don't trust anyone else having any form of access to my facebook account (also, I'm so old fashioned that I don't even run executables that I get in the mail of an unknown sender).

In Haskell, you'd introduce a type for each purpose to encode your intent in a way the compiler understands</i><p>But then in Ruby if you want to you can encapsulate behaviour and your intent in objects instead of types - as concepts become more complex, you may introduce an object which encapsulates the data and provides checked interfaces for it. Taking the example of a telephone number, you might define a PhoneNumber Class in Ruby which encodes your intent and enforces an interface in much the same way as a Type in Haskell might (?), but if your use of telephone numbers is simply as an unformatted string, you don't have to introduce that complication initially. A static typing system is not the only way to encode that sort of information is it?<p>I do find the example above somewhat puzzling, as idiomatic ruby would be more like foo.bar if you want the value of bar (which should have an accessor defined if you are allowed to read it). What I was hoping for was an example of the two languages side by side demonstrating some small mistake which leads to errors or unintended consequences because of a lack of static typing in Ruby.<p>If you're counting no method errors as type errors then I must hang my head in shame :) Usually those are caught before going into production though by either unit tests or normal testing. You catch typos (with or without strong typing) on compilation in a compiled language, but you have to catch them with testing at runtime in an interpreted one. But is that really related to static typing or compiled versus interpreted?<p>I'm intrigued by the enforced types of Haskell though, so this article is an interesting starting point in the comparison, and thanks for trying to explain it.",1335529325

It's not a rational thing<p>I've had some thoughts on this recently, and wholeheartedly disagree. We spend aeons engineering stability into every other interface within a software ecosystem, since it's supposed to improve stability, reduce surprising breakage, improve engineer efficiency, discoverability, etc., but when it comes to interfaces in the <i>user plane</i>, it's like the only established methodology is FUCK YOU Driven Development.<p>In these systems, and Gmail, the user is not considered an intelligent, complex actor in the system, but instead something more like a child sitting in a cinema whose only criteria for synchrony is to be repeatedly dazzled by confounding changes to the way it interacts with the system.<p>This is fundamentally wrong in so many ways. Not least, the user is <i>the</i> main purpose for the existence of these systems (er, right??), and yet the user's interface to the system is the one most likely to <i>functionally break without warning</i>.<p>You cannot address the reliability of the entire system without considering the last mile - dropping a change the size of the Gmail redesign on millions of users without a multitude of small iterations, or with a huge amount of fanfare and warning, is an unmitigated disaster for the reliability and efficiency of the overall system.<p>I don't give 2 fucks how much of the scientific method was abused to create the new system up to that point, if it doesn't comfortably fit the millions of delicate tendrils that have grown between my mind and it, then from the user's perspective the change is much closer to an abject failure.<p>I suspect in years to come this will be an increasingly important area for study, and I pray the outcome to some extent will simply be that corporations will need to give up achieving quick feel-good wins by arbitrarily fucking with the user-machine interface, although I could be wrong. We could always be further reduced to that mindless entertainment-only child in the cinema, responsible only for the most basic direction of the outcomes of our interaction with the overall system, the tacit attitude of the large corporations as they drop huge changes like this without warning.<p>The outcry we hear over these changes isn't just bored people being picky, it's the sound of a trillion dying neurons in a million interconnected biological systems. Much as a fully grown cat wouldn't fare well being stuffed into a jar, the users here suffer just the same. Thin the cat's diet slowly over time, widen a border here, replace some text with an icon there, and the small bits of death and shrinkage that occur over time will mean that cat will soon be ready to contentedly purr its way into that jar and fall into a dreamy slumber all of its own accord.",1335529079

What constitutes a collective work is basically what a person on the street would call a collective work, after they answer the first question. (That is, if you start here they might say an album is one work, but if you get them to agree that a song is one thing once they probably won't say that.) What constitutes copying is basically what a person on the street would agree is copying. That certainly isn't good enough advice to go off of if you're going to try to build a business off of it or something, and edge cases abound, but the core concepts aren't anywhere near as screwed up as you might think.

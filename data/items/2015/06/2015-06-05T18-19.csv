Several of them were during &quot;autonomous&quot; mode but are incidents in which another car is described as hitting the vehicle. Arguably, none of the &quot;manual&quot; mode accidents were egregiously the fault of Google.<p>However, I think the definition of &quot;caused&quot; will be debate here and for years to come. In one Feb. 2015 incident, the autonomous Google car is struck in the side rear by a car that rolled through a crossbound stop sign. The Google car is described as &quot;Applying the brakes in response to its detection of the other vehicle&#x27;s speed and trajectory&quot;...since the collision ended up happening anyway, and it hit the <i>rear</i> of the Google car...doesn&#x27;t that imply that if the Google car <i>hadn&#x27;t</i> cautiously applied the brakes while going through the intersection, it would have cleared the intersection without getting hit? Also worth noting: the Google human driver tried to take control during the autobrake sequence...so it&#x27;s possible that his/her reaction and manual braking was what led to the rear collision.",1433530317

9667275,comment,9663343,9666988,0,0,pron,,,"> I want to form a mental model of what code I should write to get a certain effect<p>And how do you do that with hyperthreading, virtual memory, power management that may decide to power down your core because what you&#x27;re doing doesn&#x27;t seem important enough (and that differs greatly from one processor to another) and cache effects on code, data and TLB (all are strongly affected by other threads and processes running on your machine[1])?<p>While those effects didn&#x27;t exist much before the 90s, and they don&#x27;t exist today in GPUs and small embedded devices, on desktops and servers those effects may be much greater in magnitude than any difference you&#x27;re able to get by better control over generated code. Not running a hypervisor, turning off virtual memory, pinning threads and isolating cores have a much more profound effect on predictability than which language or compiler you&#x27;re using. Focusing on compilation before taking care of those much more powerful sources of unpredictability is like trying to get a faster car by reducing the weight of the upholstery fabric.<p>> so that a program that runs fine today might be unusably slow tomorrow.<p>I think that slowdown actually applies to assembly programs much more than to, say, Java. As CPU architecture changes, it&#x27;s actually easier to keep higher-level code performant. I mean, why do you assume that compiler changes will hurt your code performance more than CPU changes?<p>> You can still have an LLVM-smart compiler underneath but you get to make the first pass.<p>There are many ways to produce good machine code (my favorite is Graal, HotSpot&#x27;s next-gen JIT), but none of them really give you a good mental model of what&#x27;s going on. You may like one approach over another for personal aesthetic reasons, one approach may actually produce better results for some workloads than others, and some approaches really are <i>more</i> predictable -- but no approach produces categorically predictable results, and more predictability doesn&#x27;t buy you better performance (though it still requires more effort).<p>It used to be that if you knew what instructions your compiler would emit, you knew how your program would perform. That is just no longer the case (well, it is to some degree, but other effects are stronger). A single instruction may perform anywhere within 7 orders of magnitude (L1 cache hit to virtual memory miss) depending on effects outside the program&#x27;s control! (of course, those high-volatility costs are usually amortized, but so is a less unpredictable compiler output).<p>[1]: That is the key to cryptographic attacks that let a process sense what a cryptography algorithm running in another process is doing by the way the cryptographic computation affects the performance of the first process.",1433530306

The situation is in reality quite complicated and there are far more choices than &quot;do what you love and be bankrupt&quot; and &quot;do what you hate and make money&quot;, and, for once, the complication works out in your favor.<p>Job seekers: Make a <i>list</i> of your interests and talents. If you don&#x27;t have a list, either think harder, or start trying some new things, <i>stat</i>. Order them vaguely by how much you like them. Now, go down the list, look out in the world, and ask what kind of living you can <i>expect</i> to make with that skill/talent/interest. Be realistic; for example, some musicians may make millions upon millions, but the median outcome is fairly poor. And be realistic about your level of talent/interest/dedication.<p>Most people really ought to be able to find something that is both at least sort of interesting and at least sort of economically viable. After all, in the US, even &quot;median&quot; income is a pretty good outcome, especially if you don&#x27;t hate your job.<p>I practice what I preach. Technically, in a perfectly-aligned-for-jerf world, computer programmer is my <i>second</i> choice of job. My first-place job would be a music composer, preferably for games. (That&#x27;s not just because &quot;games are cool&quot;, but I actually like the idea of trying to create soundtracks that match up with the desired moods, and especially at the time games had much more interesting soundtracks than movies.) However, a sober and realistic examination of my skills, interests, and talents, matched up with my assessment of a rather high likelihood of <i>total failure</i> as a musician, along with the incredibly small number of slots available even under the best of circumstances, led me to discard that option, no matter how passionate about it I was. Everything in the 15 years since I graduated with my computer science degree has only reinforced my belief that I would have been a miserable economic failure as a composer.

We would all tell you that most organizations, even (maybe especially) the largest ones, are absolutely horrible at having any idea whatsoever of the impact of their programs.

It doesn&#x27;t matter as much when things are buzzing, but it becomes important during downturns like after 2000 or after 2008.<p>It is rare to meet someone without a BSCS who can explain what a finite state automata is, or how you can prove a problem is NP-complete through reductions, and that sort of thing.  Or even with less theoretical topics, they&#x27;re less likely to know what second normal form is, or semaphore P&V&#x27;s etc.<p>Of course there are different scenarios and exceptions to every rule.  Some people get a diploma while doing the minimum.  Some people are superstars and learn theory without a diploma.  People can get jobs without a diploma, especially in boom times.<p>I would go back again to the economic downturns.  In 2000 a lot of companies went under and people were let go.  The same happened in 2008.  You might be laid off, and will then be competing for a very limited number of jobs against people with as much experience as you, plus diplomas.  You might think it might not matter, and some other people might tell you that doesn&#x27;t matter, but that won&#x27;t be much help when you&#x27;re laid off, have a family to support and mortgage to pay, and job listings say like the above ad &quot;Bachelors...requirement&quot;.

I can even see someone out of necessity cutting school down to one night/weekend class a week.  For a young person to go into development without pursuing a Bachelors seems very risky to me.  You&#x27;ll be the first one thrown into the scrap heap when the economy sours, and by that time you might have a family to support.  You don&#x27;t want to have the realization you need a Bachelors when you&#x27;re 35 with a family - between work, family and study you&#x27;ll have no time at all.",1433528133

This can be used to provide all sorts of conveniences.<p>With a plain JSON-based API, you copy and paste field names out of sample code or the documentation.  If you spell a field name wrong, there will be no error on the client.  If you&#x27;re lucky, the server <i>might</i> error out because it didn&#x27;t recognize the property name, but it also might not.  If you send an integer when the server was expecting a string, the server might automatically convert or it might not.<p>With protobuf, the schema is explicit in a .proto file.  That means that the client library can tell you, at the precise moment that you say msg.misspledFieldName, that the field name doesn&#x27;t exist.  Or if you try to put an integer in there instead of a string, it can tell you about that too.  Basically it makes for a tighter feedback loop, which is almost always better.<p>In statically-typed languages like C++ or Java, the schema can be used to generate static types too, so it&#x27;s actually a <i>compile-time</i> error when you misspell a field name.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t matter what what programming language or OS I am on, there is almost always a built-in library that de/serialize JSONs at reasonable speed.<p>Yep, that&#x27;s one reason that proto3 will support JSON as a first-class citizen: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#j...</a>",1433527548

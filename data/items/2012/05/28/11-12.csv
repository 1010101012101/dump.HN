Do only people call there who do not like the chart stuff coming from the US or sounding like the usual mainstream? Or do maybe really less people like the music that is played on the radio?<p>For me, I don't call for any shows on TV. In this case I would have propably called for the russian babuszkas because they were funny. I don't like the stuff that german mainstream radios play here and most of the songs on the usual chartlists are crap in my eyes (or ears). So I can't really make up a solution by myself.",1338206393

It's not a one-dimensional continuum, either - places like Berlin have cheap cost of living _and_ a fantastic nightlife, but government bureaucracy makes it more inconvenient for small businesses here.<p>It's funny how these pockets of win always seem to work out by chance and circumstance.<p>In another decade, governments will be playing this game with tax laws for information workers, too.

4032946,comment,4031788,4031788,1,0,betawolf33,,,"A very interesting read.<p>I found that Harris' argument was more immediately graspable and intuitive (There's a higher risk of an Arabic-looking passenger being a terrorist [though that's _higher_, not _high_], so check them more than others) but Bruce's analysis was far more convincing in the end due to the way he laid out his cost-benefit analysis.<p>Bruce did a good job at mostly avoiding emotional appeals to a sense of fairness and focused on the efficacy of the system in practical terms. The argument from simplicity is a strong one. However, he does seem to miss some points he should've addressed, especially right at the end where Harris challenges him on why randomness isn't more generally applicable, if Bruce thinks it's the best approach here. While I don't think it's a devastating point, I think it needed a reply, and I think Bruce did a bit of the 'repeating yourself without listening' approach.<p>Harris is mostly rational and objective about the risk of Muslim passenger. However, he occasionally strays into making what I feel are unfair generalisations. At one point he gestulates about 'what other religion does X Y Z now'. I immediately thought of the Christian extremist groups in America. It seems his view of the number of Muslims who are in favour of or are not against terrorist is a bit skewed.",1338206218

This is one of the few good things I have to say about Apple's account management; the competition generally don't allow changing country at all (I'm looking at you, Microsoft).<p>I used to do this all the time, before I got completely fed up with Apple and decided to have nothing more to do with them. I purchased music from the US, UK and German iTunes stores, all on the same account. (I lead, perhaps, a somewhat more international life than many.) It works rather less well in the brave new iCloud world, as the (relatively) new 'redownload previously purchased content' functionality will only show you content from the country you're currently set to.<p>(</i>) Or rather you could, because there's now a honking great caveat: you cannot change country if you have an active iTunes Match subscription.",1338204223

Any feedback would be much appreciated!  Here's the overview link:<p>https://digitsend.com/product-tour<p>My problem with the existing solutions is that if I need to send sensitive data to somebody, I generally have to set up an account for them and communicate a temporary password.  Because sending the temporary password over email defeats the purpose, I wind up calling them and the whole process takes longer than it should.<p>With this, the sender just types the email and enters the receiver's phone number.  A link is emailed to the receiver.  When the receiver goes to read it, the website calls them.  Once verified, the receiver can choose a password and log in sans-phone in the future.<p>So it's basically send-and-forget for the sender, and a two-factor, one-time registration process for the receiver.",1338204081

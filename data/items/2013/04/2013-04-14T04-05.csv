Obviously the box sizes and positioning mean something.<p>What I can see makes me a bit curious.<p>- Frontend Web boxes are ""big"", where the (some) of the backend App boxes are small. I'd have though it would be the reverse -- frontend horizontally scaled first, backend vertically scaled first.<p>- Sometimes they use Zones ABC, sometimes AB. This is cool, but a lot of the ""front"" infrastructure is AB (including www), so not sure what advantage having ABC on backend pieces are. These are obviously super-critical for some special reason? I guess they also might be pieces that are-not/only-partially replicated to the secondary site.<p>- The failover US-West site is using Asgard along with Puppet, but the primary US-East one isn't. I guess this is for managing failure scenarios?<p>- Prodigious use of a lot of AWS services. Including internal ELBs all over the place. SQL Server and PostgreSQL sneak in a few places.<p>- Couldn't find the CDN!<p>- Looks like staging and testing are a complete replica (hard to tell, the resolution isn't quite there).

5545919,comment,5543712,5543712,1,0,gibbitz,,,"I do understand the difficulty of testing private code in tools like jasmine when you use private variables based on publicly unreachable scopes. When I have to do this, I add a debug object with references to the code. Generally, this code should affect publicly accessible methods and those are more important to test. If they fail, decent in-browser tools like breakpoints and watch lists should reveal the error.<p>I'm not completely ready to call this an anti-pattern. There's no reason to expose local methods of an Object to the parent scope if they aren't needed. I'm sure that in some cases this could cause the memory footprint of an Object to be larger than desired by preventing garbage collection. Anyway, I would have factored your code more like this:<p><pre><code>  var PseudoClass = function(_args){
      // guarantee that ""this"" is what we expect
      if( this === window ){ // use global for non-browser    implementations
         return new PseudoClass(_args);
      }
      // private variables are local
      var private = function() {;
             this.value = 2; 
          };
      // public variables are on prototype 
      this.constructor.prototype.value = 1; // I'd prolly use a local var and a getter for this
      this.constructor.prototype.public = function(){
          private.call(this); // force scope for private methods
      };
      // testing access (only added when necessary)
      this.constructor.prototype.privateMembers = {
          ""private"":function(){ private.call(this) }
      };
    };
</code></pre>
There's no ""self"" here, but there are two pieces of insurance around scope. 
First is the condition that forces the ""new"" keyword. (This could be written to test against instanceof the function name, but generally problems occur when users forget new, not when they force the scope to be wrong. Last I checked, this is how jQuery tests it too.) 
Second is calling the private methods with the call() method of the function, allowing us to keep the scope from defaulting to global/window. Sure, you are forced to put these in to avoid errors, but this is programming. If you would like it to throw an error when this === window within private(), just add it. I didn't because a) I'm lazy and b) once the PseudoClass private methods are all called, I would end up removing the un-thrown errors and the privateMembers property before compressing for staging/production to keep size down.<p>Using a variable like ""self"" is quite clear in this context and I've seen it done thousands of times. I just wanted to show that using ""this"" is still possible.<p>Javascript is a funny language. I often find myself wondering if this was the intended structure of the language as it takes advantage of many of the key elements (closure scopes & prototype) while abstractly appearing like simple Java (or C#). Sure in a perfect world, the wrangling of ""this"" wouldn't need to be done. I'd say the unpredictable value of ""this"" in different contexts is the biggest fail of Javascript. I programmed ActionScript (including AS1) for many years and this (pun intended) is the biggest mindf*ck I've come across when regarding them in comparison (considering they're both based on ECMA script).

5545857,comment,5545535,5545796,9,0,waps,,,"Well, frankly, looking at actual genetic code, one can't help but find it rather ... organised. You know, being produced by a randomized search algorithm and all, one doesn't really expect so many features.<p>Everybody knows about telomeres, the ""death clock"". But there's more. Every gene has a preamble, most of which is not understood. Some of it is known to encode parameters along the lines of ""if you detect substance X, copy this gene"", with hundreds of variations and parameters in there (like the concentration to be detected for example). It is also known that it is possible to have AND and OR relations in these preambles, and one preamble can refer to another, by name (not by position in genes). This is followed by a small set of instructions meant for the ribosome (the easiest of which is along the lines of ""stop after X number of basepair-triples are processed, do not continue to the end of the gene""), then the start codon ""ATG"" (for all plants and animals, bacteria and organella use others), and then the gene itself, the thing that contains actual instructions to build proteins, followed by a stop codon, of which many variations exist. Then there is a post-amble of the gene also meant for the ribosome (instructions like ""export this resulting protein to the outside of the cell"", as opposed to releasing it inside the cell, and this contains a wait timer, and a death timer).<p>So what our DNA does is send programs to ribosomes that are generally along the following lines :<p><pre><code>  1) n = 0; stop_after_codons = $X; modifiers = $Y
  2) transcribe (taking modifiers and stop_after_codons into account) until you hit the stop codon
  3) while $TIMER, hold on and do nothing
  4) if $EXPORT request a cell membrane to envelop the protein and make it leave the cell (and a hundred more of these modifiers)
  5) n+=1; if n < $X goto 1 (by releasing the RNA chain. it'll quickly get picked up again by this ribosome or another and restart the program), else destroy the RNA chain by making it's central half-helix collapse
</code></pre>
Note that this is the very lowest level of structure that is inside the DNA. There is very distinct highlevel organisation as well, we just don't understand it at all. This is also not the lowest level of structure inside an eukaryot cell, as the ribisomes/mitochondria/... also have internal DNA and are executing complex programs themselves, and our DNA is just one of the parameters they work with.<p>This is, frankly, not at all how I'd expect the result of a genetic algorithm to look like (referring to the AI concept of genetic algorithm). Genetic algorithm outputs/programs can be generally summarized as working as follows :<p><pre><code>  1) poewuiqfawer;awe;rj;l // Non-sense, but usually a NOP that jumps to position 2
  2) take the data xor with some weird value
  3) jump to random location in the gene on some condition
  4) jump to random location in the gene on some condition
  5) result = value and 2309823141
  6) op8uqwerawe;jkasdfaser // Non-sense
  7) jump to random location in the gene on some condition
  8) q[3452345g23421dad // Non-sense
  9) jump to random location in the gene on some condition
  10) take position 3+8*n-5 in the data, add 5, and xor the value at the resulting location with 290138472134
</code></pre>
Let's call it ""horror-basic"". Spaghetti code doesn't quite cover just how much spaghetti there is here. You'd think there'd be a lot of difference between programs that implement different functions, but when you don't understand what the hell it's doing all programs look alike. While I have seen once or twice things that looked like a basic structure in the result of a genetic algorithm, it's extremely rare, and certainly nothing as pervasive as you see in the human genome.<p>Programs like this example then somehow manage to calculate uncalculatable functions, or find something in an image, or they produce instructions that you can send to robot legs that make them go forward.<p>This could, of course, be a difference in complexity. Nobody's ever run a genetic algorithm for more than a few months, and the genetic algorithm we think operates life has been operating for ~4 billion years. Still, our DNA, frankly, looks like a medium-size (certainly no more than 10k-50k lines of code<i>) program that has been compiled from a much higher level programming language. I'm not saying it's not written by a genetic algorithm, and genetic algorithms are famous for taking bloody long to do even the most basic things, but ... I'd like to see this genetic algorithm's implementation, because it's a lot more complex than just duplicate, mutate, evaluate fitness. And it's output is remarkably better than anything I've ever come up with. It looks very LISPy in the sense that the DNA's basic operating principle is to rewrite a highlevel program into a slightly lower level program, and then rewrite the lower level program, and then rewrite it again into a protein (and then let physics ""rewrite"" those proteins into things like human beings).<p></i> not including all the organelle programs it depends on",1365912592

You have two billiard balls; one is red, one is green, but they are otherwise identical. To your friend they seem completely identical, and he is skeptical that they are actually distinguishable. You want to prove to him (I say ""him"" as most color-blind people are male) that they are in fact differently-colored. On the other hand, you do not want him to learn which is red and which is green.<p>Here is the proof system. You give the two balls to your friend so that he is holding one in each hand. You can see the balls at this point, but you don't tell him which is which. Your friend then puts both hands behind his back. Next, he either switches the balls between his hands, or leaves them be, with probability 1/2 each. Finally, he brings them out from behind his back. You now have to ""guess"" whether or not he switched the balls.<p>By looking at their colors, you can of course say with certainty whether or not he switched them. On the other hand, if they were the same color and hence indistinguishable, there is no way you could guess correctly with probability higher than 1/2.<p>If you and your friend repeat this ""proof"" t times (for large t), your friend should become convinced that the balls are indeed differently colored; otherwise, the probability that you would have succeeded at identifying all the switch/non-switches is at most 2t. Furthermore, the proof is ""zero-knowledge"" because your friend never learns which ball is green and which is red; indeed, he gains no knowledge about how to distinguish the balls.",1365912325

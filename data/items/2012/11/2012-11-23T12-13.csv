Your average fellow will disavow such an idea, even if it comes with good health all the way. Oh no, they will say, why would anyone want to live for such a time. I'll be glad to go.</i><p>I don't think this is so. People cling to life to extreme measures. What they don't like is the actual process of aging, losing relatives and friends, their health, and so on.<p>That affects what they respond to even if you ask them about ""extending the healthy human life span"" even if it comes with good health all the way, because the pain of aging is real, whereas the ""good health all the way"" thing they know to be a pipe-dream.<p>If you could demonstrably show them the ""extension + good health all the way"" they would JUMP at it. Especially if it could include their loved ones too (people don't merely want to live, like some primitive organism, they want to live with a certain quality and in certain company).",1353675518

4822000,comment,4821183,4821183,1,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"> Isn't it compulsory to hash user passwords, as otherwise it would be a severe user data compromise? What should be done in this case?<p>No. It is not. There is no legal compulsion to hash passwords. I believe Visa and Mastercard do require their vendors to do so however or risk losing their ability to process credit card payments. I also think that there is some US healthcare law that somewhat requires it.<p>But in general there is no legal requirement to hash passwords. The lack of hashed passwords doesn't mean that there is a ""user data compromise"" within its own right.<p>The reason companies hash passwords is so that if they ever get broken into that it means the bad guy has to spend several days or weeks breaking the password database which gives the company time to notify the users and the users time to change their passwords.<p>Note: A lot of compromises go unnoticed and in those situations hashing offers little additional security (since the bad guy has infinity to crack the passwords).<p>Note #2: Hashing also makes implementation easier since the length of passwords becomes uniform and you essentially eliminate things like SQL injection (since the raw password is never stored in the database).",1353674196

I'm not sure if that was ever done at scale for GW testing, but it would have been possible...<p>My understanding is that the replays were possible because the game engine was architected from the beginning with the server 100% in control of game events and the clients relying on message-passing to communicate with the server. This means that the recording captured on the server is a definitive recording of what actually happened in the game. Clients could desync, so a replay might not reproduce that, but otherwise they were pretty accurate.<p>I'm not sure how the unchanging content problem was solved. I think everything was revision-controlled aggressively enough that it would have been possible to set up a local server instance using old content, and it's also possible that most ordinary changes (altering a texture, a map, etc) wouldn't actually change the results of a replay. Definitely a challenge, though.<p>Replays came in handy later on for other features (like letting players watch others' PvP matches in-game) so they probably ended up carrying their weight in terms of development effort.

4821958,comment,4821475,4821475,3,0,hythloday,,,"Always enjoy these articles. I do think that the simulation strategy deserves a bit more discussion, and the pitfalls of replays are glossed over slightly.<p>Simulating players gives you the benefit of end-to-end testing much more easily (for example, it tests your login flow and disconnect flow, both of which are often written without much care for performance). It also practically demands that you write a scripting console for your game, which is an invaluable resource for error testing, debugging and development both by your engine and content developers. It's true that human players are more unpredictable than bots, but that's not a drawback, because you want to stress-test the hottest part of your game. For these purposes, you can write a small test level (think an arena) and have bots spawn at either end and run towards each other, attacking until they die. This isn't at all representative of how players will play the game but it will very definitely catch performance regressions.<p>Replays depend on two factors, deterministic playback and unchanging content. Deterministic playback is possible (though extremely difficult) to achieve, but it really has to be a priority from the beginning, and it has to have its own testing suite and fixing regressions has to be a priority. It's impossible to retro-fit it onto an existing game (sometimes by design, as non-determinism occasionally is mistaken for randomness). Unchanging content is, obviously, unlikely to happen during development and is much more likely to be possible during betas, but during those time periods you have much more time to devote programmer and content developer time and attention to ancillary features like expanding bot programming.",1353673157

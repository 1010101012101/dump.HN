I've worked for him and would actually characterize him as extremely focused.<p>Blogger was close to the brink and only survived because of his dedication. I think Twitter is another example of him getting more focused over time.<p>Maybe he's not overly engaged by mediocre opportunities, but that's a long way from saying he isn't able to focus.<p>I just wanted to point this out in case there were any potential founders who thought their ADD was an asset.",1236499069

507087,comment,506803,506803,0,0,trevelyan,,,"This is quite well-written. I like  his quoted description of the entrepreneur as ""not worrying about the resources they lack, but about the resourcefulness required to get the big idea done."" Seductively complimentary.<p>That said, I'm skeptical the first-order problem is really keeping a sense of the ""big idea"".  Grand ambition is not uncommon - look at the amount of armchair quarterbacking that happens on this site alone. I think most organizations have a definite sense of possibility and fail more from an inability to either manage change, or to connect their ambitions to the more prosaic reality of the paying market.",1236497749

That's why it was so successful. It's the only ""programming for non-programmers"" invention I know of, of the zillions that have been tried, that doesn't suck. Can you name any others?

507075,comment,505255,505280,0,0,RobGR,,,"What you say may well be true.  But Google was not willing to send a representative to say that in court, or have someone type it into an email, or have one of their many automated systems put that into an email.  Google is certainly capable of communicating it's side of things, yet they did not.<p>We should not have to construct Google's side of things for them.  Google is not a retarded person facing the death penalty, unable to defend themselves.  They are a multi-billion dollar company with an army of lawyers and an even bigger army of computers, and if one of those computers had displayed a message to this person explaining their side, it is likely we none of this would have happened.<p>Legally speaking, I think the judge had to rule this way.  He didn't contradict the part of the contract that says Google can terminate any account; he just said that regardless of any account termination, Google still has to pay you money if they owe you money.  Duh.  The account holder presented evidence that Google owed money, and Google presented no evidence that they didn't.  End of story.<p>I remember when Paypal seemed like the most awesome idea since the invention of money, and I remember when they waited until there was a lot of money in my account and then tried to close that account.   Is Google only examining accounts to see if they fit the terms of service once they owe the account a lot of money ?  It would seem uncharacteristic of them, based on what I know of the company, but it is not implausible.  It's the type of shitty thing big corporate bureaucracies do.",1236495960

Even Yahoo, which employs the creator of PHP and several Apache committers, restarts their Apache children every 8 hours. Otherwise you are making yourself vulnerable to memory leaks or bugs that might take weeks to manifest.<p>I would also bump up MaxClients.

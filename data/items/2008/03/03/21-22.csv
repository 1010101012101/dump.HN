And there are many more, including availability of money.<p>My experience is that charismatic entrepreneur can accomplish a lot with very little money (hence empty gas tank) if he/she has the right vision and the ability to organize and motivate (hence fume which by the way is incredibly combustible).",1204579575

128335,comment,128219,128219,0,0,brk,,,"When you're viewing a story from here, how often do you click anything else on the site?  I don't click other links very often, even if I really enjoyed or benefited from the linked article.  So, in the end you'll get different numbers, but they'd be no more complete or accurate than what you already have.<p>This idea would only seem to encourage more sites to spread a simple article across too many pages so that they could better count and track the visitors.  But then as a referrer, you still couldn't do much to get access to those numbers.",1204579451

Absolutely, no f-ing way would I ever let my address get in there, and I would strongly advise against any of the users I support ever volunteering such information either.<p>If you're truly seeking interested parties to email about a topic, a few minutes spent on Google should let you find folks who blog, post to public mailing lists, or otherwise mark themselves online as interetsed in that area.<p>The only value to a fully machine-readable database of the sort you describe would be for lazy cold-calling salespeople and spammers/phishers...though the separation is really only one of degrees.",1204579235
128332,comment,128219,128245,0,0,brk,,,"That seems a little bit illogical.  Why does clicking a link equal up-votes?  If you really want to factor in link clicks, then maybe a counter of the times the link has been clicked displayed alongside the votes would be interesting.<p>But making me come back to down-vote a crappy story/link is really kind of irritating.",1204579234

128327,comment,128054,128054,0,0,wheels,,,"- <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> (MIT Press). This is the only one of my computer science textbooks that I consistently refer back to.  It's elegant and timeless and covers a lot of ground.<p>- <i>Design Patterns</i>.  Dry, boring, useful.  You can skim it and get most of the ideas.  The best part about it is building up a vocabulary for discussing common patterns with other software engineers.<p>- <i>Programming Perl</i>.  Ah, the camel book.  It's possibly the only written-by-the-language-designer reference that's fun to read.  Regardless of what your favorite scripting language is, you have to love Larry Wall.<p>- <i>The Mythical Man Month</i>.  Another classic.  Easy to read.  Stuff people should know, but don't.<p>- <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i>.  Not really a programming book strictly, but a nice introduction to the principles of usability.  If you can get over the slight smugness, it can shake up the way you think a bit.",1204578421

If so, have you tried going to any?<p>Two years ago, I was a guy with a business degree and some open source web apps, but no official programming experience. I started going to meetups, and ended up meeting the CTO of a really interesting company at one of them. We had a good chat, I showed my open source apps, and I've now been working there as a developer for a year now.<p>So, I think the takeaway is...you might have more luck with a bit of social engineering than by just applying for job openings. It's easy for companies to dismiss someone when they've only seen a resume.

He didn't throw up a landing page with a coming soon graphic. He didn't validate the concept with Google Ads. He didn't impress investors, or even customers. In fact it's likely that no one would have ever invested in the concept.<p>He created something that, based on his experience and judgment, that he thought users needed. Turns out he was right.<p>Maybe this kind of inspiration isn't productizable, which is why SV shies away from it. But is there no room for this sort of thinking? Even Google began in an academic environment, not in the business world. It seems to me that entrepreneur-thinking can get you only so far. Every really successful entrepreneur I know -- and I know a fairly high number -- has been a little bit crazy, and had ambitions far beyond monetization. Some of them ended up making a lot of money almost by accident.<p>In our time, the hackers rebelled against the suits and are now running their own companies. A magnificent achievement.

I had to work around a lot of things with model binding and routing to come up with my solution, and even after that, I still find it kind of hacky. In addition to that,  IIS fights you at several points along the way, for example by adding spurious HTTP headers or doing things like automatically redirecting certain status codes.<p>With a framework likes rails, this is baked right in. With the PHP framework I used to use, the framework was so transparent and lightweight that it was trivial to bend it to my whim.<p>A lot of this was exacerbated by the fact that it was much harder than it should be to set up my project to use the source code for the framework that it should be. In thoery, you just grab the project from MS, add it to your solution and change some references, but in practice, if you're using any other libraries that were built against the DLL from Microsoft, you run into issues, because the MS DLL is signed, and the DLL you build from source is not.",1310611363

There's the go-big-go-home crowd, the facebooks and groupons and squares and so forth.  There's the ramen profitable crowd that operate like typical small businesses: the fog creeks and the like.  Then there's the flippers.<p>We all know the story of the Go Big or Go Home guys; they've been a part of the SV psyche for decades.  Similarly, the ramen profitables/small businesses are pretty standard.  My uncle started a small game development house about a decade ago that makes FPS training programs for service rigs in the oil industry.[1]  It's a new take on a very old business model, and while they make a very comfortable living they're under no illusions of a $40MM buyout.  They expect to be doing roughly the same thing ten years from now that they were ten years ago.<p>Compare the above with flippers.  We have founders who come up with an idea for a cool, if maybe gimmicky app.  They build it; it's flashy and does something interesting.  They iterate, pivot, and find a userbase.  Then they sell to Google/Apple/Microsoft/whoever.  Now, there's nothing wrong with this <i>per se</i>.  The issue that the author and I both have is that this appears to have been the plan all along. There appears to be no <i>desire</i> on the part of the founders to build a business, rather they're spending a couple years on a fancy tech demo in the hopes of landing a sweet job with a fat signing bonus.  It's almost like a practicum as opposed to a business, something that you do for a few years after college so you can get a better job.  The defining question for me is this: how many of the founders would be happy if in 10 years their company had experienced healthy growth and they had 15-30 employees, taking home $300k/year?  Alternatively, how many are shooting for an IPO and a company that will still be around in 50 years?<p>I'm not saying flipping a small startup is a bad idea, just that it feels a bit disingenuous to call these ventures businesses.  They feel more like a graduate degree combined with an innovative investment engine.  And, while I understand why you took umbrage at the author singling out YC, these ventures are exactly the kinds of startups that YC churns out.<p>[1]Shout out: <a href=""http://cooleimmersive.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cooleimmersive.com/</a>",1310609276

If you want me my desired salary is firm at 70k. No is a powerful word so use it if you are ok with the possibility of not getting the job.<p>The reality is you should have asked for at least 80 so you had room to negotiate.",1310608904

So when you hit the main page (results 1-30), HN has to remember what 31-60 is at that particular point in time, so when you later hit the More link, it can give you 31-60 for a time in the past.<p>Obviously it can't remember an infinite number of these, there's a limit, and how quickly you hit that limit probably depends on a combination of how many people are hitting the home page, and how often the order of items in the list is changing.<p>When HN was younger, you wouldn't see the expired link message that often, as fewer people were hitting the site, and the item order changed less frequently.<p>At least that's my theory.",1310608903

How many times did you pivot? How much did you raise? From who? How many users have you got now? Whats your growth rate? Whos going to acquire you? Its never about the technology or impact its having, its about the game of entrepreneurship; getting users, funding and exiting as quickly as you can.""<p>right on!",1310608884

But I'm already EXTREMELY limited by the current visa.\nNo green card. Cant change company for 3 years. Can get visa - maybe - after 6 month wait.\nEnormeous amount of info to give to get it delivered. Costs a lot.<p>So if a company lays off someone for a H1B I guess the previous employee was just bad. Cause the earning doesn't sound right, its possible to fire people quickly in the US and replace them. I know for sure that many americans would take the jobs at the salary foreigners would take it.",1310608808

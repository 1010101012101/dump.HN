On the other, I remember similar sentiments being expressed in 2001 and 2002.<p>Besides, you don't always have to be working on the ""next big thing"" in order to be successful. I know lots of successful, and wealthy, people who innovate in fields that are hundreds of years old.",1223211224

He and I agree and our position is to find out what's in the stock agreement without signing <i>anything</i> first.  I just keep getting the runaround which is ""oh you have to sign this nda / contract <i>first</i> and then you get your stock agreement"".

I believe mostly they are just trying to intimidate me.  It's now come to a point where I absolutely can't trust them and I'm going to stop providing code until I get what I want.  I believe you're right, when I threaten to stop things will happen rather quickly in my favor.",1223210454

They are offering their company as a test bed plus some money ""up front"" in exchange for 50% of the business.<p>From their viewpoint this could be a great deal They get a bespoke application (for be sure they will insist that your software meets their needs in particular) at a good discount. Plus if you manage to sell another copy or three they get their money back.<p>Beware the idea that a company is ""well connected"" when it comes to their trade rivals - they might be industry fashion setters but this may not translate into software choice - plus a package that is seen as being owned by a business rival has to be pretty good (or cheap) to overcome that stigma.<p>I have run into a great number of businesses over the years. Almost all of them think that their business processes are typical and a good model for the rest of their industry - in my experience they are all wrong when they think this. Each business has a whole lot of similar processes but they all emphasise different aspects, measures and controls. Writing packaged software based upon the model of a single customer is likely to produce software that will be difficult to sell to others in the same line of trade. A good package is based upon as wide a set of industry experiences as possible.<p>OK - I have raised a while bunch of issues but have no specific advice other than ""Beware - proceed with extreme caution"".",1223208681

As part of this work, I spent a few weeks just watching lasik operations in various locations around the US. I saw several events that made me very wary of the procedure-- specifically, a technician accidentally setting a microkeratome to the wrong size and thereby detaching the corneal flap. I also talked with several patients who were back for 3rd and 4th sessions to fix problems that had occurred previously. It appeared to me that while generally the machines work well, there were occasionally drastically bad outcomes, often due to human error.<p>Overall, my impression was that the surgery is more risky than one is led to believe. I can't give you any good statistics on how risky it is, but I would not consider doing it myself until I saw credible statistics that suggested that the error rate was very low. From what I've read, approximately 1 in 20 lasik patients are not satisfied with the outcome of their surgeries, and this is from one of the big lasik doctors[1], who I presume would have a strong interest in describing the risks as minimal. But as far as I know, there haven't been any large-scale studies of lasik outcomes.<p>You might also ask the doctor what machine will be used to do the surgery. When I was watching surgeries, the doctors generally thought that the Visx machines were the best, but they were excited about the arrival of ""wavefront"" machines that can correct for variations in the geometry of your eyes. I bet that's mainstream by now.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/103194.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/103194.php</a>",1291517129

In fact few people even know about those silly stuff anyway…<p>Inputting Chinese on a keyboard is hard because of the sheer amount of characters. There is no feasible way to have enough physical keys mapping to even a very limited subset (think 2+k chars as the bottom line).<p>So the way out is to use Input Method Editor (IME's) to map a sequence of keystrokes on an ordinary US keyboard to a single Chinese character or phrase. Currently in mainland China there are two families of IME's that are in wide use: Pinyin-based and Wubi-based.<p>Pinyin-based IME's converts Pinyin, basically the sound of Chinese characters in Roman alphabet, to the corresponding chars. This family of IME's is the most popular one because almost any kid born after 70's knows Pinyin, and thus the learning curve to use Pinyin-based IME's is just mastering the keyboard itself. The shortcoming of Pinyin-based IME's is that a single sequence of Pinyin can translate into a lot more chars (1:50 ratio is quite common), and the user has to choose which one is intended. This is considered rather slow and error-prone. Most modern Pinyin-based IME's focus on NLP model to predict the correct chars, and I have to say it is now much much better than 10 years ago.<p>Wubi-based IME's rely on a formal and rather complicated method to decompose Chinese chars into sub-components based on shape, then map the 26 alphabet keys on a standard US keyboard to these components. The user chooses the correct components to form the characters. The advantage is that a single char requires less than 4 keystrokes to input, which is considerably faster than Pinyin-based IME's which usually require more keystrokes. There is also much much less “hash collisions” in that a keystroke sequence usually maps to only one or two chars, thus no need to manually choose anymore. The downside though, is that the method to decompose chars into components must be memorized, which is very difficult, and the mapping of components on the keyboard must also be familiarized, which is even more confusion. Some keyboards come with extra labeling to help this, much like a typical Japanese keyboard. In addition, I have the feeling that this method is designed for professional typists instead of ordinary users because it is quite counter-intuitive to think how chars are written and then decompose them when you are just chatting with someone. Professional typists, on the other hand, are looking at existing documents and try to input them into a computer, which is quite different from the mental model of chatting.<p>There are other less used IME's too. For example bank representatives used to use a method that map a 4~5 digit number into a char purely on the numpad because it is considerably faster once you master it. I don't think anyone is using this method anymore though. The learning curve is just insane. Other IME's try to combine both Pinyin and Wubi together with different tradeoffs, but few gain real traction.<p>In Taiwan and Hongkong there exist different IME's because they use Traditional Chinese which have much more complex strokes than Simplified Chinese used in mainland. Also in Hongkong they speak Cantonese whose pronunciation is different than Mandarin, so normal Pinyin is not used there.",1291516875

A great post was written by Paul Buchheit that called things like fear of public speaking, which may be an inflamed variation of fear of conversation, 'ego-fear'.  While this may not be technically correct, it could be a useful psychological framework.  See post here: <a href=""http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2010/10/serendipity-finds-you.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2010/10/serendipity-finds-y...</a>.<p>2. When I was young I was very nervous around girls, and hated public speaking.  Along the way I became pretty good with girls and captain on my debate team.  The key ingredients were a willingness to keep trying to improve and being willing to shrug off failure.  The first times I approached women I was an absolute fool but I eventually improved by gaining a sense of what's socially viable.  With regards to public speaking, I was <i>very</i> nervous when I started out.  But, once I had looked like a quite a few times, I got pretty good and ended up being the leader of several organizations in high school and college.<p>3. A friend of mine who is quite brilliant but very introverted suggested the book ""The Game,"" which  basically describes how to hack romance.  I wouldn't suggest applying this book to your love life, but some of its insights might be worth checking out.  When you understand that your interactions with other people of the same sex are often as complex as those of the opposite, it becomes a fundamentally different (and often more tractable) problem.  My friend read this book, saw some therapists, and was willing to look like a fool the first couple times as he talked to girls and publicly spoke.  He's now dating a beautiful girl and gave something like 300 public speeches our senior year while the president of one of my college's biggest organizations.<p>So, my experience has been that repetitive practice and willingness to learn are key ingredients to improving and conquering what may be related fears.  Funny how this seems to be the formula for success with almost anything.",1291516267

In retrospect, I think all that stuff is just people making stuff up about what is going to happen in an imaginary future where ideas are worth millions and lawyers are free. All the same, I still refuse to sign agreements like that-- I think it distorts the way innovation actually works. As it's said, we're all standing on the shoulders of giants; I don't want to be under the control of someone who doesn't understand that.",1291514903

But more than that, I think you're wrong, or disagree, with how idea of what a college ought to be. It's worth a conversation.<p>I'm not strictly a liberal arts student, but my curriculum involves a series of liberal arts courses, required. I'm also in Communications, meaning that among the arts I study (art school) I'm getting a fairly diverse set of courses, ranging from film to screenwriting to poetry to interface design to a few other things that aren't strictly involved in my major. So even that study is more ""liberal arts"" than the average technical degree concentration.<p>> I for one am extremely sceptical that a large set of deeply understood diverse experiences can be obtained in 4 or 5, actually anything less then 10 years, at college.<p>I think you're assuming that everybody who's attending college is going there to learn a specific skillset that'll help them in their career, and work hard at developing those skills. I view college rather as a place for people to learn more about themselves, and to have the freedoms to discover things they would <i>never</i> discover on their own.<p>I didn't enter college for Communications. It took me a little while to figure out what I wanted. And in the process of searching I took a variety of classes — programming classes, religious studies, Japanese, an industrial design class — and each one helped me understand a little bit more about what I liked and what I didn't.<p>What's more, I find that the classes I take that offer me <i>nothing</i> that I'll apply to my eventual business future tend to offer me unexpected flashes of insight. That religion course, for instance, taught me more about social experiences that human beings seek out than any social design course I've sat through; it helped me understand and come to terms with a phenomenon I at once point actively hated as a child. Similarly, a flamenco class I'm taking right now is unexpectedly teaching me a lot about my misconceptions of what music is and how it works socially. (If you don't know, the way flamenco musicians approach their work is <i>much</i> different than the way band musicians do, and the resulting society is vastly different and interesting.)<p>For a creative mind, all of these things aid both in specific studies — I could reel out a list of scientific discoveries formulated by scientists who were inspired by an utterly different line of thought — and in the more important study, which is: realizing that the world is interconnected in a lot of ways, and that those connections tend to mirror other connections elsewhere, and that studying all these other things will lead to a richer and deeper education/human being.<p>I do agree with you that my major doesn't force hard work out of people like engineering majors do. I'm a mix myself: I work hard on my out-of-school projects but my classwork depends on how interested I am in the course. I breeze through a lot of things and do pretty well. But I think that's an advantage, too. I don't like that some technical colleges sap a student's soul and make it impossible for them to do stupid college things, or to experiment on projects with their friends. I have friends who want to do things which they simply can't because freshmen-level courses are taking hours and hours out of their every week. And I'm really sad about that, because I know that a lot of people who give up creative projects in college never pick them up again.<p>College isn't about me getting a job. It's about me becoming a better person. Liberal arts is geared towards making me more diverse and thoughtful than I would be otherwise. It's working.",1291514659

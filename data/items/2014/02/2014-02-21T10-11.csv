7276348,comment,7274020,7274247,2,0,dspillett,,,"<i>> a lot of us that are just one SSH worm away from having all of our files destroyed.</i><p>This has happened quite a lot in some high profile cases over recent years, where [Company Name Here] was hacked and as well as taking down their live service the attackers got from there to the backups and killed them too.<p><i>> I&#x27;ve been thinking about ways to create an offline-equivalent backup, so that it can be automated.</i><p>The trick I use to improve the safety of my online+offsite backups is to stop any one service being able to connect and authenticate with all the others, disconnecting the online backups from their source as much as possible.<p>My &quot;live&quot; stores connect to an intermediary and push updates, and my online backup stores connect to the intermediary and pull updates (with restores and automated tests being the same thing in reverse). The live stores and the backups can not connect+authenticate to each other directly, and the intermediary can&#x27;t connect+authenticate to either the live store or the backups. This way if a malicious entity (be it a human or an automated exploit) gains access to a privileged account on any of the three locations it does not automatically gain access to all the others, but the process of taking and testing backups can still be automated.<p>Of course this isn&#x27;t perfect: it is a little more hassle to setup, needs an extra resource (the intermediate location) which could potentially be a point of failure (though your automated backup tests will hopefully detect problems there before they become serious) and it depends on good credentials management (<i>I</i> sill need to be able to connect to all three for remote admin and if you use the same credentials for them all, and/or store said credentials in the same insecure place, the extra protection is lost) but I find it works well in practise. Also as I&#x27;m using the same OS+libs+tools in all three places I&#x27;m still susceptable to attacks using &quot;zero day&quot; exploits on some part of that stack, so for that reason (amongst others) this does not remove the need for truly offline backups.",1392980360

I think some things are suited to visual environments - things which need immediate feedback, other things are not.<p>Think about using Unix. For copying one or two files, or renaming the, use the GUI. Need to do the same with 100 files? I think most competent people would naturally go to bash, and write a for loops, or small script. For these things it is easier. (And I am fairly sure that most desktop environments have a had more time spent on them than most visual programming &quot;languages&quot;).

I recommend listening to Dan Carlin&#x27;s Hardcore History series on the Mongols[1] where he talks about how historians often justify unspeakable horrors because in hindsight there are a lot of benefits to modern civilization. He balances it out by saying that the benefits don&#x27;t look so good if you have to ask the people who actually have to pay the bill. Millions of Chinese, Muslims, Russians and Hungarians who actually had to pay for the benefits of Genghis Khans conquest would probably not see it as a good trade off to endure literally the end of the world.<p>He also talks about how sometime in the future, when the pain isn&#x27;t as fresh as it is now, some historian will write a book about all the benefits of Hitlers regime, like they do for Caesar or Alexander(All butchers of similar caliber). But thats pretty much impossible currently because you need the historical distance from such hard topics.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive</a> It&#x27;s caller &quot;Wrath of the Khans&quot; and is essentially an audio book, find a couple of free evenings and listen to it if you can handle hours and hours of horror. There are also a bunch of old episodes(only recent episodes are free) on WW2 that are definitely worth the money. The most recent series is on WW1, it&#x27;s still unfinished, and in fact after many hours it&#x27;s barely one month into the war, you need an entire mini-audio book to set up the context for an audio book on WW1, thats insane.

They don&#x27;t need to be fast and they don&#x27;t need to be easy (as much as I would like them to), because they are used by specialists in a lengthy process.<p>But if one deploys code on a system, we know a bit more of the system than &quot;it is a computer&quot;.

My guess is that those who are responding with hackles up and swords raised are misinterpreting the terms &quot;supertaster&quot; and &quot;nontaster&quot; and feeling slighted / offended… which really does nothing but show they&#x27;ve missed the point.<p>This is not some kind of hierarchy. A &quot;supertaster&quot; (25% of the population; NOT a rarity, for people talking about &quot;claims&quot; as if I said I helmed one of the Fortune 50 or could see through walls) is not superior to someone with a normal amount and distribution of tastebuds in his mouth or someone with a lower than normal amount. He does not have an exquisite palate, and he doesn&#x27;t have naturally better &quot;taste&quot; than others. In fact, it makes your &quot;taste&quot; far worse: coffee, vegetables, fruit, fish, and the majority of fine dining options are all but unpalatable.<p>As for people accusing me of liking Hershey&#x27;s milk chocolate itself - I don&#x27;t like Hershey&#x27;s chocolate bars or kisses. Never did. We&#x27;re talking about the difference between two kinds of Kit Kat bars here, not all of Hershey&#x27;s vs. all of some other chocolate brand.<p>My comment was a counter example to the article. The author made a very subjective post - which is fine - but then went on to argue that Hershey is clearly engaged in some sort of conspiracy to deny people delicious Kit Kats, which is not fine unless everyone shares his opinion that the alternative to the Kit Kat Hershey makes is more delicious… and not everyone does. My response could go one of two ways:<p>1. I could be angry and emotional (as some of my respondents were here), and call the guy a clown and an incompetent, and argue that he&#x27;s all wrong because Hershey&#x27;s Kit Kat is fine just the way it is, or<p>2. I could sit and see if I could come up with a possible reason why two people, one who&#x27;s &quot;accustomed&quot; to Kit Kat in the United States, and the other, who <i>also</i> grew up accustomed to eating Kit Kat in the United States, had such different reactions on consuming Kit Kat <i>outside</i> the United States. Based on the author&#x27;s description of his experience eating Kit Kat, which focused entirely on mouthfeel, he seemed to be judging &quot;taste&quot; by texture, which is what taste <i>is</i> to a nontaster.<p>To those who resorted to insults because their feelings were hurt, next time, before you break out your pitchfork, sit down for a moment and see if you can reason out the (non-emotional) difference between you and an article or comment author, rather than turning to insults, which are entirely unproductive and make <i>you</i> look like someone crying in his milk.",1392978761

7276238,comment,7266546,7274419,3,0,nzp,,,"First, the moral argument against inflicting pain on others doesn&#x27;t depend on existence of pain.  The moral dilemma is: is it acceptable to inflict pain on others or not.  This is different, and to a large extend independent, from the question if pain exists in experience of others.  In other words, if pain exists in others, it doesn&#x27;t follow that you <i>have to</i>, by mere logical reasoning, make a moral conclusion that inflicting pain is wrong.  There is an uncrossable ontological abyss between the empirical what <i>is</i> and the moral what <i>should be</i>.<p>Second, the case of pain from an empirical side is not at all like what we have in the philosophical zombie &quot;problem&quot;.  We <i>can</i> empirically observe pain.  There are all sorts of physiological and neural manifestations of pain.  Of course, now you may say &quot;ah, but how can we know that these empirical manifestations mean the person is experiencing the sensation of pain&quot;.  Scientifically that dilemma makes little sense, it&#x27;s simply unproductive, it&#x27;s scientifically useless.  If we were to go by that route, we could inject a similar dilemma into every scientific problem, which inevitably would lead to the problem of solipsism.  How can we <i>really, really</i> be certain that anything at all exists?  Well, I suppose we can&#x27;t, but this is a question that science has long ago abandoned because it doesn&#x27;t get you anywhere, it doesn&#x27;t yield any useful results.<p>Do note that unlike the question of pain, the zombie problem is defined so that there is in principle absolutely no way to detect, to measure, if someone is a zombie or not.  On the other hand, we <i>can</i> in principle measure and detect events correlated with introspective reports on sensations.  If we couldn&#x27;t do that for some phenomenon it would be wise to consider that the phenomenon doesn&#x27;t exist for the purpose of empirical scientific examination.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m surprised that my previous post (where I say the zombie problem is nonsense) got downvoted because this is the foundation of scientific methodology.  If you can not, even in principle, measure/detect something then it makes no sense to discuss it.  Of course, you can amuse yourself and speculate on it, but that falls outside of boundaries of scientific inquiry and I hope that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re discussing here.",1392978049

I have no idea what (if anything) this tells us about gender and sexuality in tech...<p>My experience has been the same; I've always found it amusing.<p>> I've also wondered if it's just a coincidence that the US's tech center is also a historically gay-friendly place. I think it probably is just a coincidence.<p>I think it is largely coincidence. The reasons that SV is a tech center are completely independent of the reasons that SF is a gay mecca (and both have pretty traceable causes).<p>Furthermore, I have a lot of gay friends in SF, and I have a lot of tech friends in SF, but the intersection between those two circles is very small - not only do I not have many gay tech friends in SF, but my gay friends in the Bay Area are very disconnected from tech circles (or at least, as much as you can be in the Bay Area).<p>Despite this, I know there are a number of gay engineers; in an attempt to connect this community, a friend and I started an NYC meetup for LGBT engineers: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Identity-Hackers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/Identity-Hackers/</a>  (yes, shameless plug!)",1365537589

If any of these don't match, is the person a guy or a girl?  Even among these, there is ambiguity.  I have a friend who - no joking -  was born with both a vagina and penis.  According to you, is my friend a guy or a girl?  There were Olympic athletes who had vaginas and no penis but XY chromosomes, are they guys or girls?  There is at least one study that showed transgender women (regardless of transition status) had traditionally female brains, so why should a penis at birth be more important then the person's brain?",1365537578

This is obviously not always true, but it might be in some cases that are misread as being male comments directed toward other men.<p>> Some amount of introspection on how to be welcoming to everyone is good, but the constant drumbeat of articles on the ""woman question"" definitely increases my feelings of ""otherness"".<p>The ""woman question"" wording isn't really the most common phrasing, and it certainly sounds exclusionary.<p>In all such exchanges, there are some encouraging facts:<p>1. Mathematics doesn't care about your gender.<p>2. Code doesn't care about your gender.<p>3. A properly run code project doesn't care about your gender, only whether you can code.<p>Expressed another way, the basics of code development are gender-neutral, and where people are involved, a certain amount of direct experience will persuade most people that your results are worth supporting.<p>As to being excluded in a more social sense, the best way to defeat that is not to care about it. It's basic human psychology that not caring about acceptance will make the other group members wonder why you don't care, which naturally enough and quickly makes you an insider.",1365537496

Unfortunately, sometimes that just doesn't work.<p>Having a per-user or per-machine licence where the licence is not transferrable seems crazy to me, though. We consider such licensing conditions toxic, because all it takes is someone to leave or a hard drive to crash and you've lost your investment, so usually seeing that will end our interest immediately.<p>(For completeness: We will make a <i>grudging</i> exception for software that is essential to our business and can't be had any other legal way or replaced with any better alternative.

It's the kind of thinking that results in gadget sites using side-by-side comparison tables, which helps no one buy their next phone. Buying an Android phone must be hell, since that's how most people have come to explain why one model is preferable to another.<p>Marco's description of the improvements is basically incrementalism: it's ""harder, better, faster, stronger"" - X% more Y.<p>The 4S was a bit of a disappointment, because Cook - and Apple's engineers - did a pretty measly job of touting Siri as something profoundly new. But otherwise incremental changes to hardware are just an opportunity to focus on the software instead in terms of iOS (which won't run on all devices, which directly makes the new phones that more attractive).<p>There's a reason we shouldn't see keynotes talking about how dashboard navigation is now 13% faster, and Spotlight search is 8% better at indexing and uses 7% fewer system resources.<p>In the Android world of PR, Retina was just a DPI number, whereas Steve Jobs sold it as a level of detail that met the limit of visual perception by the user. That made it a genuinely interesting feature instead of just another case of numbers wank.<p>I think in some sense the expectations game has been lowered ever since iPhone 4, and that it's suddenly O.K. to just judge an iPhone by its spec changes - and as a result, Apple apologists like Marco are just moving the goal posts as a subtle concession to the disappointed critics.<p>This also means that people missed how much better the iPhone 5 camera is in low-light environments, for one, which could just as well have been touted as a great feature instead of an incremental increase to the camera, or in whichever vacuous incrementalist ways people like Marco choose to put it these days.",1365535944

Thus, File handling is used to read, write, append or update a file without directly opening it.<p>Types of File:<p>Text File<p>Binary File<p>Text File contains only textual data. Text files may be saved in either a plain text (.TXT) format and rich text (.RTF) format like files in our Notepad while Binary Files contains both textual data and custom binary data like font size, text color and text style etc.<p>-----------------------------------------------<p>This is wrong in so many ways that it takes one's breath away. First, one cannot read or append to a file without implicitly opening it. Second, the distinction between text files and binary files is only an issue on the Windows OS, which treats line endings differently in text files. Everywhere else, the existence of a flag to distinguish a text file from a ""binary"" file serves no purpose and doesn't do anything. Third, the above remarks about binary files are simply wrong.<p>> // true if the file is executable<p>> Boolean bool = f.canExecute();<p>1. Do try to name your variables in meaningful ways. A Boolean named ""bool"" conveys no meaning whatever.<p>2. ""canExecute()"" doesn't really do what you seem to think. It may return true for an non-executable file, or false for an executable one. It only reports what the OS has been told to believe about the file.<p>In your ""Listing 2"" (in fact, in all your listings), you rely on error trapping to control the flow of execution. This is a bad idea -- use explicit code to control program flow, for example, in this case you could have used f.exists() to determine that the file exists before trying to delete it.<p>In summary, before writing tutorials, it's  considered good form to learn the topic first.",1365534495

Getting a 2nd job doing 1st level remote tech support (my first tech job) in addition to a full time job driving a forklift to save money for books/computer equipment while I lived with family/friends and slept on couches.<p>4. Joining open source programming projects and reading tons of other people's code.<p>5. Going to a programming job interview and beating all the other more experienced and formally educated candidates by walking into the interview with a working demo I wrote in the weeks before of what they wanted to hire a programmer to build running on my laptop.<p>6. Realizing a lot of programming was going to be outsourced and teaching myself sysadmin work so I could pivot.<p>7. Working as a sales engineer for an IBM BP to get corporate formal sysadmin ""education"" (certifications).<p>8. Applying for an MIT sysadmin job based on my IBM certifications. And, getting the job because I was better educated than the other applicants.<p>Obviously, a lot of that took years and there were other jobs (construction, concrete, moving furniture, factory work, etc) and stuff in between and countless set backs. That included tons of people that wouldn't even talk to me because I was a drop out. I did eventually get a GED and an AA degree from a community college (night school). But, the points listed really were the important events.<p>You need to treat your career like a start-up or any big goal. Decide what you want your life to be like and think of every possible way to get to that point. Then go. Be aggressive and relentless in getting there. There's going to be tons of failures and setbacks. Don't look at them as something that stops you or traps you. Look at them as pivots, as steps in the iteration that will get you where you want to be.<p>I wanted to be a part of MIT since I was a kid (because that's where the GNU software that gave me a chance came from). Here I am. There are plenty of people here that followed an ideal path to get to their current place in life (best wealthy families, best private schools, scholarships, mentoring programs, best research groups, etc). But, there are also plenty of people like me that can look back on the same kind of crazy path of ""anything and everything necessary"".<p>Like zaphar said, don't give up.

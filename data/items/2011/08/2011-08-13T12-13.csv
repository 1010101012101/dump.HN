2880869,comment,2880744,2880744,5,0,_delirium,,,"A problem with a post-hoc adjustment imo is that it makes the connection between the professor/material and the grade received more confusing. Students typically want to know: what does the professor expect, and what do I have to do to get an A (or a B)? Halfway through the semester, a struggling student might want to know, am I on track to fail (or get a D perhaps), and is it plausible for me to bring it up or should I drop the course? The professor might have specific suggestions for improvement, and give rough feedback on what the student needs to do for the rest of the course to get at least a C (or maybe even a B).<p>But if the answer is that the professor themselves isn't quite sure, because it'll go through some statistical adjustment process after the course ends, that's a bit less helpful.<p>I'm admittedly thinking more about smaller courses and especially project- or seminar-based ones. Large lecture courses with homework+tests that are just numerically graded and averaged could more plausibly be done as he proposes.",1313240099

Shared data and threads is not the only approach to parallelism.<p>And, usually, when you are stuck solving a hard problem, it often pays to take a step back and make sure we are failing to solve a problem you should solve. The problem we want to solve is not how to get rid of the GIL, nor improve Python performance with threads but how to use Python more effectively on multi-core/thread architectures and gain performance from that.<p>This is not a problem only Python has. The machines I work on most of the time (a Core i5 laptop and an Atom netbook) rarely experience loads larger than 2. There are simply not enough threads to keep them busy.<p>That's not to say they never get slow - they do - but I'd like to emphasize that the limiting factor here is that we are not extracting parallelism from the software already written.

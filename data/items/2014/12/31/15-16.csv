In your case you&#x27;d need to install something non-standard connected to high voltage power in the floor of your garage and then have to carefully park your car every time. It&#x27;d be expensive and tricky to install, and impose a mental burden every single time you park your car. Not to mention that it would have moving parts that are often put under strain (particularly in those instances where you don&#x27;t park correctly) and it would be prone to damage and wear.<p>I believe the idea here is that this robotic snake idea should have zero impact on the user, and zero impact on installation, it should be a swap out replacement for the current charger. The only difference being that the user no longer has to plug it in manually. It may be a complex engineering problem but it&#x27;s a simple, elegant design solution.",1420041595

Also, it is dependent on the HRTF of the dummy matching that of the listener.<p>I&#x27;m not sure Ambisonics [1] would work for 5.1 sound. In most cases, 5.1 isn&#x27;t produced by mic&#x27;ing in the directions of the ideal 5.1 speaker placement (at least for movies and music, I don&#x27;t know anything about 5.1 production for video games). Typically, the L and R channels are used for directional sound, the C is used for dialog and other things that might be corrupted by panning, and the surround and bass channels are used for (weakly directional) ambient sound. So trying to 3-D pan the surround channels will probably just muddle the effect.<p>Really, the best thing would be to actually record or synthesize in the Ambisonic format, and resynthesizing based on the playback setup. But a 5.1 recording, even one created with a 5.1 rig, is poorly suited for this.<p>[1] For those who aren&#x27;t aware, Ambisonics is a a format for storage of 3-D recordings, independent of the mic and speaker placements at the time of recording and playback. If the mic positions are known, you can project the raw recorded signals from multiple mics onto a neutral format. Likewise, if the speaker positions are known at playback time, the neutral format can be projected onto the proper signals for the playback setup to best simulate the recorded soundfield. Ideally, the recording and playback setups are optimized to capture the full 3-D soundfield.",1420040805

8819738,comment,8819115,8819115,0,0,lhorie,,,"Disclaimer: I wrote Mithril (one of the vdom frameworks mentioned in the presentation)<p>I like the idea of reactive programming, but it tends to add a lot of indirection. This is theoretically desirable, but not necessarily pragmatic in reality. A lot of frontend code in the wild is of the throw-away-in-a-few-years nature and it&#x27;s hard to get mindshare among developers if they&#x27;re required to learn stuff that feels academic when all they really care about is getting stuff shipped the next day. Being able (forced?) to tightly couple a controller and a view in Angular is one reason a lot of people like it.<p>I was giving a workshop on FP recently, and you&#x27;d be surprised at the number of people who still don&#x27;t grok `filter`. FRP is still way over a lot of people&#x27;s heads. Hopefully the industry will warm up more to the concept as React, Mithril, Meteor, etc get more popular.<p>@staltz WRT Cycle.js itself:<p>I took a look at the TodoMVC example and was surprised to see intents reading data from DOM element data attributes (e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/staltz/todomvc-cycle/blob/master/js/intents/todos.js#L7-21"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/staltz/todomvc-cycle/blob/master/js/inten...</a> ). How does one go about doing non-string parameterized intents? For example, I often need to reference an entity from an event handler and searching for it in a collection by ID seems wasteful. In Mithril, for example, handlers can receive parameters as inputs either via closures from the view or via partial application (i.e. Function::bind). This is especially useful for event handlers that deal with relationships between two or more different entities. Is there a similar mechanism in Cycle.js?",1420040581

Philip Rosedale (yes, the same Philip from Linden Labs/Second Life) has been actively researching and pushing the boundaries of facial expression with his High Fidelity project [1]. Not sure it&#x27;ll ever become a consumer product, but the potential is obvious. I saw him demo&#x27;ing his alpha version earlier this year, and it was amazing. Even though it was an avatar-based chat, the fact you can see the eyes moving and the face conveying emotions, brings the experience to a whole new level, well beyond the uncanny valley.<p>The addition of facial expressions and other forms of body language are obvious extensions for Oculus. Case in point: they just acquired Nimble VR [2], and will likely incorporate their hand tracking technology into a future CV1 or CV2. Facial expression and eye tracking is likely a bit further down the road, but not that far.<p>[1] <a href=""https://highfidelity.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://highfidelity.io/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nimblevr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nimblevr.com/</a>",1420040558

Cut down the speed limit to twelve miles an hour in all built-up areas, and you would cut out the vast majority of accidents. But this, everyone will assure you, is ‘impossible’.

They provide offers that they will reduce consumption by 1 MW between 11:00 and 13:00 at thursday, and when electric network needs rebalancing - distributor buys these offers from them (often at many times the regular electricity price) because it&#x27;s cheaper to slightly reduce consumption here, than to pay someone else to power on a whole new powerplant block elsewhere and send the energy longer way around just because at one point in the network there&#x27;s not enough transfer capacity for a few minutes.<p>There&#x27;s a whole exchange market, allowing to publish these offers on consumers side, and buy these offers on distributor side, and regular traders doing brokering beetween them, even some automated trading systems, you can even buy futures based on that :).

I do have a choice, but no doubt there are many people who connect through a proxy and have no choice in the matter, due to locked down machines, security or caching reasons.<p>In effect, is Paypal blocking use of all proxy servers when using their service?",1420038096

It&#x27;s made more complex by artifacts of state law and home rule for political subdivisions.<p>For example, in New York, state and US highways (ie. State Route 5, US Route 20) are maintained by the State DOT -- unless you&#x27;re in a &quot;city&quot;. Areas that are organized as towns (think Hempstead, NY on Long Island with 300k+ people) get state services, areas organized as cities (Albany, NY with 90k people) typically do a lousy job at it.<p>The Federal government has been able to update things like street signals, etc. But fundamental things like road conceptual design, breaking out bike lanes, etc are going to be very difficult issues to handle without local control.<p>There are more people in NYC than Sweden, so the size and scope of the problem in the US is several orders of magnitude more complex.",1420038069

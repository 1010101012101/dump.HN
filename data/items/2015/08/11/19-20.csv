Likewise for safe spaces, outreach programs, and other such efforts.<p>Perhaps someday, if all these various efforts are successful, it won&#x27;t be necessary to have such things.  But it&#x27;ll be a lot easier to <i>get</i> to that point if every attempt didn&#x27;t have to put up with this kind of &quot;but my free speech!!1!&quot; backlash.<p>I&#x27;m part of just about every privileged group possible.  I don&#x27;t need a safe space; the world is my safe space.  I don&#x27;t need an outreach program; I have many opportunities others do not.  I don&#x27;t need a group dedicated to my concerns about inclusiveness and being welcoming; I&#x27;m already included and welcome by default.  The very <i>least</i> I can do is not complain when others try to deal with that, and to recognize that <i>some of the advantages I have will go away</i> in the process, and that&#x27;s a good thing.  Better yet, I can actually <i>help</i> with that whenever I can.",1439323173

Your mind shouldn&#x27;t have to interpret colors, light sources, shading, depth, etc. just to recognize a brand/app&#x27;s icon. The Twitter and Apple icons are <i>instantly</i> recognizable no matter how small they are or how fast you glance over them. Facebook and Google have their icons as just letters with one specific color and typeface, and when you see that color + typeface together <i>anywhere</i> you instantly recognize what brand it is for.<p>Flat icons may not take as much effort to make (which is debatable... in some cases, they take even <i>more</i> thought to create since you have to think about every little line and curve) but they do get their point across a lot faster and more effective than a fancy, shaded, intricate icon with tiny little details. In my opinion, if you can&#x27;t easily draw an icon on a piece of paper in a few minutes, it&#x27;s not a very good icon- it&#x27;s more of a picture or a drawing.",1439323107

That was a complaint I had read somewhere else, so I&#x27;d take that specific one with a grain of salt. Still, I think it would be silly to ignore the fact that the developers have a monetary incentive to making the project hard to compile and distribute. Maybe I&#x27;m just biased, but their site and github gives me a distinct impression that they would pretty quickly shutdown all open source aspects of the project and completely close the source if they legally could. They are hiring a CTO and another engineer. Why does an open source project with this size of scope need so much money and employees? Its clear their number one goal is to make money now, not create a quality open source project. Combine this feeling I get with how they have treated users and potential contributors in the past, I would dissuade anyone from using them as a model open source project.",1439323045

A lot of people buy into these narratives that make it seem like this is an issue of free speech vs. not being offended. In my own experience, as someone who recently graduated college, this is not what is happening in reality. I have never met someone who actually could be said to be against free speech in any meaningful way. I agree that there are specific cases of people getting way too carried away, but when you take these cases to be at all representative of the reasonable opinions of the other 99.9% of college students, then 99.9% of college students are going to get annoyed with you. I don&#x27;t see any reason to believe that the people who take it too far are really being taken seriously by people (except by people who disagree with them), and so I don&#x27;t really see why we should give them so much attention. The only function it serves is to misrepresent and distract from valid points raised by others. By all means tell me if you think I&#x27;m missing something.",1439323038

Which <i>so</i> increased the supply of oil relative to demand that prices fell to 13 <i>cents</i> per barrel.<p>This created a number of problems, including the prospect of damaging oilfields to the point that future extraction would be compromised. It ended up with the governors of both Texas and Oklahoma calling out the state militia, and, in Texas&#x27;s case, the Texas Rangers, and <i>seizing control of wellheads by force of arms</i> in an effort to constrain extraction and drive oil prices up -- to $1/bbl.<p>This resulted in the Texas Railroad Commission effectively controlling US oil output (with oversight from the US Department of Interior) from 1931 to 1972, at which point, peak US oil meant that there was no longer any surplus extraction capacity to limit. Shortly afterward the Arabs tried another of their periodic embargos against the US and Europe, and, to everyone&#x27;s shock, it actually worked.<p>If you look at the price of oil, from 1931 to 1972 it was <i>remarkably</i> stable.

10043746,comment,10042678,10043451,0,0,timmaxw,,,"tim@rethinkdb here. coffeemug&#x27;s earlier comment is not quite right. There were two reasons why we went for this hybrid approach where Raft handles metadata but not documents: because of how Raft interacts with the storage system, and because of sharding.<p>In the Raft protocol, the leader sends AppendEntries; the follower writes the log entries to persistent storage, but doesn&#x27;t apply them to the state machine yet; the leader sends another AppendEntries with a higher commit index; and then the follower applies the changes to the state machine. In RethinkDB&#x27;s case, the &quot;state machine&quot; is the B-tree we store on disk. One of the guarantees we provide is that if the server acknowledges a write to the client, then all future reads should see that write; and we perform reads by querying the B-tree. So we can&#x27;t acknowledge writes until they&#x27;ve been actually written to the B-tree, and we can&#x27;t start writing to the B-tree until after the write has been committed via Raft. So that&#x27;s where the latency would come from if we were using Raft to manage individual documents. We considered a couple of ways to work around this. One would be to make reads check both the B-tree and the Raft log; but that makes the read logic much more complicated. Another would be to start writing to the B-tree as soon as we put the write in the Raft log. The problem is that Raft expects to be able to roll back parts of its log at any time, and our storage engine&#x27;s MVCC capabilities aren&#x27;t good enough for that. The hybrid approach allows us to have good latency without major rewrites of the existing storage engine.<p>The other reason is that RethinkDB allows tables to be split into shards, and the number of shards can be changed while the databases is running and accepting queries. We considered having one Raft instance per shard, but we would have needed to modify the Raft algorithm to allow splitting and merging Raft instances while they are running and accepting queries. (This is approximately what CockroachDB is doing [1].) But the Raft algorithm is really tricky to get right even when you&#x27;re not trying to modify it, and we wanted to stick as closely as possible to the official algorithm to minimize bugs. The approach we ended up going with allows us to have the performance and convenience of live resharding without having to modify the Raft algorithm.<p>In response to your question about consistency guarantees: RethinkDB gives users several options for trading off consistency and latency. The default is to acknowledge writes only once they&#x27;re safely on disk on a majority of replicas, but to perform reads only on the primary replica (leader). This doesn&#x27;t give perfect consistency; if the leader fails over, reads that hit the database around the time of the failover might see outdated data, or they might read writes that were rolled back as part of the failover. Unfortunately, the only way to get stronger consistency guarantees is to wait for a majority of replicas to acknowledge the read, which makes performance much worse. We offer a safe-but-slow mode for reads, but it&#x27;s not the default because the performance is so bad. We also offer fast-but-unsafe modes for writes, for users that want better latency and are OK with losing the last few writes in the event of a failover. See the documentation [2] for more information.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/scaling-raft/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/scaling-raft/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://rethinkdb.com/docs/consistency/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rethinkdb.com/docs/consistency/</a>",1439321756

(Complaining about reverse engineering is not rational.)<p>Investigating analysis tool reports once and for all is the only way to minimize this cost. You seem to neglect various cost-mitigating factors:<p>- Reports from different tools are going to hit the exact same spots in code, for the same reasons, making the marginal cost of analyzing the report from yet another tool low and decreasing and making the matching between support tickets and known false positive reports very easy. Closing tickets as vague would also be easy.<p>- Reports for version N and version N+1 of the product are going to be very similar. Likewise for version N and N+1 of a static analysis tool.<p>- Only popular (and good) analysis tools deserve up-front usage before releasing products. Others can be run only after someone files reports, and for the most unlikely ones being unprepared is the best choice. There&#x27;s no value in a strawman like complete coverage of all possible tools.<p>- Static analysis tools are useful.

Getting that sequence into the (correct cells in the) patient was the hard part.  This particular protein helps prevent blindness in these patients precisely because their natural version of this protein is an ineffective variant of the canonical RPE65 (the sequence of the RPE65 they have is different or truncated from the sequence in [1]). The delivery via Adeno-associated virus works because the eye is special - immunologically privileged. So gene therapies work well for tissues that are immunologically privileged, or can be extracted from the body, affected, and then re-implanted (the eyes and T-cells respectively). This allows the therapy itself to avoid triggering your immune system and fighting the therapy. This is why most of the first gene therapies you will see here soon are targeted towards these two systems.<p>Different disorders will require addressing the truncations/deviations of different proteins.  But if the delivery mechanism works properly, and the knowledge about which proteins are ineffective for particular diseases, this [gene therapy] is <i>the</i> mechanism for curing a whole host of diseases not caused by a foreign agent. At this point, the delivery is the significant technological hurdle.

IRV eliminates vote splitting, reduces strategic voting, and results in fewer wasted votes. Also, the fact that IRV ignores all rankings except the first until the first is eliminated means that you won&#x27;t hurt your most preferred candidate by changing the order of your other preferences. If you&#x27;re voting A>B>C, then if A wins, then you wouldn&#x27;t really care whether you helped B win or not.<p>IRV doesn&#x27;t eliminate strategic voting.  Yes, if A is going to win, then A>B>C is great.  However, voting A>B>C rather than B>A>C can cause C to win instead of B.  It doesn&#x27;t &quot;eliminate vote splitting&quot; except in the case where a third-party candidate has no chance; in the case where the third-party candidate actually <i>has</i> a chance, IRV can break horribly.<p>See <a href=""http://minguo.info/election_methods/irv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minguo.info/election_methods/irv</a> and <a href=""http://minguo.info/election_methods/evaluation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minguo.info/election_methods/evaluation</a> .<p>> Approval voting has the problem of electing a candidate that&#x27;s acceptable instead of one who the majority actually likes.<p>And that&#x27;s a bug?

The problem, of course, is that in practice the transmission channel is <i>never</i> neutral: for example, HTTP and RMI are very different beasts, and in practice applications built on top of either one will end up relying on this or that assumption about the protocol, no matter how hard you try to standardize them. Same for any transmission protocol out there, really. You just have to decide when to stop trying to abstract everything away and do your work, because each additional abstraction is inevitably leaky. In this sense, REST basically tells you to stop right there and get to work. REST is not a &quot;transmission channel&quot;, it&#x27;s an application design philosophy for applications built on HTTP.

The minute you start putting verbs in payloads, you&#x27;re doing RPC and you might as well use CORBA.

Many of the people asking the questions weren&#x27;t intending to be rude, but our society has deemed one&#x27;s gender identity as an immutable fact of nature (which doesn&#x27;t really fit the facts neither of biology nor psychology). So, people have some default assumptions about the condition of gender which puts them in an awkward position when asking those questions which can be offensive (I&#x27;ve learned to deal with the situation by asking questions back to them in a more Socratic/positive manner instead of being offended) for some people.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to effort for schools and organizations to post information on what is and isn&#x27;t a microaggression but I do think people who are the targets of microaggressions ought to consider a more proactive approach to correcting such social missteps.",1439320641

Prior to the internet, when all we had was magazines and newspapers, there was actual value in providing what you and the previous poster consider &quot;low quality&quot; journalism. If some of the articles in a tech magazine were little more than slightly reworded press releases, those articles still had value to me because I had no other way (i.e., no <i>medium</i>) to ever see a press release. Similarly, when my local city newspaper published AP articles, that had value because that newspaper was <i>the only place</i> I could read those articles.<p>Now, however, press releases are published verbatim on countless sites, show up in google searches, etc., and AP articles are published on hundreds of sites, plus Google News, and so when any one particular news site publishes any of this stuff they are providing me with essentially zero value. (It makes me laugh when I click on a link at Google News and it takes me to some newspaper&#x27;s web site like the Akron Beacon-Journal and then that newspaper throws up a paywall barrier preventing me from reading the article, yet I can <i>see</i> that the article is from Associated Press -- why would I pay money to access content that has nothing whatsoever to do specifically with Akron, that the Akron paper had no involvement in creating, when that content is freely available on a hundred other sites?)<p>The second way the internet has removed scarcity is the well-recognized fact that there&#x27;s now far, far more <i>high</i>-quality content available than any human being could possibly read, and much of that is free. Which means a publisher better be offering something really spectacularly special and exclusive, because it makes no sense for me to <i>pay money</i> just to increase my list of stuff that I&#x27;ll never have time to read. The New York Times is an example of a site I would pay for, if they charged a reasonable amount, instead of the completely ridiculous amount they&#x27;re actually charging (several hundred dollars per year) -- there&#x27;s so much <i>other</i> good stuff to read that I&#x27;m not going to suffer any pain from not being able to read a few NYT articles a week.<p>Of course, if there was a workable micropayment system in place, I&#x27;d probably pay for even mediocre content, I mean, if it was a penny or something to read an ephemeral opinion column about, say, a sports team I follow, I&#x27;d do that sometimes. I&#x27;d probably pay several dollars a month even for &quot;low-quality&quot; content, if it relieved me of intrusive craptastic ads, but I&#x27;d never pay a whole dollar to a single low-quality publisher, let alone the $5-20 per month that a lot of paywalled sites are trying to get.",1439320269

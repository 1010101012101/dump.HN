We can just forward the incoming emails into the destination by a tiny work. We can choose the backend email server like Gmail or others. In this kind of mode, we minimize the cost of a home-made email server. However, excepted that several over-killed servers, I have not found a simple/concise implementation of my idea.

Since only my family and friends use my real email address, everything else is easier to filter/label, and if some site gives my address out it's easy to track down who it was.<p>To do this without having to manually create each address before I used it, I had to enable a catch-all address for my domain. Originally, I had my hosting provider (who are great) as the MX and they would simply forward it all on to Gmail. Well, sooner or later they determined that the massive amount of was killing their server, and politely asked if I could either disable the catch-all or find another MX (though they weren't firing me as a customer, yet). Even though my host has always been reasonable, $100ish/yr with them wasn't enough for me to use email the way that I intended.<p>This is where Google Apps comes in -- they are now my MX, and so my host is happy and my email arrives faster than it did before.

Why do you pick that instead of the original 14 years + 14 year renewal?<p>I think you've already decided you want copyright more or less the way it is, so you throw copyright doves a bone (breadcrumb?) by offering a single undo, and hope someone bites.<p>If you try to examine copyright law from basic principles, rather than from the perspective of the status quo, it becomes very tough to support even the pre-Bono copyright terms of life+50 years (personal) or 75 years (corporate), automatic, with registration only required to collect punitive damages, but not required to sue (harass) arguably legitimate fair users of content.<p>How does compulsory licensing work without capping license fees?  Content creators have a monopoly.  Forcing them to charge <i>something</i> for licensing does no good; they can set the price arbitrarily high.<p>If you cap the fees, you have to have a very complex formula so that you can arrive at a maximum license fee, given an <i>arbitrary piece of intellectual property</i>, and some <i>arbitrary proposed licensed use of that IP</i>.<p>Complex regulation like that invites abuse by anyone with the resources to lobby, so it becomes a lobbying contest rather than an attempted equitable settlement (how do you judge what's fair pricing for license of IP that's held by a monopoly?).  If that wasn't bad enough, by capping fees you've effectively partially socialized the IP content industry: The free market and private industry would no longer be the primary drivers of the economics of IP.<p>I think everyone, even copyright doves like myself, fantasize about creating some incredibly desirable piece of IP that we can live off of for life.  We just differ in the judgment of effectiveness, actual financial benefit, and collateral damage related to taking legal action against non-for-profit filesharers.<p>I am only addressing the political and legal problems here; not the practical, ethical, and technological enforcement problems, of which I think there are many.",1354854571

It seems like every other day there is an article on HN talking about ""google down. no support!"" and everyone is always saying the problem with Google products is that if something goes wrong you can't get help. I don't know if they offered 24/7 phone support before but to me, it sounded like this was new and they are focusing on offering a service with support and making sure it stays up and reliable for more serious businesses.",1354853265

You can't even navigate to any of your old games without using using a Wiimote. Why they couldn't put those games in along with the Wii U menu is baffling.

Or worse, our ego that stops us from ever putting something out in the wild just because it isn't perfect. I guess it's best just to follow the advice of Reid Hoffman, ""If your not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late."" It certainly worked for him...<p>If it's our ego that stops us, maybe we just need a little assurance that a failure isn't the end of the world. So, has anyone ever been really burned by putting out something that wasn't ready-for primetime?",1354853054

Most of my activity there is reading and occasionally commenting on the posts of people more famous than I.  So I think it's fair to say it hasn't achieved Facebook's level of success.  Nor, perhaps, will it any time soon.<p>But again, I check it every day, which is the same thing I do with Facebook.  If you want my eyeballs for an ad, either  platform provides the same value.  I'm probably not typical, but I'm not completely weird either.<p>I think you can only look at G+ as a success at this point.  Just not a success on the scale of Google Search or Facebook.",1354852923

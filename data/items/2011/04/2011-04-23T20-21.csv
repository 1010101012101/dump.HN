The ease at checking a person's ability prior to the internet and social media was in checking with their alma mater if they had the degree that they had and therefore if they were as capable as they claimed.  Now it's even easier to check if someone has the intellectual capability by looking at their blog/github repo/facebook/twitter.<p>With that in mind, I think its only a matter of time before that starts to translate into educational institutions competing with industry for students.",1303592182

Thanks for the link here to a recent comment by pg on how karma scores are looking on various individual comments.<p>In sizing up what this means, let's all review together the stated reason for the experiment, expressed in a thread-opening post by pg titled ""Ask HN: How to stave off decline of HN?""<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>He wrote, ""The problem has several components: comments that are (a) mean and/or (b) dumb that (c) get massively upvoted.""<p>How do the highest-voted comments visible in the bestcomments list<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a><p>look to all of you recently? Are there fewer mean comments than before? Are there fewer dumb comments than before? Are the comments that are ""massively upvoted"" since the experiment began mostly comments that are reasonably kind and well-informed, helpful comments on the whole? In most of the treads you visit, do helpful, thoughtful comments seem to rise to a position of prominence, while mean or dumb comments gray out?<p>A link and comment in the thread referred to by the edit on this submission largely sums up the back-and-forth about visible comment scores as a signal on comments in active threads:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465357"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465357</a><p>>> Please bring back the comment scores. It helps a lot in parsing the comments and assigning a proportional weight to each when reading them.<p>> I had to think about this a bit, and I disagree so far. I'm finding that I'm not pre-judging comments as much. It's nice to be able to read someone's comment without knowing first that 70 or 80 or 3 other people thought it was worthwhile.<p>My impression too is that even with comment scores not visible, it is still convenient to browse threads to find thoughtful, informative comments, but now there is less anchoring bias<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/a/anchoring.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/a/anchoring.htm</a><p>of most votes on a comment converging to one score level that shows up early in a thread's development, and more engagement by readers of HN in actively reading comments and upvoting (or downvoting) based on each comment's characteristics in light of the context of the thread.<p>But the main criterion of the experiment is to ""stave off decline of HN,"" and that is what will decide if the experiment was successful. For that every reader can help by actively upvoting informative, helpful comments, and also by downvoting comments that are either mean or dumb--and especially comments that are both. As I recall, the experiment has also involved some changes in the effects of flagging, so flagging inappropriate comments is also helpful.",1303591438

It can be done right, as systems such as the Veteran's Administration's VISTA system have demonstrated. However, there is a fine line to walk here. Implementing EHR for the sake of government incentive, or for the convenience of insurance companies, or even the convenience of walking into an exam room carrying a light-weight tablet (which have their own disadvantages for data gathering) rather than a laptop with a hard-drive isn't going to cut it when you put your patients and your practice at risk of harm.",1303589634

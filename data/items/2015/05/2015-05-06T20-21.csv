I know that I spend a lot of time thinking about different software related stuff, I love it, but I would suspect (and i could be wrong) that the cashier working at burger king doesn&#x27;t think about how they can ring things up faster, move between the pickup window and the fries more efficiently while they&#x27;re playing with their kids, <i>I suspect</i> they go home and thing about their family, not their job, and i think it&#x27;s <i>easy</i> to fall into the trap of thinking about work much easier when your job is a &quot;thought&quot; job per se.... again I could be crazy though.... good luck if I am.",1430945994

But this way you can squeeze four in the same space and since the cylinder is 9.9&quot; high if you&#x27;d need you could squeeze in quite a few external hard disks as well although that would require using some fans to help moving air. You perhaps have 6-8 inches free space, one 3.5&quot; HDD is 5.75 inch high so you could stand it on the shorter 4&quot; edge and put in 6 taking 1&quot; from the 19&quot; and probably have two banks of this to arrive to 3 disks per Mac Pro and leave 4-6 inches still for moving air.

It forces apps to conform to a strict platform-defined security model where things are isolated &quot;by default&quot; and from there the user can use friendly UI to grant permissions as necessary. This means that currently there are only some 30 apps available on Sandstorm but they are (or will be, when Sandstorm reaches 1.0) &quot;secure by default&quot;, or at least much more so than other platforms could claim.<p>(Disclosure: I&#x27;m the lead developer of Sandstorm.)",1430945732

I know it&#x27;s not what you meant, but that&#x27;s what reflexively rubbed me the wrong way about this comment because I have seen this attitude multiple times from other people who <i>did</i> mean that.<p>One needs to consider that suicide is not just an affliction of the mind, it&#x27;s also a product of the circumstances a <i>normal</i> person finds him or herself in. It&#x27;s not just the thoughts that need fixing, it&#x27;s the circumstances too. Usually this is a chicken and egg problem: the thoughts prevent the person from fixing the circumstances himself, and the circumstances reinforce negative thoughts. This way somebody can get sucked deeper and deeper into a black hole of increasingly irrational negative thoughts. Even if the thoughts are clearly irrational to an outsider, they are not to the person themselves. Therefore suggesting that they simply fix their mind does not help. In their view their mind is not just what needs to be fixed, it&#x27;s also the circumstances. We all should do our best to not create such circumstances and to fix them when they exist. In the story of the OP for example, it&#x27;s fair to say that the behaviour of the professor played a big role in almost causing his suicide. If suicide is caused by circumstances a normal person finds him or herself in, do we not bear a collective responsibility to prevent it, even if it&#x27;s just a smile?",1430945625

9501585,comment,9499457,9499457,0,0,beloch,,,"For those experiencing everything from mild depression to strong suicidal thoughts, I&#x27;d recommend the combination of cognitive behavioural therapy, if you can afford a therapist, and this book:<p>&quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy&quot; by David Burns.<p>Depression and suicidal thoughts are often rooted in twisted, invalid logic that we don&#x27;t recognize as such.  For example, say that a stranger unexpectedly smiles at you.  It would be logical to smile back, and perhaps even strike up a conversation to ask why they&#x27;re smiling at you.  The reasons are probably good. Maybe they&#x27;re attracted to you.  Maybe they just randomly thought of something funny.  The risks of speaking to that person are minimal.  A twisted, illogical reaction that many of us naturally have is to assume the person is smiling at our expense and that there&#x27;s something we don&#x27;t know. We fear what the person will do or say if we do anything to acknowledge their smile. Instead of smiling back, we retreat inwards, wondering what&#x27;s wrong with us, why we&#x27;re so pathetic, anti-social, etc..  Two people can experience the same event in wildly differing ways because of how they process them. For someone who is depressed, events that should be good can easily add to their problems.<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy focuses on catching those thoughts, identifying them as illogical, and deliberately countering them until the thought pattern in a given circumstance becomes naturally logical. In the situation above, you would need to recognize that you&#x27;re assuming a lot about what the other person is thinking, recognize that the worst that can happen from striking up a conversation or just smiling back is not very bad, and that the potential gains could be very good.  I had a fairly low opinion of most psychology until I came across this.  It&#x27;s actually helpful.",1430944249

After finishing pharmacy school in my home country (Greece - my parents insisted not to study CS) i went to the UK where after one year of formal CS education I landed my dream job as a software engineer in a big, now defunct, telecomms company (Nortel).<p>The highlight of my career? meeting Linus Torvalds in a conference about operating systems in 1997, where I went as a representative for my company, and having beers with him afterwards discussing the Linux threading model. He was not that famous back then. Top guy.<p>Anyway, shortly after that I had to come back to my home country and and although I had good offers from companies in the UK and the US I decided to stop my career abroad and live in greece.<p>The problem was that money as a programmer here was not that good, but mainly that there were basically only windows application programming jobs, VB6, VC++, MSAccess and the like. Boring stuff which I disliked since I was doing unix systems - network programming  up to that point (that was 2001).<p>So i decided to change career, working as an IS - business consultant in multinational companies (AA and Ernst & Young), jobs that had nothing to do with programming. I did that for some years but got bored and pursued a Phd while working part time in my family&#x27;s real-estate development business. However the real estate sector totally collapsed in Greece in 2009 because of the financial crisis and I had to change career path Yet Another Time (yat, similar to yacc in unix terminology :) So now i run my own small-scale pharmacy business (Pharmacy was my first degree).<p>The thing is that I feel somehow unfulfilled. Although I never stoped programming, for the last 15 years this is a hobby for me and not my main occupation. I feel unfulfilled because I now know that programming is my true passion and I should have never deviated from it, professionally-wise. Anyway.<p>Sometimes I envision that, because of necessity (the economic situation in greece is deteriorating fast, to say the least) I will have to abandon my doings here and pursue again a carear as a programmer abroad. But how? not only I am 44, but for the past 14 years I had no formal Software Engineering job.<p>Meanwhile, I am building a webapp using all the latest and gratest sexy toys (javascript, laravel etc) hoping that it won&#x27;t result in a total waste of time.

9501547,comment,9496568,9501092,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"> There is a mapping that assumes $US -> utility. But that&#x27;s not necessarily a valid map.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m saying isn&#x27;t happening. You&#x27;re attacking a straw man.<p>Very few people are stupid enough to believe that any one number is a perfect measure of utility. Certainly not any economist I know of.<p>> Surely economists use a functional form for utility in their models. My objection is that utility (if it exists) has a functional form that is unknowable to us.<p>That&#x27;s true, and also completely irrelevant, because no economist I know of is claiming that they can measure utility perfectly. At the very best, they can <i>estimate</i> an <i>approximation</i> of utility that maps roughly to the things that they or their audience value.<p>Obviously USD isn&#x27;t utility, but if you&#x27;re claiming that therefore economic models which measure things in USD are completely useless, you&#x27;re just wrong. USD are useful for measuring utility in a lot of situations.<p>> Predictive models are all false. But some are more false than other, no?<p>No, things are either true or false, there is no middle ground. What I think you&#x27;re trying to say, though, is what I said earlier:<p>&quot;The question is not whether they&#x27;re false, it&#x27;s what the margin of error is in relation to reality.&quot;<p>> Economics, while I respect the points, seems to have had a bit of a bad predictive streak. It&#x27;s great at predicting what has happened when it&#x27;d fed what happened before. But that&#x27;s modeling after the fact.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that the alternative you&#x27;re proposing is to treat <i>literally everyone&#x27;s</i> opinion on economic issues as valid.<p>Yes, the accuracy bar for what passes as an economic prediction is pretty low. I don&#x27;t see how this is argument that we should set the bar even lower.<p>> But I make no secret at getting annoyed at the suggestion I have to do a Turing test on Tirole&#x27;s life work when the fundamentals of the field are in question.<p>If you&#x27;re going to claim that the fundamentals of a field are in question, you might first want to know what the fundamentals of the field are. Given you think that economics deals in generalized utility, you&#x27;ll excuse me if I don&#x27;t take your questioning of the fundamentals of economics very seriously.<p>Economists are quite aware that dollars and any other single-number measures aren&#x27;t utility. That&#x27;s incredibly obvious. Are you really so arrogant that you think you&#x27;re the first person to notice this despite literally thousands of very smart people devoting their lives to studying this?",1430943802

This basic income is backed by the value that the group creates (whatever it may be).<p>In other words, profits go to paying back members for their existence.

You could start a company and distribute a percentage of future revenue to owners of the currency based on # of tokens (or whatever) and you have something that ties reward to time spent working on project in a direct way. Not sure you need a cyrpto currency for this or things like this, but is a cool idea.",1430942546

Also other info could be present that is not easy to identify as private.  For example, say the cop was caught using extreme racial slurs against a man who was being arrested after giving his child an STD via rape.  It would be extremely difficult to redact enough so that you do not release any info that could identify the victim.  Even as a person who knows a thing or two about looking stuff up on the internet it would be hard to redact just enough to protect the identity of the victim while not redacting too much about the police misconduct.  Doing so automatically would be a strong AI sort of problem.",1430942515

If the act of issuing tokens is directly connected to bringing value (&quot;Bob brought X units of value in, Bob gets X tokens&quot;), then it&#x27;s not really a basic income. You have to be able to <i>remove</i> value from some people and give it to others to create a basic income. In theory if the system were already bootstrapped inflation might be able to do it, but it would be an awfully blunt instrument, and might well still collapse the system in a standard inflationary spiral. Where basic income may be advantageous at a societal level, where the mechanisms of government can be used to force participation, you&#x27;ve got serious incentive problems in a voluntary system. Why wouldn&#x27;t someone generating a lot of value simply opt back out of a system that deflates it away on them, when just by stepping away from it they can avoid the problem? Who&#x27;s going to voluntarily sign up to be the one giving away value to others?<p>The libertarian skeptical about basic income (me) can&#x27;t help but observe you really <i>need</i> government to make basic income work, if it&#x27;s going to work at all. In fact, even with a government we can all observe in the real world that those with a lot of &quot;value&quot; (wealth) are often able to wiggle out from underneath their putative obligations even when it&#x27;s <i>not</i> voluntary.",1430942506

In that state of mind, things like kayaking and hiking were functionally impossible. Music remained, but my brain retreated to the comfort of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Street Spirit&quot; or &quot;Creep&quot; (etc).<p>My point is that it&#x27;s almost like being a different person. Reality is persecution, logic is warped, and intentions from good days do not always carry over.<p>I was fortunate to have understanding and patient friends who helped me work on this during my good days. Kayaking is still unobtainable, but now I am able to turn to, e.g., &quot;Katamari on the Rocks&quot;[0] for music, and Alan Watts as well. The Zen Habits reminder to breathe [1] is a permanently open tab in my &quot;distractions&quot; group.<p>As the quote from Infinite Jest says[2], the flames become terrifying. I can only speak for my own terror, but the help and support I&#x27;ve received have made it easier to face and combat. Long talks with friends, smiles from strangers... it has all been important.

As soon as the runtime decides to head-normalize the &quot;second&quot; element of that list, then there are no more thunks left to evaluate; ones ends up being a circular data structure that you could have written in C. Self-reference is no more meaningless in Haskell than it is in C; that is, it&#x27;s perfectly well-defined, a pointer back onto itself.<p>Cf. Scheme: (define list (cons 1 &#x27;())) (set-cdr! list list)\nThe only difference with the Haskell is that it requires no mutation (and the same difference exists between Haskell and C). Insofar as that is the case, I suppose you&#x27;re right in that self-reference by name requires thunks, which are kind of like functions, but not really...",1412575038

You are right that we currently don&#x27;t know how prevalent these attacks are and if they are employed on big scale. But it is possible to know and would make a good research topic and/or a way for the community to raise the bar and know more about the state of Internet.<p>Yes do MITM on unauth DH is easy. But that does not say anything about the actual application traffic flowing through the connection. A successful, _undetected_ attack must also know and subvert the application traffic to keep the illusion alive.<p>We could do second level authentication, out-of-band authentication etc at application level to make it possible to detect the MITM. If we do this measurement on large scale and continuously we can find out who and where these attacks are in fact occuring.<p>IMHO one of the best network security research projects lately is the Spoiled Onions:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/</a><p>This project aims at monitoring Tor for bad nodes and use out-of-band mechanisms to find things like MITM attacks.

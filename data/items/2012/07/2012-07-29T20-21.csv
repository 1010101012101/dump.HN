You want to support ""a particular developer"", but you expect commitment to ""the project"".<p>So is the donation with regards to the developer or a particular project? The developer doesn't get the donation with any regards to whether it is aimed at them or the project. Is the developer free to work on a different project? Does the person who donates even know? It just seems like it can lead to disappointment and frustration.<p>I believe I've seen some developers outright reject no-strings attached donations for this reason. What is expected of them? Should they feel beholden to those who give, and even if they shouldn't does psychology inevitably lead to that?<p>That's why I feel like it has to be hard goals.

4309708,comment,4309177,4309456,15,0,JackC,,,"Personally, my intuitions change pretty heavily in what I see as a monopoly situation -- especially a natural monopoly based on network effects. So here's why I support Padmapper, in elaborate detail:<p><i>Part 1: Craigslist has a natural monopoly.</i> Let's assume (as I believe) that in my city 90% of by-owner apartment listings happen to be posted only to Craigslist at the moment. Since apartment hunters have limited time, most of them (like me) search only on Craigslist. Since landlords have limited time and most apartment hunters only search on Craigslist, most landlords only consider posting on Craigslist. Which means the cycle continues, and next month 90% of by-owner apartment listings will still be posted only on Craigslist.<p><i>Part 2: the natural monopoly makes Craigslist prohibitively difficult to disrupt.</i> The sole valuable commodity in the marketplace is <i>information about which apartments are available.</i> Craigslist obtains this commodity for free. Craigslist gives away this commodity to consumers for free. Craigslist refuses to share this commodity with anyone else. So disruption is highly unlikely: you would have to generate a commodity (information about apartment listings) at great expense that your competitor gets for free, and then you'd have to make money on it when your competitor gives it away for free.<p><i>Part 3: Craigslist is taking advantage of its protected position by offering an inferior product.</i> It is the <i>only</i> real estate site on the internet that fails to take advantage of a certain infographic tool developed several millennia ago to represent the most important fact about real estate in a way that humans can easily understand. Which is to say, it doesn't have freakin' maps. This has wasted, literally, many hours of my personal time (longer than it took to write this comment, for example), and the time of hundreds of thousands of other people like me, and it is not a choice that a company facing any kind of competitive threat would make.<p><i>Part 4: Craigslist's protected position depends on our recognition of its ownership of public information.</i> Landlords are using Craigslist to announce to the world that a certain property exists at a certain location for a certain price. The basic state of a real estate market is that there are a bunch of people trying to advertise their goods, and they'll use the most efficient way to do it. If we as a society decide that, because Craigslist is the most efficient way, it therefore has exclusive ownership of the information it is broadcasting, then Craigslist can continue to use its protected position to offer an inferior product without competition and waste hours of my time. If we decide that Craigslist does not own the basic facts it is broadcasting, then the information becomes a public resource, and services will have to compete to make it conveniently available, causing the market to work better.<p>Given the above four points, I conclude that the information landlords broadcast through Craigslist should not be Craigslist's property, because propertizing that information causes harm to our society that isn't outweighed by the benefits. So I support Padmapper's choice to test Craigslist's legal right to control that information, and I hope it turns out that Craigslist can't.<p>The world always turns out to be more complicated than I want, of course, and maybe there are terrible things that would happen in other situations or industries -- or even in the online real estate market -- if Craigslist didn't have the legal rights it claims it has. I'm open to hearing that argument. But if you're trying to understand why so many are defending Padmapper, I hope this helps.",1343595433

Some thoughts and questions:<p>- Do people who get these magnetic implants actually develop different ""qualia"" along with their new perceptions, or do they just add different interpretations to existing qualia?<p>- With respect to this specific device, does the buzzing change intensity proportional to the field, or is it an ""on/off"" thing?<p>- My understanding of nerves like touch receptors is that they activate in response to a stimulus, then send an electrical response to the brain.  It sucks that you have to directly implant these little magnets in your fingers to get the actual stimulation.  Is there anyway to wear the magnets on or outside your skin (say, embedded in a glove) and still get the nerve stimulation?

Sure it is different and a little bit odd at first but basically all they have changed is the start menu, something which I hardly ever use these days. The 80% of applications I use are pinned to the taskbar, the other 20% I did have pinned to the start menu but on Windows 8 I just have them ""pinned"" on the start screen. Not hugely different.<p>The whole Metro thing I have kept away from as I have no real need for ""full screen apps"". It is a little annoying that it is pushed into your face now and then but with the RTM it is possible to load to the desktop rather than the start screen which, while only a small change, is very helpful at making the upgrade to Windows 8 less jarring than it was in the previews we had before.",1343595384

They had been working on it for days, copy/pasting record after record from multiple excel sheets into one big master sheet. They asked if I could help.<p>I wrote some algorithms that matched records on several criteria and put them into one big list. It took me a couple hours and I was done.

It's a question of when and why. Perhaps intentional procrastination on some tasks and plans is good, but when you procrastinate on everything, things don't magically become better and you don't get any special insight: you just stop doing what you wanted to do, and over time you end up lagging behind people who don't share your love for procrastination.<p>Not all advice is good for all people. For entrepreneurs, procrastination is a terrible suggestion. In a small business, if you don't go after opportunities, you may forget about them; they won't come for you.

I can't speak for non-traditional schools, but public schools, with their focus on standardized testing, have effectively destroyed the original spirit behind teaching mathematics.<p>Mathematics, much like other academic topics (e.g. literary analysis), was taught not as a practical skill, but as a way to improve your abstract thinking and problem solving skills.  As another commenter stated, Mathematics (along with most later academics) should be a gymnasium for your brain. I like this metaphor, because if you think about solo athletics, all students are not expected to achieve at a pre-defined level.  Rather students are evaluated based on improvement in performance over time.<p>Sadly, mathematics in recent years has become less about abstract thinking and problem solving and more about rote memorization, computation, and application. I taught basic algebra to college students for a semester.  One of my most interesting experiences was with the dreaded story problem. Most of the students were simply unable to apply math to solve a problem.  They were all very good all computation, but when faced with a problem in a form they didn't recognize they instantly began flailing.<p>Standardized testing has turned math into the process of recognizing a form, plugging in the numbers, and computing. We're now starting to see the first generation of math teachers that are a product of standardized testing, and the results are frankly, frightening.  I've spoken with younger math teachers who couldn't explain the practical importance of their subject.  While they loved math, they couldn't tell me why they were teaching it, other than: ""It's on the [standardized] test.""<p>This is the kind of Algebra we don't need.<p>* * *<p>Incidentally, the only way I avoided the shocking deficiencies of standard high school ""math"" was by fighting my way into an advanced program at the local University. It was there I was introduced to Euclidean geometry and really learned what math was all about.  I think everyone should learn Geometry using the Euclidean method.  I learned from a simplified book (Geometry, by Moise/Downs) which starts out with a few more postulates than Euclid did.  I'd go as far to say that geometry (properly taught) will make you a better programmer/problem solver/thinker.",1343593270

I've never articulated this so I'm not sure what to say.<p>Freshman year I came in as Computer Science and took a class called Minds and Machines that was a sort of intro to philosophy and cognitive science (two years later, the school got their Cognitive Science degree approved/accredited and the Minds and Machines program because the Cognitive Science program)<p>I love Computer Science but I really love writing and ethics[1]. I love communication and the art (and science) of effectively conveying ideas. I'd probably love advertising, to be honest.<p>I love all majors and subjects though so maybe that's not accurate enough. Anyway I went into college wanting to do science, and I picked Computer Science because it had the lowest do-your-own-thing cost. If a Biologist or Engineer wants to do his own thing he may need a lab or machining equipment. Prices for that stuff has really come down in the last 50 years but its nowhere near CS. All you need is a computer. I loved the idea that my only restriction to making things was time. It was the people's major! (cue communist imagery)<p>I had no idea about this whole world of humanities until I took that first class. The teacher was also my advisor-to-be if I dual majored and the logic part of the Phil curriculum had its own appeal. So many more opportunities to write papers than my CS classes!<p>If I had to do college all over again I'd probably try to do English/Philosophy/CS, with perhaps CS as the minor. I have enormous respect for liberal arts majors, but more-so than other majors, and I think this is very important, the value of humanities degrees are very much what you put into them. It didn't seem hard in my school at least to get a Phil/Communications/English degree compared to a STEM degree, but that in itself only meant that what you got out of a humanities degree it was what you put in. I definitely found myself finding humanities majors far, far more socially capable than the engineer majors, almost to an embarassing degree.[2]<p>Anyway I do think the two majors compliment each other. It seems only natural, especially with the intersection of Logic. But I also think it compliments CS because I think the largest deficiency in every other CS and engineering grad I've met is that they have a hard time communicating their ideas and debating others effectively. Philosophy helps with that. A lot, in my opinion.<p>[1] in the Aristotelian/Kant/Mill/Humanity's greater good/etc sense of the word, not the vague-ideas-gotten-by-parents-and-peers sense which is usually picked up on (see for instance almost the entire abortion debate)<p>[2] I'm quite the introvert and it took me a long time to overcome the social interaction thing that seemed to plague so many of my peers in college. I was supremely shy as a kid and generally liked to hide behind my mom whenever we went somewhere. My 8th grade class was just 21 people (two groups of 10 and 11), and my high school was just 500-600 people. I was unused to, well, interaction.<p>In my freshman year of college it hit me. My college (RPI) was known for being an introverted place and I met so many great people who almost literally never left their rooms. Great minds and personalities who were self-sequestered from the world.<p>It felt tragic sometimes. I met and found a lot of people wanted to meet people but had a great fear of simply being in public spaces more and exchanging pleasantries. Others still, and this was not an uncommon opinion, would disparage the idea of small talk as useless. It's funny but, of all places, once I came to college and met enough varied and amazing people I became vastly, vastly less shy. It just wasn't worth it to be shy when there were so many great people to meet.",1343592981

Traditional crowdfunding has worked for a few projects because there is an exact ""you are getting this output for this input"". With gittip it is much less obvious. I can donate an amount each week to a person, but there's nothing attached as to how that should be used for either side. The giver might expect a certain result, but the recipient doesn't know what that is or why they are receiving it.<p>Not to mention there is the issue where of what if a receiver wants to take a month off? The people who are giving do so because they expect something in return, and either the receiver is tied to that nebulous expectation of production, or they can take a break and risk losing whatever funding they received before and the resulting need to build that up again.<p>I just don't see how that can scale beyond a small, very interested audience. I feel we need the hard goals which say ""if you give me this, I'll give you this"". These goals give more concrete deadlines and expectations and probably are more likely to drive results.<p>But hey, anything in this area is encouraging and it will be interesting to see where gittip goes.",1343592285

4309529,comment,4309113,4309356,5,0,kafkaesque,,,"<i>Oddly this seems to be a recent phenomenon. Early 20th  century physicists were very well-read in philosophy, and their interpretations are accordingly sophisticated and rarely run into novice problems. Same with mathematicians; it's hard to even separate whether someone like Frege was a mathematician or philosopher.</i><p>Bertrand Russell and Frege are part of philosophy of science, a relatively recent period in philosophy.<p>It is widely accepted that philosophy of science was initiated by Immanuel Kant (late 18th century) in the Western world, and since then, philosophers have been trying to give solutions to some of the problems he first posed.<p>What's more, most of the Western world at the end of the 18th century underwent a  period called Enlightenment. This meant, all of a sudden, there was a huge emphasis on science and empiricism throughout all parts of society (Academia included, of course).<p>Before that, 'philosophy of science' was known as (observations on) natural history, and then the term 'natural philosophy' was created.<p>Thus, since mathematics is the language of science, this is why you can't/couldn't tell whether a philosopher of science was a mathematician or a philosopher.<p>Even nowadays, most programmes (my own research covers Canada and major American universities) only offer philosophy of science courses, but many do not explicitly state 'philosophy of science'. I know this because I almost majored in philosophy, but I specifically wanted to go away from this branch and instead wanted to specialize in pre-Socratic philosophy, but there were no programmes dedicated to this.<p>As for my personal opinion on students/teachers of science vs. arts, I feel many science students lack an appreciation of philosophy and how much it did for the sciences in its early years. Most science majors shove philosophy with the rest of the arts, but, as an arts major, philosophy is the hardest arts subject and can be equally demanding as a physics course, because it is the only subject which requires an extremely rigorous knowledge of science and arts. And there are simply very few people who hold such knowledge. Philosophy is the ultimate interdisciplinary subject where in a given class, you can talk about the laws of speed and light, 18th century subtexts vis--vis slavery, and biology (the growth process of plants and trees).",1343592195

You build a structure out of logic and feel proud of yourself until somebody finds a bug, and then you scramble around trying to reassemble your logic structure so it doesn't have the bug. The main difference is that you can test a program, so the turnaround time is measured in minutes rather than, in some cases, centuries.",1343592195

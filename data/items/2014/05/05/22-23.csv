The author rolled back edits that he/she felt were unfounded (whether or not they are is a topic for another debate). The student then reverted all those rollbacks without any discussion on the Talk page or edifying comments in their changes. The attempted discussion appears to have happened after this. The only difference between good- and bad-faith edits here is that the student does not understand Wikipedia policy.<p>Now, the way the original author responded is completely inappropriate given WP:DNB (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE). A couple people have already tried having that conversation with the author, and he/she still incorrectly feels the onus is on the (naive) editor.",1399330787

These are not necessarily people who are good at communicating their ideas to laypeople, nor even to other interested experts.<p>Wikipedia is not good for the long tails of research and expert knowledge - that&#x27;s (for example) what research journals are for. I don&#x27;t think Wikipedia could comfortably succeed at covering expert content while remaning so strong in its core.<p>Policies which I personally dislike, such as the poor culture amongst editors and pointless deletion policies, surely annoy me.

I&#x27;ve also attended a lot of conferences with beginner tracks which frustrated me as I found they still weren&#x27;t totally beginner friendly.<p>The book process officially started last fall — I made a survey to see whether designers (my original market) were even interested in coding, and started working on the book after I got good results. I shopped the idea to a few publishers, was accepted by one, but decided that I would rather publish it myself and turned the offer down. (Mainly keep control and additional potential revenue were my reasons, not to mention that the process looked fun.)<p>Continued writing until right before PyCon, which I realized that Kickstarter might be a good avenue to get an &quot;advance&quot; as well as being good marketing for the book, so I launched the campaign, and here we are. :)",1399330470

But there was still room on the cart, which the developer had been using to develop his own unique game called &quot;Avalanche&quot;. This is what eventually became ASTROSMASH (my favorite game as an 8 yearold who never got that NES...)<p>The legend was that the code for the original Asteroids clone was still on the cart; people claimed that pressing the reset button on the console rapidly would cause the game to glitch into Meteor instead of Astrosmash, but I could never make it work as a kid.<p>Years later, I got my hands on an intellivision emulator that had really nice disassembler/assembler included (<a href=""http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv/</a>). By then I had also read online that the developer simply put a JMP instruction at the beginning of the cart to skip over the original &quot;Meteor&quot; code.<p>Sure enough, I found a ROM for ASTROSMASH, disassembled it, found the JMP in question and modified the assembly, reassembled, and suddenly I was playing &quot;Meteor!&quot;<p>Either way, it&#x27;s a good thing that Mattel trashed the Asteroids clone; ASTROSMASH turned out to be a much better game!",1399330448

When it accepts one it forks and <i>executes</i> a new sshd to handle it. It executes a new sshd to ensure that each one gets different runtime randomisations (ASLR mappings, PRNG state, etc.)<p>2 - privileged sshd. This is the result of the fork+exec of (1) above. It does absolutely no packet processing and exists only to perform options that require privilege or access to sensitive data (e.g. the host keys). As soon as it starts, it forks an unprivileged process.<p>3 - pre-auth sshd. This is the first unprivileged process forked by #2. It is responsible for packet processing and most crypto (except that which touches sensitive data). This process runs in chroot, In recent OpenSSH versions, this process is sandboxed using systrace, seccomp-bpf, OS X seatbelt or (if none of these are supported) restrictive rlimits. It exits as soon as the user is authenticated.<p>4 - post-auth sshd. This is forked from the #2 process after authentication completes.

TextSecure is not a business, so we don&#x27;t really have a business model in the traditional sense.  Open Whisper Systems is a collective project made up of volunteers and a growing number of contributors, who are sometimes paid by donations (<a href=""https://whispersystems.org/blog/bithub/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/blog/bithub/</a>) and grants.<p>Thus far, we&#x27;ve been able to smoothly fund the server infrastructure through grants and donations as well.  I think we&#x27;ll probably be able to continue that way indefinitely, but if that ever changed for any reason, we would consider charging small amounts for premium or high cost features like extremely large attachments.  But in general, Open Whisper Systems is a project rather than a company, and the project&#x27;s objective is not financial profit.  I know that&#x27;s a difficult thing to explain.<p>> 2. Doesn&#x27;t WhisperSystems belong to Twitter? Twitter is a US-company (and also part of the NSA stuff), so why should I use that kind of software?<p>This is also confusing, but Open Whisper Systems is not Whisper Systems.  Open Whisper Systems has no relationship with Twitter at all, and is a different organization that came together to facilitate development of the Whisper Systems software which was released under GPLv3.  Twitter has never contributed money or resources to Open Whisper Systems, and is not in control of any of the infrastructure.",1399328411

7701570,comment,7696844,7697562,1,0,nostrademons,,,"Compounding is much more effective when you start early.  I recall a personal finance article where someone did the math out and found that a person who contributes $X monthly from the ages of 20-35 and then never contributes a dime to their retirement account will retire with more than someone who contributes nothing from ages 20-35 and then $X monthly for 30 years until they retire at 65.  (I just plugged the numbers into CNN&#x27;s retirement calculator [1] and verified that&#x27;s correct...it&#x27;s actually more like 32 for the cutoff point.)<p>I do agree that upskilling is important, but many jobs that help you gain skills quickly also pay well.  And the most crucial part is to keep your burn rate low in your 20s.  This is the time when all your friends are living like grad students, because many of them are grad students, and it will never again be easier to live cheaply.  Then work at a highly-paid professional job and pocket the difference.  Your bank account will thank you when you retire.<p>[1] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/calculator/retirement/retirement-need/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/calculator/retirement/retirement-need/</a>",1399327339

Granted there weren&#x27;t that many democracies around the world at the time, so we have no point of comparison. The few period where there existed a democracy in the world (ancient Roman, for example), it&#x27;s quite hard to compare the two, and what worked in the past might not work in the present.<p>But my point is that it&#x27;s just not simply a clear cut issue of &quot;democracy&quot;, &quot;democracy&quot; like everyone in the West like to chant whenever they talk about China (and to certain extend, East Asia as a whole). Look at Japan, one party (Liberal Democratic Party) has been in control of the goverment since 1955 - and not because of corrupted election or anything like that. The social and cultural situation in East Asia is much difference than the West.",1399327301

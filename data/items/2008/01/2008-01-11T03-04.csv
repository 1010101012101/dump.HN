Will we all have to buy the same software the hotels and airports use just to avoid liability?<p>For example, what happens if two people connect to your home network both without your knowledge, one does something bad involving your network and the other person's computer? Serial killer bad?<p>Giant liability bills ensue.",1200023062
97034,comment,96836,96836,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I think the bandwidth problem can be addressed by learning about your router and blocking (or go meet and make friends with) the neighbour stealing it. But not blocking out casual users - ubiquitous bandwidth is the goal. I love the sentiment -- both subversive and welcoming -- like the best of the hippies.

97024,comment,96853,96922,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"> but it seems to me that you can use mod_ruby just like mod_php.<p>If two apps are using the same Ruby instance, then they are sharing  String, Array, Integer, etc.  And ObjectSpace.  So one app can alter any class (say, undefine or redefine to_s on something) and the other app will share those changes.<p>mod_ruby runs all apps in the same Ruby process.<p>If the Web sites are pretty basic and not using any metaprogramming magic, then maybe there will be no problem.  If they are creating classes with the same name, but different behavior, then maybe not so good.",1200021352

8059262,comment,8058363,8059055,1,0,x1798DE,,,"><i>What would people recommend these days seeing as TrueCrypt is likely to be compromised and ecryptfs might not be as secure as it could be?</i><p>Just to push back on this a bit, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly likely that TrueCrypt is in any way compromised. It&#x27;s been stable software for quite some time now, it&#x27;s open source, and there have been no identified flaws with it. The main problem with TrueCrypt is that it may be nearing the end of its useful life as filesystem technology changes and TrueCrypt is not updated along with it (this has already happened with GPT/UEFI and TrueCrypt&#x27;s full-disk encryption). If TrueCrypt will work for you, at the moment you don&#x27;t really have to worry that it&#x27;s been compromised or worry about &quot;lack of support&quot; (note it hadn&#x27;t been updated for over <i>two years</i> before the abrupt departure of the anonymous devs).<p>It&#x27;s quite possible that you won&#x27;t even run into any compatibility issues in the future, as future encryption tools will likely offer support for TrueCrypt volumes - once the phase II (crypto) audit is complete, assuming no major flaws are found, it will be a vetted, open technology, so it&#x27;d be a no-brainer to write an implementation based on it.",1405817717

8059251,comment,8042451,8043025,1,0,my_thoughts,,,"To the immediate comment: it&#x27;s the customers fault the writers don&#x27;t get a lot more in royalties. \nI think this rather narrow minded-- to think that as consumers we have control over what business(& believe me, publishers are a business), pay to the writers. That&#x27;s like saying we have control over what a grocery store pays the company that makes Cheerios. The writers have to fight for what they want, just like we have to fight/negotiate with our boss for a raise. We, as consumers and fans of their writing could certainly support them in their endeavors but ultimately...it&#x27;s up to them. :) \nI would like to make a comment about The initial topic in relation to digital books & Amazon Prime. I read a lot! I mean a lot! Perhaps... 1 book every 1-3 days. What I&#x27;ve noticed is that books that would normally be offered as free books or, at the most 99 cents, are now being offered only in the Amazon Prime lending program. So now, what I use to get for free, I now have to pay a monthly fee for access. This upsets me greatly! I write reviews for the books which are published on Amazon, goodreads.com, & the authors blog, as well. This only helps the writer for future readers which in turn means better sales now and in the future. If Amazon left alone: the already free and the books in the future that fit that same category for free, then I think, this Prime lending idea might be a fair idea for consumers but it&#x27;s not if they stick the free books in this Prime selection. \nAs far as the authors go and fairness to them...? Idk. It&#x27;s going to be up to those writers to let us (as their readers) know what they think of the whole thing. If they ask for out support in changing things then I&#x27;m sure we all agree, we&#x27;ll do what we can to help. \nOur library doesn&#x27;t have a lot of digital books but they&#x27;re improving quickly, however the system is a little chaotic, and the wait list is long. I will gladly rent a physical book or digital from the library before paying for it but, quite frankly, it&#x27;s not as easy as a download from Amazon. I personally love to hold a book in my hand. I love the smell of them and the nuance of turning a page. There&#x27;s also the different text types that authors print. It&#x27;s a way to customize their story. However, I also love the convenience of my kindle. If I took 20 books with me on vacation, I&#x27;d have to pay the extra weight fee for luggage :) but with my kindle the books are easily stored and transported. Portable. I have this ongoing fear that in our future an actual printed/paper book will be a huge commodity, children will be intrigued and mistified by this rare find and libraries will be no more. This would be a tragedy beyond my comprehension. I hope, for our children&#x27;s sake, that printed books are very much a part of our future! \U0001F609",1405817415

8059248,comment,8056978,8058456,1,0,EGreg,,,"Hamas was elected in 2006 because they had better social programs than Fatah. This was a more major factor than their position regarding the elimination of a Jewish state.<p>Almost immediately upon coming into power they destroyed the rest of the government, killed people, ran Fatah out of town and proceeded to impose growing Talibanization efforts in Gaza, restricting freedom of women, gays, etc. They also trained kids to become fighters, etc. It is against the Geneva conventions to fire rockets from civilian areas, and against many international laws to use civilians as human shields. So no, Hamas is not a legitimate government, and they commit international war crimes. I am not sure how you support the idea that &quot;Peace can&#x27;t be predicated on their destruction&quot;.<p>That said, if the international community cares as much about Gaza as it now seems from the rhetoric, I say they should form a coalition to go into Gaza and help them build a real, independent sovereign state there. When the UN inspectors can confirm that the smuggling tunnels have been closed and there are no more Qassam rockets, scud missiles, or whatever else they&#x27;ve got lying around, then Israel and Egypt can lift the blockade and Gaza can have freer trade. Note that all this can be done without Israel&#x27;s involvement.<p>But the international community would have to find willing partners in Gaza, and I doubt the semi-theocratic, ideological Hamas regime would make for good partners. But after Israel takes out Hamas, maybe the international community can form a plan to step in there. Here&#x27;s hoping. But then again, let&#x27;s face the sad truth: no states really care enough to help the Gaza people. The Arab League states deny Palestinian refugees citizenship -- even the ones fleeing Syria. And the same NATO countries that went into Iraq to nation-build are not likely to do it in Gaza, even though it&#x27;s much more readily possible to build something there. There&#x27;s no oil or other stuff to support &quot;American interests&quot;.<p>Other people that international coalition didn&#x27;t really try to help get their own state or avoid genocide: Kurds, Tutsis, Black Sudanese in Darfur. So how do we get them to actually stop talking and start helping provide security and nation build?",1405817328

While they are used to being forced to use English passwords, we can&#x27;t expect that speakers of other languages would like English passphrases. It also has heuristics making assumptions of how people choose passwords (e.g. l33tifying) which may be less valid for longer phrases than short passwords. zxcvbn uses all English word lists and keyboard layout and automatically gives you a <i>Unicode bonus</i>[2] if you use unexpected characters. If I write a sentence in Chinese, I have a high entropy.\nHere minilock actually penalises Chinese by adding the key.length > 32 requirement as 32 Chinese characters is equivalent to a much longer English passphrase.

8059218,comment,8058363,8059055,13,0,tptacek,,,"EcryptFS and Truecrypt are very different systems.<p>Truecrypt is simulated hardware encryption. It creates a virtual encrypted hard disk, which your operating system can more or less treat like an ordinary hard disk, but for the kernel hooks Truecrypt adds to lock and unlock the disk.<p>EcryptFS is an encrypted filesystem. Unlike Truecrypt, which encrypts individual disk blocks, systems like EcryptFS encrypt and decrypt whole files.<p>All else being equal, you&#x27;d prefer an encrypted filesystem to a simulated encrypted hard disk. Some of the reasons are technical: the crypto involved in encrypting a block device is crappier than the crypto involved in protecting a file (most notably, block crypto is typically not authenticated). But at a higher level, the reason is that you&#x27;d like your cryptosystem to have as much information to work with as possible, and one nice bit of information for it to have is where files begin and end.<p>All things are not equal though, and to select EcryptFS over Truecrypt, you also have to select EcryptFS&#x27;s design and implementation over Truecrypt&#x27;s. Truecrypt&#x27;s design is simple and has been looked at more carefully than EcryptFS&#x27;s. On the other hand, Truecrypt is an XTS cryptosystem, which isn&#x27;t great. I would have a hard time making a recommendation between the two.<p>It&#x27;s more important that you understand the limitations of transparent disk encryption. Unless you are pretty regularly telling your crypto software that it&#x27;s OK to unlock a given file or disk or whatever, then it&#x27;s probably &quot;always on&quot;, and your keys are always resident in memory, and your files are more or less always exposed to malware. Malware is a much scarier threat (for most people) than police raids.<p>If you&#x27;re interested: we work in a pretty high-risk environment (we handle a lot of hazmat). Our general crypto regime at Matasano is:<p>* Everyone uses Filevault2&#x27;s native XTS disk encryption (along with some fiddly rules for what state your machine needs to be in if it&#x27;s in your bag).<p>* Everyone uses OS X encrypted DMGs (I don&#x27;t remember what the  block crypto design for DMGs is, but you can check out John the Ripper if you&#x27;re curious) to isolate different projects; we audit machines to make sure keys aren&#x27;t in the keyring.<p>* Everyone uses PGP for email and to encrypt specific files.<p>If this sounds like a pain in the ass, be aware that this is pretty close to the minimum viable amount of security you can be providing a mobile device; if you&#x27;re skipping one of these steps, you should know why.",1405816374

Maybe it&#x27;s some combination of when different cultures start counting your age and a lack of good birth records in poorer areas, and they figure people can more or less estimate which 5 year block you&#x27;re in. Another possibility is that the older data sets were collected using some form that had you blocked off in 5 year blocks for whatever reason, and they can&#x27;t change it now without invalidating the comparability of the data sets.<p>EDIT:  If anyone&#x27;s interested, I found this manual [1] on estimating population age and sex where they go into detail about the assumptions in the five-year age group method.

That should more than cover any unpaid bills/damage/rent that you would be out. Not only that, but it filters out all the tenants that are unable to steadily pay for rent.",1405814596

The economic incentives are too strong to pipe water in. 3km up some mountains is nothing. Humanity has built pipelines a thousand of kilometres long and over or through much taller mountains.<p>The city might be corrupt as hell, but when there is truly a water shortage (right now, if they are using it for crops, there isn&#x27;t in the economic sense) some rich guy is just going to bribe everyone in the way and build that pipeline then charge everyone in the city a dollar a cubic meter or something. Certainly cheaper than rebuilding a stone city.",1405814485

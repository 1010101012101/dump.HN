The original Xbox used a custom NVidia chipset for GPU, sound, peripherals, network etc. The only semi off-the-shelf part was the Intel&#x27;s CPU (the exact same CPU was not on the market but it seems like a different packaging of a regular Celeron). The system is very complex and all its documentation is very confidential, it was not given to the third parties and, by this time, I am afraid even NVidia does not have it readily available so you cannot hope somebody will break the NDA and release it. The same is true for the later generations: 360, PS3, PS4, X1 all have custom chipsets and SoC in the current gen. Having a known ISA from the point of view of writing an emulator is similar to having a known encoding when writing a translation program from an unknown language.",1441486154

Some tools are too interactive and have too tight a feedback loop to make any sense without javascript. A spreadsheet is an example where I&#x27;d probably choose to break support for no-javascript, but it&#x27;s less clear-cut than, say, a CAD application.

You have NVIDIA, AMD, Intel and the community at large pulling all in different directions. With GNU/Linux graphics support having marginal effect on the bottom line there&#x27;s little incentive to deal with it. And you&#x27;d still miss a controlling entity that could validate that &quot;works on Linux&quot; means anything but &quot;compiles with some random kernel release&quot;.<p>Everyone who thinks that writing great graphics drivers can be a spare time activity is delusional.  \nThe fact that we have Android with Gralloc (which in comparison to DRM is, well, a joke), Ubuntu with Mir, others trying out Wayland and folks still stuck on X11 makes this all so much more complicated than it needs to be (and SteamOS is rather terrible in this regard too, which is a shame because Valve is trying to do the right thing with Vulkan but SteamOS is just not a well put together distro, at least right now). \nIt&#x27;s just not a driver model problem, it&#x27;s the politics of it all. Outside of Google adopting DRM instead of Gralloc (or Gralloc getting all of the features on DRM and effectively becoming DRM and replacing it on the desktop) there&#x27;s probably little chance of unifying all the drivers under one coherent umbrella.",1441484864

I think the goal is to have the program read more or less like a book, and this...<p>{Print &quot;hello world&quot; 2} â‰¡<p>printf(&quot;Hello world&quot;);\nThis code is used in section 1.<p>...is not exactly it. It feels more like program-in-program Matrixy thing than a document to be read.",1441483378

I just believe the web is about choice, and users shouldn&#x27;t be expected to use the exact setup that the service providers demand. You can avoid a huge class of vulnerabilities by disabling javascript, not to mention all the privacy benefits of doing so. With javascript disabled, all trackers can collect is a timestamped log of when you made what request â€” which is sensitive information, but not as bad as also having your cursor movements and scrolling and everything else logged. Disabling javascript can also massively improve performance.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that websites shouldn&#x27;t use javascript â€” I&#x27;d not want to use a todo list application that forces me to reload the page on every click â€” but it&#x27;s still useful to support that functionality, because some day I might need to access my todos from an environment where I can&#x27;t use javascript for whatever reason.<p>People claim that it&#x27;s too much work to support something so niche, but if you architect your application well, using progressive enhancement, you get support for no-javascript environments, plus a ton of other stuff like server-side prerendering for latency reduction, accessibility, SEO, text-based browser functionality â€” all virtually for free.<p>Not that this should be applied everywhere dogmatically, it&#x27;s not worth supporting no-javascript environments or scrapers in your browser-based photo editor.<p>It would be even better if servers would return raw data in xml format, with a linked xslt transform to convert it to a structured document, and css to manage the presentation with javascript to control the interactivity, but that idea died long ago, but some modern applications are finally replicating most of the good parts of that system.",1441483254

For example, to say that any class implements an interface is now nonsense - as long as nullable values are assignable to that type, there is no guarantee at all.<p>You now have this nice and fancy type system... with this giant gaping hole that lets all hell break lose. And then we wonder why people are skeptical of the claim that statically typed languages help with correctness.",1441483201

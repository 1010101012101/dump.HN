The app servers listened to a message queue which would broadcast changes of configuration values.<p>This one thing alone made a huge difference in our engineering velocity.<p>If you're looking for a pre-built component to do these things for you today, check out Apache Zookeeper: <a href=""http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/</a>",1277571529

</code></pre>
(And for any given operation, there's very possibly a cleaner way to abstract out the inner list comprehension, which would again make it a lot nicer.)<p>In general, I don't see much of a reason to use filter/map/etc in Python: weak lambdas mean they're not terribly powerful. List/sequence comprehensions can do everything they can do with cleaner syntax and/or fewer operations.<p>This, I think, is actually at the core of this whole discussion. The Ruby/bash approach makes sense if you're used to working with sequences like Ruby/bash do. The Python approach is more natural to me though, because I've written a lot of Python. (And having spent the last year writing a lot of Ruby, I still find the Python approach cleaner/easier to understand at a glance.)",1277571142

1463884,comment,1463425,1463510,0,0,duke_sam,,,"You seem to be complaining that when using a language new to you in combination with a large framework written in that language you would have been forced to read the (very good) documentation to figure out what was happening.<p>The inconsistencies you mention are (in a well written code base) very rare. If you call a method get_name() odds are you are going to get back a string. If you seem to randomly get back an int or a dictionary or a datetime object it's a pretty good sign the code is foobar'd. Good Python programmers don't abuse the dynamic nature of the language. Methods should return predictable types (documentation is important), it might return different types depending on the input but this should be documented and obvious (say a parse date method that returns a datatime object if you pass it a string containing a date and time). The values() example you use is very clearly documented as returning a ValuesQuerySet that supplies dictionaries not models (<a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#values-fields"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#v...</a>).<p>In a number of years using python, the standard library and 3rd party libraries I've never been left wondering ""If I pass X to this method what the hell type am I going to get back"". Just like in C/C++ I need to remember it returns a list or a string or a dictionary but that's usually where the mental overhead stops.<p>Python is dynamic which means it's flexible. Flexibility is usually reached by sacrificing simplicity so Python encourages testing and good documentation. I would argue that these are both necessary features of any good code base, Python is just more upfront about this than a number of languages.",1277570193

Perhaps that's only a rhetorical question, but I think he's already touched on a partial answer: it's a configuration management system.  A good configuration management system will help you keep track of what's currently deployed where (although variation per login id is generally out of scope) and help you be sure that the requirements for deployment are met.  The source for the configuration is normally kept under revision control for non-branch elements that revision control does well: <i>why</i> the change went in, <i>who</i> put the change it (in case the ""why"" was incomplete ;-}), <i>what</i> the change was (centralized diff), and <i>when</i> the change went in.  <i>When</i> can be important for those little used but essential features that you find out stopped working some time ago, and you want to find out <i>what</i> made it break.<p>He advises discipline in removing unused configurations.

When HeLa cells were first derived, most of the benefits weren't even on the radar.  I don't think the initial investigators could have imagined what would have happened, let alone the patient.<p>I think this is a case where the system didn't work... but more because the science got ahead of the ethics.  Sure, excellent science has been done with HeLa cells, but it all started with an ethically ambiguous beginning.  For example: why do we know her name?  This alone should never have happened.",1277568828

Often times my idea of the way things should be done is not Guido's idea, and so Python seems a bit lacking.<p>I really enjoy the pretty simply object model, the message passing OO, and blocks.<p>An interesting point that I read somewhere the other day, from someone who codes in a lot of both: Ruby (to him) is kind of ugly, and Python is very pretty. Yet, the exact parts that make Ruby ugly allow it to have _awesome_ libraries. Python, with its rigidity, means that the core language is great, but the libraries end up being worse because of it. He uses RSpec as an example, specifically. So for him, Ruby ends up being better to use, even though he likes the Python language better.",1277568684

The relative value of editorial process is going up, but we haven't noticed yet.<p>Instead we are witnessing the literary equivalent of Gresham's Law. Gresham's Law is the recognition that whenever more than one type of currency is legal tender, (e.g. gold and silver) the more valuable one disappears from circulation.<p>Now a ""book"" is like currency in that it is a token of its valuable contents. Some are better than others, but people buy a book without fully evaluating the quality. Indeed that is the reader's job.<p>""Old publishing"" may be dying but a side effect is that any old manuscript can now be published. The downside is that the ""good"" books will be harder to find in this democratized world. Eventually we will have to re-create the editorial process of old publishing on top of the new distribution channels. Then readers will associate some e-publishing brands with quality--even more so than today. But it hasn't happened yet.",1277568662

I have actually started feeling that prototype-based object orientation is <i>less</i> tacked on than its class-based cousin. The syntactical implementation is a <i>bit</i> strange (the 'function' keyword for objects, putting functions on the prototype object rather than the object itself), but the mechanism itself seems more generic and flexible. The implementation in Io is better I think, you should check that out before discounting prototype-based object systems outright.",1277568632

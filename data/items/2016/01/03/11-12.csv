The article seems to show a deep integration into the pumps to steal not only the magstripe data, but also the PIN. So I guess they already target chip & pin systems?<p>Plus, depending on the architecture of these systems you can &#x27;degrade&#x27; a transaction from &#x27;needs pin&#x27; to &#x27;pin not required&#x27; (we had a couple of related downgrade articles here on HN and the 32C3 had - specific to Germany, but acc. to the authors probably somewhat applicable elsewhere - a talk about direct attacks against payment terminals to do the same thing).",1451822314
10830325,comment,10826838,10826838,0,0,ignasl,,,"I feel that this discussion about income inequality doesn&#x27;t do us any good mostly because both sides are kinda right but they fail to realize that and just try to promote their own agenda. Economy seems simple but in reality there are millions of variables. Is the income inequality a real problem depends on a lot of those variables and possible solution depends on them too. Education of population, infrastructure built, society culture, human nature, society homogeneity, corruption, political system, dominant industries, social mobility, tax rates, efficiency in using tax revenue, various incentives etc. Everything matters and if you want to implement some policy you need to take into account as much as you can before deciding what is the best policy. Like a chess player calculates multiple steps in the future so should economists. \nFor example in some dirt poor country with bad education and huge corruption the higher income inequality will result in even lower total pie while in silicon valley (where Graham comes from) increased income inequality just makes pie bigger to everyone (and that&#x27;s why Graham argument is what it is). The problem is that everyone choose to see what they want to see and then argue about different thing than the other side.\nI understand that some John &quot;The programmer and self labeled savior of the poor&quot; thinks he is very smart economist and argues that if someone has too much and then someone has too little lets just take from rich and give it to the poor. But real world is much more complex. And before we even start discussing what we should do about income inequality we should first agree on what exactly we are arguing about. What is income? What is inequality? What is fair share of taxes? What is wealth? What is capital? Even what is the economy and how it works! How one or another policy will affect various economic activities? Analysis must be much broader than simply stating your opinion that being rich are bad (or good).",1451822275
10830324,comment,10826448,10827204,0,0,antirez,,,"Hello, thanks for the comment.  I hope the following notes may help to make clear what are the ideas behind the design decisions used in Disque:<p>> Acking is a bad idea. It requires the broker to manage a lot of state, including locking and timeouts.<p>I think it’s much better to put the complexity on the broker than putting it on the client. It’s definitely a tradeoff so many other people may not agree. Because of ACKs, a message will be delivered again to some client forever until there is a clear proof that the client processed the message (the ACK). The client has very little room for errors. In the Kafka model, which makes sense when you want to do stream processing, the client has to handle the <i>storage</i> of the offset. When the offset is committed to the broker itself, then the broker becomes a store that must guarantee certain kinds of consistency, which is fairly more complex than taking state in an AP system. Given that Disque targets workloads which are not stream oriented, where the order of messages is not very important, if not for the best-effort of trying to serve first who arrived first on the average case, to put the complexity of handling the state to the client (by managing the offset), or to the broker by solving a storage and consistency problem, seems a bad idea to me.<p>> Re-queuing invalidates total ordering.<p>This is a fundamental assumption of Disque: “causal/total order of messages is overrated”. There are a few use cases where it is a very important feature to have, there are a lot of use cases where it is not. When you don’t have to guarantee order, a lot of scalability and robustness can be added to the system since it can be AP, can handle the re-delivery of messages avoiding to put complexity to the client, can survive larger network issues, does not need any strongly consistent component which can make operations harder, and so forth.<p>> On the performance side, parallel distributed queue consumption (which also breaks total ordering) is directly at odds with this model.<p>I don’t agree with this statement. Because of this data model, different producers and consumers for the same huge queue, can split the load among many nodes in a completely scalable way. But this does not prevent scaling many unrelated queues as well. Different nodes will handle different queues, and Disque has mechanisms in order to improve affinity so that producers and consumers for the same queues will try to stay to the same nodes whenever possible.<p>Similarly not having to solve a storage problem (to commit clients offsets) makes a system easier to scale. To store something consistently is almost always going to cost some performance.<p>> Queues as opaque objects — you can only inspect by popping the top message, and you cannot access older, dequeued messages. Fortunately, Disque allows you to read the entire queue without mutating it, but it doesn&#x27;t look like you can read old messages.<p>Disque has iterators in order to solve this problem. You can iterate, with filters, the whole messages space. However note that in the Kafka model you have the problem that the queue is a linar accessible object but without clues about what was processed and not, since the broker itself (AFAIK) has no clue about what the state of a job is: to be processed, already processed, processed 10 times with errors, and so forth. Again, this is a tradeoff, I’m much more happy with more state on the broker than on the client for the use cases Disque is designed for.<p>* Complicated queue topologies (fanouts, dead letter queues, etc.) become a logical necessity of the strict FIFO structure. (These topologies need to be declared every time the client starts up, and introduces the possibility of schema conflicts.)<p>Not sure about this since as said strict FIFO is not targeted nor possible with Disque.<p>* Logical de-duping is probably not possible.<p>This is true (or not) with all the messaging systems, basically. Storing the offset in the client side (or committing it to the broker) is the same: you need to have a consistent store, somewhere, in order to make sure after crash recovery events or network partitions you are not going to process the same messages again. Actually in order to guarantee single processing you have to store the offset as part of the transaction <i>that produces the effects of processing the message</i>. The same can be achieved with any messaging system that guarantees the delivery of the message, if you have a CP store somewhere. The trivial case is that you use unique IDs in order to make processing idempotent, or you use to store states in the CP store in order to make out of order delivery of messages not an issue since you ignore every message which does not match the current state. This is more the matter of moving things in some place or the other. For all the cases where single processing is desirable but not extremely important, Disque “cheap” best-effort single processing can be enough and is very scalable.<p>> Last point: The fact that Disque calls its messages &quot;jobs&quot; makes me a little disappointed that it is, in fact, not a job management system. I&#x27;d love a solid, distributed job manager.<p>Disque is a general messaging system, but certain design characteristics are biased towards the idea that messages will be jobs. However it is opinionated about what should be and what should not be inside the broker itself. If you want more, it’s up to the client library to implement a more full fledged job processing system on top of what Disque provides.<p>Last note: given that I wrote Disque to provide something to the OSS world, I was not very interested in competing with something in particular: Kafka or RabbitMQ or some other message queue. Actually the less overlap the better, so my attempt was to create something different. There are things at which existing technologies will be better and maybe there will be things at which Disque will be better.",1451822265

10830319,comment,10828450,10830104,0,0,srean,,,"I see your excitement about Numba, I guess you follow it closely, or perhaps have other valid reasons. So all the best. However, the last time I tried to use it, about 4 months ago, installation was a bitch and it would crap out compiling some functions. It holds promise of course, so does alternatives.<p>What I think the current post is about is that similar nice and performant abstractions for D. I love Python a lot but I have to pay extra attention so that it is performant, so that I don&#x27;t make stupid typos. I have to rewrite parts in Cython or Weave (sadly the latter gets no love anymore). Larger the code base becomes I have to spent more time in the tail part of the &#x27;tooth to tail&#x27; ratio. In D many of these are taken care by default, I have to worry a lot less about these things. The other fantastic thing is DMD has super fast compilation times. It used to be faster than Go in compilation time but the latter has caught up in that department (grossly lacking in others). D binaries execute a lot faster (when compiled with LDC or GDC). It may lack some libraries here and there, but that does not worry me as much, everyone has to start somewhere, and to be honest Python is lacking in that respect compared to R. What would be worrisome is the presence of structural aspects that may get in the way of such an eco-system emerging. I don&#x27;t see anything of that kind in D.<p>In anycase I don&#x27;t quite see how Numba obviates the issues I mentioned. It does not change the Ndarray representation, and the extra indirections lay right there. OTOH some copy elision I would grant.<p>I can give concrete examples. The isotonic regression implementation in scikits.learn was absolutely pathetic. It has been rewritten several times and its performance is still severely lacking in spite of being Cythonized. You can take a stab at it with Numba and see what you can do. In C++ (D would have been nicer) the very first idiomatic implementation in STL was faster than any of these rewrites. I wrote it once and moved on. But C++ is a horrifying mess, now if there was a language that gave me C++ performance (not asking for much) but none of the mess and numpy level expressiveness to boot, that would be sweet. Julia, Nim, D, PyPy are some of the contenders trying to reach this holy grail",1451822171

I worked on a project that had some very specific requirements for a high performance simulation (described by a differential equation). I worked on a very specialized piece of code for a long time to optimize this differential equation solver, eventually writing a JIT compiler to generate specialized code for each simulation.<p>I had a D advocate come along and rather vigorously argue that D can solve this problem, without really understanding it, and missing some key requirements.<p>This sort of comes off the same way, &quot;a numpy replacement&quot;. numpy is big and does a lot of stuff. Like Cholesky decomposition, many of these things have trivial implementations, and then they have good implementations. The trivial implementations will take a few hours to write. The good implementations will take a few months, or even longer. Sometimes &quot;not good&quot; means slow, sometimes &quot;not good&quot; means numerical stability issues, etc. If you don&#x27;t have the right background, these things may not even be obvious.<p>This is a bit of a pattern with D folks. Several times (this, my previous experience, and others), I&#x27;ve gotten the impression that a D fan comes along, invests a bit of time (a few weeks, months) in a particular domain, and starts making comparisons with other tools that they only scratch the surface of.  It can rub people the wrong way.<p>edit: The symbolic expression reference in this post is another example. Computer algebra is an <i></i>incredibly<i></i> difficult thing to implement. I don&#x27;t know of anything that is harder to implement well than a computer algebra system. Yet, you link a single file under 1000 lines as partially checking the box in your list for symbolic expression manipulation.

And if there were restrictions on how many hours they could drive, they weren&#x27;t enforced. So, not only were they crazy, they were tired or strung out on pills. And the sides of the highways were littered with the carcasses of retread truck tires that happened to disintegrate with depressing regularity.<p>Trucker behavior really changed a few decades ago when the Federal government got more serious about enforcing various laws. E.g. time limits and not allowing truckers to have multiple licenses.<p>So then the worst drivers were the morons in SUVs, yakking on cell phones, oblivious to the world. Why should they care, they&#x27;re in a giant SUV so they&#x27;re invincible, right? Whenever I spotted a driver drifting around in his lane, or speeding up and slowing down erratically, the odds were at least 80% that a cell phone was involved.<p>It&#x27;s gotten a <i>lot</i> better now, because many states have made it illegal to use a non-hands-free cell phone in a car.",1451818814

A few specific parts caught my attention:<p>&quot;Human beings are good at turning whatever they’re dealing with at the moment into the Most Important Thing of All time. When dealing with a relatively minor client problem, our bodies can experience the same symptoms of stress as, say, a refugee trying to escape from a war-torn country&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;After all, your immediate emotion isn’t always the same as how you’ll feel after you have some time to think about it. However, it certainly has the potential to mess things up before you come around to that longer-term perspective.&quot;<p>I have felt this countless time, both as a client and a designer. As a client, I often didn&#x27;t give enough time for a designer to iterate (which designers naturally do) and complained immediately, thus ruining the guy&#x27;s peace of mind. As a designer, my first impulse is to take criticism personally and to get defensive. After I&#x27;ve let some time pass, I can usually understand where the client is coming from, and then see the shortcomings of the earlier design.<p>The author also made an interesting observation about how venting your frustration might make you more frustrated. This somehow seems related to the finding of psychologists that &quot;you can&#x27;t punch your way out of anger&quot;[1]<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/200909/you-cant-punch-your-way-out-anger"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/200909...</a>",1451818809

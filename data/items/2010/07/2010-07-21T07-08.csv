When I first read it, I was much more technically oriented and have since shifted towards a focus on writing.  This is largely what caused said quandary.<p>When you're working on technical problems, the question of value is relatively straight-forward:  you are attempting to solve a problem by creating tools or applying existing ones.  As a writer, it's a bit more nuanced.  Moreover there's not a quick or easy way to measure that value.<p>If I hack up a script to grep a dataset, when it's done, I can toss the code and nobody has to know how ugly it is - the task is done.  I cut an hour of work down to 30 seconds using 15 minutes of coding: saved time = obvious value.<p>If I rewrite the copy on my landing page, I may see an increase in conversions, but there's a strong chance that I timed that rewrite to coincide with a marketing push.  Did my new landing page with a stronger call to action and a more approachable voice convince people to sign up? Did my popular friend give me some twitter love? Or did I change the copy to fit a new, more attractive design?<p>Basically, 'value' is an extremely elusive concept.  I've asked a lot of people about it and the resulting conversation is pretty formulaic: it starts with a simple, poorly veiled abstraction of what the respondent does and, as I challenge it, it morphs into this maddeningly abstract compromise.<p>This response was inappropriately long, I realize, but it's obviously a topic that's been tugging on my brainstrings.",1279697542

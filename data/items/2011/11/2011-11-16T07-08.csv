Hand-optmization always makes assumptions about specific data structures and details which can be hard to change later.<p>You can get very close with code-generating high-level languages though. See Theano (<a href=""http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/</a>), for example. It uses a functional approach to compose the formulas for (c-)ANNs, and has advanced features such as automatic differentiation. Scalable generated GPU code can beat the pants of even the fastest hand-written C loops. Sure, hand-optimized GPU code can perform even faster but in my experience that is usually not worth the trouble.",1321429969

When you die, you are put in a respawn queue, and you respawn from infantry portals. The more infantry portals your team has built, the faster the queue is drained, but also the more resources you've spent doing so. There's also a rather expensive option the team commander can trigger that will bring all dead players back to life all at once.<p>It's a nice way to get people playing instead of sitting around watching, but at the same time placing a cost on dying that simply doesn't exist in most multiplayer shooters today.",1321429739

It can be extremely frustrating and depressing especially if you have talented colleagues.<p>Here is my example in case you can benefit from it. I was studying EE and I had classmates who were able to skip Calc I, Calc II and one guy even clepped out of Differential Equations! Me? I was failing Pre-calc and I had to drop down to College Algebra. I was even failing that, unfortunately.  I went to talk to the teacher, who unhelpfully stated, ""In my 12 years of teaching I have only had a single student manage to pass considering where you are starting from.""  That seriously pissed me off. Fortunately, the next test was on exponentials and logorithms, which I just ""grok"".  I got a high A on it.  From there I dedicated even more time to the materials and I scoured the library for better math reference books.  I found some books that took a practical approach to problem solving and used them to understand the process correctly.  In the end I ended up with an 89 for the class.  Considering that I had a 60 when I talked with the teacher, I was very proud of it.<p>I ended up having to add a year to my University studies and therefore added an extra major but it worked out well.  I graduated with my EE degree and ironically some of the people that were exempted from the Calc series dropped out since the program was ""too hard"".<p>Change the way you are studying if your struggling.

Some people (and I'm one of them) welcome the clear bright line that explicit opt in would draw between ethical companies (like Google; they're not evil and this wifi data gathering doesn't come close to being evil) and unpleasant seedy dodgy companies, who wouldn't bother obeying EU best practice data laws.",1321427489

It is because of the carriers.<p>Yes, the carriers, like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile.<p>Before I explain why the carriers are the problems, let's step back and talk about how NFC payment works.  On every NFC phone, there is a chip that is called the secure element.  The secure element is the location on your phone that is separate from the operating system that stores highly encrypted data that only trusted programs can access.  This is the only secure location on your phone that one can safely and securely store payment credentials.  Storing payment credential on any other part of the phone exposes it to abuse.<p>On the NFC-enabled phones in your pocket, the carriers have full control of the secure element.  They are actively preventing other companies from using this to store any information and fully utilizing NFC to their potential as a digital wallet.<p>The reason they are doing this is that Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile have a joint venture called Isis [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS_(mobile_payment_system)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS_(mobile_payment_system)</a>].  Through this joint venture, they want to own a piece of the mobile payment market.  Anyone that wants to create a mobile wallet must pay them for the right to do so.  (Notice how the Google Wallet launched on the only carrier that is not part of the joint venture?)<p>[see <a href=""http://www.nfctimes.com/news/isis-plans-launch-three-banks-chase-capone-likely"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nfctimes.com/news/isis-plans-launch-three-banks-c...</a>]

_______________________
""Dickson Chu, Citis head of global enterprise payments for digital networks and mobile, speaking at a conference earlier this month, reportedly complained that Isis was taking the role of a gatekeeper. Isis would charge fees to banks and other service providers to rent space on its SIM cards or other secure elements, as many mobile operators plan to do when they roll out NFC. Thats in addition to charging fees for delivering coupons or offers. Google plans to charge fees from advertisers for delivering coupons and other offers but not from payment service providers.<p>It's unclear what they (Isis telcos) are trying to achieve, other than extract a toll as gatekeepers, Chu reportedly said. There's so much more that they could do...as it is they are just hampering the development of NFC as a mass-market commercial proposition.

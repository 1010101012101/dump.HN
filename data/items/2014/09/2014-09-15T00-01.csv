Sure enough, CIDRAP has its own current write-up on ebola[1] that is a good supplement to the information in the <i>Wired</i> article we are discussing here.<p>&quot;The possibility of an airborne-transmissible Ebola virus is one &#x27;that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private,&#x27; wrote Osterholm. In its current form, the virus spreads only through contact with bodily fluids, he noted, but with more human transmission in the past few months than probably occurred in the past 500 years, the virus is getting plenty of chances to evolve.&quot;<p>The current rather high rate of transmission of the disease from one patient to another is alarming, and is perhaps preventable by better public-health practices aided by significant overseas funding, but if the virus haphazardly mutates into a form that spreads though more modes of transmission while still being as lethal, the world is in for a very severe challenge. As it is, the predicted number of cases by the end of the year will overwhelm several countries in the region where ebola is now spreading.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/experts-raise-specter-more-contagious-ebola-virus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/experts-r...</a>",1410742755

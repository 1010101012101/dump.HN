9068021,comment,9067570,9067570,0,0,throwawaykf05,,,"Sigh, par for the course for any patent-related reporting on Ars.<p>1. The headline is pure clickbait, and is obvious from the article itself. From a quick glance, the patents concern a specific feature of Bluetooth 2.0 that enable selecting different modulation schemes, one with a higher data rate, based on a header. Whether that&#x27;s novel or non-obvious depends on the prior art, which isn&#x27;t discussed in TFA. In any case, it&#x27;s a far cry from a claim on &quot;owning Bluetooth&quot;.<p>2. The article and comments paint the plaintiff as a troll. But nobody asks, let alone bothers to answer, what somebody should do if they devise such type of an improvement to existing systems. &quot;They are trolls because they make no products&quot;, is the argument. Well, what product would you build in this situation? Wireless communications are heavily regulated and standardized. Build an entire new protocol and standard around a single improvement? And then get people to build chips for that? Who&#x27;s going to adopt your standard when there are powerful network (literally) effects in place? And how does that help when this improvement could be applied to any other protocol? Others can simply adopt this improvement in their own products and completely ignore yours.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anybody attempt to answer these questions. It doesn&#x27;t take much thought to call someone a troll, though.<p>3. HNer DannyBee, a patent lawyer, had once (jokingly?) suggested that defendants may start faring well in ED Texas if they, say, built a stadium in Marshall. Looks like somebody at Samsung is thinking along the same lines. Though it didn&#x27;t help in this case, I guess it may help in the longer term, especially given that Samsung is not an American company, something jurors may be consciously or subconsciously biased against.",1424260670

The latter is more like state capitalism, i.e like most &#x27;communist&#x27; countries we have seen. If you actually read what communism, socialism and marxism are about, you&#x27;ll find that they are a far cry from the ideology of the soviet union (as defined by their actions). For one, a dictatorship of the working class, such as direct democracy, is a cornerstone of communism but clearly did not feature in Soviet states. It was a distortion by Stalin, I believe, since it&#x27;s also called Stalinism.<p>It does seem, however, mob mentality (think the effect Hitler&#x27;s speeches had, despite such insane content) combined with a dictatorship of the proletariat creates the perfect open field for totalitarianism to take hold, where even further power is taken from the working class. The fact it also creates a scapegoat in the capitalist, wealthy class is even worse.",1424260464

After all, a merge should only occur to merge a finalized branch in.</i><p>This sounds like a completely arbitrary rule to me. I just don&#x27;t get why people try so hard to avoid merges, and instead go down the rebase route.<p>Rebasing isn&#x27;t just a pain, it&#x27;s rewriting history. It&#x27;s potentially dangerous in a team environment. You can&#x27;t distribute your rebased branch without a force push, and that risks two versions of the branch&#x27;s commits getting into the repository, or losing someone&#x27;s commits altogether. It&#x27;s usually not worth the effort.<p>It also presumes a simplistic development environment. Typically, I see branches that fit into categories; let&#x27;s name them master, develop, small-feature, big-feature, next-gen-architecture.<p>Small-feature branches can be rebased fairly easily. There&#x27;s not many commits, they&#x27;re most likely worked on by a single person so the history isn&#x27;t distributed, and replaying the commits isn&#x27;t too onerous.<p>Big-feature branches are a little more tedious. This is where rebasing starts to become a pain; the big feature may have touched code that has since changed from commits of a few small-feature branches.<p>Next-gen-architecture is where it all falls apart. Trying to do a major refactor while simultaneously keeping customers happy with smaller features is a fact of startup business, if not most businesses. Rebasing becomes a multi-hour exercise because there are hundreds, if not thousands of commits to replay. And everyone on the team has this branch, and there may be sub-branches of it that are destined to be merged into it. All the sub-branches need to be rebased too.",1424258965

I think Germans get satire and humor. I&#x27;d say we are in that respect closer to the British than the American (But I have to admit that  the Brits are light years ahead when it comes to everything entertaining) It&#x27;s just that our media outlets are characterized by another German trait: fear of risk. If a program works well enough than nothing is going to change. Just think about how long &quot;Wetten Dass...?!&quot; was on air.<p>As far as tv programs are concerned I think that &quot;Stromberg&quot; or &quot;Tatortreiniger&quot; aren&#x27;t too bad.",1424257548

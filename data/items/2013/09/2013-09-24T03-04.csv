What you are talking about is not universal healthcare. Debate over, closed; we aren&#x27;t even talking about the same thing. You are in no way, shape or form talking about universal healthcare, don&#x27;t even delude yourself that you are - in trying to define it you are explicitly defining against it.<p><i>> What happens when that medication is fundamentally uncheap, like herceptin, in New Zealand? Sure, herceptin is contrived, because that&#x27;s a patenting issue. what if it&#x27;s discodermolide, which doesn&#x27;t exist in more than ~10 g quantity in the universe and is rediculously expensive to manufacture? Who gets/who doesnt?</i><p>Well, let&#x27;s first look at the other side of the coin.
What happens in the US if you want access to this Drug? What happens in Africa?
These new monoclonal antibodies are presenting big challenges to health economics everywhere. As far as I can ascertain NZ currently will pay for 52 weeks of Herceptin, as best evidence suggests is most effective, in line with most other countries with universal healthcare. 
So in these countries, regardless of who you are, how much money you have, how old you are - if you have a HER2+ breast cancer you will receive a year&#x27;s worth of Herceptin, along with all your other medical treatment.
So that&#x27;s Initial screening mammography , Ultrasound, FNAB, Surgcial resection +- sentinel node biopsy, radiotherapy (if local excision performed) and THEN chemotherapy.<p>Your cost? In australia, that would be 4.20 per filled prescription of you are a health-care card holder (low income) or $23 if you don&#x27;t. All that for around $40,000 worth of surgery/Investigations and another $50,000 of chemotherapy.<p>In the US? I guess it would depend on your insurance but if you don&#x27;t, I guess you go without.<p><i>>>Who gets/who doesnt?</i><p>Whatever way you try to spin this, more people have access in countries with universal healthcare. In the US you can either afford to pay or you can&#x27;t. In other countries with universal healthcare, it is either provided free to all (thereby increasing uptake and availability of care); or, in the case of newer biologic treatments in the tens of thousands of dollars, it may not be approved, and you will then go without or for the top order who can afford to pay for it themselves, get access. So if you want to be really anal you can point and stare at that glaring inequity which occurs <i>in very expensive drugs that have not yet been approved</i>, or you can say that &#x27;the system works! people are getting access to lifesaving medicines!&#x27; - which is what is actually happening<p><i>>>&quot;why is this person&#x27;s life subsidized&quot;, but not mine?</i><p>Again, the scenario you are making doesn&#x27;t happen in the brutalistic &#x27;death panel&#x27; terms you are attempting to cast it in. Yes, some medicines aren&#x27;t available on government subsidy as mentioned before. But a <i>hyperexpensive drug that prolongs the life</i> is an example of Herceptin; it increases the survival of patients with HER2+ cancers, previously a poor prognisticator, to that of the hormone-receptor positive tumours. The actual decrease of recurrance was approx 13% over 5 years. So here we have a perfect example of a hyperexpensive drug, that improves survival, in a small subset of the population, that was relatively rapidly approved by the government for treatment.
<i>&quot;why is this person&#x27;s life subsidized&quot;, but not mine?</i> - This doesn&#x27;t happen. No-one is making those types of decisions. Anywhere. I don&#x27;t know why everyone in the US who wants to argue so strongly against universal healthcare believes this is going to be the case. It simply doesn&#x27;t happen and if your proposed system is looking like these things WILL happen then you should be trying to make your systems more like ours.<p>Bottom line: Universal Healthcare works. It delivers good outcomes to everyone without imposing a financial burden that will cripple for the remainder of life. It does this without &#x27;death panels&#x27; that decide who gets care and who doesn&#x27;t. If you want to argue differently, then you are not understanding how Universal healthcare actually works in the countries that have had it implemented for over 70 years. Is it perfect? No; but it does seem inherently more <i>just</i>.",1379994894

This was further refined by Linnik who showed that large enough integers can always be represented by 7 cubes (more details in the paper, I&#x27;m just summarising).<p>This paper provides support for the conjecture that for sufficiently large integers you only need 4 cubes, and find a possible lower bound on what large enough means - greater than 7373170279850.<p>It&#x27;s relatively easy to show that 7373170279850 cannot be written as the sum of four cubes. The hard aspect is finding such a number in the first place, and then determining if it is the largest such number.<p>Their method was to find a number <i>N_1</i> that is not <i>C_4</i> (where <i>C_s</i> means it can be written as the sum of <i>s</i> cubes), and then check every number between <i>[N_1, 10.N_1]</i>.

6435828,comment,6435529,6435529,33,0,ericabiz,,,"Hello, author. Meet me. I was much like the boy in your article--except in one way.<p>I was thrown into tests at a young age which showed a high IQ. I had difficulty in school with outbursts. I did not easily read social cues from others. I had strange interests, like an obsession with the Civil War or (in sixth grade) a personal God that I carried around with me because I liked the word &quot;polytheism.&quot;<p>I was an obsessive and voracious reader, but always an outcast. I was ridiculously pedantic--in first grade I refused to write &quot;Mr.&quot; with a period at the end of it (I&#x27;m American) because in Roald Dahl books, he didn&#x27;t use the period after &quot;Mr&quot;.<p>I still write my periods outside of quotes, and I argued with a teacher in college regarding two sentences after a period. These and other arguments eventually led me to dropping out of college. Fortunately, I found computers and entrepreneurship--plus a lot of books on how to read body language--and I&#x27;ve done pretty well for myself since.<p>Oh, and did I mention I&#x27;m a woman? Yep, born female, with every issue you describe.<p>FTA: &quot;Jordan secretly confessed to me that his English teacher must be dumb because she referred to certain assignments as homework when she allowed them to be completed in class. She should have renamed them schoolwork, he said, because they were being completed at school. In twenty-five years of therapy practice, Ive never known a girl to make such a comment.&quot;<p>Well, good news for you, then, sir: There&#x27;s an entire subreddit of us. <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/2x_intj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/2x_intj</a> Perhaps you should come visit sometime. Or are you too busy making gendered statements and deciding that it must be &quot;masculinity&quot; that causes these issues, instead of diving deeper into the issue?<p>I certainly could have benefited from a class on how to understand facial cues. I could still benefit from a class on tact. I still make people uncomfortable sometimes when I talk to them.<p>I&#x27;m a female, an introvert, and I have been diagnosed with ADHD. (A diagnosis which unequivocally changed my life for the better.) Making light of issues like this, or narrowing them to &quot;boys will be boys&quot;, is a sad misinterpretation of a real issue. Do I have Asperger&#x27;s? It&#x27;s certainly been suggested to me several times by others, but ADHD more fits who I am.<p>To those of you reading this, I hope you don&#x27;t take it too literally. There are kids out there who need real help. I wish I would have had more of it. Asperger&#x27;s/autism or not, school was pretty much miserable for me, and I would have been grateful for the opportunity to learn how to really connect with others.",1379994236

With Apple the situation is reversed. The lesson is that actual execution is not so important, it is more how you have built your brand over time. It&#x27;s just like at school, the same joke said by a cool kid and greeted with laughter, if tried by an uncool kid will probably fall flat.<p>And it&#x27;s hard for both school kids and companies to escape the trap of uncoolness - it tends to give people a whiny, desperate element - which people hate. Part of the reason people are so harsh on Microsoft and soft on Apple, because the former seems to try so hard to impress while the latter is effortless and self-assured. Humans can be pretty cruel.

They just let in anyone that looked in one type of attire, and had some numbered badge come into one of the reserved conference rooms. IoW, the security person did not ask for ID, or a password to enter. The fault lies on the brothel, not the visitor. For all we know, anyone could have come in looking with that attire, and a matching badge out of coincidence (maybe there was a costume party, who knows, still the brothel did not do a good job of securing the reserved conference rooms).<p>> No password, no HTTPS, no access controls at all. Who is responsible for the security breach? You or the bank?<p>The bank, they are not complying with the legal statues, and more than likely violating their own privacy policy, if any exist.<p>> I would argue that if there are no technological access controls in place, there is no such thing as &quot;unauthorized access&quot; You can&#x27;t be unauthorized if there is no authorization. The default on the internet is &quot;can access&quot;<p>That is correct. In that analogy, it would be an open business, like store or malls.

The worst they can charge him is for impersonation.

But I&#x27;ve done a whole lot of work (> 5 years) with autistic kids and a fair amount of training.<p>Hats off to the airport staff for being so accommodating, definitely. But I wonder about the parents. They&#x27;ve gone to great lengths to ensure their son is able to travel and their heart is in the right place. But what happens when the airport can no longer facilitate these conditions? The shit storm that will be unleashed will be ferocious since his expectations have been set in stone over time.<p>I understand that routine is very important to a number of autistic people. But not everything can be controlled. Staff move on, different passengers travel on different days and the weather changes. There are infinite variables.<p>My particular strategy would be to control the things that can be controlled. Introduce artificial events that you can keep constant. Perhaps a set of clothes designed only for flights. A trip to a fast food outlet on the way to the airport. A particular toy or electronic device (radio?) for the trip. This all sets up an expectation for what is about to happen, hopefully reducing the need for specific events - like the same airport staff being in a particular place, or the same seats on a flight.<p>And maybe the parents have tried all of this before or know it just won&#x27;t work with their son. Everybody is different, and not all strategies work with the same people.

It is a sensitive situation and it involves extended social networks of friends; both sides agree on the amounts, and both sides agree that it should be paid. What are some ways to, er, &quot;incent&quot; the gentleman in question to pay his debt, preferably not involving escalating hostilities or legal threat? Any trusted techniques for raising the temperature in a firm but civilized way? Thanks.",1379992045

6435665,comment,6435529,6435529,26,0,jonnathanson,,,"OP here (FYI - I am not the author).<p>My big concern with misdiagnosing autism in high-IQ children is that it conflates autism with introversion -- a conflation that has been progressing for some time now, and which has been accelerating in recent decades. This is bad for the legitimately autistic, and it&#x27;s bad for introverts.<p>It&#x27;s bad for the autistic because it lumps a fairly heterogeneous set of children into the same spectrum, confounding our best efforts to get to the true roots of autism. If we&#x27;re treating too many nonautistic children as &quot;autistic,&quot; then by nature, we&#x27;re diluting the actual pool of people we should be studying and helping. We&#x27;re throwing too many red herrings and exceptions into the data set.<p>It&#x27;s bad for the introverted and highly intelligent because it further stigmatizes both of those things, especially in combination. By establishing extroversion and median IQ as &quot;ideal,&quot; we&#x27;re insinuating that the introverted and gifted are somehow defective. We&#x27;re behaving as though our gifted children should be bent and twisted into acting more like everyone else, when in fact, we should be nurturing their gifts.<p>While autism-spectrum disorders, introversion, and high IQ can certainly overlap, they are not by nature the same things.",1379991861

139733,comment,139725,139725,0,0,brentr,,,"I would consider myself to be relatively new to coding. I can read code in almost any programming language, however, I have never been involved in a large scale project. I just never could find the time to get involved with something that would take longer than a weekend to work on; that is my own fault. Now that I am unemployed (I resigned to move back to Ohio due to the cost of living in Rhode Island) and have no hope of finding a job in finance anytime soon due to the credit crunch, I have decided to pursue a second undergraduate degree. I will be working on a computer science degree at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. I hope to use my time there to get a team together for early 2010's YC.",1205837902
139732,comment,138997,138997,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Solution: Re-brand IE as ""Microsoft Web Viewer"" or some such and start with a clean slate and a clean set of core libraries. All the version-checking routines will not discover IE, so the IE hacks will be irrelevant. MS gets a chance to leap-frog the competition by starting over (even though it's going to suck -- sometimes you just have to suck it up)<p>Or -- continue having a strategic plan that goes two directions at the same time.<p>BTW, this solution works for some of the other problems Microsoft is having. Once you give up the idea of trying to lock people into a brand name and start thinking about the best ways to provide solutions, you don't have these kinds of problems.",1205837826

Would you be happy if the FreeBSD ports tree had a magical ""make installbinaries"" command which would download and install binaries instead of building from the source code?",1205836417

139725,story,,,36,30,willphipps,"Ask YC: Any newbie coders?",,"About a year ago I started reading PG's essays and one thing that stood out was him saying 'if you don't know to code, learn to'. Since then I have had my head immersed in html/css/php/msql and nearly have something that works, looks good but would have probably cost me upto $10,000 (give or take) to create.<p>I just saw another post by someone that made an elearning site who has only been learning to code for 9 months.<p>Are there any newbie coders here? if so, have you got an app. and what language did you learn in?<p>I struggled with Ruby to begin with so moved onto php and found it a much easier language to get going on. Some people said to start with Python, i'd be interested in what  more experienced developers think are good languages to start off in, also any useful tips or resources for the newbie coder.<p>Cheerio..\nWill",1205834967

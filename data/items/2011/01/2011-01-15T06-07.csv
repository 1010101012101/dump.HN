If he has indeed become schizophrenic.<p>It might be worth pointing out that Dancho is far more intelligent and more educated than average, and so perhaps better able to moderate schizophrenia. Its symptoms may appear more subtle to observers, being filtered through a more rational intellect, which might make it more difficult to spot.<p>All of this is speculation of course and not terribly helpful without more information on Dancho's whereabouts and activities. I hope he's ok.",1295074721

It's like the iPhone is his own personal creation and that he is brutally beaten every time someone makes a call with an Android phone.  But the problem is ... it isn't, and he isn't.  He doesn't even work for Apple.<p>There is room in the marketplace for several types of phones.  The iPhone is for those who want a controlled experience where every i is dotted and every t is crossed.  Android is for people that are willing to live on the bleeding edge to be able to connect to their OpenVPN at home, even if it means their animations stutter a little bit because of GC.  It's also cheaper, which always picks up sales.<p>So why all this ultra-emotional hate?  It's just so <i>stupid</i>.  Buy the phone you like.  Develop apps on a platform you like.  If you change your mind, buy a different phone.<p>Let's debate which color is best.  I prefer green.  Anyone that likes any other color is clearly dumber than me.<p>This is stupid, right?  So why is it different when we are talking about pocket-sized telephones?",1295074553

correct ? It seems to me that the upper bound should be<p><pre><code>  O(<number of words> * <max word length>) ^2
</code></pre>
Looks like a typo.<p>In fact there is another fairly simple optimization one can make if one is interested only in computing the distance, but not interested in the actual edit sequence. If you look at the algorithm for filling up the table you will see you refer only to the previous row. So one can work with just two consecutive rows, thereby substantially reducing the space complexity, but not the time complexity unfortunately.<p>The time complexity can however be reduced on average to O(n * d), where n is the length of the longer word and d is the edit distance between the two words, this optimization is by Ukkonen. There have been other optimizations since then. The best I believe gives a time complexity of O(n + d^2)",1295072874

479708,comment,479631,479631,0,0,brk,,,"I've often viewed NDA's much like patents, they don't offer you any real protection.  They only offer mild discouragement to someone attempting to capitalize on something you created or invented.  An NDA (much like a patent) basically just gives you a strong edge should you choose to pursue something legally, YOU have to determine still if that battle is worth your time and money.<p>The above being said, it is still a good idea, IMO, to use NDA's (they're basically free) and patents when/where appropriate.",1234522077

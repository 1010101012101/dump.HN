Amazing kind of a theft that was-- Apple paid for a license to use that technology with stock which, if held to present, is worth Billions of dollars. Quite the heist!)<p>In one earlier post you were claiming Xerox didn't invent the GUI, and that Apple did, and now you're saying it was properly licensed? If you're accusing others of thinking one-sidedly, you need to look in the mirror.<p>>Another example: for quite a time there, many windows fans believed that Bill Gates owned Apple, because to them $150M is a big ""investment"" and they think Microsoft bought Apple in 1997. (they didn't know that Apple had a lot more of that in cash already, and that part of the deal-- the bigger part-- was burying the hatchet on all the patents microsoft was violating, to the tune of several billion dollars a year from Microsoft paid to Apple for several years. This latter bit was reported, but kept quiet because Apple didn't care and microsoft wanted to save face... so its not widely known.)<p>The biggest concession from Microsoft was that they made IE and MS Office for Mac, which kept Apple afloat for enough time to develop and launch OS X.<p>>was burying the hatchet on all the patents microsoft was violating, to the tune of several billion dollars a year from Microsoft paid to Apple for several years. This latter bit was reported, but kept quiet because Apple didn't care and microsoft wanted to save face... so its not widely known.)<p>What? Why would Apple lose billions a year for $150 million? That too wasn't a settlement but gave away actual shares of the company. If what you claim is true then Apple's management did a very crappy job and must be sued. And you say RDF doesn't exist. Like the Matrix, the ones under it's influence do not know they are in an RDF :)",1329288697

Large car-based ""cities"" aren't actually cities, they're just glorified urban office parks with people living in the suburbs: public transit will never work there efficiently.<p>The reason why you can't design a city is that a meaningful city can only grow organically based on whatever people happen to make of it.

People claim that Jobs can make you believe things that aren't true by simple application of charisma.""<p>I never saw the RDF in quite that light. It always seemed to me to be a way that Jobs could convince people that something was revolutionary, earth shattering, world changing...even when it wasn't (or at best, a well executed evolution built on previous ideas). It was the pinnacle of salesmanship -- turning customers into religious followers. Something to be admired and feared.<p>That's why the figurative iShitinabox was such an on target joke. The idea was that Jobs could have put shit in a box, but a diminutive ""i"" before the name and had people lined up around the block for a week before launch ready to buy it -- all swearing that it's going to change the world.<p>And always, nobody in that line was ever willing to just fess up that they were camped out in front of the Apple store because Jobs told them to be there and buy his stuff. On questioning, they would all say, and perhaps even think, that it was an original idea for them to go there and stand in that line -- and that they were especially smart and clever people for having arrived at that idea by themselves -- and this cleverness is supported by the other 500 clever smart people who are camped out a week before they can actually buy iShitinabox  -- or at least an amazing coincidence. <i>They're all different(ly thinking) in exactly the same way.</i><p>And then in the months following, there'll be some segment of that buying population that will, deep down, be dissatisfied in some way with their iShitinabox, but can't quite get the mental lens in focus to really notice it because the RDF has them in its grips, and they'll flood internet forums talking about how iShitinabox is the best thing in the history of things and will fight detractors to the death -- deflecting constructive criticism, covering over product flaws, giving testimonials about how their life has changed, start marginally successful businesses around the iShitinabox that would be more successful if they also sold almost their exact same product to the other 50% of the planet that doesn't think iShitinabox is a herald of the second coming.<p><i>That</i> is what Job's magic power was, his Reality Distortion Field.<p>It's not blind loyalty, that's wrong. The iProducts really are very good -- you get a damn fine product when you buy it. But it's the religious fervor that Jobs could generate, the obedience and recitation of the doctrine by Jobs -- bolstered by a tangible <i>thing</i> that you could point to.<p>What was it about Job's delivery that caused this to happen? I remember the first iPhone launch and people were lining up with stacks of thousands of dollars in <i>cash</i> so they could buy 20 or 30 of the phones at launch. People literally weeping in the street when the inventory was sold out and they couldn't get theirs. I've known at least a dozen people who bought every single iPod, iPhone and iPad like they were collecting Pokemon -- some even while barely making rent.<p>I know of at least one divorce over this phenomenon. After every keynote, my friend's husband would run out and buy pretty much one of everything that was put up for sale right after -- annihilating their savings for a new home.<p>I have a professor friend that literally can't control himself and spend thousands of dollars a month on subscriptions to various services and apps for his iProducts. In class, he will try and inappropriately push this stuff on his students like a born again preacher pushing the good news.<p>It's not a Field-of-Lies that comprised Job's Reality Distortion Field, but it's not really an innocent Field-of-Dreams either.",1329287339

All Wikipedia Editors Confirmed would be allowed to park in handicap parking spots and be given preference in matters of tenure at all educational institutions. Order would prevail, knowledge would be defended, und so weiter.<p>In another possible future a collection of bots will textmine wikipedia edits in realtime and many wikipedia janitors will rely on botscores to determine which edits are fraudulent. Advanced wikipedians will become cyborganisms devoted to spotting evidence of bad intent, their skills will be in high demand as corporate negotiatiors and wikipedia will languish as the cognitive bandwidth of it's most effective members is coopted into helping facebook fend off it's antitrust lawsuit and making the democratic parties stranglehold on national politics unassailable.<p>In another possible future it is revealed that Chris Poole is actually Jimmy Wales father due to bizarre accident involving a time machine and an ice cream sandwich, and that the entirety of the wikipedia project is in fact an elaborate troll designed to spell out a very rude word in babylonian when viewed from the right angle from three light years away.

Technical skills are in heavy demand now.<p>To understand what the problem actually is. You need to understand this. Just like the web boom in US, there was an IT boom in India. IT companies witnessed a 100% year on year growth. Their workforce head count was doubling every year. And they really had no other option but to hire people from every engineering back ground. They were forced to promote people regardless whether or not they deserved it.<p>People became managers within 5-6 years of joining industry. And that is when the meme spread <i>""Being a programmer doesn't help in IT you have to be a manager""</i>. We are long past those days now.<p>The growth has stabilized and I would rather say its completely normalized now. Companies are no longer feeling the need to promote people rapidly. In fact they now have a excess bench strength of managers. And many of them did get laid off in the past few years. Word has it that its going to very difficult for the managers from now on. As they bring little value to the table.<p>On the other hand the Indian IT industry is plagued by the disease of Job hopping. Absolute utter idiots who can't write a 10 line script now hop every year pocket a 30% raise get a promotion. You will see people who never wrote probably 1000 lines of code are now architects.<p>Given the scenario the operational efficiency of big IT companies has fallen like a pack of leaves. They are not taking high risk premium projects anymore. As they simply don't have the kind of good people to execute them.<p>The demand for good people is growing by the day. Most of them I know work at start up's or product firms or they are into consulting/freelancing. There is a lot of money there and there are a lot of tough good problems to be solved.<p>IT Industry in India is pretty much alive and rewarding, except that those rewards are no longer in big companies.

In fact I don't get a sense he likes them or 'got' Steve Jobs.<p>Hatchet job might be strong. But he dwells a lot on the charismatic and narcissistic and mercurial personality and not on why so many great people loved Jobs and worked so hard for him. Or what his insights about products and the business were (besides being a control freak and perfectionist).<p>The book is a good read, it's a creditable first draft of history, contains some first-hand stuff I never saw before about the genesis of the iPod and iPhone and iPad.<p>Isaacson gives the who, what, when, where, but doesn't really explain why. To his credit, he lets the people speak for themselves.<p>Jobs could have picked a lot of other people, but he picked a non-tech, non-business writer. I guess he wanted someone to just tell the story, not the strategy or product vision that makes Apple great.<p>Maybe Gruber should interview a bunch of people and give it a shot. It's not what Isaacson set out for or was in a position to do.",1329285761

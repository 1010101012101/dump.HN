[1]<p>It is the same thing in the sense that mathematically both are a complex (i.e., Real plus Imaginary) relationship between voltage and current. However, a transmission line is a two-port network while a capacitor is a one-port network, so these two senses of impedance correspond to different physical phenomena. In a capacitor, the impedance defines the relationship between voltage and current at the port (i.e., between the two terminals of the cap; this is sometimes called the driving point impedance). For a transmission line, the characteristic impedance defines, among other things, the equivalent impedance seen at one end of the line when the line is either infinitely long or an integral number of wavelengths long and terminated at the other end by an impedance of the same value as the characteristic impedance.<p>Instrument cables do indeed carry AC signals, inasmuch as the signal on the line corresponds to the frequency of the note(s) you're playing. AC is just ""non-zero frequency""---any signal which is not a constant, unchanging (DC) value is considered AC. So, 50/60Hz line power is an AC signal, the 2.4GHz signals used by your 802.11 network card are AC, and middle C (261.6 Hz) is AC.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_impedance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_impedance</a>",1309034819

And in particular the one I worked on got 15 year support guarantees from a couple of companies before they moved forward -- they don't want to do this effort every six weeks. They want to do it once, and be able to stay on it 6-10 years (if not longer)</i><p>I agree that this is how corporations operate. The reasoning is that IT is thought of as a necessary evil, ""lets just get it over with"". But this mindset has to change, just like a company wouldn't let their physical buildings fall apart, corporate IT systems need a proper maintenance mindset.<p>Why write <i>to</i> a browser? Everybody knows this is dumbheaded. Write to ""browsers"" and put in place a plan to keep the web-based software up-to-date with modern standards. It costs way more to build a new system, migrate over (in a multi-year migration process), then tear down the old system then to just keep your crap up-to-date with a maintenance staff.<p>It's akin to building a new office building after 5-6 years and moving everybody around, then tearing down the old building, because the county put a mandatory recycling program in place and the corporate trash policy didn't know what to do with the recycle bins. As a result the old office just filled up with glass bottles and aluminum cans...so they had to move to an empty office building...for the space.",1309032349

However, I bought my tickets way ahead of time for cheap, brought my own food, and did it because I wanted to see the country. I'd recommend everyone give it a try just once, it is certainly much better than my Greyhound experiences.<p>That said, there are glaring problems in the system. In El Paso, they forced everyone off the train and onto cramped shuttle buses all the way till San Antonio, less comfortable than Greyhound buses, asides the lack of crack smoke that is. And why? For track maintenance. Yet, they didn't inform anyone ahead of time that this was going to happen. This is in addition to the numerous stops of hours at a time where we would just sit, and of course not be informed why we were just sitting. In each case that I could determine, it would be because we were waiting on a freight train to pass. Amtrak has three major problems. One, they play second priority to freight rail, and thus trips become inconveniently long. Two, they are horribly mismanaged, which leads to the conductors not knowing what is going on. Three, the employees I have met at Amtrak have generally sucked in terms of customer service. I'm not surprised given they are working a dead-end job with poor management, but it's certainly one place that unionized, government subsidized labor hasn't led to stellar results.",1309032195

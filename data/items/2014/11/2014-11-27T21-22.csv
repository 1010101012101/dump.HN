Largely this is because the way the modules are defined makes it a snap to pre-compile aggressively.

8668870,comment,8668537,8668826,0,0,neltnerb,,,"One thing that served me incredibly well (finished from BS to Ph.D. in 4.5 years) was to very early on write a proposal that clearly stated exactly what question I would work on, and stating clearly what the approach and work product would be.<p>This all but eliminated feature creep, and I could then go back and say &quot;you agreed that investigating this was sufficient.&quot; Then it was just a matter of doing what I said I would do, and be done.<p>It helped focus my attention, because anything that didn&#x27;t address the thing in my proposal was more obviously tangential. It focused my entire course of research and kept me from spending too much time on side projects. But most importantly, it established in writing exactly what question I was going to answer and roughly how.<p>I didn&#x27;t say &quot;I&#x27;m going to prove that <foo> does <bar>.&quot; I said &quot;I&#x27;m going to test to see if <foo> does <bar>.&quot; If I do the tests, and show the relationship between <foo> and <bar> I&#x27;ve done science. The goal is to create an experimental plan that tests a theory, not to build the best whatever possible. The job of a Ph.D. student is to demonstrate that they can carry out research, not to build the best widget. If you can, great, but that&#x27;s not what a Ph.D. means.<p>I saw endless examples of people who waited until they had better data to put together a proposal. The problem with this approach is that it raises the bar by removing risk from the project. If you spend five years demonstrating the <foo> results in <bar> then your adviser will ask for you to spend another two years doing an actual project extending that result. If you clearly elucidate early on that it&#x27;s not clear that <foo> results in <bar> then simply seeing if that&#x27;s the case or not is often sufficient.<p>Formal proposals are like a contract between yourself and your committee establishing the scope of project that is sufficient to graduate. Doing this as early as possible can only help you, and in my experience any work prior to establishing the scope merely results in a larger scope later.",1417125191

When David Beazley looked back on the GIL-less patch for CPython 1.4[0] he measured performance hits of 4x~7x.<p>Though in the case of CPython most of the cost comes from the refcounting.

It&#x27;s not too strong to say that most academics will flat-out lie to students about what they need do. Although this &quot;lying&quot; is frequently the result of inattention of misunderstanding its effects are indistinguishable from malice.<p>So don&#x27;t be shy about getting very concrete and specific with your committee, including the kind of analysis you want to do, the theoretical framework you want to apply, etc. This is all easier in the sciences--humanities PhD programs are basically abuse factories (<a href=""http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1588)--but"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1588)--but</a> even in the sciences it is all too common to see students get misled by their supervisor and/or committee, who give guidance in one direction one month and a completely different direction the next.<p>One further piece of advice with regard to a clear thesis question: I&#x27;ve often found it useful to ask students &quot;What&#x27;s the title of your dissertation?&quot; This just a more concrete way of asking about their thesis question, but it&#x27;s much harder to fool yourself about. &quot;Well, I&quot;m investigating blah blah blah...&quot; may look like an answer to the question &quot;What&#x27;s your thesis question?&quot; but it frequently can&#x27;t be reduced to &quot;Experimental Investigation of Blah Using Blah Models and Blah Theories&quot;.<p>Finally, it isn&#x27;t just your own perfectionism you have to watch out for. My iron rule for when a dissertation is finished is: the very first time your advisor tells you to change A to B in draft N, and then tells you to change B back to A in draft M &gt; N, you are done. Your resistance to making further changes should go up factorially at that point, because your advisor has stopped paying attention or has become obsessed with minutia, and if given a free rein will continue to fiddle around indefinitely.

But, the story is what I&#x27;m very thankful for this year:<p>I don&#x27;t have any directly related advice but let me give you some advice anyways. About a year ago I asked this subreddit for help on starting a niche website that would compete with the likes of Etsy, Ebay, Tindie, and Amazon. I was working as a body shop manager at the time and knew absolutely nothing about web development, programming, or anything particularly tech-related. Of course, I got a lot of flack from our fellow redditors. So, after feeling a bit beat down, I tried to take their negative comments as inspiration and began learning as much as I could about web development. Now, just a year later, I&#x27;m working as web dev for a large multi-national firm that makes a substantial impact in some major aspects of the web. I&#x27;m much happier, living in a new awesome city, and making significantly more money than I was this time last year in result. I haven&#x27;t realized my original idea that began this journey of mine but, none the less, the dream made a huge difference in my future. So, whatever you do, please, please, PLEASE don&#x27;t let anyone here degrade your ambition.

</code></pre>
You want to get all the URLs that are 404s, but you don&#x27;t care about who requested them, etc. You could do this:<p><pre><code>    _, _, _, url, returncode, _ = logline.split(&#x27; &#x27;)

There&#x27;s no special behaviour for _ in this case; in fact, normally in the interactive interpreter it&#x27;s used to store the result of the last evaluated line, like so:<p><pre><code>    >>> SomeModel.objects.all()
    [SomeModel(…), SomeModel(…), SomeModel(…), …]
    >>> d = _
    >>> print d
    [SomeModel(…), SomeModel(…), SomeModel(…), …]

There were no multi-decadal mega-droughts, no dramatic swings in northern hemisphere temperatures of the kind seen in the Little Ice Age or the Medieval Warm Period, and so on.<p>It follows from this that even a return to natural variability is going to be challenging for us, and it&#x27;s unlikely that the 1.6 W/m^2 that anthopogenic greenhouse gasses are adding to the mix is going to make things any calmer. Adding energy to chaotic systems rarely makes them more stable, and while the detailed consequences of the additional energy are unclear (despite what the &quot;science is settled&quot; folks claim) there is very little doubt that we are adding 1 - 2 W/m^2 to the Earth&#x27;s energy budget.<p>That said, here&#x27;s a relatively agnostic argument for carbon taxes, which the data show are pretty effective at curtailing greenhouse emissions: most carbon tax schemes are designed such that the revenue they generate allows governments to lower corporate taxes and person income taxes.

You should be able to produce roughly one published article a year [0]. When you have 3-4 published or near published articles, take them and put them together into a dissertation.<p>Most universities will allow this and it&#x27;s the approach to developing a dissertation that minimizes your risk (you don&#x27;t bet everything on one experiment, you minimize the risk of last minute critiques and requests for changes, etc...).<p>[0] This might seem intimidating when you start out, but if you want a promising future in academia you will eventually need to be producing 5, 10 or more articles a year (with admittedly a lot of collaboration and assistance from other). Setting a strict goal of one article a year as a grad student should be obtainable in most fields and get you on the right track. It will also force you to be disciplined and to produce.

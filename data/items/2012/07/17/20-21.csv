Not at all, it is because we have the genetic programming to develop huge brains.  The difference in intelligence between humans and squirrels is determined almost entirely by heredity.<p>The reason I point this out is that it is very common to see comments about heredity not being a factor in human intelligence.  It may well be that heredity does not explain differences in intelligence between two humans, or it may be that heredity almost completely explains any differences in intelligence among humans.  Science will eventually figure out the truth of the matter.  However, heredity plays a very dominant role in determining intelligence, the only question is whether humans are all so genetically similar with regards to intelligence that environmental factors dominate genetic factors.<p>EDIT: The way I phrased the first paragraph sets up a false choice.  Intelligence differences among humans could be hereditary, environmental, or most likely a complex combination of the two.",1342558790

And there it was done routinely: children were encouraged to challenge everything, and you sort of worked on your own, you were supposed to think things through for yourself -- it was a real experience. And it was quite a striking change when it ended and I had to go to the city high school, which was the pride of the city school system. It was the school for academically-oriented kids in Philadelphia -- and it was the dumbest, most ridiculous place I've ever been, it was like falling into a black hole or something. For one thing, it was extremely competitive -- because that's one of the best ways of controlling people. So everybody was ranked, and you always knew exactly where you were: are you third in the class, or maybe did you move down to fourth? All this stuff is put into people's heads in various ways in the schools -- that you've got to beat down the person next to you, and just look out for yourself.""</i><p>Ok, raised by teachers/scholars who even ran a school system, and went to a school which cultivated critical thinking.

He complains about getting assaulted.<p>> What we don't know is what really happened between him and the staff other than his account of it.<p>If he haven't assaulted anyone then this is irrelevant. IMHO as always.<p>> I very seriously doubt that someone resorted to physically attacking him out of nowhere (as he seems to present it) without some provocation.<p>I have my close friends very recent account of exactly that kind of situation. She was walking on the sidewalk with her 9mo baby in a stroller. There was a truck across the sidewalk standing and waiting to enter the property via gate that was wide open. She asked the driver to move but he refused. He said he has delivery to make here but he has to wait in front of open gate because the woman who lives here is crazy. Since the curb was high and road wide she decided to wait to talk to the women about the guy at her service blocking the sidewalk. As the women came my friend entered her property and started talking to the women. Women said ""Get the f<i>ck out."", my friend said ""Wait a moment!"" then the women grabbed my friend and her stroller and pulled her inside (fortunately baby was properly secured in the stroller otherwise he might fall out during the struggle). Woman told my friend ""So now stay here!"" locked the gate and walked a way. My friend was in shock and called the Police. As she was talking to the Police the woman yelled again ""Get the f</i>ck out."" and after a while opened the gate. Police came, my friend described the whole situation. Police asked my friend if she wants to formally charge the woman with assault or if she just wants theem to scare her little bit. My friend chose the second option. In her own words, her world view got seriously shaken that day.<p>I hope that you'll never experience first-hand that physical attack by ordinary people is not always reasonably provoked.<p>Disclaimer: Story didn't happen in the US. No ""my home is may castle"" here. If you leave the door open anyone can get in and you can only ask them to leave or call the Police to make them leave.",1342558374

4257813,comment,4256302,4257551,1,0,slurgfest,,,"App Engine just isn't intended or designed for that kind of interaction with services. Take memcache as an example.<p>On a VPS, you install an OS package and manage memcached as any daemon. You are editing the configs and compiling your own binaries if you want. Set it up on a separate box if you want. Set up a bunch of memcached boxes if you want. Do the wiring how you want. It's up to you and you handle all the details and you are billed by time. Handle it correctly and it's crazy fast.<p>On Heroku, there is a layer of abstraction which makes this more like 'give me 3 instances of memcached'. You are billed by the service-instance, essentially. You get help making things work well out of the box. But at a lower level it isn't too different from running deploy scripts to set up EC2 boxes. They just provide the scripts and sell you the resources and support at the same time.<p>On App Engine, Google runs a clustered memcache service for you. It is always running and there is no service setup. It is already on a scalable distributed configuration, not necessarily the fastest or cheapest but good; micro-optimizing memcache servers is not even intended as a supported use case. There is a ton of Google secret sauce involved, behind the scenes you are connecting to some cluster with RPC, all you know is the simple API interface they give you. You are billed based on how much you use it.<p>I think I can predict confidently that GAE is never going to expose an interface where you allocate individual memcached instances. That kind of interaction with services just isn't the App Engine way. Google has Compute Engine for the cases where you want EC2 style control of what is going on at the per-service level.<p>If you  want to run your own App Engine platform you can try AppScale. (I never met anyone who does.) It is a whole prescribed architecture and it is not likely to be changed to become more like Heroku.",1342558271

Depending on how early stage my company is, I might favor someone who has more startup experience, is more passionate about our goal, is capable of doing more than just the job description, has the proper culture fit, and is willing to work more than 9-5. I'd be looking for employee #1 or 2, which is very different than employee #50. Headhunters, although I've never tried them either, might not be a whole lot better/worse.<p>You also run the risk of misaligned incentives. Ideally, you'd want to have industry professionals who know your industry and can evaluate employees properly, but aren't your competitors. Otherwise, they might try to poach your best candidates or recommend subpar ones.<p>There's also the misaligned financial incentive for headhunters in general. If they get paid every time you hire someone they recommend, it's in their best interest that you hire sooner rather than later to maximize their revenue/time spent.<p>How you brand or productize this service can bypass some of these risks. Just some concerns to think about.<p>An interesting thought: If you have a marketplace with resumes and ratings, the top-rated candidates will be approached much more frequently. This'll make them harder to hire and give them the power to negotiate better terms.

This is done by calling lsblk -l (easier to parse than fdisk) and looking for non-mounted partitions. It outputs:<p><pre><code>  NAME MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO MOUNTPOINT\n  sr0   11:0    1  49.8M  0 /media/VBOXADDITIONS_4.1.18_78361\n  sda    8:0    0     8G  0 \n  sda1   8:1    0   7.5G  0 /\n  sda2   8:2    0     1K  0 \n  sda5   8:5    0   510M  0 [SWAP]\n</code></pre>\n4) MDADM's command parameter is the following:<p>sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=10 --chunk=256 --raid-devices=$RNUM $DRIVES<p>Where $RNUM is an integer corresponding to the number of drives, and $DRIVES is a space-separated list of the paths to the unmounted drives (which should probably further be filtered on size, since one of them is only 1K but let's ignore its size for now). We also have to remember to prefix '/dev/' since that is where the drives are mounted onto. So explicitly:<p>DRIVES=/dev/sda /dev/sda2\nRNUM=2<p>Which then makes:<p>5) sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=10 --chunk=256 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda /dev/sda2<p>Notes: \na) I've been able to accomplish this using node, since in JS I can just do things like string.split("" "") and get an array which I can loop through, or split on newlines, or whatever. But I don't know how this is accomplished in bash scripting.<p>Thanks for helping out somebody very unintelligent with respect to CLI, despite the last year and a half being fully involved, and trying to google the help out of every issue and tutorials.

(Until the popping overtakes the adding, which happens around about the time when a typical newly explored pixel generates fewer than 2 new neighbours to explore, by which time most of the interesting pattern generation has already happened.)<p>Now, when any pixel is processed its (not-yet-visited) neighbours get pushed consecutively. That means that when the exploration process reaches them it'll only explore one or two of them. In the usual ""early"" case there are three such neighbours; half the time one will get explored, half the time two will. The other neighbours get left behind until the exploration wraps (i.e., ""step"" passes the end of the queue), which doesn't happen for ages.<p>Hence the branching tree structure you see: right at the start we explore only two of the starting pixel's four neighbours, and the other two get left behind; so now we have two growing ""tips"", and when we process each one we either grow it one step further or split it two ways. And we don't return to the other neighbours for ages, so the tree grows basically until it fills the available space before the gaps start getting filled in.<p>(There are plenty of details not explained by the above.

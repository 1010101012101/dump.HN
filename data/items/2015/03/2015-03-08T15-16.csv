Let&#x27;s divide the 3 mb file into 1000 parts, each having a ~3k size. Take sha256 hash of all 1000 parts and sha256 hash of the actual file. The size of these hashes are less than the actual file + leaves ample room for a decompressor. Now start brute-forcing and assume we have all the run-time power and time. Would the probability of collision happening in all 1000 parts be very low then ? Given a good hashing function could it be so low that we can disregard it ? If 1000 is not enough, can we increase the splits to 2000 or 3000 ?",1425830280

The platform is built on top of Amazon Web Services and utilizes Docker to provide users with a sysops-free way to manage complex database and application architectures.<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Relocation assistance, if you want to move to NYC.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f72d1f9/apply?lever-source=HackerNews",1425830056

As a side project I built an e-commerce recommendation engine part time over 2-3 months.  I didn&#x27;t want to build out a massive product database and I didn&#x27;t want to ask users to fill out lengthy profiles so I leveraged existing product and social APIs to handle both. It wasn&#x27;t very difficult to get something that worked reasonably well - though competing solutions were mostly far worse so maybe I&#x27;m selling myself short. In the end it was decently well received (had some press, good user feedback, thousands of initial users) but it failed as a standalone business. Cost of customer acquisition vs customer lifetime value just wasn&#x27;t there. I&#x27;ve seen no one else succeed in the space so I think the net takeaway is what I referenced at the top - it&#x27;s really more of a feature than a standalone product.

If a comedian says he&#x27;s going to kill someone, nobody is going to prosecute him. Threats have to be creditable. The tweets posted by Kurt all make some reference to his baseball career and then try to use that to make sexual jokes about his daughter. They are just terrible jokes and should be socially ostracized, but we should not be using the legal system to punish these kinds of tweets. The line is too unclear. None of the posted tweets contain any serious threat that doesn&#x27;t contain some baseball innuendo, at least the ones Kurt published. There is a difference if someone said e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m going to rape your daughter when she gets here&quot; and that tweeter lives in the town of the school. One might be able to consider that creditable. We don&#x27;t prosecute people who make others scared, we prosecute people that we believe have a creditable chance of harming another human being.",1425829435

You probably confuse people saying your reaction to these comments is extreme with people defending the comments.

And that career can be long enough that competencies are likely to change in unpredictable ways over your career. So, it makes some sense for graduate employers to be more interested in an education they believe means you are likely adapt well to those changes, and perhaps lead those changes. Rather than a competency certification that shows you know the current state-of-play.<p>Whether that will change over time is an interesting question. If the market does move towards just certifying competencies, I have an awkward suspicion that it will be because of general trends towards workforce casualisation. If you see employees as disposable (hire the skills of today, and tomorrow fire them to hire the skills of tomorrow) then education is less important than today&#x27;s competency.<p>This isn&#x27;t intended as a criticism of MOOCs, nor in any sense to diminish them. I&#x27;m not only interested in them, but trying to develop some -- I have something of a vested interest towards MOOCs... It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m personally more interested in how we can improve MOOCs to offer an education, rather than how we can get the market to stop demanding an education and just want a competency-certification.",1425826928

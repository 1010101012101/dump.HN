The brain does not do straight math like computers do.<p>Most of what we think we know of ""consciousness"" is based on estimation and assumption, but from the very best research out there we know that the brain is a molecular machine. Through a system made of billions of neurons interacting through neurotransmitters and electrical/molecular forces, we end up with processes like Long Term Potentiation (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation</a>) for memory.<p>Negative feedback loops (for hormones), neurotransmitter synthesis, LTP, and ""thought"" do not come from mathematical calculation performing a set of predetermined functions (like software)-- they come from molecules governed by the forces of physics leading to a system designed by the processes of evolution.",1215190192

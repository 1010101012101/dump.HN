I admit it, I&#x27;m biased on a lot of levels, not really against gender, but I will admit I prefer to work with men.  That said, doing pre-screening of applications at a job a few years ago opened my eyes a lot.<p>To be honest, I no longer hold much of any value to a resume...  I&#x27;ve seen too many people with higher degrees and years of experience that can&#x27;t seem to do what it says they can on said resume.  Me, I&#x27;m particularly bad at white board coding... but I understand the need.

For the most part, I appreciate that women tend to be much more accurate on their resumes and in responses as to their skill level.  I&#x27;ve never really liked excessive arrogance, and prefer someone more honest.  This is just me though.<p>I also think that efforts to make language and interactions politically correct are a disservice to the goal of letting anyone that wants to work in IT do so.  A few months back I witnessed someone pretty much accosted because he dared to ask, &quot;...can any of you guys help me with this?&quot;.

We&#x27;re at a point where awareness is increasing, but as a society we&#x27;ve also been heading down a path of so much excessive sensitivity that it&#x27;s downright abusive towards people who aren&#x27;t ill-meaning.

Single figures suggest homogeneity and that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.<p>The UK is not the US. There are totally different cultural forces at play. I&#x27;m half British and all my aunts do most of the housework. My female and male cousins are one generation younger and share homemaking responsibilities with their male/female counterparts. The effect is stronger for those that live in larger cities. I&#x27;ve also live in China and Brazil. The homemaking habits of either country are not in the least bit applicable to the US.<p>Even within the US, there are big differences between California (where I live now) and North Carolina (where I went to school and college). Many of my classmates that stayed in Raleigh-Durham area have lifestyles where women are likely to handle homemaking responsibilities relative to those that left the region to live in places like SF, NYC and LA.<p>Here in the Bay Area, it&#x27;s even more extreme. I wouldn&#x27;t assume that any of the women I encounter does any more or less housework than any of the men I encounter.<p>Since all this talk is about the SF Bay Area and regions that aren&#x27;t the least bit comparable in terms of homemaking activities.

Laundry you can do once a week to every two weeks. You can get a roomba. You have services like homejoy to take care of the heavy duty chores like cleaning the bathrooms, mopping floors and cleaning the kitchen. I&#x27;m one of the few people I know that actually handles such chores themselves instead of hiring help to do it.

I can&#x27;t <i>possibly</i> stress that enough.<p>I&#x27;ve spent about ten years working a couple of tech jobs. Over those years, I&#x27;ve probably put in a few hundred hours of OT (unpaid or otherwise). If we&#x27;re pessimistic and call it an even 1k hours of OT, this means that I&#x27;ve spent an average of somewhere between 42 and 45 hours per week at work over my entire career so far.<p>I -and others in tech that I know- have never been required to work anywhere near point of burnout, let alone breakdown. Moreover, from what I understand of tech sector hiring practices during the Dot Com Era, anyone who could spell SQL and/or HTML could get a well-paying job in the industry.<p><i>Maybe</i> those practices also included a near-universal culture of overwork, but -based on what I hear from a few folks who were working in The Valley at the time- I&#x27;m pretty certain that that&#x27;s not true. If management was pressuring you to work those insane hours, you would have very probably found better treatment at another company. It seems like the lower hiring bar would have given a seasoned veteran quite some mobility during the boom. The situation after the bust is another story all together.<p>Since you stopped working in the industry in 2003 and claim over 25 years of industry experience, would you be so kind compare and contrast the work ethic and attitudes of tech company management during the Dot Com boom of the late 1990s to those of tech company management during the PC Boom of the 1980s and very early 1990s?<p>Thanks!",1438068967
9960026,comment,9959451,9959883,0,0,yason,,,"Credit cards are used because they allow for global money transactions in much the same way debit cards do locally in your home country. For example, it&#x27;s practically impossible to fly into USA, rent a car, and book a hotel for a week unless you have a credit card that has several thousand dollars of credit. Even if you have the very same money on your bank account. The system just works that way.<p>But credit card debt is way overrated. You basically have to have that money anyway (roughly in a month) so that you can pay off the credit card bill. In the average, you can use a credit card to spend your next salary beforehand but that leaves you with nothing to live on the following month. So what you can do with a credit card is rather limited, as if you do <i>not pay off</i> the debt in one month, you&#x27;re in for some serious interest rates until the balance comes back close to zero again.<p>Debt is useful when you invest in something that will produce better yield than the interest on the debt. For example, buying an apartment generally will immediately lower your cost of living (in comparison to rent) and subsequently frees more money to pay back the debt and interest. Thus, taking a mortgage makes sense if you can pay it back in a reasonable time so that the proportion of interest won&#x27;t accumulate into too high in the grand totals.<p>Then again, buying a new car with a loan makes no sense whatsoever. The value of the car will only degrade and it might actually degrade faster than the rate you&#x27;re paying off the debt.",1438068937

9959987,comment,9959451,9959883,0,0,MaxScheiber,,,"Credit and debit cards are the easiest way to pay in America, since bank transfers are not really an option for merchants. It&#x27;s really uncommon to pay by check at the point of sale (to the extent where people might respond negatively), and cash is actually pretty inconvenient in the US due to odd-even pricing tactics giving everyone pockets full of small coins.<p>Most people would agree that the most intelligent way to use a credit card is to treat it as a debit card and never incur a balance. Instead, you&#x27;d pay each month&#x27;s bill in full. This way, you pay no interest on your debt; in fact, you are effectively incurring zero debt. Moreover, a lot of credit cards offer rewards programs in terms of cash back or &quot;points&quot; as a percentage of your expenditures. With some mixing and matching of cards, you can easily get 2-3% cash back on your aggregate purchases, or rack up some free airline flights.<p>I actually find this to be a huge moral gray area; the reason that Visa, Discover, and MasterCard can afford to pay out handsome rewards is partly because of the financially illiterate charging more to their credit cards than they can afford to pay off. [1] I don&#x27;t have the exact numbers on me, but I think interest versus merchant fees was about a 67%-33% split in terms of credit card company revenue. (American Express is an exception because they do not allow you to carry a balance on a lot of their cards; they will report your account as delinquent and terminate service.)<p>Otherwise, as other posters have mentioned, credit cards offer fraud protection. Cards aimed at people with good credit scores often come with other nice benefits, such as additional reimbursement if an airline loses your bag.<p>[1] There <i>are</i> valid reasons to place a huge charge that you can&#x27;t afford to pay off immediately. Emergencies do happen, for instance, and it&#x27;s really great to have a line of credit for that situation. But then your credit card serves the same purpose as a traditional loan.",1438068187

That&#x27;s great, but it does nothing for the web.<p>The web is about documents composed almost entirely of text (yes, with tags referring to images), linked to other documents composed entirely of text.  When you break that, <i>you break the web</i>.<p>When you require me to execute untrusted code in order to read text <i>you break the web, and my security</i>.<p>There are some really neat things which can be done with JavaScript and single-page apps.  <i>But they are not the web</i>.",1438067159

That said, if you are the type who thinks credit card is &#x27;free money&#x27; stay away from it -- you will be trapped in debt forever. If you are generally good with managing your expenses, I would say get a &#x27;bank card&#x27; (like Citi, Chase, etc.) and put it on Auto Pay to pay it off in full each month. If your limit on the card is low (say $1,000) then try not to spend more than $300 each month (30% utilization) as it is better for your credit score to keep your utilization low.<p>You will be bombarded with 0% Balance Transfer offers and stay away from those unless you are knowledgeable about this game.

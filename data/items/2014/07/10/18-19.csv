8016499,comment,8015459,8015833,1,0,eridius,,,"What incentive is there for Uber to do this? Remember, they&#x27;re a for-profit company, not a public service. If Uber didn&#x27;t take a surge pricing cut, then the only reason they have to use surge pricing is to maximize the number of rides on the road. And that&#x27;s certainly something they could do, as more rides == more money. But they&#x27;d be leaving money on the table that way, and as a for-profit company, there&#x27;s very little incentive to do that. You stated that it would make surge pricing more defensible, which is basically the only reasonable incentive I can think of, but obviously Uber believes that it&#x27;s in their interests to make more money than to have a stronger moral defense for surge pricing.<p>So I guess the real question is, for those of you who believe Uber should behave this way (and, w4, I recognize that you&#x27;re merely explaining modeless&#x27;s argument, not claiming you agree with it), do you believe Uber should be <i>expected</i> to behave this way, given that they are a for-profit company, or do you believe that it is merely the *right thing to do (for some ambiguously-defined moralistic definition of &quot;right&quot;)? I suspect that what you really believe is that it&#x27;s what you personally think should happen, because it would result in lower surge prices for the same supply, and you would like to pay less money. And that&#x27;s not a very compelling argument.",1405018798

8016434,comment,8015459,8016371,2,0,eridius,,,"NYC already has plenty of taxis. I would expect Uber to only really be used there either as a) a luxury black car service, or b) a convenient taxi dispatch service. It sounds like you&#x27;re talking about them as if they&#x27;re purely the latter. Surely they&#x27;re acting as both? They could also be c) a cheaper alternative to cabs (as UberX), which is what UberX actually is here in SF, but I don&#x27;t know if UberX exists everywhere or operates the same way everywhere (laws regarding car services are likely to not be that different everywhere, but UberX exists in a much more grey area that I can very much believe doesn&#x27;t work everywhere; plus, it doesn&#x27;t make as much sense when there&#x27;s already enough taxis to go around).<p>As a luxury black car service, everything I&#x27;ve already said stands.<p>Ax a taxi dispatch service, I wouldn&#x27;t expect really anything I know about Uber to apply. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect surge pricing to apply either, because when Uber acts as a taxi dispatch service, you&#x27;re still just paying the regular taxi fare (with the caveat that Uber guarantees a 20% (I think) tip instead of leaving it up to the passenger). And if surge pricing doesn&#x27;t apply, then neither does the claim that drivers cancel when surge pricing is going up.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware, the main reason for a taxi to cancel is because of laws requiring that taxis can&#x27;t say no to a street fare, even if they&#x27;re being dispatched to pick up someone else. This is the same reason why it can take a while to get a taxi to show up when calling the dispatcher directly, and using Uber to request a pickup shouldn&#x27;t alter that at all. Of course, I could be misinformed about how that law works, but that&#x27;s my understanding of it. (And of course the taxi driver could have other personal reasons for canceling, but surge pricing isn&#x27;t one of them).<p>On this note, the $4 for canceling fee actually makes some sense, if we assume Uber was unable to successfully recruit enough cab drivers with the model of Uber being paid a flat fee for each ride. Uber still benefits by having taxi dispatch services in its app, because that means it becomes the one-stop app for people who need car-based transportation, and once you have them in the app you might convince them to go with the real Uber services. And the $4 cancellation penalty encourages drivers to not cancel, which in the absence of a rating system (which I don&#x27;t believe Uber has for taxis, nor could it really enforce due to e.g. taxis being driven by someone other than the owner) is the only real way to incentivize drivers to not cancel.",1405018205

Surge pricing doesn&#x27;t merely raise supply to meet demand, it also suppresses demand to meet supply. In the latter case, there are fewer rides going around than there would with an infinite supply, so if Uber doesn&#x27;t take a cut of the surge pricing themselves, then they&#x27;re missing out on money they would have had without the suppressed demand.<p>Perhaps you think they deserve to make less money, but as wutbrodo pointed out, the lack of supply at these times does not mean Uber has failed at recruiting drivers. After all, having extra drivers sitting around idle is not helpful to anyone (not to Uber, not to the drivers themselves, and not to the passengers). The only mechanism Uber has for putting more drivers on the road when demand increases is to adjust prices. Theoretically they could merely reduce their cut to put more drivers on the road without increasing the cost to passengers, but there&#x27;s no incentive for them to do that<i>.<p>Ultimately, what you said would make sense if drivers were actually Uber employees that operated at the direction of Uber. In that scenario, Uber could order more drivers onto the road without surge pricing. But that&#x27;s not the case, drivers are voluntary contractors that make the decision themselves about whether to start working. The only tool Uber has to influence how many drivers start working is to increase their pay, and the only way to do that</i>* is to turn on surge pricing. And since surge pricing acts to reduce demand in addition to increasing supply, the only way Uber itself has an incentive to use surge pricing is if Uber itself gets more money that way (which means taking a cut of the surge-boosted price instead of the original price).<p>I&#x27;ll grant you that if Uber was a regulated service operating on behalf of the public, then perhaps it makes sense to penalize them for not adequately meeting demand. And in such a scenario, surge pricing can&#x27;t be justified anyway, so the natural penalty of not filling as many rides as there is demand for would suffice. But Uber is a for-profit company, offering what is essentially a luxury good, and the only arguments that really have any bearing on Uber&#x27;s behavior are economic ones.<p><i>it&#x27;s possible that there are times when it makes sense to do that, e.g. when surge pricing is already on and raising it further will suppress demand enough that they won&#x27;t make as much money. It&#x27;s possible that reducing their cut could increase driver supply enough to make up for the difference (due to more rides happening). But I don&#x27;t know if this is ever true in practice.<p></i>*short of reducing their cut, as mentioned previously, but there&#x27;s no incentive to do this instead of surge pricing",1405017604

Everyone loves to drum their chest about capitalism but in this case it isn&#x27;t working, and ISPs have clearly colluded to divvy up the territories so they aren&#x27;t directly competing.<p>The internet has become a public utility just like electricity, water, or the roads. Businesses and private citizens depend on it day to day, and economic growth is hampered by poor performance in this area (e.g. new types of businesses that depend on bandwidth, like a Netflix competitor, cannot exist if the pipes are slow).<p>In my view the raw cable and fibre should be confiscated from the big three by the government using eminent domain, and then rented out to competing ISPs (including the big three) on even footing. The rent would pay to maintain the cables/fibre and deploy more network, and the ISPs could add a premium before reselling it to end users to cover support costs and maintaining equipment (e.g. routers, edge connections, etc).<p>Basically make the final mile public property.

Our application is large enough that loading everything at once (even concatenated/minified/gzipped) doesn&#x27;t make sense, but RequireJS/the r.js optimizer made it really easy to both figure out our usage pattern and consolidate our core set of modules. The process we use creates a different version of our app script for each entry page, and then each page has its own separate module that can be loaded on navigation.",1405017151

It doesn&#x27;t make so much sense when talking about a luxury item.<p>So the question is, how do you see Uber? I love Uber because it&#x27;s practically impossible to get a cab in SF, but I don&#x27;t view Uber as a <i>necessity</i>. It&#x27;s still basically a luxury car service, no matter how popular it is. If it gets large enough to cause the regular cabs to actually start disappearing, then I&#x27;ll agree it&#x27;s moving into the &quot;necessity&quot; space (as it will be supplanting the existing regulated supply of transportation), but until that happens, I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to demand an auction.<p>As an analogy, if a natural disaster hits and prevents stores from restocking their milk, AIUI the existing laws prevent them from raising the price on milk in return (as it&#x27;s generally considered a necessity). But what about the hippy organic store down the block, that sells more expensive cruelty-free, organic, locally-sourced milk? Seems like a bit of a luxury good to me, and I would not have a problem with prices being raised on that particular milk, because I can always go to the grocery store and buy the regular milk like everyone else. Of course, I don&#x27;t know how the law actually treats this particular scenario (and I am rather curious).",1405016636

At IndexTank I routinely averted multi-week efforts (saving lots of late night hacking) because I realized that their potential value to the company would have been marginal at best. It&#x27;s true that there are times when a team needs to fix something ASAP, which may require 24-48 hours of near-constant work. However, this should not be the norm.<p>In the long run, having a team where everyone works insane hours leads to burnout, turnover, and monoculture (i.e. mostly twentysomethings without family commitments).

But there&#x27;s no numbers on total bandwidth. For example, if Verizon has 100Gbps to Netflix&#x27;s content providers, and only 40Gbps to their other content providers, then the additional 20Gbps is going to be a drop in the bucket.<p>It could be the reverse: Netflix is choosing the 40Gbps provider where they could be choosing the 100Gbps, in which case they could easily triple the available bandwidth they have to send to Verizon.<p>But, we all know that&#x27;s not the real issue.<p>Finally, if peak utilization means that netflix is saturating the router with reduced bitrate video, then increasing that could very well lead to saturation in the internal Verizon network.<p>EDIT:<p>I ran some numbers. If Netflix&#x27;s providers are saturating at 100%, and other providers are only at 44% peak, and then peak incoming traffic is exiting the Verizon router at 56% peak, that should roughly mean that Netflix has roughly 3.6x the amount of bandwidth from &quot;other transit providers&quot; than it does from Netflix&#x27;s transit providers, which, in turn, means that Verizon has roughly 2x the total bandwidth that Netflix uses available on it&#x27;s network. What isn&#x27;t mentioned is what percentage Netflix uses of it&#x27;s current providers, how those &quot;other providers&quot; are split up, the maximum theoretical utilization, etc...<p>What isn&#x27;t mentioned is how that&#x27;s split up. It&#x27;s probable Netflix can&#x27;t use on most of those links even if they wanted to, and there&#x27;s no word on how many links there are. If it was one giant link, and Netflix could use on it, sure, Netflix should probably try to do that.<p>Bottom line: I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything technically limiting Verizon&#x27;s capacity to Netflix&#x27;s transit providers, as according to their numbers, Netflix&#x27;s transit providers only constitute ~22% of the total bandwidth into Verizon. Down the line, it&#x27;s probable that, even if these link issues were fixed at the border router, they would pop back up again in the Metro Area router or aggregation router, and really gum up Verizon&#x27;s network.",1405016321

And is this actually true? I haven&#x27;t heard any stories of this happening before.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware, it&#x27;s a violation of Uber policies for a driver to cancel without a good reason. My believe was that Uber checks up on every driver cancellation, but perhaps they only do that if the customer complains. Certainly I&#x27;ve complained before when I got cancelled on (unrelated to surge pricing).<p>> That works when the driver is the one who the Uber account belongs to, but if you&#x27;ve ever used Uber in NYC you&#x27;ll know that a driver will often just rent out his cab + phone to another driver.<p>Really? Wow, I&#x27;ve never seen that happen before.. I would expect that to be an extremely serious violation of Uber&#x27;s terms of services, as jljljl said. Certainly if I ever got picked up by a driver that was not the one listed in the Uber app, I&#x27;d file a complaint with Uber, and would consider not even getting in the car.<p>> Also wanted to add that Uber&#x27;s business model in NYC is that the service is free to taxi drivers<p>Are you talking about the Taxi calling functionality in Uber, rather than the actual Uber or UberX service? Because that&#x27;s quite different. I didn&#x27;t think surge pricing even affected the regular taxi functionality. Of course, my experience with Uber is in SF, so it&#x27;s certainly plausible that the model works differently in NYC, though I would be surprised to hear that. Also, $4 when they cancel a booking? That doesn&#x27;t sound like a good model, are you sure that&#x27;s how it works? In SF with the taxi functionality my understanding was they simply charged a flat fee for each taxi ride (which is taken out of the guaranteed 20% tip to the driver).",1405016162

8016194,comment,8015470,8015850,2,0,x1798DE,,,"The current largest danger, when it comes to passwords, is offline attacks on compromised databases, your computer, etc. Online attacks are much less of a problem because the server can (and hopefully does) throttle the number of times you can try - if you&#x27;re limited to 100 tries, then it&#x27;s pretty easy to create a password that won&#x27;t be in the first 100 things a hacker will guess.<p>For offline attacks, if the password is stored using something relatively insecure like SHA256 (which is not compromised, it&#x27;s just too fast), it&#x27;s very inexpensive to make billions of guesses per second against a hash like that. They&#x27;ll go through a list of the top 10 million most common passwords, then start iterating through lists of combinations of common dictionary words. Most password cracking software is very smart and will try all kinds of substitutions.<p>Assume that &quot;Forgive&quot; and &quot;her&quot; are in a dictionary of the 2000 most common words. Trying all 2-word combinations would be 2000^2 = 4 million guesses. They try with and without a special character (including a space) between them - assuming say 15 different characters, that&#x27;s 60 million guesses. Try it with the first letter capitalized and uncapitalized, then also try each word alternately in all-caps (multiply by 5) 300 million guesses. Let&#x27;s assume that each word, using common &quot;1337&quot; substitutions, has an average of 10 alternate forms - that&#x27;s 3 billion guesses to cover the entire space of the 2000 most common words with all kinds of variations. On average your password will be about halfway through the list, so say 1.5 billion guesses to get there. If you used a $50 GPU, this would take maybe 10-20 seconds to complete. If you used ASICs designed for mining bitcoin, it would take much, much less than a second.<p>Of course, the attackers might try other strategies. If they used a pure brute force, they&#x27;d never get to Forgive@her, but password cracking has gotten a lot smarter than that. You&#x27;re basically taking a risk that this strategy (which is actually a subset of a more commonly used strategy) is not known by the hackers, because if it is, you&#x27;ll be cracked very, very quickly.<p>Best practice in password strategies is to assume that the hacker knows your <i>exact</i> strategy and calculate the entropy of the password. The best &quot;bang for your buck&quot; is fully random, random-case passwords with all special characters possible. Assuming a 96 character set, a 12-character password like that has about 10^23 combinations, so even making 100 trillion guesses per second would take 200 years. If you want to use words, effectively case insensitive, you&#x27;ll probably need more characters (but fewer words) - a password of equivalent security drawn from a pool of 10,000 words would be 6 words long. You can obviously use a mix of strategies to get the balance you&#x27;d prefer.",1405015991

I run Kivo (www.kivo.com YC S13) we&#x27;re trying to address a lot of the same problems around sharing and storage that Dropbox et al have missed out on. Zocalo seems like a really good first pass, but I don&#x27;t think tying users to a specific storage platform is the winning strategy for something that&#x27;s fundamentally a collaboration app. It shouldn&#x27;t matter where someone stores their files, collaboration applications should exist as layers on top of existing content. Forcing users to move to a new platform is one more point of friction when it comes to adoption. Storage companies releasing collaboration products is like email providers only letting their users email other users of their service - Gmail to Gmail email product. The reason why email works as a communication protocol is because it is an open one. Content collaboration is the same, the company that will win this market will be the one that addresses it without letting the politics of the &#x27;storage wars&#x27; poison its simplicity. The &#x27;it just works&#x27; of Dropbox comes from its ability to store and sync any file without any change in user behaviour - it&#x27;s just another folder. No one&#x27;s created an &#x27;it just works&#x27; product for collaboration yet, where it doesn&#x27;t matter whereabouts your files are stored or who it is that you want to work with. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to do at Kivo, and we&#x27;ll be announcing a set of integrations very soon to make that so.

Post-scarcity postmodern Keynesianism?<p>I did not think of that, mainly because it does not make sense in the management economy that rules this fictional world. Ideally it would be completely self-sustaining and would likely continue on until an extinction event, however there is a &quot;management debt&quot; accrued as the result of business and government inefficiency and abstraction (see failed government-contractor negotiations). If left unchecked it would result in collapse of such a system because everything would become horribly fubar. Thus, to prevent the collapse of their system, the ruling class in interest of its own survival could indirectly (AI) or directly &quot;pay off&quot; the management debt by investing or creating (and importing selected individuals from the non-ruling class) ventures that fix the dilapidated systems or provided exploratory break through (space travel). This raises some from the non-ruling class to the ruling class in the process, of course, but is of little impact. Additionally, potato salad ventures could be used in a lottery system to provide hope to the non-ruling class, or completely replace the previous method of management debt checking, allowing the system to operate for much longer than it normally would... until it suddenly collapses under the insane amounts of inefficiency it introduces.<p>(Interestingly, this explains large corporate behaviour.)<p>> I could see Martian colonization and other difficult endeavours being undertaken by those who see this existence as empty and pointless and who actively desire a real challenge... possibly led and capitalized by factions of the ruling class who share this sentiment.<p>Every good story needs rebellious outcasts and non-ironic hope for humanity. A <i>musky</i> settlement on Mars like you describe is just perfect. :)<p>> Wait... are we even talking about fiction here?!? :)<p>The more of the world I experience, either through my own eyes or vicariously through the wisdom of others, leads me to closer to the conclusion that no, in fact we are writing humanity&#x27;s (short?) biography.<p>> If on the other hand problems like fossil fuel depletion cause us to fail to reach anything like post-scarcity, I could see a scenario very much like William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer. I think Gibson&#x27;s &quot;sprawl&quot; &#x27;verse is a world where the singularity failed to reach orbit so to speak. Going even more extreme I could see The Hunger Games -- tiny ultra-urban enclaves of super-rich surrounded by and served by feudal peasants. The Hunger Games (as opposed to Mad Max) is probably the most accurate picture of what a worst case scenario peak oil collapse would look like.<p>I think we may see <i>both</i> scenarios, and a revival of the <i>us versus them</i> mentality that dominated the Cold War. :(",1405015406

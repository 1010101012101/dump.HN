If one waits until the price comes down, multiplayer usually goes in a few directions detracting from it&#x27;s enjoyment. one, the vast majority of players may have moved on and it&#x27;s a ghost town. two, everyone is high level and it&#x27;s hard to find games with other players until you level up enough and leveling up without other players is a grind. Last, it&#x27;s a skill based game and the majority of players are good and know the levels/races/whatever and you must suffer through many, many losses until your skills and knowledge gets up to speed.",1401494334

Laptop batteries are great because they come with a laptop that can charge them very quickly.<p>A car battery gives you the option to use many other routers (maybe you have a suitable one lying around!). Routers often use a 12 Volt DC input, and although a direct connection between the battery and the device is theoretically the wrong voltage, in practice I myself would just connect it straight through without any qualms (unless it was an expensive or rare router!). The WR703N probably uses less power so would run longer, but maybe compromises on range?!",1401493778

At the time, Ada had a reputation as &quot;that over-bloated language that people in the defense department have to use.&quot;  This perhaps underserved reputation is addressed in section 7 of the linked article.<p>From my point of view at the time, any language that the US Government would mandate as a required technology MUST be flawed.  A language embraced by a large bureaucracy must be full of large bureaucratic nonsense.  That was the thinking, at any rate.  Ada, along with Cobol, was a frequent target of snarky jokes.  In the mid-80s, the cool kids were programming in C (while being paid to program in Basic or Cobol or Fortran).<p>I freely admit these notions were likely borne out of ignorance, but I imagine this reputation stifled its adaptation outside of government circles.

So Google&#x27;s willingness to invest in fiber while committing to net neutrality doesn&#x27;t refute my point about what would happen if the FCC imposed Title II. Also, its too early to draw conclusions from Google fiber. Google&#x27;s stated purpose is to use Google Fiber to &quot;shame&quot; ISP&#x27;s into offering faster service, which benefits their advertising-related business units. I don&#x27;t think you can conclude that a company in Google&#x27;s position, but without the internet business, would find fiber investment attractive. Finally, Google doesn&#x27;t seem very eager to deploy fiber into the biggest markets, and in the markets where they have deployed, they have demanded extensive regulatory concessions.<p>The FCC would love to apply something lighter than Title II, like the &quot;light touch&quot; regime they have applied to cellular.

However, to preserve the initial user experience you could allow the first 5 IP addresses to access the tunnel of unvalidated accounts. This should let them experience the full benefits themselves and/or with their friends or a few remote services and can keep using it with only those first 5 IP addresses. Afterwards, they can jump through extra hoops to remove restrictions. For example:<p><pre><code>  * Free plan: keep using it with up to 5 IP addresses. Rate\n    limited to 512 Kbps total.\n  * Lite plan: register by having us send you an SMS. Unlocks up\n    to 10 different subnets (allows the entire /24 or /16 etc.\n    network block based on whois lookup).\n  * Home plan: pay us $X and remove all IP restrictions. Up to 5\n    simultaneous connections at 512 Kbps per connection.\n  * Professional plan: pay us $Y and remove all IP restrictions.\n    Up to 15 simultaneous open connections at 1.5 Mbps each.\n  * Enterprise plan: need something custom? We&#x27;re happy to put\n    together a quote.\n</code></pre>\nThis limits your exposure to abuse to the first 5 visitors without degrading the experience. Once that threshold is hit, you can response with a &quot;429 Too Many Requests&quot; type of server response, with a link to more info. You could also let users expire IP addresses/subnets, freeing up new connections from new IPs (with appropriate rate limiting).

7824654,comment,7824378,7824598,2,0,cbsmith,,,"> Deis was architected before the CoreOS integration.<p>Okay this makes sense. If I were in your shoes, I might be tempted to radically reexamine the architecture in light of CoreOS&#x27;s design. Otherwise you end up duplicating work or working at cross purposes, and CoreOS&#x27;s components (systemd, etcd, fleet, etc.) are pretty cleanly separable from both CoreOS and each other already, so you shouldn&#x27;t end up being married to CoreOS should there be some kind of problem.<p>Given that you&#x27;re maintaining a level of agnosticism, what do you see as the main thing you are gaining by integrating CoreOS?<p>> We view platform logging as separate from application-level logging.<p>One can certainly take that view, but I&#x27;d argue it does lead to more complexity for managing logging.<p>> Aggregating logs through the systemd journal is possible, but it would tie us a little too closely to systemd. Using log sidekick containers (as we do) is more portable and easier to funnel to end developers.<p>Fair enough, but if you really want to be agnostic, I&#x27;d say have the contract that in the end <i>everything</i> goes in to a syslogd of some kind, but have the <i>default</i> approach to getting that job done be via systemd (with /run/systemd/journal/syslog to get it the rest of the way). If someone wants to use rsyslog or something else to do the job, so be it.<p>While using the log sidekick approach is popular, it&#x27;s actually quite inefficient and clumsy. Particularly on magnetic disk, you&#x27;ve got this nice, efficient, append only per-event log writing that doesn&#x27;t even have to be cached and then you periodically scrape through the old stuff as if it were just a blob of bytes.<p>The big win though is that you no longer need a sidekick for managing logging from each container. No muss no fuss about where the logs are, etc. Instead you just direct logging to systemd (or if need be, the syslogd socket). No sidekick required!",1401493108

7824576,comment,7821854,7822975,1,0,sliverstorm,,,"<i>So like I said, what we really need is a common open ISA for hardware graphics accelerators to implement, and then independently develop extensions for that can be proposed and adopted into the mainstream standard.</i><p>Except for the word &quot;ISA&quot;, this sounds an awful lot like OpenGL, OpenCL, & Direct3D.<p>Which makes sense. You don&#x27;t run a software binary on a GPU, so why does it need its own standard ISA? A GPU crunches data. The CPU feeds the GPU data. So we use APIs. You could make the GPU more like a CPU at the cost of graphics performance. Or you could integrate a CPU to the GPU, whose job is to run software and keep the GPU fed. But that sounds an awful lot like an APU.<p>Basically what I&#x27;m saying is a GPU is more like a network adapter- it is just fed data- and network adapters don&#x27;t have their own ISA either! They do have binary blobs, but that is firmware.",1401491295

And may well end up exposing more about your security configuration than you had intended.<p>Follow what the article suggests here... <i>What steps can you take to reduce the probability of an attack being successful?</i><p>Going backwards to where a server configuration might be defensible and debuggable and recoverable.  Look to a move to certificate-based authentication (or passphrases and certificates) and away from traditional passwords, to VPNs rather than open protocols, to sftp and away from ftp, to locked-down web and service directories for services rather than writable directories, to various options with firewall blocks or zen-based or other blacklists combined with tools such as mod_security, to staying current on your software versions, to configuring defenses in depth against common attacks, and to getting your logs where you want it, and the one that tends to get lost...<p>You want...  <i>Good backups of your data.</i><p>And preferably with some of these backup copies entirely disconnected from the security domain of your server.

I found that as I was learning more about design, my outlook about art in general started to change, which in turn started to affect my photography (i.e. my content). Design is a very subtle thing. It is a mistake to think about design as ""making things pretty."" Design is communication. Everything you do reveals something about yourself. Design is about taking control of what the choices you make reveal about yourself.<p>A lot of engineers I know have the attitude (it's almost a cliche to say it) that ""design is unnecessary; things don't have to be pretty."" They say that because they have never experienced <i>great</i> design or have never had a chance to work with <i>great</i> designers. Great designers do not make things pretty; making things pretty for its own sake is frowned upon in the design community. This is not the 19th century when design amounted to putting in as much ornament as you could fit. The best 20th century design was closer to ""information design"" than to decoration.<p>Some of the greatest designers of the 20th century were also engineers and architects. Charles Eames was an expert in structural engineering and materials science, which gave him a distinctive edge (Charles and Ray introduced many new materials such as plywood, fiberglass into their furniture designs). Muller Brockmann (inventor of the ""grid"") was extremely precise (as well as concise) with his poster layouts -- as precise as any engineer is with the blueprints.<p>A related tendency some engineers have is that they dismiss the expertise of people who went to a design school or an art school. They assume (incorrectly) that whatever they themselves ""like"" will also be liked by other people. In this regard, I blame engineers more than I blame designers. Designers (at least all the good ones) understand that engineering is a complex domain and that they have to listen to the words of people who have studied it and/or are doing it professionally. Engineers, on the other hand, have this tendency to look down on art and design as ""soft"" subjects, to view them as unnecessary, and they tend to be dismissive of people who studied it. This attitude is self-defeating, however, since it only contributes to the proliferation of bad designs, which in turn gives the advantage to good designs because they start to be seen as ""rare"" and distinctive.",1294069092

If some piece of information is valuable to somebody, they'll tend to want to pay to get it, and they certainly won't want to be denied it simply because its publisher didn't pay a middleman enough. By contrast, if an advertiser is paying a middleman money to shove their advertising in your face, it suggests that you seeing that information has positive value to the advertiser and <i>negative</i> value to you.  In the long run, advertising tends to get trapped in an arms race between ever-more-aggressive advertisers and ever-more-jaded advertisees with mute buttons, fast-forward, and AdBlock Plus.<p>Of course, in real life, we don't live in a perfectly efficient market. There's lots of friction. There are probably any number of mutually beneficial commercial transactions I would like to engage in <i>right now</i> but can't because I don't know about the possibility, and advertisers paying middlemen to tell me about them is a Pareto improvement.

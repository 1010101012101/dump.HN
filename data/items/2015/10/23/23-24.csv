So we can all get together and say, &quot;oh boy, I really relate to that&quot;? There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any insight or useful takeaway from this article besides being relatable for a certain class of people who feel misunderstood.<p>Most of the things in this article that the author describes as being harrowing cognitive loads, like how long to make eye contact for or hold a handshake, are things that I have heard very socially skilled people talk about in a humorous manner. They have those same reservations and insecurities, the difference is they don&#x27;t obsess about them. Look around. There is no such thing as &quot;a normal amount of eye contact&quot;. Everyone is just winging it.",1445644798

Forget you exist. Focus your thoughts entirely outwards. Don&#x27;t worry about playing &quot;hot potato&quot; with the conversation; let yourself become a black box with no inputs back into that anxious, tumultous part of your brain that has to analyze every little detail of every social encounter. Allow the conversation to happen outside your head.<p>For me, once I figured this out, all that stuff about body language, social time, and not feeling &quot;weird&quot; just naturally fell into place. These behaviors were mostly functions of a mind trying to micromanage every single little thing. I&#x27;m still very bad at actually getting into social situations, but when I somehow end up in one, it&#x27;s almost always OK.<p>I think this is why alcohol helps. When you&#x27;re inebriated, you simply don&#x27;t have the concentration to reflect every thought back inwards.",1445644742

We are taxed on what we earn (multiple times even: State taxes, Federal taxes, FICA, and municipal income tax in some places). Then we are taxed on what we spend (sales tax). Sometimes the state gets to tax the same transaction twice or more; if I sell a car to another person, I pay income tax on what I get, and she must also pay title tax, which here in Georgia is 6.5% of the value of the car. If I buy a car from a dealership, I pay sales tax as well as title tax.<p>Pretty much all tax systems are double-dipping, corrupt cesspools. But what&#x27;s the alternative?",1445643425

Mastering and extending a body of knowledge doesn&#x27;t have to come from independently postulating a few principles and working things out from there (though that can be very fun and satisfying). Focus first on imitation, memorization, then figure out how to apply it. After you can apply it, figure out how to adapt it in certain circumstances. You might even evolve and extend the knowledge, especially as you integrate other things.<p>One hack I&#x27;d suggest for fulfilling the craving of doing things &quot;from scratch&quot; when you&#x27;re frustrated at a particular problem is to go back to one you already solved, but pick some class or method or set of methods of Java&#x27;s library you used and make your own version. New problem! Data structures can be the most common. Used a java.util.Stack object? Write your own Stack class. Instead of `int Integer.parseInt(String);`, write your own. Try a hash map when you&#x27;re a little more experienced. Pretty much everyone with the hunger writes their own string class eventually (usually in C++). Or try to solve the whole problem again in a language that gives you less, like C. It&#x27;s good practice for college and tech interviews too. Too boring? Waste of time? Good, you&#x27;ll appreciate it&#x27;s there next time so that you don&#x27;t have to keep reinventing the wheel and can just use it as you go about inventing some new thing made of wheels. The only danger is if your appetite is totally consumed, you&#x27;ll swing the other way always searching and waiting for the right set of already-built dependencies you just have to glue together, and even then you could just hope for a framework that does that, your tolerance for exerting any programming effort for &#x27;boring&#x27; stuff will go away, and everything will be &#x27;boring&#x27;.

The problem as I see it is companies are trying to hire coders when they really want Software Engineers. Or maybe I should say they are trying to buy a Software engineer but only willing to pay the coder rate.<p>A good Software engineer can design a program or system and not even have to know the programming language, they understand software and how it should work. I have on many occasions told our SQL coders/programmers where problems are and how to fix them without ever having programmed in SQL.<p>The key is the Software Engineer understands the fundamentals of the system as an engineer and understand how everything goes together and should work. For example, if you are designing a business system, you engineers understand how the business works and how the program can help it. The coders know how to implement the design but not the why&#x27;s.<p>If you are hiring outside vendors then it is even worse. They are coders that know nothing about your business or your project or what you are trying to do but they do know how to code something, let you try it, have you change it and try it again and change it again and try it again an...you get the picture. If you hire a software engineer that understands software and learns your business, they can develop design documents that can then direct your vendor. This creates a better product the first time and at a lower cost.<p>The schools today are creating more and more programmers and fewer Software Engineers.",1445641562

Unless things have changed a lot in the last couple of years, medical practices are allowed to and generally do charge a non-trivial copying fee for providing records to patients; these fees have legally set base cost and per-page caps that I believe are updated yearly.<p>I&#x27;m sure some of this has changed as offices shifted to EMR (Electronic Medical Records) systems, but many offices don&#x27;t scan the entire existing chart into a new system - just the key parts relevant to current care (e.g. labs from the last 6-12 months, etc.). The full chart is still in a tagged manila folder on a shelf or in a box depending on the office.<p>I&#x27;ve not regularly seen practices charge for sending records to other medical practices or for providing limited information to the patient directly (e.g. copies of labs), but that&#x27;s usually not for an entire chart it&#x27;s for items that can reasonably be faxed. Where I have seen practices charge it&#x27;s when they also have a regularly scheduled outside service that comes in to scan entire charts that have been requested and for some specialties (e.g. neurology) those charts can easily be 500-1000 pages. I suspect that if a patient wants an entire chart transferred to a new practice that the old one will require that they request and pay for the copy, then it&#x27;s the patient&#x27;s job to get it to the new folks.<p>Changing systems can also be a problem; I know of one specialty practice that has a firewalled-off 2003 server with their old EMR on it because when they migrated to a new system only demographics and some other basic information could be automatically imported. When previous patients schedule appointments, they go into the old system and export all the relevant records to PDFs, then import those into the patient&#x27;s chart in the new system.<p>Given the still-widespread need to either scan a bunch of paper, retrieve records from multiple systems, and pay for printing or burning to a CD I see no reasonable way for a company to offer that service free or even inexpensively.<p>Update: here&#x27;s a nice resource on per-state costs: <a href=""http://www.lamblawoffice.com/medical-records-copying-charges.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lamblawoffice.com/medical-records-copying-charges...</a><p>In Illinois, for example, it can legally cost you a minimum of $25 even for a single page, though as I noted most offices don&#x27;t seem to have a problem with not charging for small numbers of pages.",1445641495

If I'm editing a presentation, switch windows, and go to the presentation list, if I choose one and click edit, the working presentation is automatically saved (gasp) and the editor does not come into focus either (although that might be KDE's focus stealing prevention at work).<p>",1190253299
57165,comment,57094,57144,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"You're absolutely right, in some aspects. Some things will always be better done locally; it's ridiculous to contemplate writing a 3d game without access to a 3d API, for example. And it's silly to have a ton of cheap processing power sat under your desk pretending to be a 3270.<p>So I wonder if the future is going to be client-server at all? Perhaps the arrangement will be that in exchange for using the services of webapp X, you contribute your processor to act as part of the distributed processing for the backend part of that webapp. Your request might end up being processed on your machine, or it might be processed three thousand miles away whilst your machine is processing someone else's request... If peer-to-peer file transfer applications (or, you know, natural history) have taught us anything, it's the value of distributed, decentralised, cellular systems. The webapps we're seeing right now are incredibly primitive, and have barely scratched the surface of such things - but when they do, when people start talking JSON or AJAX or some other ETLA to each other's <i>browsers</i> rather than to centralised servers, when the only difference between a web browser and a web server is that the browser has the GUI loaded - then we'll really see the value of webapps...<p>...hmm. Excuse me, I may be a little busy for a while...",1190253260

57152,comment,57094,57118,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"> the really intensive javascript apps just use way too much memory in Firefox, especially when you have 12 hour Firefox sessions<p>I suspect that huge improvements in the state of Javascript interpreters will really start to change the equations. If JS is Lisp in disguise, there's no reason why JS engines can't start to benefit from the decades of evolution put into Common Lisp runtimes.<p>Come to think of it, what if a JS engine got fast enough that the browser itself could be written in Javascript?",1190251668

Are you going to ask me to run a non-linear optimization routine written in <i>JavaScript?!</i><p>You expect me to accept circa-1994 graphics in games? You expect me to pay for that?<p>What kind of dreamworld are you living in?<p>Google Spreadsheets hemmorages, huffs and puffs if you have more than several dozen rows - it robs power users of most of their keyboard shortcuts and has no kind of extensibility at all. It uses up dozens of MB of RAM with a blank sheet. It's a real Excel killer alright. Which is amazing because Excel has only seen minor, incremental improvements in the last <i>decade.</i><p>You're telling me quasi-3D games I played in 1994 on a machine 300x slower than the one I'm using right now constitutes approaching parity with local native code?<p>In several years, a language like JavaScript will run on the machines available then the way C++ runs on today's machines. But when that happens, machines with many cores will be ubiquitous, and the ridiculous lag will still be present - would you like to run your embarassingly parallel program with 1 core or 32? (1 of course, it's online! Wowzers!)",1190250453

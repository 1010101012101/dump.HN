3566752,comment,3566419,3566419,6,0,krschultz,,,"I'm a big proponent of autonomous cars (did a lot of work on it in college, follow it closely now). I don't think all cars need to be autonomous, but I think overall it will make the roads a lot safer once the thing is worked out. The car will never get sleepy. It will never get drunk. It will never be talking on a cell phone. It will never be road raging.<p>The road block I see the most is the weather. In my experience designing cars, the cameras are falliable but the lasers are not. We trusted the lasers absolutely but the cameras were a lot less certain. That's fine for object avoidance on dry roads (or even wet roads with consistent slip), but on snow you really want to be driving based on the road surface itself. Is it loose snow? Ice? Packed snow? Slush? Is there a hump of slush between lanes? Is that a pothole or a bit of black ice? Can I get some pavement under me or not? I find it hard to believe that a camera will be able to distinguish all that perfectly (texture, snow depth, snow type, etc). I think they will punt and make the car just drive 15mph, but that is unacceptable for me. I have AWD & snow tires and routinely do 45-50 mph in snow. But there are other times in the exact same car that anything over 20 is unsafe. It is entirely dependent on the judgement of the snow surface that I don't think a computer will be able to do for a long time.<p>That's just my nit pick, but it is part of the larger problem. It is going to be super difficult to convince people to actually allow it. Most people are afraid of computers and don't trust them.",1328713194

It is <i>always</i> the student who learns and in that sense, everyone is an ""autodidact"". This is not to belittle a teacher who's role in directing a student, keeping her on her toes, challenging, questioning, probing, explaining, etc. which are all valuable. The thing is, a formal teacher is not the only source of those things. Our parents and peers do those things too.<p>You learn, you get good at something ... anything. In today's world, feedback from the community on what you need to get good at and whether you're getting good at it seems adequate to the point that if you know how to make use of that, you can learn stuff efficiently and effectively. You might say more of us are becoming ""allodidacts"".<p>The third point is teachers also continuously learn. Peer learning is how scientific progress happens, for instance.

If you had ""raw feeds of actual video, with absolutely minimal editing,"" I think you'll find yourself overwhelmed with information.<p>The job of the newspaper editor is to condense the material down, and like you say, correlate and aggregate it to form a narrative that is easier to consume.  Sure, I'll concede that the majority of news editors choose to showcase worthless information -- particularly on television -- but you have to understand that it's a capitalist economic model and the newspapers are only delivering what the consumer wants.<p>""1st generation"" reporting to me means a journalist who goes out and gets the interviews and video feeds.  Do you think there were <i>pre-existing</i> ""raw video feeds"" out there for the Enron executives, the survivors of the Japan earthquake, etc.?  ""1st generation"" reporting comprises the effort it takes a good journalist to identify which parts of the story need telling and going out and getting them.  Yes, there is inevitable bias -- but we have to be able to take it with a grain of salt and make up our own mind based on potentially multiple narratives of the same story.<p>(Also, just to touch on this... I think you're underestimating the value of the news agencies.  They provide resources to make quality reporting a viable economic model.  In addition, they provide a name behind which the journalists' sources can trust.  Would 'Deep Throat' have divulged his knowledge to Bernstein and Woodward if they had not been reporting for the Washington Post?  Obviously, we'll never know the answer to that question, but I personally believe it's an important consideration for any potential source.)",1328712826

He gave a gave a lecture & led a discussion on the Challenger O-Ring case (and I have since read a lot of the reports). As you mentioned, the CMU lecturer wasn't even close to the real story. But it also ins't so simple as to say 'managment didn't listen'.<p>The engineers knew what was going to happen with a fairly high degree of certainty - enough that the launch shouldn't hvae happened. Then they turned to management and tried to present their findings. Clearly the business guys didn't want to be the ones to hold up the launch, they had a strong incentive not to. So the engineers <i>had</i> to convince them why the company should basically stick its neck out as one of hundreds and hundreds of vendors and stop this launch. The engineers didn't do the best job of communicating the certainty of the problem, the magnitude of the problem, etc. So it was a little bit of both.<p>That lecture was probably 8 years ago for me, but it definitely left a lasting impression.

On July 22, 1985, Roger Boisjoly of the structures section wrote a memorandum predicting NASA might give the motor contract to a competitor or there might be a flight failure if Thiokol did not come up with a timely solution.<p>Nine days later (July 31) Boisjoly wrote another memorandum titled ""O-ring Erosion/Potential Failure Criticality"" to R. K. Lund, Thiokol's Vice President of Engineering:<p><i>""The mistakenly accepted position on the joint problem was to fly without fear of failure and to run a series of design evaluations which would ultimately lead to a solution or at least a significant reduction of the erosion problem. This position is now changed as a result of the [51-B] nozzle joint erosion which eroded a secondary O-ring with the primary O-ring never sealing. If the same scenario should occur in a field joint (and it could), then it is a jump ball whether as to the success or failure of the joint because the secondary O-ring cannot respond to the clevis opening rate and may not be capable of pressurization. The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order-loss of human life.""</i><p>Boisjoly recommended setting up a team to solve the O-ring problem, and concluded by stating:<p><i>""It is my honest and very real fear that if we do not take immediate action to dedicate a team to solve the problem, with the field joint having the number one priority, then we stand in jeopardy of losing a flight along with all the launch pad facilities.""</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm</a>",1328710243

3566533,comment,3564987,3565598,2,0,dmbaggett,,,"Maybe feeding the troll, but in case you were serious...<p>My point was that the author is forced to use some arbitrary standard like ""publicly traded"" since such a proposal is inherently unworkable for illiquid investments. But in doing so, the author creates an obvious problem: if ""publicly traded"" is the litmus test for this new mark-to-market tax, then investors will move investments into non-public vehicles to avoid paying the tax.<p>As to your second point, the amount of publicly traded float is not zero sum: companies regularly go public and take themselves private to achieve financial, governance, and other objectives. So it is not the case that anyone necessarily would be paying the mark-to-market tax on shares of a currently publicly traded company, any more than it is the case that having an X% corporate tax rate means US companies pay X% of profits in tax to the US government.<p>If this proposal were enacted, future-incredibly-valuable company F woud avoid becoming a publicly traded company entirely. Facebook, which the author cites because it's headline-grabbing, harms rather than helps his case: they've intentionally avoided going public until now, and could into the arbitrary future if it were especially onerous for the founders/investors for the company to do so. The rational expectation of Facebook principals right now is that the benefits of going public (at least for the founders and investors) outweigh the negatives, because there is a massive liquidity and valuation improvement from doing so.<p>But under the author's proposal, that cost/benefit analysis would change, and companies would simply stay private and achieve liquidity for founders and investors via other mechanisms. Over time, these mechanisms would evolve into processes that were as close to indistinguishable from public company registration as possible without actually triggering the language of the market-to-market tax law. SEC rules about selling shares to non-qualified investors would still hold, obviously, but I'm sure with so much potential tax to be saved, investors would find ways to legally aggregate non-qualified investors into qualified vehicles to get around this. Or just live with qualified investors, and no others, owning their companies.",1328709765

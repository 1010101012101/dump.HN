The best solution for a subset of programmers is unlikely to be the best solution for every programmer. Somewhat like the quote about literate programming:<p>&quot;Jon Bentley probably hit the nail on the head when he once was asked why literate programming hasn’t taken the whole world by storm. He observed that a small percentage of the world’s population is good at programming, and a small percentage is good at writing; apparently I am asking everybody to be in both subsets.&quot;\n -- According to Donald Knuth\n <a href=""http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856</a><p>While I think there is much more overlap between good programmers that write good Forth, those that write good Ada (or other procedural code), those that write good functional programs, those that bask in the glory of Smalltalk/Self (classic oo) and those that get by in java (&quot;modern&quot;/class-oriented oo) -- than between good technical writers and good programmers -- I think the problem is partly the same.<p>There&#x27;s no guarantee that haskell is the best tool for a 10 year old write interactive fiction, or automate his or her schedule -- and for a finance manager to manage numbers and for an engineer to write code for a robot -- or for high frequency trading... or etc.<p>Machines don&#x27;t understand Haskell anyway, only humans do. If many of us find Visual Basic or Excel or SQL easier... we probably have a need for such languages (even if <i>I</i> don&#x27;t want to touch Visual Basic with a stick...).<p>Multiple programming paradigms has nothing to do with computers and systems, and everything to do with human-machine interface and augmenting the capabilities of humans through computers.",1429361529

9399252,comment,9397974,9398949,0,0,vanderZwan,,,"> Harmonising VAT on physical goods will probably never happen<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that too quickly. People tend to paint the EU as some bureaucratic behemoth, but the whole point of the project was to <i>vastly</i> reduce administrative overhead for deploying to EU markets, and it has done so quite successfully. Compare &quot;meet EU standards and it can be sold everywhere in the EU&quot; to &quot;have to double check the standards for every country we want to deploy to&quot; - it&#x27;s pretty obvious why the former is easier to deal with.<p>In fact, one of the biggest problems it is currently facing is that it&#x27;s running out of things to fix in that sense. When it was about standardizing, I don&#x27;t know, legally allowed substances in perfume, the benefits of standardisation far outweighed the hassle of changing local regulation. Now that its doing all kinds of things that can&#x27;t be summarized as <i>&quot;everyone will (begrudgingly) go along because even in the worst case it benefits every involved nation&quot;</i>, it&#x27;s much harder to reach a consensus this way (paraphrasing a few books on the EU from memory).<p>Anyway, standardised VAT rules could fall under the old &quot;benefits everyone&quot;-category of projects, even for non-digital goods, so who knows?",1429361228

Which is not what you want for an interpreter that has many, many code paths and is supposed to run a wide variety of code.<p>You won&#x27;t get a 30% FDO speedup in any practical scenario. It does little for most other benchmarks and it&#x27;ll pessimize quite a few of them, for sure.<p>Ok, so feed it with a huge mix of benchmarks that simulate typical usage. But then the profile gets flatter and FDO becomes much less effective.<p>Anyway, my point still stands: a factor of 1.1x - 1.3x is doable. Fine. But we&#x27;re talking about a 3x speedup for my hand-written machine vs. what the C compiler produces. And that&#x27;s only a comparatively tiny speedup you get from applying domain-specific knowledge. Just ask the people writing video codecs about their opinion on C vector intrinsics sometime.<p>I write machine code, so you don&#x27;t have to. The fact that I have to do it at all is disappointing. Especially from my perspective as a compiler writer.<p>But DJB is of course right: the key problem is not the compiler. We don&#x27;t have a source language that&#x27;s at the right level to express our domain-specific knowledge while leaving the implementation details to the compiler (or the hardware).<p>And I&#x27;d like to add: we probably don&#x27;t have the CPU architectures that would fit that hypothetical language.<p>See my ramblings about preserving programmer intent, I made in the past: <a href=""http://www.freelists.org/post/luajit/Ramblings-on-languages-and-architectures-was-Re-any-benefit-to-throwing-off-lua51-constraints"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freelists.org/post/luajit/Ramblings-on-languages-...</a>",1429360293

Where fighting back can clear things up and long term you may start a friendship with some of those bullies.<p>Also, even if you lose making fights more costly / painful is a significant disincentive.<p>PS: There are also pure sociopaths out there and not everyone can put up a good fight etc.  But, in plenty of situations violence is not really vicious and can calm things down.",1429360026

The below is just my opinion...)<p>#1: The usual approach is something like remove app servers from the load balancers&#x27; rotation, upgrade them, run some sort of tests to ensure the upgrade is ok, add them back into the LB rotation.  Some environments might use user traffic as the test step (e.g. send 5% of your users at the newly upgraded machines, watch monitoring to see how response times and error counts behave).<p>#2: The answer here really depends on what scale you&#x27;re operating at. DB replication (e.g. read slaves if your traffic is more read-heavy that write heavy) and sufficiently high-spec machines combined with intelligent use of caching can take you a fairly long way.  I hesitate to give hard numbers, but off the cuff probably 99% of sites will never need more than this.  There&#x27;s not really a recipe to follow for that, the data needs and design/ops parameters of an organization tend to be fairly specific to that org; more or less it&#x27;s good schema design, thinking hard about how fresh data has to be at the edge, caching what you can with careful management of expiry times, and having an ops team comfortable with managing replication.  Beyond that scale you start getting into globe-spanning multiple-datacenter voodoo rocket science. :)  Ask amazon, google or facebook (some of their work has been mentioned publicly, things like cassandra from fb and various papers published by google/amazon).",1429359848

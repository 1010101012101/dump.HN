Says she feels in more control without it, and that it gave her a false sense of ""security.""  And she has had better results since, and more stable sugars.<p>I don't know, obviously, not being diabetic myself, but I will say she went on the pump really soon after being diagnosed and didn't really have a chance to establish a routine first, and that probably played a large part in her doing better on shots right now.  I've been encouraging her to start thinking about using the pump again, as I do feel that, used correctly, as I believe it is a better method, but she has to do what she feels works best for her.<p>Being a developer myself, the idea that she has to use a custom cable and custom software to manage the data she has in her meter drives me a bit nuts.  But the meter industry is, IMO, full of companies that don't really want to help users, they just want to get rich off of diabetics.  I know thats a bit cynical, and I'm sure there are companies that sincerely care as well, but it's how I often feel about the meter industry.",1339977137

4124222,comment,4124128,4124193,6,0,gruseom,,,"Whose work, especially in economics, isn't in ""some doubt""? A one paragraph blog post hardly discredits Krugman in general.<p>I am of no fixed opinion when it comes to economic theory, but Krugman's and Dean Baker's writings on the economy of the last ten years (i.e. housing bubble onwards) are some of the few things I've found that are intended for a general audience, are (at least partly) based on data rather than ideology alone, and seem coherent to me. That doesn't mean they're right, of course. If there's a critique of their view that meets the same criteria  generally accessible, based on evidence, not entirely ideological, and coherent  I'd like to see it. Most of what I've run across in that department is either incomprehensible to me, obviously ideological, or both.<p>The people who seem lacking in credibility right now are the ones recommending plunging ahead with full-bore austerity when there are both obvious reasons to think it will make matters worse (because it will reduce demand and slow growth) and obvious evidence that it is doing so right now, e.g. in the UK, which has been running this experiment for the last few years. Perhaps this is just my ignorance speaking, but what I noticed is: (1) those austerity measures were greeted by loud cheers by the same people who still think that way today; (2) the Krugman and Baker types predicted that it would make things worse; (3) the UK has gone back into recession.",1339977081

4124195,comment,4123097,4124020,3,0,scarmig,,,"I'm not sure we disagree.<p>I'd phrase my core logic as this. Historically, most really big things, great or terrible, have been done by centralized states. Central to state-building, though, is the concept of legibility: making information about the world understandable to the State and making it so that the State can efficiently use and act on that information to enact its will on the world. And technology--particularly telecommunications, including spoken language, counting, writing, roads, the printing press, arithmetic, ship building, radio, all the way up to computer programming--is all about legibility. Every advance in technology extends the State's power, and that continues today.<p>That's why Lenin could hop on a train in 1917 and drop straight into absolutist Russia without anyone in charge noticing. Then in the 1980s the apartheid government had the ability to effectively track the movements and contacts of dissidents and activists. And today the US federal government can call up a couple contacts and know everything about you, from how many times a week you get a coffee from the store at the corner to what you were thinking and searching for online on January 4, 2010, after lunch.<p>I'd agree that it was unrealistic for me to say we can direct how technology will end up being used. It's obviously true that you can't really direct it, nor can you really avoid it by ignoring it and hoping it goes away. What's now important for being proactive is building technology that will make human actions <i>less</i> legible and less subject to control by external forces.",1339976232

The existence of an account (even a shadow) means that your friends can inject data without your approval.  A tag in any picture, a mention by name at any kind of event or location, or even the existence of the friend link are all pieces of data that contribute towards profiling your behavior and determining advertisements that you might respond to.  This all occurs even if you yourself didn't provide any of it.  (Good luck telling your friends to never tag or mention you on Facebook.)<p>Facebook lets you think that you can delete or undo any of the above, but you still rely solely on Facebook's ethics as to whether they actually cease using the ""deleted"" data.  The only force that can restrict Facebook from keeping and using such data is legislation, and that and its implications would probably be a greater evil.",1339975701

If there were a particularly feminist or womanist Anonymous, women working together, what would they be doing? What or who would their targets be?

For what it's worth, this is what I would automatically install on any new Mac:<p>- iStat Menus: RAM, network and CPU usage right in your menu bar. Ridiculously useful.<p>- Video player: VLC<p>- FTP: CyberDuck. Desperately slow to launch and not a big fan of the UI but it's free, it works and I use FTP rarely enough to never have bothered looking for something better.<p>- gfxCardStatus - not necessarily a must-have but quite handy to see which app is causing your Mac to switch to the battery-sucking discrete GPU.<p>- Email: MailPlane (gmail / google apps only). I have to say that I've never found what I would consider to be a great email client for my taste on either Mac or Windows. So these days, I stick with Gmail's web interface (which I'm not a big fan of either but there's no native app that I find any better).<p>- Text Editor: TextWrangler. I still prefer Notepad++ though (in part because TextWrangler, like so many apps on Mac OS X, is so slow to launch).<p>- DaisyDisk - for later when you'll inevitably run out of disk space.<p>- Parallels Desktop for Windows + Remote Desktop Connection to manage Windows servers. I wish there was a better RDP client and a decent SSMS-like SQL Server client.<p>- Apps that used to be must-have but that I no longer use: HandBrake (DVD ripping), LiquidCD (CD / DVD burning), NetNewsWire (RSS)<p>That's about it. Random stuff that you might or might not need: Acorn (simple, cheap image editor), CoconutBattery, Hues (standalone color picker), iStumbler (Max OS X's NetStumbler), MacHg (Mercurial client). You can try Sparrow for email too.<p>That's it - have surprisingly few apps actually.",1339974383

I had onset at about 20, despite not looking like a typical diabetic (5-foot-8, 140lbs).  11-years ago, my endocrinologist made sure to drill into my head this margin of error, and that the margin of error was highest in situations where I would be hypoglycemic or suffering from an insulin reaction.  As a diabetic himself (and for the record, having a diabetic endocrinologist is the best thing you can hope for), he was all too aware and frustrated with the limitations.<p>Now, a few days ago it was pointed out that the margin of error for test strips in a medical facility is much lower.  The one thing I've been waiting for is to get that level of accuracy.  If there's one thing I want, it's that.  More than anything.  I couldn't give a rat's ass about anything else.<p>Getting that number consistent could've sped up the timeline in which it took to get my blood sugar levels to be consistent.  I'm not terribly methodical, but at the end of the day my endocrinologist doesn't complain when my HA1C results are consistently between 6.2 and 6.6, and have been for the past 6 years, despite relying only on subcutaneous injections(1) and continued dietary changes and experimentation.  However, I bet I could keep it at 6 on the nose -- while ""cheating"" a bit more -- if I knew that a reading was nearly dead-nuts on every time.<p>(1) Not a fan of pumps.

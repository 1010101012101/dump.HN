To help others, here&#x27;s a breakdown.<p>Notation: T[A,B]  : Translates from A to B<p>The OP wants to develop T[C, Go]. The question is which language should T[C,Go] be written in?<p>Option #1: If T[C,Go] is written in C, then it can use an existing C parsing library to parse C and then emit Go. Here parsing will be easier, but emitting Go will be laborious  to write in C (since C is very low level).<p>Option #2: If T[C,Go] is written in Go, then the parent claims that C parsing will have to be freshly developed in Go. This will be a pain but the Go emitting code will be easier to write in Go.<p>However, I think the problem with option #2 (parsing) can be avoided if one uses the parsing library that is assumed to be already available in C. Since Go can interface with C code[1], the parser need not be reinvented.<p>[1] : <a href=\"http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/</a>",1387425598

Now it&#x27;s depressing. I don&#x27;t have a solution yet to getting hired into today&#x27;s market where 6-figure income flow to kids performing skills it only took a few months to learn. Some ideas: (1) send your resume and practice interviewing with someone who will give you an honest respnose about why you&#x27;re not getting offers (real companies won&#x27;t give an honest response). (2) spend a couple of months putting up a free website on heroku with whatever are the &quot;hot&quot; products of the moment (arduino? raspbery? node? angular? go? mongo? zurb? etc...) then instead of a resume showing how old you are send a resume showing the stupid-but-well-paying stuff you can do with what&#x27;s hot at the moment. (2a) put it all on github and show HN (3) go to meetups where the people you want to work with are and talk to them, show something in the lightning talk, and say you&#x27;re looking for work. (4) go to hackers/founders things, buy beers, and say you&#x27;re technical.  (5) get tattoos, skinny jeans, and a skateboard, stop posting anything anonymously (nobody but old fogies believe in anonymity any more) and pretend you&#x27;re only 20.<p>If ANY of those work, please let me know so I can follow my own advise.<p>As for school, only go if what you want to do is to learn more and if you think that&#x27;s the way to learn.",1387425440

HDD is important (especially if you have an SSD) because it shows when it&#x27;s being accessed, Wifi is even <i>more</i> important because you&#x27;re communicating over the network when that one activates, and if it&#x27;s doing so without any reason to then you should suspect something going on (like malware infection). Ditto for BlueTooth. If they&#x27;re implemented well, hardware indicators are impossible to fake.<p>One of my biggest gripes is how MS removed in Win7 the little connection icon in the system tray that shows when data is sent/received (it even split send/recv into two separate indicators, rather clever I think.)

6932626,comment,6927485,6930759,3,0,saidajigumi,,,">  It&#x27;s a shame Git doesn&#x27;t have any tools to enforce that distinction.<p>Because, by design, Git can&#x27;t ever know.  Example one: a read-only repo can be fully cloned, meaning that all the branches therein should technically be &quot;public&quot;.  But the cloned repo is read-only so there&#x27;s no way to add metadata to its branches.  Example two: a developer &quot;publishes&quot; her entire repo to a wholly private offsite remote at the end of each day as a backup mechanism.  All branches should be marked &quot;public&quot;, but that would be wrong since they weren&#x27;t exposed to any other person.  I&#x27;ve recently worked in a shop where <i>all</i> <name>/<topic> branches in the main repo were considered logically private unless by prior agreement.  Publishing was defined as merging to master; rebasing a logically private branch was perfectly OK (and frequently mandatory).<p>More to the point: it&#x27;s not git&#x27;s job to be overly &quot;smart&quot;, especially in ways that require mind-reading.  git provides a powerful &quot;algebra of version control&quot;, where at some point even the &quot;porcelain&quot; commands can really be seen as &quot;plumbing&quot;.  In this light, I&#x27;m all in favor of higher levels of workflow porcelain.  In fact, many larger teams I&#x27;ve worked with accrete such a layer out of necessity.  Communicating and performing policy as folk knowledge eventually fails to scale, and tools pick up the slack. So the workflow you describe could be encoded as the Opinionated Policy of a tool on top of git which fills in the missing info in the scenarios above.<p>This reveals something I find disappointing about TFA: the lack of design exposition about its approach.  Also, it appears to be trying to address VCS design without actually talking at all about what&#x27;s known about the problem space to date.  IMO this stands in stark contrast to the current generation of DVCS tools where the players (git, hg, bzr, darcs, etc.) each communicated around a set of concrete lessons learned from prior VCS systems.",1387422316

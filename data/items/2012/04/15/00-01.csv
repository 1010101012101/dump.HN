It'd almost be analogous to writing an article titled ""In praise of Javascript"" and proceed to talk about jQuery functionality. jQuery has certainly had an impact on the Javascript language; but the two (despite popular opinion to the contrary) remain entirely distinct.",1334451519

3842407,comment,3841335,3841335,2,0,cd34,,,"Your site needs to have a strong benefit statement. I need to find out in two seconds whether it is worth me reading more. Your primary message needs to be well above the fold and needs to solve some pain point. Without that, any visits you get to your site are somewhat wasted.<p>Next, you need to think about how to get your target customers to visit the site. Who is your target market and where do they gather? Advertising on Facebook can be fairly well targeted so that you're not throwing away money advertising to people that aren't in your target market.<p>Finding people that are social 'kingpins' and getting them to become advocates is another method. Who are the bloggers that cover your space? Can they be contacted to tweet or blog about it? Can you develop a referral system or offer the app for free/reduced price in exchange for the referrals. Perhaps Klout.com can be used to identify some of your targets, or, technorati, etc.<p>J Conrad Levinson wrote some good books on Guerilla Marketing that talk about leveraging this, cross-promotions, etc.<p>Getting Press Releases accepted by the sites/magazines/periodicals that cover your market is another way. A well written Press Release directed to the right person can sometimes get you noticed.<p>Social buttons, Facebook Page, Twitter account - all generate buzz and make it very easy for someone to like/share the page. Include referral codes/bonuses so that your client become your best salespeople.<p>Your sales message needs to do two things. It needs to convey your Unique Selling Proposition (Rosser Reeves, from the 1960's) very quickly, and, tell me what pain you're going to remove. I need to have that 'aha' when I read your site that says, yes, I have experienced that, I hate that, this site solves that problem, let me try it out.<p>You also have to overcome the 'hot doorknob' syndrome. Someone passionate about the product has to get out there and knock on doors and recruit clients. Since you have the passion behind the project, when you're selling that to someone, that passion will infect them. People that see how excited you are about having solved their problem, will become advocates.<p>Network, network, network. You know people, they know people, surely someone that you know, knows someone that might use your product.<p>Get the product noticed. While writing X, we discovered Y was a problem with performance. We documented Z which fixed a problem with multithreaded quantum mechanics. Those stories bring readers, those readers look at what you're doing that caused you to discover that, they recommend what you're doing. Carsabi.com comes to mind regarding Solr - they solved a unique problem, documented that and I would bet probably got a lot of people to recognize their site from the blog post.<p>Almost any sales book will talk about what it tells to market. Service America is a pretty good book. Tom Hopkins, How to Master the Art of Selling. There are a few other good books, but, almost every sales book has the same message - solve someones pain.<p>Follow up. Both Twilio and Tropo do very well with this. Recently I had a situation I needed to fix, I set up demo accounts with both Twilio and Tropo. In five minutes, I had a simple script working with Twilio that took about 20 minutes with Tropo to get the same functionality. Tropo's documentation didn't make it extremely clear and I never did find a complete example without having to use urllib to get an auth key to talk with their service. However, that aside, both have sent follow up emails (automated I'm sure) that checked on progress, asked if I had questions, offered help and suggestions. While Tropo ultimately didn't do what I needed and I used Twilio for this quick project, Tropo's followup email mentioned a potential solution to another project I've been mulling over. Without that followup, I may not have reconsidered Tropo. And I knew about Tropo from superconf.net - they were a sponsor and I used their app to be SMS'ed a URL (ok, not a great use case), but, I did have prior exposure and I knew either could solve the first project.<p>Thirteen contacts with a person to make a sale and it costs more to get a new client, than to keep an existing client. Almost every sales book in the world will tell you this.<p>Simply. Build something awesome, spread the word, someone will pick up on it and it'll grow. The speed at which it grows is directly proportional to the number of people you pitch.<p>Some bookmarks referenced above:<p>Guerilla Marketing:\n  * <a href=""http://gmarketing.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gmarketing.com/</a><p>Landing Page Design\n  * <a href=""http://blog.kissmetrics.com/landing-page-design-infographic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.kissmetrics.com/landing-page-design-infographic/</a>\n  * <a href=""http://unbounce.com/101-landing-page-optimization-tips/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unbounce.com/101-landing-page-optimization-tips/</a>\n  * <a href=""http://bococreative.com/blog/30-tips-for-building-a-successful-landing-page/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bococreative.com/blog/30-tips-for-building-a-successf...</a>\n  * <a href=""http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/landing-page-optimization-tips-increases-sales-conversions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/landing...</a>\n  * <a href=""http://www.formstack.com/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-landing-page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.formstack.com/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-landing-pa...</a>",1334450865
3842406,story,,,1,1,Mikelots,"Amazon permanently closed my seller account, no warning, no questions.",,"After selling low-priced consumer electronics on Amazon for less than a month, Amazon shut down my Merchant Account on March 23, 2012.  Things started off great and I was excited about making Amazon a focal point of my business.  As I spent hours learning the Amazon interface and listing methods, my appreciation for the site grew.  My listings gradually grew in quantity and I was able to maintain 100% positive feedback with no customer complaints of any kind.<p>With plans to increase the listing count dramatically I turned on my computer one morning to find the following note from Amazon (emphasis mine):<p>Hello from Amazon.<p>We are writing to let you know that we have removed your selling privileges, canceled your listings, and placed a temporary hold on any funds in your seller account.<p>We took this action because our records indicate that this account is related to another selling account that was closed by Amazon. Once selling privileges have been removed, sellers are not allowed to establish new accounts.<p>Due to the proprietary nature of our business, we do not provide detailed information on how we determine that accounts are related.<p>We encourage you to take appropriate steps to resolve any pending orders. Note that any amounts paid as a result of A-to-z Guarantee claims and chargebacks may be deducted from your seller account.<p>After 90 days, any remaining funds will be available per your settlement schedule. Once the hold has been removed, balance and settlement information will be available in the Payments section of your seller account. If you have questions about these funds, please write topayments-funds@amazon.com.<p>While we appreciate your interest in selling on Amazon.com, the closure of this account is a permanent action.<p>Regards,<p>Seller Performance Team\nAmazon.com<p>No questions.  No hey we gotta problem here phone call.  No names.  They linked my account to a previously closed account?  Ive never sold online in my entire life before, so its impossible for me to be related to any other account.  A permanent closure?  Thinking this was a mistake I set out to get it fixed.  I quickly discovered that my only next step was to file an appeal, which is setting off red flags in my head.  Why an appeal?  Why not a 2 minute phone call with a real person?<p>The appeal was a gem.  Since Amazon couldnt be bothered to explain the logic behind their decision, they asked me to tell them why I thought they did it and how I was going to fix it.  How do you respond to a mystery accusation?  Not only do they assume my guilt, but they refuse to tell me the charges and place the burden of proof on my shouldersall without ever talking to me.  All communication has come through auto-generated emails.<p>This is their response to my appeal:<p>Hello from Amazon.com.<p>Thank you for writing. We are unable to provide detailed information on how we link related accounts.<p>However, we have thoroughly reviewed our records and confirmed that we have significant evidence that your account is related to another previously blocked account.<p>Your seller account will remain accessible to you. Please take steps to resolve your pending sales.<p>Any remaining funds may be reserved for up to 90 days from the date the account was blocked. After 90 days, the funds will be disbursed, provided we do not receive charge-backs or A-to-z Guarantee claims against your sales.  If you have further questions about your disbursement, please email payments-funds@amazon.com.<p>While we appreciate your interest in selling on Amazon.com, please understand that the closure of an account is a permanent action. Any subsequent selling accounts that are opened will be closed as well.<p>Regards,<p>Seller Performance Team\nAmazon.com<p>Total frustration.  By now its feeling like a lost cause.  Ive learned of dozens of  other seller accounts that have been closed in the same manner, with the same auto generated emails.  Feeling like I had nothing to lose, I responded with a professional yet firm email in the hopes that Id get through to a real person.  No such luck.<p>Here was their response:<p>Hello from Amazon.<p>Thank you for writing.  After a review of your account by an account specialist, we have decided not to reinstate your selling privileges.<p>We regret we are unable to provide further information on this situation. Further correspondence regarding the closure of your selling account may not be answered.<p>The closure of this account is a permanent action. Any subsequent accounts that are opened will be closed as well.<p>Regards,<p>Seller Performance Team\nAmazon.com<p>So thats it.  It is now painfully obvious that Amazon isnt interested in justice.<p>I hope my story is useful to you if you are thinking about selling on Amazon.  Dont underestimate the power they have.  With a single mouse click at 2am, they can shut down your entire business with nary a reason.  Diversify your selling sources.<p>Mike Littau",1334450721

Sorry!<p>So; taking stemming as a concrete example:<p>* With Lucene/Solr, stemming is done with a pluggable class; you can write your rules as a series of exceptions, word by word, but really you'll want to write code for anything non-trivial.  Here's an example for Norwegian: <a href=""http://e-mats.org/2009/05/modifying-a-lucene-snowball-stemmer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://e-mats.org/2009/05/modifying-a-lucene-snowball-stemme...</a><p>AWS only allows word-by-word exceptions, and only allows 500KB.  If you need more than 500KB, look like it's more undifferentiated heavy lifting for you...<p>* With AWS ""some basic algorithmic stemming is always performed, such as removing plural suffixes"".  I think that means you can't turn it off.  A lot more documentation is needed there, not least as to what these immutable rules are.<p>* Solr ships with a bunch of different languages built in; AWS appears only to support English (although I can't believe this is right!)<p>I'm sure AWS will fix some of these points eventually; but they might not consider it worthwhile to do so, or may not do so on your schedule.  With open source, you always have an option.<p>And this is just stemming!  With scoring functions, you're limited to the AWS mini-language, rather than being able to write whatever you want. etc.",1334449913

That way the product can be developed with the market and consumer in mind, specifically how it's going to get to the consumer. Tweaks can be made along the way so the the product has a more perfect market fit. Then marketing is easier because, with that person on board, ideally lots pf testing has been done to see if the product ideally fits the marketplace's demand. If consumers don't really want it, then no amount of marketing will help them to buy it. And rarely does creating a fully birthed product and only then thinking, ""Ok, now who wants to buy this and how do we get it to them?"" ever work.<p>I say, find someone non-technical or someone who focuses on this from the beginning as a co-founder. Having all hackers means sometimes people can get lost in the trees of coding without even remembering what forrest they're in. Tons and tons of exceptions to this rule obviously but certainly what I've seen. Also, it's much tougher to bring a product to a marketing person that hasn't been throughly market tested and tweaked thereof, and simply say, ""Ok, now you do the rest."" The market and consumers should always, always be in anyone's mind the entire time they're creating a product.<p>Also. There are tons of non-technical types with wealths of experience in business, marketing, etc etc. on HN.

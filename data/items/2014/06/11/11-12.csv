They&#x27;re saying that HFS+ model older design practices that aren&#x27;t relevant for modern file system designs and expectations. And what&#x27;s more, you&#x27;re kind of disproving your point with those examples:<p>* FAT32 is frequently criticised for being crap and the FAT32 variants that fix many of it&#x27;s short comings are often stuck behind Ms patents. In short, FAT32 is a terrible file system that needs to die more urgently than HFS+.<p>* ext2 isn&#x27;t really used for anything other than a direct replacement for FAT32. It&#x27;s not really a practical fs for modern systems and shouldn&#x27;t really be used on one.<p>* NTFS isn&#x27;t a static file system. It&#x27;s like saying ext is decades old when ext4 is practically a whole other file system to ext2 (while still offering some degree of backwards compatibility). NTFS is similar in the way how it has incremental versions. However even then, NTFS does still have it&#x27;s critics and, as you mentioned yourself, MS have tried to replace it on a few occasions.<p>XFS is really the only example you&#x27;ve come up with that works in your context. It&#x27;s also one of the few file systems I don&#x27;t have any personal experience with so I couldn&#x27;t answer how it&#x27;s managed to keep up with the pace of technology.",1402487979

If you get a rack or a half rack with your expected power draw and want to spill past that they&#x27;ll be charging you extra because that&#x27;s space they can&#x27;t sell to someone else. Some datacenters also provide cages, so your hardware is physically separated from other people. That&#x27;ll cost extra too.<p>The only thing I didn&#x27;t see a mention of is DC power, whereas your out of the box power supplies on most OEM equipment is for AC. Most of the server supplies nowadays should be able to handle 240V, 208V, and 120V with AC on the same unit, when you go DC you want to consider buying a separate AC power supply for setting up the server in your office (unless you drop ship it to the colo).<p>Make sure you get a very efficient power supply too, because while you can get the most efficient or power miserly server on the planet, an inefficient power supply will increase the draw significantly. You also want to right-size the power supply, because drawing too little power lowers the efficiency (there&#x27;s an efficiency curve available for most PSUs that are rated).",1402487557

You can manually dump them whenever you please, of course. These dumps are cheap, but not as cheap as fossil or ZFS (or git) snapshots. Unlike ZFS (not sure about git), these dumps are immutable, you can&#x27;t delete them.<p>With fossil+venti, you still get daily dumps, but you also get finer grained ephemeral snapshots. By default at 15 minute intervals, I used to set them at 5 minutes. You can control how long you want to keep these in fossil, I kept mine for 3 months. The dumps are venti are immutable. These are very very cheap, and these systems also do deduplication, by default.<p>I don&#x27;t run fossil anymore, I like the features, but reliability was less than stellar for some people, and the performance is much lower than cwfs, which is what I use now.

I&#x27;m not sure how true this is, but my experience is that Rails doesn&#x27;t give you a lot of help in defining where this extra logic should go. There are a lot of blogs and the like with differing suggestions about how to structure your Rails app, suggesting that this is a real problem and that there is no real consensus on how to fix them. Personally I&#x27;m happy to see a framework which builds on the best features of Rails while also trying to offer some solutions for applications that have outgrown the simple MVC structure.",1417211963

Why not just use the reform or representable gems directly?<p>2. Things like this introduce a steeper learning curve for newer rails devs, especially when they cause application architecture to deviate so much from what&#x27;s commonly found in the documentation already available.<p>3. There seems to be no real documentation on what testing facilities are available for this framework.<p>That being said, this is not bad at all for a pre 1.0 release.

The sort of looked like Fresno does today.&quot;</i><p>Oh, come on. At least in SF, that&#x27;s obvious exaggeration: San Francisco had been the west-coast center of the financial industry since before the 1980s, and most of what you see on Market street was built decades (if not a century) earlier. It looked <i>nothing like</i> Fresno.<p>If you&#x27;re referring to the economic status of the people living at mid-Market, it&#x27;s equally wrong to use it as an example where &quot;tech&quot; is making things better: The Tenderloin was a blue-collar neighborhood before the war. It gradually descended into property as the rest of the city gentrified around it, leaving few places for working-class people to go. Gentrification absolutely made things <i>worse</i> in the Tenderloin.<p>Mid-Market&#x27;s decline came as part of the larger Tenderloin decline, but also as the result of BART construction, which killed business on the road in the 60s. SOMA was light industrial in the 1960s and 1970s, but by the late 1980s, this area was beginning to gentrify as well. For example, entire blocks of SRO housing were eliminated during the 1980s to build Moscone Center.<p>About the only thing you can say regarding the &quot;tech industry&quot; is that it&#x27;s the latest gentrifying wave of many, all of which have undoubtedly made things nicer for rich people, and worse for poor people.

Diving into the django source to figure out a problem was a nightmare.<p>In terms of actually using it, the biggest strength is the concurrency model.<p>It handles blocking much better than rails or django where you typically have a fixed number of workers, and if you block and fill up those workers then you&#x27;re SOL. Yea there are workarounds here, but they&#x27;re pretty ugly. python and ruby don&#x27;t really have nice solutions for this, which brings us to node. In node, you always need to be actively thinking about handling async IO with callbacks or promises or whatever, and you can quickly end up in callback hell if you aren&#x27;t careful.<p>In elixir (and erlang), BEAM handles all that hard stuff. The result is your code is easier to write and read. Every phoenix http request is in its own elixir  process. There&#x27;s no weird request context like you get in flask, no way to abuse request state, and no callbacks to deal with. You can block a process all you want and throughput will be the same. The code looks like it executes sequentially, even though it doesn&#x27;t.<p>For a small app like the one I wrote, it also has the advantage of being able to start a bunch of little services in the background to handle longer running tasks (which would typically be handled by a message queue with django/rails) and they&#x27;re super easy to deal with since it&#x27;s just standard elixir process messaging. These services handle things like performance logging, emailing, as well as (in the case of my app) looking for vulnerability disclosures and resolving them to package specs.<p>Anyway, sorry for the rambling response, but I hope it gives a general overview of why elixir and phoenix made building something way more pleasant than what I&#x27;m used to.<p>Why do you ask about the test suite?

8672187,comment,8670014,8670102,0,0,kansface,,,"React JS is a front end framework that understands how to render stuff (html) in real time <i>reactively</i> to changes in state.  React does magic with the shadow DOM, the actual DOM, and diffs in order to minimize reflows and boilerplate.  Probably the biggest downside to this approach is interacting with legacy JS animations because:<p>1. ReactJS owns the DOM it renders.  The nodes in the DOM are subject to change or even disappear at any time.  React allows for hooks, but will throw exceptions if a third party fucks with the DOM under its control too much.<p>2. ReactJS owns the data (state) that controls rendering.  Moreover, the state tends to be buried inside some nested React Element.  Ordinarily, we would move the state outside of react and just update the components when the state changes (per Flux guidelines), but this is quite awkward when the state is for something like pixel offsets of a DOM node or some intermediate step in an animation- the component that does the rendering should own this information conceptually.<p>CSS animations tend to suck in practice- they aren&#x27;t very flexible and they can&#x27;t be controlled from JS (they go until completion).  Existing JS frameworks for animations (eg JQueryUI) cause as much trouble as they provide solutions.  The new library provides the correct solution- control animations from within React Elements themselves via a React Mixin.",1417209075

Eventually the rural population will be entirely composed of maniac bandits driving burnt out plymouth dusters with mounted machine gun turrets and terrified hill people raising rabbits for food in their back yards.<p>But for serious, as we see urbanization pick up, the rural areas are going to continue their downward slide. And as the trend toward suburbanization has reversed we&#x27;re going to see the suburbs become the new &quot;burnt out inner city&quot;—because inner city is no longer synonymous with poverty and crime.",1417208567

Something like, say, a VM, that&#x27;s a piece of piss to code in a language that allows mutable state can become an interminable mess of gobbledygook or just a huge pain in the ass in a lanugage where the means for passing data structures is too verbose or complicated (like say, Scheme/Racket structs).<p>This is why the &#x27;fancy types&#x27; in Haskell, I realized, and the robust syntax for dealing with them. Because they become the main medium for communication within your program in anything non-trivial, and you need that process to be as frictionless as possible for the FP approach to not fall apart completely into a very tedious sort of chaos.",1417208499

8672151,comment,8671618,8672033,0,0,chrismccord,,,"Sure. So let me start by saying I have worked full-time in Ruby/Rails at a Rails shop for the last four years. Phoenix is derived from that experience, and we borrow some great ideas from Rails.<p>Pro - Concurrency:\nI really love Ruby/Rails, but what led me to Elixir in the first place was constantly dealing with lack of concurrency in Rails and being unable to do anything like websockets in a sane way. For example, in Rails we can&#x27;t really block in the controller without killing throughput, so we go to great lengths to background <i>everything</i>. This makes simple problems like &quot;Make a remote API request through a controller&quot; way harder since we now have to throw it in a worker queue, then poll from the client on the status of the job, then finally return the result. In Elixir/Phoenix, we can block in controllers without a blip on throughput, do our work, and return the response.<p>Pro - Error Handling / Fault tolerance\nI won&#x27;t go into too much details here, but the Erlang/OTP way of building applications around Supervisors and responding to failures has really blown me away. Erlangers have been sitting on this innovation for the last couple decades so it&#x27;s battle tested and has proven its merits. Look at WhatsApp, 1-2 million connections per server, 400 million users ~ 30 engineers.<p>Pro - &quot;Realtime&quot; / pubsub:\nPhoenix also ships with a realtime layer that we call &quot;Channels&quot; for doing pubsub/realtime events to clients. Our goal is to make building realtime applications as straight forward as building REST endpoints. We include a `phoenix.js` browser client, but we are targeting multiplatorm support and have a working Swift client internally. So Phoenix aims to go beyond a typical &quot;Web Framework&quot;. The Web is more than just html apps (but Phoenix excels as just that). Imagine a iOS game publishing on Phoenix channels to other iOS clients, and a Web front-end reporting world events, player lists, etc. Phoenix can power all of it. By virtue of the Erlang VM, we also get cluster support For Free. You can run multiple phoenix nodes on a cluster and PubSub Just Works. No need for redis in b/w or worrying about sticky sessions. Concurrency in Elixir is location transparent. A process is a process regardless of machine it runs on in a cluster.<p>Cons - Packages, Training:\nMy goals are to wholesale replace all my Rails work with Phoenix, but obviously we have a ways to go. The main cons are lack of off-the-shelf community packages like in Rails land. We are also not yet at 1.0, so you have to be willing to put up with breaking changes until we&#x27;re ready to brand a 1.0 release next year. I&#x27;m using it for prod systems, but this is an upfront reality as we march towards 1.0. Other cons would be having to train folks new to Elixir, which often means learning a number of new paradigms at the same time. There&#x27;s a helpful Elixir community for newcomers, but it will take more upfront work to get up to speed if you&#x27;re coming from an OO background.<p>Hope that helps. Ruby folks might find my RailsConf Elixir workshop helpful as a place to get started in Elixir: <a href=""http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3488-railsconf-workshop-all-aboard-the-elixir-express"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3488-railsconf-workshop-all-...</a><p>freenode #elixir-lang irc is also a great resource for questions.",1417208443

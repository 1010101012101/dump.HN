&quot;Sal Khan made little YouTube videos to teach a family member maths. Other people watched them and found them useful. Bill Gates discovered them and threw money at them. Now there are heaps of videos, with some back up exercises, and some people think this is the best thing to happen to maths (and other) education&quot;
I think people are jealous because Salman Khan did something which other people might also do but they didn&#x27;t! Even if they did, money might be the main motive where for Khan Academy, its the free & better education. 
Update: I was reading comments and found that lady saying &quot;Unfortunately they take a lot of effort to make when you do it properly, and I dont have the backing of Bill Gates.&quot; This is ridiculous.",1377863960

It&#x27;s convenient, since the OOM-killer tries to not kill init (for bad things happen when you kill init), so it&#x27;s a somewhat-safe place to put supervisory logic. One of the better calls Canonical has made, I think. :)<p>Still, in your use-case, I&#x27;d definitely recommend only letting users run their &quot;wild code&quot; inside a memory cgroup+process namespace (e.g. an LXC container.)<p>Crash-only systems only work when a faulty component crashes itself before it crashes you. Processes modellable as mutually-untrustworthy agents should always have a failure boundary drawn between them. (User A shouldn&#x27;t be able to bring down the cluster-agent; but they shouldn&#x27;t be able to snipe user B&#x27;s job by OOMing their job on the same cluster node, either.)

The current OOM algorithm in Linux sums up the memory usage of a process and all its children.  So there are good chances that the restarter process is killed first, and <i>then</i> the main software is killed too (when OOM killer realizes the last kill didn&#x27;t free enough memory).<p>This is exactly the problem we&#x27;re facing at work here: on a computational cluster, users sometimes start wild code that consumes all the memory, but the OOM decides to kill the batch-queue daemon first, because it&#x27;s the root of all misbehaving processes.  We have to explcitly set `oom_adj` on the important daemons to prevent the machines from becoming unresponsive because of a bad OOM decision.",1377863106

So you could get asylum from Italy or France, then move to Berlin when you have your papers, which takes several months during which you can&#x27;t have a declared job (in France, they may make sure you don&#x27;t work by sending you to a transit camp, which is basically a jail).<p>If you tell them you&#x27;re an experimented software engineer, it may be much faster to get a work visa than asylum. Ask for this work visa to each embassy in Damascus.<p>Also, Morrocoan cities are growing like crazy. There may be some business to do there and they may give visas more easily.",1377860871

6301106,comment,6300063,6300063,1,0,shameless_1,,,"Scaling to a 128 bit system is pretty hard on the layout level. On current designs, something like 95% of the surface is metal interconnects. Where there&#x27;s metal you&#x27;re limited in freedom to place transistors. So with 128-bit systems you&#x27;re looking at 128-bit registers, address buses and data buses. Those take up a lot of real estate on the die and you can only go so far in narrowing them by using layers. 128-bit is a really really wide highway on a CPU.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that 128-bit systems can&#x27;t be built. What it does mean is that upgrading a current 64-bit CPU to a 128-bit CPU involves sacrifices. Current-gen 64-bit systems contain a lot of optimizations in silico (branch predictors, cache predictors, ...) and control structures and that&#x27;s where the problem lies: each optimization (literally) taps into that wide highway and creates dead zones on the die that contain nothing more than metal. And everywhere you tap you create zones where layering can only be applied with reduced freedom.",1377860843

Sweden will accept you based on your skills far more easily than Germany, all you need is to find a job, and right now the market is open for a guy of your skills - programmers are in high demand. Look around on various Sweden/Stockholm job posting sites, from there you get the visa and safety. The startup scene is also nice.<p>As someone else mentioned in Germany as asylum seeker you arent allowed to work. You can come to Sweden and seek asylum and you&#x27;d be allowed to work, and when you do sign a contract then you can get a permit to stay and cancel the asylum request. PM me and Ill give you names of good companies that are on the lookout to hire.<p>As others said, to be able to apply for asylum in EU country X, you have to first set foot in that country X and not in another one, so, go to Turkey or Israel and then fly to Sweden from there.<p>Sweden is also more flexible, its a country where they look out for the best interest of you as a human (mostly), so if you come to Sweden and continue working for Australian company - it is enough to get a work permit, all you have to do is prove that you earn more than minimum amount, I believe around 1500usd and pay taxes, to be accepted.<p>As a war refugee my self, I urge you strongly to leave Syria now, for the love of god no matter the price, buy those tickets and get the hell out of there and far away as possible, Sweden, Canada, Australia. (Not Germany, France, Italy, USA, Turkey they all suck.)<p>Your life is all you got, dont waste it on that war. Take with your closest family if you can.",1377860648

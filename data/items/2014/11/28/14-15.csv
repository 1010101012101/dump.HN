8671061,comment,8669625,8669625,0,0,seliopou,,,"> Yellow taxis in New York also face competition from new green “boro taxis,” which may pick up fares only in the boroughs outside Manhattan and in northern Manhattan. That program has been in the works for three years, including during a period when medallion prices were still rising. The vast majority of yellow cab pickups occur in Manhattan below 110th Street or at airports, where yellow cabs face competition from Uber but not from green cabs. Still, the green cab program has faced strong opposition from yellow cab medallion owners, and the start of falling medallion prices coincides with a June 2013 court ruling upholding the green cab program.<p>Did anybody read this? My understanding is that green taxi medallions started selling at around $5,000 when they were introduced, and green taxis are now fairly common in the outer boroughs. You also see them quite a bit in lower Manhattan as well (dropping off fares).<p>Also, did anybody look at that chart? Prices haven&#x27;t been stable for the entire time span that the chart covers, and the current price isn&#x27;t even the min for the data set.<p>Uber&#x27;s been operating in New York since well before 2013. It just so happens that the (three month as indicated by the chart, mind you) decline coincided with a court decision that upheld a city policy that would put more cabs on the streets in areas of the city that are booming right now.<p>On top of that, I wonder if there are any other macroeconomic trends that might be affecting medallion prices and ridership overall. Mind you, if total taxi-like revenue for the last given period is R = T + U, where U is Uber&#x27;s share of the revenue and T is the rest, and the next period&#x27;s revenue is R&#x27; < R, then it&#x27;s completely consistent to have T&#x27; < T and U&#x27; > U. In other words, total taxi-like revenue can be on the decline even as Uber&#x27;s revenues are increasing. This could be because the Uber service is cheaper, or because people are overall using taxis less. Who knows if this is actually happening? I don&#x27;t. But it&#x27;d be interesting to see the question raised and pursued, even to be quickly dismissed by some obvious fact.<p>Don&#x27;t mistake this article for economic analysis. It&#x27;s a puff piece.",1417186254

The conclusion I&#x27;ve come down to, is that the app has to take some responsibility to provide for consistent backups, either via checkpoints / write barriers, or via a quiesce command that can finalize in-flight transactions, and pause / buffer operations long enough for a volume snapshot to take place.  The other thing I&#x27;ve seen apps do is provide a data export functionality, so you end up backing up the export file not the live data.  But that requires extra time and disk space.  Another option is to run the app in a VM, and do a live VM snapshot which includes the running state of the VM.<p>Bottom line is if you can&#x27;t live backup your app, file a bug report with the app vendor.  Although it would be really nice if there were standards in this area, so that a backup tool would just need to call one operation to put all supported apps into a hot-backup mode.",1417185979

The general problem is that the interface that is optimal for the experienced user (terse, lots of syntax) is not best for learning. All UIs (such as programming languages -- an interface to the machine) must determine where they fall on this particular continuum.<p>My personal beef is the use of the Latex extended character set to typeset Haskell code in papers.

There are two things that it does not do, encryption and block-level deduplication.  For encryption, my preference is to write it to an encrypted volume.  And block-level deduplication would require inventing another proprietary storage format, which I try to avoid.<p>It works a lot like rsnapshot (each backup is a self contained snapshot of a system at that point in time, and only the incremental changes are transferred to the backup server), but with compression and full file level deduplication (not only across backup generations, but across all files including ones from multiple clients).  It uses GNU `find` and `tar` on the client to do the heavy lifting of getting the files (so only a simple shell script is needed on the client, and then only if you are doing push backups).  On the backend side, it stores the metadata in an SQLite table, and individual files are stored in a vault directory using lzop compatible compression.<p>The advantages over tools like rsnapshot is that it has compression, full file level deduplication, and metadata is stored in a DB file (which avoids a large hardlink-farm for dedup (avoiding problems like <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8305283"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8305283</a>), also removes the need for root privileges on the backup server to store file ownership/permissions).  The disadvantages compared to other tools, is it doesn&#x27;t do encryption on the client (this would break dedup if done right, and I&#x27;d rather leave encryption to the experts), and it only does file level dedup, so isn&#x27;t suitable for backing up VM image files (unless you combine it with something like  libguestfs, something I&#x27;ll document in an upcoming release).<p>There are also some nice-to-have features, for example if you have a job to expire all daily backups older than 10 days, and monthly older than 6 months -- and you have a host that hasn&#x27;t been running / backed up for a year, the expire job will keep a minimum number of backups for each host (default 3 backups, but is tuneable).  And the next major release will support multiple repositories, so you can move old backup sets to archival storage (external USB disks, possibly tape library support, etc).  Also included is support for storing extended / SElinux attributes, and the current client shell script has a plugin architecture to execute pre/post backup steps for app-specific backups, such as Oracle hot backups.<p>Edit: for Windows backups, I&#x27;m currently running it under Cygwin.  But I&#x27;m not able to preserve Windows specific permissions.  To fix this, I need a &quot;tar&quot; implementation for Windows which stores the extended ACL information in PAX headers in the tar file, similar to how Red Hat&#x27;s patched GNU tar does SElinux attributes.  If I can&#x27;t find something, I may take a crack at it myself.",1417183850

And then you are disingenuous enough to only look at the README and not at the provided manpages and other material. inotify actually has pretty good documentation.

It is my understanding that it is a counter-productive thing, though. Just like how with &#x27;frameworks&#x27; imperative programmers lose perception of the technical debt they incur by not knowing what their code actually does.<p>Maybe this line of thought is not universal but I&#x27;d presume the majority of programmers would be afraid to submit code to a project where they don&#x27;t really know the notational mix and syntactic sugar in use.",1417183616

8670938,comment,8669625,8669625,0,0,bluedevil2k,,,"The article doesn&#x27;t touch upon the illiquidity of the taxi medallions in these cities.  In most of them, once you buy the taxi medallion, it&#x27;s difficult or impossible to sell again.  Even in cities where you can sell it (San Francisco), you get a fraction of what you paid for it (30% typically).  This distorts the market even further, when the buyers need to price in the fact that these are assets that in some cases might depreciate to $0, and not give them the ability to sell them before that happens.  Additionally, there&#x27;s no price feedback, or it happens rarely.  As the article points out, NYC publishes the price once a year, and did it incorrectly last year.  What type of investment gives you no feedback on its current value?<p>To reduce the price swings, cities need to create an auction system where they allow current owners of medallions to list their current medallions for sale.  The auction system would provide price transparency, and allow all the stakeholders involved (medallion holders, buyers, and sellers) to get a clear picture of the market price at any given point.",1417183590

Basically, this is going from a standing position to fully prostrate, 108 times. This is quite a workout. This awakens the body.\n2) 4:00a: chanting. This is done in ancient Chinese, and you honestly have no idea what you are saying. It&#x27;s not important, though. This awakens the mind.\n3) 5:00a: Sitting meditation. This brings the other two together. This awakens the self.<p>What I took away from this experience was that the benefits of exercise when combined with meditation are quite powerful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.musangsa.org/english/sub04/sub04_4.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.musangsa.org/english/sub04/sub04_4.php</a>",1417183469

The normal way of avoiding this by multiplying all your values by the cofactor isn&#x27;t readily available when you&#x27;re doing some ugly trick of constructing points with no known discrete log from a hash.<p>Ah, a partition attack. Could you fix this with more ugly by just iterating the hashing/munging process until your commitment was in a predetermined subgroup? I&#x27;m not at all familiar with EC subgroup theory, but the EC-SRP scheme proposed already does some deterministic munging to select the y-coordinate. Of course, even if you can do this, you&#x27;re open to another timing side-channel.",1417183389

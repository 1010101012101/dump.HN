Here is the simplest possible convention I can think of that requires the smallest amount of memorization:<p>- Forget about all semicolons, single or double (just think of ;; as a way to press enter in the top interactive REPL).<p>- Module bodies (like every file by default) are just exporting a series of bindings. If you want to evaluate an imperative command inside a module body, export its result to &quot;_&quot;.<p>- Function bodies <i>are</i> expressions. If you want to evaluate an imperative command inside a function body (or any other expression), use `let in` like you would for any other temporary variable, but use the variable name &quot;_&quot; and simply don&#x27;t use it.",1434272384

Writing software requires time and efforts. You&#x27;re giving the example of employed engineers, but what about the rest ? Engineers are a minority of programmers, they&#x27;re employed, what about the unemployed who want to make something? Just contribute some patches and hope for an interview ?

9714239,comment,9711367,9712418,0,0,danieldk,,,"tl;dr: Go is a dumb language because it does not provide enough abstraction. (Or with the underlying tone: Go users are just to dumb to understand superior languages.)<p>I agree and disagree with all your points. I have written C++ and Prolog professionally for years, then some Java (because employer), with a little Haskell on the side (hobby projects).<p>I am in a bind when it comes to PLs. I prefer the abstraction of C++ and Haskell (or Prolog for the domains where it fits). On the other hand, it is easier in powerful languages to get complete mismatches between the level of abstraction and the abstractions that are used. To take three widely-used C++ libraries as an example:<p>- Boost: highly template and template meta-programming driven.<p>- Qt: basically C++ as C with classes, with moc for signals. Really only templates for collections.<p>- Xerces/XQilla: 90ies style C++ with global state, and too many Java SingletonFactoryProxies.<p>In projects where you use different dependencies with different styles, things can get ugly. Also, your policy-based design may not be understandable to your &#x27;C++ is C with classes&#x27; colleagues/contributors.<p>In the end there will always be interaction between expressiveness and maintainability/accessibility. The right abstractions can improve both. Too much magic (page-long type signatures, too many levels of templated indirection, etc.) can make everyone&#x27;s lives miserable. The graveyard of ugly C++ libraries shows that finding the right abstractions can be hard, even for experienced programmers.",1434271758

There are crucially important things that are currently being stabilized, and delaying those for an additional three release cycles would just be an arbitrary obstacle for those seeking to shift their code from nightly to stable.<p>We also don&#x27;t need three release cycles to get feedback because we&#x27;ve been collecting feedback all throughout the 1.0-alpha and 1.0-beta cycles. Now would be the worst time to institute a freeze on API additions because of all the APIs that people are clamoring for but that didn&#x27;t make it to stable for 1.0 (<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24028"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24028</a>).<p>We&#x27;re also working closely with several dozen companies using Rust to determine what development to prioritize (if you would like to add your company to this list, then please see the email address in my HN profile).

I find these three things to be very impressive and notable myself, although I am obviously very biased. I should note that this is not an exhaustive list, it’s more just the three examples I am most familiar with and wanted to take the time to write up.<p>First, the abstract thing. I don’t know if most engineers outside Facebook appreciate how much activity there is on the site each day. Hundreds of billions of likes and comments. Billions of photos uploaded. Trillions of photos consumed. And growing each day.<p>And this is for an “online application” in the sense that the data is live and constantly changing. We’re not talking about crawling the web, storing it, doing offline processing, and then building a bunch of indices (which is a different but still legit kind of hard). This is an immense amount of live data producing an even more immense stream of live events; trillions and trillions and trillions that need processing, live and on the fly, every day. It is hard to underestimate how difficult it was to build an application and backend that could drive this kind of social platform. In terms of liveness and scale, there really is nothing out there that can touch Facebook, by orders of magnitude. That is a solved Hard problem in my opinion, if not a meta one. But in my opinion, the largest one.<p>Here’s two concrete things that I thought are good examples of some Hard problems that Facebook has solved:<p>1. A global media storage platform that each day is capable of ingesting billions of new photos and videos and delivering trillions as well. This includes Haystack, F4, and Cold Storage, which store hot/warm/cold media objects for Facebook. Each storage layer has specialized, custom software running on distinct storage hardware designed to take advantage of the requirements for each layer. Facebook is the largest photo sharing site in the world by orders of magnitude, and they had to build a very custom photos backend to handle the immense load. I’m not even mentioning their terabit class Edge platform which has a global constellation of POPs that accelerates application traffic and caches popular content close to users. Facebook’s global media storage and delivery platform is truly a unique asset.<p>2. A datacenter architecture focused on high power efficiency and flexible workloads, comprised of custom built: datacenters, racks, servers, storage nodes, network fabric, rack switches, and aggregation switches. Plus some other things that haven’t been made public yet. This architecture let application developers stop working around various physical performance bottlenecks with compute, storage, cache, and network, and instead just focus on optimizing what was best for the application. At the same time, this new architecture also greatly reduced infrastructure costs.<p>There are other solved Hard problems I can talk about that are public, and others that I wish I could talk about that aren’t yet. However, I’m not trying to exhaustively defend what Facebook has built, I more just wanted to respond and show a few examples of the very special scale Facebook has and some of the extremely hard problems they’ve had to solve.",1434269190

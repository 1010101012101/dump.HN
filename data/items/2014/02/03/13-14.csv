7170615,comment,7169712,7170125,4,0,NotOscarWilde,,,"Why should moderate disclosure be a lose-lose situation? If Google has a problem with entering a country that is dependent on the country&#x27;s laws or policies, explaining the problem to the local citizens could lead to public discourse about the laws and, eventually, change.<p>Zero disclosure is a winning strategy only because people will use their imaginations and think there are valid reasons for the progress being so slow. The people will argue that the reason Google is not telling us is <i>the policy</i> and not the fact that they don&#x27;t have a good reason.<p>---<p>This discussion reminds me of the famous quote from Eric Schmidt:<p>&quot;If you have something that you don&#x27;t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be doing it in the first place.&quot;<p>Does that rule apply to Google disclosures as well?",1391435960

I introduced my friend and his partner to this strange guy in Dearborn, Michigan. There were meetings at the airport and in his office in Dearborn. This guy claimed to be a wizard at arbitrage and arcane financial instruments. He said he worked out all the algorithms for Ford Motor for hedging copper futures. He was overweight, had greasy hair, and, I kid you not, his back pockets were usually turned inside out. We figured, eccentric genius. At least at first. All he ever provided were excuses. He was waiting to flip some sort of bond issue overseas that would give him $10 million, etc.  That business never got off the ground.<p>Then a year later my own partner and I got a call. We had been looking for a manufacturing business to acquire. The crazy guy had a contact in Chicago who was looking for an operations team to come in on a deal to acquire a manufacturer of audio mixing boards. This company was still run by the founder who had practically invented the industry. There were 50 employees and customers included major studios and venues around the world, including the US Senate and the Kremlin.   The deal maker, lets call him DB, proposed that each of four partners -the founder, me, my partner, and him- put $25K into a holding company. He would arrange a $250K line of credit from the Korean bank in Chicago that he was friends with. Then we would operate the company out of bankruptcy.   Well we three each sent him $25K (my dad lent me the money). We did all the legal paper work, and I showed up the next day as one of the new owners of a $3 million/year company. Very exciting for a 27 yr old.   To make the story short. DB was a complete crook. He needed $75K to pay off someone else he had screwed and was threatening his life. The business shut down. 50 people lost their jobs. It took me years to get back on my feet financially.",1391435541

Most real world challenges are simple P problems or NP problems on a very small scale.  Sample the angular position of all four wheels a thousand times per second, calculate the apparent angular acceleration, cross check with the other wheels, and if its ridiculous, modulate the brakes a hundred times per second.  Even if that problem wouldn&#x27;t scale to 5000 wheeled vehicles, that simply doesn&#x27;t matter to our 4 wheeled cars, or even 18 wheel semi trucks.  Or TLDR most real world problems are either P or small enough scale NP not to matter.<p>2) &quot;computers being able to quickly solve problems&quot;  More like anything being able to solve problems.  Classic computer limits are FP multiplier speed, memory limits, stuff like that.  This is a problem solving limitation inherent to the class of problem, not a computer technology limitation.  A classic Searle Chinese Room emulating a processor, or a single human brain, is just as limited by NP problem solving limitations.  Or something along the lines of this problem will not be solved by making a better computer.<p>3) &quot;Unfortunately, many with computer science degrees&quot;  rewrite to &quot;Unfortunately, many computer science degree programs don&#x27;t require a class in automata theory...&quot;<p>Please don&#x27;t overestimate three minor editorial comments; it is a good introductory article.",1391434381

It requires some refactoring of the build process, but shouldn&#x27;t impact the application code, the two libraries can coexist (not cooperate I guess, but at least you can set up both and use one or the other as you want), and can be tested with simple use cases first and expanded to the whole app afterwards.<p>The barrier to entry is low, it doesn&#x27;t require much commitment and can be done on the side. I&#x27;d try to keep up as much as possible with new available tools, as long as they match the above criteria.<p>For libraries and frameworks closer to the UI and application structure, I have the feeling they generally need more time to pickup, learn the strengths weaknesses, deal with the quirks and bugs. Even with reasonable documentation, most of them seem to need at least a few dives into the source code to really get how they work and what they expect to be doing.<p>Trying Ember or Angular on a somewhat real<i>ish</i> project takes enough time to make it a chore to try a few alternatives, I&#x27;d guess most devs would want to wait months or years to see which libraries die in infancy. I think for this space, trying more than one or two picks here and there a few months apart is just insanity, except if you really enjoy it or it&#x27;s part of your job. As time goes by I feel the timespan I wait for something to see if t sticks goes longer. I remember a Jeff Atwood post [1], about how ruby is now mature enough to be taken seriously.<p>I think the same thought process can be applied to big enough frameworks.<p>Personally I&#x27;d tend to go for the libraries that are simpler or with the least &#x27;magic&#x27; to avoid getting in situation where I invested weeks doing something and there&#x27;s bug I don&#x27;t know where it comes from and need to spend days on it because of the amount of abstraction going on.

I understand that people perhaps feel trapped or exploited in a very limited number of industries because the competition for the jobs are so fierce. But like I said in reply to someone else, someone can make the case that open source contributors are being exploited since they are essentially working for free, and there are companies making use of their work without contributing back. Professional programmers, one could argue, is therefore making less money or loosing out on a lot of business. But you know what? It was the open source contributor&#x27;s choice under which terms he or she would release the software. I like treating other people like adults, and not thinking that <i>I</i> know what is best for <i>them</i>.

I got &#x27;in on the ground floor&#x27;, and I don&#x27;t care that it isn&#x27;t valuable (although yes, I would have been happier if it did become valuable, of course...). I&#x27;ll probably stop mining at some point soon, but I have the coins, and having a big number is a nice feeling. Plus, it&#x27;s funny.",1391432492

Ditto &quot;product manager&quot; role.<p>Also you need to evaluate yourself by your own metrics.  In the grand scheme of things over human history having a &quot;career&quot; and &quot;advancement&quot; is unusual, apparently temporary, and is going away, back to the way it was.  Being born into a declining economic era is not a personal failure worth feeling stressfully responsible about.  Work to live vs live to work and all that.",1391432464

There&#x27;s a serious lack of people doing that, because it requires both technical chops to understand the material plus a large time and skill-development commitment to do the actual writing.  In an ideal world, you&#x27;d have the opportunity to do some serious tinkering with a couple of brand-new technologies a year, then be the first to write for a very hungry audience, then you&#x27;d move on.  Combine that with some speaking and more speculative commentary, and it could even get pretty lucrative.",1391432456

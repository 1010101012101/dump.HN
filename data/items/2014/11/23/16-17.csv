Musk had changed his demands. He now wanted a staggering $500 million in cash upfront instead of some of the tax abatements. This was simply impossible for Nevada. The state didn’t have that kind of money—its entire budget is just $6.5 billion—and it wasn’t about to write a half-billion-dollar check.<p>>For a second time, Nevada’s team braced itself and said no. “The conversations got pretty darn tense,” says Hill. “Tesla was not happy.”<p>>The company made its pique apparent: On July 23 it shut down the grading work outside Reno, abruptly sending 240 construction workers home. O’Connell explains Tesla’s attitude this way: “Okay, fine, if it’s not going to work in Nevada, we’ll take our shovel and go somewhere else.”",1416761882

The fact is that if all of these states had just told Tesla to screw off and not offered anything, the factory would be built in the most economically efficient spot in the US, boost the national economy, and provide jobs. And if Nevada didn&#x27;t win this factory, it would win the next one - without paying $1.4B to do it.<p>Instead, Tesla used their outsize market influence to shake down the state for as much cash as possible. In the absence of these payoffs, states would have to compete on &#x27;business-friendliness&#x27; by changing their tax structure or building permit process - improvements which would be good for all businesses.

It&#x27;s hard to say that your good example isn&#x27;t better than the bad. but equally, as an upcoming programmer one should be aware of options, pitfalls, and also attitudes of programmers and how to balance them against their own experiences, desires and perspectives.<p>So, I think you wrote this for the wrong audience. Instead of targeting programmers (who are notoriously opinionated) you might have a more effective message if you directed it towards the upcoming programmers themselves. Understanding that you will hear such opinions a lot and how to properly cope/respond is far more effective and useful than trying to change the language of programmers everywhere.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say there&#x27;s no value in bringing this type of behavior to light and offering a better way, but I think giving those who are more fragile about it some resilience would have better reach.",1416761446

I&#x27;ve recently done something similar with the OpenPGP Smartcard V2[1] (YubiKey seems nicer now, but I don&#x27;t think they existed when I got mine. In any case, they both seem to perform the same GPG operations, mine can also only hold 3 subkeys, etc).<p>> In addition my main key is ~elsewhere~: After loading three subkeys on the yubikey I saved and removed my main key from the keychain. This _should_ solve the problem of the airgap in this article? A reasonable way to get access to your data/mail without giving access to your secret key?<p>The way I understand it the reason for keeping your main key seperate from the card is so that in case you lose the card you can still issue revocations and issue new keys signed by your master key. The smartcard still contains three seperate secret keys, but does indeed not expose them to the computer.<p>> I&#x27;m confused about the key backup solutions here. Keys generated on the smart card cannot be backed up as far as I can see. I have a decent idea of how I&#x27;m going to handle my master key (both where and how I&#x27;ll store it safely), but .. the rest is still not quite clear to me<p>Personally I&#x27;ve opted against having my smartcard generate the keys, because like you said this means it is impossible to extract the subkey used for encryption. Instead I generated the keys on a Raspberry Pi, used paperkey[2] to print them to paper (don&#x27;t forget to also print some instructions on how to restore, in case you forget or someone else has to do it), and also burned them to a few CDROMs. Then I transferred them to the smartcard, keeping them on the Raspberry Pi&#x27;s SD card as well, which I keep in a secure location with the CDRoms.<p>> Mobile. So, if my day to day keys are on this smart card, I cannot read those mails on my mobile. Which .. might be a good thing when we talk about security, but a PITA for my day to day usage. No idea how or if I can solve this one<p>I&#x27;ve been wondering if it would be possible to install opengpg on a rooted android phone and then seeing if it were possible to connect it to an usb smartcard reader using an OTG cable, but honestly I think that&#x27;d mostly just be a lot of wasted time and effort, and possibly insecure. I tend to carry a chromebook around and instead use that.<p>> But back to the article: If you&#x27;re in the &quot;whistle-blowers, activists, spies&quot; category, is the airgap (physically) really required or would a smart card give you the same protection?<p>I think a smart card could give you similar protection, if it were to work perfectly. I don&#x27;t think we can be absolutely certain they aren&#x27;t backdoored, which is easier to make sure with a basic linux install on a computer that has never seen the internet. Additionally, if you were to use a smart card on a computer attached to the network, the plaintext would exist on that computer at some point which would be a problem if a keylogger or similar were present.<p>[1] <a href=""http://shop.kernelconcepts.de/product_info.php?products_id=42"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.kernelconcepts.de/product_info.php?products_id=4...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.jabberwocky.com/software/paperkey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jabberwocky.com/software/paperkey/</a>",1416760110

8649118,comment,8646620,8647816,0,0,tripzilch,,,"Agreed, but if you did it right (that is, heat the meat through and through at the correct temperature[0]), really you shouldn&#x27;t sear it for more than 15-20 seconds on both sides. The meat is already done, searing is just for the Maillard reaction creating a browned crust on the outside, adding flavour. Any additional heating beyond that just increases the size of the transition between (hot) brown crust outside and (less hot) perfectly done meat inside, and it is that transition layer that makes a steak tough. Which is exactly the (somewhat) hard thing about cooking a proper steak, the very thing you&#x27;re trying to solve with sous vide.<p>That is the reason why they sometimes attack a sous vide steak with a butane torch.

Several times a day, Firefox goes unresponsive for a few seconds.  That does not make Firefox unusable or unsatisfactory, but not being able to rely on a timely response from Firefox 100% of the time to a keypress or pointing-device input really does seem to change the way I use Firefox.<p>Anyone with experience with math, even with doing multiplications and divisions in one&#x27;s head, can see that how much complexity the mind can handle is dependent on how quickly one can execute sub-tasks. That is an example of the general principle getting fast -- reliably fast -- at the sub-tasks increases the complexity of the tasks one can handle (and of course it is the reliable quickness of small sub-tasks that glitchiness of the user experience interferes with).<p>Those without experience with Emacs or Vim (which I am guessing is like Emacs in being 100% responsive) can get an idea of what I mean by comparing their experience in using Firefox or Google Chrome with their experience of using a terminal-emulation app and a Unix shell: although some shell command lines do take a while to produce a response from the system, most of the time, the user can predict when a delay will occur (e.g., a `find` over the whole directory hierarchy) and even when the user is surprised by the presence of a delay, in retrospect there is always a reasonable explanation for the delay if the user is willing to think through and learn about enough details about the system.<p>(Yes, I realize that there are some applications that some people would like to write in Emacs Lisp that simply cannot be written without concurrency without blocking Emacs for many many seconds at a time. I am skeptical that being able to write those application in Emacs Lisp is worth the cost in complexity and in glitchiness of the user experience.)<p>The above is a simplification: in reality, glitches do happen in Emacs and in an interactive Unix shell, <i>but</i> I am almost sure that the cause of those glitches is in the underlying OS, not in the Emacs or the Unix-shell process.",1416759761

It was an ultimatum that was forced on Goldman, Morgan Stanley and a few others.[0]<p>Somethings worked out for them, BUT they did give up quite a lot along the way.<p>Regardless the article is not well balanced and presented in a way that breeds misinformation. Quote from the end of the article - about a quote from the fed:<p><pre><code>   In its analysis, the Fed added that **Goldman had asked** the Fed to determine if the grandfather clause permitted the activities to continue. But the analysis said that the Fed’s lawyers were still considering that request.\n</code></pre>\nSo Goldman is in the wrong because the Fed&#x27;s can&#x27;t decide what&#x27;s permitted and what&#x27;s not? If anything Goldman should get points for asking.<p>If past behavior in compliance is any indicator to future compliance I would like to bring attention to the following:<p>- One of the things that was clear early was that proprietary trading[1] was a big NO under the next bank status and TARP conditions and had to be wound down by 2014.<p>- Goldman Sachs shut that business down in under 4 months. It&#x27;s worth noting that they were probably the best trading desks with consistent great results.<p>- Most other banks kept their trading desks around till quite recently<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/uncovered-tarp-docs-reveal-how-paulson-forced-banks-to-take-the-cash-2009-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/uncovered-tarp-docs-reveal-ho...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_trading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_trading</a><p>edit: typo and grammar",1416758633

It&#x27;s certainly not the model of an ideal protocol design or the correct way to design things from scratch.<p>I also think it is perfectly fine to have a reference implementation without a formal specification in many cases, and I don&#x27;t think specification-first necessarily leads to a better protocol. As you point out, CORBA is certainly horrible as well.<p>Just because no one has replaced dbus it isn&#x27;t good enough. The ever-appearing mantra of &quot;if you don&#x27;t like it, write your own&quot; is boring. It is perfectly reasonable to point out what is wrong with a protocol in wide(ning) use without immediately presenting a fully formed alternative. It could be that most people have more pressing concerns than individually fighting Red Hat and all the projects invested in dbus for control over Linux userspace.<p>There is no dichotomy here, the only choices are not silently accepting the protocols we have or &quot;paying a bunch of committee people&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re seriously proposing that anyone could just step in and redesign dbus from within the existing project structure at this point. Any changes would be fought tooth and nail by the people invested in it right now. Any replacement would necessarily be a completely separate project, and it would have extremely slim prospects of succeeding. It&#x27;s not surprising that people aren&#x27;t doing that, even though dbus is flawed.<p>We are stuck with a lot of terrible things. The only way any of them will be fixed is for enough people to get angry enough to do something about it.",1416758628

2465133,comment,2456730,2464843,1,0,trevelyan,,,"""Because printing more money is just another form of stealing.""<p>When the amount of gold in circulation falls, its value rises and people go dig up more. And yet your logic would make this a criminal act, because ""digging up gold is just another form of stealing"". You make the gold standard criminal by definition.<p>So I doubt you really mean what you are saying, and I have serious doubts you understand these issues since your rhetoric as well as your misunderstanding of what Keynes wrote basically echos the rhetoric of the Republican Party under Reagan and Bush, the two administrations which have done the most long-term damage to the US national budget, and whose anti-debt crusade (once out of power) has been largely responsible for keeping unemployment so high this long after the crisis.<p>What would Keynes have advocated in 2008? Unquestionably a more aggressive fiscal stimulus in 2008 once it became clear monetary policy had failed to prevent deflation and soaring unemployment. Your concerns about debt would be irrelevant because the cost of capital to the US government was zero: the world was (rightly or wrongly) clamoring to buy Treasury Bonds at non-existent rates of interest.<p>This approach becomes untenable once there is inflation or when competition for capital raises interest rates. But if the former happens then you've eliminated deflation and solved the unemployment problem. And if interest rates rise without triggering inflation? Then you use monetary policy to lower them and increase the money supply again through market mechanisms until deflation stops. Rinse and repeat until unemployment is close to its natural rate again and/or you get inflation, at which point you declare victory and go home. Radical? Considering that the total cost of the 2008 Economic Stimulus act was about 1/4 of the annual US military budget, it is hard to see pursuing full employment as an unreasonable policy, especially when the cost of doing so was effectively zero.",1303269949

2465126,comment,2464764,2465059,28,0,pstack,,,"The realization itself came to me when I was listening to Carl Sagan read from <i>Pale Blue Dot</i>. For an unseemingly long minute, it took the breath out of my body and when I finally drew it in again, the near obsessive voraciousness with which I attacked certain things (often to the detriment of my own well-being, in favor of some demented work-ethic) suddenly lifted. Just a bit at first. But enough.<p>The most dramatic impact is that I stopped letting a project I started in 1997 (when I was 20) continue to suck me dry, like a vampire. I ran it far after I'd entirely lost interest in it. Partially because I felt it was my one meaningful contribution to <i>anything</i>, so far. I started it in 1997 and did every piece of work involved in it from building the servers to writing all of the backend code and front-end presentation and dealing with users (it was an auction site with a niche sub-culture twist and a screw-eBay and their fees selling point). When you invest that much time (many thousands of hours) and money and emotion into a project, you feel an obligation to maintain it. When you know there are tens of thousands of regular users (100k, at the peak) depending on it for socializing and even their income in some cases, you feel obligated. And, like with bad relationships, the familiarity and all of that invested time obligates you.<p>For me, it got to the point where I wouldn't read my email anymore. I wouldn't post in my own forums. I wouldn't even visit my own site for months at a time. I would rely on a script to ensure the site was up and responding, because even just seeing the front page load filled me with anxiety and a degree of loathing. I ran this for twelve years. The last six of them almost entirely out of some misguided sense that I owed it to people. Or that I owed it to myself (that ceasing it would somehow waste all of my personal investment in it).<p>One day, I decided that was it. I had to cut the cord with the project and the community and everything that it ever meant. I published a grateful thank you and goodbye (sans the details about how I had come to loath everything about it) with a notice that I would terminate it in three months. And on that date, I simply pulled the plug.<p>I still have a workaholic mentality, where work is concerned. But at least my every waking moment outside of work isn't spent dealing with users or mediating conflicts between them or fixing bugs or feeling that I had to get around to re-writing the entire code-base all over again.

Instead, I can read a book, watch a movie, listen to music, play a videogame, or even just take a long nap.

Zen is traced back to Bodhidharma, who came from Southern India. Taoism certainly didn't come from India. Moreover, Zen's almost nihilistic austerity seems at odds with the back-to-nature lyricism of, say, the Tao te Ching. It is difficult to imagine Lao Tse beating disciples with sticks.",1303269756

2465113,comment,2464764,2464936,3,0,AngryParsley,,,"I didn't mean to start a debate about great artists in history. As a less emotionally-charged analogy, consider math. There are extremely well-known and respected mathematicians from centuries ago. That said, we have better tools today (both new forms of math and computer-assisted proofs) that let us solve more complicated problems than ever before. If the Newton had access to MATLAB or Mathematica, he probably would have done even greater things. Likewise, if Beethoven had GarageBand or a Tenori-on, he could have created even more interesting music.<p>There are a couple places where this analogy breaks down. Status matters a lot in art. Also, in math the end-product is the main thing that matters, while in art the creation process factors into its impressiveness. A sculpture hand-chiseled out of marble is more impressive than one made by a 3D printer, even if they are indistinguishable to human eyes.<p>Still, I dare say that if Bach created his works today, they would be appreciated about as much as other high-quality contemporary composers (such as Hans Zimmer).<p>Did I just compare artists across history?

In that time, I did plenty - specifically, I made a whole bunch of UIs that, for one reason or another, sucked.<p>In time, the more designs I made, the more I started to develop an intuition for things that worked or didn't work. Not to mention that before I learned how to design, I had to learn how to listen to my users - and before I could do that, I needed to learn to check my ego at the door and realize that even as the ""designer"", it didn't mean I knew a darn thing about what my design should look like until I talked to them (and sometimes, not designing what I originally ""wanted"" to design as a result). Yes, there are definitely skills involved in ""doing"" things that are hard to train, and there's a sense of ""natural"" talent - but with enough effort, even a computer science major like myself can pick up those skills.<p>And conversely, the hours you spend doing design are hours that are necessarily taken away from other things you want to be an expert on.

No distractions, and I can poll IMs instead of needing a context switch when someone drops by.  If I'm stuck on a problem I'll go for a walk, cook food, or take the laptop out to a coffee shop to work.  I enjoy the flexibility.<p>Downsides for me: I do miss some of the random office chatter -- finding out cool problems coworkers have solved and generally learning by osmosis.  And I have yet to find a great replacement for 3-4 people standing at a wall of whiteboards.  IMs, skype and meeting highlights solve some problems.  Our group is 2/3 remote spanning 8 time zones, so we're used to working a bit harder on communication.<p>As for social factors, it was hard at first.  I'd find myself not leaving the apartment for weeks, which was less than good...  I'm making an effort to get out of the house daily, whether hitting the gym, buying groceries, or just strolling around.  This is getting easier, especially as spring seems to finally be hitting Boston.<p>The biggest non-technical advantage for me is not needing a car.  I detested commuting.  Instead of spending an extra hour or two driving I can take breaks (or even naps) in the day and have the same ""door-to-door"" time.  Financially, it's also a winner.  I don't even know how much gas costs here.  There are 4 zipcars within a few blocks if I need them.<p>Work-life separation is trickier.

4701163,comment,4700485,4701140,1,0,fusiongyro,,,"I mean it in a couple of ways. Personally, it was too expensive to build because I simply couldn't see spending the time to do it. Part of that (for me) was that it was 2006 and I just didn't know what technology I'd need to invent or find that would do it. There was mod_pubsub and BOSH, and both were kind of a pain, and that's obviously not what they're planning on using.<p>The second way is just the perennial question of how is it going to pay the bills. Amateur writers does that sound like a demographic where everybody has an extra $5/month for your service? Could be, but I'm not quite naive enough to try it and find out. I'm not really a ""startup guy"" though (I'm here for the articles and the conversation), some people who are less risk-averse seem tempted to try; maybe they'll get rich, it's impossible to predict.<p>Actually your experience illustrates perfectly what I might mean by too expensive to build, don't you think? You and one guy on the side and you couldn't keep upyou may be tempted to find a scapegoat in yourself, your team or your code but frankly nearly every project needs more developers and more time. This is your hobby now, so you know that you can lavish a couple hours a week on something indefinitely, but you've probably also noticed that boring bug fixes are hard to get motivated to do when you only have an hour left in the day and want to do something fun.<p>Anyway, kudos to you for learning to code, and I'm sorry to hear your project withered. Sounds to me like you did the right thing here.",1351234512

Fundamentally file systems are _hard_.  It has to handle a huge amount of concurrent operations, and users want speed, so we use fine-grained locking, and there's a reason why file systems take 100 man years or so to become production ready.  The btrfs folks started in 2007, and I warned them it would probably be at least 5-7 years, minimum before it would be ready for the enterprise.   And now here it is five years later, and the community distributions (not the enterprise distros) are just starting to adopt btrfs.   ZFS took seven years to develop before Sun announced it, and then it took a few more years before people trusted it on production servers.<p>No one believes how hard it is when they start, but the history is pretty clear.",1351234407

4701140,comment,4700485,4701116,1,0,neoveller,,,"What do you mean exactly by ""too expensive to build""? I taught myself how to code a year ago, and I managed to build a pretty complete platform in a month.<p>To put this in some other perspective as well, I started a similar startup Neovella two years ago, before I knew how to code. It was entirely the collaborative writing side of things--no reader feedback or anything. The community grew pretty well, and we published 4 anthologies of short stories from it. The experience was awesome and unexpectedly amusing. My engineering team (1 man with a full-time job, working for free) couldn't keep up with bug fixes and features requests, and so it kind of withered away and died... but Neovella still receives users to this day who hope to find something other than a ghost town so they can continue to write in a community. I sent out an email to my former users telling them about PenFM, and the feedback overwhelmed me. People loved the product and were entirely supportive, and replied as such, even if they didn't have the means to donate anything. That's more of why I'm doing it. Also because I'm finally able to code it up all on my own, and not let down my user-base anymore.",1351233878

I'm impressed that this is still the situation a year after iCloud's release. When iCloud was originally announced, we were faced with the decision to adopt it or continue with our own server-based syncing solution.<p>I'm glad we stayed with our own approach, as iCloud + Core Data has never reached the level of stability for me to be comfortable deploying it. By now it's a moot point though, since we now have an Android version to sync against, which eliminates iCloud as a solution entirely.",1351232866

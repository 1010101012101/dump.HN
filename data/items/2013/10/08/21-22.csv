A few little safety precautions can ensure that everyone has a fabulous time. Follow the law, no one under 16 drives the Vail snowmobile rental and no one under 6 is a passenger. Check the weather and avalanche reports as well as trail conditions. Make sure everyone is dressed properly for the elements and that you can recognize hypothermia and frostbite and know how to respond.<p>Be sure to bring along a safety kit for your Vail snowmobile rental that includes extra belts and spark plugs; add a first aid kit and youre ready to hit the Colorado snowmobiling trails. Remember to travel at safe speeds to avoid throwing off young lightweight passengers. Stick to the trails and make sure you have working lights and a snowmobile flag. Now, add fun and stir!",1381269592

You should always test it&#x27;s validity given the market at that moment in time or in the foreseeable future. That said, if you are Twitter, you are affecting fundamental changes in communication and your impact is evident on the societal level. At that level of impact, you have the luxury and duty to take time to really work out the kinks from your business model.<p>Now, if you are not Twitter, raising money during a bubble or looser years and using it wisely could be the difference between life or death (or layoffs) during not so good years.<p>Having money in the bank is powerful, whether you are putting it there or your investors are.

Snowden was also able to get journalists to use OTR, without relying on some web interface with questionable security claims.  The problem with PGP and S/MIME is that the existing software is too hard to set up.  It is hard to tell journalists to go use Thunderbird, get Enigmail set up, and publish a key.  The situation is even worse with S/MIME, despite the built-in support in many email clients.<p>Basically, the problem is that PGP and S/MIME as they exist today are (and I shudder to say it) too security conscious.  The reality is that most users are not going to take the time to maintain their public keys, to verify others&#x27; public keys, etc., nor are most users going to spend the time to get their keys verified by a CA.  We need a &quot;lite&quot; PGP client that is less obnoxious about using untrusted keys, and basically a &quot;newbie&quot; PGP that is more vulnerable to active MITM attacks (which are actually much harder to pull off than one might expect).  It would also be nice if public keys could be easily published via QR codes, so that someone can literally hand their public key to another person.<p>The <i>worst</i> thing we can do is lie to people about the security they receive e.g. telling them things like &quot;Lavabit is set up so that nobody but you can read your email!&quot;",1381269423

6518083,comment,6514843,6515804,2,0,sauce,,,"> Please explain what exactly musicians need significant investment money for? Studio time is a small fraction of what it used to be and simply practicing as a band is really cheap.<p>How about rent? Also food, gas money to get to shows, merchandise (t-shirts/posters/hoodies/whatever), CDs (yes, you do still need to have these.. telling someone at a show who saw you for the first time ever and wants to hear more to &quot;go look us up on facebook/soundcloud/twitter&quot; isn&#x27;t gonna cut it), gear (and gear repairs), advertising (including things like printing flyers out to promote shows), etc. Stepping it up a bit, if you&#x27;re serious about touring, you&#x27;ll need to bring additional crew besides the band itself, such as sound/lighting/merch people, roadies, etc. all of whom need to be paid, fed, and transported.<p>Even being able to practice as a band can get pretty expensive, if you consider that many neighborhoods/cities have really strict noise ordinance laws these days. So if you&#x27;re trying to start even a moderately loud rock band, your options are a) try to practice in someone&#x27;s house/garage and risk having to deal with $350+ noise violations on a weekly basis every time one of the neighbors gets cranky, or b) rent a practice space somewhere, which most places I know of start at $400/month upwards. Also note that in smaller towns where there isn&#x27;t an abundance of unused commercial property, these spaces are either non-existent or have waitlists over a year and a half long.<p>Most musicians/bands out there don&#x27;t have label support and get by paying for these things out of pocket (to a point, most bands are seriously skimping in one or more of these areas because they simply don&#x27;t have the money or the manpower to make it happen). Not saying its impossible, but it certainly is extremely difficult to make it to the level of world-class musicians when the majority of your productive hours have to be spent in an unrelated field for the sole purpose of paying the bills.",1381269359

Sure, you might be better off saving to cover predictable small losses to one crop from a bad winter every few years, but it&#x27;s probably practical to cover the one in 30 year drought that kills everything.

It didn&#x27;t require a degree, but it certainly required skill.   I would actually compare working in manufacturing during that &#x27;golden age&#x27;  to working in the computer industry, now;  It was a new industry, and demand was so high that they didn&#x27;t have the option of requiring a college education.<p>(I mean, I think you require different base attributes to write CRUD apps vs. be a machinist;  but still, being a machinist took a significant amount of skill.  And just like in the computer industry, yeah, there were jobs that most people, once adequately trained, could do.  There were other jobs, just like the computer industry, which required attributes only present in a small portion of the population.)<p>That was part of why I went into my own story in my post;   when demand for labor is really high (as it was in the computer industry in the late &#x27;90s)  it makes sense for companies to hire and train;  Not everyone is going to make it through the training process, and those that do are going to be able to demand a higher wage.<p>I am arguing that the problem now is not a lack of good-paying unskilled labor, but an overall lack of demand for labor. (Some would argue that this is instead an oversupply of labor;  we&#x27;ve got a larger percentage of our population that expects to work outside the home for decent wages now than we did then.  Personally, I would not feel okay taking that position.)<p>That was part of why I went into my own story in my post;   when demand for labor is really high (as it was in the computer industry win the late &#x27;90s)  it makes sense for companies to hire and train.  When demand for labor is low compared to the number of folks who can do the job, well, you might as well take someone proven.<p>>It would be fascinating to watch pg discuss this with Michael Moore, because Moore seems to feel entitled to something being sustained that pg seems to argue was clearly unsustainable.<p>Eh, &#x27;entitled&#x27;   is... kinda putting a negative slant on it.   (I mean, I think it does describe Moore&#x27;s emotional approach to the problem, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s /useful/)     I think that most all of us would benefit from a higher demand for our own labor (as most of us make most of our money from labor, rather than from rented labor)<p>I mean, as folks in a growing, high-demand industry, we&#x27;re further up the labor food chain, and you could say we have an interest in maintaining a wage differential, but the massive levels of unemployment are good for... very few of us.",1381268404

Even if you have no insider knowledge, there is overwhelming evidence of a highly sophisticated, safe, abundant and financially diverse industry. Shoot, all we need to look at is purity and availability rates of narcotics to conclude that there must be more production and distribution than the handful of super massive manufacturing facilities that we associate with major cartels. The murder rate <i>in totality</i> is not high enough to associate a necessary massive physical risk with involvement in the drug trade. Even if SR was 10 times as large as they were, they would still be a small fraction of the overall drug marketplace.<p>The second thing to keep in mind is that the drug trade is inherently tied to the physical manufacturing and trading of product.

6517986,comment,6515557,6515557,1,0,cryofan,,,"due process was simply a tool that was born out of the civil rights era, a tool used by the upper class to increase the labor supply and thereby drop wages and decrease voter unity. Due process was a result of race-guilt engendered in the brains of educated young men who attended elite schools in the first half of the 20th century. The curriculum at those schools was molded by monies from large nonprofit foundations, e.g., getty, ford and rockefeller foundations. These foundations were run by the upper class. The upper class has a primary goal: increase profits. One way they do this is dropping wages. You lower wages by increasing supply of labor faster than demand for it increases. The upper class created a civil rights movement by creating race-guilt, race shame in the minds of impressionable young white people in school. The monies from the foundations were paid to race-oriented, anti-white scholars, activists and writers. Over the decades these well paid faux-leftists managed to mold,shape and change the american left from a left oriented on populist economics, class economics to one oriented about race and gender, identity politics, a new Left that taught that in order for educated whites to prove themselves as non-racist, to make up, atone for the crimes of slavery, they had to elevate the nonwhites, put them ahead of working class whites, to make a place for them in white society. Due process was a concept that arose to help the upper class help the nonwhites get ahead. And in the process, the upper class increased the labor supply and dropped wages and made themselves richer. Just a coincidence of course.<p>Now, you realize that it was never whites who were slaveowners. It was the upper class all along. The 1860 census showed that only 1.5 percent of all white americans owned slaves. And no surprise that it was the rich, seeing that a slave cost several years income.<p>Now, seeing as how my karma is so low here because I speak against the upper, this comment will be duplicated on my blog at radicalamericancentrist on blogspot.",1381268096

6517969,comment,6517363,6517363,22,0,car,,,"The onus for taking back empties should be on the individual stores that sold them. So basically a change in law.<p>In Europe customers can return their own empties when they go shopping, by dropping the bottles into fully automated machines that dispenses the refund. So they get to benefit, and the problem is distributed.<p>In California, in my experience, the scarcity and sheer nastiness of return centers keeps most individual consumer from returns.<p>My one time attempt of returning empties in California took three trips to the distant and frequently unmanned center, and finally yielded a voucher only valid in the supermarket on which&#x27;s premises the center was located. No thanks.<p>Edit: After my post I found this gem in the comments, enough said!:<p><i>A Functioning CRV System<p>These dynamics are fascinating to me because I&#x27;ve lived in both San Francisco and Michigan. Michigan is one of the states with the highest redemption values for cans at 10 each, plus the cost of living (and thus salaries) are much lower than in San Francisco, so each can returned makes a much bigger impact on everyone&#x27;s finances. The result was EVERYONE returned their own cans, every family from the lower class to the wealthier ones has a trash can in the kitchen and &quot;a place where they put cans&quot;.<p>It was shocking to me when I moved out to California and nobody saved their cans - the culture in Michigan is that throwing away cans is like throwing away money. Then I realized why after I tried to return a bag full - in Michigan, almost every major grocery store has machines that process can returns - completely self service, at almost every grocery store. The grocery stores use it to get customers in the store, and recycling is organized and incented. In California, when I tried to return that first bag, I had to go to a recycling center that was nowhere close to where I lived and in the middle of nowhere. I waited inline behind 20 or so homeless people, and the facility was filthy. In Michigan, the machines counted every individual can and gave you a receipt readout with precisely how many cans, glass bottles, and plastic bottles you turned in. In California, they sloppily weighed your bag and handed you cash. It was way more difficult to turn in the cans and it was less accurate and half the value per can. The whole system felt like a rip off & waste of time.<p>The crazy thing is what people perceive the point of the can redemption system to be. In Michigan, everybody gets that its supposed to get people to recycle, and it clearly works. Its like an easy way to save a little spending money or get some cash off your grocery bill every couple weeks. In California, a lot of the people I talked to about it thought it was a program to help the homeless, because they were so used to the trashcan foraging activity. I don&#x27;t know how to respond to the idea of closing recycling centers, but having lived in Michigan where the can redemption system is functioning, it feels like keeping recycling centers open to help homeless people have an income is masking the harder problem, which is what do we do to help these people get work and stop relying on entrepreneurial trash collection as a living?</i>",1381267768

I am a self taught python programmer, and had plenty of different jobs as side projects. Chance got me involved with the startup world and gave me some steep learning curve in the field with two failed projects (gastronomy point of sales system, luxury goods marketing and distribution company) in Berlin, Germany.<p>Unfortunately, getting in touch with the right people is the biggest problem: It is hard to assemble the right team in Germany, as most graduates with technical skills make a run for the large companies of the well paying industrial sector. Also, the city of Berlin, the so called &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; of Germany, is not the super shiny place it seems. There is a lot going on there in terms of startups, but it is mostly on-line marketing/sales/media/advertisement, a territory discovered long ago.<p>I am not afraid to get my hands dirty and &quot;wet&quot; - on the contrary, I love science, and love the stuff companies like mc10 inc do. However, I am well aware of the advantages of IT based products over chem/bio/medical products when it comes to development, risk and initial investment.<p>I can think, work hard, communicate, I love technology. So, where do I have to go to get the maximum exposure and build a good startup raft? Is the Valley something for me? Shall I buy a ticket and just fly there, like I did it with Berlin? Is there any place in Europe that could be compared to it?<p>I would be grateful for any directions, contacts, hubs etc, that could speed up my search.<p>Regards,<p><pre><code>  piotr\n\n  pioja at gmx dot net</code></pre>",1381267713

They got a court order. He said no. At some-point he was willing to cooperate, but by that point, they didn&#x27;t care because they thought he was jerking them around.They then requested the SSL keys. This article is more clear about the exact sequence of events[0], but the the posted one says so as well. The initial request was not for the SSL keys.<p>From the newyorker article :\n&quot;On June 10th, the government secured an order from the Eastern District of Virginia. The order, issued under the Stored Communications Act, required Lavabit to turn over to the F.B.I. retrospective information about one account, widely presumed to be that of Snowden. (The name of the target remains redacted, and Levison could not divulge it.) The order directed Lavabit to surrender names and addresses, Internet Protocol and Media Access Control addresses, the volume of each and every data transfer, the duration of every session, and the source and destination of all communications associated with the account. It also forbade Levison and Lavabit from discussing the matter with anyone.\n&quot;<p>Sometime after his initial refusal and then offer to comply with some caveats that the fed&#x27;s interpreted as stalling:<p>&quot;Prior to the hearing on July 16th, the U.S. Attorney filed a motion for civil contempt, requesting that Levison be fined a thousand dollars for every day that he refused to comply with the pen-register order. EARLIER IN THE DAY, Hilton issued a search-and-seizure warrant, authorizing law enforcement to seize from Lavabit all information necessary to decrypt communications sent to or from [the account], including encryption keys and SSL keys, and all information necessary to decrypt data stored in or otherwise associated with [the account].

Their account reps are constantly raving about mobile ads with Facebook, and in our limited tests, they haven&#x27;t been over-promising.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t be a bad strategy to base a significant amount of predictions about the larger mobile market on decisions made by Facebook, since they have the best data on it.<p>As far as game developers, the SEM for SEO strategy is the TapJoy model and it sucks for people who play.  One thing I think deep linking could start to do for developers is allow them to cannibalize each other (say Angry Birds started advertising in Candy Crush Saga to people who spent over $X/week and had Angry Birds installed, I know this probably isn&#x27;t the best example, but it is descriptive at least).

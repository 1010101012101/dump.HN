We have the very specific skils, attitudes, and patience required to buy a domain name, rent a VPS or dedicated server and configure SSH public keys, Postfix/Courier, DNS, SPF, DKIM, and keep it up to date and patched, audit it to make sure it stays secure, and detect/respond to intrusions.

4035115,comment,4032949,4033221,1,0,shanecleveland,,,"Agreed. Context-dependent is an important distinction for this rule. Coming from a manufacturing-based business of mostly customized products, if all of our customers were always ""right,"" then we would be loosing a losing a lot of money on replacing/refunding products to customers who ordered wrong, used the product incorrectly or are just trying to deceive us (which is rare). A good approach, in my opinion, is to not make the customer think they are wrong and find a way to amicably resolve the situation. My initial response is to gather more information and say ""let's see what we can do to make this work for you."" We find it is a good opportunity to show how accommodating we are, even when the customer is wrong, which can make a reoccurring customer out of them and educate them for future orders.<p>I am sure there are some types of business that would rather take the customer-is-right approach, which may be easier and less costly. And there are also probably times when letting certain customers take their business elsewhere may actually be best.",1338242716

I said that you should not optimize for writing math, you should optimize for reading math.<p><i>My</i> point is that these goals are nearly one in the same when you get to the high level. Many mathematical relationships are very complex, usually not the step-by-step procedures that is common in code. Thus being able to hold the entire relationship in your head at once is crucial. Single letter names for variables and functions are critical here (for the previously mentioned reason working-memory-decay).<p>I basically have a bachelors in math, and I could not imagine reading complex equations with full variable names. The hard part is understanding the whole, not remembering what x or i means. If you find an equation cryptic, that just means you don't have the requisite knowledge to really understand it.",1338242642

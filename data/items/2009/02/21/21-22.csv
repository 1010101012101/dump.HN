Google stock price should be safer because the cash on hand will provide a lower bound on the value of the company and so a large margin account is feasible. In fact, if you borrow exactly the amount that Google would have paid and invest it you can synthesize whatever cash holdings level you think Google should have based on your risk preferences and the rest of your portfolio.<p>This is roughly an application of the Modigliani Miller capital structure irrelevance theorem for the further interested.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani-Miller_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani-Miller_theorem</a>",1235253537

490110,comment,489827,490061,0,0,russell,,,"Excellent exposition of what I was trying to say.<p>The overarching concept is the """"expressiveness"" of a language.  Concept is ""How easily can I express my goal in the language. A crude measure of the relative expressiveness of two languages is the ratio of the number of tokens in the respective implementations of a program.  I remember reading a study a decade ago that ranked C at 1, Java at 2, Python at 5 (roughly).  Having hashes and their literals as part of the language makes it more expressive than one where hash is in a library.  Look at JavaScript where the literals for arrays are used as a serialization protocol.<p>Expressiveness goes beyond just literals.  In python functions are first class objects, so there is no need for the thunk/functor/inner class kludge that you have in Java.  Or look at list comprehensions which are way more powerful than for each.<p>The expressiveness shapes how programs are coded.  Programmers will use a concise, powerful idiom because it saves time and thinking and the program is shorter.  There is a corresponding obligation on the language developer to make sure the expressive idiom is almost always the best way to go.",1235253446

490107,comment,489888,489888,0,0,pixelmonkey,,,"The visualization mentions credit default swaps, but then doesn't show how those, too, contributed to the cycle as all the investments were being unwound.  My somewhat primitive understanding is that since the 'safe' tranche of the CDOs was 'insured' via a CDS, when the defaults actually happened, the banks had to pay back not only the amount they had borrowed, but also an additional CDS payout.  This contributed to the bankruptcies too, I think.",1235253088
490106,comment,489923,490037,0,0,triplefox,,,"Indeed. Patterns are what you use when there is no cleaner option for the situation.<p>Recently I've been writing some code which is surprisingly amenable to a cut+paste approach: A tool which automatically generates level layouts for a game. At first I endeavored towards a data-driven approach to customizing each type of level I wanted to make, but soon I decided, ""There are only six types of levels. Each one has different requirements and they get maintained in isolation. There is no point in trying to reconcile all of them at once.""<p>And so I went ahead with a strategy of reuse for the most common elements - low-level generation strategies - and made big switch statements for the remainder. It works, I get the job done, and there's almost never anything surprising. The only time something did surprise me was when I accidentally pasted the same code twice in different places and threw the results askew in a non-obvious way. That flags some need to slim down bloated methods, but even as-is, it still feels pretty slim at ~2500 lines.",1235252979

3113112,comment,3111133,3111731,5,0,tel,,,"Apologies for the vagueness there. Also apologies for the lack of structure following. I don't have time to write an essay, so I hope you can settle for some meandering commentary.<p>While the more complex topologies, activation functions, training algorithms are interesting, the current workhorse of ANNs are still plain MLPs (to my knowledge). So, yeah, I was referring mostly to MLPs.<p>The argument I'm doing a pale job voicing is the one that exists between the statistics and ML communities. For those unfamiliar, stat people generally demand comprehensible, general statements about the performance and meaning of the various techniques. This has historically largely restricted the power of statistical techniques. Advances in computing expanded in the ML field because people aimed to solve simpler goals (maximize training and testing predictive accuracy, ignoring why or how it works). This was a major force in the current renaissance in learning technologies, but leaves a big divided camp.<p>One side demands theory, story, and proof. The other just demands results. Which is great. They complement each other.<p>---<p>ANNs (MLPs in particular) bother me because they're essentially general non-linear discrimination boundary learners. Once you have that decision boundary you can (with the usual enormous concerns toward overfitting) predict new data with arbitrary accuracy given enough compute power, large enough layers, and enough training data. But even with all of those things you won't learn much from your parameter space.<p>Compare this to, for instance, LDA. It's hard to be certain that the usual high-level interpretation of LDA in data mining (that it finds mixtures of topics on documents) is terribly meaningful, but you still are able to learn a lot about the data space by examining the topic space. It's the kind of thing that allows for many interaction points between the algorithm and the users.<p>MLPs of course will also induce a latent representation on the hidden layer. There are really fascinating implementations of non-linear PCA that take this approach, but it's not clear to me what the properties of this latent representation are or how to influence them.<p>---<p>In some sense, the heart of my argument comes from how flexibility can hurt you in a learning algorithm: it makes your parameter space less meaningful (though I imagine mutable topologies can help this a lot  I have a little experience doing grid search over recurrent nodes and attempting to rank signals by their temporal information using the resultant best-performing topology and I'm sure that rabbit hole goes far deeper).<p>I'm not looking to be awed by a rule based system or GAI (whatever the hell that even means). I want  hypothesis spaces which allow you to flexibly describe a question about a large class of data and then learn things from the optimum. I also want these algorithms to solve real world problems. Bayesian modeling gives you a lot of the first one. MLPs give you a lot of the second.",1318629538

The article starts with the assertion that it has begun and moves on from there. I guess more than anything, the article is a call for action. I wanted the discussion to start and it did.<p>If I can present my chain of thoughts leading up to my decision in an interesting way I may write another article called ""Why I think Siri is the Next Big Thing"".<p>But here is my chain of thought for the curious mind in a very crude way:<p>What I did was to observe the moves of Apple and try to figure out their strategy. I put together the information that is available on the Internet. I connected the dots.<p>I knew Apple bought Siri for about $200 mil. I knew about Siri's history. You don't buy voice recognition software for this price. I watched the Mossberg-Jobs interview where Mossberg keeps insisting that Siri is in the search area and Jobs keep correcting him saying no Siri is in the A.I. area. I watched how the critical question ""What are you going to do with it?"" got lost during the conversation. When Mossberg said that the iPad is great for consumption but not for creation, it was very clear that Jobs did not see it like that at all. I also watched some Apple videos from late 80's which depicts a professor talking to his computer and getting his daily business done. It seemed to me that they had this vision all along and now they were implementing it.<p>Then I realized how iCloud fits in to this all. With the introduction of Siri it was clear to me that the next frontier the competition is moving to is A.I. Apple is going all in. IBM is pushing hard. Apparently, Google is baking some stuff.<p>While I was thinking about all these and trying to find its meaning, the interview between Fred Wilson and Carlota Perez helped me to put it all in context.<p>I think this is the time to invest in A.I. If a VC expects huge returns from his investment in 5-7 years, I think A.I. is the right way to go. If an entrepreneur wants to do something amazing, I think A.I. is the right way to go. My speculation is in 1-2 years this is going to be all we talk about.<p>I think A.I. is where the puck is going now. I might be wrong, I might be right. We will know soon enough.",1318628026

Because webOS has a consistent interface for handling multiple pages (and WebOS 2+ has card grouping), it makes for less mental effort to expect that is going to happen.<p>Holding down the home button is as fast as scrolling through cards in my experience. You're right, that is a comparable interface for going back and forth between applications.

The system is broken, that does not mean that the system should be abolished. Granted there is a high level of student debt:<p><a href=""http://projectonstudentdebt.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projectonstudentdebt.org/</a><p>But that does not mean that education in and of itself structured in curricula and colleges is actually a bad thing. Even with subsidies, education is quite a huge financial challenge for most people. And increasing privatisation of education will only lead to more student debt, almost to the point where the opportunity cost is too high to go to college. That is fine for the genius 1-2% of the USA but for the rest of the US the structure does not really create knowledge based human capital so needed to be competitive in the current global landscape<p>The financing of education brings about a core philosophical issue, which is, is education a public or private good. In most European countries, it is considered a public good, and as such the state's responsibility. As such student debt issues are almost marginal in these countries. However, on the other hand, education and research quality in these universities is really low, as evidenced by rankings:<p><a href=""http://www.arwu.org/ARWU2010.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arwu.org/ARWU2010.jsp</a><p>(I know rankings are debatable but this is the only worldwide global ranking system so lets just use it as a proxy for approximating how good a university is). I also know that due to huge amounts of student loans subsidized through private lenders, the whole education financial system came to an absolute halt in 2008, whereby lenders could not lend to eligible students to go to college. This is due to the fact that education loans are also packaged into securities and sold to investors. They are also some of the highest performing loans. The US government mainly guarantees these loans, but in 2008 had to actually inject money to get loan market flowing again.<p>So the question is, is the university just a place to teach, or somewhere we advance humanity through sometimes isoteric research that may become relevant 20 years from now. The US system has betted on the latter of these two options for the past 30 years or so. The University system in the US is more of a business than a place of education. The increased privitisation of education has thus lead us to this place. Does it make sense to privatise it more given the current situation? In my opinion, probably not.<p>As for people calling for the Khan Academy Model, please look at what they are doing recently: they have partnered up with the Los Altos School district to integrate their platform in classes. That increases the use of tech in education, but it does not necessarily entirely change the way education is imbibed to children. Same with Knewton, which works with universities.",1318627831

3112998,comment,3112749,3112749,15,0,byrneseyeview,,,"This is just silly. I started reading this article with a couple biases in mind: I can't ever remember reading anything by Wadhwa and thinking anything other than ""That is the conventional wisdom, yes,"" and Thiel is correct that college is a bubble (<a href=""http://www.byrnehobart.com/blog/higher-education-the-next-big-bad-bubble/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.byrnehobart.com/blog/higher-education-the-next-bi...</a>)<p>But Wadhwa's advice is just ludicrous. If it's 2005, and you claim that housing is a bubble, the proper response isn't ""Go put your money where your mouth is: start manufacturing mobile homes, or tents, or something."" It's a non-sequitur: people are overpaying for education <i>because they treat it as an asset</i>: if you double the sticker price, buyers react by assuming that they're buying twice as much of it.<p>The right responses to a bubble: short it, or at least structure your life so you're not dependent on it. In real estate, that means renting rather than buying; in higher ed, that means dropping out and investing your efforts into tasks that better measure your underlying talents, and don't cost tens of thousands of dollars.<p>It's just a weird defense of the status quo: nowhere does Wadhwa ask questions like: have we overestimated how many people should go to college? Are we even willing to tell people that they'd be happier (and society would be better off) if they became electricians or plumbers? It seems like Thiel's framework is flexible enough to imagine a country where 50% of the population earns a masters, or where only 5% pursue a BA. Whereas Wadhwa's framework is robust enough to imagine a swing of half a standard deviation away from whatever the status quo is.<p><i>Full disclosure: it's a little early to tell, but I'm fairly successful; I dropped out of college my freshman year.</i>",1318627177

My reaction in this context, however, is that I do not feel like Google is trying to figure out a business model of any kind for most of its products.<p>To try to draw the difference, in the case of where Google offers free things, it seems to not have any relation at all to the things where it makes money: I don't think that by offering Google Code Search they got more people using Gmail or Google Search (things they monetize).<p>The best idea I've seen so far is that by doing large numbers of totally random fun/free things ""for the world"", users will always see them as ""not evil"", even though their core business model (aggregate information on users and use it to drive targeted advertisements) is the same as that of companies like DoubleClick (generally considered ""evil"").<p>(Which I found to be a hilariously awesome notion: that Google's random projects /are/ ""freemium"" in a sense, but where the upsell is more just a general notion of trying to dampen an overall negative connotation. As Google shuts down side projects, and concentrates on more controversial things like Google+, it will be interesting to see if they manage to maintain their ""people don't think we are evil"" status.)<p>(To try to be very clear: I do not consider advertising to be intrinsically evil, and am even sometimes involved in that space: do not take that previous comments to be indicative of a reaction I personally am having to their business models. Lots of people hated DoubleClick, lots of people seem to hate most ad companies, and yet people generally like Google: I think trying to analyze why is very interesting.)<p>...<p>Now, that aside, I think that there is still a bug (but find this to me more on the philosophical side): you can also view the freemium business model as a ""tax"" (subsidizing a general service by taking a cut of another area), and whether that tax makes sense or not becomes tricky. In the case of GitHub, their pricing for people who want private repositories is brutal, and those people are subsidizing the ecosystem of free projects that are using GitHub to host their code.<p>This, however, is not actually ""sustainable"": people on HN constantly complain about the cost of using GitHub for private repositories, and lament that there isn't something at GitHub's level competing with them that they can switch to, which won't cost them hundreds of dollars a month for what amounts to ""almost no disk space or usage"" (as GitHub bills per repository).<p>The problem here is that if you have a large free service that you are using to bootstrap your paid service, the paid service is in danger of being attacked, and being attacked hard: if nothing else, people who are offering the paid service competing with you aren't distracted by the free service (I am brutally aware of this bug, as my actual business has this problem; it is a little better for me, though: my market position is more similar to if GitHub also was the company that primarily developed git itself).<p>So, last week, BitBucket announced git support, and has what many people here consider to be reasonable pricing. I am now very curious how long it will take before people currently paying GitHub take strong enough notice (maybe requiring upgrades to BitBucket, delaying the process further), and start to switch.<p>When this happens, GitHub is no longer going to be able to extract the tax it currently extracts, and is going to be in the interesting position of having a large number of free users it is trying to support: people who now consider social version control to be something that is intrinsically free, and which large amounts of the open source ecosystem now rely on.<p>If that happens, it will be quite interesting to see how it goes down, and who gets effected in the market and ecosystem implosion that results.",1318626291

Or, do you want a %age of future royalties of the sale (that might tricky if they want to incorporate it into a bigger product). (Or a combination of both cash/stock and %age)<p>Do you want to remain involved in the project, or even moved into the team that would continue to work on this?  If so you should get that contractually agreed as part of the sale.<p>How much do you feel the project is work, and separately, how much has the company indicated they are willing to spend?  If it is more than, say, $20k I would go and see a lawyer to draw up the contractual issues.  Less then $20k, you can probably do this on your own given the amount is small.  You could also incentivize the lawyer to negotiate on your behalf in return for a %age of the sale - particularly worthwhile if you are not a good negotiator.  It's also a 3rd party, so none of the mind games that could be used against you by negotiating with your own boss/boss's boss/etc comes into play.<p>You might be wise to incorporate the project into a company, transfer the IP to the company and then sell them the company.<p>You should also review your code to make sure you are not using any OS code that has an incompatible license with selling the code.<p>Perhaps you could provide more answers and people could advise you better.",1318626277

The reason Hulu wasn't acquired even though many companies considered it, was because the CONTENT producers (who also happen to currently own Hulu) planned on increasing their prices to anyone who was dumb enough to buy Hulu without long term costs locked in contractually.<p>With this move, Google is moving to consolidate distribution as well as content production into Youtube.  The significance of this can't be underestimated.  If YouTube can produce a hit show, there's no middle man to step in and charge them arbitrary licensing fees to host the show.<p>I don't see any reason why youtube couldn't produce a show like MythBusters or the Jersey Shore.  And in a few years, maybe even a show like Breaking Bad.<p>Once this ball get's rolling traditional cable will be in for a rough ride.",1318626180

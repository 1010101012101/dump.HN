The mechanisms by which liquidity in the markets affect the end results are absolutely key to how your algorithm&#x27;s interactions with the data will pan out.

5976261,comment,5973896,5976233,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"My suspicion about why this is a big deal, at least from the administration&#x27;s standpoint as a very calculated move, is to make Snowden toxic--without the passport, wherever Snowden is currently situated is a place from which he cannot easily move, instantly making him a legal and political liability. Add to that the difficult place it forces the host nation in to be grilled on why they&#x27;re not taking action against an alleged lawbreaker who is within their sphere of influence. If he is going to be able to move, a country is going to have to muster the courage to stand before the world stage and make it known that they are helping.<p>It appeared for a moment that country was Ecuador. Now, apparently not (and quite possibly because of the publication of the alleged travel documents).",1372748720

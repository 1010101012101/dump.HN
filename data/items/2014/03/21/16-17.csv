7443343,comment,7436401,7436967,2,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>a) try your new code by saving in your editor, and hitting reload in your web browser.</i><p>The only language for which that works is client-side Javascript. For PHP, you forgot the part in which you have to install and run a web server, then point your browser to localhost. Plus, to get anything useful done, you&#x27;ll also need some sort of database to go along with it. I remember the first time I did that and it was pretty intimidating.<p>> <i>c) it&#x27;s not super high overhead at runtime ... it&#x27;s not too hard to get your page out with about 10 ms of overhead beyond data fetching</i><p>To me much more interesting is the total time it took for the client to receive the response, possibly when multiple concurrent requests are happening. The comparison here should be versus a static page served by Nginx of course.<p>The best throughput possible that I got for an otherwise complex business logic happened on the JVM. I basically rewrote a web-service built on top of Django/Python, with a redesign with emphasis towards in-memory caching, parallelism and async I/O and the result was a server that was able to process more than 10,000 requests per second with an average of about 5ms per request (actually in production the instances ended up processing about 2000 reqs/sec of real traffic, since c1.medium EC2 instances don&#x27;t have enough CPU power).<p>Of course, people that just need to slap something together, don&#x27;t need this level of throughput. If a request takes 400ms for a dumb web form on a low traffic website, that&#x27;s of no consequence to most people. The problem happens of course when such a piece of software evolves to something much bigger, like Wordpress. I&#x27;m always amazed at the gimmicks that people do just to keep their Wordpress powered blog alive.",1395420971

Now, you can increase the probability (e.g. shielding the merchant&#x27;s node from your double spend) of success but it&#x27;s not a sure bet. And the higher the node connectivity of the network (i.e. how many nodes are each node connected to) the harder this attack becomes.<p>There has been some work in this area, especially in pursuit of the efficacy of double spend attacks in light of some minor changes to the protocol which (I think) were rolled into core with the most release 0.9.0.[2] It&#x27;s about .09% probability of success.<p>[0]<a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#The_Finney_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#The_Finney_attack</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/49318d3f56c1d525aabf7fda78b23fc0/P2P2013_041.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/49318d3f56c1d525aabf7fda78b23...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/848064fa2e80f88a57aef43d7d5956c6/P2P2013_093.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/848064fa2e80f88a57aef43d7d595...</a>",1395420638

It&#x27;s more like, certain very specific markets (such as ISPs and desktop operating systems, apparently) have built-in dynamics that lead to natural monopolies. Most markets aren&#x27;t like this and can remain competitive without regulation.<p>My desktop OS example requires some clarification- there were plenty of things Microsoft did in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s where they exploited their position in the market to increase market share. Per-processor licensing fees are a prime example of that- a PC vendor that wanted to license a Microsoft OS would have to pay a licensing fee for every computer they sold, regardless of whether or not that computer had an MS OS on it. However, one could argue that this was a consequence of MS already having a monopoly (50% market share can be considered a monopoly in some markets), and they were exploiting that monopoly to become even more deeply entrenched. I honestly think that the desktop OS market in the pre-web days had very strong tendencies towards a natural monopoly regardless of whether or not any given player in that market was engaging in unfair business practices to achieve that monopoly.<p>Any time discussion about competing products revolves around which product is ultimately going to &quot;win&quot;, there is an implicit assumption that the market those products compete in tends towards natural monopolies. It may not be true, but the people participating in those discussions think so even if they&#x27;re not fully aware of it.",1395419599

If layout were performed by JS, there would be no hope: layout could perform arbitrary JS manipulations and we would be no choice other than to stall the main event loop while styling is happening (as current browsers do).

Right now we use it primarily as configuration/dependency management. We&#x27;re a small team and it seems to make setup easier, at least so far. Two examples: the first is a log sink container, in which we run redis + logstash. The container exposes the redis and es/kibana ports, and the run command maps these to the host instance. Setting up a new log server means launching an instance, and then pulling and starting the container. The second example is elasticsearch. We have a container set up to have cluster and host data injected into it by the run command, so we pull the container, start it, and it joins the designated cluster. The thing I like about this is the declarative specification of the dependencies, and the ease of spinning up a new instance. As I say, just experimenting so far, and I don&#x27;t know how optimal all of this is yet, so would love any feedback.<p>One last quick thought on internal discovery. A method we&#x27;re playing with on ec2 is to use tags. On startup a container can use a python script and boto to pull the list of running instances within a region that have certain tags and tag values. So we can tag an instance as an es cluster member, for example, and our indexer script can find all the running es nodes and choose one to connect to. We can use other tags to specify exposed ports and other information. Again, just messing around and still not sure of the optimal approach for our small group, but these are some interesting possibilities.",1395418596

They don&#x27;t protect against one of the most common fatal GA accident scenarios: loss of control at low altitude (base/final turn when landing).  In that case, there is not enough time for the parachute to inflate before the airplane hits the ground.<p>I&#x27;m all in favor of BRS being available as options and after-market STCs on all small airplanes, but we also need to make sure emergency training isn&#x27;t reduced to just &quot;pull the chute&quot;, since there&#x27;s a lot that can still go wrong outside of the chute&#x27;s operational parameters.",1395417851

6910339,comment,6907592,6910232,6,0,aleph_naught,,,"> The Koreans are very very bright and smart so I was puzzled by their inability to fly an airplane well. They would show up on Day 1 of training (an hour before the scheduled briefing time, in a 3-piece suit, and shined shoes) with the entire contents of the FCOM and Flight Manual totally memorized. But, putting that information to actual use was many times impossible. Crosswind landings are also an unsolvable puzzle for most of them. I never did figure it out completely, but I think I did uncover a few clues. Here is my best guess. First off, their educational system emphasizes ROTE memorization from the first day of school as little kids. As you know, that is the lowest form of learning and they act like robots. They are also taught to NEVER challenge authority and in spite of the flight training heavily emphasizing CRM/CLR, it still exists either on the surface or very subtly. You just cant change 3000 years of culture.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced this throughout my professional career as an engineer, to the point where I am very reluctant to work with foreign born asians.

If a type A is a subtype of B, then values of type A should be values of type B. Now let&#x27;s take an example from the number class hierarchy. Consider<p><pre><code>  1) forall a. Num a => a\n  2) forall a. Integral a => a\n</code></pre>\nAccording to what you have written, (2) should be a subtype of (1). That means that if I define<p><pre><code>  n = 1 :: forall a. Integral a => a\n</code></pre>\nthen I should be able to &quot;upcast&quot; with:<p><pre><code>  n :: forall a. Num a => a\n</code></pre>\nHowever, this doesn&#x27;t work, since the quantifier now ranges over types that were not in the range of the original quantifier. In the second type, I can instantiate the a to Float, while I cannot do so for the first type.<p>The only formal account of universal quantifiers in type theory, of which I am aware,  extends the term language by introducing a capital lambda that ranges over types. So the polymorphic identity function is actually the term<p><pre><code>  Λa. λx:a. x\n</code></pre>\nwhich is a function that takes a type a followed by a value x:a and returns x.<p>This makes good sense of the way number classes work in Haskell. When you write<p><pre><code>  n :: Num a => a\n  n = 1\n</code></pre>\nthe actual machine representation of n is going to vary with the type of a.<p>EDIT: Another way of explaining the counterexample: any type in Applicative is also in Functor. But, on one informal interpretation of forall, the intersection of all applicatives is actually a proper <i>superset</i> of the intersection of all functors.",1387133113

For each system action, we define a symbolic operation in our computational model.</i> (p. 217, 2nd ed.)<p>It&#x27;s true that by &quot;object&quot; they mean something more general than OO.

This practice also has the benefit of hopefully allowing the ego to settle some, and perhaps even allowing the baseline level that the ego is engaged to be less - or start towards that path anyhow. As you said, stress still maintains the same - it actually will feel potentially even more vivid, though that is likely counter-acted with the ability to process things easier. Learning other things, and doing deeper guided meditations and breath work, like yoga nidra - is a good way to lessen that. Physical movement, asanas - or yoga as a whole, meditation being a part of yoga - is a good way to help physically-caused stress and baseline stress reduce; There&#x27;s a biofeedback mechanism: tight muscles tells your mind you&#x27;re stressed, you being stressed tells your muscles to be tight. &quot;Nice&quot; little loop there.",1387132126

After college I threw away offers from these big companies Infosys, Wipro, Accenture or whatever and choose to work in startups. And boy, the job is awesome and you get paid fine, better than my friends in these so called big companies. I didn’t study in any of those NIT’s or IIT’s and I don’t think that really matters to you in any regard. My parent’s weren’t supportive and I have been asked several times to quit the job in india and go abroad and work. But I don’t think there is  anything negative in it. They have grown up in a situation where married life and job in a good company/government service were important. Make yourself clear to them and none is going to ask that to you again, they are educated enough to understand that and they will be happy as long as you are (and its a good thing about Indian parents).

I hear you. But what about the compelling inductive evidence we have that deterministic, if chaotic, natural systems are perfectly capable of establishing a feedback loop and modifying themselves?<p>IMHO, accepting evolution is all about wrapping one&#x27;s head around the notion that the result of this modification, when stretched over unimaginably large timescales, is significant change.",1387130457

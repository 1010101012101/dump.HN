You've written over the years that Tcl suffered from a marketing problem. No question. The rest of your anti(?) Tcl writings seem to make allusions to problems, but never really express what the problem _is_. I'd love to spend some with discussing this with you (email perhaps, or in quiet irc space?).<p>When <i>I</i> describe Tcl, I start similarly to you (Tcl's pretty cool...) and build on that, rather than detracting from it. Tcl is _fun_ like nothing else I've played with, has a <i>brilliant</i> C API, is incredibly dynamic, etc., etc.<p>Even despite the apparent lack of popularity, it's _still_ everywhere. Expect for system administation and job scheduling, etc,. Tcl in Cisco iOS, Tcl in F5 Network appliances, A10 appliances, driving Git gitk, embedded in Python to drive Tkinter, and a scripting/GUI interface for R, CSound, Vtk, ns-2 network simulator...<p>Tcl needs positive stories and it's successes pointed out, not ""It could have been cool, but it's not"". Regardless of where it sits in a popularity contest, Tcl is awesome, time-tested, rock solid... and _still_ improving.<p>Best,<p>-bch",1328939646

3578672,comment,3576819,3576924,1,0,twainer,,,"I disagree that one cannot distinguish between the likely ethics of a bootstrap or VC-funded startup. Logically, when a business has its own customers as the only means of support, there is a greater symbiotic relationship - sustained by age-old notions of fair exchange. I work hard to give my customer what they need so that they continue to sustain my business. A big side effect is ethical behavior.<p>The entities most capable of unfair or exploitative behavior are those who no longer need value that relationship to their customer. Yes, in one case this applies to companies close to failure - no matter their funding source. But as noted elsewhere, the acceptance of investor money adds many layers and new definitions to what 'failure' is.<p>Failure is no longer just 'going out of business' - it morphs to mean things like not having hit a number, not having made money fast enough, being pushed out of a job because people have lost faith in you, etc. The options for failure proliferate in an investor-funded corporation.<p>It's that same irony when a Fortune 500 firm makes a nice profit but the stock tanks because they didn't make as much as someone thought they should. Profit = success in the natural world; but somehow it gets turned around to equal failure - oftentimes costing real people their real jobs and costing companies real value of their shares that they could use to conduct real business.<p>So, as investor-funded companies are allowed only a small number of ways to define success, they are always closer to failure, and are forever more aware of the benefits of unethical behavior - especially when that behavior is so well-shielded by the corporate veil.",1328939075

3578649,comment,3577562,3578016,2,0,azakai,,,"> If Google introduces something like Dart or NaCl, is willing to support standardization of it and even release a free implementation, but other browser vendors don't want to integrate it because they don't like it, that's their problem, not Google's. If that means popular apps become ""Works best in Chrome,"" that is a self-inflicted wound.<p>I completely disagree.<p>First, if a technology is really bad for the web, are you saying other browsers should still implement it, just to not suffer the situation where popular apps work best in Chrome? That's bad enough as it is, but those popular apps are likely going to be Google properties - google.com, gmail. That means Google can basically force other browsers to adopt technologies as it sees fit, even if they are bad for the web.<p>Second, the WebKit situation on mobile exactly shows why this is wrong. If one popular browser adds special features and leaves them there indefinitely, in release versions of the browser - as WebKit does with its special CSS properties, and like Chrome does with NaCl and perhaps soon Dart - then people will develop for those features. If that browser then becomes dominant, those features will become a de-facto standard. Given Chrome's incredibly rapid rise, we should not assume it will not become dominant on the desktop, so this should concern us all.",1328937980

They may both be money, but one is a credit and one is a debt.<p>Practically, this is the difference between buying a house with cash or buying it with a mortgage. And that's part of DHH's point - the homeowner who buys their house with a mortgage they can pay only if everything goes right is hardly and barely the owner of their house or destiny.<p>I'd also add that the successful moon-shot companies don't justify the business model in-and-of-themselves either. An overnight success, beholden to investors with short time frames, that gets pushed to an IPO and into the arms of shareholders with an even shorter timeframe . . . not an attractive recipe in my opinion. Companies built slowly, organically, and personally are capable of more longer-term thinking and risk-taking then entities that more resemble a joint-venture between investors and contract workers glued together mostly by their dream of mutual exits.

Apple is threating to assert touch patents to prevent other vendors from implementing rich touch interfaces in the browser.<p>Eight years ago one might have called Java one of the most successful open source projects ever. Webkit could easily end up in a similar position. Given Apple's heavy litigation of their opponents, it seems almost inevitable.<p>So, the game has barely even begun yet. I suggest we revisit in 10 years and see how successful Webkit has been, for Apple, and our broader software community. (Because simply saying it is a success definitely suggests different things to different groups.)",1328936586

Despite that, nothing is more pleasing and fun than to trace problems in a system with which I am unfamiliar. And I'm either extremely lucky or extremely good at it. When asked to help with a sticky problem I can usually steer co-workers to a  solution fairly quickly. In a surprising number of instances the ""problem"" vanishes, never to return (unlike a Heisenbug).<p>My peers have somewhat ungratefully termed this the ""Asshole Effect""!",1328936483

He had done rock climbing in the past and might do it in the future, but it had been 3-4 years. Nonetheless he included it on the list of activities the questionnaire asks about. Next thing you know a simple process was drawn out over months and his premium was higher even than a smoker.",1328936471

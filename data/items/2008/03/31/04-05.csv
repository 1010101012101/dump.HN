OSS is generally more secure not because it doesn't have vulnerabilities, but because known vulnerabilities are patched up more quickly.

The authors are looking at which countries are creating lots of new high-skilled workers, and which are heading into a deficit of high-skilled workers (Germany and U.S.). In general, education systems from different countries don't map very well onto each other, but on the issue of high-skilled immigration into the U.S., the unit of comparison is ""education level that U.S. companies/politicians would consider high-skilled"".

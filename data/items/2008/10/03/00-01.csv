322305,comment,321782,321782,0,0,akeefer,,,"The author definitely makes a mistake in equating slow programs with poorly-written programs.  Yes, it's true that people who write horrible code often also write horribly non-performant code, and that rushing a product to market without performance testing is far too common in our industry.  But in my experience (and I've done a lot of performance tuning), making something perform generally requires selectively damaging the code by making it less understandable and by breaking rules about encapsulation and separation between layers.  There's a reason why that whole ""premature optimization is the root of all evil"" saying is so popular.  Performance tuning is also incredibly time-consuming and labor intensive.  It might make you feel more hardcore to do it, and it certainly be a useful intellectual exercise, but it's still time that could well be spent on other types of product improvement.<p>The increase in clock speeds has been a primary driver behind the ability of people to use higher-level languages, as well as the ability for people to write larger and more complicated applications.  So assuming that a stop to the increase in clockspeeds will lead to better software is flat-out wrong; if anything it'll help to essentially halt certain kinds of progress in language and framework development by preventing people from using higher-level abstractions that don't perform as well.",1222993202

I mean people people don’t get they don’t get smarter about things that get as basic as greed and you can’t stand to see your neighbor getting rich.

The story that people (such news reporters) tell to explain the day's trading. However it is a fair interpretation at the moment.<p>Dominating the world economy with only 20% of the worlds output is surely an impressive feat. But doesn't that make it even easier to see why it may not continue? If that 20% has a serious malfunction and has been relying on credit from the other 80% then don't you think portions of the other 80% are going to start asserting more independence?<p>If you think that the US will be able to continue to dictate economic terms to the world you are in for a rude awakening.",1222992878

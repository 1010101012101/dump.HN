It&#x27;s a good reminder why you shouldn&#x27;t trust the press.<p>The press gives more opinions than information, has a political agenda and doesn&#x27;t get the facts straight.<p>An ideal information source would just deliver tuples (fact, source) and leave the evaluation to the reader. Optionally, it could provide another stream of tuples (opinion, author).",1429019996

Just because the stereotype tends towards &quot;engineers&quot; (traditional meaning) being into mechanics, logic, programming, structures etc. doesn&#x27;t mean that everything can&#x27;t be viewed this way.<p>The popular guys at school and politicians are social engineers. Footballers look to solve the problem of helping their team to win. Dancers and bartenders look to solve the problem of how to get people to spend/tip the highest amount of money they can.  We look to manipulate logic to get machines to do what we want. Others may look to manipulate emotions and perspectives to get people to do what they want - i.e. spend more money, help them earn more commission. It&#x27;s all engineering in one way or another.<p>So to assume that we make more logical choices prior to marriage that result in longer lasting relationships might be a <i>touch</i> narcissistic. We are no different than anyone else, it&#x27;s just that we&#x27;re machine nerds. Other people are people nerds, football nerds, modelling nerds, advertising nerds, music nerds, history nerds, science nerds, food nerds etc. They all have problems they&#x27;re trying to solve and they all use their problem solving and logical skills to solve them, everyone a nerd in one way or another.<p>To typecast &quot;engineers&quot; (reading between the lines) as desperate does us a disservice. Everyone suffers from self image problems in one way or another - you can thank the media for that courtesy of beauty magazines, wrinkle cream, modeling mags, diet mags, a constant barrage of advertising telling you how to solve body problems and look better to get that hotter partner who also suffers from poor self image problems. You may suffer from poor self image of your perception of your lacking social skills (you really just never had the social training for how to talk with people) but want a hot model type. She may have poor body image because the beauty magazines make her feel ugly and you&#x27;re all she can get blah blah blah. It&#x27;s all quite nauseating really.<p>We all live in this Venn diagram of people we&#x27;re attracted to that would make good life partners. The intersection of which is where we&#x27;ll find long term relationship satisfaction (I&#x27;ll refrain from calling that happiness, because the relationship isn&#x27;t the whole picture of happiness)... but nobody knows where the intersection is and that&#x27;s the joy of life. When you&#x27;re not true to your Venn diagram, it&#x27;s painful. When you are and you find someone who intersects with yours in the right way, it&#x27;s amazing.",1429019788

Once the age issues hit women, they look for reliable and stable partners that would consider them a win at their age, for which engineers are prime candidates. Sorry for being cynical, as a photographer I handle a lot of desirable women and talk to them about what is important to them at various ages, and as an engineer can observe this basic dynamics - i.e. a no-longer super attractive woman rejected by most desirable men because her attractiveness falters hooks an aging engineer that had a crush on her while she was in her prime, and stays with him due to a lack of better options and desire for some stability, while he is happy beyond measure to get such a (formerly) attractive spouse.",1429019352

For example, I started undergrad as a physics major but switched to history in my second semester, while continuing personal study of my hobby interest of computing/programming.  I ended up getting a job as a webdev when I graduated (1999), and gradually moved into management.  In 2007 when my company laid off 20% of its technical workforce and the economy was starting to tank, I made a decision to go back to school for a masters in an area actually relevant to my desired work (manufacturing systems engineering).  I did and I learned a ton of useful stuff.<p>In these kinds of situations, it&#x27;s hard to overestimate the value of a master&#x27;s degree, because like others have said, besides the emerging MOOC opportunities, there aren&#x27;t really any other places where someone can spend either 1-1.5yrs full time or 2-4 years part time earning an advanced credential that&#x27;s globally recognized, in nearly any field.",1429018676

In the first case, you are solving a specific problem(homeless people don&#x27;t have phones, therefore they can&#x27;t even start looking for a job, or shelter), while in the other case you would have a hard time convincing someone to do it. And even if you did, someone else would come along, just like you did, and ask - why not give this money to a shelter, which knows what is better for those people/can provide more food/beds, or whatever? The thing is - people will ALWAYS have a better idea what to do with someone&#x27;s money, and I think we should appreciate all actions like this, even if we don&#x27;t personally agree with them.",1429018290

(This is something I&#x27;ve worked on before).<p>The way it works is you open a download stream from S3, pipe it into a Node.js transform stream, and then pipe that stream into an upload stream that uploads the data back to S3 using the multipart upload API.<p>The Node.js design is very much like using Unix pipes. You can pipe a huge multi TB file through grep without blocking anything. The data just streams from disk into the grep process, grep filters it down to things that match, and then streams the results onto the screen.<p>Computation on huge streams in Node.js works the same way. Your event loop remains unblocked even when operating on a stream TB&#x27;s in size because you are only ever touching a portion of the dataset at a time. Additionally if you do it properly your overall memory usage remains low as you are exporting the data back out of the machine as fast as it comes in.

The lenses and windows in the insurgents are made of IR-transmissive salt (often literally NaCl), which has to be kept dry and scratch free.<p>A better, and newer, option is to use Raman spectroscopy, which relies on the intrinsic molecular vibrations of a material (phonons) to shift the wavelength of interrogating light by a characteristic magnitude[1]. Once the Raman spectra is obtained, sample identification is a matter of finding the spectrum of the most similar compound in a database of known spectra. So in order to correctly identify something, it helps if it has been seen before and is present in the database.<p>Because Raman spectrometers are essentially a laser, some very narrow optical notch filters (band rejection at the interrogating frequency), and some fairly sensitive semiconductor detectors (often in the form of a mini spectrophotometer), the instruments can be made quite small.

For what it is worth I don&#x27;t think you deserve them, as your comments just show inexperience and lack of understanding of Node.js, and aren&#x27;t trolling. However, I think you would be well served by doing some research into what Node.js and and how it works. Basically every Node.js process has an event loop. Your workers have an event loop just like your servers do.<p>Here is how a typical node stack works:<p>Nginx load balancer talks to a cluster of node server processes, one per core. The server processes handle all incoming web requests that won&#x27;t block the event loop. On a typical REST server this is 99% of your tasks, and each node process can handle thousands of concurrent requests due to the way that the event loop works.<p>If there is a heavy, blocking task like processing an image or PDF file, (although even these things should be able to be done in a nonblocking stream manner) the server processes send a message through a background queue such as RabbitMQ, or Amazon SQS or the like to a background process which has the sole purpose of processing heavy tasks pulled from that queue. Fundamentally if you are using Node.js properly you don&#x27;t need multiple threads. Instead you use multiple processes, and the processes are essentially &quot;threads&quot; that can talk to each other either using parent/child processes communication, HTTP, redis pubsub, or any other mechanism you want.<p>But there is no reason why anything should block a Node.js process if it is written properly. I&#x27;ve even done heavy video transcoding in a streaming manner in a Node.js process without blocking the event loop.",1429017227

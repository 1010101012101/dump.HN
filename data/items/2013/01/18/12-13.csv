The system is the sum of the actions of its participants. In that sense, it is perfectly fine to call out individual actions ""lies"", even if they perfectly fit the system. That only illustrates the absurdity of the system.<p>Back to the facts: Carmen Ortiz (participant in the system) placed an upper bound of 35 years. She never placed any other gravity quantification in public on the record. All that is on the record is that she thought that the crimes are in the 35 years gravity class.

5078267,comment,5075672,5075672,1,0,kahirsch,,,"One side effect of these is that it's hard to figure out what the minimal parameters are needed to search when you're trying to create a keyword search (or similar task). E.g., I can type ""gna harry carey"" in my address bar to search in the Google News Archive, but they've broken my URLs several times and sometimes the fix was far from intuitive. (Right now, for gna I use  ""<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&q=%s&tbs=ar:1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&#3...</a> )<p>Since we're on the topic of Google searches, have other people noticed that advanced searches have become quite a bit worse over the last couple of years? The basic search is often quite astounding in how it gets what you want at the top of the results, but using advanced operators often produces quite strange results.<p>This is even more obvious in the non-web searches, such as Google News, Google Groups, patents, and Google Books. There you can see a result, but then if you add a restriction to the search, such as date range, or ""group:"" or ""ininventor:"", it won't find any results--even the ones you just saw which match new criteria.",1358511180

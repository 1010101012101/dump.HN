Block the network if you must to try to reduce the load, but don&#x27;t restart.<p>Part of the problem of being under high load is that sometimes data does not get written out to disk like it should (because of the load on the OS), so restarting can easily corrupt things - especially if you restart the computer rather than the service.<p>The other takeaway is reboot all your servers monthly! (Or after any changes.) That way you can be sure they&#x27;ll come back up properly. Reboot when you have time to work on it, so that you don&#x27;t have an emergency at the worst possible time.",1374649195

All your attempts to evade this point shows that you have no interest in any honest conversation.<p>This is not about end user choice, this is about end user rights. With GPL licenced code end users have the _right_ to the source code which created the _actual_ binary they recieve. They don&#x27;t have to demand the source code, but it is their right, they don&#x27;t have to examine, modify, run a resulting binary of their own, but it is their right.<p>These rights are NOT preserved with permissive licencing, and they are NOT granted by proprietary code.<p>You try to muddy the waters by saying that &#x27;users&#x27; don&#x27;t have to use proprietary code unless they want to, but again developers doesn&#x27;t have to use GPL licenced code so that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with this at all.<p>Whenever you want to use someone else&#x27;s code you are subject to their conditions, you sure see nothing wrong with setting conditions for using proprietary code (users can always say no), so by what logic do you think developers should not be allowed to set GPL conditions for their code?<p>Your communist rant makes you sound like some crazy right-wing extremist, you want to have the right to use other people&#x27;s code in your proprietary projects, but the notion of other developers instead wanting access to code used in conjunction with theirs in return somehow strikes you as some oppressive communist scheme??? Seriously???<p>You seem to think open source developers somehow owe you code to use in a proprietary fashion, and if they don&#x27;t provide it under such conditions they are &#x27;communists who wants to control other people&#x27;s code&#x27;.

6094821,comment,6085768,6091521,1,0,btilly,,,"This is a point about SR, not GR.<p>In SR, if A and B are two events and B is outside of the light cone of A, then reference frames can be found where A happens before B, A and B happen at the same time, and A happens after B.  Therefore FTL travel in one reference frame is traveling backwards in time in another.<p>The ability to travel FTL in a single preferred reference frame is not sufficient to cause causality violations.  That is because all trips move me forward in time according to the preferred reference frame, so I can&#x27;t wind up at the same time and place that I (in my personal history) was at before.  But if I can travel FTL in my choice of reference frame, in my choice of direction, then I can plan a trip from  A to B which is FTL in one reference frame, then switch and travel from B to A FTL in a different reference frame.  From the original reference frame I first traveled FTL, then backwards in time.  In the second reference frame I first traveled backwards in time, then FTL.  But both agree that two copies of me wound up at the same place at the same time, and I can try to violate causality.<p>Suppose that you go from SR to GR but are dealing with a large region that is approximately described by SR though locally it may look different.  In my &quot;warp drive&quot; there is no local FTL.  But the observations about SR, reference frames, and simultaneity still hold between two distant locations.  The ability to warp as fast as I like but only relative to one &quot;approximate SR reference frame&quot; does not let me violate causality.  But the ability to do it in any direction relative to any reference frame that I like, gives me the ability to construct &quot;closed time-like loops&quot;.  Which is what is required to try to violate causality.<p>Note that I say &quot;try&quot;.  It is possible that a unified theory of GR and QM could allow for closed timelike loops, but (thanks to quantum decoherence) would not allow you any meaningful interaction with the previous copy of you.",1374648772

6094819,comment,6094668,6094668,7,0,pcwalton,,,"> Hopefully in future Rust will adopt something like Gos automatic initialisation of all values to zero, or at least have this as an option (or document it better, if it already is an option).<p>First, thanks for the feedback!<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this feature will be added to Rust, though. IMO it causes bugs, as accidentally failing to initialize a variable yields a garbage value at runtime. There&#x27;s no reason that 0 is any more likely to be a valid integer value than 1, or 42, or 0xdeadbeef, and the compiler shouldn&#x27;t try to guess. And the feature wouldn&#x27;t work in Rust anyhow due to the lack of null pointers.<p>However, having an explicit zero value is convenient, and this is what the Zero trait is for. With Rust traits you can overload on the return value, like Haskell, so you can write:<p><pre><code>    let (emptyr: Room, emptyt: Tile, emptyl: Lev) = Zero::zero();
    let mut ls = [ emptyl, ..100 ];
</code></pre>
assuming that your types derive Zero (which you can do with #[deriving(Zero)]). In the future it should be:<p><pre><code>    let (emptyr, emptyt, emptyl) = zero();
    let mut ls = [ emptyl, ..100 ];
</code></pre>
This could be done by either writing a zero() wrapper in the prelude or allowing static methods to be imported, both of which are probably good ideas.",1374648694

    1980
    I started programming
    BASIC
    400 steps
    1988
    I met Emacs
    on Sun-3
    shared by 200 undergraduates
    I tried Emacs
    but I never used
    Emacs was prohibited
    It consumed too much precious memory
    We are free to download free software
    We are free to read the source code
    I downloaded Emacs source code
    and investigated
    Emacs was my rst Lisp interpreter
    I learned a lot about language implementation from Emacs
    Embedding integers in pointers
    Mark and sweep garbage collection
    Calling convention between Lisp and C
    I really understood how Lisp work
    I was fascinated by Lisp objects
    Lisp objects implemented by C
    Then I got a Sparc Station
    I started to use Emacs
    Emacs become part of me
    If I didnt like anything in Emacs, I could change it
    Emacs is totally configurable
    Emacs made me realize anything can be changed by a programmer
    It is total freedom
    I could edit without thinking key binding
    I didnt want to write anything without Emacs
    Programs, Documents and Mails
    so I wrote my own mail client
    named &quot;cmail&quot;
    in Emacs lisp
    It was my rst non-trivial (Emacs) Lisp program
    I used it everyday
    1993
    I started Ruby development
    with inuence from Emacs implementation
    Integers are coded in tagged pointers
    It uses simple mark andsweep garbage collector
    It uses similar object model to Lisp
    Then I put Smalltalk-like OO system on top
    For syntax, I wanted Algol/Ada/ Eiffel like one
    But as an Emacs addict, I needed a language mode
    auto-indent was a must
    Back in 1993, there was no auto-indenting language mode for a language with such syntax
    So I tried to write experimental ruby-mode.el
    fighting with emacs lisp and regular expression,
    for almost whole week
    I somehow succeeded to implement auto-indentation
    for a language with &quot;end&quot; delimiters
    If I couldnt make ruby-mode to work
    the syntax of Ruby would have changed
    to more C-like one
    too similar to other scripting languages
    as a result, Ruby would nothave gained current popularity
    Summary
    1. Emacs taught me freedom for software
    2. Emacs taught me how to read code
    3. Emacs taught me power of Lisp
    4. Emacs taught me how to implement a language core
    5. Emacs taught me how to implement a garbage collector
    6. Emacs helped me to code and debug
    7. Emacs helped me to writeand edit text/mails/documents
    8. Emacs helped me to be a effective programmer
    9. Emacs made me a hacker
    10. Emacs has changed my life
    forever

(Fun fact: One of the main developers, Jay Maynard [1], is also known as the &quot;Tron guy&quot;) Unfortunately, Hercules is as close as the average person can get to the platform without working for a corporation that runs z/OS (the modern successor to MVS) or Linux for System z (s390x Linux running on mainframe hardware) in their shop.<p>The platform has a big image problem. I personally blame IBM for not maintaining relationships with their education customers in the early 80s. The high cost of the hardware drove universities to adopt the new and exciting (ie cheaper) distributed platforms, and thus breeding a generation of distributed-minded graduates never even hearing about the mainframe platform except in history books. I know, because I was one of them.<p>Now the industry is now facing an exodous of their mainframe experts as most near retirment. The average age is something like 55-60, ready to retire [2]. There just isn&#x27;t any young, talented mainframers being educated. IBM has realized this, and they&#x27;ve started the &quot;IBM Academic Initative&quot; to partner with schools and incorporate mainframe into their curriculum. It&#x27;s a start, but the damage is done.<p>The technology, however, is top notch. The closed-source software/hardware model provides a lot of performance gains over the open source model. z/OS is updated every year and IBM releases new, faster hardware every year. And it&#x27;s not always more expensive. An EC10 can consolidate several racks of Linux blades into its zVM hypervisor (btw IBM has been doing virtualization for 30+ years) while processing  145,000 credit card transactions per second into a single refrigerator-size machine 24x7x365.<p>If you are looking for a new career, consider mainframe [3]. It&#x27;s the backbone of financial, retail and data processing industries. It may not be as glamorous, but it&#x27;s not going anywhere. And when all that old mainframe talent retires, you can write your own check.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Maynard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Maynard</a>

As you point out there isn&#x27;t a magic bullet, some forgotten design pattern or algorithm, or some clever slight of hand that will make your repository secure.<p>That leaves you with one of two choices, accept that it isn&#x27;t going to be secure and plan accordingly, or change the constraints.<p>For example, lets say you had exactly 1 volunteer who was willing to sign up to be your key signing authority, and as a volunteer they were only available on weekends. You could build a central authority but the throughput would be quite slow. That would impede your developers from getting authenticated and packages would take a long time to get out. But they would be signed and you would have some measure of trust in the packages as signed.<p>That might be unacceptable to your user base and they all go off and use something else (or as it often the case in open source they fork a new copy and decide theirs will have the rules they want). No amount of forking will create a secure system, so your constraints mean you choose risk and a wide pool of developers over less risk and fewer developers.<p>That a system that meets two incompatible constraints simultaneously is impossible should not necessarily stop you, but it can inform on what will happen in the possible futures. Its like growing old, you can say &quot;I never want to be older than 25&quot; but really there isn&#x27;t anything you can do about that, what you can do is say &quot;I always want to be able to do the following things like I was 25 ...&quot; and work on what ever sort of preventative exercises or stuff you need to work on to make that true, but you can&#x27;t stop yourself from aging.<p>So you can&#x27;t have a package signing system with the current developer environment. Awesome, what about package signing is important going forward and what about it isn&#x27;t as important? And given that, what changes can you make and what changes can&#x27;t you make?

I expect the keyboard to have quality components, which means no rubber dome switches used.  Buckling springs, mechanical switches, or capacitive switches satisfy this.<p>Ergonomically speaking, capacitive switches require the least force to trigger a key input, however they also have no tactile feedback by themselves and as a result there is no indication while touch typing that the key was actually pressed.<p>Capacitive switches are the least popular due to their cost and also the need to modify them to have some sort of tactile feedback so that the user does not bottom out the keys.<p>Cherry MX switches are the most popular among quality keyboards, however there are other mechanical switches available such as the Topre ones.<p>What switches the user will prefer varies; however the user can modify them to require less force to depress or have greater tactile feedback if they wish or simply swap them out for another switch that still fits the keyboard. The Cherry MX switches fit the ErgoDox.<p>Personally, I like the Cherry MX Blues, but the Cherry MX Brows that the Kinesis Advantage uses also had a nice feel; your mileage may vary here.<p>On top of the switches and springs used, the keycaps can be independently sourced and swapped out through various manufacturers; depending on the manufacturing process the keycaps will have different properties, some having a flat design that appears on the DAS keyboard, others having a depressed surface.<p>While an entirely aesthetic choice, keycaps also come in many different colors; so if the user wants keycaps with pink elephants etched on top the surface that is possible.<p>So far, the ErgoDox keyboard has been the keyboard I have found the least flaws with, and I now use it over my Kinesis Advantage all the time except when traveling, at which point I am resigned to the unfortunate keyboard design laptops have.<p>The one flaw the ErgoDox has is that the island of thumb keys are not all comfortable and not awkward to access while having the fingers on the home row.<p>I think that the Grand Piano keyboard design (<a href=""http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=44940.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=44940.0</a>) will rectify that issue though, and I am very anxious to actually be able to purchase a keyboard that utilizes the design as a result.<p>I love my ErgoDox and consider it state of the art as previously mentioned, however Acidfire&#x27;s design would have all of the features I like about the ErgoDox while fixing the issue with the thumb key placement that the ErgoDox and Kinesis Advantage have.<p>Fixing that will cause the thumb keys to be even more ergonomic for users like myself that want a control, shift, alt, fn, and a fifth mirrored key that is comfortable to use frequently in chords (a prominent design property in computing outside of designs employed by vi/vim).<p>I wish laptops followed the same design somehow while still not being massive in scale to accommodate that.<p>An 11&quot; or 13&quot; laptop with retina or better resolution with sufficient battery life to last 12+ hours per charge and an ergonomic keyboard available without using an external device is my ideal laptop, unfortunately such a laptop does not actually exist, so I will have to make due with only having 2 of those wants until then.<p>In addition to using an ergonomic keyboard though, I also regularly take breaks from using my hands, especially from typing and gaming, and use the colemak layout.<p>The workman programmer layout is hypothetically an even nicer layout for English, however not having that layout available by default in any OS is a deal breaker, so I use the colemak layout for that reason.<p>Using an alternative layout has not resulted in issues with touch typing in qwerty still, I can switch between the two fluently still; I was somewhat concerned that touch typing with a qwerty layout would become an issue starting out, but in practice it has not been a problem whatsoever.<p>I also use evil-mode in emacs and make use of meta, hyper, super, escape, shift, and control so that I can use key chords that only consist of a sequence of one modifier key plus a one non-modifier key in the vast majority of cases.<p>Having a hyper and super key in emacs allows me to avoid experiencing as much collisions that occur with default key bindings in emacs due to ctrl, meta, and shift becoming so overloaded in modes; I also abstract out common commands between modes to use the same chords consistently as they are not unified across emacs modes by default regrettably.<p>Doing so greatly reduces the solution space and required learning curve when changing between modes and states and implementing new features.<p>Aside from being a vim refugee, still using vim for some tasks, and being as lazy as possible to the point of aggressively eliminating anything that is redundant, potentially automated, and reducing what is reducible in effort, the reason I use evil-mode is that having access to vim&#x27;s modal design makes per state bindings available as well as per mode bindings.<p>As a result not only do I have chords that are composed of merely two keys to issue a command thanks to having a hyper and super keys, I also often have to press only one button to accomplish a task thanks to the potency of vim&#x27;s grammar.<p>All of these habits come together for a very comfortable and efficient computing experience with as little hazard as possible to my health without a career change, plus I have access to C-x M-c M-butterfly (<a href=""https://xkcd.com/378/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/378/</a>).",1374646957

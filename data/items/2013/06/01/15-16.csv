That experience is worth double what theoretical education is. So make sure you DO STUFF and stick it up on github. Write a blog about what interests though. Writing a blog is great at improving your language skills. Also take some presentation skills courses while you can as it is all about selling yourself and your MSc won't sell you sorry to say.<p>3. Zero. Nobody cares what uni you went to unless you are going into fields like medicine. Your experience and previous work (again stick stuff on github!!) will help more than saying you got a first from Cambridge.

Within the last 2 years, I have worked on projects for for small and large startups, as well as for brands such as AT&T, Anheuser Busch and Victoria Secret. Within that period I have completed over seven apps and two mobile SDKs. I am deeply passionate about mobile development and creating top-notch experiences.<p>What can I do for you? Here are some things I specialize in:<p>* iOS to Android Ports. Do you have an iOS app that you want to port to Android? I can take the existing iOS experience, modify it to conform to Android standards and deliver a polished high-quality Android app. I have done this successfully for multiple clients such Gving and Snapr (see my portfolio below [1]).<p>* Web Apps. Do you have a mobile site that you want to convert to an app? I can package the mobile web content and create a mobile app using a standard solution like PhoneGap or a custom web wrapper. For more advanced projects I can create a hybrid app that combines the best of the web and native worlds to fully access all the capabilities of the mobile device. Some sample projects in this category include JackThreads and Snapr (see my portfolio below [1]).<p>* App Rescue and App Optimization. Do you have an Android app that isn't quite working? Perhaps it crashes, it's slow or has other problems? I can perform a complete analysis, diagnose the issues and quickly fix them. For a sample project in this category see Loc8te in my portfolio below [1].<p>* SDKs. Do you have some awesome stuff that you want everyone to use in their own apps? I can put together a feature rich SDK that lets other developers easily access your app's functionality / services. I have done this for Snapr and Loc8te (see my portfolio below [1]).<p>Feel free to get in touch.

Certainly a majority of Republicans and Democrats are for it in the abstract. Mitt Romney wanted to ""staple a green card"" to every STEM graduate's diploma.<p>But that's not what the debate's about, and it's fairly silly to claim otherwise. The debate is whether or not any immigration reform will be ""comprehensive"", the Washington euphemism for amnesty and normalization of the existing illegal population. There is a not insignificant block of both Democrats and Republicans who will not allow anything short of a ""comprehensive"" bill to pass because they believe it's the only shot to achieve such normalization. There's also a reasonable argument often made that opening the doors to STEM graduates and other ""desirable"" workers while forcing the existing illegal population to continue to skirt the law is de facto discriminatory, because of the way the demographics of those two groups line up.<p>Zuck & Co. are taking the reverse position: They're pushing for the STEM reform they want just in case this time reform really does make it over the hump, and are happy to push for normalization as well, since it is the only likely path to that result.<p>Anyway, I don't know how I feel about normalization, but I do know that any nation that has skilled workers who will contribute much, much more than they take lining up to get in would be crazy not to let them in.",1370100203

There are a large number of real people out there who lose their jobs because of this.  Essentially their skills are no longer valuable, so they need to learn new skills.  How are they going to afford the insane cost of going back to school?  It's a tough situation, and even tougher if they have a family.  And if both spouses worked in the same labor market, they could easily fall into poverty trying to feed their children.<p>Of course structural changes won't ""doom us all"".  It <i>does</i> doom many people who suddenly find themselves in expired labor markets with no way out.

This article says:<p>> <i>The view from Silicon Valley is that a lot of the US talent, while bountiful in number, just doesn't stack up. But Silicon Valley doesn't want to just come out and say this, since it will sound offensive to a lot of American-born grads.</i><p>I mean, of course, only 5% of American engineers are going to be in the top 5% of American engineers, for example.

That's the entire conversation about ""A"" engineers. <i>Any</i> country needs to look outside its borders for additional top engineers.<p>Then, the article goes on to paraphrase Silicon Valley:<p>> <i>""Hey America, please raise the visa limit.

Meaning, at the time they attend post-secondary education / university.<p>The tuition and such are free, but independent students have significant living expenses that exceed the student stipend.  Further, the amount they can earn through work before losing the stipend is capped.<p>So, students borrow to cover living expenses.<p>Where the debt comparison with the U.S. weakens:<p><i>This is the key. While Swedish students end up with relatively high levels of debt, the monthly costs of carrying that debt are pretty cheap. (It’s about 3.8% of estimated average monthly income of new graduates, according to one study.) Interest rates are low. They’re set by the government and maintained through subsidies. And the length of repayment is long: 25 years or until the student turns 60. In other words, the Swedish system of student debt is financially manageable and sets students up to begin their lives as viable adults separate from their parents...</i><p><i>Across Europe, slumping birth rates represent a long-standing economic, demographic and social problem. Sweden, though, is something of a hotspot for European baby-making. Some see clear links between young people moving out of parental homes early and taking the necessary steps to become parents themselves. (Anyone who has ever lived with mom and dad into their 20s will understand this intuitively.) “Childbearing in developed countries almost invariably takes place after young adults have left their parental home, and home-leaving constitutes a central correlate of fertility and union formation in Europe and other industrialized countries,” wrote sociologists in this 2006 paper.</i>",1370099189

It's similar to the distance between atoms in the molecule, so the force is (relatively) big. Another important point is that using simulations to fit the data, they found that the main contribution to the force is not electrostatic, it's the Pauli repulsion (that is a quantum effect). Nevertheless if the tip ""see"" the molecule, then the molecule ""see"" the tip.<p>An important detail is that the Oxygen atom is small and it's not possible to measure how it is moved by the forces. The molecule applies a small force to the Oxygen atom that is attached to the Carbon atom that is attached to the big tip. The tip resonates like a tuning fork, and the small force on the Oxygen atom changes slightly the resonating frequency of the whole system. They measure this frequency shift and use it to calculate the force on the Oxygen atom.",1370099102

Bring your ideas to help increase educational access, and improve the user experience for both students and teachers.<p>We will also be beginning development on a new platform for distributing and hosting other open-licensed educational materials (beyond Khan Academy), as well as allowing teachers to author their own content -- offline -- to use in their classrooms as well as share back with the rest of the world. There will be exciting opportunities to be part of the design and prototyping phases of this new initiative over the summer!<p>We Offer the Following Benefits:<p>- You will be hacking on a piece of technology that has the potential to bring high-quality educational resources to literally billions of people who have never before had access.\n- You’ll be surrounded by a wide variety of development talent, from FLE team members, to professionals on the UC San Diego campus, and our internationally based partners. \n- You’ll have the chance to make real contributions to an ambitious development road map at a fast-growing startup nonprofit.\n- The UC San Diego campus is beautiful, the weather is perfect, and it’s only a five-minute walk to one of the world’s most iconic beaches. \n- A recommendation to our many partners in the tech and education industry.<p>Expectations\n- We believe that you’ll get as much out of this as you put in. If you want, you can work 20 hours per week, or you can work 40 (although we do ask for at least 20).\n- Set realistic goals for yourself and hold yourself accountable for reaching them. \n- Familiarity with some programming language and the ability and willingness to spend time on your own learning the technologies that we use (Python, Django, JavaScript, etc). \n- A commitment to providing access to education and promoting open content.<p>What life will be like: FLE is a pretty diverse group. Members enjoy playing soccer, board games, making marmalade, visiting Mexico (a 30-minute drive), doing Arduino projects, going to local San Diego Meetups, making sandcastles, bodyboarding, eating vegan food, playing various awesome instruments and learning to play new ones.

The amount of value gained from that is hard to overstate.<p>I've recently been teaching someone completely new to web development the principles of HTML and CSS, and she's been picking it up pretty swiftly, but otherwise not doing much with it which was terribly noteworthy. Until I loosened restraints, and got her interested in just playing with some new techniques for the sake of playing (which included that CSS challenge). Suddenly she was doing things I'd never seen before, layering radial and linear gradients for some cool effects, transforming and animating the result, and just bringing it all together in wildly innovative ways. (It helps that she has no idea about the bad old days where we were all incredibly restrained by limited browser support.) :) For the CSS challenge she had a definite goal, and I could just see her conceptual thinking leaping ahead as she bounced ideas off of me on how to reach that goal. In the process of this all she discovered two browser bugs (will still get her to file them after making certain they won't be dupes), gained a much, much deeper understanding of the finer points of various CSS3 modules, and had her self-confidence boosted a lot by knowing that she could really figure out these things and create something which would've seemed like magic to her just weeks earlier.<p>I highly recommend any- and everyone to, when it's not immediately obvious how a particular logo was constructed, pick it apart and _see_ the way certain effects are combined. Expand your thinking. Yes, there's an obvious way to build up your basic CSS for a bread-and-butter website, which just works, and there's often not much challenge or versatility there (nor needed). But the techniques and capabilities at the forefront of CSS are changing and expanding rapidly, and more and more of these techniques do actually become quite applicable to ordinary websites. Not in the particular combinations found in a CSS logo, but still in forms which will bear an uncanny resemblance to them. Why not have some fun teaching yourself about them? It's good to every so often remind yourself that you're in a very creative field of work, which keeps changing rapidly.",1370098986

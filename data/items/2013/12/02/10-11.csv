6832979,comment,6829725,6832133,3,0,w0utert,,,">> <i>This is probably the reason for Javascript&#x27;s popularity, but if you ignore some bad language design, Javascript is a very simple language with a very small number of concepts that you need to understand to start getting work done in it</i><p>I hear this a lot. JavaScript is great unless you [insert example why JavaScript <i>isn&#x27;t</i> great]. You could easily turn that statement around: JavaScript sucks, unless you don&#x27;t [insert example why JavaScript sucks]. It&#x27;s an empty statement that could apply to almost any development language no matter how objectively &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;bad&#x27; it is.<p>I don&#x27;t know Scala, but judging from the (interesting) article it appears that Scala can be perceived as a bad language because it allows you to write obfuscated, hard to read code that hides many details of what&#x27;s going on in the program. This can be both a good and a bad quality, depending on the kind of program, and the kind of developer. Personally I like languages that aren&#x27;t too opinionated or restrictive, so I might like Scala. Compare this to JavaScript, which is a bad language for the simple fact that it&#x27;s downright dangerous to program in looking at all the idiotic, arbitrary corner cases you have to avoid.<p>You could have a philosophical discussion about the merits of the design choices in Scala, I don&#x27;t think you could say the same about JavaScript though, it really is popular <i>only</i> by accident.",1385981883

I personally take it as a compliment for Haskellers: it means that people from the Haskell (and fp in general)community do think at a higher level than the average programmer, so much that it becomes for them difficult not to.<p>The FP model gives good tools to enable that, and encourage people to think that way.<p>I may also be biased because I feel more confortable thinking that way. Certainly programmers excelling at imperative programming might disagree, but I don&#x27;t think that the latest trends of &quot;functionalizing&quot; Java, C++ or PHP are coincidental. Javascript opened the way by bringing back that paradigm to a larger audience, and these languages, which already have FP concepts available, but not in a very usable way, are now incorporating them to the core. That&#x27;s a good thing.<p>Regarding the original topic, Scala is very much an experiental language in my opinion (because of the concepts it involves; the implementation is pretty good), so maybe there&#x27;s a little bit of thruth in the article in that regard. Perhaps that&#x27;s the &quot;flaw&quot; of academic languages. Also the comparison with Java is quite pertinent, Java being a language designed from the ground up for engineering: the grammar is fairly simple, which provided a somewhat good compromise between high readability (because of its similarities with C) and easiness at machine processing (not as easy as lisps dialect though).",1385981036

Most people live on (relatively) fixed incomes - a gradual lowering of prices for things that they buy simultaneously increases their quality of life by leaving a larger share of income for other purchases.<p>This is easily tested by most people - inflation adjusted, owning a device with the power of an iPhone is absurdly cheap by historical standards.<p>I would also argue that businesses are becoming less capital intensive in general.  Sure, specific types of business require multi-billion investments, but many other businesses are launchable now with essentially &#x27;zero down&#x27;. That&#x27;s a combination of automation allowing previously labor intensive tasks, and of automation lowering the cost of capital goods.  You can start a startup now with just a single laptop and some open-source software, the capital requirements are essentially nil.

I don&#x27;t use AdBlock; I have a few thousand lines in my /etc/hosts that map various bad actors (vast chunks of Javascript that doesn&#x27;t do anything useful, 1x1 .gifs, ads, annoying widgets, etc.) to 255.255.255.255 (NXDOMAIN), and use dnsmasq on that machine to get that benefit across to the rest of the local network, regardless of browser.  The thing that usually triggers another bout of &quot;block these hosts&quot; is if I notice that my ostensibly idle browser is burning CPU.  I don&#x27;t want to wait several seconds for a page to render, and I certainly don&#x27;t want to waste laptop battery time on refreshing an iframe with &quot;what people are saying about this on Twitter&quot; or feeding someone&#x27;s analytics server.  Half the time a site runs really slowly, it&#x27;s usually doing some nonsense that I&#x27;d be happier without, or my browser is waiting to download something that I don&#x27;t need to see.<p>The total amount of Javascript in kB is one issue, but you don&#x27;t need to hit the level of opcodes, I think.  Counting the nodes in the parsetree would be useful, as well as measuring the amount of memory that is allocated by the Javascript, determining whether it runs once or continuously or on some trigger (e.g., scrolling, hovering, mouse movement).  If you ran a profiler and measured the amount of time spent in the Javascript bits of your runtime (e.g., how long to parse the JS, how long to eval it, how often it runs, throw in some memory profiling) you could probably get some interesting numbers.",1385980502

6832871,comment,6828168,6830360,1,0,jarpineh,,,"I have been reading Grammar of Graphics, but it’s a slow going. I don’t yet see where the connection is with D3 and the Grammar, though (probably since I lack knowledge of the Grammar and don’t yet grasp the whole of D3). D3 works best with SVG constructs, where elements and attributes are manipulated based on what functions return. These functions then react to data, but D3 doesn’t really know what is in the data. It merely binds it to element’s __data__ attribute implicitly so it can know what to change when node gets selected. It’s the developer’s job to choose the right elements and attributes where results should be placed. Resulting graphic is an SVG document, which can look as a cohesive graph if developer gets the parameters right. This structure is often hard coded into script and not done with specific grammar that could calculate the graphic parameters consistently and reliably. This might be since D3 is intentionally low-level, but then there are parts that try to do more abstract things (like axes, that generate SVG directly). I feel this contributes to the lack of reusability.<p>Popularity of frameworks like Angular and the recent appearance of Ractive and React, as well as Fastdom (not to mention ClojureScript) suggests to me, that easy, efficient and reusable DOM manipulation is a hard problem and there can be many solutions. Its because of this I’d like to keep using D3’s great functionality (for me the scales and geo module) without its use of selections and W3C DOM API. There are other ways to declare a graphic and bind it to data, but calculating points for lines should not be coupled to a particular style of DOM manipulation. I like D3 a lot for discrete visualizations, but creating many interdependent graphics (like map and bar chart from the same data with interactivity between them) is not as easy as with, say, Ractive.<p>What I understand of Vega is that it works as a kind of grammar for graphics, but one that completely encapsulates the DOM manipulation. This allows it to support other render target, like canvas. I feel that this is opposite of what Alexandros is suggesting, that is to use D3 where it is good, but not parts which clash with Angular’s view of the DOM. If Vega makes it easier to use its functionality without the renderer, that would be great, but I don’t know how well it supports D3’s great functionality. This is on my study list, though.",1385979887

Nothing just keeps getting bigger. It will eventually deflate.</i><p>Yes, eventually every bubble will deflate - and arguably BTC is a bubble. But, that said, no one knows how big the bubble is going to get, or when it&#x27;ll burst, or how bad it&#x27;ll be when it does. It might burst tomorrow, fall to $50, and confidence will be so screwed that it never recovers to anything like the level it&#x27;s at now. Maybe. Alternatively though, it might continue to grow to $10,000/BTC and then deflate to $5,000. Investing now would still represent a fantastic return after then crash.<p>I <i>suspect</i> that when the bubble does burst it won&#x27;t actually be that bad for the reason that it&#x27;s quite hard to get your money out of BTC. Exchanges are slow - a sell order can take hours or even days in rare cases. Consequently, people aren&#x27;t likely to be able to cut their losses quickly, so they&#x27;ll end up with BTC they can either sell on at a <i>huge</i> loss, or keep. People will keep them in case they go back up. That supply side limiting will stop the market collapsing completely. Markets can only collapse as quickly as people can pull their money out.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t own any, so my speculation is irrelevant.",1385979406

Those following this path are sure to beat the net results (after fees and expense) delivered by the great majority of investment professionals. Seriously, costs matter.</i><p>True, he doesn&#x27;t say you <i>can&#x27;t</i> beat the market.

Unless you&#x27;re managing other people&#x27;s money, or have a 7-figure+ portfolio, I expect the time taken to do the due diligence necessary to consistently beat the market - if indeed such a thing is possible - would end up paying a lower hourly rate than you could earn doing other, more reliable, less zero-sum things.",1385978410

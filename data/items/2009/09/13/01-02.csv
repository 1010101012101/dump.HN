819711,comment,819655,819655,0,0,timr,,,"I think about outcomes rationally, but these days, I tend to think about opportunity cost a lot more intently.  Sure, if you tank a startup, you likely lose only your investment, and you'll probably learn a lot.  Problem is, you've also just spent N years of your life doing little but working like crazy.<p>If you're lucky, you've got about 80 years to enjoy on this planet.  You've got about 15 of those as a young adult.  How much are they worth?<p>(And just to pre-empt the obvious reply:  yes, you might enjoy working more than anything else.  If so, more power to you.  I'm only saying that you've got to take opportunity cost into account.)",1252807089

When I listen to music I'm appreciating the creative output of the artist; there's no need for it to be dolled up by animated web pages and visualisers and what not. In fact I find that kind of thing distracting and usually annoying, like those DVDs which have some half-ass custom menu effect meant to ""put you in the mood"" or something; I wish I could just skip it.<p>Still, glad (and somewhat surprised) to see it's not an encrypted, proprietary black box.

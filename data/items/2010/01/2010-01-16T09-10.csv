Rather, I would say ""knowledgeable.""<p>If you, even within your general field (say mathematics), talk to an expert, he will easily give you arguments that will seem sophisticated to you, and simple to him. He's spent more time learning, getting familiar with, and thinking about those arguments, and that's the simple reason.<p>Here, the Chinese government is through a nationalistic sentiment endorsing hacking and education about the same. It is a large country, and many of the people conducting the attacks were not amateurs, using already established techniques. They were professionals, I wager, learning, getting familiar with, and thinking about how to attain their hacking-goals.<p>An educated person, in any subject, will seem infinitely more sophisticated than a non-educated one. And I argue that China, more than anybody else, invests into young men doing just that.",1263634963

The biggest problem with government agencies are that you can't put them out of business by refusing to patronize them, so you have to whip the public into a frenzy and get politicians' attention. This should help with that.<p>As for TSA: I'm an American, I travel a lot, and I think TSA is absolutely a mess and a joke and a disgrace. I don't support how I get treated and how visitors to our country get treated. If we can get enough pressure to shut down TSA or reform it, who knows, maybe we can move on to other scummy branches from there.

And that's due to the fact that in news these days there really isn't much <i>there</i> there. Once you boil away all the high-gloss production values and the special access and the fame and the reputation you find out that at its core there is very little legitimate, original reporting work being done in the mainstream media. Which is understandable, because the big media companies learned long ago that hard journalism is difficult business, costly, and sometimes hard to sell to the viewing public. But the rate of return on glossy production values, infotainment, and pseudogravitas is through the roof.<p>But these tricks are approaching the limit of their shelf life. The big TV and print news organizations aren't attracting new, young viewers, their viewership has been getting old, and dwindling. They are rapidly approaching becoming inconsequential and that has as much to do with folks like Jon Stewart pulling up the stakes of their circus tent as it does with technology passing them by.",1263632898

235850,comment,235233,235781,0,0,gizmo,,,"The main problem is that most programmers never experience Unicode problems themselves. 7 bits is enough for most of us. So we only start using Unicode when the pain caused by incessant nagging exceeds the pain of implementing Unicode. So we never fix the Unicode problems out of curiosity, we fix them because people make us. No wonder we never learn.<p>The second problem is that we don't understand Unicode. Yes, we know that 7 bits isn't quite enough to represent all different characters, and that you have utf-8 and UTC, and so forth, but we really don't care enought to find out how it really works. We read some articles online, and we start using wchar_t / TCHAR instead of char, but that's basically it. Why bother with Unicode when you can simply write 'resume' instead of 'résumé'? Nobody cares.<p>That's what it boils down to:<p>Nobody <i></i>really<i></i> cares. So it doesn't get fixed.<p>The only mystery is why people <i>still</i> expect Unicode support to ""just happen"".",1215136720

So we don't have to be very good.<p>- The field is so young we still don't have adequate well-established standards and procedures.  Imagine ""release early and often"" as the standards for law, medicine, or bridge building.<p>I've heard this argument too many times from people who have never done it right so they think it can't be done.",1215136550

235837,comment,234988,235349,0,0,tstegart,,,"What would you say changing your links from using underscores to hyphens would be? Is that gaming the system, or making a better website? I mean, from a programming perspective, it doesn't sound like it makes much difference, but from an SEO perspective, it makes a huge difference. Google recognizes words when they're hyphenated, but not necessarily when they're underscored. Your rankings will probably improve just by doing that. Its simple things like that that programmers should be aware of, and its not really gaming the system, its programming to match what Google recognizes.",1215134219

179127,comment,178385,178841,0,0,nostrademons,,,"If stocks really grew faster than bonds (outside of risk), wouldn't it make sense for investors to take some of the money they have in bonds and put it in stocks, thereby increasing their total return?  That'll drive the price of stocks up and the price of bonds down, driving total returns for stocks <i>down</i> and returns for bonds up (since you can get the same bond more cheaply).  The process should only stop when investors are indifferent, on a risk-adjusted basis, to stocks & bonds.<p>That's what the grandparent means by ""inefficiencies are arbitraged away"".<p>As for equities funding more high-growth areas of the economy - you need to make a distinction between primary and secondary markets for capital.  The primary market is where actual, producing firms offer part of their capital structure (either debt or equity) up for sale.  This is often associated with entrepreneurs, investment bankers, venture capitalists, and private equity.  The secondary market is where financial firms trade securities of existing companies - hedge funds, mutual funds, and retail investors.<p>In the secondary market, investors always have the option of bidding up the prices of securities that they really, really want.  As a result, it doesn't matter how well the economy does, it only matters how well the economy does <i>relative to how people expected it would do</i>.  If people expect the economy to shrink 10% but it really shrinks 5%, stocks (in the secondary market) will jump.  If they expect it to grow 20% but it really grows 15%, stocks will crash, even though absolute growth rates are significantly higher.  That's why only <i>unexpected</i> earnings have an effect on a company's stock price.<p>The primary market is much less liquid and hence less subject to arbitrage opportunities.  If a company is growing very well, it will be able to charge a higher price for its securities, and the proceeds will go directly to its balance sheet.<p>So, the fact that high-growth industries tend to be financed with equity rather than debt means a lot for entrepreneurs and venture capitals, but very little for investors in the public markets.  For that matter, a number of studies have found that ""growth"" stocks do significantly <i>worse</i> than ""value"" stocks, because investors consistently overweight their growth prospects.",1209689656

It's probably been rewritten far more than Twitter has, you just never hear about it because TechCrunch doesn't have a source inside.<p>In my experience, that's really the only way to do software.  It's completely unrealistic to think you'll get it right the first time, and yet completely destructive to go and start from scratch.  So you pick your worst problem, rewrite it, then hook it back into the working system without touching the rest.  Then pick your next-worst problem, rewrite it, etc.",1209687444

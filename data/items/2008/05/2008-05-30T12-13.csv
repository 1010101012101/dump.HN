204278,story,,,1,0,jkush,"Clever Advertising: What I heard on my drive in this morning",,"I saw/heard some clever advertising this morning. At least, I think it's clever - it's possible that this is an old trick but I've never come across it before.<p>On my drive in this morning I saw signs along the side of the road. They were advertising a new radio station called ""HouseTalk AM 1650"". Being the highly suggestive person I am, I tuned to the station and heard a woman's voice advertising for a modular home business in the area.<p>The ad simply looped and as I drove out of the area, the ""station"" lost it's signal and eventually faded out.<p>Summer in Maine is all about tourists and ""summer people"". The business that put this ""station"" lies along one of the major routes that people drive on their way to locations in Downeast Maine.<p>Many tourists buy land and build homes here when they retire. I'm sure that many tourists who spend the summer here year after year often think about buying or building a small house in Maine that they can visit when they want to (a lot of them do exactly that).<p>This is pretty clever advertising. This transmitter for example costs less than $100 and will send a signal out for 1-2 miles.<p>Cheap advertising + captive audience in cars + a message lots of people will be interested in = clever.",1212151934

204270,comment,204038,204038,0,0,ideas101,,,"because you need 2 things (residency and geeks) no matter where you live you have to be mentally prepared to live there for a year or 2 before you move permanently. i would suggest to file for immigration for canada and in the mean time find a temporary place to live couple of years. the best thing is to shortlist top 2 places and then apply for immigration at one place and move temporarily to the place that was 2nd on the list (who know you may like 2nd place more than the first one).<p>Also if you file for canadian PR (while you're in US) then it won't take longer - US cases are faster than other countries but you need to file while you are living in US.<p>Your choices:
Asia: Singapore, India, Indonesia, Philippines<p>Europe: any eastern europe that has good weather and geeks.<p>Far East: Australia (btw australia also has immigration policy, and fantastic weather)<p>Middle East: Abu-dhabi and Dubai (most happening place, no tax, you just need to find good geeks or import it from India).<p>Good Luck.
P.S: Find out everything about Australia and Canada - they both have immigration policy - in fact i recently heard that australia has something like temp work visa for people under 30 and then you can file for permanent residency.",1212150310

204264,comment,204050,204050,0,0,jcromartie,,,"These are great things to keep in mind for online communication.  There are a lot of logical fallacy fanboys online.  Their M.O. is to look for the tiniest gap in your <i>method</i> of debate and then latch on to it like a terrier.  Their initial hope is that their wall of logical rules is impenetrable to you.  Then, even though they are accusing their opponent of logical fallacies left and right, they end up on the <i>Sleight of Mind</i> path rather quickly!  Maybe now this list can serve as a counter for that behavior (although they probably won't respect these as ""real"" fallacies).",1212149839

204262,comment,204145,204145,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"A fellow sysadmin that I used to work with did a brilliant job of pranking me by quietly changing my ksh ENV variable to another file, and then aliasing a handful of commands (like su) to some brilliant ascii art taunts. As an added bonus, if I didn't clean the mess up in a specific order, then it attempted to repair any missing bits of itself.<p>I didn't know about the ENV variable at the time, so it took me a few minutes to puzzle out. I cheated with a carefully crafted find command.<p>We used Mac workstations in that office. The Mac OS has a sort-of vulnerability where, if you can get admin access to it, you can create an invisible administrator account on the machine with ssh privileges. I always wanted to do that, and then modify the su command on our server to watch for his username, ssh back to his machine, and play the ""Oh my god, they gave you ROOT?!"" clip from Jeffrey Hitchins' ""Tech Support"".",1212149706

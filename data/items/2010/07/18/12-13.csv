He did an interview shortly thereafter, where he was asked what genre he'd put it into.  His response was brilliant: ""It's music, and I like it.""<p>I couldn't describe my own standpoint on what music I like any better than he did.  While there are many genres in which I dislike the vast majority of the content, I'll give anything a shot and won't let a silly label stand in the way of liking something.

This was for oral surgery, and I had every confidence in the doctor, but there were times during the procedure (as my gums were being cut open) when I noticed her being, how can I say, respectful or dainty, with my mouth, and I was thinking to myself just get in there and do what you have to do! I'm pretty numb here! lol (the work was top notch) but I guess it did make the overall experience a bit nicer. :)<p><i>I find that in female-majority environments, there is much more lie-to-your-face while stabbing you in the back type behavior.</i><p>Wow.<p><i>The flip side of that is that people here seem to make less effort to understand my admittedly ""alien"" perspective.</i><p>Sadly, I think Americans can be guilty of this in general, often times, including myself.<p>Thanks for sharing. :)",1279455065

I obviously do not know much about programming anymore, but this would be a very Windows specific application-- it needs to track files and execute when they are accessed.  I'm not sure if that is an option in Java or Python.  I've got quite a long time to go before I am up to speed with where I was 9 years ago.<p>I have pondered writing a blog about it all-- my return to programming, some life hacking stuff and an online comic idea I'd like to launch soon-- but I have always assumed that as a relative nobody, I'd be wasting my time since it would be unlikely that anyone would read it.

Being a monarchy does not mean that you'll have a monarch who'll dabble in every little political debate-du-jour.

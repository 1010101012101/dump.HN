171454,comment,171144,171430,0,0,suboptimal,,,"Hey mn,<p>Java used to be ""Oak,"" and according to our good friend Wikipedia it was created in ""June 1991."" I thought it was later but guess not. It had the whole set-top box history, and would eventually run our fridges and toasters in the 21st century.<p>Seriously though, do you remember when Java was released? It was fun! And definitely considered the ""hip"" language at the time, much like Ruby is now.<p>I think it's interesting that so many in the Java camp have jumped ship to Ruby, because what is said about Ruby now, was said about Java then.<p>But they're still nearly the same age, so the ten-year spread in their respective heydays is sort of amusing. It's like Roger Moore supplanting Connery as Bond ten years later, despite the fact he's older. ;)",1208953444

 Could be of use to set a base level of memory retention and then use that to define the length of time between repetitions?",1208953337

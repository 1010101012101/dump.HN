2574343,comment,2574204,2574322,1,0,wbhart,,,"Am I reading this right? Chuck Moore decided that all programming could be done with sourceless coding and his demonstration of this was a graphical application? This is so common, yet so totally wrong. It's akin to the ""revelation"" that algebra is not necessary in mathematics because all mathematics can be ""visualised"". Which is equally stupid. However, I may just be misinterpreting what is being said in that quote. After all, I don't know why he then switched back to Forth, which is not sourceless, I am guessing.",1306101559

If hypothesis A completely explains the data, and hypothesis A+ completely explains the data but includes extra axioms, Ockham prefers A over A+.  One simplified argument that can be made is that A+ has a higher probability of containing wrongness, since it contains any wrongness that is in A plus any additional wrongness contained in +.<p>When choosing between two disjoint hypotheses, A and B, both of which completely explain the data, Ockham's Razor is significantly less useful.  Whichever of A and B is longer has more places it can be wrong, but the probabilities of wrongness in any particular place are uncorrelated between A and B.  Ockham (or Kolmogorov Complexity or whatever form of the argument you like) suggests a preference for the simpler of A and B, but it is not a very strong suggestion.",1306101540

When you detect a file name conflict, construct a distinguishing prefix for each conflicting file from the difference in tags on the conflicting files. (If all the tags are the same, then fallback to a synthetic prefix or overwrite the file or error out or whatever.)<p>For example, let's say you have /photos/london/DSCN0001.JPG and /photos/vienna/DSCN0001.JPG, where ""london"" and ""vienna"" are both included in ""europe"". This could yield paths like /photos/europe/london:DSCN0001.JPG and /photos/europe/vienna:DSCN0001.JPG.<p>The big trouble here (and, if I understand, with what you're suggesting as well) is that changing the name or tags of one file can alter the path to another as a side effect. So if I started with just /photos/vienna/DSCN0001.JPG, I might reference it as /photos/europe/DSCN0001.JPG somewhere.

And indeed, I consider JONESFORTH to be one of the highlights of the coding world. But these days I don't find a use for the language per se.<p>I have to say, however, I would love to see an interpreter for FORTH which does not actually maintain a secondary stack at runtime, but compiles the code down to something equivalent, e.g. uses the LLVM Jit.<p>Much of what is done with the second stack is simply reordering bits of data or duplicating bits of data. This could all be done at ""compile time"". Each stack location would only exist at compile time. At runtime the values would be stored in ordinary variables and references. There'd be no need to duplicate data or reorder it at runtime.

Something else?<p>I recently got into microcontroller programming (using both AT90USB162 Atmel microcontrollers and PIC24H PIC microcontrollers). I use them for building/hacking/tinkering with MIDI controllers.<p>I'll give you a brief overview of how I started and what I'm doing now and then if you want to know more, you can comment or email me or whatever and I'll be happy to help, if I can.<p>I started in February, when my brother and myself decided to mod the Midifighter[1] he has. The Midifighter is interesting because, not only does it have an awesome arcade feel to it (because of its arcade buttons), but also it has been designed to be very hacker friendly: DJ Tech Tools (the guys who make it) have released the schematics under the creative commons license and the source code under the GPL. The circuit board also contains solder points for power, ground, four digital extension pins and four analog extension pins - so it is easy to extend.<p>What we did is built an extension which connects to these extension pins, giving the midifighter an additional 17 LEDs, 14 buttons and 8 analogs (4 pots/knobs, 4 faders) - actually, technically, it gave us 32 analogs, which we use for 16 buttons, 16 knobs/faders - though 10 connections are left disconnected.<p>The rest is in the firmware: shift buttons, banks, changing MIDI channel on the fly, etc. Also, the difference between the button extensions and analog extensions is purely in the firmware (and of course what we connected to them).<p>Some details for our mod can be found here[2], the modded firmware source code is on my github[3], more details, pics, videos to be put online soon.<p>This basically taught me everything I know about hardware hacking.<p>What I am doing now is working on a configuration (tool used to configure a midifighter from your desktop) as well as some awesome new firmware mods for existing Midifighter owners (eg, I already released an early prototype version of a mod which allows you to record keypresses and have it automatically play back the MIDI notes in a loop). My brother and myself are also planning our next MIDI controller hardware, which will be even more ambitious than the first.<p>So, from my experience, I would say the best way to learn is to just dive right in! Be prepared to make a few mistakes along the way (which may end up costing a few $, but its worth it for the learning experience - eg, we ordered a few of the wrong parts at first) and just experiment. The midifighter was a great way to get started because it is an open platform and a cool toy. You could just as easily start with an Arduino (a lot of people do!) or something like the Chameleon[4] (actually, the xgamestation.com website has a few cool electronic devices which may be great ways to get started!).<p>[1] <a href=""http://midifighter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://midifighter.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.djtechtools.com/forum/showthread.php?t=28014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.djtechtools.com/forum/showthread.php?t=28014</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://github.com/dublindan/Midifighter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/dublindan/Midifighter</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.xgamestation.com/view_product.php?id=52"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xgamestation.com/view_product.php?id=52</a>",1306100116

2574260,comment,2573944,2573944,7,0,ScottBurson,,,"The problem with equality in Common Lisp is that the fundamental data structures don't come with enough semantics that one can tell, just by looking at one, what it is being used for.  For instance, a list structure can represent a sequence, an unordered set, an s-expression (a tree of sequences), a binary tree of conses, an alist representing a map, etc. etc.<p>Using higher-level data structures, each with a clear semantics, clarifies the meaning of both equality and copying.  For example, my FSet functional collections library for CL has separate types for sets, sequences, maps, bags, and tuples, along with a generic function EQUAL? that has methods for all these different types.  Thus one can construct nested types -- sets of sequences, maps whose domains are sets, etc. etc. -- and compare them by just calling EQUAL?.  In bare CL one would pretty much have to write a separate equality function for each such type.<p>A critical distinction, in order to make this work, is that between object types and value types.  Objects have identity and state; value types do not.  When used with user-defined types, FSet requires this distinction to be made explicit: you have to say whether your type is an object or a value, and you have to be consistent about it.  This way, it's always clear when equality should be ""shallow"" or ""deep"": equality comparison of object types is always by identity (""shallow""), while comparison of value types is always by content (""deep"").",1306099541

If I like reading books, I may like to join a community where my profile is a bookshelf and I share reading lists and favorite authors.

Why would I want to do that?""</i><p>I was in undergrad at Virginia Tech from the fall of 1999 to the spring of 2003. The total cost was less than $30,000 for all four years. Of course, keeping me fed and housed all four years cost more. I find his argument disingenuous, because only the elite private schools cost that much. Of course, it would be equally disingenuous for me to imply that everyone has access to a decent state school with relatively low in-state tuition.

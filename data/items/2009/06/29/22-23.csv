679824,comment,679585,679751,0,0,frossie,,,"Re: the China study (of which all I know is what I just read on Wikipedia).<p>I don't want to tell you what to believe, but for the record the correct scientific measure for morbidity is ""all-cause"" mortality. For example, suppose I say to you that eating M&Ms halves your chance of death from liver cancer. Your response should be ""What are my overall chances of dying""? For example, while it halves your chance of death from liver cancer, maybe it doubles your chance of death from pancreatic cancer. It is not enough to say that diet X ""lowers the instance of Western diseases"" - the realy question is, does it genuinely stop you from dying. Of anything.<p>Once you have shown that an environmental factor is indeed correlated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, then the next thing to do is try to prove causation (since we all know correlation is not causation). For example if you told me that the average life expectancy in China is 100 and in the west it is 70, I would say ""so if you parachute a bunch of Westerners in China, would they live to be 100?"". It may be that Caucasians, exposed to the ""Western Diet"" for millenia, are actually well adapted to it.<p>These are very hard questions to answer to a high level of scientific confidence. I also don't like the implication, as reported in Wikipedia, that if lots of animal protein is bad for you, 0 is bound to be better. Every single substance known to man has a poisonous dose and a safe dose. There's a safe dose for arsenic. The burden of proof to say that 0 of something is meaningfully safest is very high.<p>I'll give you a well-researched example. Mercury is a neurotoxin. In certain quantities it causes terrible mental decline. There is mercury in fish, mainly in the fish that are high up the food chain (eg. swordfish, marlin, the big tunas etc). So, in the US it is standard to advise pregnant women not to eat fish, so as to avoid exposing the foetus to significant levels of mercury, which from experience with industrial workers can cause low IQ levels and other problems.<p>You would think that is cut and dry? It turns out that if you go and study Pacific Islander populations where all they eat (three meals, 7 days a week) is fish, then there's nothing wrong with their kids.<p>Why? I don't know. The point is that even with one single chemical compound and one well-known effect, it is really hard to understand what goes on inside the body. So doing so when you have something as complicated as nutrition on one hand, and longevity on the other, is really <i>really</i> hard to do, and in principle I distrust anybody who claims to have a simple answer.<p>I mention all this because you seem to have good motives and say you are building a business on this. I suggest you look a bit further than one or two best-seller books before you commit yourself.",1246314819

679802,comment,679219,679766,0,0,Retric,,,"The profit from ""green"" energy needs to exceed the interest on the loan it takes to build it.  Today the loans are still slightly more costly than the profit.  It's like 5.9% profit vs 6% cost of a loan.  The math get's complex as you need to take into account inflation, the rate of depreciation of your assets, and taxes.<p>This magnifies the amount of wind farm you can build today.  If you had a billion and wanted to donate it to ""clean energy"" then you could get a loan for 5 billion in wind farms and use your billion to make up the difference.  By the time the loan was paid off you would still have some money, but far less than if you had invested it well.<p>If on the other hand you a billion dollars and built a wind farm without borrowing money then you can keep expanding indefinitely. You would still have less profit but there would be little risk.<p>PS: With subsidy it is profitable today which is why we are building so many wind farms, but that's just the government handing out money.",1246314073

I remember one time the city had shifted their output by 90° (or something like that...this was years ago).<p>Our datacenter UPS was tied right into the 3-phase output and didn't recognize that the power was still flowing from the city. The diesel engines fired up and started powering the datacenter (redundantly). When the gas ran out a few hours later, <i>everything</i> started shutting down. It was terrible. Hundreds of servers with 600-800+ days uptime all went down and stayed down for hours. We were shuttling people from the office down to the datacenter to fsck and bring machines back up. It was a long night and long next week issuing credits to customers who had lost data.<p>Today I've got servers with Verio, Bluehost, and LayeredTech. They've all been great for the most part, but none of them have been <i>near</i> perfect. I know that most hosting companies I've worked for or dealt with put uptime near the top of their list of priorities because they know it's an easily measured number people bank on.

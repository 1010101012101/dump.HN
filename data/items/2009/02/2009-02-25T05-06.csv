Contracts only state assumptions about how code should behave, but they don't make sure those assumptions are correct, only tests can do that.",1235540775

But all I'm hearing here is cheap bashing of the target that everyone loves to hate. Can anyone do better and post an intelligent comment that addresses the topic?<p>Again, TechCrunch is not boring. One of its strengths is not so much the ""breaking news"" aspect, but the tongue-in-cheek or tell-it-like-it-is.<p>In many news organizations, politically correct has removed any spark of interesting content. Not at TechCrunch. It's news with an attitude. You may or may not like the attitude, but at least there's one.<p>[disclaimer: you can accuse me of bias because of my company connections to TC, but it also means that I got to see some of the behind the scenes and I learned a lot doing so]",1235540160

Actually, you could use FairSoftware, find people, use our Software Bill of Rights to start your business, and never pay us a cent.<p>You only pay the processing fee if you use our payment backend. If your project consists of two people, then by all means, work out a deal by yourselves. But if you are trying to build something with a larger community of contributors, and having transparent sharing brings value and trust to your contributors, then you'll find out that our fees are reasonable.<p>And as someone pointed out, we don't actually charge much at all for ourselves, we mostly pass other people's fees (PayPal) to you so we don't lose money. We are working on lowering the total fees, and it has to do with ACH and treating non-US contributors differently than US contributors, but we will eventually, in order to save money for you.<p>There are scenarios where we are way cheaper than any alternative. If you are a couple of students with very little money to invest, we give you a legal structure, some amount of protection and privacy from your end users, for literally no money down.",1235539703
494063,comment,494019,494019,0,0,patio11,,,"I yield to no one in the category of ""Charge money for value"", but I have to agree with Anderson on this one: Non-monetary value can still be turned into money.  Its not rocket science.<p>The simplest case for it is search engine rankings: people like linking to free things.  Accordingly, putting free things on your website gets you lot of links.  Links get you search engine rankings.<p>I segment my market into two slices: one which is likely to need my application a lot more than they need their money, and one which is not.  The free stuff is designed to satisfy the ""I'll keep my money"" segment (and thus get links from them) while piquing the interest of the ""Please, SOMEBODY, help me"" segment.  The paid software is worth its price (and then some -- I just bumped prices by 20% and after seeing sales data I might do it again) to that segment.<p>Github does this really well, too: we'll give you access for free if you're an OSS project (ooh, look, you attract links in spades and don't care that your source is public) and we'll charge for access for private repositories, without which your boss would have a conniption fit if you are developing commercial software.<p>There are other ways to do it to.  Demonstrated expertise (free) leads to perceived expertise (free) leads to consulting opportunities (decidedly unfree).  Demonstrated expertise (free) leads to perceived expertise (free) leads to business opportunity (free) to improve your sale of widgets (unfree).  Demonstrated expertise (free) leads to perceived expertise (free) leads to employment opportunity (unfree).  etc.",1235539597

I love coding for in Lisp but I haven't really made the leap to production code since I have to support 4 platforms with all code I write for work (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux on x86, Linux on ARM), and deploying Lisp code across all those platforms auto-magically reliably SUCKS. We write all our stuff on the JVM so this would be easy to bolt on and expose to new people.",1235538877

494052,comment,493963,493963,0,0,neilk,,,"Look up the technique of ""dependency injection"" sometime. This is all the rage among Java consultants, their favorite technique to make things testable. It's an elaborately disguised way of saying ""let's rewrite this function so it obtains all its state from the caller"". In other words, functional programming.<p>In cases where passing the same list of initialized objects up and down the call stack becomes tedious, Google's Java people have invented frameworks like Guice. This makes dependency injection appear to happen by magic.",1235538379

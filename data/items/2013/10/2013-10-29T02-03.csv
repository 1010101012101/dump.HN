If both Google and the site linked to by Google are secure, then the referrer would be intact, and contain the search terms, which is where Google Analytics and every other tracker has picked them up for 15+ years.<p>Google purposely added another level of indirection between their search result page and the search result links themselves. When you click, a bit of JavaScript rewrites the link to a script at google.com/url in order to wipe the real referring URL. Should Google want to do that for reasons other than masking search terms, like recording clickstream data from their SERPs, they could easily add the search term to that google.com/url link&#x27;s query string.

Starting with the iPhone 5, that was released in FY2012 but primarily sold in FY2013, there were considerable supply issues along with some blowback on the new Lighting connector. Moving onto the iPad Mini we have a low resolution tablet with a -1 generation processor at a premium price. All indications are it sold well but I&#x27;m not sure it spoke well of Apple&#x27;s reputation selling quality products. The display was simply not good and a quick glance could inform any non-technical people of that. We also got the iPad 4 which was merely a CPU upgrade with no reduction in weight or thickness.<p>Then we have the new iMac which also faced some supply problems and delays and offered customers something they probably didn&#x27;t even care about -- a thinner desktop all-in-one PC. IIRC the Ivy Bridge update to the Mac Mini eliminated a SKU that offered a semi-decent GPU. Then Apple disappeared for a very long time and later in the year introduced Haswell updates to only the MacBook Airs leaving informed MacBook Pro would-be buyers facing old technology with a premium price tag.<p>Next we have the iPhone 5C which in most ways is a step backwards from the premium quality iPhone 4S (or would be iPhone 5) that occupied that price point. Contract free the device is totally non-competitive on pricing compared to better Android devices. The 5S was quite a good -S model upgrade however consumers are starting to get wise to the tick tock strategy and perhaps are choosing to wait for the iPhone 6 upgrade.<p>I&#x27;ve been watching Apple for quite a while now and FY2013 was not a great year for product upgrades.

Can you prove that it is impossible to run those 100 companies any more efficiently, that sustainable energy and efficient use of water can never be made profitable?<p>Your original assertion was &quot;The notion of economic growth is tied to environmental and human labor exploitation, at fundamental levels.&quot; You have fundamentally not proven that assertion with this evidence, that it is impossible to have economic growth in a sustainable way. What you have done is point out our current inefficiencies, not that the laws of physics preclude it.<p>>It has worked out great so far right? I don&#x27;t think the US, which is a highly functional democracy, optimizes for those problems (environmental, social) rather than accumulation of wealth.<p>Right, because you have evidence of problems in the current system, it means it is irrevocably broken? To be replaced with what? What is your alternative than, Marxism? This sounds a lot like the rhetoric of the right who point to government failures and then make a logical leap that government can&#x27;t be improved.<p>>The problem is that a government&#x27;s primary objective turns into maintaining economic growth, at all costs, even by use of force. This is the core of the criticism in the article.<p>The government&#x27;s primary objective is to stay in power. If it&#x27;s primary purpose was purely economic growth, they&#x27;d be going crazy on Keynesian spending, as many eastern countries do to prop up growth. The US government hasn&#x27;t done much at all in the last 6 years to prop who growth at any cost (unless you count grid lock and inaction as &quot;at all costs&quot;). And European nations wouldn&#x27;t be implementing austerity policies if their goals were growth at any cost. This is a vast simplification of the motivations of the political. If you want to see &quot;growth at any cost&quot; look at Chinese domestic spending.<p>The Western electorate is far more sensitive to unemployment, inflation, or benefit cuts than it is to abstract notions of &quot;growth&quot;. Throughout most of the &quot;great recession&quot;, GDP growth has been positive, yet no one is happy, because voters don&#x27;t vote based on quarterly GDP growth, and attempts to maximize that variable hurt others that politicians care about.<p>That&#x27;s why the Federal Reserve is now doing nomimal unemployment targeting instead of only fighting inflation.<p>I mean, I fail to understand what your primary philosophy is.

They changed the product mix.&quot;</i> sounds like you&#x27;re dismissing the margin change.<p>Overall gross margin is a blend of all your products, that gross margin is where you get the money for everything you do, pay salaries, buy capital equipment, etc. So it really doesn&#x27;t matter if your margin is lower because you are shipping more inexpensive product (the mix), all that matters is that its lower. That changes the amount of revenue you must have to run the business and increases downside risk if you are close to the edge (as Dan Warmenhoven is famous for saying, you have much more control over margin than you do over revenue).<p>In the case of the iPad Mini it says that additional growth in the Tablet market is in the lower margin segment. That is accretive if you&#x27;re holding on to your existing market share at the high end, and dilutive if you&#x27;re losing high end share to the mid-range or bargain products. Same with phones, lets say the 5C turns out to be &quot;good enough&quot; and sales of the 5S plummet because it&#x27;s extra cost (and margin) isn&#x27;t &quot;valuable&quot; enough to the consumer to pay the extra money. Now you have to sell a lot more units to get the same profit, but that requires more &quot;business&quot; (and by that I mean more assemblers, more sales people, more trucks driving around, more logistics, etc.) You lower the price (which increases sales rate, but that also reduces margin, so you have to sell more to make the same amount.<p>Now I don&#x27;t think Apple is anywhere near any of that, they are a very strong company with a solid brand. My observation  is that the reduction in overall gross margin will come out of the business, whether it fewer product managers for more products, or lower salaries for retail staff, or what, the numbers have to balance.",1383013096

Jokes aside, 3840x2160 is fairly breathtaking.  It is quite choice.  If you have the means...<p>3. Only $700.  Sure, that&#x27;s still not as low as a 3840x2160 display would be today had the living room television not converged with the desktop computer monitor, infecting our workspace with the taint of <i>HD</i>.  But it&#x27;s not $4,000, so that&#x27;s something to celebrate.  And, lo, it&#x27;s cheaper than a name-brand 30&quot; display.  It makes me want to shake Dell, HP, and Samsung fiercely until they admit they&#x27;ve been price-fixing 30&quot; because desktop-be-damned.<p>4. It&#x27;s sufficiently large to be nearly immersive, which is something I really want for my desktop environment.  I want to be able to completely fill my field of view with very high-density pixels.  VR goggles need not apply, yet.<p>5. It&#x27;s fairly lightweight and thin.  Something bothersome about desktop monitors is that, unlike televisions, they are manufactured with serious heft.  Nothing about an LCD should require a four-inch cabinet depth, but there it is in every one of my U3011s.  For shame, Dell.  The Chinese have shown you up.  Of course all laptop displays since the early 2000s have done the same.<p>6. The bezel is fairly trim at about 1.5cm.  Trimmer than my U3011s.<p>7. While it&#x27;s glossy, it&#x27;s not offensively glossy like some consumer monitors.<p>8. 3840x2160 for $700.  Why not, right?  Right.  RIGHT.<p>Downsides:<p>1. It&#x27;s a television.  It&#x27;s got speakers.  Yeah, no kidding.  And a remote control!  Very well, I&#x27;ll just stow that in a drawer somewhere.  But more onerous than these features I&#x27;ll never use are the &quot;features&quot; that are not features at all, such as a 5 second <i>SEIKI</i> splash screen when you turn on the monitor.  No, monitor, don&#x27;t do that to me.  Just wake up and let&#x27;s get to business.  Oh, I forgot, you&#x27;re a television.  That also explains why you just <i>turn off</i> when you lose the signal on the HDMI connector, not to re-awaken when the HDMI warms up again.<p>2. It&#x27;s a Seiki.  Yes, they deserve huge amounts of credit for kicking the collective ass of the incumbent manufacturers.  Thank you Seiki!  But also, it means it&#x27;s not exactly the finest engineering around.  The backlighting is uneven and the materials are second-rate.  The back is utilitarian.  Incumbent manufacturers at least fashion some fairly nice looking plastic bits and bobs on the back side of monitors.  But so be it.  I&#x27;m not buying the monitor as a piece of furniture.<p>3. The power buttons are very crunchy/clicky hard buttons on the back side.  Since you have to click one of those every time you sit down (due to HDMI not awakening the monitor), I worry that eventually the button will break.<p>4. Most importantly, it&#x27;s HDMI 1.4 and not HDMI 2.0.  This means at the showcase 3840x2160 resolution, you&#x27;re going to get 30Hz30 frames per second.  This causes a notably sluggish feeling to animation and mouse control.  It&#x27;s serviceable for getting work done and consumption of Facetube content.  My wife doesn&#x27;t play games, so she is tolerating it.  If Seiki drops HDMI 2.0 into a next-generation of this monitor, I&#x27;m grabbing one.<p>5. Yeah, it&#x27;s 39&quot;.  I&#x27;d prefer to see this resolution at something closer to 30&quot;, thereby increasing pixel density.  Better still, I&#x27;d like a 50&quot; display that cranks something closer to 8,000 by 5,000.  I can dream, no?<p>6. Windows 8.1 is <i>NOT</i> (I cannot emphasize this enough) engineered to work with high-density large form-factor desktop displays.  Metro apps are a joke on my 30&quot; displays and they&#x27;re a tragedy on my wife&#x27;s monitor.  Metro Skype at 39&quot; is ... I am at a loss for words ... you have to see it to believe how idiotic it is.  Further ranting at [1].  Similarly, it&#x27;s not touch-enabled.<p>7. It&#x27;s glossy.

There is a common misalignment of values, between that which is &#x27;practical&#x27; and that which is &#x27;right&#x27;. You see this with arguments about such things as safe injecting rooms or wahtever.<p>I think this is a great practical solution. They are not being rewarded with a free product (they have that already), they are being rewarded with shame and/or understanding.<p>The shame of being caught out may make them stop stealing. The understanding may encourage them to stick with the product and buy when they do have the money, or recommend it to others. Win / win solutions are rare and beautiful and should not be discarded for spurious moral values.",1383012386

They take random screenshots while you work. I actually grew to appreciate it and found my work ethic to be improved. In the context of our company, we all worked remotely, kept in touch via IM/cam and email, and the monitoring apps were a way to keep everyone honest and committed while having a very long leash day-to-day. Managers (I was one of them) had access to screenshots but we rarely if ever reviewed them, except in cases prior to a firing (and often not even then). A dedicated, small team reviewed the screenshots and asked for refunds from their pay if they were on non-work related things. Often the managers were never notified unless the violations were extreme.<p>A sidenote, we were all contractors and most of us were freelancers essentially, so we were all easy to fire on a moment&#x27;s notice. It kept teams strong and kept people from resenting their co-workers who couldn&#x27;t keep up. And re-organizing/growing teams was easy, because firing _and_ hiring were so easy. I could do both without any management or peer approval.",1383012386

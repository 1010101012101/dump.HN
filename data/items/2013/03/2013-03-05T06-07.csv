5323322,comment,5320189,5322796,1,0,latchkey,,,"The hard part for me to understand is that I've got way more than just a single file. I've got hundreds of coffee script files for a rather complex nodejs/express app.<p>I start it up with something like this:<p><pre><code>  nodemon -w . lib/start/web.coffee

  or in production:

  coffee lib/start/web.coffee
</code></pre>
That web.coffee file then require's a chain of files.<p>If I try to compile the source maps for all of my files first, using something like this:<p><pre><code>  mkdir .compile
  coffee -m --output .compile --compile ./
</code></pre>
In the .compile folder, there is a few oddly named subdirectories (d, b, rands, sc) with the compiled .js files in there and the respective .map files. This seems to totally break my require chain.<p>Since I don't normally pre-compile all my coffee script files, I just run them directly using nodemon or coffee, how can I work the maps into my dev process?",1362466690

If your goods are not delivered, or if what you ordered was nothing like what was promised, the escrow service would simply send your bitcoins back to you, instead of sending them to the merchant who tried to defraud you.<p>These services would likely charge a transaction fee for the service.<p>Even silk road offers an escrow service that is apparently effective enough. The scammers on silk road typically try to con you into closing the transaction before delivery of any goods, so one red flag that you may be looking at a scammer is a number of early settled transactions in their history.<p>If someone wanted to do something like this more mainstream, they could develop a third party bitcoin escrow service that offered an order history, rating or feedback system, and transaction comments from both parties. You could even develop a rating score formula similar to a credit score, where older accounts with more history, have higher scores, which make it much harder for scammers to use throw away accounts.",1362465074

You're limiting yourself to the period following its expansion and then claiming it hasn't expanded very much since then.<p>I'm using the period since 1960-1970 because the character of the economy hasn't changed very much since then. Yes, the federal government was a lot smaller in say 1900, but at that time 40% of the population lived on a farm, versus almost nobody today. The appropriate size and scope of government for an agrarian society is not the same as for a burgeoning industrial society is not the same as for a mature service-oriented society.<p>> Privatizing the inefficiency doesn't make it go away.<p>Complaining that the government is big and that the government has inefficient policies are two separate complaints. The fact is that once you take out parts of the government budget that are simply taking in checks from one group of people and getting them to another group of people, government expenditures have actually been shrinking relative to GDP. Now, income redistribution may be a problem, but I'd argue it's a separate problem to ""government is too big.""<p>> Local programs have greater accountability and can be better tailored to the different needs of local populations.<p>This is a theoretical trope that is almost wholly not bourne out by actual facts. In practice what happens is that there is far less attention paid to local politics, which means that local government programs can get extremely dysfunctional before anybody starts paying attention. There is pretty much not a single state government that's as well-run as the federal government (except e.g. VA and MD, but its easy to be well-run when you're massively subsidized by the defense budget). A lot of that is due to the fact that state governments get far less scrutiny.<p>>  the cost of such things is born by a more concentrated set of taxpayers who are consequently more likely to demand accountability and shut down wasteful programs<p>C.f. San Francisco.<p>> ""It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."" -Louis Brandeis<p>Yet the history of federalism has been that the only experiments states are interested in running are how to suppress minority groups and women.",1362464784

In my opinion, ADHD is often a fuzzy diagnosis, but I would say that I'm legitimately classified as someone with mild ADHD.  Many of my closest friends have also been people with ADHD, and we've talked a lot amongst ourselves over the years about the effects of the drug.  I've noticed a lot of patterns, and determined my own set of best practices:<p>- Take your adderall in the morning.  If you take adderall later in the day, it can affect your sleep schedule.  If you don't sleep well, you may find yourself wanting to take more adderall to compensate for your lack of sleep the next day, and so begins a snowball effect that inevitably ends with a crash, and a net a loss of productivity.<p>- Extended release works better for me, and it has much less addictive potential than ""instant release.""<p>- Determine your personal minimum effective dose.  Don't trust what the doctor happens to prescribe you to be the precisely perfect dose for you.  There is most certainly a point of diminishing returns for net productivity gains.  Higher doses have higher side effects.<p>- There are social consequences.  If you'll allow me a moment of hippie speak, I'd say that adderall makes your mind resonate at a different frequency than that of regular humans.  It's not so easy to establish rapport when you're not even operating on the same frequency.<p>- Long-term productivity gains for what I'll call production tasks is questionable.  For boring work that just needs to get done, suck it up and just do it.  Learn the Pomodoro technique, and improve your general capacity to focus by practicing meditation (if you have mild ADHD like me - I can't speak for people who have moderate or severe ADHD).<p>- Adderall works for me as an excellent tool for expanding production capability.  If you have a repetitive business task that you can potentially automate, adderall works very well to help you think through automating it.<p>Due to the social side effects and my dislike for the inevitable down cycles (end of the day or off days) associated with regular use, I currently limit myself to use once a week.  I use it ONLY to organize my week ahead of time, and to increase my production capability (learned this phrasing from Stephen Covey) by automating repetitive tasks.  This is the system I've settled on after 7 years of trying different routines.<p>I could really say a lot more my experience with this drug, but alas I'm not on it right now :)  If anyone has more questions I'm happy to follow up.",1362464764

This was during a time that I was building a business that was gaining traction. As an engineer I felt my management skills and understanding of business had serious holes all over the place.  I didn't have time to go back to school.  I had to run a business.  So, I resorted to reading business books.  At one point My wife made the comment that things had changed because there were stacks of business books everywhere now instead of engineering books. It was a really frustrating phase for me.  I learned a lot but, at the same time, a lot of it sounded like highly refined bullshit to me.  I was far more comfortable looking at business from the perspective of mathematical equations and a series of hypothesis to be tested via a scientific process.<p>Eventually I got tired of the bullshit.  Read three authors and get ten different opinions.  Not one of them ever built anything or risked anything at all.  These people were not my people.<p>I started to devote more time to getting together with other entrepreneurs and swapping notes.  It was amazing to me how solutions to problems presented themselves almost without effort in this context.  Sure, talk to people who are really holding a cat by the tail and they might just know a thing or two that the escapes the consultant's artificial construct. I had some of the most amazing and revealing conversations with successful entrepreneurs who had barely finished high-school and hated to read books --any books.

How many of these came out of the minds and work of consultants and MBA's?  How many came out of the efforts of entrepreneurs of all walks of life and levels of education hell-bent to make it happen?<p>So, again please, why do we follow these false prophets?",1362464491

I know cites and dates, direct flights only. Even before getting married and having a kid, I generally think about where and when I want to travel well before I start searching online. I don't know if other people are more spontaneous than I am, but I am constrained by PTO days, other people's schedules, etc. At the most I want the flexibility to change the leave/return dates by a day or two.<p>Since I already know the parameters of my trip, I find that the input that most travel sites have settled on (To, From, Include nearby airports, Leave date, Return date) gets me to what I'm looking for faster. The open-endedness of the Adioso search box was actually slower, since I tended to type too little and did a lot of filtering afterwards. It felt like my choices are either I type too much and the computer doesn't understand, or I type too little and ""fix it myself"".<p>From my biased perspective, I think it would be a big win to have the traditional search inputs be the default but with the open-ended search as an alternative input (not ""Advanced search"" but maybe the link is ""I'm flexible""). As an alternative search, it's no longer a limiting search but it now feels like: you can type <i>anything</i> and the computer just figures it out! Sweet! Also, user education no longer is a problem- everyone knows what to do with an ""I'm flexible"" search box.<p>The other big speed advantage of the traditional search input is: often I will return to a travel site weeks later and my trip details are already pre-filled and all I need to do is hit the search button. You can't really do that with a search box. (When I hit back from the Adioso search results page, I lose everything and the search box is empty. That seems like a bug, I think I should be able to save at least that little bit of typing.)<p>BTW, I didn't feel like Adioso search (getting back the initial results) was slow at all. It felt just as fast as any other travel site and definitely faster than the worst of them that leave you staring at airplane animations for 10s of seconds.<p>Great work, I'm really interested to see what happens with Adioso.

Something might be moving, as Google added &quot;App Ops&quot; [1] (hidden by default, but it&#x27;s there) in Android 4.3, which allow you to revoke permissions from applications.<p>That said, there are some alternatives to Cyanogenmod&#x27;s Incognito mode, which should work better.<p>One is XPrivacy [2], which relies on the XPosed Framework [3]. This is what I&#x27;m currently using on my Android phone. You can allow/restrict some permissions by default, and then have a whitelist for certain applications.<p>Another one is OpenPDroid [4], which requires you to patch your rom (there are some preset for the biggest roms, so usually it&#x27;s just a matter of a few clicks). I haven&#x27;t used it, but it should work just like XPrivacy.<p>XPrivacy and OpenPDroid send blank/fake data instead of blocking applications from using certain APIs, so they cause way less crashes. They even allow you to choose the fake data to provide, so that you can fake, for example, your location.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/07/25/app-ops-android-4-3s-hidden-app-permission-manager-control-permissions-for-individual-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/07/25/app-ops-android-4-3s...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2098156"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2098156</a>",1384617556

6745138,comment,6742033,6744050,5,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"I think the focus on the dichotomy between the header and the body is misguided. If you separate them then an attacker can&#x27;t attack the header using the body, but that&#x27;s just inviting the attacker to find a way to insert data into the header to attack other header fields, or find secrets in the body that shouldn&#x27;t be revealed.<p>Also, it seems like you could get the same benefit as using a separate key and encryption context by just padding the header to a block boundary.<p>The real problem with these attacks is that they aren&#x27;t attacks on the cipher at all. You could be using a one time pad and the attacks would still be effective. What they really are is an attack on content-revealing efficiency. The only defense is to prevent the length of the message from depending on the existence of matches between attacker-supplied plaintext and secrets, and doing that in a way that allows non-cryptographer web developers to not screw it up basically comes down this: You have to disable TLS protocol compression. It exists at the wrong layer of abstraction because the TLS layer doesn&#x27;t know what data is acceptable to compress against what other data.<p>But you still want to use compression, so the compression has to exist at a higher level in the stack, i.e. in HTTP or even HTML, where the web developer can specify exactly which data has come from an untrustworthy source so that it won&#x27;t be compressed against secrets.",1384617361

With local interest rates at 15.5 percent and the krona rising, they decided the smart thing to do, when they wanted to buy something they couldnt afford, was to borrow not kronur but yen and Swiss francs. They paid 3 percent interest on the yen and in the bargain made a bundle on the currency trade, as the krona kept rising. The fishing guys pretty much discovered the trade and made it huge, says Magnus. But they made so much money on it that the financial stuff eventually overwhelmed the fish. They made so much money on it that the trade spread from the fishing guys to their friends...<p>That was the biggest American financial lesson the Icelanders took to heart: the importance of buying as many assets as possible with borrowed money, as asset prices only rose. By 2007, Icelanders owned roughly 50 times more foreign assets than they had in 2002. They bought private jets and third homes in London and Copenhagen. They paid vast sums of money for services no one in Iceland had theretofore ever imagined wanting. A guy had a birthday party, and he flew in Elton John for a million dollars to sing two songs, the head of the Left-Green Movement, Steingrimur Sigfusson, tells me with fresh incredulity. And apparently not very well. They bought stakes in businesses they knew nothing about and told the people running them what to dojust like real American investment bankers!<p><a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/04/iceland200904"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/04/iceland2...</a>",1384614979

6744959,comment,6743358,6744419,8,0,rayiner,,,"There is this attitude, but there is also the other thing: economic and racial social conflict. It cannot be ignored that in California, which has only 6.5% black people, almost 45% of offenders sentenced under three strikes laws are black. Americans not only hate letting people get away with things, but they have particularly little sympathy for policies that disproportionately affect racial minorities. This is the legacy of segregation and suburbanization: it&#x27;s hard to care about what happens to people in other racial and economic demographics when you&#x27;re living in a racially and economically homogenous suburb and never actually encounter these people except to hear in the news about crimes in their communities.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think these attitudes arise because Americans are bad people. America genuinely has a crime problem. London&#x27;s murder rate is about 1.2 per 100,000. Chicago&#x27;s is 15.9 per 100,000, while places like New Orleans and Detroit are around 50-60 per 100k. It&#x27;s not particularly surprising Americans are less sympathetic than Europeans when it comes to punishment.",1384614207

The victims have absolute rights for protection and compassion; but a repeat offender has intentionally chosen to throw away whatever ties with society he had. There&#x27;s a social contract about things we do and don&#x27;t do to each other; we generally don&#x27;t take others stuff, don&#x27;t hurt each others and we show compassion to others in our society - so if you repeatedly choose to break the social contract, by taking others stuff and not showing compassion; then why should others show compassion and refrain from hurting you?<p>If someone can go to my house and take my stuff, why should I be forcibly prevented by police from going to his house and taking his stuff?<p>If someone is an unquestionably repeat offender, then preventing future crimes is a mandatory goal; respecting the offender is important but, if we can&#x27;t do otherwise, it&#x27;s optional. If there is a more humane way to solve it than permanent isolation from society (life sentence, permanent mental institution, execution or exile), then I&#x27;d like to hear that and would greatly support it.",1384614204

This gets worse when screens get installed in remote areas, like we have some screens at Manaus, in the Amazon Forest. There is just no one to support Linux there.<p>- Flash support state in Linux is unknown. Adobe seems to be discontinuing support for flash in Linux, and flash movies cannot be run on the Raspberry Pi or any ARM device.<p>- HTML5 is the next target, but even on Windows the embedded webbrowsers are not up to par yet on performance, in Raspberry Pi it is inviable. It cannot replace 100% Flash yet.<p>- Remote admin support on dynamic IP is great in Windows with Logmein, terrible on other platforms. Yes there&#x27;s TeamViewer on Linux but it seem not too stable, not to say it looks like to be running emulated. Our customers don&#x27;t trust it the way they trust Logmein.<p>That said, we are seeing increased Linux adoptions for some markets. If the Qt5 Blink-based webbrowser is more on par in performance with current desktop browsers, than the adoption may rise a lot.<p>EDIT: fix newlines",1384614008

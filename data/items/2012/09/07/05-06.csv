4487809,story,,,1,0,nshankar,"Sharing success with HN:",,"Yesterday, my boss called me to say, the project you were building looks to be over and we would like if the team shifts to new projects. This is after our project processes over 100,000 image based financial transactions every day in one of the top 3 markets of the world.<p>I am thrilled to share this success and what exactly made us complete the job. I work as a senior manager in a software development team that developed the application suite.<p>First, the team:<p>The project has 8 different, big software (some Windows desktop and rest Web (mark W) applications. It has taken us 4 years to build but with only a programmer staff of 8-9 with no tester. The programmer had an average experience of 2-3 years (we could afford only this small experience) and no domain experience.<p>The only thing that succeeded here is my emphasis to make every programmer a product manager for the product he oversees. This programmer has a free run but complete responsibility of the product. He is present in every SDLC phase all the time. \nI have never indulged in the efforts he is taking but the outcome he is achieving. I emphasized over the thrill of building something awesome.<p>Second and equally important:<p>We used Microsoft stack. We don't use any thing other than bare minimum Microsoft to build our products. We don't use any version management system and testing tools. We have never tweaked the IIS, MS SQL server. We have used it the way it has been given by software manufacturer.<p>There is nothing like Microsoft products when it comes to ""It works - with minimum effort"". What we think of Apple in terms of hardware products is true of Microsoft for software development products.<p>I use Linux for my personal aspirations and love my hacking. But, when it comes to building mission critical applications in short time with a small bunch of staff, I must admit Linux is no small job, though Linux comes entirely free.",1346996351

I wrote the following after having used my Kindle Keyboard for a few weeks:<p><i>Whats really remarkable about the device is how relaxing it is to use. ... The e-ink screen, at the cost of some functionality and elegance, is not only relaxing to the eyes, but also completely kills the low-grade but omnipresent anxiety of a touch screen. Which means you dont have to worry about triggering a destructive action by accidentally brushing the screen somewhere and grip-placement is a lot less restrictive, i.e. if its most comfortable to hold by a corner of the actual screen, you can. The physical buttons mean that you know for sure when youve made an input. And the incredible battery life means I have literally never had to think about charging the device. I plug it in to sync to Instapaper (more on this later) often enough that Ive never even come close discharging the whole battery, even on long trips.

The bank re-evaluates their criteria for merchant accounts and/or develops new products with which to serve the demand for merchant accounts.<p>But the status quo seems to me like a situation in which an entrepreneur can't start an honest corporation without putting his kids' college savings at risk of highly unpredictable fraud loss.

And I think some of the people reading this have a consistently strong motivation to provide for their wives and children.<p>Sure, there are times in everyone's life when one needs to apply discipline because that is the only way to get something necessary done. And it would be foolish to neglect to apply that discipline and instead to wait for a natural human motivation to do that thing.<p>And sure, the ability to apply discipline is extremely valuable and one should do whatever one can to increase this ability.<p>And I would for example suggest to readers who have not tried it yet to see if strength training causes an increase in their ability to apply discipline <i>even in parts of life that have nothing to do with physical strength or stamina</i> because strength training tends to improve the health of the mitochondria in the muscles, which might improve the health of the mitochondria in the rest of the body, particularly the frontal lobes of the brain, which would tend to increase ability to apply discipline because IIUC the frontal lobes are almost uniquely dependent on an adequate supply of metabolic intracellular energy.<p>I just want to point out to readers that there are now many many sources of information about these matters and to suggest that they be initially skeptical of any new source, particularly if he is selling something or likes giving pep talks.",1346994702

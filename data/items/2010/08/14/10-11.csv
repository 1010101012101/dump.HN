1603235,comment,1603027,1603027,0,0,todayiamme,,,"There is a paragraph in the essay which stood out to me;<p>>>>The irony is that straight men could learn a thing or two from their gay brethren, as Andrew Sullivan implied in his insightful book on the AIDS crisis, Love Undetectable: Notes on Friendship, Sex, and Survival (1998). Often estranged from their natural families and barred from forming legally acknowledged new ones of their own, gay men, Sullivan observed, learned to rely not on the kindness of strangers but the loyalty of friends: “Insofar as friendship was an incalculable strength of homosexuals during the calamity of AIDS, it merely showed, I think, how great a loss is our culture’s general underestimation of this central human virtue.”<<<<p>I've experienced that in my life. The closest people I have are people who have no direct relation through blood with me. This was something really counter-intuitive to me, because I grew up in a country where family is supposed to be paramount, but I discovered that isn't so. I am willing to bet that anyone who has had to deal with forced social isolation be it through abuse, or homelessness will agree.<p>No one taught me that relationships are only as good as <i>the people</i> who compose it. Friendships don't magically happen. You have to work for them, and the cost isn't just time but it is something deeper and more intrinsic to who you are.<p>The smartest thing anyone could have ever said is that love is a verb. To love someone involves making ""sacrifices"" at one level or the other for the sake of the relationship, and most people are unwilling to do that. They don't realize that you can't have your cake and eat it too.<p>I think that this is the reason why most people, not just in the USA, think it's cool to be alone. They tend to desire instant results, which simply isn't possible.",1281783585

1603229,comment,1602975,1603083,0,0,jrockway,,,"Well, there are no twin-engine sport planes; you have to get a regular private pilot's license and then get a multi-engine rating.<p>Having an extra engine doesn't mean you are going to survive an engine failure.  If you don't react quickly to the failure, you're in trouble.  And remember, although a multi-engine plane decreases the chance of all engines failing, it increases the chance of <i>an</i> engine failing.  So you increase your risk of Something Bad happening.  People don't fly multi-engine light aircraft for safety, they do it for better performance.  (AFAIK, anyway.)<p>Single-engine planes have quite good glide ratios, and there are a lot of good places to land them.  Try it in the simulator some time.",1281783280

1603224,comment,1602744,1602744,0,0,Tycho,,,"Point 8 seems a bit unfair - the proof author's comments to me seemed to be 'confirmations of receipt' have started arriving (not confirmations of validation) and 'as you know this problem has philosophical ramifications' (not 'I have forever changed the philosophical landscape'). Otherwise seems like a neat article, maybe I should memorize the other points, could come in handy at dinner parties (cause I, like a lot of other people over the last week, don't know wtf any of this mathematical stuff really means).",1281782881

I've been doing the 3 things on your list for the better part of 10 years now, and I've never been wealthy.<p>3. Living on the road is no more expensive than living anywhere else.  Less usually, since there's no rent or car payment involved.  I can live large in Thailand for $500/month.<p>2. Living on the beach, I once calculated that I needed to bill <i>one day per month</i> to break even.  Anything above that went into savings.  That leaves 29 days a month to do whatever you like.<p>1. During those 29 days per month, I work for either a.) myself or b.) nobody.  Maybe once a year I'll take a short contract, pull in 20k or whatever, and repeat for another year.<p>And that's just the level of effort needed for subsistence.  Any money earned above that goes straight in to the ""retirement"" fund, in quotes because frankly I consider myself retired today.",1281780131

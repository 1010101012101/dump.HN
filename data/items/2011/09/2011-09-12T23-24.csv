2989391,comment,2986379,2986617,2,0,buff-a,,,"Sorry. I meant someone who has a legal residence in Manhattan, pays US taxes, US social, but actually spends 350 days of the year ""vacationing"" in Mumbai, Buenos Aires, etc? And by ""legal residence"" I mean paying $100 a month to a mate to collect my mail and occasionally crash on his couch. Believe me, the IRS will back me up when I claim to be a US resident, as will New York State, and they would penalize balsamiq if balsamiq tried to claim otherwise.<p>So what matters? Is it the <i>law</i>? Or is it the <i>spirit</i>? Is it the quality of work or the location where the person was at the time they did the work?<p>What if the Mumbai resident comes to a conference in SF. Do you pay them SF rates for that week? What if they come for a month? Six months?<p>This may seem like I'm looking for (what we call in video games) an exploit. I am of course. But so is balsamiq. It wants to have lower salary costs. It could pay everyone the same, no matter where they live. But it knows that Mumbai residents can't up and move to SF. So it claims to be fair (if they moved we would pay them more!) but the reality is that it knows they cant.<p>I'm not saying I have a better idea. But I'm not the one blogging about it.",1315871991

2989388,comment,2987429,2988018,2,0,eddie_catflap,,,"I'm in a similar position to you, although I'm almost nine years down the line. I've spent most of my thirties raising a family and climbing the corporate tech ladder, doing jobs which didn't really interest me but paid reasonably well. I too have seen opportunities and ideas go to waste because I didn't think there was time to concentrate on them as well as home life etc. What didn't click was that I was spending so many hours at work that home life was suffering anyway. I'm now doing what I can on my own ventures and cutting back on extra obligations for my (full time) job. Previously I'd be the first guy to roll up my sleeves and pull a 24 hour session at work to fix an issue. Not now (although needs must on occasion).<p>Having an understanding partner can help. My wife is supportive of my efforts as we both realise that despite being financially comfortable at the moment, we will never be rich and I will never be completely satisfied carrying on in my current or similar roles. And who knows what will happen in the next 30 years? I may spend most of those out of work, unable to get a job due to my age. A fear of regretting never even having tried is a big motivator for me.<p>As others have said here, there is time to be found. Cut down on the TV. Don't work such long hours for other people. Get up an hour earlier than everyone else, especially at weekends. What I've found is that simply by doing 'stuff', I've become more efficient and more productive with the time I have. Ideas seem to be flowing more easily now as well. You can do it. Good luck.",1315871912

2989385,comment,2989087,2989087,30,0,BrandonMTurner,,,"I was an active developer of ReactOS for about the time period of 2003-2007, including acting as the release engineer for the project for 2 years.<p>I feel like I can speak from unique stand point as I saw everything from the inside.<p>ROS is a lot of things, but one thing it is NOT is production ready.<p>From what I can tell, not a lot in the process has changed since I left.  I am sure a lot of things code wise have changed but not enough to make a marginal difference.<p>One of the biggest issues ROS faces is the lack of testers.  Since it can't be used a production OS very few people will actually test it.  When I was there, we had 2 dedicated testers.  For a whole operating system, that will not cut it.<p>Another issue is with driver compatibility.  While it is true that it runs good on emulated hardware, it has a long long way to go before actual Windows drivers let it run on actual hardware.  One small thing in the driver can cause everything to stop working.  And with only ~20 active developers at the time, there is a finite set of hardware that can be debugged on.  Not to mention only 3-4 of the 20 developers were skilled enough to fix issues with device drivers.<p>ROS is also fighting uphill battle by chasing Windows when Windows has 100s of developers working on it.  I left ROS and worked for Microsoft for two years so I also know how much faster MSFT is going then ROS.  Though, even if they got to full XP compatibility it would be one of the most impressive feats I have ever seen of open source, I just don't see it happening anytime soon.<p>And finally, the last main issue with ROS is the developers itself.  There was so few dedicated, we only had ~30 people with write permissions.  Of those, only 15 were active.  And those 15 were all working in their own area.  I worked in shallow (read: non complex) Win32 API and user applications (cmd.exe, control panel, etc...).  But everyone had their own section they were interested in and they worked at their own pace with little to no oversight. You either need focus/vision or resources to make real technical progress on a project this large.  Without one of those you have no chance.  And ROS didn't have either.<p>All that said, I loved working on ROS.  It taught me how to write real code and I learned way more from working on ROS then I did getting my degree.  The people on a personal level were great, and some of them were the most technically sound developers I have ever met.  Sadly, a whole OS is being carried on their back.",1315871884

2989334,comment,2987654,2988125,1,0,malbs,,,"We are currently building some core infrastructure with MongoDB. I looked at Riak, but it was capped collections and ad-hoc querying that really nailed it for us. Riak is a great product, I loved it's replication mechanism where any node was writable, but we didn't require that, so we went with mongo.<p>We had a 3 node system across a wan, where local clients would read from a local node, and if they needed to write, would write to the master across the wan. The issue we had was there was a significant amount of data being written to the master that one or two of the nodes weren't interested in 100% of the time, but it was still being replicated across the wan (and at cost)<p>so I investigated how the replication mechanism worked - to see if I could gain greater control over what data was replicated. As it turns out, there isn't, but you can emulate the replication yourself if you're interested. Well this is how we did it:<p>- master node has a capped collection (we call db.messages)\n- slave nodes have a bit of mongo console javascript that execute tailed cursor querying for messages being inserted\n- when a message that matches the query inputs is inserted into the messages collection, it gets inserted into a local db.files collection, which clients then read from<p>The added bonus is that occasionally we do need to replication additional data to particular nodes, so we just craft up a tailed cursor query that finds any messages we can, and pulls them across the wire<p>we make a fair bit of use of the adhoc querying in mongodb, so that was a massive selling point for us<p>speed was also a major issue - we have a average write/very high read requirement, and it's really really fast.<p>finally the platform was a consideration. We're mostly a windows shop, but we'll use linux where needed, and we were prepared to have riak running on linux if thats what we thought was bets, but it just didn't really fit for us.<p>the only downside was we use Delphi, and the existing Delphi drivers were.. not good, so we wrote our own, which I'm trying to negotiate with my boss so we can push onto github.<p>good luck!",1315870901

I personally liked that as it provided exposure to procedural, functional and OO programming.  C is also great for getting that low level view of the world, the lack of which I guess is what Joel was railing against.  The thing is, it doesn't matter what your primary teaching language is, it just matters that you get exposed to a wide variety of development styles and levels of abstraction so you see how they differ.

That's the point. Hiring practices that select for cognitive ability are restricted (through the threat of litigation) <i>entirely</i> because of the incidental racial impact of these practices. The court's criterion for disparate impact is not socioeconomic, it is racial. That is why I brought up race.<p>Also, I disagree with your general thesis that race is never a worthwhile topic for consideration in discussions such as this. The fact is that race is a real sociological phenomenon in and of itself, and not merely a proxy for socioeconomic markers. There are many instances where race actually would be worth bringing into a discussion, even if you feel this isn't one of them. What's more, I don't see how bringing up race ""wrecks the discussion,"" except when it results in overly-PC people coming out of the woodwork to shout you down.",1315869333

This actually exposes the sham Wheeler has orchestrated. If one is flimsy, then so is the other, and he seems to understand both are flimsy, but he protects his commercially reasonable rate rule, while fights against the unreasonable discrimination one, because he thinks the latter may actually be <i>less</i> flimsy than the former, and he knows carriers wouldn&#x27;t like that. So he doesn&#x27;t want people to start pushing for that one instead.<p>That&#x27;s not the only way to bring net neutrality, though. Reclassifying ISPs are common carriers would do that, too, and I think it would also be much easier to have small ISPs come and use Comcast or whoever&#x27;s cables, and therefore more competition, too.

7690998,comment,7683953,7686183,1,0,waps,,,"You don&#x27;t get it. The entirety of (current) leftist ideology falls apart if force is ever used on any large scale. So &quot;it can&#x27;t happen&quot;, right ?<p>The same goes for intelligentsia&#x27;s hate for violenc. Keep history in mind, intelligentsia will order &quot;their&quot; forces to do horrible things on their behalf against defenseless people, but touching a weapon themselves, no no no no no. What should be understood is that they have nothing against violence. They just want the guarantee that the plebs can&#x27;t use violence against them, and that they, personally, can never be forced to commit violence, so they cannot be directly blamed for things, even things that are obviously their fault. Like, say, you will not find a single French philosopher accepting responsibility for the French revolution&#x27;s aftermath, despite the fact that they were very, very much responsible for it.<p>What should be understood as well is that figures like Gandhi epitomize this behaviour. He&#x27;s commonly misunderstood. He&#x27;s a very religious Hindu man from a Brahmin family. His hatred for violence does NOT come from a desire for peace (no more than any other human, he wants a peaceful city to live in, like anyone else, but he certainly does not want peace at any price), it comes from being raised to never, under any circumstances do any work, certainly not manual labour, and certainly not risky work, like committing violence against other human beings. Such a thing would massively lower his karma, it&#x27;d be like forcing a jew to celebrate his birthday with a pig barbecue. He has, however, ordered large numbers of both soldiers and civilians to commit violence on others, or threaten them, he even ordered genocides. And even more often, he has often created or contributed to situations that he knew perfectly well would erupt in violence. He is at least partially responsible for the tens of millions of deaths during India&#x27;s partition.<p>This person is celebrated by leftists, by the lower ranks because &quot;he is a man of peace&quot; and they can just deny real history because they&#x27;re 15 years old and haven&#x27;t ever touched a history book with more than 50 pages (they also revere complete monsters like Che Guevara of course). The higher ranks are well aware of history, yet they love him for his cunning use of violence. How he caused huge battles while moving his forces right under the nose of the enemy. How he created situations that got millions of muslims killed (in revenge for what they did - not saying there wasn&#x27;t any justification) without ever ordering anyone to fire a gun (he did make sure they had more guns than the enemy of course). How he kept getting his way by creating situations that were completely intolerable for his enemy, e.g. preventing villages from getting food, preventing government departments from operating by cutting communications, destroying the means of escape for refugees by sabotaging train lines, ... Thereby forcing his adversaries to start the attack, usually at a disadvantage. But he is no more a man of peace than Adolf Hitler, and for the same reason. Which is another reason they revere him. This guy killed millions, maybe more than Hitler ever did, because they disagreed with his ideology. He did so without so much as ordering a single person killed. And of course, they revere him because he won.<p>No matter how pure your leftist ideology, you will be skinned alive by intelligentsia if you don&#x27;t achieve leftist policy being imposed. E.g. the kibbutzim movement in Israel is widely reviled by leftists ? Why ? I&#x27;ve never met people more dedicated to living as leftist ideology dictates. They failed to take over Israel, that&#x27;s why. Their failures made Israel a more rightist state than any rightist politician could ever have achieved.<p>Violence, arms and people choosing for themselves is just completely and utterly incompatible with leftist ideology on pretty much any level you can imagine.<p>Leftist policy, enforced sharing, massive government expansion, ... can only work if it&#x27;s imposed from above by a privileged group of rulers (and intelligentsia would quickly leave leftism if this ever changes). But it&#x27;s not just that. Generally leftism requires that large scale violence doesn&#x27;t exist, or doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>For example, obviously if war threatening America is a real risk, then a large well-funded military is an investment you can&#x27;t seriously criticize.<p>If a large internal threat is possible, whether government or otherwise, then you can&#x27;t argue against gun ownership. Hell, you might even advocate a DUTY to bear arms, something along the line of what Switzerland does [1]. You should see foreigners panic to the most normal of things there : someone comes to work with an assault rifle in his backpack, casually put beneath their desk, lots of ammunition in the same bag, because they leave for mandatory training that evening. Not easy on American nerves that one, let me tell you.<p>Generally most big government policies would never succeed if there is a serious risk of a large part of the population resisting force. Which is of course exactly the point of the second amendment, but a byproduct is that it makes leftist policies very, very hard to implement.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland</a>",1399128679

Both are difficult; running puts a lot of strain on your body as it counters forces several times its own weight 180 times a second.  Good for your bones, if you can handle it.  Swimming is less strain, but the equipment is very, very expensive.  If you can only do it once a week, you&#x27;re never going to get good enough to enjoy it.<p>For that reason, I recommend cycling.  It&#x27;s lower impact than running, and less expensive than swimming.  What I like is that you can choose the exact level at which you want to exert yourself.  Want to train at 75% max heart rate?  Type in the number and pedal less hard if you&#x27;re over, and pedal harder if you&#x27;re under.  Easy.  (Modulo traffic and pedestrians.)<p>I like running and everything, but I weigh about 15 pounds too much to not hurt myself every time I go out.  So cycling it is.",1399128412

The argument really breaks down if you try to call this all laissez-faire capitalism. There has been nothing &quot;hands off&quot; about our government&#x27;s handling of the economic infrastructure.

Here is the relevant part of my otherwise short reply:<p><i>Google follows what I believe to be unethical business practices – including, but not limited to, condoning censorship, invading their users’ privacy,</i> [publishing] <i>proprietary software, and making available and encouraging the use of network services with far too little user control of the programs.</i><p>A little more than a year later, Kragen Javier Sitaker wrote this, which I thought was the best explanation of why one wouldn’t want to work for Google:<p><a href=""http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2011-August/000938.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2011-August/...</a>",1399125876

All of my friends spent several weeks working on the coding exercises got into Google (for those cared to apply). Several of them are really not that &quot;smart&quot; and they are below-average in project-coding & general computer science understanding (sorry my friends), but repeatedly working on coding exercises and even memorize some common problems&#x27; solution just works for Google or Facebook&#x27;s hiring process.<p>That process of cracking the coding exercises can be boring, though. I would be immediately returning to do my side-project even after I do one or two coding exercise. Not worth of the time at least for me; there are tons of great companies packed with people smarter than the average Googlers and they don&#x27;t emphasize on algorithm in hiring process that much, why not work for them?",1399125864
7690784,comment,7689579,7690574,1,0,garyrob,,,"I agree with you. Denying the existence of qualia makes no sense to me, except as the result of psychological processes. When you have to believe something in order to hold on to other cherished beliefs, there is a strong human tendency to do so, whether it&#x27;s consistent with obvious evidence or not. A lot of mankind&#x27;s tendency to believe in religions can be explained that way. So can Dennet&#x27;s denial of qualia. (Ironic, in view of Dennet&#x27;s view of religion.)",1399125863

Also, IIRC only Yesod provides incremental builds, no? With SBT incremental builds most code changes incur a < 1 second recompilation hit.<p>As for the IDE story, the secret to a performant Scala IDE is to <i>turn off automatic builds in Eclipse</i> and let SBT run the show. With the SBT eclipse plugin there&#x27;s a setting that allows SBT compilation target and Eclipse target to be shared so you never have to clean/build in Eclipse -- this is a huge win, the difference between standard dog slow Eclipse performance, and snappy, oh this is real nice if only the haters knew, joy ;-)",1399125813

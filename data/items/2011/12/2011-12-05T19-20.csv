3316201,comment,3315931,3315931,13,0,dylanpyle,,,"Having worked extensively on a project that used something similar (we switched from Titanium Desktop to Mozilla's Chromeless project over the course of the dev cycle) as an underlying technology, I see a few things this needs to address. There IS a valuable niche here - Chromeless and Titanium are the only real competitors - and neither are solving it particularly well (though both slightly nicer than Appify as it currently stands).<p>First: Lower-level APIs. That means I need Javascript hooks into file access, menu bar content, cross-domain requests, camera and microphone, etc etc etc. Without this, no meaningful apps can be created.<p>Second: Config. Let me specify the startup window parameters (perhaps using a config JSON file included with the app source). Height, width, and position at least. Maybe support for multiple windows?<p>Third: Support. This one is where Titanium and Chromeless both fall flat on their face. Titanium Desktop is dead; the company has shifted 100% of efforts into an equivalent platform for mobile devices. Things are broken and aren't getting fixed, which makes it unfeasible to use for long-term development. The same applies to Chromeless; I've submitted dealbreaking bugs to the github - things simply Don't Work - and receieved no developer response whatsoever. Again, it seems as if the dev team has lost interest.<p>I really hope that you're planning on pursuing this as more than a one-off github project, because you have the opportunity to dominate an area of the ""app development for web developers"" market that NOBODY is currently solving. Best of luck.<p><i></i>*<p>EDIT: And for all of those who (largely correctly) will claim ""desktop is dead, stop pretending it's the web"" - you're right. The thing is, the project I was working on found ourselves in an interesting position, and we certainly weren't the only ones. We wanted to build a web app, and knew that the web was the future of our product. However, there was functionality we needed (filesystem access, non-flash microphone access, etc etc) that simply doesn't exist (yet!) on the web. Specifications and standards have been proposed and are being implemented, but we unfortunately can't assume that every potential user has a Chrome nightly build. Distributing an app running in an invisible web environment allowed us to develop the code we would be able to use long-term, while giving us a predictable, highly up-to-date, and <i>extensible</i> (via native hooks thru javascript) access to the local machine.<p>Also: cocui looks awesome, and worth checking out. My team has since decided to accept our limitations and move to strictly web, but if I was considering a similar project again I would definitely consider it.",1323115188

But that could just be me."" was an off the cuff remark. I still think Freshdesk is trying to leverage Zendesk's brand but hey, hat's just my opinion. I do note that other folks in here have commented on the similartiies between the two products, I've reached out to Freshdesk asking to ommuncate with them to review their product - am looking forward to comparing them with Zendesk.<p>The image on Freshdesk's site showing a Zendesk post with my name on it actually relates to a CloudCamp that Zendesk was helping to spread the message about earlier this year. I run CloudCamps in aus/nz (for free, as in gratis, voluntary, unpaid). So that image is kind of irrelevant - it's kind of like saying that a Red Cross volunteer is somehow in the pocket of a large corporate that sponsors the Red Cross.<p>That said I did do some writing for Zendesk for their blog - around a year or so ago and not since then.

That sends me to a long-hold on the Home button to find the application again and sometimes this involves starting from scratch and other times I just pickup where I left off. It seems totally random to me.<p>I did not care for the day when my stock-ish Droid X got the MOTOBLUR update. Any OS can be updated in a way that changes a lot of things but it rarely happens with iOS or, from what I've seen, WP7. Basically everything stays the same with some enhancements. This change from stock-ish to MOTOBLUR was a big step backwards and when/if this phone gets ICS it will be another major change.<p>The locked boot-loader situation is chaotic. When I go to buy a new phone I have to study the details of locked vs. encrypted loaders. Checkout forums to see if anyone is developing a stock-ish ROM in case there's another MOTOBLUR type of incident with the carrier provided ROM. Motorola promised to unlock their loaders then just never did it. Obviously now I would go with a Google phone running stock Android instead but that was not an option when I got the Droid X.<p>Battery life is not reliable. Some days I get 6-8 hours and other days its dead by noon. I don't know why this happens. I can't rely on using my Droid X as an alarm clock because occasionally the battery goes from full charge to dead overnight.<p>Random apps in the Android Market are allowed to SPAM me with ads in my notification bar. It feels like a massive invasion of my personal space when this happens. I can't even stress how big of a problem this is for me. I'll stop using any platform that allows this to happen. It's a non-negotiable point. In general I'm also concerned about malware in the Android Market. I don't really install many third party apps anymore. There are things I would like to try out but hitting the install button is a difficult decision.<p>When it comes to games it's total chaos. You have no way of really knowing if the game is going to work correctly or not on your phone. The Droid X isn't all that old yet most games seem to lag on it. It ranges from annoying to unplayable.<p>The lag/jitter of the UI, especially in the stock browser, is just annoying. Some sites scroll fine and others jump around annoyingly. I can't really count on being able to happily use the web browser.<p>My phone reboots a lot. A few times a week at minimum. Something to do with being paired to a Bluetooth device. Bluetooth should never reboot my phone randomly. Never.<p>Every-time I plug my Droid X into my computer two volumes are mounted. The SD card and another Motorola Tools volume. Every single time I have to close the window when it comes up. Annoying.<p>My SD card is littered with all sorts of random files. Trying to find folders on it is pretty difficult. Some of the folders are from apps I deleted long ago. I have to go through every now and again and clean-up all these random folders. Annoying.<p>For other people these things may not be a big deal but they really deeply annoy me. It's not so much that I can't deal with them but just that I don't want to.

3316125,comment,3312517,3312517,1,0,grkhetan,,,"I think the article was good, and Jason tried to be unbiased (he ""tried"", since he has always historically been pro-Android). However I believe an honest comparison between iOS and Android cannot be done in less than 10 pages of indepth review.<p>For example, I believe he missed the following positive points for iOS and iPhone (just my casual thoughts):
1. iPhone 4s is 2 to 3 times faster than Galaxy Nexus in graphics: <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/5133/galaxy-nexus-ice-cream-sandwich-initial-performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/5133/galaxy-nexus-ice-cream-sa...</a>
2. Software update support: The new OS updates are not pushed fast enough to all android phones -- you may have to wait months to get the latest OS release like 4.0 on your phone -- and for most phones, it will actually never be released (apart from Nexus phones which have the best experience in this regard, but when comparing Android you have to look at all phones). Look at this: <a href=""http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphan...</a>
3. Android market apps cannot be fully trusted, since they may be of poor quality or may be malware -- since they have not been reviewed, and also they can access more things on the phone. (with permissions, but most users just say yes to all permissions)
4. Lots of accessories available for the iphone whereas there are so many android phones that accessories available for each phone are much much less.
5. Airplay on iOS can push the screen content and video/audio to speakers/TV via apple tv. This is a really amazing experience -- for example showing your photos and videos to friends on the TV via airplay while flicking back and forth on your iphone/ipad.
6. iCloud Photo stream where your photos are synced automatically, without you having to do anything. Same for documents in the iCloud. iTunes match can upconvert all your music to high quality music, without having to upload it in the first place!
7. Fragmentation issue: Some apps work on some phones, some dont. For example, netflix was not available for most android phones for a long time. Angry birds also started with only a few handsets.
8. Galaxy Nexus is toooo big. iPhone can be used well with one hand with the thumb being able to reach any part of the screen. iPhone's styling and design as well is better -- though that is subjective.
9. One of the best quality support and service available via apple retail store.
10. The amount of quality apps available on the App Store, for everything, like games, music, productivity, etc.
11. Siri may be underwhelming, but still it can handle a lot of tasks much more easily and in much more friendly way than Android.<p>There are many more....
For android also, there would be a list like this.. but I believe the main plus point in favor of android are: free navigation app from Google maps (on iOS, you have to buy one for atleast $20), app-to-app sharing and more customization.",1323114372

The fact is, you don't know what career a person will end up choosing, and math is important (as is art, music, philosophy, chemistry, physics) in a subset of them.

For all we know, there could be dolphins on Titan.

Many visual telescopes, both amateur and professional, stay at 1 degree and less of true field of view for medium and high magnification; 2 degrees true field is already pretty good and it's usually obtained at low magnification.<p>Astrographs can produce wider fields of view, 10 degrees being considered pretty studly, to borrow a quote from Linus. But normally you don't get that ""for free"". You force an optical element to work at such a wide angle, and then correct the inevitable distortions with various correctors, which are usually lenses or combinations thereof.<p>The Kepler mission is essentially a Schmidt camera, an old, true and tested design:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_camera"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_camera</a><p>Its almost 1 meter aperture would allow a theoretical resolving power of almost 0.1 arcsec (which is my full height as an average guy, standing in Los Angeles, as seen from New York), which could be exploited freely in space since there's no atmosphere to reduce it. Unfortunately, for the type of measurements they do, the image is softened intentionally back to 10 arcsec, which is the theoretical resolution of a 1 cm aperture, or the lens in your digital camera (assuming your camera is a true diffraction-limited system, which it very likely isn't). However, the light gathering power of Kepler is, of course, 10k greater than your camera's; and, again, it's unimpeded by messy and light-polluted Earth atmosphere.<p>Sorry for the pop-sci journalism comparisons, but the numbers really are kind of mind-boggling.<p><a href=""http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/QuickGuide/MissionDesign/PhotometerAndSpacecraft/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/QuickGuide/MissionDesign/Phot...</a><p>Please note the curved sensor array, which is due to the fact that a Schmidt scope actually does have a curved field (the light comes to true focus not in a plane, but in a segment of sphere). In fact, flat fields are something you strive for, you don't get for free; even common types of instruments have curved fields, but in most cases the radius of curvature is so big you can ignore it.<p>Optical instruments are tricksy.",1323112953

And if you want to get silly about it, typing and waiting is just neuron activation, and I imagine there is plenty of firing and waiting going on when we remember.<p>If you wish to define human memory as only the information retrieval within our own brain, then there is no argument against your case. However, it raises other questions such as exactly where we set the distinction. Does it mean that the memory must be stored in the biological structure of the brain (meaning whatever we are born with), or just whatever is physically inside our head (maybe one day we can graft memory boosters in there).<p>And what if somehow we train our memories/brains and some external system to be able to cue off each other? Perhaps some sort of direct neural interface where a partial memory and trigger an external stimulus and that then triggers the full memory faster (better?). Then does the external system become an extension of human memory? It may not increase our information storage capacity, but it would improve recall.<p>Anyhow, it's all fun semantics and fantasy at this point. One day...",1309870638

Do it little by little.<p>2) Do research FIRST and find out what people want, and then test 2-3 radical changes. Once you find the best ""radical"" change... you test each individual component.<p>So basically, it's your personal preference.<p>It also depends on the amount of traffic you get. Smaller websites are basically FORCED to do ""screams"" while sites getting thousands of visitors per day can afford to do whispers.<p>The bottom line is... each method has pro's and con's and  works great depending on the circumstance. I know I've personally done both for myself and clients :)<p>Oh and as a ""P.S""... you're definitely NOT throwing spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks.

First, a radically different design is going to have so many differences that you'll never be able to pinpoint which element made the difference. If you're seeing a 10% lift, does that mean you might have gotten rid of something that was working great, and you could have had a 30% lift by just fixing the actual problem? What if the radical new design actually lower sales? Now you have to find out which of the forty-seven changes caused it, or just go back to the old design altogether. That's a lot of unnecessary and expensive work.<p>The second major problem is that by going for ""grand slams,"" you're basically throwing spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks.<p>Instead, take the time to be analytical and form real testable hypotheses about what could make an impact.<p>Jared Spool tells a story in the book ""Web Form Design"" about a checkout process that started with a simple two-field input form asking users to register for an account or login before paying for their purchase. After looking at user data carefully, they found that almost all of their dropoffs were happening right there. They tried moving the login fields to the end of the checkout process instead of the beginning, and saw a 45% conversion increase, over $1.5 million in the first month.<p>A radical redesign wouldn't have fixed the problem - they needed to do user path analysis and give the issue careful thought before deciding where to make the change.<p>It's often a single usability issue that's causing the problems, and you can't find those by changing everything on a page and hoping for the best.",1309868959

Bonds pay out a fixed amount of interest, and so there is no chance of hitting the lottery; with equities, the company stock can skyrocket.<p>Hence bonds are a risk-averse investment, and so bond holders are very jumpy about default.<p>The Greek bonds, IIRC, before the CDS rates (credit default swap: basically a bet on the chance of a bond going into default) started creeping up, were issued at around 3% coupon.  This value is consistent only with a very low perceived risk of serious default by the buyers of bonds.  At the moment, CDS markets are showing a near probability of Greece going into default: the bond rates are artificially low only because of massive government and IMF intervention in the markets.<p>Note also that even after the drastic austerity measures, Greece is still running a budget deficit, so if it defaults, it cannot finance its expenses even in the short term.<p>Greece is small fry, but it is seen as a test case for bigger countries: probably Spain, possibly Italy.  Actually, the situation is worse in Portugal than Greece, since Portugal is also insolvent and has shown nothing like the political resolve that Greece has.  But Portugal is tiny.<p>Many of the banks in wealthier European countries are heavily exposed to PIGS (Portugal-Spain-Ireland-Greece) debt, so expect serious PIGS defaults to be followed by rich country bank crises.  German banks, in particular, are badly exposed to Spanish government debt.  The ""stress tests"" of European banks carried out in 2010 explicitly did not test for sovereign default, presumably to avoid frightening bond holders.",1309868526

I thought it very interesting that Clojure and Scala feature very prominently in the comments, and yet I just heard about them a few months ago.  I feel like I've had my head stuck in the ground.<p>As for codebase size...  Yes, Java is going to have more lines due to the nature of the language.

It doesn't really have all the syntactic sugar that Ruby does.",1309867319

8743203,comment,8742953,8743162,0,0,wycats,,,"For what it&#x27;s worth, a big part of this is slowly winding down earlier commitments over time. I joined TAG a couple years ago, and decided not to run again this year because I had largely achieved my original goals of changing the composition and mission of the TAG, and others can carry the torch forward. I also retired from the Rails team this year after a somewhat-long period of inactivity (from day-to-day decisionmaking) for similar reasons.<p>The closest I can get to a single &quot;secret&quot; is aggressively delegating. What I mean by this is delegating before you feel comfortable delegating. The only way I know of to get everything done that I want to get done is to set the vision for something, do some initial implementation work, and find people who share the vision to help as early as possible. The primary reason I end up working on so many things is that things are way more connected than you might expect, and the full picture of something like Ember involves both day-to-day work on Ember and advocacy around a whole host of related technologies. I&#x27;m very grateful for the number of groups that have welcomed my participation.<p>I got involved in Rust largely because it was the shortest path to a low-overhead, non-crashy agent for Skylight, even counting the work we had to do to keep up with ongoing development over the past year. When getting involved in a technology so early, I tend to get really invested, and try to find holes that I know how to fill and fill them. That&#x27;s what happened with Cargo and a whole bunch of other areas in Rust.",1418424920

There is a separate client implementation that handles forwarding metrics to the Atlas backend.  The client also polls and reports JMX metrics from the JVM that it runs inside.  Spectator [1] is a new library that provides cleaner abstractions of Servo concepts.<p>* The Prana sidecar [2] was extended to provide REST endpoints for Servo and the client, so that metrics can be delivered from non-Java code.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/servo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Netflix/servo</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/spectator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Netflix/spectator</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/prana"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Netflix/prana</a>",1418424888

This bending of traditional tradeoffs has let us implement features that would have been otherwise impossible.<p>Interfacing with Ruby via its C APIs, we are able to do some pretty crazy stuff, like sample memory allocations in production with imperceptible overhead[2]. Most importantly, we can do it without fear of segfaulting our customers&#x27; servers.<p>It&#x27;s really great to see people other than low-level bitbangers being added to the core team. In this case, having a production user and someone focused on new users demonstrates the Rust team&#x27;s commitment to building a functionally diverse community.<p>Lastly, I think opening up the core team to a wide coalition of companies is the right way to build a robust, long-lived open source project. Yehuda talked a little bit about this in his Indie OSS talk[2].

As a layman when it comes to psychology I think IQ measures some things but the way the brain works, no real world task a person does is exactly like those IQ tests.</i><p>The interesting blog post submitted here is talking about the bread and butter of &quot;industrial and organizational psychology,&quot; namely about how to select individuals for a training program. There are three generations of published research on this topic already, and there is a huge amount of ongoing research on this topic, because organizations all over the world want to figure out how to select successful applicants when there are more applicants than places in school or work programs.<p>The short answer is that there is a HUGE body of research to show that the single best hiring process you can use for hiring a worker, if you want to get a worker who will perform well on the job, is to use an IQ test for hiring.[1] The long answer is that some other applicant characteristics matter too, of course, but the single best thing to look at in a job applicant is &quot;general mental ability.&quot; Work-sample tests are also very good for hiring for specific jobs, and are grossly underused in hiring in the United States.<p>To the point of the interesting submitted blog post, one always has to be empirical about these issues. The people running the bootcamp so far have found data that suggests that the algebra test they have tried is a bit more revelatory than the IQ test they tried, and less expensive besides. One response to that might be to suggest a test like the Wonderlic test (an inexpensive IQ test designed for company hiring procedures) but in the end, results matter. If empirically at this bootcamp, the algebra test works better than some other selection procedure, it doesn&#x27;t even really matter why it works, just that it serves the bootcamp&#x27;s purpose of identifying successful students from among multiple applicants. The data set is still small. I am very glad that the blog post includes a scatterplot of the data. More bivariate data should be shown that way, in blog posts on dozens of topics.<p>[1] My FAQ post on company hiring procedures, which I am still revising to put on my personal website after composing it for Hacker News, provides references for this and some commentary on legal issues in hiring.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613413#up_4613543"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613413#up_4613543</a>",1418423563

8743113,comment,8738646,8742920,0,0,zaroth,,,"> FICA / Payroll Taxes<p>I run a business, from my perspective the meaningful number is the total payroll cost for the employee. Taxes are taken before it even leaves my pocket and goes to the employee, and then more and more taxes by the time the employee finally sees it. You can&#x27;t waive away the taxes just because the law says you can&#x27;t show the true tax burden on the pay stub.<p>> Opportunity Cost<p>There are real, direct, added costs to choosing to work. It&#x27;s reasonable to subtract those from salary when trying to calculate the net benefit of working. Just like there&#x27;s an opportunity cost for waiting in line for bread. It&#x27;s a <i>real</i> thing.<p>> $115300 -> $78,900  vs. $0 -> $44,011  (for a gap of $35k)<p>First, you can&#x27;t take home quite $78,900 on $115,300 -- you&#x27;ve shifted up income but haven&#x27;t adjusted taxes accordingly. From my perspective that employee is earning more like $140,000 (you can&#x27;t just waive away the <i>cost</i> of paying for all those benefits that otherwise would be provided free by the government, just because they are taken out of your earnings before you see them).<p>Second, you can&#x27;t just count $100 / pay period as the cost of insurance. It&#x27;s the full cost of the plan (up to almost $24k / year for Platinum insurance for a family of 4) that has to be paid every two weeks at payday. Benefits are tax advantaged income, income paid out before you see it, but income all the same. If you are self-employed all this becomes obvious, but if you&#x27;ve never worked outside a W-2 the true cost is very much hidden out-of-sight.<p>Employer group insurance plans are <i>more expensive</i> than individual plans, which are obviously way more expensive than free means-tested plans. Going from $0 -> $30k you lose about $8k of value from losing Medi-Cal and going to the Cost-Shared Silver Plan. Going from $30k -> $60k you lose another $12k of subsidies. &quot;Total actuary value&quot; of having Medi-Cal is around $20k / yr for a family of 4. So if you are at $0 income, it&#x27;s not just +$12k for ACA subsidies, it&#x27;s more like +$20k for Medi-Cal since it&#x27;s comparable coverage to a Platinum plan.<p>Third, yes the EITC phases-in and phases-out, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a cost you pay for earning more. It&#x27;s a curve and it&#x27;s not a straight line, but it&#x27;s still a real refundable tax credit that is clawed back as earnings increase over $24k. I agree it&#x27;s impossible to maximize all benefits concurrently, it&#x27;s a very complex equation with local and global minima/maxima. One day I really hope to be able to program it and put in on GitHub.<p>>  Making financial progress on $100k income is challenging<p>So very true! Even per all your numbers, which are way more conservative than mine... the &#x27;net benefit&#x27; to the family of earning &quot;$115,300&quot; of income (~$140k payroll) is only $35,000 !!  (the gap)<p>And if you dig deep into all the assistance available, start counting things like income-based rent control, income-based property tax limits, income-based car registration fees, income-based electricity bills, etc.... you can easily erode that $35k down to more like $15k.<p>Isn&#x27;t that just astounding?! Starting at $140k of employee payroll expense, by the end of the year you&#x27;ve only added $15k of net cash benefit to the family?!<p>As they say, &quot;What the actual fuck!&quot;",1418423438

Say, for example, as a web developer you built a website on Ruby on Rails that converts user-uploaded photos to morph, based on some algorithm, into a cute, unique photo of a kitten.<p>You have several concerns here:\n- Processing the image, hopefully in the background so it&#x27;s non-blocking and you can control resource needs.\n- Storage. Is it on a local disk? S3? Something close by but on the network? If you have a performance bottleneck, is I/O an issue?\n- Memory/CPU. How many resources are needed for n- jobs? Is it starving resources from serving additional web requests (really a separate concern, when you think about it!)<p>I would say for these types of problems (and this is admittedly a contrived example), Rails + some Gem or even pure Ruby might just absolutely suck and eat it.<p>These specialized languages can be a super useful tool for figuring out &quot;simple problems with complicated solutions.&quot; They also offer the comfort of compiling down to a binary that might have no external dependencies (so, very portable depending on the compiler/runtime, and probably very reliable).<p>Is that the right thing for a pure web developer to play? Depends on the developer, but it&#x27;s not surprising you&#x27;re not quite sure what to do with it.

In any case, this example as some &quot;indicator&quot; of Google&#x27;s way is exaggeration with the level of available details.<p>There are lot of details we do not know and we may never know about what/whom led to what/whom precisely. Hindsight always appears precise. So please do not get fooled by hype/halo effect/propaganda/marketing...etc.<p>Conclusions may give wrong sense of comfort that inputs and the reasons provided are complete,sufficient. But it is doubtful and to write such a article, you can go backwards i.e. you may pick some evergreen conclusions/facts, take a popular success related to Apple&#x27;s iphone or Google&#x27;s search engine ...etc, pick a obscure/bizarre incident related to that, add relevant story lines/hypothesis in support of those conclusions and you may have a valid article.<p>Please note that, I am <i>NOT</i> saying this article is written in that way but getting those conclusions from a minor incident like writing on walls, attributing the solution -entirely- -only- to that incident appears like a stretch of imagination. Several past articles in the main stream media can be seen, where both successes and failures in the life attributed to strange/bizarre incidents rather than real hard work, sweat,planning ...etc.They appear like a part of Hollywood movie rather than reality.<p><i>APPEND 1:</i><p>What message should we draw?<p>If you are CEO of small startup, rather than talking to your team directly about real issues, write on kitchen walls or do some unconnected/unexpected thing where employees may not notice or understand the gravity/criticality of situation? If you do that and fail, some other management expert may write an article, criticizing your way of doings, which explains only success counts/matter but not methods for some people.<p>If you are an employee, then should we start looking at walls of the facilities for communication on important stuff rather than usual emails...etc and if by chance, some thing is noted, how do we know what level of importance should be attached to it or focus on it while ignoring the committed items in the pipeline?<p>Since Google became successful, that incident is lauded but if it failed, CEO and culture of the company will be criticized for insufficient communication. i.e. please avoid such communication to increase probability of success.<p><i>APPEND 2:</i><p>Downvoters: Please provide reasons so that if my reasoning is wrong, I am ready to be corrected. Downvoting without reasons won&#x27;t help since I do not know what caused disagreement. Thanks.",1418421655

This article, is a re-interpretation of the interpretation. I seriously doubt if there is any value at all.<p>I think HBR is a major source of management BS. I haven&#x27;t done the research yet but I bet it has published tons of articles in late 90s about how Apple&#x27;s culture sucked, and then after its resurrection, how it worked so wonderfully well.<p>My point is, go create your own billion dollar business, and let HBR package your culture later!",1418421651

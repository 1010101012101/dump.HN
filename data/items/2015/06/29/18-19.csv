The technology part is straightforward.<p>Things happen like shipping containers showing up on the docks without a proper cargo manifest or other documentation errors, which of course leads to the shipment sitting in customs until it gets sorted out. This is because the humans creating those forms often have poor tools, and of course there&#x27;s the usual factors like staff who are too busy, incompetent, or lazy (in an ideal world they should not be doing that job, but this is reality we&#x27;re dealing with).<p>The obvious answer would be a shipping management system integrated with the company&#x27;s supply chain software (typically, their ERP), but usually these problems are coming from OEMs, subsidiary companies, and occasionally 3PLs that have aren&#x27;t part of the company&#x27;s systems.

Your doctor&#x27;s EMR might know the insurance cost, but that cost can still change. And there are lots of middlemen in billing processing in healthcare, so it&#x27;s not an accurate representation of reimbursement anyway.<p>There are quite a few startups trying to remedy this in various ways. Most of them focus on data transparency; they try to aggregate and publicly list all the direct pay costs for different doctors. The problem with that remains the same: most people don&#x27;t have the precedent in their head of paying for healthcare, so they don&#x27;t want to pay direct.<p>Not impossible to fix.

They were trying to do things that were pushing the limits, and pushing them hard, of what could be done on the hardware of the day [1].<p>They showed some benchmarks comparing SMP to Macsyma using the kind of problems that had arisen in their physics research. For &quot;small&quot; problems, SMP was a bit faster.

Only seven did. We labeled our high-performing study cases with the moniker &quot;10X&quot; because they didn&#x27;t merely get by or just become successful. They truly thrived. Every 10X case beat its industry index by at least 10 times. Consider one 10X case, Southwest Airlines (LUV). Just think of everything that slammed the airline industry from 1972 to 2002: Fuel shocks. Deregulation. Labor strife. Air-traffic controller strikes. Crippling recessions. Interest rate spikes. Hijackings. Bankruptcy after bankruptcy after bankruptcy. And in 2001, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. And yet if you&#x27;d invested $10,000 in Southwest Airlines on Dec. 31, 1972 (when it was just a tiny little outfit with three airplanes, barely reaching breakeven and besieged by larger airlines out to kill the fledgling), your $10,000 would have grown to nearly $12 million by the end of 2002, a return 63 times better than the general stock market. These are impressive results by any measure, but they&#x27;re astonishing when you take into account the roiling storms, destabilizing shocks, and chronic uncertainty of Southwest&#x27;s environment. Meanwhile, Southwest&#x27;s direct comparison, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), flailed and was rendered irrelevant, despite having the same business model in the same industry with the same opportunity to become great.&quot;<p>Src: <a href=""http://www.jimcollins.com/books/great-by-choice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jimcollins.com/books/great-by-choice.html</a>",1435602835

The point is so that the people that provide the liquidity during operational hours can add as much information as they can into their pricing models, thereby requiring them to take on less risk with each bit of liquidity they provide.  This less risk gets passed on as savings to the rest of the market participants in the form of smaller spreads.

But it took us insane amount of work to convince management to use a free product. They thought of it as a toy, which would cost company time (and hence money) to implement and get used to, and it won&#x27;t work. And because it&#x27;s free, probably nobody would come fix it. They were always worried of a 2-person ramen hogging company running away with their data.<p>I also learnt that they paid in name of support, even if we did not need the product. We bought highly expensive Ooyala licenses just to upload videos to Youtube (Ooyala offers a lot more, but we didn&#x27;t care for that). Yes, I know we can directly upload them, but as Youtube was free, they didn&#x27;t trust the upload system in case of crisis.

Time spent on the ground is basically waste from the perspective of the airline, and this is especially critical for short-haul routes where these delays add up to a significant portion of the aircraft&#x27;s day.<p>If the aircraft is flying 1 hour trips, and you can reduce turn time from 20 mins to 10, that means that the whole trip is reduced from 1hr20min to 1hr10min, which works out to a 12.5% shorter trip time for the given route.  This means you can either transport 12.5% more people on this route with a given number of aircraft, service 12.5% more equivalent routes with these aircraft, or reduce your fleet size (and marginal costs) by 12.5%.",1435602692

So you&#x27;ll get a bill like &quot;you owe $1,295&quot; but there&#x27;s absolutely no way to reconcile this with the services you received.  You can call your provider and they&#x27;ll try to provide you with a detailed invoice (maybe if you&#x27;re lucky).  If you argue long enough with both then eventually you might get somebody to make some type of adjustment but even still it&#x27;s random.  At the end of the day you might wind up paying $500 just because you figure that&#x27;s as good as it&#x27;s going to get!<p>This is probably a difficult problem to solve, but one thing that might be possible is just a way to look up the bill and translate the insurance &quot;codes&quot; that are meaningless to normal people and require looking up in various medical or insurance sites.

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve put more effort into it than that, but if the weekend project has users and yours doesn&#x27;t, then it doesn&#x27;t matter how good the code is. Getting the users onboard is the hard part. If you don&#x27;t know how to get users, throwing money at you isn&#x27;t going to change that, and isn&#x27;t going to be a good investment. You won&#x27;t be handed a million dollars.<p>If so many YouTubers say they love the idea, then you need to get them to adopt it. Saying they&#x27;d use it and actually using it are different things -- people like to tell you what you want to hear. This isn&#x27;t a chicken-and-egg problem. You only need to convince _one_ high profile YouTube personality to use your platform, and you have a user base. You don&#x27;t have to convince anyone else to join: they&#x27;ll do that for you by using your platform instead of FanFunding/Patreon/etc to ask their fans for support. If you haven&#x27;t already done this, then no investor is going to believe you have the hustle to build this into a billion dollar business that&#x27;ll give them the return they&#x27;re looking for. They&#x27;ll also wonder how you know you built a product anyone wants without doing customer development.<p>Reach out personally to your potential early users, those popular vloggers and bloggers and game casters that already ask their fans for micro-donations, and convince them to try you instead. Send some info to their house along with a box of muffins. Show up at a convention they&#x27;re going to be at and talk to them. Just figure out how to make contact and get their attention. Offer them perks like foregoing fees they&#x27;re paying their current donation platform, and promoting their channel on your site. The foregone fees are your marketing expense. Once they&#x27;re onboard, their supporters will become your first set of users on that side of the marketplace. Move on to the next personality again and again until you have enough people on board that other creators are signing on without you having to recruit them.<p>Facebook didn&#x27;t start with the world, they started with one school.

The web app usually offers a very limited view into orders, and some limited ability to place orders and is customer facing. The desktop app is usually internal to the title company.<p>The amount of money spent supporting these applications is staggering. In one company I know, it&#x27;s ~$3mil a year in application support alone. That cost alone would make a strong case for switching to something more intuitive. The worst part, however, is that they&#x27;re also extremely glitchy. When someone misses a closing because of this software, it&#x27;s a huge deal. That&#x27;s somebody in a hotel somewhere, and a very unhappy bank.<p>Some of them suffer from insanely limited UI&#x27;s, application design that is prone to database blocks, and various bugs such as accounting data updates not being wrapped in transactions and failing to update 2 tables when needed (so you get &#x27;half&#x27; of a payment and your ledgers are out of sync).<p>In practice, here&#x27;s all these boil down to: It&#x27;s a task list (provides user with a list of tasks to complete) that has some attached functionality to help you do the task, and is customizable. The reason most are desktop apps is because the most used functionality is document preparation, which seems to be universally done in Microsoft word using templates by all these companies. They&#x27;re also horribly dated.<p>If this could be a web app, work well, and port data over from the current market leaders into your schema, you would not have to work hard to convince title companies to switch.",1435602012

Their free tier doesn&#x27;t include any private repos, so it won&#x27;t cannibalise sales of paid tiers. I think that their free tier is effectively a trial on steroids - you&#x27;re free to contribute to open source projects, engage with the user community and learn the platform, but you have to start paying from day one if you intend to use GitHub for commercial projects.<p>Heroku&#x27;s free tier is again a sort of supercharged free trial, in that the free tier is too limited to use in production. The free tier offers very little value to users who have no intention of ever upgrading to a paid tier.<p>AWS&#x27;s free tier is just a very generous free trial - after twelve months, you have to start paying.<p>I think in all cases, the key factor is whether there&#x27;s a concrete plan for how the free tier feeds into your business. If your product has high switching costs and requires a big investment in learning to use effectively, then it may make sense to have a free tier specifically aimed at letting people learn the platform. Network effects are the obvious case where free users have real business value. I think that the mistake comes from the presumption that there ought to be a free tier, regardless of whether there&#x27;s a compelling business case for it.<p>As regards you contention that almost every big SAAS product offers a free tier, I think there are at least as many counterexamples - Salesforce, SAP, Citrix, Blackboard, Basecamp, Moz, Kissmetrics.",1435601999

It takes even more effort when you come to a full stop on a bicycle. Once you get moving it&#x27;s not as big a deal to keep accelerating until you get to your cruising speed, though, so there is more of an incentive to just slow down a bit and run stops/lights.<p>Ever since I got a ticket for running a stop as a kid I&#x27;ve been strict about coming to a full stop at all stop signs and red lights.

If biking takes such a toll on your mental processes, I suggest to quit biking. If a car is able to safely stop - so can a bike. Unless you&#x27;re travelling at an unsafe speed downhill.<p>For proper safety, practice tipping in the opposite direction of car traffic. Losing balance or misjudging your tip results with you falling onto a curb rather than in front of a car. I also question how often an experienced cyclist loses their balance when coming to a stop...<p>As a skateboarder, a single pebble that&#x27;s impossible to see while in movement can get caught in my wheel and send me flying into traffic. Cyclists take for granted that a small pebble they can&#x27;t see won&#x27;t send them tumbling onto their faces and into traffic. Learning how to fall is extremely important and doesn&#x27;t seem to be something practiced by cyclists.<p>Worse - a skateboarder doesn&#x27;t have any practical way of stopping when going downhill or at high speeds. You can grind your heel onto the ground or jump off the board. This means you have to control your speed and make sure you&#x27;re not going too fast, you don&#x27;t always have the space needed to carve when you get speed wobbles. This is something many cyclists don&#x27;t consider while they haul full-speed downhill: they&#x27;re travelling at an unsafe speed and refuse to slow down until it&#x27;s too late.",1435601483

The big catch is stack-allocated uninitialized variables. What gcc may do (and I presume clang/LLVM too) is assign an uninitialized variable to a register, but then never give it any stack-space. So, what happens is that the code my always treat register &#x27;a&#x27; as though it contains variable &#x27;i&#x27;, but since variable &#x27;i&#x27; is uninitialized, it never allocates or reads anything from the stack, so the value of &#x27;i&#x27; just becomes whatever happens to be inside of register &#x27;a&#x27; before you attempted to use it. This would cause the variable to appear to randomly change from one value to another, even during single statements, depending on what register &#x27;a&#x27; get&#x27;s used for.<p>For the sparse set of integers, generally speaking that&#x27;s going to be allocated somewhere else all at once, so there is not much the compiler can do to &#x27;realize&#x27; it&#x27;s uninitialized and decide to just ignore the read from memory completely.

Whenever I&#x27;ve used this defense drivers typically state the rules are the rules and common-sense is subjective and we can&#x27;t have people making up things as they go along. I never like this, it just seems typical of the times we live in.",1435600955

Alternately, you might also find that there are some grumpy people who you will be forced to work with or get answers from in order for you to succeed.<p>My strategy is to ask informed questions. Do your best to understand the problem, the motivations, the context, and the available solutions before you start asking questions. Group all of your questions together as best you can and ask them at the same time. Asking questions randomly and repeatedly will probably annoy someone who is trying to concentrate on a task. You might even find that you think of the answers while waiting for the right time to ask.<p>If it is clear that you are giving it your all, and not wasting their time, then people will be much more inclined to help you.<p>Some examples:<p>Bad question: How do I do {X}?<p>Good question: I&#x27;ve learned how to do {X}, but should I instead do {Y}?<p>Bad question: Have you seen {X feature, code, etc}? Why would someone do something so dumb?<p>Good question: I understand what {X} is doing, but it&#x27;s not clear to me why we did it that way. Is there a requirement that I am missing?",1435600860

A good number of people absolutely <i>should not</i> seek treatment, because they will end up in a worse situation than they were previously, as a result of having a &quot;black mark&quot; applied to their record. Whether the net benefit is positive is extremely dependent on many variables.<p>I would support reform that would reduce the downsides of seeking diagnosis/treatment. But absent such reform, it is irresponsible to counsel people to seek treatment without carefully weighing the upside and downside.",1385675928

And so does Common Lisp. I was expecting the same from Scala<p><pre><code>  scala> val i:Int = &quot;5&quot; + 5\n  <console>:7: error: type mismatch;\n  found   : java.lang.String\n  required: Int\n       val i:Int = &quot;5&quot; + 5\n                       ^\n</code></pre>\nYou can easily get a compiler error, if you enforce the type. The inheritance of Javas &quot;I&#x27;ll call .toString on anything&quot; is definitely not something I&#x27;ll defend, but it&#x27;s much less of a problem than it may appear. To do anything interesting with that &quot;fake&quot; integer, you&#x27;ll have to call a method that only accepts integers - and the compiler will throw an error then. E.g.:<p><pre><code>  scala> math.max(&quot;5&quot; + 5, 5)\n  <console>:8: error: overloaded method value max with alternatives:\n    (x: Double,y: Double)Double <and>\n    (x: Float,y: Float)Float <and>\n    (x: Long,y: Long)Long <and>\n    (x: Int,y: Int)Int\n   cannot be applied to (java.lang.String, Int)\n              math.max(&quot;5&quot; + 5, 5)\n                   ^</code></pre>",1385675752

And in any case, in what ways do you see consent of governed not mattering? Are you part of any local democratic organisation? Have you bitched about anything to your local alderman (assuming you live in a city)? How is that if my consent does not matter, the garbage picking became better when I bitched about it?<p>For sake of simplicity, lets talk about UK. If the consent of governed does not matter, why hasn&#x27;t David Cameron taken all the land for himself, a la William the conquer?  Was the history of past 1000 year just sham? Something people told themselves to drink the cool-aid? Did all the workers who rioted and all the people who fought and died on side of  Parliament against the King stupid? Why exactly are these people living under lie? And how does that country, based on lies and shams, has a well functioning society where you can go from being born in poverty to governing the country in one life time?<p>And any ways, you still haven&#x27;t answered the question.

For numeral types, it makes the sum of the operands. For string, it concatenates them. These are two different meanings in different context.<p>For the numeral types, it will not protest if you sum up a float with an int (and I think most programming languages won&#x27;t either). The rules of the language are quite clear: the int would be coerced to a float, then the two float be added, and a float will contain the result.<p>For the string operation, you could force the operands to have all the same types, but you could also practice the same kind of coercion: convert everything (yes, it works for every object of any sort) to a string, then concatenate.<p>OK, it may be odd mathematically, but let&#x27;s see it for what it is: a very handy syntactic sugar in the form of an overloading of the meaning of +, which obey simple rules, and thus have no potential to mean something else than what the programmer meant.",1385675514

6816537,comment,6814650,6814650,1,0,jayhuang,,,"I think many of us expected this. In previous years, much of the discussion and knowledge-sharing among web developers has been about ways to minimize page-loads, and about flash dying.<p>Nowadays with the proliferation of JS MV*, Node on the server-side, HTML5 games in JS, much of the focus and attention has been about how to find better performance in our JS code, how to more efficiently deal with the DOM and re-paints, how to get JS to a state where we can have a lot more complex games inside the browser. Also has to do with the nature of putting everyone on the client-side and the increased amounts of libraries being used (many of which are probably in the user&#x27;s browser cache already).<p>That said, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the change in focus alone, or if it&#x27;s also because many of the new-er web developers haven&#x27;t yet been working for the web back when the discussion was about page-loads and when people cared more about supporting legacy-legacy-legacy browsers (I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re slowly letting that go...).<p>Regarding web fonts, well I guess it has to do with our obsession with pretty apps and thus, pretty fonts too.",1385673820

Not fit to adopt kids (not everybody is fit and we should never make this an incentive to get money. We had many horror stories of froster parents gaming the system to earn more money while neglecting kids). The best way to do this is to limit to 2-3 kids and pay based on the grades, not just because they have a kid.<p>5. Already took college classes or even graduated but there&#x27;s not enough jobs in the field.

Mothers don&#x27;t have to work two jobs to support their kids, they can actually spend more time home with their kids. Which would actually benefits our future, led by kids in stable homes.

They might be more motivated to do some menial jobs like taking care of elders, cleaning up the streets near them, and so on.<p>The reality is that the smarter we make our robotics, the less jobs there&#x27;ll be for anybody, even those who did everything right to get a job, they just won&#x27;t be able to find a job.",1385673152

Has somebody actually managed to build a native HTML5-based UI that isn&#x27;t a laggy and clumsy piece of shit yet? For example, webOS looked great but even the simplest lists scrolled with less than 30 frames per second. The videos I&#x27;ve seen of FxOS don&#x27;t show much promise either (although those are running on really low-end hardware).<p>I&#x27;m really skeptical that trying to shoehorn something called &quot;hypertext markup language&quot; and a generic web rendering engine like WebKit into a UI toolkit is ever going to work smoothly. Even on my desktop computer complex sites can work slowly at times. But I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong.",1385672573

I ask, because I had those ideas unabashedly hammered into my brain my entire childhood in government schools.

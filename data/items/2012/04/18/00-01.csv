3855875,comment,3855355,3855605,7,0,andymatuschak,,,"Now, I'm not trying to incite a native vs. web flame war here, but I believe that building separate native UI layers would have actually been much better. I hope I can provide some constructive criticism on the native app for the Mac:<p>The app, as it stands, does not behave like any of the others on my screen. This greatly increases the startup cost for me, since it doesn't follow the idioms I've already learned (and which I'm concurrently employing in these other apps).<p>For instance, the code editor doesn't behave like any other text editor on my screen (including the Xcode and TextMate source editors open alongside): Ctrl+Arrow doesn't navigate; double-click-and-drag doesn't select by word; my services are not available in the contextual menu; etc.<p>The keyboard shortcut for ""change tab"" that works in all the other tabbed windows on my screen does not work in this interface. The same goes for zooming shortcuts, ""find"" within the source editor, etc.<p>Then there are more fundamental disconnects: there's a ""save"" button in the interface, for example. That's an extremely rare thing to see in a Mac app. In fact, as of Lion, the user should never have to explicitly save.<p>Now, of course, building a native UI layer (in terms of design, not just ABI) would be a great deal of work. You could reasonably argue that it wouldn't be <i>worth</i> that work, but I'd just like to point out that it would indeed provide a much better experience.",1334710659

The original vision for Smalltalk is that you would be using some application, get curious about how it worked (or want to change it), press ctrl-C to start a debugger, start reading code, start editing, get curious about how the debugger works, press ctrl-C again, start reading code, start editing... That smooth progression from application user to programmer to tool developer was a conscious design goal of Smalltalk (also of Lisp), and has gotten lost somewhere along the way.  Once you take responsibility for your own tools you quickly learn to use your new-found powers sparingly, but it's a completely different feeling being a programmer in an environment you can modify than being a programmer in an environment someone else made and you can't touch.",1334710637

3855848,comment,3852731,3853596,3,0,arielweisberg,,,"I'll start by saying I dig Redis. I wish we had a storage engine that offered some of the kinds of flexibility that Redis does. If I were making Volt from scratch I would embed Redis or something with flexible schema and secondary indexes and spend less time working on SQL and more time working on distributed functionality.<p>>These benchmarks don't mean much to me -- what matters is performance for your application.<p>Very true. Think about how you would implement an application like Voter in Redis. Voter is an event counting app that applies business logic server side to do what is basically fraud detection.<p>Let's take a look at what each of these transactions is.\n<a href=""https://github.com/VoltDB/voltdb/blob/master/examples/voter/src/voter/procedures/Vote.java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/VoltDB/voltdb/blob/master/examples/voter/...</a>\n3 statements and an entire round trip to validate data is kosher.\n1 insert/update statement that is actually updating two different summary views<p>You would need to implement your own locking to get the isolation necessary to implement the business logic and there would be at least two round trips for each vote. You would also have to write your own code to maintain the materialized view used to print the summary. Sure you could implement the validation logic client side, but then you lose the ability to transactionally update said logic and the state it depends on.<p>With the new scripting functionality in Redis you would be able to do it in one round trip but you would still end up writing your own code for the view and rollback. How you will attach a debugger to debug your server side logic is also worth considering. I mistakenly wrote that Redis doesn't cache Lua scripts, but it actually does.<p>Now that you have server side logic you will also probably want to start maintaining replicated state to make some of your transactions single shard transactions. With Redis you are on your own for updating replicated state in a way that stays consistent across the cluster even when restoring different shards.<p>Also, no matter how fast Redis is you may reach a point where you have run out of disk/network IO, or even CPU. Now you are looking at sharding Redis. You are probably going to want to maintain replicated state to make more of your transactions single shard transactions. With Redis you are on your own for updating replicated state in a way that stays consistent across the cluster even when restoring different shards.<p>Don't forget re-sharding and backups which are now your problem. You definitely want to be able to roll back to before that last application update that corrupted your data. Don't forget that you will need to bring the replicas up in the correct state as well. Preferably in parallel with bringing up the master since you are down right now, and it would be nice if it resharded at the same time since you took this opportunity to add capacity. Redis cluster is coming, but it isn't here today and depending on the application you may not want to risk it not being ready when the time comes.<p>You should at least double the number of ops (where an op is roundtrip to the DB) done by Volt if not more. That said, doing half as much work inside the procedure doesn't make it twice as fast and doing twice as much doesn't make it twice as slow. The dominant cost for such a trivial operation is not the operation itself. Redis is much better at this because it is single threaded and written in C. My bet is that the number of instructions and cache misses to accept and execute a command in Redis is much smaller because the execution engine isn't dealing with stored procedures, schema, undo logging, SQL, and code expecting to deal with distributed transactions even if none are in play.<p>>I'm not sure if I am supposed to be impressed or not.<p>If you haven't tl;dr-ed already I'd call it good.",1334710281

3855844,comment,3853921,3853921,1,0,latch,,,"To me the question betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of NoSQL. For the most part, NoSQL isn't a categoric replacement for relational databases but rather an additional set of potential tools. For a lot of system, you'll only need a single solution, and a given NoSQL product might provide a number of benefits over relational databases. There are, of course, benefits to a single solution, like simplicity.<p>However, there are solutions that relational databases tend to be better suited for than most NoSQL solutions. Compared to a number (but certainly not all), NoSQL solution, RDBMS tend to provide better ACID guarantees. They were also meant to work well with data on disk, versus only data in RAM. They are obviously suited for highly structured data. Finally, the biggest advantage in my mind is reporting. You can argue that map reduce is more powerful and, properly implemented, scales infinitely better, but for people not dealing through terabytes of data a day, relational databases are better for reporting simply because they have better tooling. Not only is the tooling support (like excel) better, it isn't uncommon to find a business analyst tweaking a GROUP BY or WHERE clause to achieve what the want.<p>Why pick redis + something? Two common cases: large data, ad-hoc querying. If you are doing a time series, you'll often see people store just the ID in a redis sorted set, get the range of Ids they want, then go to something else and pull out the full records based on those ids. This can be a must-implement solution if you are dealing with large, of numerous records. As for ad-hoc queries, if you are familiar with Redis, this should be obvious. Maintaining a lot of secondary indexes manually can be a pain.",1334710209

The fact is there is a systemic bias against un- or under-privileged groups such that the privileged person will almost always perform better on even an objective assessment, so affirmative action is a systematic correction.<p>In order for a privileged person and an un-privileged person to be even within spitting distance of one another academically or professionally requires a hell of a lot more work on the part of the un-privileged person, no matter how hard the privileged person worked. Affirmative action recognizes this and rewards that work despite the decontextualizing ""objective"" assessments that would give the reward to the higher achiever, basically placing a bet that in aggregate, giving these people more opportunity will result in better results.<p>Will there be errors? Sure. But it's a bit rich to complain about white boys being oppressed by women and minorities.",1334709893

It's vulnerable to the ""but I have nothing to hide!"" objection.<p>To quote something I have written elsewhere on the Internet:<p>Giving the government the power to read your email, tap your phone, and record your porn usage isn't bad simply because it's embarrassing. After all, the data will likely only be seen by a computer. But it gives the government enormous power to make decisions about you -- decisions about whether you may take a commercial airline flight, get a security clearance, or even get a job -- without your knowledge or consent, and without you knowing how they make the decisions.<p>In short, a lack of privacy gives the government the power to be even less transparent in its decision-making, and gives it yet more power over its citizens. It's not a question of discovering your fetishes or being embarrassed, and we shouldn't respond to the ""nothing to hide"" argument as though their conception of privacy is right and having nothing to hide really is an excuse.<p>There's a rather good paper I can recommend on the subject:<p><a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565</a>",1334709788

I would really be benefited by an IDE that has the feature of previewing the output of some code, that way I don't have to run it in the browser every time I make any chances.<p>Anyway, thanks for your recommendation!

3855728,comment,3854468,3854468,5,0,primatology,,,"I don't think this is accurate at all.<p>Suppose you do have an ebook. Theoretically, certainly, you can find the price at which no consumers purchase your book, and the price at which nearly every consumer who sees your book purchases it. Thus you have a demand function. Optimize your demand function, and you have the ideal price for your book.<p>Sure, you can go backwards. Again, theoretically, peg a price, then write an ebook such that its demand curve results in your desired optimal price. Practically, it's impossible to measure potential consumer preferences and interest with much accuracy, but at least it starts you off thinking about what the consumer wants. And the more your consumer wants your product, the more demand shifts outward. I agree that this ""backwards"" model may be a beneficial mindset, because your product will already be optimized for consumer wants.<p>But <i>why</i> would you use Google AdWords as your measure of demand? I could spend a month writing a speed-reading ebook, create an search-engine-optimized website, and notify my friends. With $5/month hosting I already own, my cost structure is essentially zero. Every e-book I sell is pure profit, and I never touched AdWords.<p>The trick is optimizing AdWords spending. For every $1 I spend, will I gain $1 of revenue? If yes, keep spending until that's no longer true. Ceteris paribus, a $100 video course will generate more revenue per $1 of marketing spending than a $20 ebook, because you have 5x more chances to make the sale. That's too much of an abstraction, however. Maybe only 0.01% of click-throughs will be a $100 video course, but a solid 1% of click-throughs will buy a well-reviewed $20 ebook. So thus it's actually <i>more profitable</i> to advertise on Google AdWords<p>Perhaps a conversion rate of .015 is a decent ballpark for estimating AdWords revenue. But not total demand for the product.",1334708199

Smalltalk's syntax is really cool when you're just working within the smalltalk system itself, but at the edges it gets clunky.<p>The other problem is smalltalk just seems to like living in its own world.

His reasoning is sound though.<p>IF you list the price in the ads, that would maybe explain the measly 1% CTR and high CPC's (Low Quality Score).<p>I have rarely seen a case where charging more didn't increase profits, even if you lose sales and get some bad clicks. (within the context of providing the perception of more value than the price.)<p>His point is simply, take the most expensive source of traffic online and underwrite to solve for the bottom line margins you need to advertise.",1334707405

End result is a box that's too large, costing us up to $25 to ship. Our product is currently priced at $95, including shipping anywhere in Australia. Already our sales are low due to the cost.<p>I'm starting to see value in picking an easy-to-ship product, or designing a product around ease and affordability of shipping.<p>Our next steps are: choosing a fixed-price postage satchel so we can maintain consistent postage ($11ish), having boxes custom-made that fit in that satchel (not much more expensive than what we're getting now) and then tweaking our product to fit those smaller boxes.",1334707229

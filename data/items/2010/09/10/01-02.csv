All HDR really is is a technique for gathering more information that can be post-processed.<p>And, from what little we've seen of HDR+auto tone-mapping on the iPhone, it could be the harbinger not of rampant pyschedelic tone-mapping, but of more reserved and tasteful tone-mapping.<p>One thing I'm willing to bet on, though, is that this will elicit a lot of criticism from the people who've fallen in love with the limitations of current cinematographic techniques. They'll complain about how you can actually see stuff in shadows, and that the lens flare doesn't do enough to obscure the subject, all without realizing that this advance merely makes those things optional.",1284083664

1677614,comment,1676426,1676426,0,0,Keyframe,,,"I use a simple formula for pricing - what I make times four:<p>- 1/4 what I make<p>- 1/4 equipment and software cost and amortization<p>- 1/4 corporate profit (I have a company setup)<p>- 1/4 corporate cost overhead + corporate tax<p>so if I make $100 per hour - total cost is $400 + VAT per hour. Cost per my hour is the variable here - because some things are more expensive than others. 3D VFX costs up to $400 per hour, while a simple coding session or a gfx session might be $50. Thus it can vary from $200 to $1600 per actual working hour. It depends on the complexity of the task. Also, after a certain threshold of needed working hours I tend to switch to a billable day unit vs hours. Other things like if I need to go on location/set etc. play an additional role.<p>same goes for time needed, but in more loose terms: Whatever I think it will take times four - and most of the time that estimate turns out to be right (sometimes due to me, sometimes due to client).<p>But that is just me, over the years I found out that this metrics works best for me.",1284083602

What skills are you looking for? What kind of project might I show you that would get me in the door so I could contribute (i.e. make myself useful) and learn (i.e. make myself more useful)?<p>While I'm here, I might as well add: For the record, I am looking for an entry level position or internship.

1677554,comment,1677013,1677013,0,0,adammichaelc,,,"This seems like pretty twisted advice if you ask me. Maybe the only redeeming thing in the post is understanding power-hungry people so you don't fall for their traps. Though that's a bit depressing because sometimes what you study ""to try to avoid"" is what you become. <rant>As an example, some people study all the bad crap going on in the world, and they do it all the time. They study the power-brokers in high places doing shady deals. They look deeply into conspiracies -- some of which are probably true. They look at the deep and dark parts of the world; always justifying with things like, ""if I don't understand these things how can I be a part of the solution?"" Sometimes they get sucked in though to all the crap and they become some of the most depressing, annoying people. While it's true that you need to understand the dark parts of the system in order to fix them, it's important to remember balance.</rant><p>edit: I suppose the relationship version of my example is those who are afraid to trust others and have happy relationships because they are focused on the dark and scary things that have happened to them in the past by those who have taken this post's advice and other similarly poor advice, or bad things that they've heard have happened to others, etc. Reminds me of something attributed to Shakespeare, “A coward dies a thousand deaths, a hero only one.” It's almost always better to look at the bright side, because you will probably end up having a few great relationships, than to look at the negative, and definitely have none.

This describes my coursework at Stanford almost exactly.<p>My major was STS (Science, Technology, and Society) with a minor in psychology. Then I studied sociology in grad school.<p>What I focused on was social influence, persuasion, and behavioral change. I took courses on negotiation, deception, cults, magic, minority influence, organizational development, group dynamics, arbitration, personality/social psychology, persuasive technology, and a ton more. I was a researcher in the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab for years.<p>And I mixed it with practical applications of negotiations in the field.<p>The coursework has helped me dramatically in understanding the motivations, attitudes, and behaviors of others.<p>I still remember one of my Comm professors talking about how other technical disciplines tend to look down on areas like psych/comm.

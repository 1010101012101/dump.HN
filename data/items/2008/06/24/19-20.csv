A Ruby => PHP compiler would be very interesting because it would allow you to write Ruby code (fun!) on any system that runs PHP (many!). A PHP => Ruby compiler would be of questionable use because it would allow you to write PHP code (yuck!) on any system that runs Ruby (not so many!).",1214337279

If it's Peter Norvig during his recent startup school talk <<a href=""http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/peter-norvig-at-startup-school-08"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/peter-norvig-at-start...</a> > he pointed out advances in image recognition, language translation and driverless cars as examples that AI research is already succeeding. ""Now if you only define success as 'Can we duplicate a human?' - well, maybe that's a harder goal. On the other hand, I've done that, too - I have two kids, and they're pretty smart.""<p>If you ask Kevin Warwick, a.k.a. Captain Cyborg, who hosts this year's Loebner Prize Contest at Reading University, a machine might pass the Turing test a little more than four months from now: ""I believe machines are getting extremely close - it would be tremendously exciting if such a world first occurred in the UK, in Reading University in 2008. This is a real possibility.""

Roughly, they claim we're getting there, agree that everybody else is doing it wrong, but can't agree on which of them is doing it right. But wait, even Doug Lenat is still in the game; go watch his Google presentation <<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7704388615049492068&q=engedu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7704388615049492068...</a> >.<p>And then there are those who think that AI is a medium (""Expressive AI""), and that the most interesting applications are in videogames like ""Spore"" and interactive dramas like ""Facade"". That's what interests me most, personally. Well, I keep track on all the other stuff, too, but I see that also from the AI-as-medium angle, not from a the-singularity-is-coming angle.<p>Oh yea, and then the article quotes a ""futurist"" called Daniel Burros: ""The first application of successful AI was in the financial services industry for loan qualifications. Loan qualification went from one to two weeks down to minutes."" A qualification that struck me as kinda subprime, I must say.",1214337053

226688,comment,226657,226657,0,0,iron_ball,,,"VOIP isn't it. Only the hardcore had third-party VOIP applications like TeamSpeak and Ventrilo, and in-game VOIP is a very recent thing.<p>Instead, I can break the game's success into three aspects: initial install, short-term retention, and long-term retention.<p>Getting people to even pick up a game (or register with a webapp) is one of the hardest parts. World of Warcraft came into the space with a huge lead in that respect. With the established base of extremely loyal fans, and giant brand recognition in its space, it was sure to get massive attention. The vast majority of new products cannot hope for a thousandth of the eager launch-day users WoW had. Blizzard reaped the fruits of years of brand-building and marketing.<p>Short-term retention is covered in other comments. The game runs well on old hardware, looks pretty due to great art direction, plays smoothly, doles out a lot of quick rewards, and so on. Over the first few weeks, the player is bombarded with tons of fun things to do and sharp increases in character power.<p>Long-term retention is the real magnet, though: the game never becomes a chore until the very end. All the way to the max level, the player is led from locale to locale, challenge to challenge, in a masterly display of game design. Compare the solo-friendly WoW leveling experience with the infamous ""hell levels"" of Everquest.<p>And what's more, people seem to keep playing at the maximum level, even if they are NOT tackling the high-end raid content. (For the uninitiated, a ""raid"" is an extremely difficult, often murderously difficult game area whose enemies can only be defeated with a level of teamwork, personal skill, and above all <i>time investment</i> beyond the capabilities of most players.)<p>Raid gamers are not where Blizzard is making its bread and butter. Instead, the people WoW is retaining are the people who are doing repetitive, seldom-updated content in exchange for slow, incremental, but guaranteed rewards. For example, there is a Capture the Flag team-battle level that has not changed in years -- and people still play it, over and over, in exchange for a handful of points each time. Thousands and thousands of these points can be traded in for a top-notch weapon.<p>The final major retention pull for WoW is the social aspect: after a while, you aren't playing so you can have fun. You're playing so OTHER people can have fun. You don't want to let down your team, so you log in for scheduled events whether you like it or not. This afflicts raid and ""casual"" players alike, to different degrees.<p>So, you want to make a Facebook app that taps into the same qualities as WoW? Make it extremely fun to use at first; give users a sense of reward and increasing power/ability; then make the rewards come slower and slower, in less and less value, for the same amount of work.

My language fails me at the moment but I have put off posting on this for a few ""CSS Framework"" articles on HN until now. I just don't like them, there will never be a framework friendly enough to compete with all the different print and web designers that decide to throw a website together. If that framework did exist it would be enormous and then not usable for the reason of bloat. They walk a fine line between niche code snippets and an elephant code base of CSS styles.",1214335104

I think the introduction of the functional module will actually be good, because there's less resistance to adding clever features for higher-order functions in the standard library than there is in the core language (in Python, at least, since it aims to be small and beginner-friendly).

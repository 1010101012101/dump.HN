Documenting your idea is a bit more involved then just slapping a few paragraphs down and sending it off to the legal team.<p>As an IBMer, I&#x27;ve refused to participate in patents because they are a net negative for society. IBM does however reward you for filing patents.<p>In the USA, it&#x27;s like $1000 for your first file and then royalties from the patent in some cases (I&#x27;ve heard 1%, but this is just a rumor) if it is granted. Beyond filing your first patent there are different tiers for the number filed & accepted that provide extra monetary reward.<p>As far as I am aware, there are no divisions at IBM that just sit around and come up with new patents. Novel ideas come as a product of working on other things, so a team doing nothing but patents would probably quickly run out of inspiration. There are however monthly meetings with &quot;Master Inventors&quot; who have been through the process several times and are willing to help mentor you through the process. As an employee, management regularly has asked (2-3x a year) if anything we&#x27;ve done we thought was patentable.",1394301424

We understand the phenomenon perfectly well, and can predict the surface temperature of the planet as a function of how much energy the human race produces. The upshot is that at a 2.3% growth rate (conveniently chosen to represent a 10× increase every century), we would reach boiling temperature in about 400 years.

This bothered the students at first, but they&#x27;ve come around and become much more thoughtful about what they write.<p>> <i>“Teaching chess is really about teaching the habits that go along with thinking,” Spiegel explained to me one morning when I visited her classroom. “Like how to understand your mistakes and how to be more aware of your thought processes.”</i>\n> <i>&quot; I saw Spiegel trying to teach her students grit, curiosity, self-control, and optimism.&quot;</i><p>Which is really what teaching is about.  I think most teachers know this, and we get a fairly healthy dose of it in professional development every week.

7365793,comment,7365326,7365326,1,0,joveian,,,"I was curious about bitcoin&#x27;s origin (not so much with a name but in how and why it was developed) and looked into it a bit yesterday.  My summary: Satoshi used one or more of the commerical payment systems of the late 90s/early 2000s, wanted something like that that didn&#x27;t rely on the trust of a particular third party, and realized that hashcash + Haber and Stornetta&#x27;s public timestamp system could achieve that.  Satashi wrote the code first (C++ on Windows), worked out the practical details, then wrote the bitcoin paper to summarize the key ideas and calculate the properties the system had.  While there was some ideological basis for the idea, Satoshi was much more interested in writing code and solving a problem then in talking about the ideology.  Possibly imitating the commerical systems, Satoshi did have a bit of a marketing spin.<p>My guess is that Satoshi did not actually know about Nick Szabo&#x27;s bit gold.  There seem to have been several people working on vaguely similar ideas at the time.  It looks like Nick got a sense of the bitcoin way of doing things from comments on his blog maybe six months before the bitcoin paper was released (it isn&#x27;t clear when the comments were made and Satoshi had already been working on code for at least a year at that point), but a couple of years after bitcoin was released Nick still seemed to like the bit gold way better.   Bitcoin could be seen as a simplified bit gold, but I think it makes more sense that bitcoin is hashcash + public timestamps without direct influence from bit gold.  Nick approches the issue from a much more economic theory perspective (which is really interesting reading IMO): \n<a href=""http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-y...</a>\n<a href=""http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/04/bit-gold-markets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/04/bit-gold-markets.ht...</a>",1394301126

And sometimes resting and letting the solutions bubble up into your consciousness is where it&#x27;s at.<p>Here&#x27;s my theory on when they both apply, based on my experience:  When you&#x27;re in a problem domain that you&#x27;ve mastered thoroughly, then writing code non-stop is where it&#x27;s at. When you&#x27;re in a problem domain that you&#x27;re newer to and haven&#x27;t mastered as thoroughly, then you&#x27;re going to be banging your head against the wall more often and find your solutions more often while resting.<p>This is the big difference between &quot;research&quot; and &quot;development&quot;.  If it&#x27;s a research project, you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re doing, or how to do it, so there is much uncertainty.  If it&#x27;s a pure development project, you pretty much know what to do and you go bang it out.<p>I started contemplating this a lot because for about 20 years, I did business software-- ERP systems-- inventory control, order management, that sort of thing.  I had been doing it so long that every problem that came up, I pretty much knew exactly how I was going to architect the data, everything just instantly crystallized in my mind once I&#x27;d talked with the stakeholders about what kinds of problems we needed to solve.  I could estimate development timeframes astonishingly well.<p>Then I moved into game development a few years ago, and suddenly my ability to estimate went into the toilet.  I started finding that trying to code 15 hours a day wasn&#x27;t as effective as it once was.  I spent a lot of time being stuck with problems.<p>Finally I realized that the reason I was so radically productive and good at estimating things wasn&#x27;t because I&#x27;m a natural programming badass.  It was because I had 10+ years of experience doing the exact kind of things I was doing, and developed all kinds of experience, intuition, and tools to rock the house.  Once I changed problem domains and languages and lost my old bags of tricks, the entire landscape changed.<p>So I agree with you that sometimes it&#x27;s all about banging out a ton of code, and sometimes it&#x27;s more about relaxing and meditating.  Most developers today-- if they&#x27;re not going obsolete-- are radically changing technology landscapes every few years.  Or should be.",1394300729

For example, one question is basically knowing the definition of a trinomial, which is all about memorizing a definition, and has nothing to do with understanding the underlying mathematics. It&#x27;s a problem of syntax and the meaning of a word, not semantics.<p>Another requires calculating the area of a square by knowing to measure the lengths of the sides and multiplying them with each other. This is all about memorizing a set of procedures and applying them.<p>Contrast that with this German question for 7th/8th graders: <a href=""http://www.joerg-rudolf.lehrer.belwue.de/j3/images/mathe_sek/m8/Kongruenzbeweis6.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joerg-rudolf.lehrer.belwue.de/j3/images/mathe_sek...</a><p>You&#x27;re required to show that the quadrilateral IJKL is a square if the distances AE, BF, CG, and DH are of equal length, for which you have to show that all sides of IJKL are of equal length and that the angles of IJKL are all right angles. This requires a number of substeps, since you&#x27;ll be reducing the problem to the question of congruences between triangles. More importantly, the point is not the difficulty of the question but that the question requires application of knowledge to a novel situation that the student hasn&#x27;t encountered before (known as &quot;transfer of learning&quot; [1]), whereas US math problems tend to be carefully tailored to be straightforward applications for the memorized procedures. To the point that it is known that US math tests tend to eschew even word problems [2] to a great degree.<p>Nobody says that &quot;teaching to the test&quot; doesn&#x27;t teach students <i>anything</i>.

I&#x27;ve finally hit my new year&#x27;s resolution of delegating more:  I&#x27;m now subbing out most of my back-end dev as well, leaving me to focus on client relations and management.<p>My subs are all remote folks I&#x27;ve coded in the trenches with and trust. My customers are all word-of-mouth and view me as a &quot;developer + team&quot; rather than a Brand, LLC type of firm. I follow the (somewhat risky) model of One Large Client + Several Smaller Clients, and cashflow is usually decent.<p>The sales cycle in my business can be lengthy -- a few weeks of courting followed by a few weeks of estimation, proposals, and contracts. I typically receive leads from my contacts and do the rest myself, but I want to delegate this process as well if possible.<p>Question:  how can I leverage a commission-only tech-knowledgable sales-person in this situation?<p>Challenges are:<p>a) I can only take so many clients at once (until I scale up operations), so I definitely won&#x27;t be this salesperson&#x27;s only source of work.<p>b) Beyond procuring the lead and getting the customer excited about the business solutions we can provide, it seems that the bulk of the sales cycle (the in-depth proposals, etc.) is out of scope for most salespeople.<p>Is the occasional mid-4-figures (USD) commission enough to attract a salesperson who can do more than just get me leads?

Of course, since these samples were discovered in nature- no effort was made to prevent degradation over the post-death timeline. Some estimates say that a DNA strand could still retain useful information for as much as 1.5 million years.[1] We have amplified and sequenced information preserved in nature for 80,000 years.[2]<p>That half-life estimate is based on samples that were not always in solid state, which is an empirically more stable preservation state for DNA.<p>Specifically, the samples were usually not protected from water and oxygen throughout the entire storage period.<p>It is important to keep in mind that despite the <i>observed</i> half-life of DNA (which is still far longer than <i>any</i> existing/practical high density storage medium), it still retains useful information as it degrades for thousands (theoretically, millions) of years.<p>Also, you won&#x27;t be storing the information on just a single strand, but on billions of strands. This redundancy affords you the ability to reliably amplify and sequence different non-degraded segments after many half-lives.<p>Notice that I said &quot;...if stored properly...&quot;, granted, I wasn&#x27;t clear, but it is certainly theoretically possible to preserve information for millions of years in DNA.<p>DNA is already the highest density storage medium that we use to store human produced information, such as a book. [3] Right now with current storage methods (room temp, dehydrated) we have an archival storage medium reliable for thousands of years.<p>If we can crack two things: extremely high speed sequencing, and ultra-long term solid state storage of DNA; it will be the ultimate high density long term storage medium short of sculpting code into metal at the atomic scale.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2013/01/24/170082404/shall-i-encode-thee-in-dna-sonnets-stored-on-double-helix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2013/01/24/170082404/shall-i-encode-thee-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11555"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://arep.med.harvard.edu/pdf/Church_Science_12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arep.med.harvard.edu/pdf/Church_Science_12.pdf</a>",1394298839

The outcomes are pretty easy to enumerate:<p>1. You ask for more money. They negotiate; you end up with a higher salary. It might not be what you initially asked for, but that&#x27;s how negotiation works, and it should be higher than what they offered. This is a success.<p>2. You ask for more money. They say, &quot;Oh geeze, we&#x27;re really sorry, but there&#x27;s straight up no room for negotiation here; you&#x27;re either going to have to accept the offer as it stands, or walk away&quot;. This isn&#x27;t a success, but it&#x27;s not really a failure either because you haven&#x27;t lost anything; you&#x27;re in the same place you were before, making the same decision, but now you&#x27;ve got a little more information.<p>3. You ask for more money. The company is offended that you have the temerity to negotiate, and they take their offer off the table. This looks bad, but it&#x27;s a success as well. If a company gets salty at you for trying to negotiate a better salary and rescinds your offer, that&#x27;s a pretty clear sign that you wouldn&#x27;t have been happy working there and you&#x27;ve dodged a pretty major bullet. In my mind, that&#x27;s good news.<p>For advice specific to negotiating, even without a counter offer, I&#x27;ll point you towards Patrick Mackenzie&#x27;s blog post on the topic; it&#x27;s got some very good advice and is worth reading: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/</a>",1394298711

The semantics of GC&#x27;d pointers and linear types are just too drastically different, especially with how they interact with mutability and inter-task communicability. We &quot;officially&quot; abandoned GC in the language itself last October, and we&#x27;re <i>still</i> trying to wrest the last vestiges of its use out of the compiler itself. Ask pcwalton how much of his time has been spent doing exactly that in the past four months. Just yesterday one of our most tenacious community contributors proudly announced that an all-nighter had resulted in removing two more instances of GC&#x27;d pointers from the compiler, which required touching &quot;only&quot; a few thousand lines. It&#x27;s a bad scene.<p>So yes, while Rust will still offer GC&#x27;d pointers in the standard library, we&#x27;ve long since learned not to encourage users to reach for them without great justification. You must understand that once you introduce garbage collection into your code, it will be very difficult to return from that path.<p>We&#x27;ve also, in practice, tended to point people toward RC&#x27;d pointers (with weak pointers to handle cycles) whenever anyone needs multiple references to the same piece of memory. Thanks to linear types, reference counting in Rust is actually surprisingly cheap (many instances where other languages would need to bump the refcount are simply achieved by moving the pointer in Rust, since we can statically guarantee that that&#x27;s safe).",1394298159

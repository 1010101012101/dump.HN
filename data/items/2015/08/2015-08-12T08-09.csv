Avesh is absolutely right about the points he is making and I think that everybody who are entitled to stocks as a part of their payment package should sell these immediately and construct a more balanced portfolio instead.<p>If you (like myself) feel like you are better at writing software than acting like a wolf on Wall Street you should take a look at index funds. An index fund is a fund that reflects the development of an index (e.g., S&P 500 or FTSE 100). Rather than paying a portfolio manager a high fee (of up to 5% of the invested portfolio) to actively manage your investments, an index fund is designed so that it simply follows an index. This is much cheaper than actively managing the portfolio. Since John Bogle came up with the idea about 40 years ago and founded The Vanguard Group, history has proven time and time again that active investors can&#x27;t beat the market in the long run. Index funds therefore yield a higher net return because of their lower costs (typically around 0.5%).<p>If you are new to investing, I would suggest to go with the three-fund portfolio[1]. Divide your portfolio into three parts and invest in a domestic stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a domestic bond index fund. This would probably yield an annual return of 10-15% with a very controlled level of risk. I have constructed my portfolio like this and I am really happy about it. I don&#x27;t have to constantly worry about my investments and at the same time I can expect a fairly solid rate of return.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio</a>",1439369495

For me it was mostly a &quot;shrug ok so that&#x27;s that, don&#x27;t see the problem&quot; when it came to accidentally using &quot;=&quot; instead of &quot;==&quot;. A couple of friends seemed to have mental blockades and often wrote code containing the typical bug of &quot;=&quot; instead of &quot;==&quot; (the hotfix of 1 == a instead of a == 1 helped some).<p>For me the irritating thing was x = x + 2 since it triggered my math brain which protested and simply said...well that can&#x27;t be, error. So I guess I did have the exact reverse problem always seeing the assignment as an equality.
Thankfully this passes really quickly after you immerse yourself in it for a day.<p>Of course years later one of the first sentences from our Prolog 101 prof was &quot;so you have been programming for a while now...let me write this down...i = i + 1...someone explain what this does...what would you suppose a (stereotyped) mathematician (that only knows math) would tell me&quot;

10046699,comment,10045185,10045864,0,0,zamalek,,,"> Because of the politics<p>Precisely, but not because of the second-half of your sentence. From my experience the problem lies in the revolutionary governments not being voted out: what has typically happened is the governments continue to fight the revolutionary war (which has long-since ended) instead of trying to fix the problems that the oppression of the past created. In some instances the government and governmental systems also become completely fixated on, in complete truth, getting revenge - this is especially true in Zimbabwe and South Africa.<p>One specific example (which is a very touchy subject). South Africa currently lacks electrical power production capacity: homes and businesses can expect up to 8 hours of blackout per week. The electricity utility company made the government aware of this issue circa 2005, at which point the power grid was nearing capacity. This was (and continues to be) because little-to-no capacity upgrades occurred. Instead the government was focusing on ending apartheid: even though that era had ended. It is this kind of focus on the past (instead of the future) that is driving portions of the continent into the ground.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s entirely the fault of all of these governments either: they were born out of strife and it&#x27;s natural that they would continue to cause strife. What should have happened is them being voted out: the problem there is that (due to apartheid and colonization) people were not educated enough to realize the change that needed to occur. The particularly villainous governments, being power hungry and revengeful, would also bribe the impoverished (with food) to vote for them or outright use violence and fear (Zimbabwe). Education remains a sorry story and it&#x27;s thought that this is purposeful. <i>In South Africa there is some hope, as I do believe Madiba did as much as he could to educate the people. This completely ceased when he stepped down, though. South Africa had so much potential during his reign.</i><p>A smaller, but still significant issue, is that Africa is being looted by the rest of the world. E.g. Anglo-Platinum: South Africa exports raw platinum only to re-import the refined product at a higher price. Building our own refineries is a blue sky dream because Anglo-Platinum would pull out, and, we don&#x27;t have enough electricity to run such facilities. Many of our raw materials share this fate.<p>Keep in mind that this is not a universal result in Africa. I hear that Botswana is doing pretty well. This an <i>opinion</i> after living here for 28 years - so I may be somewhat jaded (although you may still find an insider opinion interesting), the truth may be out of grasp for many of us. I can agree with much of what is said in the article. Most assuredly Africa is a very complex place, which would lead to drastically varying opinions about it (especially for those living in it).",1439367539

The RPC pattern is a tad more specific than &quot;any pattern that separates message content from channel&quot;. Likewise, just because you put one <i>or more</i> &quot;verbs&quot; in your payload doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re doing RPC.<p>An RPC system has a much more rigid message structure that represents a function call, which is <i>automatically marshaled</i> via concrete client and server methods. If you&#x27;re just receiving a payload and calling one or more methods based on it&#x27;s contents, you&#x27;re not doing RPC and you&#x27;re not even touching upon any of the problems of SOAP.<p>The actual problems with SOAP have very little to do with the fact that messages can be serialized or that there are verbs. Here are some of the problems with SOAP:<p><pre><code>    - XML is verbose, making transmission slower.
    - SOAP is a huge, complicated type system compared to JSON.
    - Mapping SOAP to a given language is difficult.
    - Security concerns over automatic function marshaling.

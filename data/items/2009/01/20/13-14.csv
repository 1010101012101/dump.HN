441707,comment,441055,441503,0,0,davidw,,,"> When you have a language who's syntax is directly capable of representing that structure natively, it's a huge programmatic boon to simply write the markup directly in the host language.<p><i>IFF</i> the other people you have to collaborate with, such as designers, artists, new programmers, etc... are all fluent in that language.  That's a big 'if' in my opinion.  I can hand someone a Rails template file, and they can hack at it even if they don't know Ruby.",1232459967

441704,comment,437824,441212,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"If you deny any link between benefits and utilization, then I understand your argument. But I think your argument is wrong because it contradicts the very purpose of buying capital goods.<p>You buy capital goods because utilizing them makes you a profit. Just owning them does not. But I agree that this is just a general rule which is not true in all situations, particularly not in economic downturns.<p>If I buy 3 TB of hard disk space expecting to serve 300000 customers and then only 100 customers turn up, I have wasted much of my expenditure because it's useless. If I buy a dynamic amount of hard disk space from a cloud service on demand, then I have not wasted that money.<p>So, clearly, opportunity cost has a lot to do with utilization if you assume a positive connection between utilization and profit, which you apparently don't. Go ask any airline about it :)",1232459818

441701,comment,440856,440856,0,0,markessien,,,"Don't do it. You are wasting your time and it's very inefficient. In China, there are factories that have pre-rolled boards that will give you what you want at very cheap prices. Build a prototype, then get in contact with a chinese sourcer to find you what you need. You'll need to buy in bulk of about a thousand pieces or so - but on the positive side, you can get your frame and so on done there also.<p>Anyone who is even thinking of building such a device themselves is grossly inefficient.<p>If you need a company in china, send me an email I'll direct you to one.",1232459624

For example, they used tree-based data structure algorithms that were proven to be optimal for asymptotically large collections (but were not so great for small collections).<p>That seems like a common thread in my own experience. It's too easy when you start a project to over-engineer to meet some imaginary future need for scale. Fix it later, and 2^32 is big enough for most things :P.",1232458955

In a couple generations, if populations continue to mix (which, in all likelyhood, they will), much of this information may have been lost.",1232458400

There will <i>not</i> be slaves under a Libertarian government because the #1 responsibility of a Libertarian government and the duty of every good Libertarian citizen is to act to prevent coercion.

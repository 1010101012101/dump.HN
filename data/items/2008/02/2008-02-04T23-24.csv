You could do something as basic as rock/paper/scissors, or tic tac toe. Pick n games that are that simple, simplify your sodoku to 1/9th the size, do multivariate / a/b testing to see how the CTR is for each game and let the traffic/users decide.<p>FreeRice is also nice because the domain is short =) although it looks like free/clean water/h2o variations are squatted (as far as instantdomainsearch.com knows) - good luck!",1202169386
109392,comment,109360,109363,0,0,xirium,,,"Running IE precludes an operating system and hardware on which it runs. If you asked about developing for Firefox only then I'd strongly recommend it. This browser can be run on many operating systems. Most importantly, early adopters who are likely to use this browser are more likely to be an early adopter of your service. For the same reason, I'd recommend developing a Firefox plugin rather than an IE plugin.",1202169184

109386,comment,109181,109231,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I tend to agree with you.<p>The problem with this business model is that consumer electronics is some of the easiest stuff to sell on eBay. The units are standardized, so they are easy to describe to potential customers -- when you eBay an iPod [1], the site even offers you canned descriptions and photos of iPods to include in your listing. And, if you keep the original boxes in your basement, consumer electronics is easy to pack up and ship.<p>iPods are an extremely liquid asset: I eBayed two of them a couple months back, and both of them sold within $10 or so of the price that I had predicted based on earlier sales figures. The trading volume is large, and the market value well known, so there's really very little risk that, for example, you'll put the thing online and it won't sell at all.<p>So paying TechForward amounts to a gamble that their promised buybacks are miscalculated in my favor. But that's unlikely, partly because they put a lot more effort into the prediction than I, partly because they presumably build in a factor of safety, and partly because, if they do guess wrong, they may well go out of business before I can collect my winnings. Once these guys declare bankruptcy my $9 is gone forever.",1202168258

109380,comment,109286,109286,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Long before the advent of computers, mathematical notation provided a way to more precisely express ideas than natural language.  Of course, if you are verbose enough, you can express mathematical ideas with prose.  But the corresponding mathematical notation will probably be more clear and easier to manipulate than the prose version for someone well versed in both ""languages.""<p>Programming languages can similarly provide for precise, concise expression of ideas.<p>Your example is a huge leaky abstraction waiting to happen.  What if something about the resulting program is very different than what you expected or wanted?  How do you know at what point things went wrong?  How do you fix it?  What if there were ramifications that were not clear at the high level of your conversation, but the machine dutifully did what you ""wanted"", with repercussions like Mickey in the Sorcerer's Apprentice?<p>The only way programming languages will no longer be useful in the future is if algorithmic thinking is no longer useful.  Is that your assumption here?",1202167583

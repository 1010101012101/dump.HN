Better zipper pulls are stamped from sheet metal - plated steel, aluminum, brass.<p>The video is from a small shop that&#x27;s barely surviving.

And if the dominant console is also something that doesn&#x27;t support DRM, what then?<p>> Browser makers don&#x27;t have some crippling monopoly power over how computers work that they can use to force submission on an entire industry (thank god).<p>No, but customers do. Which is why customers should choose browsers and operating systems that do what <i>customers</i> want.<p>> The idea that the movie industry will give up on something they view as a fundamental requirement for them to earn money, just because browser makers throw a hissy fit, is not reasonable. The movie industry will find a way because they believe their industry must, or else it will wither and die.<p>This is just meaningless rhetoric. It is possible to make money without DRM as proven by the fact that many people are doing it. Piracy does not exclude profitability as proven by the fact that there are more Disney movies on The Pirate Bay than there are in the Disney store and Disney is still making tons of money.<p>The people who think the movie industry would disappear without DRM <i>are</i> idiots. The harder we make it for those idiots, the more share they&#x27;ll lose to people who know better and the fewer idiots will remain.<p>It&#x27;s not even like this is a fight. It&#x27;s just widespread misunderstanding. DRM is <i>bad for the movie industry</i>. It locks customers into closed platforms which put the companies that control those platforms between the studios and their customers. It causes viewers to derive less value from DRM-encumbered content, which causes them to consume it less often and not be willing to pay as much for it. It causes piracy to <i>increase</i> because it has zero effect on the experience of downloading from The Pirate Bay and a negative effect on the experience of paying customers.

In many instances, the Congress or state legislatures conclude that the general welfare of society, wholly apart from any religious considerations, demands such regulation. Thus, for temporal purposes, murder is illegal. And the fact that this agrees with the dictates of the Judaeo-Christian religions while it may disagree with others does not invalidate the regulation.&quot;<p><a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17217681544048586142&q=McGowan+v.+Maryland&hl=en&as_sdt=20000006&as_vis=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=172176815440485...</a>",1423442270

Whereas MySQL tends to be very good at what it can do, and makes it easy to do silly things, like turn off referential integrity in a slow query to boost performance.<p>It almost feels like a worse-is-better story. As a programmer, PostgreSQL is much better to work with; more tools, better EXPLAIN, more features, more types, more of almost everything. But to use in the heat of battle, it&#x27;s less clear-cut. PostgreSQL&#x27;s replication story is complicated. MySQL master-master replication is fairly easy to set up, and if you use a master as a hot failover, it all mostly just works; when the primary site comes back up, it resyncs with the failover.

        if grep -q xyz <<< &quot;$LINE&quot;; then
            COUNTER=$(( $COUNTER + 1 ))
        fi
    done < <(awk &#x27;{print $4,$7}&#x27; infile.txt |cut -d, -f3)
</code></pre>
If you did it in the &quot;awk ...|cut ...| while read LINE...&quot; order, COUNTER would be getting incremented in a subshell, and the value wouldn&#x27;t stick around after the loop.<p>The other most common way I use it is to diff a couple of sets of pipelines or even just files that need sorting before comparison:<p><pre><code>    diff <(sort -u file1.txt) <(sort -u file2.txt)

Technically it should mean 10 square dollars, whatever <i>that</i> is.<p>Years ago an acquaintance of mine told me about a bad experience he had had with some cell company&#x27;s customer service.  It seems that the contract he had received had said that he would be charged for data service at the rate of &quot;.02¢/kilobyte&quot;.  (This was in the very early days of cellular data, so prices weren&#x27;t well established, and I&#x27;m probably not remembering the correct number, but as you&#x27;ll see, that&#x27;s not the point.)  When the bill came, he found that he was in fact charged 2¢/kB -- 100 times more than he expected.  He called to complain, but was unable to communicate to the customer service agent that, correctly read, .02¢ = $.0002.  The agent apparently looked at the notation &quot;.02¢&quot; and read it as &quot;$.02&quot;.<p>One can understand the psychology of this.  The notation &quot;.02¢&quot; contains two indications that the value 2 is to be multiplied by 1/100: one is given by the position of the decimal point, and the other by the use of the cent sign instead of the dollar sign.  But if you read those two indications as <i>redundant</i> rather than independent, you get the interpretation used by the agent (and apparently also by the person who wrote the contract).<p>So I would suggest that the &quot;$10 dollars&quot; thing is not as benign as it appears.  Mathematical notation is not supposed to have redundancies in it, and we should not get used to seeing them there -- particularly when money is involved.",1423441143

The key concept here is that Bitcoin mining -- even at a &quot;Forex loss&quot; -- will essentially trade electricity for Bitcoins, which can be used to purchase other currencies. Depending on what the miner values their local currency at, this can still make financial sense.<p>As an example: suppose you are a resident of country X, and you have 1000 XUnits that are valued at 1000 USD, but there are capital flight restrictions such that you can exchange your 1000 XUnits for only 300 USD. And suppose that you <i>need</i> to exchange your XUnits to USD, for whatever reason. You then use your XUnits to buy electricity and mining hardware, and generate Bitcoins, and sell them for 750 USD.<p>Note that you could try to do the same with e.g. steel, barrels of oil, or widgets, but with hardware you&#x27;d be subject to import/export taxes, and the entire operation would have much higher overhead costs (comparatively, setting up a mining farm is pretty cheap).",1423441113

That either someone knows the origin of an object and therefore it is not a perfect forgery, or all such knowledge has been erased and now there is no way to say that an object is not authentic.<p>I think this is something of a straw man argument. There is an entirely satisfactory functional definition for &quot;perfect forgery&quot; which is that an object is a perfect forgery if it cannot be distinguished from an authentic object by someone with no prior knowledge of the object&#x27;s origin. This is what I believe common intuition would determine the word &quot;forgery&quot; to mean. An object does not fail to be a perfect forgery because its creator knows it is not real. It is a perfect forgery if it can fool everyone else into believing it is real.<p>Making zero knowledge of authenticity a prerequisite for a &quot;perfect forgery&quot; is to neglect that there are multiple independent minds in the world with their own viewpoints. I can <i>know</i> &quot;that is a perfect forgery&quot; if I know it will fool anyone without my private knowledge. Such knowledge is not incompatible with the object being a perfect forgery, because the most sensible definition of &quot;perfect forgery&quot; is that it would fool anyone else, not that it has already fooled everyone including me.",1423440638

But (due disclosure: I worked  at Intuit once and while I have no special knowledge about this deal, I know how Intuit works)<p>Intuit had no choice really. Mint was <i>high</i> on management's radar and they were always scared of it. Intuit doesn't ""get"" the web, the whole company is structured around its success on the desktop  and there are too many layers of management to make any kind of innovation successful (One on team I saw, there were 22 managers and 3 developers! I kid you not!).<p>Intuit <i>talks</i> a lot about ""innovation"", but the fact is that Mint (and FreshBooks) have been chipping away marketshare every quarter and they couldn't build a mint clone/mint killer (they tried a few times).<p>Intuit has no <i>choice</i> but to acquire mint if they wanted to have a <i>solid</i> web offering. Will they run it into the ground? certainly, over time, as soon as the mint devs vest and leave and the regular Intuit folks take over. Of course this leaves the space open for <i>another</i> competitor!<p>Congratulations to the mint team! The one thing Intuit has in plenty  (for now ;-)) is money! Enjoy!<p>EDIT: If I were Intuit and I wanted to make this work, I'd keep the Mint.com team around and let them work in their own fashion, <i>outside</i> the regular Intuit corporate structure.

These distant connections allow you to (theoretically) reach anyone in the world in seven steps. The people are the animals, the tightly connected groups are the categories of animals, and the distantly connected people are associations to another category.<p>He missed the entire class of categories that are based on the name of the animal (e.g. starting with the same letter). I think his multiple-personality technique is a neat treat for bringing different kinds of associations to the fore. That's assuming that you have the (now-meta) connection to the appropriate person in the first place. For example, he didn't think of imagining he's a lexicographer.<p>BTW: I wish he'd leave some white-space to separate hints that he doesn't want you to read.",1252910188

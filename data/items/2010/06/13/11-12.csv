This one looks to be another flyaway like the 2002 ball - so far every single free kick has whizzed way over the bar.

How do you use it?<p>I can understand using a chart to plan things out ahead of time, though to me it seems that it is easy to figure out workable gears when starting out just by riding and eventually you <i>know</i> how to shift in a given situation. The more serious riders will refine that by trying out different combinations in more controlled experiments (power meters when you get to Serious Training). The best gearing always depends on the rider.",1276429024
1427316,comment,1427035,1427035,0,0,pavlov,,,"What about the Ultima games, have they been entirely forgotten as well? They were certainly an important influence on Fallout.<p>In particular, Ultima IV pioneered the concept of a computer RPG protagonist making ethical choices. Instead of ""go kill the bad guy"", the game simply tasked you to excel at virtues.<p>Parts VI and VII were the first games to create a truly immersive RPG world. The non-player characters would have a life of their own: during the day they'd go to work, then enjoy a drink at the pub, and then go home to sleep. Static and inventory objects could be used together in inventive ways -- making bread was the classic example. The plot lines were well-developed and touched upon social issues.<p>(Ultima VIII and IX were developed in 1994-99, after EA had swallowed Origin. Those games are travesties that are best forgotten.)",1276428959

They have your speed & your cadence, and if you entered in your cassette & chainrings they could show you your current gear & the next gear up & down (and how to get to it).<p>I'm not sure how useful it is though. It's not often I'm prepared to do a back & front gearchange at once - I just loose too much speed when I have to easy off the gears.<p>I suspect that as electronic gear shifting (Dura Ace DI etc) becomes more prevalent the gear system will take care of this for us, though.

1427310,comment,1427035,1427035,0,0,TrevorBurnham,,,"I think ""freedom"" in games is overrated. When game designers focus on freedom, they necessarily sacrifice plot and character development. Games that offer the level of freedom of Fallout 1 and 2 aren't in high demand for the same reason that Choose Your Own Adventure books aren't regarded as serious literature, or even pulp fiction.<p>There's a certain novelty to being able to do ""anything"" in a game world, to be sure, but I much prefer games that offer small pockets of freedom within a strong linear narrative. Mass Effect is perhaps the best example, with its cinematic storyline and rich conversation trees.",1276428661

Unfortunately I'm not sure that there is an analogue for larrikinsim in American culture and it's not a concept I can easily explain; there is a subtlety to it that makes it both difficult to convey and difficult to execute.

1427303,comment,1427137,1427273,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I was in South Korea last month and there's a few different attitudes. There's a general sense that there should be one Korea at some point or other, though people disagree on the particulars based on what they focus on when they think about it.<p>Some people think the opportunities for manufacturing and development in North Korea are going to be great and are excited to have more Korean companies do their manufacturing in NK instead of China going forwards.<p>Many of the younger people are excited about the idea of no longer needing two years of mandatory military service, which is currently required mostly because of the North Korean threat (the older generation was more patriotic towards military service, the younger generation seems to see it as a bit more of a burden).<p>Some people are afraid of the ripple effect on the economy, in fact a lot of the Koreans I asked were aware of the West Germany/East Germany example you mentioned.<p>The general sentiment seems to be about 50/50 - half in favor of unification the sooner the better, half in favor of having North Korea as a separate state but with much friendlier and greater cooperation between them, and with a better government in the North. The older people seem more in favor of a short term unification, the younger people seem more disposed towards having North Korea be a separate state until they're ready to join back up.<p>Everyone - <i>everyone</i> in South Korea hates Kim Jong-il, and most people seem kind of embarassed and blush when you mention him.",1276428100

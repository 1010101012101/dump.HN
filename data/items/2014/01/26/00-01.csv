One big conceptual hurdle that many beginners have is the notion that a program is a <i>sequential</i> sequence of steps, and at any point in time during a program&#x27;s execution, there is a unique &quot;current statement&quot; [1] and &quot;current state&quot; (content of variables).<p>Single stepping through your program with a good visual debugger makes these concepts very clear.<p>[1] Of course this is not true for multi-threaded programs, but multi-threaded programs are well out of &quot;beginner&quot; territory.",1390697897

On the other hand, I also just talked with someone I know who has been in the payment space for a long time -- he says he prefers to keep things simple, so not necessarily a &quot;forking&quot; that happens.<p>Eh well, something to think about for me. I think the &quot;forking&quot; concept is useful for me when we start talking about markets for which there is oppression. I&#x27;m not particularly interested in things like drug or gun trade. I&#x27;m much more interested in things like, being able to 3D print a tractor so people can farm land and grow food even if vested interests try to suppress that tractor.",1390697868
7123287,comment,7121144,7121893,16,0,veidr,,,"TL;DR -- it doesn&#x27;t have to be difficult or expensive.<p>It&#x27;s not as hard as you make it out to be. I live in Japan where these (very effective) safety doors have been rolling out for more than a decade.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is any need for computerized stop-assist. On at least some of the trains here, and I think most, it is up to the driver top stop the train. Once in a great while, they accidentally overshoot by a foot or two, apologize on the loudspeaker, and back the train up to align it properly.<p>There is not need for a homogeneous vehicle fleet, either. In fact, in Japan just about every line gets a unique train design (which does seem weirdly inefficient, but whatever). At first they we in fact designing different safety doors to match every train. But later, to cut costs and make it possible to have safety gates at stations featuring trains with different door configurations stop, they just designed wider safety gate that can open more on one side than the other.<p>This brings to mind another simple optimization -- if your trains really suck so much ass that the driver is unable to stop them with reasonable precision, just make the safety gates six feet (or ten feet, whatever) wider than the train doors. (Easier if you make them lift up to open rather than opening laterally.) There is no need for the safety doors to be the same width as the train doors.<p>They also don&#x27;t have to be expensive and made of glass. A cheaper gate consisting of a few strong bars is nearly impossible for a human to <i>accidentally</i> fall through.<p>Finally, it doesn&#x27;t have to be a track feature. Some of the ones here are essentially the same as an American style garage door opener. When the operator/conductor opens the train doors, he then opens the safety gates.",1390697854

7123282,comment,7121268,7122767,2,0,Steuard,,,"I can see two important things to say in response here:<p>1. I&#x27;m surprised that you don&#x27;t know what &quot;brogrammer culture&quot; is, but that&#x27;s okay. The point, though, is that for a lot of other people (particularly women) it is a familiar thing and it makes them feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. You may not have had that experience, but part of having empathy for others is respecting that their experiences are still legitimate even if yours has been different.<p>2. It&#x27;s been a lengthy discussion here, so maybe it&#x27;s not repeating myself too much to say again that &quot;offensive&quot; really isn&#x27;t an accurate characterization of the objections here. Plenty of people who have wonderfully off-color senses of humor might still consider this inappropriate. The issue isn&#x27;t &quot;this makes me feel offended&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;this makes me feel excluded&quot;. That&#x27;s a really important distinction.<p>(And to tie this in with point 1, even if you personally do not experience this sort of thing in a way that feels like it&#x27;s excluding people, it&#x27;s important to listen when substantial numbers of other people tell you that they <i>do</i> have that experience.)",1390697770

Your goal appears to be &quot;create an activity where parent and child can spend time together.&quot;  My goal (if I had children) would be &quot;get them to be able to program independently as soon as possible,&quot; because IMHO that will ultimately both increase the amount they learn (because they&#x27;ll start learning on their own time to scratch their own itch, just like mature hackers do, so the amount of learning your child does is no longer so dependent on the amount of time you spend teaching them) and increase the probability they&#x27;ll stick with it for the long term (because being able to do their own projects and have their own ideas makes it much more attractive, especially as they head into the teenage years and start to establish their own identity).<p>Having an activity parent and child do together which increases emotional family bonds is great, but I think the more important goal is the transfer of knowledge, skills and the hacker mindset.<p>Disclaimer:  I don&#x27;t actually have kids, but if I did, the above would describe my philosophy.",1390697615

There is no sexism in that name. Just because it is named &quot;bro&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s sexist. We have girls who like to be called bro. I remember in one of the earliest episode in Family Guys, Lorie said &quot;I respect your feminist initiative and being feminist means I have a choice and I choose not to be like you.&quot;<p>If you force people to feel like the name is sexist, you are making it sexist. If you are so paranoid about sexism that&#x27;s because we have made many things sexist.

This includes naming schemes for functions<p>2) PHP and most major projects written in it are insecure. Even up-to-date Wordpress installs are vulnerable to attacks.<p>3) Testing still isn&#x27;t in vogue. Few projects have any testing and for those that do the testing tools aren&#x27;t nearly as strong as in other languages<p>4) The tooling that surrounds the ruby, python, go, javascript languages is much more advanced than what PHP has even now. PHP only really got a decent package manager last year.<p>5) For a long time most PHP projects were procedural.  Real OO was only introduced in PHP 5.<p>6) There is a lot of bad code written in PHP because it was so accessable.<p>7) Most examples of PHP projects are CMS&#x27; which don&#x27;t require a ton of experience to build. You meet a lot of people who have spent 10 years in the industry that really have just managed content that don&#x27;t know how to build something complex and don&#x27;t have any background in data structures, algorithms etc<p>8) The PHP community is extremely fractured. There are something on the order of 10+ major PHP frameworks.

I love Ruby to death. I&#x27;d program in it all the time if I could. And it works really well for automation. But for processing massive amounts of data? Not so much.<p>I even did some tests a year or so ago when I was writing a script to merge together data from multiple log files and a couple of databases, including data transformations, merging/collation and sorting of, oh 100GB or so of raw log data a day.<p>My first tests with Ruby were running pretty slow, so I decided to write the script out as I&#x27;d planned in both Ruby and Perl and compare the results on subsets of the data.<p>I used none of Ruby&#x27;s OO features, I just did straight simple data structures, hashes and arrays, etc. Ruby has far better infrastructure for dealing with these things built in, and so I wrote the Ruby script in a couple of hours. The Perl script took me a couple of days--admittedly my Perl is rusty, but I wasn&#x27;t doing anything complicated. But the language just doesn&#x27;t have as much stuff built in.<p>Anyway, at the end I had two scripts with exactly the same logic, and I&#x27;d even had to implement some things (like Ruby&#x27;s Array#uniq, which I assume (but don&#x27;t know) is written in C) from scratch in Perl. So yeah I wasted 16 hours on the Perl script, but you could follow them line by line and they were identical.<p>Run them one after the other to compare, and the Perl script is literally 100 times faster and uses a tenth of the RAM. I told my Python-loving friends about this and they guffawed at the silly Ruby guy, but it was depressing.<p>So yeah, Ruby is slow at runtime compared to other languages.

7123179,comment,7123012,7123012,6,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Several reasons, I think.<p>For one, it&#x27;s no secret that PHP was an amateur undertaking that inadvertently ended up powering >80% of the web.<p>It started off as a bunch of helper functions that were meant for Rasmus Lerdorf&#x27;s personal use. He has frequently acknowledged that he was never particularly skilled and that PHP was never meant to be used on such a large scale. Among the countless WTF moments you would expect from a personal project, PHP once used strlen() as a hashing function. [1]<p>Thus, PHP ended up having a very inconsistent design and an awful typing system. It ended up becoming quite baroque, it has never had a formal specification and it has no coherent idea of what it wants to be. This is exemplified by PHP&#x27;s relatively recent appropriation of Java idioms in an attempt to bring vague Nygaard OOP.<p>Third, it&#x27;s fundamentally a templating language and it doesn&#x27;t encourage any cohesive design patterns or practice. Most PHP sites don&#x27;t even use frameworks, but rather go with the Mozart (or rather, spaghetti) style of copy-paste programming. There is no clear separation of concerns.<p>Fourth, the PHP community has always been dominated by amateurs. I can&#x27;t really direct you to any objective statistics, but in general PHP has a disproportionately high amount of leechers and newbies, largely because it has been so deeply ingrained into the public consciousness as the <i>de facto</i> language of the web, without knowing of the better designed general-purpose alternatives.<p>Fifth, some concrete examples of PHP&#x27;s horrific internals. [2] [3] [4]<p>Alternatives? Anything, really. Python, Ruby, Perl, Common Lisp, Haskell... whatever floats your boat. A minimal web framework is a trivial application to write.

Anecdotal evidence cuts both ways: every time this issue is discussed on HN there are real women in comments saying that they personally don&#x27;t feel discriminated at their tech workplaces and find the claims of GeekFeminism et al about the pervasively misogynistic tech culture laughable. Do you actually know that there&#x27;s an &quot;unrelenting deluge that makes life miserable&quot; for a typical woman in tech? Do you have real evidence that&#x27;s not coming from self-appointed experts or members of outrage brigades? How do you know that you&#x27;re not exaggerating and it is not, just to pick a possibility, a regrettable annoyance that we&#x27;d be much better without, but not an &quot;unrelenting deluge that makes life miserable&quot;?<p>>We look around and we wonder why there are so few women in tech. A big reason is that so few women have the passion to don raingear they&#x27;ll have to wear for the rest of their lives.<p>How do you know that this is a big reason? What&#x27;s your evidence?<p>In the U.S., the percentage of women in tech and CS has been steadily going down since mid-80s, while the society has been getting less sexist since that time by most evidence I can think of: for example, think of the number of women in Congress, representation in the media, jokes that have become too crass, gender pay gap that&#x27;s been shrinking... If you&#x27;re right about the reason women don&#x27;t go into tech, wouldn&#x27;t you expect the numbers to go up and not down since the 80s?<p>>Most rational folks will just choose to go somewhere it&#x27;s not raining as much or as often<p>What are other occupations in which, like you&#x27;re claiming for tech, a misogynistic culture drives women out? E.g. take the law. Anecdotally, the culture in law firms is often said to be dominated by very aggressive male partners, with abundant misogynistic jokes. I googled for sexism in law firms and found this article:\n<a href=""http://ms-jd.org/what-no-one-tells-you-you-go-law-school-youre-entering-sexist-profession"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ms-jd.org/what-no-one-tells-you-you-go-law-school-you...</a>\nby a woman who says that before law school she &quot;spent the several years in a heavily male-dominated profession (software), and never had any issues&quot;, but was shocked by the amount of sexism and sexual harassment in law school and law firms.<p>If she&#x27;s right, and this is a real problem, would you expect such sexism to be &quot;a big reason&quot; for women leaving law as well? But ever since the 1970s there&#x27;s been only an up trend in female representation in law. How do you explain that?",1390695300

In Chinese, turtle head is slang for the head of the male sexual organ. If I name it turtlehead, I can called sexist by some Chinese feminist. But in my example that&#x27;s probably a bad name to start with anyway. But is bro-page in the same category as turtle head? My opinion is not.<p>I really don&#x27;t see the name bro-page being sexist or evidence of ignoring feminist audience. It sounds genuine. It isn&#x27;t like the author have a female model in the bro page documentation.<p>Rather than spending the first 50 comments on this gender flame war, why don&#x27;t we talk about what makes man page useful and not useful.

Students don&#x27;t care about Blackboard because their interactions with it are minimal. They just submit stuff and use it to view slides, videos and grades. For this it works well enough.<p>I was a student user of Blackboard for a while before I saw the teaching side of it and I didn&#x27;t have any negative opinions of it at all at that time. I did think the UI was a little clunky and dated but that was it. As a TA, I now realize it has lots problems. For instance, right now, I am trying to create a custom grade that is a weighted sum of other grades. And oh boy, what a fucking pain something that should be straightforward is turning out to be!<p>> <i>Professors don&#x27;t care. Administrators don&#x27;t care.</i><p>Professors and admins very much do care about providing a good learning experience. Why do you think Piazza has taken off in such a big way? AFAICT we do our best to use the best possible software solutions. Others have already touched upon why such systems are difficult to change, but change is definitely possible and is already happening.<p>At my university, I am seeing more and more stuff moving away from Blackboard and into Piazza and other custom solutions. Many CS courses use a custom homework submission system that enables scriptable grading. Course material is moving from being hosted on Blackboard to Piazza. This is despite the fact that Piazza&#x27;s course page function kinda sucks and provides no real way of organizing slides and handouts. But then neither does blackboard and it&#x27;s helpful to have the slides on the same places as where the questions come from. There are courses where Blackboard is only used to keep track of grades. I believe this wasn&#x27;t true just a few years ago and I suspect there are university regulations which necessitate this.<p>The lesson I learned from Piazza succeeding is that if you make your tool actually useful and really easy to get started, professors <i>will</i> use it. And the success of Piazza directly contradicts what you&#x27;re claiming.",1390694666

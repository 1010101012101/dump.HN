Imagine you are an HR person, maybe if its a start up the CTO, and you receive the application you've been sending out. How would you react? Would the application be memorable? Would it impress you and make you think, this person seems like they are really enthusiastic about working at our company and they have impressive skills?<p>To this end, I'd say make sure you show them something you've built that's up and running and 100% completed. It only has to be just one thing, but make sure its impressive - something you're proud of and would consider your best piece of work. Send it as a link in your initial email.<p>Anything unique and cool that makes you stick out is good. Why not strap up your resume as an interactive app designed specifically for that startup you really want to intern for? Or whoever said you had to send a standard resume word doc? Why not mock up a sweetly designed resume - even if you're a programmer it shows motivation and ability to think outside the box.

I'd also scratch anything from your resume that doesn't impress. The link to <a href=""http://countervailinteractive.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://countervailinteractive.com</a> goes to an expired domain, so I can't see what your skills are like, so I'd get that working or scratch it if you can't.

E.g. say you are covering an insurance client against ""disasters."" What does that mean? The English word ""disaster"" can encompass everything from Fukushima to cancer to your kid failing out of school. Instead, you might write: ""we will cover floods, hurricanes, forest fires, and other disasters."" This is technically redundant, because the enumerated items are subset of ""disasters."" However, under the accepted rules of legal interpretation, the enumerated items will cabin the more general concept of ""disaster."" You have a fighting chance in court of defending not covering someone's getting cancer by relying on the argument: ""is cancer like a flood, hurricane, or forest fire?""<p>Additional wordiness is often the result of the need to be precise (or copy & pasting from precedent, or being in a hurry). Try describing the operation of some C code in English in very precise terms. You'll find that ordinary English leaves implicit a lot of ""who, what, where, when"" type details, and that making them explicit creates a lot of wordiness.",1361400869

And along the way as much of the culling was done by me as it was by the prospective companies.<p>Look, I know I'm just talking in anecdotes. And I'm parsing a lot because I don't want to offend you. But if you have ""dozens"" or even just a <i>lot</i> of people telling you they can't hire you because you're not a good fit, that should be a red flag to you. Sure, some of the problem is probably some of the companies. But you could probably see results by taking ownership of part of the problem for yourself. What I mean is, it's easy for an engineer to just try to wash his hands of things like ""networking"" and ""cultural fits"" but a better way is to just treat it like any other engineering problem and optimize for it.",1361400393

5253877,comment,5252678,5253660,6,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I am not joking. There is absolutely no reason to put an admin interface in an app.<p>Here is an example applicaion, let's call it Foo. It's a blogging tool:<p>* FooCore: This is an API exposing the data Foo that works with, and the ways to change that data. It has a Blog model, a Posting model and an Author model. It has endpoints like ""GET /api/blogs"", ""PUT /api/blogs/:id/postings"" and ""GET /api/authors/:id"" to create blogs and postings. It has no UI.<p>* FooApp: This is the user-facing frontend application. It serves the main site in HTML, JS, CSS and whatever other. It renders blogs from FooCore by calling is API. It has no logic other than presenting the UI and acting as an MVC controller and view (the M being the API). It calls the API both from its server app, as well from the browser via XMLHttpRequest.<p>* FooAdmin: This is the user-facing admin frontend app. It serves the ""back office"" admin UI for managing blogs and posts and users.<p>We now have a very elegant app where the division between the parts is crystal clear. The admin UI's requirements do not affect the public UI's requirements or vice versa. The underlying data model can't build up weird UI cruft because there is no UI to let sloppy devs screw it up with their laziness.<p>(Need a new UI -- say, you want to accept blog postings via email? Create a new app, FooEmailApp that handles only this interaction using the same API. Want to accept blog postings by fax? Create a new app, FooFaxApp. Neither frontends will have code that bogs down the other UIs. If you decide fax is dead, just delete the entire app.)<p>(And you can extend your own ecosystem of services organically. Need role-based permissions? Create an app for it, and wrap every HTTP verb with a check against the permission app.)<p>Anyway, the above app is not complete; you want login via Twitter, so we add Checkpoint into the mix. This happens:<p>1. When FooCore wants needs a user, it looks in its session cookie and determines which user it is.<p>2. If there is no user, we create a redirect to Checkpoint's /login/twitter. Checkpoint does the necessary OAuth interaction behind the scenes, stores the credentials in its store, update its own cookie, and redirects back to FooCore. (Remember, Checkpoint has no UI. It just redirects to Twitter, which displays the usual OAuth login/authorization dialog.)<p>3. FooCore can now use Checkpoint's cookie to determine who the logged-in user is, and it can ask Checkpoint for data such as the user's name and email. It can also create an internal User object that represents FooCore's own data about the user, such as blogs and postings.<p>The upshot: The app knows nothing about authentication. It outsources everything. It can focus on the important stuff.<p>This modular separation of concerns into separate apps sharpens your focus as a developer, and forces you to think about the data and the interactions that are necessary. Because of HTTP/REST's relative poverty, everything becomes a verb, and every verb must be designed separately.<p>Two other benefits: It forces you to think of reuse, since every feature becomes an opportunity to reuse a modular component. Secondly, it forces you to think of ""presentation"" and the divison between ugly internal state and public state, because every interface becomes much more exposed to the world; when an app becomes an API, you are subject to more scrutiny than if you were tucking the stuff away in some class somewhere in your app.<p>No, I'm not kidding. Back in 2006 we tried the old model of putting everything and kitchen sink (login/auth, normal UI, admin UI, promo site, email notifications, role-based permissions, statistics, visualizations, image upload etc.) into our apps. The model does not scale. The benefits of a ""many small apps"" model have been obvious even for relatively small applications.<p>I'm not defending anything. If anything I'm attacking? :-)",1361399890

Refinery is not a good model of a rails app and is probably the main reason for his problems or perception that Rails is heavy - it was a mistake to try to base an app on it and most of his gripes seem centered on that - there's a lesson there and it's not about Rails.<p>Rails has become lighter with 3.x and will become lighter still with 4.x - they're dropping a lot of unnecessary stuff and trying to pare it down to the minimum - an admirable direction and quite the opposite to Java, which makes this article all the more baffling. Of course it's not the perfect framework and there are plenty of options, but the complaints of the article are histrionics.<p>The laundry list of possible technologies in the article is absurd - RefineryCMS, Devise, Omniauth, Carrierwave, Unicorn, Rack Rewrite, Fog, New Relic, Foreman, AMQP, and Honeybadger, Heroku.<p>You can get started with rails on a cheap VPS and serve your first few hundred thousand users with the following very simple stack: <i>Apache, Ruby, Passenger, Rails</i>. Setup is a few lines in your package manager of choice, writing the app is straightforward and requires none of the software above, maintenance is running aptitude update and bundle update now and then.<p>Out of the stack above, Devise is quite a nice authentication solution and is the only one I'd recommend, but it's easy to roll your own, as to the rest of his list, if you don't need it, don't bother using it, none of it is required.",1361399823

It is more abstract; I shuffle around ideas. Sometimes I will speak aloud to myself when I'm trying to disassociate to find a new viewpoint, but that's about as far as the inner voice goes.<p>Of course, this could potentially be less typical than I usually assume.

I doubt that the MOOCs will do it on their own, even though they could eat up a large source of revenue for these colleges, but whatever comes a generation or two after them should be really interesting.<p>I wasn't clear about the tv/video analogy; I meant that there have been people (in the past) as excited about the effect those technologies would have on education as people are currently excited about MOOCs, etc.  I agree that tv, etc haven't had as big of an impact as the internet seems to.  I plan to take a coursera class soon to get first hand experience but haven't gotten around to it yet, so I can't really make a comparison.  I would not be surprised at all if it were just as good as or better than a large lecture, but I'd want decent data before making up my mind.  Not because I think that there's a lot of ""personal attention"" that students get in a 500 seat lecture, but because showing up in person and participating with groups seems to (anecdotally) somehow matter in lots of activities.<p>re: completion rates, I know that a lot of the students who sign up for these classes have no real commitment to take it to completion.  But I'm pretty confident that if you did a random experiment and assigned students to online or in-class courses, the students assigned to online classes would have a lower completion rate.  I don't know how much lower, and it's quite likely that for some classes, the reduction in costs and the increase in access would make up for the decrease in completion rates, and for other classes it wouldn't.<p>The recommendations aren't totally worthless, because (at least as I read it) they're pretty specific to colleges replacing traditional lectures with online courses.  There's a lot of enthusiasm among (many but not all) university administrators to do this -- to offer online versions of existing classes along with or instead of the traditional version -- as a cost cutting move.  I haven't seen a lot of concern or resources for adapting the material to be a good fit for an online course, making sure that the students get adequate support (most resources for student support require the student to be physically on campus), etc.",1361398560

Certainly much communication on the modern internet is realtime, so arguably a protocol based on realtime communication makes more sense than a protocol conceived for asynchronous communication. A system that allows a conversation to move between the two seems ideal -- look at how Facebook collapsed the distinction between IMs and ""messages"". Trying to have a realtime conversation over email (even with a thread-aware, modern client like Gmail) is still an exercise in frustration.<p>The core support for the concept of presence in XMPP is also pretty compelling -- especially in remote collaboration settings, where transparency around another person's comings and goings can significantly reduce conversation friction.<p>That being said, the current XMPP protocol, even including the large set of approved protocol extensions, still falls very short of what would be needed for it to serve as a viable email replacement. As others in this thread have mentioned, the core protocol doesn't include any specification for how to handle messages directed to offline users, and while XEPs have been developed to address this, implementations still vary widely between implementations. Limited by the structure of JIDs, the protocol extension for multi-user chat ends up being a clumsy hack. It looks like there are also problems with large binary data transfer (see <a href=""http://metajack.im/2008/06/10/binary-data-is-xmpps-achilles-heel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metajack.im/2008/06/10/binary-data-is-xmpps-achilles-...</a>).<p>Obviously, a lot of these problems can be resolved with additional protocol extensions, but this risks creating a hodgepodge of conflicting standards and generating a menagerie  of different implementations before drafts are settled on. The fact that the core XMPP RFC makes no allowance for offline messages, which is essentially the core of email, makes me think it might be unwise to try to hot-swap the two.",1361398394

Intuitively, it's fair that January is colder than September, but HADCRUT4 is temperature <i>anomalies</i>, so that's probably what went wrong.<p>That said, I think the article cherrypicks some (it seems to me) very minor issues, adds in an appeal to their own authority, while neglecting to explain why the conclusion that there ""was no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures [in the last 16 years]"" is wrong.

There are records of the director of the nation-wide emergency task-force being being interviewed and saying things like ""After these afternoon quakes there is nothing to be feared, I can assure you. My fellow colleague and quake researcher can tell you the same"", and one of the convicted scientists cues in ""Sure, there is nothing to be feared. Indeed, these small earthquakes have released a lot of energy, making a big earthquake impossible"". _Impossible_. That is not correct scientific communication, that is being the wingman of a politician being interviewed by national TV.<p>The same board of scientists have been found legally responsible for other similar statements, for example for not green-lighting the evacuation of the student's campus. The engineering students noticed strange cracks on the walls and notified the emergency task-force who replied: ""First, the building is safe, we have had it tested few month ago; second, they said on TV that there are not going to be big earthquakes"". The main building of campus collapsed.<p>The government imposed a ""everything is safe, do not worry"" view. This was a political decision and the board members let the politicians use their scientific credibility for their political agenda. This is what is being punished here. It is their behaviour and the words they said on TV that is being addressed, not the content of the technical minutes.<p>Anyway, there is a point of the sentence that is a bit scary. The whole board is being punished, not just the head of the board and the others who spoke before the meeting. The court considers the board a single body, and this is a bit strange and worrisome.",1350982086

Also, carve out some time and spend a day in their shoes. Tell them you want to understand their process better and shadow the design team for a day, plus you can offer to do the same for them.<p>Of course if the tech stack kept changing it would be frustrating for the designers to have to junk <i>their</i> designs on a regular basis. But if you have spent a day with them, then you'll be able to make that argument in their language. This will allow you to empathize with their problems, but will also allow you to get inside their OODA loop [1] and identify things that they may be taking for granted or gaps in their comprehension that are biasing their decisions.<p>You don't need to be in an adversarial relationship with them, but the weakness in their design process is coming at a cost in engineering resources which they clearly aren't including in their calculations. You can point this out in a non-confrontational way by explaining the time cost of your lost work, and reminding them that 'a stitch in time saves nine.' It's not like you can pass the buck onto Apple or your framework supplier every time the spec changes, any more than the designers have the option of pretending the screen has a different aspect ratio or whatever.<p>1.

The Daily Mail is a newspaper in the loosest sense of the word. It is essentially a propaganda rag, flattering its readership by provoking their emotions on topics such as women in the workplace (which is a bad thing and gives them cancer), women not in the workplace (which is a bad thing and gives them cancer), the causes of cancer [1], immigrants, taxes and house prices. Bizarrely, for a publication with such a high female readership, it's remarkably misogynistic.<p>Typical readers are middle-aged to the elderly, who do not like having their assumptions challenged and find catharsis in the simplicity of the world as presented by the Daily Mail. The phrase ""Daily Mail reader"" has become shorthand for someone demonstrating characteristics such as ignorance, extremely simple viewpoints on complex situations, and bigotry poorly veiled under spurious numerical data or contextless ""factoids"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://kill-or-cure.heroku.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kill-or-cure.heroku.com/</a>",1350980285

Your best bet would probably be to use the Disruptor approach of preallocating everything then avoiding any subsequent allocations if that's really what you want to accomplish. However, if you honestly believe ""most real world applications"" can avoid allocating memory in the old generation, I'd sure love to see some graphs of some heap profiles of real world usage of these applications!<p>CMS does a stop the world collection of the old generation, however it will do an incremental collection of the eden generation. If you've ever looked at a graph of the JVM heap observing CMS running under VisualVM or YourKit, you'll notice a distinct sawtooth pattern to its collections. The diagonal parts of the sawtooth represent incremental collections in eden space. The vertical parts of the sawtooth represent stop-the-world collections of the old generation.<p>The ""small regular sweeps"" you're talking about affect the eden generation, not the old generation. Collecting the old generation is a stop the world operation in every JVM GC option except Azul's C4 collector. C4 resorts to all sorts of clever tricks to avoid stopping the world, most notably read barriers and eager pointer updates. On the Azul hardware, these tricks involved hardware transactional memory. On x86 they don't have HTM (at least until Transactional Synchronization Extensions ship on Haswell). What they do, however, is quickly set up GC invariants and a trap on a given page. Whatever thread accesses a page that contains an object which needs to be relocated relocates the object on the GC's behalf and gets the new pointer. All that said, C4 is only available on the Azul JVM, which is commercial.<p>CMS can't do this. It stops the world at a JVM safe point whenever it needs to collect the old generation.",1350980052

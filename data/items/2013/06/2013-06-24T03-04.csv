They focus overwhelmingly on the art of discourse: sure, there are papers and exams but the soul of the class is in the daily lecture; everyone comes in with X, Y, and Z read and you discuss it, growing and pruning theories and interpretations of literature as one would an oddly looking tree.  A good professor wants to teach you that Frankenstein is an allegory for the Industrial Revolution, or the creation of Man; a great professor knows the conversation that Shelley had with Chaucer and Milton and everyone in between -- and knows how to help their students figure out everything themselves, with just enough help along the way.<p>A good English course only needs a semester to teach you how to make a point, argue it, research it, defend it against a multitude of competing and contradicting points, and ultimately handle the reality that the point has been made many times before by people much smarter than you.<p>(This experience is magical, and something that really can&#x27;t happen in a room with more than forty people, let alone a web app with hundreds.)<p>You develop along the way a finely honed level of communication (I had a fellow CS grad once suggest to me that 100-level English classes were about punctuation and grammar, and it made me inappropriately angry); you learn how to approach questions with no answer and conversations with no real goal, how to talk with peers, mentors, and people who died hundreds of years ago.  You learn a tremendous amount about yourself and others through the lens of literature, honed tightly by a great professor and a greater book, because the way you approach any experience is of course colored by everything about you.<p>I switched out of the English department my sophomore year to pursue Computer Science, but British Literature II was the most valuable class I&#x27;ve ever taken.",1372045853

You know, I&#x27;ve been trying for many years now to get people to understand that the decline in humanities enrollments in the US happened almost entirely between 1970 and 1980. I usually work from this table from the NCES Digest of Education Statistics -- <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_286.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_286.asp</a> -- where you can see that English plummeted from an anomalous 7.6 percent of all bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1970-71 to 3.4 percent in 1980-81. (It was 4 percent in 1950; it rebounded to about 4.5 percent in the mid-90s and is back down to 3.2 percent today.)<p>But today I came across this other table -- <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_289.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_289.asp</a> -- and lo! In 1970-71, 17.1 percent of all bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded in the humanities, and in 2009-10 the figure was .... 17.0 percent. For the purposes of the NCES, &quot;humanities&quot; includes &quot;degrees in Area, ethnic, cultural, and gender studies; English language and literature/letters; Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics; Liberal arts and sciences, general studies, and humanities; Multi/interdisciplinary studies; Philosophy and religious studies; Theology and religious vocations; and Visual and performing arts.&quot; That last group, btw, has more than tripled in majors since 1970, while the total number of degrees has merely doubled. And &quot;liberal arts and sciences, general studies, and humanities&quot; has increased sixfold. This makes up a lot of ground from the relative dropoff in English and foreign languages.

And it was not even the full compiler: parser and semantic analysis, but no code generation in the usual sense. It did, however, support several idiosyncratic compiler dialects.<p>C++ is an ugly, ugly, _ugly_ language. Even C language, the base of C++, is context-dependent, which in practice means that you need to intermix parsing and semantic analysis. Consider for example this code &#x27;T*t&#x27;. If &#x27;T&#x27; is a type, then this is declaration of variable &#x27;t&#x27; that is pointer to &#x27;T&#x27;. If it is identifier, then it is non-assigned multiplication of &#x27;T&#x27; and &#x27;t&#x27;.<p>C++ added its own quirks on top of that. You have, for example, parse class definitions two times.

There is no transcript, court record or transparency in the process.<p>I believe there is not a single shred of _written down_ evidence that shows targeting of innocent civilians to be taking place.

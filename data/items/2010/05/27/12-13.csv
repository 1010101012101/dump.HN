Don't get too hung up on getting the absolute best interest rate, just find a place that will give you easy liquidity (ie: DON'T make a 5 year investment right now).<p>Then, buy and read the following books:\n""A Random Walk Guide to Investing"" - Burton Malkiel\n""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" - Andrew Tobias<p>(and/or any equivalent titles that catch your interest).<p>Then once you have a good/better understanding of financial investments interview some financial advisors and talk to them in depth about how they plan to manage your assets. Ideally you're looking for something more along the lines of a ""wealth manager"" vs. a financial advisor.<p>Killing a year finding the right investment approach while your money makes even a very low percentage rate is, for a 20 year old, a better approach than rushing out and making possibly a bad investment that incurs a big loss, or has tax liabilities you don't fully understand.<p>In the shorter term, you should find a good local CPA-for-hire and make sure you understand any possible income tax issues.  In some (many) cases, if you will owe a large income tax return you will need to pre-pay or make estimated payments.  Not doing so can take a big bite out of your ass later (ref: portion above about keeping funds semi-liquid).<p>BTW, congrats on your success.  Take it slow and don't be tempted to believe you know what you're doing or can repeat this easily (learned advice ;) ).  You have much time and luxury to plan your next move, and no matter what anyone tells you, you are not missing out on the investment opportunity of a lifetime in the next 24 months and do not need to make any rash decisions.<p>At the same time, you should sort of off-handedly tell family and friends that you locked in to a great investment and in 5 years or so will be able to access some of the funds.  This proactive approach is better than having to say no to all the outreaches for ""help"" and ""personal investments"" that tend to come with a large chunk o' cash.",1274964806

Back then you didn't have a network, or portable file formats, and even the floppy disks - if they were the same size - were formatted differently for every operating system, and switching to another OS often meant switching to a different machine with a different architecture (and machines were damned expensive back then!), and you couldn't expect to take any applications, peripherals, and probably data with you.  And those are pressures that apply to those who probably only had one system.  If you were a business with more than one microcomputer, or you needed to share data with someone else, then the cost of switching was enormous.<p>In the 80s I lived through, Microsoft was already busy building their empire by keeping customers captive on the upgrade treadmill.

1383331,comment,1381108,1382793,0,0,elblanco,,,"I'm not sure how the asking price for a share is substantially different than the concept of ""value"" I mentioned before. Both are fictitious concepts that have very little to do with the actual price something should have (I'll use the term ""worth"" here to describe that more precise measure, but feel free to substitute average cost or some other term that means ""the objectively calculable price for something"").<p>A share price can be both under and over valued right? Under or over what? Worth.<p>One way to measure is revenue/outstanding shares (though secondary factors like P/E, private investments, etc. figure into this to define more precise measures) another way is based on a softer metric like ""valuation"" which is typically some multiplier of revenue/yr (notice the root word of valuation is ""value"" which is precisely what I'm talking about -- and we both know that valuations can have very little to do with reality (see Facebook for a case study in how valuations can be broken).<p>Share prices are merely a representation of the subjective ""value"" of a share vs. the actual price for some % of a company. If the market thinks something is hot, it doesn't matter if a share is actually worth only $2 or $3 from a pure revenue/yr perspective, demand for those shares can drive shares up to ridiculous levels -- hundreds of percent above what they should be. If a company is not ""hot"" (based on the very subjective moods of the market) those shares might even sell for less than they are worth because people see the value as less.<p>The market does a very efficient job of obscuring the worth of a share in some company by only feeding investors value signals.<p>There is nothing different from this concept than the concept of value at the microeconomic level. If I see an item for sale. I have a pretty good idea what it's worth is based on materials, construction techniques and various other factors that contribute to the manufacturing cost of a product. But again, just like in the market, all of the signals I receive about a product are value signals not worth signals. So I compare that mental model to the asking price to determine if I'm getting a good value for my purchase. Value here being how close to the average per unit cost I'm able to estimate. A pair of shoes might be priced to sell at $150. The next week it goes on sale for $100. That increases the perceived value I get from the purchase. But I might still skip it if I have a good idea that the average cost per unit-pair of shoes is only $10. But companies seek to increase the value of their products at higher prices by various means like brand building.<p>This is the logic that good investors use when deciding to buy and hold or sell shares. If a stock's value is perceived to be too high compared to the average worth of a share, investors expect that the share price will more likely go down than up. Companies seek to influence this by keeping investors interested with positive statements about the company. ""new product!"", ""big contract!"", ""how new business concept!"", ""change in leadership!"", ""increase in business efficiency!"" so that a share of XYZ company, that may only be worth $10 on a revenue/shares matter is valued at $150 by the market.",1274962157

For example, for a scientific/engineering audience, it's important to acknowledge ways you might be wrong, otherwise you aren't credible.  However, for other audiences acknowledging ways you might be wrong could be taken as a sign you don't hold your opinion strongly.  I think the most concise way of overcoming this mismatch is to flip the uncertainty around, e.g. ""If we follow your plan I can't guarantee this rig won't blow up.""",1274961891

9253871,comment,9253625,9253721,0,0,bradleyjg,,,"While there may well be good reasons to MitM HTTPS on a corporate network, the case isn&#x27;t quite so clear for secretly doing so. IIRC chrome disables altogether certificate pin violation notifications if the offending certificate is locally installed. While it probably is the right move to forgo the giant security warning in that case, I don&#x27;t see why they can&#x27;t use an &quot;orange light&quot; type indicator and in the popup explain corporate monitoring (with a further note that if you aren&#x27;t on an institutional computer you probably have a virus). While corporate IT departments could recompile chromium sans message, or just ban chrome altogether, why make it easy for them?",1427151568

9253788,comment,9253625,9253732,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"CT is a simple idea. Currently, it&#x27;s possible for certificates to be issued privately. The PKI was designed to scale (and scale it does), so there is no requirement that a certificate be downloaded from some trusted source: an SSL server can provide the client with a certificate chain that acts as a proof that a public key is owned by a particular named entity.<p>That has some advantages, most obviously, scalability and robustness. It also has one giant disadvantage: the only way to catch misbehaviour is to actually find a bogus certificate being used in the wild.<p>Certificate transparency is Google&#x27;s plan to fix this. The idea is to evolve the PKI in a backwards compatible way. It creates public logs in which every certificate is meant to be registered. The certificates (or SSL handshakes, or a few other things) can then have a short mathematical proof embedded in them that the certificate was logged.<p>If the log proof isn&#x27;t present then browsers remove the security indicators in order to apply pressure to people to get their certificates logged. It&#x27;s supposed to be done by CAs so most SSL users should never notice any of this is happening.<p>Once certificates are being logged publicly the idea is anyone can do data mining over the log, for example to find certificates issued for their own website that they know they didn&#x27;t request. Thus it allows crowdsourced policing of the CA system. Violations of the rules could be detected much faster.<p>Currently however only Chrome implements CT, and only for EV certs (the ones that make the address bar green), and the majority of CAs have been ignoring it, although the big fish are taking part. The customers of the smaller CAs that are pretending CT isn&#x27;t happening will get a nasty surprise once Chrome stops treating their certificate as EV.",1427150492

I have to say, I still find the name to be a stumbling block. Perhaps this discussion can help to reverse that trend.<p>I have also learned a good deal more from these comments and further research. It seems my idea of &quot;currying&quot; was not entirely complete. Per the comment herein: &quot;Currying turns polyadic function into a sequence of unary functions&quot;. Practically speaking, this means a curried function is a single-input function that will return a function which is still awaiting an argument, so that other functions can be added to the &quot;currying chain&quot;.<p>I would call this &quot;function sequencing&quot;. This term could be equally intuitive for functional languages (ML / Haskell) and non-functional languages alike. However, I think that non-functional language users will still appreciate an explanation that references &quot;argument deferral&quot;, since this is one of the practical benefits, and is also the key part of the &quot;functional&quot; context-switch needed to understand the concept (i.e., you can compose functions without providing the arguments/inputs).<p>Is there an equivalent to &quot;uncurrying&quot;? (un-what-ing??) This verbiage sounds like we&#x27;re trying to unpluck a chicken. On Wikipedia (the world&#x27;s collective brain dump), we understand uncurrying to be &quot;the dual transformation to currying, and can be seen as a form of defunctionalization.&quot; Crystal. I&#x27;ll losely interpret this as flattening the unary (single-input) function sequence into one polyadic (multi-input) function. So can we refer to this as &quot;function bundling&quot;?<p>To summarize, I&#x27;m submitting &quot;sequencing&quot; and &quot;bundling&quot; as the two simple verbs that better describe &quot;currying&quot; and &quot;uncurrying&quot;.",1427150278

The way we have integrated Raft with the database engine is by replicating the WAL (write-ahead log). Every write to the database is an append to WAL. For every append we send that data to the entire cluster to be replicated. Pages are simply inserted to WAL on all nodes. This means the master executes the SQL, but the slaves just append to WAL.<p>If a server is very stale or is added new, ActorDB will first send the base actor file to the new server, then it will send the WAL pages (if there are any).<p>We use a combined WAL file for all actors. This means even with potentially thousands of actors doing writes at the same time, the server will not be appending to thousands of files at once. All writes are appends to the same file and that performs very well.<p>---<p>Would this work for PG replication as well I wonder?",1427149726

I even said similar things in grad school (and still do, sometimes). But the reality is that:<p>1. These are not supposed to be projects, they are supposed to be companies creating products. The gulf between &quot;Nature paper&quot; and &quot;something someone will buy&quot; is incredibly long and arduous. Plus, these are VC-backed, meaning there&#x27;s an expectation of timeline (short) and return (high). These aren&#x27;t &quot;take $20m from darpa and engage in another four years of R&D&quot; type endeavors. So while they might look trivial scientifically (although I do not think that they do), they have to be working sooner rather than later.<p>2. &quot;Better versions&quot; is also a tough thing to assess. The people involved matter a lot -- thus even technically superior solutions from very smart people might still not be &quot;better versions&quot;. I know many grad students who are much more knowledgable than some of the top data scientists, who nonetheless would fall on their faces if they tried to do a data science startup. Similar for life sciences and biotech.<p>I think the people who poo-poo academia are largely setting up strawmen -- even Peter Thiel (whose first VC firm, Founders Fund, backed both of my startups) admits that there&#x27;s a substantial role for government and academic activity in enabling long-term technical innovation.<p>As biologists, we know just how hard it is to make _anything_ work in this space. Most new drugs fail, most clinical trials fail, most pathways end up being hard to target, etc. etc. Often building a company in the biotech space is like trying to build a microprocessor company where we&#x27;re still not entirely sure &quot;how the silicon works&quot;.<p>The challenge for YC and other VCs is to identify technologies that are &quot;almost there&quot;, and help turn them into companies and products. That&#x27;s very hard, and I&#x27;m not really even sure that we (as academics) are any good at it either.<p>Will some of them fail? Sure. Will some of them leave the startup scene and maybe go back and do a postdoc or work for an industrial research lab or do another startup, much wiser? Of course.

9253623,comment,9252911,9253558,0,0,dtf,,,"This is pretty much the same dilemma as all content creation packages - whether 3D software, audio, CAD, video editing etc. Internal formats need to be fast and robust to frequent revisions, and will inevitably support procedural transformations on data that are unique to that software (eg a particular mesh modifier, particle system, audio compressor or video effect).<p>So external formats become quite difficult to specify, and generally require that everything gets baked/bounced down to the lowest common denominator - eg per-frame animation channels, or EDL-level edits in a video.<p>The .blend format isn&#x27;t actually that bad, if you <i>really</i> need to access it. I&#x27;ve seen a number of external libraries written in C or Python that do this, and it&#x27;s one of those formats where you can skip over the unknowns (as indeed Blender itself does when loading files from the future).<p>If you want to do 3D interchange, this will depend much on your particular application. We have FBX for mesh, scene and animation data which is pretty good. OBJ is always there for the simplest of things. ABC (Alembic) support is coming to Blender for more complex geometry, and there&#x27;s talk of OpenVDB for voxel data.<p>Other roads out include numerous exporters for various game platforms - THREE.js, the new Khronos gITF format or OpenGEX.",1427148324

This was common.<p>The exceptions were interesting.  A common approach was a byte code interpreter/machine.  This had the advantage of being easier to port, as you only had to port that piece rather than the whole app.  Hardware used to be a lot more interesting back then with all sorts of variations on memory addressing modes, size of units of information (bits & bytes), overlaying (you couldn&#x27;t fit all your code and data in memory at once), file access, and even something as simple as drawing text or graphics on the screen.<p>An example for games is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM</a><p>UCSD Pascal, and later large parts of Microsoft Excel (plus Word I believe) also used the approach, especially in the latter case because it needed less space - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine</a><p>Programming back then was very different to today.  Virtually everything was constrained by cpu, memory and storage.  Writing products involved working out how you could do things despite those, and debugging was not fun.  Just like using 9 inch monitors, it seemed fine at the time, but now I really like having almost unbounded everything, and several freaking huge monitors!",1427148205

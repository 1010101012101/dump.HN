I would expect to be able to do it with the mouse wheel, but somehow it never works out quite right. I keep having to use the sliders and occasionally readjusting the focus.<p>So I can't give Google Maps a very good rating for usability.",1206787550
149353,comment,149052,149052,0,0,pauek,,,"What I would love to read is an essay about ""absolutism"": the belief that there's only One Truth and that it can be <i>really</i> proved. I think many people disagree precisely about this, they think that being an absolutist is bad. Among programmers, the incidence of absolutism seems to be much higher (the closer to math, the higher?).<p>So I think that PG's essay is quite good (as most others), in that it looks for this ""absolute truths"", he tries to analyze stuff and make a contribution, say something that will last. I find this very scientific, which is good in my opinion. The problem is that many people don't see it that way. It is very difficult to stick to the principle of ""egoless disagreement"".",1206787405

149344,story,,,1,0,Tichy,"""OpenAvatars"" idea - opinions?",,"What if there was some kind of standard for user profiles, so that they could be stored on client computers? For example, I could have a ""business profile"" for serious websites, listing my credentials, a photo with a tie, whatever, and a ""fun profile"" for flickr, facebook and whatever else.<p>Websites could understand the OpenAvatar protocol and enable signup with close to zero hassles. Users could choose with one click what information they would like to reveal to a website.<p>It is an extension of thinking about 3d virtual worlds into the 2d web - with 3d worlds, the idea is common to enter different rooms with different avatars (party outfit for parties, warrior outfit for fantasy game, and so on).<p>Of course there is the other trend to not store anything on the client, and hand over responsibility to web sites (ie I read that with clickpass, you also can have a profile picture). Maybe it doesn't even have tobe a contradiction - the protocol could be usable from clients as well as from web services?<p>Edit: I guess it could really work well as an extension of OpenID, like the way clickpass already provides with their photo and email address.",1206786399

I don't know if any such comprehensive text exists. All of the books I used, I found to be quite poor and limited in scope compared to books in other fields. I think it's easy to see why. Frequently I'd just read everything I could scattered around the internet. Maybe you have a more narrow goal for what you want to learn than ""electronics""?<p>Even the narrowly scoped books I found to usually be quite a bit less effective than they should be. Then again, the books I'm referring to where school books.",1206786007
149339,comment,149248,149248,0,0,rms,,,"I think it would be good to have a sub.news setup here, where submitted stories were classified and users could choose how much of each type was on their home page. If users liked lots of general discourse, they would only see the highest rated Startup/Hacker stories. If users only liked hacker/startup stuff, they would never see the general discussion, except when the other ones went off topic. I think the core hacker/startup culture would still survive in such a setup.<p>This drastically improved reddit, but it was already too late to save reddit. I think implementing sub.news.arc roughly as implemented on reddit would only improve news.ycombinator.com.",1206784854

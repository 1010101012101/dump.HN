5630624,comment,5630280,5630280,1,0,sparkman55,,,"I think the current trend is for companies to not post everywhere, since just about everyone is hiring developers these days.  So developers just seek out companies and apply to them.<p>Another current trend is for recruiters at aggressive companies to actively reach out to potential candidates via Linkedin and other similar sites.  The big ones, like Google, even have specialized tools to collect info on various forums (such as this one, I'm sure).<p>This puts startups at a disadvantage, because candidates won't know to seek us out, and fewer candidates are using job boards to find employment.

5630623,comment,5630259,5630259,6,0,avolcano,,,"> To truly master the art of programming, we must learn the techniques available to us, not just the tools. Data structures, algorithms, design patterns, and computer science concepts are what Im talking about here.<p>Exactly how are those <i>techniques</i> not tools of their own? A binary tree is a tool just like a language or a framework is. A quick sort or a merge sort is just another tool - hell, if I'm using a modern language, I can quite easily get any number of sorts in libraries. And what do I gain from learning the implementation details? Divide and conquer algorithms and recursion are wonderful, but simply saying ""learn QuickSort"" is emphasizing the wrong things.<p>I'm biased. I'm 19 and never took a formal CS course. I've self-taught myself some of these concepts - not all (bit twiddling is still a mystery to me). But the best programming learning happens organically. I learned how trees worked not out of a book, but because I needed to implement a parent-child relationship in a note-taking app I built. I learned recursion by learning how to do elegant functional programming in JavaScript to simplify my code.<p>This is how learning happens. You code. You realize your code sucks. You learn to code better. You realize you don't know how to implement something. You learn all you can about it, then you implement it.<p>Learn concepts because they're practical, not because they're on a list of Shit You Need to Know For Your Whiteboarding Interview. Every single one of the concepts on that list has practical applications, but there's no reason to memorize them and know them by heart unless you plan to use all of them tomorrow.<p>Otherwise, you're just falling into the same trap you do using a site like CodeSchool: missing the bigger picture of hacking. You're here to build. Learn what you need to do that.",1367301497

5630618,comment,5630445,5630445,212,0,DanielRibeiro,,,"I remember reading this published insight[1] from Marissa Mayer a few months ago:<p><i>Burnout is caused by resentment</i><p>Which sounded amazing, until this guy who dated a neuroscientist commented[2]:<p><i>No.  Burnout is caused when you repeatedly make large amounts of sacrifice and or effort into high-risk problems that fail.  It's the result of a negative prediction error in the nucleus accumbens.  You effectively condition your brain to associate work with failure.<p>Subconsciously, then eventually, consciously, you wonder if it's worth it.  The best way to prevent burnout is to follow up a serious failure with doing small things that you know are going to work.  As a biologist, I frequently put in 50-70 and sometimes 100 hour workweeks.  The very nature of experimental science (lots of unkowns) means that failure happens. The nature of the culture means that grad students are ""groomed"" by sticking them on low-probability of success, high reward fishing expeditions (gotta get those nature, science papers) I used to burn out for months after accumulating many many hours of work on high-risk projects. I saw other grad students get it really bad, and burn out for years.<p>During my first postdoc, I dated a neuroscientist and reprogrammed my work habits.  On the heels of the failure of a project where I have spent weeks building up for, I will quickly force myself to do routine molecular biology, or general lab tasks, or a repeat of an experiment that I have gotten to work in the past. These all have an immediate reward.  Now I don't burn out anymore, and find it easier to re-attempt very difficult things, with a clearer mindset.<p>For coders, I would posit that most burnout comes on the heels of failure that is not in the hands of the coder (management decisions, market realities, etc).  My suggested remedy would be to reassociate work with success by doing routine things such as debugging or code testing that will restore the act of working with the little ""pops"" of endorphins.<p>That is not to say that having a healthy life schedule makes burnout less likely (I think it does; and one should have a healthy lifestyle for its own sake) but I don't think it addresses the main issue.</i><p>Then I finally realized how many times I've burnt out in my life, and I became much better into avoiding it. Which is really hard to do.<p>And it seems to me that this is one of the many points that Ben Horowitz talks about on his <i>Whats The Most Difficult CEO Skill?

5630616,comment,5629224,5630582,3,0,lsc,,,">seriously, what did she expect?<p>now, first?   you are saying ""this is completely normal and expected""  -  and if by 'normal' you mean 'average'  I agree.  this is how customer service usually is.<p>But it's not acceptable.  Certainly not acceptable from the perspective of the poor kid getting yelled at.<p>>it is assymetrical, one side has build up emotions, one hasn't. if you get affected by this, the job is not for you - and it is great to realise this as early as possible to prevent yourself from causing harm to others by being a shitty helpdesk, inbound call center, management person.<p>Here, you seem to think that it is mostly the employees fault.   I'd argue it's mostly management's fault.<p>Yeah, a lot of the problems you list are real;  sure.    But they are hugely exasperated by companies that setup their callcenter such that employees can't be anything but emotional punching bags for angry customers.    The place I worked as a tech support person?  you were judged by your call times, not by actually solving problems.   (fortunately, I got promoted to NOC before I got fired for, you know, actually helping people.)<p>It was exasperating, because, at the time, I had a bunch of experience helping old people operate windows boxes (I was a helpdesk tech in highschool for an office with a median age around 45.)  /and/ I had a basic understanding of IP, routing, and the like.  And I liked helping people.  But my supervisor kept giving me a hard time about how long I'd spend on the phone with a person.<p>I mean, I was pretty good at focusing on the actual problem, and generally?  when they figure out that you are actually solving the goddamn problem, even angry people calm down.  And you know?  actually solving the problem feels pretty good, even if many of the people start out angry.   (the hard cases are the problems you can't solve, of course, especially when the problem is probably between the keyboard and the chair and they won't try the thing you ask.   It's /way/ easier to do this in person.)<p>Seriously, if you (the company) aren't going to put in the effort to maintain a decent callcenter?  why bother at all?  people buy products without phone support all the time.   The way it's set up most places, not only are most employees not technically qualified, you don't train, and you don't expect employees to be technically qualified.<p>But my main point, here?  is that as a callcenter employee?  you need to recognize a bad callcenter and /leave/  -  if management's goal is to get complainers off the phone, well, you aren't going to be successful if you try to actually help people.<p>(I mean, I think firing your expensive customers; the customer who need the most help is a reasonable business model.  Hell, I put a lot of effort into scaring that sort off at signup.  But having a really bad callcenter is about the worst way to do that firing, especially from the point of view of the kid who has to answer the phone.)",1367301319

A few things make it stand out for me: Variety of content and content depth allows you to get a taste for different languages, tools, and syntaxes, while learning enough to kindle the fires of interest. Kindling and nourishing exciting concepts and ideas is what allows for real learning to occur.<p>Second, I much prefer the more bare bones approach to teaching than the highly polished, high production, hand-holding that defines Code School. Generally, less time is spent on useless background information which noobs will never appreciate anyways and professionals don't generally give a crap about until they decide to ""buy in"".<p>Additionally, they tend to purposely leave in (or even intentionally create) errors while presenting that give important context to the underlying logic. This is the sort of thing that always either get cleaned up in post, or is not embraced for the teaching tool it is.<p>The only drawback is that it operates as a sort of freelance hub, and not all of the commissioned teachers are equally eloquent OR qualified.

I know nothing about mains electricity, so I pulled together an Arduino and a LED with a bit of socket work to get a green light flashing. Once someone completes a sale, a piece of Javascript is requested from a Node.js HTTP server I setup. The server then pings the computer with the Arduino plugged into it over UDP and the client sends a serial response to the Ardunio, flashing the light. It's pretty simple, but it was fun to get all the components together and learn more about hardware development. Since a flash of the LED is requested on every sale and the UDP responds pretty quickly, it acts as a great thermometer during high sales peaks.<p>I'm now in the process of abstracting the entire thing into a self-contained box that communicates over wifi and uses mains electricity.

5630579,comment,5624727,5626684,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">That is, taxes can in practice be increased <i>a lot</i> until the rich start fantasizing about going Galt.<p>The problem is not that they stop participating in the economy, the problem is that higher taxes induce more economically inefficient behavior solely for the purpose of tax avoidance. Corporations will engage in whatever contortions necessary and waste enormous resources and engage in otherwise-irrational activities with billions of dollars behind them solely for the purposes of reducing taxable income. If you can spend a billion dollars to save $1.2B in taxes then corporations will do it. So corporations hoard assets in offshore subsidiaries because repatriating it causes it to be taxed and issuing it as a dividend causes it to be taxed again, but doing neither allows the shareholders to take the profit as share price appreciation which can be tax deferred indefinitely and even then comes in at a lower rate. Result is that corporations like Apple end up as de facto mutual fund managers even though their business expertise has absolutely nothing to do with that. The amount of inefficiency caused by making poor (or just excessively conservative) investment decisions with billions of dollars <i>per corporation</i> is difficult to even imagine. Then there is the matter of jurisdiction shopping, so again, the problem is not that they stop engaging in economic activity, the problem is they move across borders, and each instance of that causes you to get 30% of nothing instead of 20% of something, meanwhile the businesses that stay are put at an economic disadvantage (or reduced economic advantage) against their foreign competitors.<p>>You also don't seem to take into account elasticity, the decreasing utility of money, or any notion of optimizing social utility.<p>That's because we're discussing <i>business growth</i>. And D&S have the opposite problem: They try to account for utility to the taxpayer (though they go on to assign that value to zero for high income earners), but they never account for the investment value of money. When a business owner pays more in taxes and in so doing has only enough earnings to reinvest into opening three new facilities instead of four, the owner may not have any change whatsoever in standard of living, but the employees who would have worked at the fourth facility might have a different opinion.<p>D&S also calculate the ""optimal"" tax rate as the one that generates the most revenue from high income earners, which ignores the essential question of whether the government can make more economically productive use of the money than the private sector. They punt on the question by assuming that because high earners have a lower marginal utility for the money than low income earners, shifting the tax burden at any given spending level toward high income earners will always result in a net gain in social utility, but that falls apart pretty quickly because the lowest income earners already have a negative effective tax rate. So that assumption devolves into the idea that redistribution of wealth has positive social utility and we should always take from someone who has more money and give to someone who has less money to take advantage of the social utility gain, i.e. naked Marxist rhetoric with no economic basis.<p>>If I'm Bill Gates, I could not give enough of a shit that you taxed from me $5k dollars, or even $500k. But, use that to pay for nine or ten heart surgeries, and suddenly social utility is increased by, I would guesstimate, 100x (total lifetime earnings of those ten people, starting after surgery).<p>This is a perfect example because of what Bill Gates actually does with his money. If you take $500k that could have gone to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates may not give one damn about the money, but what about the people he was going to buy mosquito nets for? And what if the government spends the money building F35s that don't fly rather than on heart surgery?<p>>Also, there's not really any empirical support for a inverse relation between business taxes and economic growth. It's just one data point, granted, but we could take as an example Bush's years. Massive tax cuts, but very poor growth.<p>Why are you assuming the result of low tax rates would be seen immediately? A business doesn't always decide to build a new facility when taxes change, they just decide where to build the new facility based on what prevailing tax rates are. You might also want to look into Chamley and Judd (as discussed in D&S at 14), regarding the consequences of taxing investment earnings that would have been reinvested. The short version is, because investments collect interest with exponential growth, taxing would-be investment capital has an exponential cost to the economy if future earnings would always be similarly reinvested.<p>D&S go on to discount this because most families or individuals will eventually choose to consume their savings rather than continually reinvesting their earnings forever, but that doesn't really apply when the entity collecting the earnings is a publicly traded corporation, and even for individuals the original reasoning still holds to extent that earnings are reinvested.",1367300139

5630531,comment,5620842,5627892,1,0,glenra,,,"> I have read a lot about Upton Sinclair but never heard the criticism that his novel was unrealistic. References?<p>Try this summary:<p><a href=""http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/of-meat-and-myth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/of-meat-and-myth</a><p>A few paragraphs relevant to what you just wrote:<p><i>historians with an ideological axe to grind against the market usually ignore an authoritative 1906 report of the Department of Agricultures Bureau of Animal Husbandry. Its investigators provided a point-by-point refutation of the worst of Sinclairs allegations, some of which they labeled as willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact, atrocious exaggeration, and not at all characteristic.<p>Instead, some of these same historians dwell on the Neill-Reynolds Report of the same year because it at least tentatively supported Sinclair. It turns out that neither Neill nor Reynolds had any experience in the meat-packing business and spent a grand total of two and a half weeks in the spring of 1906 investigating and preparing what turned out to be a carelessly written report with predetermined conclusions. Gabriel Kolko, a socialist but nonetheless a historian with a respect for facts, dismisses Sinclair as a propagandist and assails Neill and Reynolds as two inexperienced Washington bureaucrats who freely admitted they knew nothing of the meat-packing process. Their own subsequent testimony revealed that they had gone to Chicago with the intention of finding fault with industry practices so as to get a new inspection law passed.<p>According to the popular myth, there were no government inspectors before Congress acted in response to The Jungle, and the greedy meat packers fought federal inspection all the way. The truth is that not only did government inspection exist, but meat packers themselves supported it and were in the forefront of the effort to extend it so as to ensnare their smaller, unregulated competitors.</i><p>Oh, and the fact that to you ""it's not far fetched to believe"" something does not constitute evidence for it. :-)",1367299005

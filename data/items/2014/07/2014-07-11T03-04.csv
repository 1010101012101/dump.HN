That&#x27;s how it works on a normal website, that&#x27;s how it should work here.<p>And it&#x27;s very wonky, on Safari OSX. Broke it immediately. Command clicked an image to open in new tab and it did not open a new tab, but loaded it in the same tab. Then going back, it hung or something and I had to refresh the page. When I refresh, it goes back to the beginning. It should go to where I was, at the very least. And yes, opening in tabs should work too.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t update the URL to say where I am, can&#x27;t bookmark my position in the browse view. I want to. If it works on a normal page, it must work in this infinite scroll. Breaks basic user expectations.<p>Is this new? I remember liking the Artsy site quite a bit. It&#x27;s still nice and pretty but I cannot depend on that infinite scroll. It is exactly like that xkcd.

8018804,comment,8018213,8018213,3,0,cyphunk,,,"I&#x27;ve run an IRC bouncer and SSH reverse tunnels over Tor for years. Not for the privacy but just for the ease of use. Also it reduces concerns with maintaining up to date linux hosting. While the risk of my .onion being discovered through the cat-and-mouse game that is de-anonymizing .onion&#x27;s may permit some 3 letter agency to discover and root my host I at least reduce the attack service drastically by completely removing internet script kiddies from the threat model. So their is a security benefit in addition to the NAT transversal. The NAT transversal really makes a different and very easy reverse workflow possible. With some simple haggling with scripts and SSH you can reverse almost anything that is low bandwidth. I totally agree there is something to the ease of use provided that services have not fully explored yet.<p>And since most single-peer to home services never require an exit node bandwidth is never an issue. File transfer, remote mail, even a reverse tunnel to use a home IP as your exit node, all work with little to no bandwidth constraints. I really believe there are services to be built on this ease of use. Things that utilise these features without requiring one understand SSH reverse tunnels and the likes.<p>Finally, somehow I think the more services built on such a model the better we will understand how to fix some of the major flaws of the internet as a whole. Namely discrimination based on GeoIP comes to mind. If the internet were built in this manner instead of addressing a service I could have it address me through my own .onion reverse I think location discrimination would become a much more complex task. GeoIP is becoming much more fundamental. as the xkeyscorerules100.txt shows GeoIP is no longer just something used by media companies to prevent someone watching TV out of country and is today used to determine citizenship and basic civil liberties.",1405050946

REST is really just an architectural guide for using HTTP as it was intended so that those tools can, ideally, provide some efficiency. The entity being transferred isn&#x27;t really what matters. It&#x27;s the metadata included about the entity, it&#x27;s related resources, the client and server capabilities, the explicit expression of intent and result, and all the other header info that allows those tools to do their thing.<p>HTTPs ubiquity, for better or worse, makes it about the only option for any web based tool where control from end-to-end isn&#x27;t a practical option. Better protocols can be made, better hardware and software can be made to utilize them, and some have, but their reach is very limited for now. Understanding the thing we&#x27;re stuck with is pretty important. Luckily, countless man hours have gone into studying the protocol and building the tools that take advantage of it. Much of that information has been shared openly. I think that&#x27;s a pretty big advantage over anything else.",1405050787

One way to have a very restrictive society with a high incarceration rate is to have a clear set of laws that are explicitly strict and strictly enforced. Another way is to have a set of laws so large, complex, and vague that it is literally physically impossible for anyone to know whether he or she is breaking a law by performing any given action, or laws so broad in scope that everyone is almost guaranteed to be guilty of something. While there is certainly some of both, I think the latter is a more accurate description of the United States.<p>> As soon as you have a private prison or a defense contractor selling military-grade equipment to civilian police forces, you create the incentive for those organizations to lobby for more &quot;customers&quot; through broader prohibitions, tougher enforcement and harsher penalties.<p>You don&#x27;t even need &quot;private&quot; prisons or defense contractors in the sense you&#x27;re probably thinking. Even organizations that are operated directly by government are subject to those personal incentives, because it&#x27;s still <i>individuals</i> who rely on the government funding, both laborers for their livelihood, and higher level officers for career advancement, prestige, and power. Heck, even politicians who are elected directly often have perverse incentives, because the actions required to get reelected are potentially quite different than the actions which would accomplish the traditional goals of &quot;good&quot; government (like upholding law, being fair, increasing prosperity, etc.).",1405048138

That is a <i>lot</i> of work but if you do it competently it will greatly outperform (by integer factors) the same design going through the operating system. This is how high-performance database engines are designed.<p>As with all such low-level hackery you really need to understand what you are doing to get a good result, but if you do understand what you doing the results can be excellent.",1405047808

People with nothing to lose roll the dice and do dumb shit.<p>I grew up in NYC and a rural part of Upstate NY that were about as opposite as you could get. The small town still had &quot;bad&quot; neighborhoods, they were run down trailer parks with old trailers and poor people. They committed the same types of stupid crimes, like robbery, vandalism and fighting. The drug trade was there, but mostly centered around smuggling and growing weed. (There are only so many drug users in a town of 2,500 without a major transit route, so the retail business wasn&#x27;t great!)<p>In the inner city, you get the added instability of the retail drug market. IMO, population density and the retail drug business are the reason why black males get arrested more. Desperate white people are just as desperate as their black equivalent.",1405047792

3027529,comment,3026632,3027484,4,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Thanks for the excellent introduction to my next topic: An important function of programming education is to teach people <i>which things other people often find difficult</i>. Because intuition is not a reliable guide. And the secret to all effective communication -- which certainly includes programming, as well as writing and teaching -- is to write stuff that your audience can understand.<p>When the teacher says ""this is tricky"", consider the possibility that they aren't merely trying to motivate the students. It might just be a simple statement of fact: <i>There's a significant population that doesn't get this at first glance, and you have to know that, regardless of whether you get it yourself or not.</i>",1316721550

On top of the UEFI environment, most shipping systems have a compatibility layer (CSM) that exposes a legacy BIOS emulation to allow traditional MBR-style booting.  It is possible to load an EFI environment on top of a legacy BIOS (UEFI DUET), but that isn't usually how it is done.<p>There is no special bootloader; OS bootloaders are just UEFI applications in a specially-named path on each drive that the firmware finds and lists as boot options.<p>The mouse-driven GUI is a feature of some specific implementations, not part of UEFI itself.",1316721539

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_light"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_light</a><p>""Light traveling within a medium is no longer a disturbance solely of the electromagnetic field, but rather a disturbance of the field and the positions and velocities of the charged particles (electrons) within the material. The motion of the electrons is determined by the field (due to the Lorentz force) but the field is determined by the positions and velocities of the electrons (due to Gauss' law and Ampere's law). The behavior of a disturbance of this combined electromagnetic-charge density field (i.e. light) is still determined by Maxwell's equations, but the solutions are complicated due to the intimate link between the medium and the field.
Understanding the behavior of light in a material is simplified by limiting the types of disturbances studied to sinusoidal functions of time. For these types of disturbances Maxwell's equations transform into algebraic equations and are easily solved. These special disturbances propagate through a material at a speed slower than c called the phase velocity.""<p>As another commented pointed out, you're splitting hairs. The ""speed"" of light and how fast it is ""moving"" depends on how you define those terms.

It is also relevant to a lot of other equations, like time dilation in a gravitational field. Now, if this experiment resulted in changing our concept of c as the ""speed of light"" to the ""speed of neutrinos"", then your probably right. But I have to imagine that c has been verified experimentally in non-light related experiments.<p>For example, there is a certain speed where if you exceed it you are able to violate causal time relationships. I can't think of any experiments that would validate this. However, there is also the fact that theoretically, if you attempt to accelerate matter to the speed of light it's mass will increase infinitely. So if you accelerate it a little bit it's mass should increase a little bit, and you should be able to confirm the speed of light through an experiment where you measure infinitesimal increases in mass during large acceleration.<p>So my comment is that if he just broke the speed at which light travels, then everything is fine. But if he broke the speed at which you are able to violate causality, or the speed at which the mass of an object is infinite, then our entire understanding of physics is likely to be invalid.<p>Related reading - tachyon pistols<p><a href=""http://sheol.org/throopw/tachyon-pistols.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sheol.org/throopw/tachyon-pistols.html</a>",1316719124

3027347,comment,3026923,3027208,15,0,pedalpete,,,"I agree with your comments about the 'bench', unfortunately, in many companies, the great people you have on the bench get snatched up by competitors, particularly if you are unable to inspire them with a coherent vision. Tim Cook was lured too Apple from Compaq, and though he was only at Compaq for 6 months, I suspect he was not engaged by HPs strategy there (I'm not positive that this was post-merger, but I think it was).<p>Theoretically, some companies are better able to keep bench warmers happy waiting for their time to shine. Obviously Apple has done a very good job at maintaining their top people. I think Microsoft has done a decent job as well, though loosing Ray Ozzie I think was a tough one.<p>Of course, not everybody has the capability of being a great CEO either. Particularly of coming in and operating somebody  else's company. So some of the people who are sitting on the bench hoping to get called up have unrealistic expectations.<p>Bartz was far from genius, but nobody else has come up with a brilliant strategy for the troubled Yahoo! either. Apotheker had a strategy in mind, did a VERY poor job of selling it to the public. We'll never know if it was a flawed strategy or not, though it definitely seems so at this point. I think he is partially being made a scapegoat here as well. The board was sold on the vision and gave him the go-ahead, and now that Wall Street is showing its doubts, the board is getting rid of the CEO. The board needs to take some responsibility here, and from the history, it is obvious the HP board has some serious issues.<p>HP is in a slightly better position that Yahoo!, but they desperately need to find their next growth opportunity. 
They thought they'd rule the world with WebOS, but their execution was so flawed that they blew it. I have a touchpad (got the $99 deal), and you'd have to be incompetent to think that device could compete with the iPad at the same price.<p>So the problem is two-fold. First off, there doesn't seem to be capable internal leadership to pull from, and external expectations are high for a new leader who will drive change similar to the return of Steve Jobs to Apple. But there was nothing to loose at Apple. The company was almost gone if I recall correctly. Either it would completely fail anyway, or it could come back a success. HP doesn't have the luxury of throwing everything out. They are a successful company, but investors want to see new growth in a very competitive market (both hardware and IT services). So the job isn't a simple one.<p>Do these CEOs earn their huge salaries? I don't think so. I'd like to see more CEOs put their money where their mouth is and take the majority of their salary in options, and I think the board should require that.<p>Please don't refer to yourself as 'a dumb developer'. I think your question is completely valid, and I wish I could provide a better answer. Hopefully this gets you part way there.",1316718810

Suppose a lighthouse revolves once per minute. At one lightyear distance from the lighthouse, the angular velocity of the beam is 2*Pi lightyears per minute, which is much faster than the speed of light. However, this is not a problem: the beam is not a physical entity. There is no single particle actually travelling faster than the speed of light.

The idea that any scheme allowing law enforcement to decrypt a cell phone must inevitably involve a single master key is a strawman argument.<p>I&#x27;m aware of these things. But splitting a master key into five parts doesn&#x27;t make it any less of a master key. The vulnerability is not in how many keys you need to open a lock, the vulnerability is in requiring the same keys to open all locks.<p>> This is a non-issue for encrypted disks, which is what law enforcement has an issue with.<p>Forward secrecy for encrypted disks is implemented by regularly changing your encryption key and destroying all copies of the old key. An attacker who can copy the encrypted contents of your disk and later compromises your key then won&#x27;t be able to decrypt the copied data with it, because the current key won&#x27;t decrypt the old ciphertext.<p>This inherently doesn&#x27;t work if the government keeps a key that will decrypt the old ciphertext because the attacker with the old ciphertext can still compromise the government&#x27;s key(s) to decrypt it.",1428983709

They <i>might</i> not see another offer from the hiring company, and if it&#x27;s a small industry or city, they <i>might</i> have some unexpected doors closed on them.

9372016,comment,9371595,9371960,0,0,femto,,,"I&#x27;d guess that the problem is solder joints under (in?) the chip cracking.  The solder joints attach the chip to the circuit board, and also provide the electrical connectivity to the chip.  A cracked joint means the electricity does not flow and so things don&#x27;t work.<p>The &quot;in the fridge&quot; temporary fix is causing thermal expansion/contraction, which is providing enough mechanical movement to close gaps in the solder joints, thus getting the electricity flowing again, and making the WiFi work.  The fix stops working when everything gets back to room temperature, meaning the cracks in the joint open up again.<p>The permanent fix is heating the chip until the solder joints melt, so the solder can flow back together, repairing the cracks in the joints.  Hence the use of a bit of solder on the nail to monitor the temperature, so one can stop when it reaches the melting point of solder.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that such extended duration heating would be a no-no in production, where high yields are important, but in a case like this, do whatever works.",1428983664

9372004,comment,9371039,9371039,0,0,deciplex,,,"> <i>1. Using “guys” to mean “people”.</i><p>I agree with the author that a guy is a man is a guy. Using &#x27;guys&#x27; is a micro-aggression. A rather minor one, in my opinion, but if it&#x27;s contributing to an unwelcome environment then we should try to cut it out. However:<p>> <i>Relatedly, avoid assuming male users in your documentation. Just stop worrying and embrace the singular “they”.</i><p>I mean, no I&#x27;m not going to do that. Which is to say, I will not and do not assume male users in my documentation, and I will use singular <i>they</i> when appropriate. However I will <i>also</i> continue to use generic <i>he</i> from time to time, because this is a legitimate feature of the English language.<p>Singular <i>they</i> has been around for a really long time - for a lot longer than anyone has cared about feminism certainly (i.e. 600 years or so at least). So it is not, as is sometimes claimed, some sort of recent invention by feminists to change the English language from the top down. Rather, it has existed alongside the generic <i>he</i> for about as long as people have been speaking English. I use them both freely: in speech I probably use singular <i>they</i> about 95% of the time, in writing more like 75%. Sometimes one sounds better, sometimes the other does.<p>If <i>he</i> is a pronoun which is used by English speakers in both a gender specific sense <i>and</i> a gender neutral sense, then that&#x27;s what it is. The argument against generic <i>he</i> seems to presume that in fact there is no generic <i>he</i>, and that all instances of generic <i>he</i> in speech and writing are in fact instances of presumed maleness. I&#x27;ve never really seen this argued though, it&#x27;s just always taken as a given. I do not take it as a given - is it really so hard to imagine that a word would have two functions? Most languages do this all the time, and English is no exception.<p>When there are instances of sexism ingrained in our language we should make the effort to remove them, but this often-cited example of same does not foot the bill in my opinion. I will go to great lengths for the cause of feminism, but I will not needlessly degrade the beauty of my native tongue.",1428983286

It&#x27;s not enough to just emit some code interspersed with PICs and to add fast dynamic dispatch. You also need to speculatively compile and deoptimize in a way that is specific to each dynamic language.

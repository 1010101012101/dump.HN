It's enough information to eliminate the case where both children are the gender opposite the one they mentioned.<p>It can still be the case that the chances of there being a boy and a girl are 1/2, while the chances of there being a boy after you find out about a girl are 1/3, purely because you don't know whether you found out about an older or younger girl.  Probability is just a function of our ignorance (at least in this case; I'm not qualified to have an opinion about whether it always is).<p>[Edit:  Hm.

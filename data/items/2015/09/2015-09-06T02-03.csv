When hardware integration matters, you&#x27;re going to have sub-par results if you don&#x27;t have a strong relationship with the hardware manufacturers. The best firmware is from companies that control both the software and the hardware. Linux fundamentally cannot have this relationship.

Swift has the full, unconditional support of Apple. Look at the splash pages for Swift[1][2]. There&#x27;s no comparable page for Obj-C. The docs on Swift[3] make it clear that you&#x27;re totally set and don&#x27;t need to worry. It&#x27;s obvious to any developer that choosing Swift is a good, safe, correct choice and you won&#x27;t be left hanging. Microsoft chose not to do this for F#.<p>Now compare to how MS markets C#[4] vs F#[5]. C#&#x27;s clearly sold as the general dev language for &quot;rapid application development&quot;, whereas F# is to &quot;solve complex problems ... such as calculation engines and data-rich analytical services&quot;. This sums up MS&#x27;s attitude, which percolates to customers. F# is just for hyper-intelligent folks doing mathy stuff - not for us normal devs! C# should instead be pitched focusing on it&#x27;s &quot;familiarity and userbase&quot; just like VB has &quot;English-like syntax which promotes clarity&quot;[6].<p>Inside VS and .NET overall, it&#x27;s clear that F# is simply not getting the same level of support. So while Eric might be pointing out that &quot;normal people&quot;, meaning the bulk of MS customers, are staying with C# this is just MS fulfilling it&#x27;s marketing goals. MS refuses to reassure customers that F# can and should be considered for any application where C# is considered.<p>Until that attitude changes, I would not be surprised if customers continue to do what MS says to do. I doubt it&#x27;ll change. C# has no real competitor (Java&#x27;s lightyears behind). They&#x27;ve got a proven track record of ignoring F#. Add in the politics and face issues going on (going off the history as well as comments from third parties that have been involved on both sides) and well, what can we really hope for?<p>1: <a href=""http://www.apple.com/swift/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/swift/</a>

10176640,comment,10175563,10175563,0,0,dkural,,,"Well, if something is genuinely &quot;useful&quot;, the people who find it useful are generally willing to pay for it; unless they choose to spend their resources on something that they deem even more useful. Thus in general I think things should have a price; in order to facilitate the construction and maintenance of said thing. More subtly; this also gives the users of that thing more of a say in how that is built -- i.e in accordance with their needs as opposed to arbitrary design or engineering decisions, etc. In other words, having paying customers keeps you accountable.  This is why so much publication-associated academic software is garbage from a usability perspective - no one has an incentive to care about users; therefore people don&#x27;t.<p>A curious observation about most users: <i>Most</i> Users often prefer the good/service that works better / easier to use; even if closed; to the open source one that is perceived to be not as good.  Many, many programmers / academics (those poor academics..) use mac laptops. They&#x27;re nice.<p>Open Source is also great from securing long-term existence, and from a reproducibility, and hackability perspective. Pursuing a commercial open source model, if viable, could really address both short + long-term sustainability.<p>I truly don&#x27;t think mathematics departments in the US are &quot;too poor&quot; to pay for software; there are nice offices, budgets for events, very expensive journals, etc. Many universities have massive endowments. It is just that they often choose to spend it elsewhere. I&#x27;d recommend charging a higher price to commercial entities and universities, charging students a small fee;  and giving it for free to &quot;3rd world&quot;, developing, etc. countries. Selling into the library budget, or IT budget, might not be the worst idea.<p>If your student has a cell phone, they can afford to pay 20 bucks a month for the cloud sage edition; instead of buying more booze, pizza, or another movie ticket.  If they are not doing that; it either means they value some other service more highly; or they don&#x27;t value their education & their time.",1441505223

For the second time this week I am just haystacking through issue after issue because I don&#x27;t have a clean backup. I am super broke so I actually couldn&#x27;t afford a big enough drive, but still there is no excuse.<p>First time I had a non-consecutive exception in my Mavericks main partition. I made a rescue but after upgrading a partition to Yosemite, linux wouldnt boot and refind wouldn&#x27;t show up because of this new logical disk partition. It took like 4 hours to scp all my data to another computer, then reformat and set my environment up again.<p>2. Accidentally moved /usr/libexec instead of /usr/libexec/sharingd. With filevault on, this became a mega headache. Now my disk is partitioned in half (after fighting to decrypt the drive) and downloading yosemite to the partition. All because I modified a root directory path and put it back off by a directory. I am almost done fixing it now after another ~1.5 hours of install & config. Apple was awesome about allowing me support a month out of warranty but the &quot;executive team&quot; didn&#x27;t seem to even know what a terminal was.<p>Tl;dr But seriously, image your computer, server, keurig coffee machine, whatever because when your data is as corrupt as your gov&#x27;t, even they can&#x27;t help you.",1441505163

The only implementation of Wayland Protocol at this point is the reference implementation that heavily uses Linux only system calls and is not practically portable to BSD or any other system. Therefor Compositors that use libwayland such as Weston and Gnome are also not portable. SystemD dependencies add another layer of incompatibility.<p>So yes Wayland Like X is in theory OS agnostic but in practical terms they are only as portable as there specific implementation.",1441505113

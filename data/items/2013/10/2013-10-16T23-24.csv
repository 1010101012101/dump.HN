No, this isn&#x27;t a perfectly efficient model of accountability, but there&#x27;s been this meme going around recently that electoral accountability simply doesn&#x27;t exist, which is just ridiculous.  You don&#x27;t even have to go hunting for examples:  the dramatic shift in who held the power in the recent debt ceiling/shutdown hostage negotiations was 100% because of the way polls were shaping up.  Contrast that with the 2011 shutdown when 1) Obama was facing an election and thus had to tread more carefully and 2)  public opinion was split roughly equally against both sides.  In that case Republicans were able to extract relatively significant concessions based entirely on the fact that Obama didn&#x27;t want to blow up the world economy (depending on your level of cynicism, perhaps because he knew that he&#x27;d get flak for it in the upcoming election).<p>tl;dr: Gov&#x27;t isn&#x27;t assumed to care about the people&#x27;s needs &quot;because it&#x27;s chartered to do so&quot;, but rather because they have specific and explicit dependencies on public approval.  By contrast, companies have an explicit dependency on their customers (and shareholders).

When your monitor is displaying a red image, lots of red light is coming out. F.lux makes white images tinged red. F.lux isn&#x27;t about removing brightness in general.&quot;</i><p>Lets get some basics out of the way here, since you seem to be confused about either what &quot;white&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, and &quot;red&quot; light <i>is</i>, or you seem to be confused about what f.lux actually does.<p>&quot;red&quot; light is light that consists largely or entirely of visible light with long wavelengths.  &quot;blue&quot; light is light that consists largely or entirely of visible light with short wavelengths.  &quot;white light&quot; is light that contains a good <i>but not necessarily perfect</i> mix of all visible wavelengths.<p>When you decrease the color temperature of an image, you are <i>reducing</i> the amount of short wavelength light, <i>not</i> eliminating it.  LCD imperfection is frankly irrelevant as some short wavelength light is still coming through <i>by design</i>.  If you removed <i>all</i> short wavelength light you would just be left with reds and blacks.  That isn&#x27;t what f.lux does, or claims to do.<p>> <i>&quot;So the question becomes, is that leaked white light enough to disrupt your sleep? No one&#x27;s done any studies on this question&quot;</i><p>Many studies have been done on the effects of different intensities of short wavelength light on sleep.  This research isn&#x27;t binary <i>&quot;blue light or zero blue light&quot;</i>  For example, any of the studies which include an incandescent bulb cover this.  Incandescent bulbs are black body radiators, they emit short wavelength light and long wavelength light, however the proportion of short to long wavelength light that they emit is much different from what florescent bulbs emit. (Specifically, light from incandescent bulbs is said to be &quot;warmer&quot;).<p>By the way, one of polyfractal&#x27;s links is to a study that used <i>LCDs</i> as the light source.

6562829,comment,6560085,6560504,2,0,strlen,,,">> Where I grew up, the required high school curriculum includes a lot about ancient civilizations, creative writing, chemistry and physics, and algebra. It didn&#x27;t teach how to write a persuasive proposal in a business context, string together a logically-sound argument, or form inferences from empirical data, and taught very little about contemporary politics or recent American or world history. It didn&#x27;t teach how to mediate an interpersonal conflict at work, delegate a task, or effectively communicate an idea in a presentation.<p>I&#x27;ve nearly had the same experience as you but my perception of it was very different. I attended one of the top 100 high-schools in the US and one of the top non-magnet public schools in my state. My curriculum was comprehensive, but yes -- prima facie, very little of it was seemed applicable (other than intro to business -- which helped me deal with personal finances, maths -- which helped me write &quot;demo&quot; programs, and of course CS classes).<p>On the other hand, I enjoyed&quot;knowledge for the sake of knowledge&quot; tremendously (e.g., History courses) but most importantly -- I felt that I learned a great deal <i>between the lines</i> in those classes. I wrote a great deal of persuasive essays in humanities courses, I begin to see American politics beyond simple slogans, and I read books that taught me a great deal about the human condition that I may have missed out in my suburb (All Quiet On The Western Front comes to mind) and even when they didn&#x27;t -- they taught me to be a better conservationist at lunch time.<p>I&#x27;ll note, however, that high school could have done a great deal more. I came to the US in the middle of 7th grade from former USSR and stepping into a US middle-school felt like a horrible practical joke: instead of chemistry and physics, for examples, there was one class called &quot;science&quot;, and the quadratic formula would not be covered for another year.<p>I suspect, however, we&#x27;ve a different personality -- many of my classmates echo your views on this matter, equally as many echo yours. There was a similar split in college: equally as many greatly enjoyed general education/core requirements, others saw it as a hindrance to taking my engineering courses. On a micro-level it happened within the discipline as well and to an extent I was guilty of this: I wanted to crank out of code and not do integration by parts by hand, so I went through the &quot;motions&quot; rather than learn this by heart, which I came to regret years later when I tried to grok the kernel trick in machine learning.<p>I am, however, inclined to agree with you: we <i>should</i> teach the fundamental concepts directly, but not at the exclusion of general knowledge. Some students are motivated by practical applications, others more so by knowledge itself -- and this may varies by discipline. Given a college-level education is effectively necessity (even if a paper saying &quot;B.S. in CS&quot; is not always a hard requirement, the requisite proficiency is still expected) students who are not as intrinsically motivated to learn the material use self-discipline to compensate. This is not good news, as it reinforces the popular perception of education as &quot;boring&quot; by necessity and attractive only to people who like being bored.",1381967769

This is why people all across America felt the pain of the 9/11 attacks despite the fact that realistically the vast majority of us did not have family members or friends that died in the attack.<p>At a fundamental level this patriotic bond alone seems to make the majority of governments considerably more altruistic toward their citizens than a company would be towards their customers.<p>After all the leaders of government are also citizens with that bond of shared country and patriotism that they share with other citizens.

I admit though I didn&#x27;t read the article beyond the first page - and your quote, of course - as, frankly, it contained too much wrong from the start that I didn&#x27;t want to waste any more of my time on it. Reading Ignatiev&#x27;s profile, he certainly looks like a person way out of the mainstream and with good deal of cookiness in him, so I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;s a good example of a mainstream academic or writer.<p>I think also there is confusing equality of possibilities with equality of outcomes. The outcomes are demonstrably unequal. But is this because medical industry or welfare system are racial? From what I see, some systems are now geared to give unfair advantage to minority players willing to game the system (google &quot;Pigford settlement&quot;). However, as I said, the overall outcomes are still very unequal. I think there are institutional causes for it, but I think the causes are not racial now (though historically they were) but viewing it through exclusively racial lens today only makes it worse, as it makes people take wrong decisions (i.e. vote for corrupt and incompetent, but racially suitable politician, instead of honest and competent one of a wrong race). Same with regard to war on drugs - if we decide it&#x27;s about racism, we should then spend our efforts on ensuring persons of all races are equally punished for equal crimes.

If there&#x27;s any overlapping sections from having to rewalk the a curve, maybe apply some offsets/small modifications to those curves to give it a &quot;sketched&quot; look.<p>-Rasterize the bezier curves in order at your desired resolution into a list of XY coordinates. Make sure the XY coordinates remain in order they were rasterized.<p>-Split the coordinates of each rasterized pixel so that you have two lists, (t, x) and (t, y), where t is the index of the rasterized pixel. Now you can represent  the X and Y coordinates of your sketch on two coordinate planes as a function of t.<p>-For each coordinate plane X and Y, record the index where the second derivative of the rasterized graph changes. What this does is lets you distinguish subcurves on the line. For this to work it&#x27;s probably important that the rasterization was done at a relatively high resolution.<p>-For each subcurve, generate an extremely low frequency trigonometric function that can represent that subcurve. Ideally outside of that subcurve, the trig function should be at or very near zero. This might require layering some additional trig functions in order to eliminate any noise.<p>-With the trig functions generated, return the results as a parametric function.",1381967484

Whereas you&#x27;re going to see much higher numbers for East Coast schools that are near these hackathons.<p>On the flip side, since I&#x27;m at Berkeley, I can just take a 30 min.

I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a useful metric at all, except to say, &quot;Well, this language isn&#x27;t quite so horribly stunted that you can&#x27;t even produce a nonterminating program.&quot;<p>If you want to talk about how <i>easy</i> it is to build needless complexity— well, I&#x27;ve yet to see a programming language that knows the difference between necessary complexity and needless complexity well enough to allow the former and prevent the latter. Rather, languages either let you build complex things easily, whether you need that complexity or not, or they just make it a right pain in the ass to accomplish <i>anything</i>.<p>Personally, I prefer the languages that let me express the complexity of my problem domain easily; sure, I could use them to make things more complex than they need to be, but I don&#x27;t, because to be quite frank that&#x27;s just part of being a competent programmer.",1425592748

But whatever you do to create the data structure that gets passed to React is up to you. This keeps most of your domain logic outside the context of React, you just use React to render data->DOM. So basically the API you have to learn is just Javascript, which most people know already and is easy to lookup answers to your questions.<p>With Angular your domain logic exists in the context of the framework. i.e. if you ng-repeat something you can&#x27;t just filter that collection with Javascript you have to use an ng-filter to do it which is a special Angular construct. So the API you have to learn to manipulate data isn&#x27;t just Javascript it&#x27;s Angular. And how does ng-filter work? Well, you&#x27;re tied to the Angular docs to figure it out. The Angular docs are of particualary poor quality so this coupling turns into a really serious problem if you&#x27;re trying to be productive.<p>To me React vs. Angular isn&#x27;t a matter of preference like Ruby vs. Python -- it&#x27;s more like git vs. FTP where there is a clear right answer if you&#x27;re trying to be productive in a team envrionment.",1425592582

Not in any fortune 50 or whatevr company with compliance and security infrastructure. This is something that has changed drastically in the past 10 years.&quot;<p>Yes ... towards things like Google Mail for Corporations.  If you make your corporate email better than your personal email, people will use it.  If not, they just won&#x27;t, if they have enough political power within the organization.<p>I speak from close exposure to white glove CxO level IT service where we do everything from ensure the biometric reader on the CEO&#x27;s laptop works, to helping wire the CFO&#x27;s home theatre system, getting the board chairman&#x27;s vacation photos printed,  and setting up all their personal devices.<p>If these sorts of folks don&#x27;t like a system, they won&#x27;t use it. They chucked the Blackberry for an iPhone.  One of the reasons I&#x27;ve seen biometrics on a laptop is that a particular leader refused to remember a password longer than 4 digits.  That alone made them prefer the corporate Lenovo vs. their personal Macbook Air.<p>&quot;Most corporate hardware should be presumed &quot;insecure&quot; from the perspective of personal communication, and similarly so shoud any account that is used to co-mingle work and personal communication.&quot;<p>Bring Your Own Device is becoming popular.   Every company I&#x27;ve worked for in the past 8 years (2/3 in the Fortune 100)  allows BYOD in some form for executives, where they mix their personal and corporate communication.   And sometimes for all employees.<p>The latest thinking in corporate security is not to lock down devices but rather to assume that ALL devices are vulnerable, with no special status for corporate assets.  The solution there is to isolate in depth at the service level, with appropriate policy and device management installed for enforcing minimum standards and for emergency remote wipe.  Modern apps - email, HR, reporting, order management, etc. are on the Internet, not behind the firewall... unless there&#x27;s a need for NAT.  Legacy can be accessed through VDI.<p>I admit the future here is not evenly distributed yet.   But this is the trend that I see.<p>&quot;In other words, it is with great risk[1] that you don&#x27;t use company hardware. Unless you have duplicate systems, of course. And if you have a duplicate system that you pay for in lieu of the company, only to for the purpose of subverting company policy, you have an ethics problem.&quot;<p>I would say corporate IT has a usability problem.",1425592557

These may or may not be their actual reasons, those are known only to the individual.<p>Honestly you don&#x27;t deserve any reply though, after the way you treated OP. It is always the person who makes a claim who has to provide evidence for it - it is NOT the person who disagrees with the claim.<p>>Partly because so many of these people seem to think it&#x27;s somebody else&#x27;s job to argue them into an understanding. (Rather than, say, their responsibility to do a Google search and read for a whole hour.)<p>That is exactly what the rules for civilized debate proscribe. You have to argue your case, I don&#x27;t have to.<p>1)Lawyers were (assumed) to be a safe career in 2005, in a world that did have that many safe jobs left. In 1965 there were a lot of other jobs that seemed safe, but didn&#x27;t require you to work as hard to obtain them.<p>2)Lawyers have high earning potential - unlike most other jobs you can get with a college degree today. In 1965, this would have mattered less, because most jobs were relatively high paying (boom time does that).<p>3)In a world that changes rapidly, lawyering seems relatively safe, again the world changed less rapidly in 1965, with fewer obsolete jobs.<p>4)A safe, high paying job gives a high prestige. With fewer such types of jobs, more people will want to join those that exists.<p>So those would explain a higher amount of applicants to law schools, but not necessarily a higher amount of women, right? The thing is that law schools are limited in how many can be accepted and in how many new law schools can be created. You can&#x27;t learn the law on your own in your bedroom and then get a job as a lawyer.<p>Is this what happened? Hell I don&#x27;t know. I do know that it is at least possible it went this way and the explanation is as good as there were a large amount of sexism in law. After all if there were that much sexism in law in 1965, but not in 2005 why would there be so much sexism in computers today?",1425591729

This is far from the case. If you look at the SENS approach to repair therapies [1], treatments when realized will be mass-produced infusions of cells, proteins, and drugs. Everyone will get the same treatments because everyone ages due to the same underlying cellular and molecular damage. You&#x27;ll need one round of treatments every ten to twenty years, and they will be given by a bored clinical assistant. No great attention will be needed by highly trained and expensive medical staff, as all of the complexity will be baked into the manufacturing process. Today&#x27;s closest analogs are the comparatively new mass-produced biologics used to treat autoimmune conditions [2], and even in the wildly dysfunctional US medical system these cost less than ten thousand dollars for a treatment.<p>Rejuvenation won&#x27;t cost millions, or even hundreds of thousands. It will likely cost less than many people spend on overpriced coffee over the course of two decades of life, and should fall far below that level. When the entire population is the marketplace for competing developers, costs will eventually plummet to those seen for decades-old generic drugs and similar items produced in factory settings: just a handful of dollars per dose. The poorest half of the world will gain access at that point, just as today they have access to drugs that were far beyond their reach when initially developed.<p>Nonetheless, many people believe that longevity enhancing therapies will only be available for the wealthy, and that this will be an important dynamic in the future. Inequality is something of a cultural fixation at the moment, and it is manufactured as a fantasy where it doesn&#x27;t exist in reality.

The most obvious fitness function in this context would be that the code works and was written faster than anyone else.  Why talk about best-practice and industry standards if your fitness function is speed of writing and correctness?<p>Experienced programmers don&#x27;t talk about the &quot;best&quot; code in general, but rather the best code for a given purpose. Code clarity, speed of execution, elegance, reuse, size in memory... these are all different fitness objectives that have various trade-offs... even saying &quot;yeah, I want ALL of those!&quot; implies trade-offs.<p>It&#x27;s like saying you want a D&D character with all max attributes... it doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>But there&#x27;s also a problem with this model of learning.  The fastest coders are going to likely be the coders who already know what they are doing, or who work out cheesy ways to game the system.  Likely, their incentive for playing will be showing off, not genuinely helping others learn.<p>Meanwhile, coders who are learning will always be slower.  Yes, they will see a lot of other possible solutions, but without critically understanding the differences between code examples, it all becomes a sea of noise.  Stack Overflow is already like this in places -- many answers don&#x27;t demonstrate an expert analysis of a problem, they simply devolve into: &quot;I tried this&quot;, &quot;I reinstalled&quot;, &quot;Yeah, it works!&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m still having issues&quot;.<p>Now, if bitlean&#x27;s &#x27;tail&#x27; in the game was a nice social community built around commenting and critiquing code AFTER it was written and judging its fitness for various stated purposes -- then I could see that really building a community of value for learning programming similar to the ways that we learn critical reasoning in writing courses by contributing to critique and discussion.<p>&#x27;Fast&#x27; has its purposes.  For example, in Shamus Culhane&#x27;s book &quot;Animation: from Script to Screen&quot;, he talks about the advantages of sketching fast without critical interruption to maintain creative flow.  He was adamant about not even erasing one wrong pencil line because it brought critical analysis into the process and disrupted the flow.

I think it&#x27;s just that most companies don&#x27;t give most young programmers big enough raises to reflect their increased value on the open market.<p>Lots of companies don&#x27;t want to hire new grads, so there&#x27;s a significant price premium for hiring someone with a couple years of experience.  The companies that are willing to hire new grads aren&#x27;t always willing to give annual raises that reflect that price premium.  So lots of programmers with a couple of years of experience see that they can get a 20% raise by switching jobs.  So they switch jobs.<p>(This happens with programmers later in their career too, but the difference between 8 and 10 years of experience is much less dramatic than the difference between 0 and 2.  If a company gives the same annual raise to all its programmers in the same performance band regardless of experience, that raise may be too small for the newest ones, even if it&#x27;s just right for the middle ones.)",1425589725

I don&#x27;t hold many political positions on whose hill I&#x27;m not comfortable dying, so bring it.<p>I think most people agree that morality isn&#x27;t defined by consensus. We&#x27;re not talking about morality in the objective sense, to the extent that such a thing exists. We&#x27;re talking morality <i>as perceived</i> by others and the very real consequences that can flow from remaining consistent in one&#x27;s moral perspective, while the rest of the community&#x27;s view shifts. When that view turns against you, is it really fair to say that you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do your job anymore? You may be OK with economic martyrdom if it comes down to it, but it&#x27;s unlikely you actually <i>want</i> that to disrupt your life.<p>You&#x27;re acting as if there is an objective test that proves your perspective is moral by definition. No such thing exists. That&#x27;s why people disagree on these issues and it&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important that we maintain decorum and civility while disagreeing -- good, moral people can have differing opinions. Very few people are truly evil.<p>It&#x27;s extremely unlikely that Brendan Eich would argue gay people are &quot;not human beings&quot;, or even that they are &quot;lesser human beings&quot;. That is not the premise of Prop 8. The fact that you can&#x27;t see it any other way just shows how effective gay rights advocates have been at radicalizing a substantial portion of the population.<p>Homosexuality is a behavior. Gay marriage is the question of whether the government should subsidize or sponsor that behavior in the same way it subsidizes and sponsors heterosexual behaviors. These aren&#x27;t questions of identities, they&#x27;re questions of practicalities. People can disagree on them and still be good people.<p>You understand that only a few short decades ago, <i>your</i> position would&#x27;ve been the one that got people fired, right? It&#x27;s cool that you think it&#x27;s objectively right, and it&#x27;s your prerogative to believe that. But you should acknowledge that differing viewpoints on these matters should be tolerated as a valid form of free political discourse. Free speech means we tolerate the contributions of our fellow citizens, even if we strongly disagree. I would suggest that depriving fellow citizens of income they&#x27;re currently receiving specifically because they disagree on a political issue, whether it&#x27;s gay marriage or the humor in dongle jokes, is not respectful of the basic freedoms that allow a democratic society to function.<p>This conversation is <i>great</i> supporting evidence for the argument for anonymity when discussing any significant controversial issue. PG&#x27;s essay &quot;What You Can&#x27;t Say&quot; addresses this also; unless your life&#x27;s goal is to rehabilitate the particular social taboos of your time (that is, unless martyrdom is your goal), it&#x27;s probably best not to get directly associated with that rehabilitation effort.",1425589464

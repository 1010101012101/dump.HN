You're insulated from whatever invariably boring domain your company happens to serve, you have far more range to innovate and try new technologies, you don't have to deal with customers who aren't also developers...<p>A disproportionate amount of interesting projects I've read about and seen were internal tools of various sorts: compilers, static analysis, testing, verification, building. If I was going to work at a big company like Google or Facebook, I would definitely prefer to be on a tools team.<p>Also, I think working at a financial company like Jane Street would be great, and that is also an internal sort of job. Really, the company doesn't have any external customers at all. Yet I'd go there over virtually any other standard software engineering sort of job.",1358996394

5106875,comment,5105928,5106594,1,0,legutierr,,,"It's very frustrating reading the analogies that you are attempting to use to describe the charges in this case.<p>Is what weev did the same as walking to your ex-wife's house with a chainsaw while you shout that you're going to murder her (God forbid)?  No, of course not.  Given the actual harm or potential harm incurred here, weev's crime was more like walking to your ex-wife's house with an oversized down pillow while you talk about giving her a spanking on the bottom with it.<p>Is what weev did the same thing as walking into a stranger's house through his unlocked front door and then rifling through his personal papers?  I don't think so.  It would be better to say it is the same thing as walking past a house after the owner has plastered it with old credit card statements and then remarking to a fellow passer-by that you might make some expensive purchases using that now-public information.<p>The problem with the charges filed against weev and the charges filed against aaronsw is that they were based on a law that so lacks specificity and grounding in actual computer practice that even computer professionals need to use analogies to justify the illegality of the acts.  If the law were legitimate such analogies would not be required.<p>Is it fair to convict a person based on an analogy, when another analogy might be more correct?  If an appropriate analogy is required to determine guilt, then does the analogy itself take on the weight of law, and if so, who is to determine the correct analogy to apply in such a case (when the choice of appropriate analogy is what determines guilt or innocence), the judge, or the jury?  No, if an action is going to be criminal, it must be possible to describe that action itself in its own literal terms and thereby determine its criminality.<p>You write that ""crime = intent + action"", and then you talk about nothing but his intent.  The fact is that the <i>action</i> he undertook can only be described as criminal insofar as accessing a public URL that is not otherwise publicized qualifies as ""exceeding access"", which is what the CFAA makes a crime.<p>This is the problem with your argument, with the cases against both weev and aaronsw, and with the CFAA itself.  Whatever ill will may have existed in weev's mind (I'm sure there is plenty there to go around), for his <i>action</i> iteself to be criminal, weev had to know what was in the mind of AT&T.  And how could he?  Because ""authorization"" is not a concept in the http protocol (or maybe there is, if you count http authentication, which wasn't used here) there are no methods besides clairvoyancy or pure gussing to determine whether a public URL is intended for open access or not.  We <i>have to</i> assume that a public URL automatically grants authorization.<p>This is why the case against weev is so distressing.  Although his <i>intent</i> may have been questionable, the actual <i>action</i> that is being prosecuted in this case is nothing more than fiddling with a url in a web browser.  Who hasn't done this when looking through an image site like imgur.com or similar, just to see what's there randomly?  We do this because it is universally accepted that unless a password restriction has been placed on a url, any publicly-accessible URL is intended to be viewed by the general public.  Assuming anything else would break the Internet.",1358996359

If maven doesn't do what you need to do, then chances are you don't need to do it. You may think you need to do it, you probably don't. Maybe what you need is a more powerful deployment system, or something that takes over after your java/scala/whatever is built.<p>If you're building perl, C, C++, sure, maven isn't going to do it for you. If you're building java, you're sorted.<p>My favorite is when this sequence happens (I have seen it first hand):<p><pre><code>  1. Maven is this external system that we have no control over.
  2. We will write our own system that will be awesome.

I'm sure you can fuck that up just as well using Ruby. Go for it.<p>I work in a java shop currently. There's got to be a hundred of us. Every single one uses an IDE.<p>When I use maven, my IDE just works. eclipse, intellij, netbeans all support maven. Want to put a bunch of files in a common war to share? maven has a merge-war plugin and intellij and eclipse know what it means: they both build projects that copy the files just like maven would do. Better yet, as you edit those files, no matter where they are, both eclipse and intellij update the files in the deploy target and they are available when you refresh your browser. There is a huge amount of investment in making this stuff work. This is convention over configuration.<p>No tool can do this with Ant (or Ruby) unless it <i>runs</i> the Ant and the Ruby, and then you've side stepped the IDE and reduced them to dumb text editors. With an Ant project, the IDE can't know that when I edit file A, it is transmogrified into file Z. (If it could, it could solve the halting problem). With Maven, the IDE implements <i>convention</i>, and so it know that File A is compiled to File B and then must be copied to location Z because its part of a merged war. Add JRebel to the equation and pretty much any change to the code is immediately runnable. Its dangerously easy to spike away instead of writing tests!",1358996016

What is the law that's broken?<p>You're oversimplifying the situation. See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Penal_Code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Penal_Code</a>.<p>As I said, crime = intent + action. If you kill someone, and you had no bad intent (it was neither your purpose to kill them nor were you acting negligently), then there is no crime. At the same time, if you fully intend to kill someone, but don't take any action consistent with that intent, there is no crime. The two factors must also exist simultaneously. If you intend to kill someone, and buy a gun, you can be charged with attempted murder. If you fully intend to kill someone today, but then change your mind, and tomorrow buy a gun because of a rash of burglaries tomorrow, then there is no crime.<p>Now, obviously we can't get inside someone's head. So we infer intent from action. But we must always remember that the focus is not the action, but what the action says as evidence of the person's intent. And no matter what intent is inferred, there must still be independent action towards committing the crime.<p>So no, it's not illegal to say ""I might do this."" But, saying ""I might do this"" can amount to evidence that you intend, in fact, to do this, and if you independently take some other action consistent with this intent, you can be charged with an attempted crime.",1358993548

(The wikipedia page on ILS describes how it works, so I won't repeat it here.)  AMing the right carrier with 150 and 90 Hz tones (which really means generating carrier + and - 150 Hz and carrier + and - 90 Hz) would cause the localizer to show the plane centered on the glide path, even if it isn't.",1358993396

Namecheap has a decent website with an intuitive interface for managing domains, pretty good knowledgebase and forum, and nice features like email alerts for account activity. GoDaddy lost me as a customer because of their unreadable emails and deliberately unintuitive web interface. Namecheap is a refreshing change. I only use them as a registrar, since I handle my own DNS and email. I've dealt with around 10 different registrars over the years and like Namecheap the most, so far.",1358993335

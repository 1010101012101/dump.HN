The ten-minute format fosters a succinct Q&A and to date my sessions have been quite productive. It&#x27;s yet to feel like a waste of time, especially because I&#x27;ve set aside the time to participate. Since there&#x27;s inherent value in providing advice (as well as receiving it), charging for the conversation hasn&#x27;t even crossed my mind. I think the broad spectrum of advisors (from well-known names to newcomers) helps to encourage interaction; users who are intimidated by titles can get their feet wet with an advisor by checking their knowledge stats alone.

Most everything there is marked up to a very limited extent, no more than about 15%. It&#x27;s a much lower markup than found in typical retail stores. Costco&#x27;s profit actually comes mostly from the yearly membership fees, not from the markup on individual items.<p>The low markup means you need <i>different</i> heuristics rather than price.<p>E.g. mayonnaise. Costco stocks Hellman&#x27;s (or I think it&#x27;s Best Foods out west) brand. But they only stock the gallon size (or some large size, I don&#x27;t do the mayo buying in our house). So what they&#x27;re telling you is: &quot;we&#x27;re giving you a very competitive price on this brand of mayonnaise, <i>provided that</i> you need a gallon of it.&quot; So your heuristic should not be &quot;is this a good price?&quot; but rather &quot;can I use 1 gallon of mayo before I get sick of looking at that jar in the fridge?&quot;.<p>I use mayo as an example because many years ago a co-worker was telling us the story of how she went to Costco and bought a gallon and then when she went home found that her husband also went there and bought a gallon. So now she had two gallons in the fridge, and that&#x27;s a lot of mayo for someone without children!<p>I use Costco primarily for things that are expensive or difficult to find elsewhere.<p>For an example of expensive, the transcript mentions Ziploc bags. I buy those at Costco because at the normal supermarkets around me they cost about 2x or 3x as much. Yes the price difference is that large, and we use a lot of them.<p>For an example of difficult to find, Costco stocks a product called &quot;Talking Rain&quot;. This is just carbonated water in 0.5 liter plastic bottles, with a trace amount of flavoring. No sugar, no artificial sweetener, no calories. IMO they are a great alternative to drinking plain bottled water on car trips, etc. But this product is hard to find in normal supermarkets. Costco sells it in cases of 30 bottles or so, for about $10.",1443336749

The libraries seem written to remove coding drudgery.  When I look at Go, I see Java.  The language and libraries require a lot of boilerplate to do simple things, e.g., parse a JSON file or a simple HTTP GET. Some of this is due to static typing, but it&#x27;s still overly complex.  Maybe the 3rd party Go libraries will evolve given enough time.<p>As a language, Go just seems like a step backward from Ruby or Python. I categorize it as a language for people who like to write code for code&#x27;s sake. It does seem like a better Java or C.<p>I do love gofmt, and obviously the speed, but the killer features are built in cross compilation and the simplicity of deploying a Go app with Docker.

This was done so the afternoon pundits could make wild claims (the propaganda) that blatantly misrepresents the story, by drawing self-serving inferences from the earlier story. This was disguised by claiming &quot;Sources say ...&quot;, conveniently leaving out that <i>the same people</i> often were those &quot;sources&quot;.

Arvo is not enough like anything else to be seen as anything else but research.<p>This is a fairly typical timeline for CS research.  What&#x27;s unusual is just the depth of the stack.  I would also point out that if you look at the normal cost of developing any sort of operating system, even to the alpha level, the metrics are pretty good.<p>Where the project looks really unproductive is in objective measures of content production.

Reading the description, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as serious as the author of this post is making it out to be. But there&#x27;s no information about how fast the client will step up the transmit rate after a period of quiescence and no data from traffic analysis to determine how frequently real-world servers encounter this condition and the overall effect in terms of dropped packets, increased queue depths, and latency spikes.<p>(Google are actually in a good position to provide these data; a number of Google&#x27;s own services will doubtless benefit. I suspect the scale of Google&#x27;s operations means that even a barely-measurable decrease in latency or queue depth compounds to a big gain pretty quickly.)",1443334245

The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially this was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse.",1443333615

One of the defining moments in US history is when George Washington chose to resign his post as general of the continental army rather than use it to crown himself emperor.<p>The big question is would it have worked? Was the fledgling country so republic-loving that it would have overcame a despotic Washington?<p>In other words, how robust is freedom when the general populace really wants it (and has somewhat of the means to back it up)?",1347087557

It is cool to hate Facebook on HN now, because they make a lot of money and the audience here is predominately trying to bootstrap a startup but that doesn't change the fact that one of the most popular and largest sites on the Internet has an issue which was developed most likely by a few engineers.<p>These amateur hour type comments which seem to always follow Facebook posts anymore seem to say more about the fact that more and more HN commenters have no experience working in an enterprise environment and believe their 10 instance AWS based startup they are currently involved with somehow is comparable to the Facebook ecosystem.",1347084438

That deadline passed, and the contract became null.  The FSP is dead, according to its own bylaws.  What continues to this day is a fraud.  Of course, since that deadline was almost a decade ago, and the people running the FSP took down all the info from the website, and have been pretending otherwise, most people have never heard any of this.",1347084319

She was hired to turn around a company in crisis, there were major problems, and she based her decision on data (seeing that many people who were supposed to work via VPN weren't even logging in according to their VPN records).<p>It was clearly a unique decision for a unique situation and not a comment on telecommuting in general, despite what all the screamers were screaming.  Judging from various comments from alleged insiders, it was a good decision because many of the telecommuters were just loafers.<p>Fact is, who cares what the screamers were screaming?  Would people boycott Yahoo's products because they ended telecommuting?  This so cannot be compared to buying products made in sweatshops, which many people clearly did for years anyway (and still do).  Would employees stop wanting to work at Yahoo?  Apparently, job applications are way up, including what industry considers top tier candidates.<p>When you make the right decision, sometimes the best option is to stay quiet and let the truth come out naturally.  Of course, OP is more about the strategy in general, not whether or not the truth comes out naturally (in fact, in OP, they cared not for truth).  I'm just saying I felt throughout the whole Yahoo telecommuting thing, Mayer did the right thing.  Screw the screamers.

I've never encountered it before, nor do I know anyone that would use this definition.<p>Do you mean the idea that science must craft and then test theories? That's not at all controversial, and every legitimate science is defined by its theories. Without the Standard Model, physics isn't science.  Without the theories of evolution, genetics and cell biology, biology is not science. Without theories about geological processes and plate tectonics, geology is not science.<p>How could we determine whether a field is or is not a science unless the determination was based on its tested, defining theories? We know astrology is not a science because its theories fail when tested. Are you saying that astrology would become a science by <i>not</i> having testable theories?<p>> When people operating on a different definition of science encounter your definition ...<p>Not only is this not my definition, it has been expressed in a number of legal decisions that, for example, keep Creationism out of public school classrooms. The reason? Creationism's theories fail when tested.<p>>> In fact, science is ten studies making one claim.<p>> If it is a fact, can you provide a source for this definition?<p>My source is the practice of science. Einstein's relativity theory, as pretty as it was on paper, was not accepted until the corpus of evidence for it was overwhelming, in dozens of confirmations (this required experimental work until the mid-1960s). Plate tectonics was not accepted until the field evidence became overwhelming. Examples abound. All on need do is read some science history to discover that one publication means nothing.<p>> These are the things that one will naturally wonder about in the context of contempt, even if the contempt is accidental.<p>Science doesn't care about contempt, it cares about evidence. Contempt is completely irrelevant to the process, and every scientist knows this.",1366708316

5594038,comment,5591133,5593405,14,0,sgift,,,"This reminds of a story I've read about (big) companies and electricity: At the start of the 20th century it was typical for companies to produce their own electricity. The concerns where basically the same as they are now with Internet services: Your business depends on another company; what will you do if they close down? Or throw you out? And what about the transmission - I've heard the net is not stable? and so on. So, what did change? Trust. Electric companies invested heavily in various areas:<p><pre><code>  - Reliability. The electric transmission net was shit at this time. Blackouts each week, sometimes each day were typical\n  - Cross-transmission i.e. a shared transmission net instead of one net per provider, so you could switch without much hassle if your provider failed you\n  - Better contracts to guarantee that you will get your electricity and that a company cannot dump you without notice\n</code></pre>\nAll of this parts worked together to convince companies that electricity was no longer something you had to do yourself, but something that could be provided by someone else.\nAs far as I can tell Google tries to be the outsourcing address for various (all?) net related services which have been done ""in house"" in the past. The problem seems to be that they fail in the areas highlighted above. As long as this doesn't change many companies will be hesitant to trust Google with services they depend on. And maybe posts like the OPs (and robomartins) show that they are correct in their assessment.",1366707761

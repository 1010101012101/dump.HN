72675,comment,72606,72628,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Languages become popular when they gain a critical mass of developers. They can get this critical mass of developers for more than one reason. Marketing, running fast on cheap hardware, etc. can all be things that can single handedly make a language popular. <p>A lot of languages however have become popular due to large PR budgets (Java and the .NET family). <p>XML became popular because it addressed the need to have a self-documenting data inter-change format so that governments and companies can be reassured that even if a vendor goes out of business they can reuse the data (similar reasons for the push behind ODF).<p>Lisp hasn't yet addressed the needs of the masses (develop X blog in 15 minutes with a human readable syntax), or be pushed into the enterprise by large companies, or have a large pool of qualified developers, so it hasn't become popular. <p>Personally I don't think it ever will become a mainstream language. It requires a different way of thinking that I'm not sure a lot of folks can grasp. Ruby might be as close to Lisp as a lot of folks are willing to get.",1193347384

In essence, you'd be gambling that your pick is the right pick. Frankly, if you really think you can do that; you ought to be buying stocks and not picking languages.<p>Instead, what you should be doing is learning how to be an excellent technology generalist. Get a solid foundation in the ""Basics"" of the web. Learn a scripting language that runs on the server, learn javascript, learn CSS & HTML. The most important thing is to figure out how you pick up new languages, because if you work on the web, you're going to be doing a LOT of picking up new languages and technologies. <p>Not putting your eggs in one basket is a very apt analogy to how to best prepare for a career on the web.

72663,comment,71967,72452,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I agree. Python certainly has its quirks. But what I like about it is that it doesn't force OO or functional styles. You can ""ease"" into them. I like writing non OO python. \nAlso with the significant whitespace, its great for teaching as it makes the code clear without syntactic noise. <p>the only thing I find confusing is forgetting that there may be a global function to do what I want. eg len(array) as opposed to list.length (ruby). But that probably doesn't hurt in reality at all. <p>The few books I have read on python are also excellent and approachable. <p>Also you can do fun stuff with python (build GUIs etc) and do tangible stuff that makes teaching it more fun.

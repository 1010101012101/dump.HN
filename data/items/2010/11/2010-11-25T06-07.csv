I'm only coding for iOS devices but my understanding is that for OSX, there is a stable GC system. On iOS, you manage the memory yourself.

If you have to extend mail servers to support discoverable multicast endpoints, at that point you might as well just make a new protocol from scratch.<p>Another big problem with push, besides the overhead, is that everything is transient.

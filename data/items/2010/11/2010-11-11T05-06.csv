If you have ever taken a stance on the wellbeing of people other than yourself, particularly a political stance, or if you have ever defended a friend or family member against an accuser, or any number of other normal human social interactions, then you do understand what it feels like, although perhaps to a different degree than me in this case.<p>And, I also have to point out that whether you understand why I argue about this has precisely nothing to do with the validity of my arguments.<p>> It's entirely reasonable to point out that women may respond differently to visual depictions of nudity<p>Only if it's backed up by evidence and relevant. It is neither in this case. Observing that women are less hairy is a fact, provable, and does not play a role in the argument at hand. Observing that women react differently to nudity than men is wrong on two fronts. First, it may not even be true. Second, in the context of a woman making a political statement about the depiction of her gender, it is a rhetorical device based on a premise of unknown veracity whose primary purpose is to discredit her beliefs to a male audience. It's a variant of ""women are irrational, so we don't need to listen to them,"" albeit less transparently foolish.",1289454429

I know if it happened I would be hitching to the Apache trial as opposed to the Oracle one, if they diverge I would feel more comfortable on the Apache side.

The quantity and quality of research on Success for
All, and the positive outcomes found in almost all
studies by more than fi fty investigators in eighteen
different research institutions worldwide, clearly
establish that Success for All is highly effective in
increasing student reading. The effects can be quite
substantial, averaging more than half of the national
white-minority achievement gap and almost a full
grade equivalent by second grade (see Slavin et al.,
2006). In a time when educators are increasingly
being asked to use proven programs, Success for All
is the best demonstration in existence of the idea
that rigorous research on practical programs can
be done and can show substantial positive effects.

Iâ€™m getting sub-one second app launch times, page load is much faster than safari, page render is comparable.<p>The app is still a bit of a bad citizen in that it doesnâ€™t have any of the native text views allowing for system spell-check or any of the system services, and the appâ€™s cpu usage still runs at 4% with no windows open (expected behavior is that windowless apps use 0)<p>And to be pedantic, thereâ€™s something still Java-y about the interface. Fonts are just a <i>little</i> bit bigger in places, and the main bar, despite being 7px smaller than safariâ€™s (amazing feat, firefox devâ€™s) still feels chunkier.<p>Weird things in the interface vein: The feedback buttonâ€™s dropdown hangs left <i>automatically.</i> Proper system behavior is to drop it down to the right, and then push it left based on the monitorâ€™s viewport. The textfield resize grab changes the mouse cursor.<p>Weird stuff like that. Since itâ€™s a beta I can understand the rough edges strapped to the oversized V12 engine.

However, he never implied that it was the cause of it. I think that would've been the equivalent of career suicide.<p>What I'd like to know more about is the link between texting, social media and the other factors presented that didn't have clear cut explanations. People who are generally more social are bound to be more promiscuous etc. but why was there a link between texting and socioeconomic status, and why was the trend reversed for social networking compared to texting? Also why was there increased rates of obesity for this same group? Aren't larger people usually less social? It's not as simple a study as it seems.",1289451964

Are you prepared for the fact that most (online) gambling establishments don't like automation, and are prepared to go to significant lengths to stop it?

All browers nowadays pretty much look the same, have the same performance and try desperately to distinguish themselves with surrounding features.<p>The basic problem is that the browser is still ""trapped in a sandbox"", ie they're trying to become the OS but they're still just an application running in a limited context. If all browsers looks the same and  perform the same it's going to be real difficult to differentiate yourself from
the competion.<p>It makes sense from big guys point of view. Apple, Microsoft and Google must be present in the browser space to be competitive, especially google whose strategive agenda involves moving application from the OS to the web. For Firefox and Opera things look a bit more bleak IMO.<p>I think browsers will be commoditized to the degree it will be very difficult to compete, it will all come down to brand awareness and surrounding features.<p>My hunch is that Firefox and Opera is dying a slow death and will be irrelevant within 3 years.",1289451749

Simplifying, some of that is in the air, and one beat (or so) is in the hand, so the flight time is one less than the number shown.  That would mean that a ""5"" is in the air for four beats, and thus will go 4 times higher than a ""3"", which is in the air for two beats, or half the time.<p>The truth is more complicated, because your hands aren't full for half the time (which is the one beat assumption above), and the dwell time (percentage time your hand is full) actually varies (although is usually around 65% to 70%).<p>For the numbers to be used it's the beat time that matters, and you can throw higher by slowing the beat, but that still leaves a ""3"" as a ""3"" and that doesn't convert it into a ""4"".<p>All these details are covered in the gentle introduction, but this specific question is dealt with in even more detail in the ""Technical Notes"" section:<p><a href=""http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/SiteSwap.html#technotes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/SiteSwap.html#technotes</a>",1356022051

Both the plain text and the early interpretations of the Commerce Power (Gibbons v.

What is different is that in 1789, most people lived on farms, grew their own food, made their own clothes, etc. Very little human activity came within the scope of the commerce power, as broad as that power was defined.

This is incredibly helpful for working with the API in something like Backbone.js, because then there's no need for logic in determining if it is getting a list of IDs as strings or full objects. It's doubly helpful if the references are to objects of different types. The client simply loads the objects as given, and can do a sync if it's missing attributes it expects. (Of course, sending the full data in one request is usually preferable.) Also, the `url` property on the model just returns the `url` attribute instead of needing to duplicate the URL construction pattern.<p>So,<p><pre><code>    \n    {\n        'id': 123,\n        'url': '/resource/123'\n    },\n    \n</code></pre>\ninstead of<p><pre><code>    \n    '/resource/123',\n    '/resource/124',\n    \n</code></pre>\nor worse<p><pre><code>    \n    123,\n    124,\n    \n</code></pre>\nAlso, Django REST Framework is easily my favorite REST API tool for Django.

Right now you are busy, you could be in a business meeting or perhaps in a class. You receive a text message, read it, and make a mental note to respond later. Several hours go by and the inevitable happens, you forget. This could be benign, like the girlfriend or boyfriend that texts you a lot, or it could be a client.<p>So re:me seeks to solve this problem. re:me builds a list of messages that you have not responded to yet. It works with your native text messaging application, so that you don't have to change your habits. As you respond to people, the messages get cleared from your re:me list. By shifting the focus away from whether a message has been read or not, and putting the focus on what you need to do next, re:me will help make sure that your most important people are never forgotten again.<p>Right now re:me works with only SMS on the Android platform and we are the only SMS management tool in the Google Play store. However, moving forward, re:me will integrate email, social network mailboxes and phone call tracking. With this, it won't be just a casual program, but rather, a message handling platform for professionals whose livelihood depends on managing their communications, people such as consultants and independent contractors.<p>I'm very much interested in hearing feedback from you guys.<p>Yevgeny Chertov",1356021061

If you read the 10th amendment as saying ""Congress shall not infringe on the traditional functions of the states to safeguard health, welfare, and morality"" then you might say that the individual mandate violates the 10th amendment because healthcare is a traditionally state function. But that's not what the 10th amendment says. All it says is that action which falls outside the Constitutional delegates is unconstitutional. Well if the individual mandate is within the Taxing power, then it is within one of the Constitutional delegations, and is by definition outside the scope of the 10th amendment.<p>Basically, federal action can never violate the 10th amendment. Either an exercise of federal power is Constitutional under one of the delegations, or it is not supported by any delegation of federal power and is thus unconstitional for that reason.<p>Re: the expansion of federal power, it's popular but not necessarily accurate to say it has come at the expense of the Constitution. If you had asked the Framers whether a sale of a product in New York, manufactured and shipped from New Jersey, using a bank transaction with a bank and a payment processor located in San Francisco should fall under the purview of the Commerce Power, they probably would have said ""yes, that's interstate commerce."" Yet, that's what happens when I go downstairs and buy a Snickers bar at the vending machine with my credit card. There is disagreement on this subject, but in my opinion the expansion of federal power hasn't come at the expense of the Constitution, but has come because much more human activity has come within the scope of federal power as it was already defined.",1356020640

While we do get the occasion lunatic who goes on a rampage with a rifle (like the recent tragedy in Connecticut, although even he carried handguns), what is more common is gang violence, and gangs prefer guns they can conceal easily:  handguns.

4948323,comment,4947749,4947749,1,0,strangestchild,,,"Presumably it rather depends on what you're storing such large numbers for. If you want to store a single number n (for the sake of argument, let's say a positive integer) for later reference, and have no knowledge in advance of any special properties of the number, you can't do better than ceil(log_2(n)) bits of information, whatever scheme you use for storing it.<p>On the other hand, if you know your number has particular properties (for example, say you knew it was an even number between 10,000 and 1,000,000 digits long) you would be able to use that information to store it more efficiently. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory</a> for the mathematical background for treating this sort of problem.<p>However, many space-efficient ways of storing data are not time-efficient when it comes to retrieving it or performing operations on it. I can refer to huge numbers using very dense mathematical notation - for example, I could mention A(100,100) (see Petrushka's comment on the Ackermann function) - which would allow me to refer to an astronomically huge number in ten characters - but this is useless for most practical purposes as it would take an inordinate amount of time to calculate. Similarly, I could 'store' the quadrillionth prime in memory by simply writing ""the quadrillionth prime"" - but this is probably not what you wanted.<p>The data structure you use will depend enormously on what you want to use it for. For phone numbers, it is helpful to be able to auto-complete numbers a use is typing, which would be difficult to achieve if you simply concatenated them with separators and compressed the data. For storing words in a dictionary, you might use a trie, but that becomes a poor choice of structure if what you actually want is to be able to easily identify words that rhyme with each other.<p>In summary, it is important to identify what sort of numbers you are storing, what operations you intend to be able to support on your dataset, and how you intend to access the elements. In principle, for arbitrary positive integers, you can't do better than the bound I provided - and if you want more than to just store the data without using it, you may end up using rather more than that.",1356019245

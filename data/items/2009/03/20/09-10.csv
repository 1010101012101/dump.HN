Although I wouldn't call him an entrepreneur. It takes a lot of work to build. Although, I really appreciate builders, even if the the idea is not fully thought out.",1237542485

524717,comment,524348,524348,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"As others have pointed out this is a voltage divider.  But what's not been pointed out is that this type of voltage divider is not ideal because the load applied to the output voltage can alter the voltage itself.  It's very important that the load applied draws very little current (i.e. has a high resistance/impedance) otherwise the voltage divider's output voltage changes.<p>The best way around this is to use a voltage divider to produce a reference voltage and feed that into an op-amp that adds the reference voltage to the voltage coming from the device to be measured (in this case the thermistor).<p>As an example of this see my blog posting on building a temperature probe for the OLPC: <a href=""http://www.jgc.org/blog/2008/03/building-temperature-probe-for-olpc-xo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jgc.org/blog/2008/03/building-temperature-probe-f...</a>",1237541756

Shouldn't he get money just once? The publisher pays him a flat fee, and done.<p>The university donation is charity. But I don't see him asking, why do people give to charity.<p>Now change plumber to doctor - the rich support the doctor and the poor give what they can. Sound reasonable? It should - it was the typical model for a good part of history. So why is doctor different from plumber?",1237541447

Adjusting when the queue runs is one option, but you could be unlucky and hit send when there's a small queue that's running in 10 seconds.  I <i>think</i> admins can also force a delay, which is a different operation than spooling it for the normal SMTP process.<p>Outlook/Exchange users can also delay sending (though reneging may take an admin to do): <a href=""http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1638/how_to_delay_sending_message_outlook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1638/how_to_delay_sending_mes...</a> .

524699,comment,524574,524598,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Speaking for ""Journey to the Center of the Earth.""<p>The plot was weakened substantially by the preoccupation with 3d; To the point that watching the 2d version seems goofy. The 3d effect itself was much better than the old days, the color was not distorted because they used polarization and not color shift to create the effect. You still have to wear dumb looking cardboard glasses.<p>Its still not ""real 3d"". Its just a multiplanar effect. Not being able to ""see around"" objects in the depth of field, to me completely ruins the 3d illusion. If you don't hold your head perfectly still, the world seems to come apart in a most distracting way. I couldn't stop thinking of ""Shadow of the Beast"". :)<p>In short, 3D 1) Makes the plots of movies suck. (even more) 2) Creates just enough of an strange planar quasi-3d effect to be distracting. 3) Still requires dorky glasses that make you feel 12.<p>Fine for a 10 minute amusement park attraction, but <i>will not</i> ""save Hollywood"".",1237540654

And not just him - the other people there. He makes it seems like quite a number of people knew stuff, but again, we've heard nothing, except about an offsite accountant.<p>Also he left in 2007, so his info is quite out of date, and his memory probably filled in details that aren't necessarily true.<p>And it just doesn't ring true to me. For example someone obsessed with neatness doesn't just drop that when it's a different part of the business - and saying he doesn't care about that part really doesn't sound true - by all accounts, he cared more about that part then any other - he kept trying to make enough money to get out of the hole.",1237540335

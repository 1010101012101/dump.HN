Jonathon Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" could probably have been used as a litmus test many years ago--nowadays it's just too easy to dismiss it as ""trolling"", or treat it as nothing more than the satire and social commentary it is, rather than having an emotional reaction to it or attempting at least a somewhat serious analysis of whether or not his solution would be feasible in different dimensions and whether or not it would likely help the problem.<p>I like to ask if people operate by (or will operate by having seen the link) Crocker's Rules[0], which tells me whether or not they take responsibility for their own mind.

And that's assuming that it's capable of the same bandwidth capacity per channel; the article states 40Gbps per channel, whereas you can already go as high as 100Gbps over a single wave using DWDM, which means it may only be able to carry 18.5% as much.",1364359368

          $(el).animate({opacity: opacity}, {duration: 100, queue: true});

</code></pre>
(haven't tested this but I think it should work.) In general, I've found that using a queue or queue-like structure can often help alleviate the dreaded ""callback waterfall"". Instead of saying ""do this, then when you're done, do this, then when you're done, do this"", you're saying ""here are a list of the things I want done, do them in order and don't start the next thing in the list before the previous one is done"". If you have some things in the queue that <i>can</i> be run simultaneously, you can combine them with a Deferred (see <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/</a> )<p>In any case, great article - I definitely remember many similar scenarios that came up while I was learning to code.

I've just seen a --in my eyes at least-- seemingly blind pro-government, pro public-sector bend in HN that always seems to float to the surface and I simply don't understand it.  I'm not fighting it at this point because I clearly don't understand it.  I have to understand it first before I can go past that.  Not a molecule in my body thinks this way, so I need help.<p>As far as the distribution of rewards.  The market decides that.  Obviously the market --the average consumer-- does not think government is producing enough value or they would be flush with cash.  If government produced real value we would be throwing money at them, me included.<p>With regards to the question of risky or very, very long term research.<p>Do we really believe government is good at this at all?  I don't really see it that way.  If you compare the evolution of technologies in private hands vs. that of publicly funded programs, what are the results?<p>Perhaps the best comparison is to compare efforts in the old Soviet Union with efforts in similar industries in the US.  For all their might, the Soviets couldn't make a car worth a damn.  During the same period in the US a multitude of private companies produced design after design and evolved solutions that were ages better than anything coming out of the Soviets.<p>Even Igor Sikorsky ultimately had to emigrate to the US in order to have his helicopter designs grow out of private efforts and evolve as they have.  Little known fact: Composer Sergei Rachmaninov funded Sikorsky to the tune of $5,000 to help him launch his company.<p>Now, of course, as any good entrepreneur would do, you look for where you can sell your products.  If government wants to buy you are not going to say ""no"".  And, if government wants to throw more money at you to build other products for them you are going to follow suit.  A lot had to happen before government could shovel money at Sikorsky.  Other similar stories abound.<p>Then there's the question of whether or not government is actually equipped to truly make long reaching decision.  Few decisions are really made with a clear view of what the future outcome might be.  Why did we go to the moon?  It was part of an arms race with the Soviets.  Not much more than that.  Again, war.  I have a very fundamental problem with this idea of doing all of these things and spending all of this money to be better at war-making.  It really stinks.<p>Was the lunar program truly worth the investment?  Could we have produced similar or better results through other programs?<p>I am watching companies like SpaceX with great interest.  The drive, focus and priorities private enterprise has, when combined with people hell-bent to make it happen, cannot be paralleled by any organization assembled by government.  The mindset is massively different.<p>We could point at side benefits of technologies like GPS.  Great stuff, right?  Again, what was the motivator?  Military. War. More efficient killing.  Yuk!  The civilian use of GPS was never a part of the program or the driving motivators.<p>And so, nearly all ""good"" technology that has come out of any government effort is almost always linked to military needs.  If there are no military needs government either does not do it or they fail miserably.<p>This is the aspect of the whole pro-government, pro-public sector, pro-state-funded mentality I am not getting.  You can't point at ARPANET as a state-funded research success without pointing at the thousand or millions (who knows) of people it was surely responsible for helping kill.  One goes with the other.  There is not dividing line.  The state did not initiate these programs to help milk cows or to help us buy books online.  They launched and funded these programs to create better killing systems for the wars they need to conduct.<p>I know I am harping on the military connection.  I am eager to have someone provide me with a list of state-funded technologies that DO NOT have their genesis in a fundamental military need.  I really can't think of one off the top of my head.  Not one.<p>And so, being pro government/public sector/state and singing the praises of all this wonderful technology we should be so thankful for is tantamount to being thankful for, and supporting, all of the military programs and wars that inspire them.  If you elevate what we have received from these government programs and ignore the wars and killing that brought the technologies in to existence you are being a hypocrite.  I sincerely doubt that most of the folks who express pro-state views on HN are war-mongers.<p>And that's when my brain short circuits and I just don't get it.<p>I'd love to understand.",1364358464

that it is an alternative mostly to: ""Trust that a user being able to
read an email address is proof authenticating said user"" -- in other
words sites using it have no expectation that the user need any form of
authentication before being issued a persona (Similar to eg: shared mail
accounts -- where having access to the email does not identify you as a
<i>single</i> person/user -- rather as a group of users -- which is subtly
different).<p>Additionally without any form of single sign out/invalidation of private
keys/session certificates other than expiration (please correct me if
I've missed something wrt sign-out/invalidation) -- persona is in some
ways less secure than ""trust the mailbox"": Even if you change your
password/secret key -- any (stolen) signed session certificate (aka
token/ticket in most other systems) will remain valid as far as the
authorizing site is concerned.<p>This is <i>similar</i> to a stolen cookie -- except the site cannot decide
how long the certificate is valid -- the identity provider does. So if
somedomain.net signs certificates valid for a year, the only thing you
can do as a site allowing persona logins, is mark said domain as ""not
trustworthy enough"" -- and disallow logins.<p>This is ""fine"" as long as Persona isn't used for anything ""serious"" --
however with social engineering attacks, anything that to the end users
appears to be proof of identity can be used to escalate privileges (""He
sent me a hipsterchat-message on kewlchat.net -- so I reset the
RDP-password like he requested"").<p>I do think moving identity management ""closer"" to the user is good --
let the ISP, the various organizations the user is identified with vet
and administer the user database -- but for the general use case -- we
also need some form of trust between the sites, and the iDPs.
Shibboleth[1] is one approach to this -- but it is more complicated that
Persona, and has more overhead.<p>Personally I'd like to see a solution based around x509 certs and 
organizations like <a href=""https://cacert.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cacert.org</a> -- but for that to work we need
browsers to get better at handling cerificates. That is -- we need a
user friendly way to manage identities based around x509 -- and we need
browsers and servers to expect to <i>validate</i> both server and client
certificates. Unfortunately such validation will entail a lot of
problems with expired certs etc... it's not a trivial problem to solve
in practice.<p>[1] <a href=""http://shibboleth.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shibboleth.net/</a>",1364358239

If you want to learn more about how the specific ""tedks"" configuration of neurons works, that's what meditation (a.k.a. self-reflection, self-observation) promises, as opposed to science which by definition cannot do this.  I'm pretty sure that many of the things you consider valuable already do count as meditation (e.g. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5331514"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5331514</a> ), it's just that nobody labelled them as such or built a formal discipline around them.  That might be part of why meditation seems like such BS to you.<p>The stuff about sitting there with your eyes closed and focusing on your breathing isn't really necessary (I don't really do this anymore), all that's meant to do is help you slow your brain down so you can look at it, kind of like using a debugger.  You can get kind of high from that and while fun it can be a hindrance in all sorts of other ways.<p>All the spiritual stuff you see is perhaps best described as a metaphor for the kinds of things people experience, since they don't have better words for it.  Ultimately there isn't a particular belief system tied to meditation, kind of like there isn't a particular belief system tied to the act of debugging a program (although people do like to get into holy wars).<p>Finally, there's this joke that says all Buddhists are either meditating or feeling guilty about not meditating.  So if someone is telling you that you ""should"" meditate they are quite possibly projecting some of their own guilt about their own spiritual practice onto you.  Of course had they been practicing meditation by being ""mindful"" in the conversation with you (this is just code for ""paying attention to their own thoughts and feelings while not sitting in silence somewhere""), they would see that this is what their feelings were doing and they'd probably choose not to pressure you like that.<p>Anyway, hope this helps.",1364357453

So early Sunday morning(2am ish) I send out a bunch of applications. By Wednesday I had a new job with payed more than what most of the guys I went to college with earn(in some cases it might be as much as 2x), had a standing job offer from another place for when I leave the job I hadn't even started yet, one co-founder pushing me to come over for an interview and offered to better what ever I'd make at the other place, plus 3 other inquiries.<p>And all that with a few half decent projects on github and a passionate(I think so) about me thing on the resume.<p>Granted that there are a lot more better programmers available in the US than there are here in India(my boss was shocked by the level of most coders he interviewed), but still it seems doable - getting a job solely on coding chops.<p>I'm not saying that if you start applying you'll get a job the next day or even the next week or the next month.

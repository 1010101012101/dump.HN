It&#x27;s definitely a contribution to the discussion here to read the entire fine article, whether it is published in the <i>New York Times</i> or in some other publication. Thorough examination of an argument based on more than just the source or the title of the submission is helpful to other participants here.<p>As for the argument in the article, which I see online with a title &quot;America’s Best Days May Be Behind It&quot; and a still image from the The Dick Van Dyke Show, I think the best part of the article&#x27;s argument is the yeah-but part, where optimism is expressed.<p>&quot;What Professor Gordon fails to account for, Professor Mokyr argues, is that the information technology revolution and other recent developments produced mind-blowing tools and techniques, from gene-sequencing machines to computers that analyze mountains of data at blistering speed. This is creating vast new opportunities for innovation, from health care to materials technology and beyond.<p>&#x27;The tools available to science have been improving at a dazzling rate,&#x27; he told me. &#x27;I’m not sure how, but the world of technology in 30 to 40 years’ time will be vastly different than it is today.&#x27;&quot;<p>I am older than most participants on Hacker News. My family is plainly better off than my parents&#x27; family, even though we have fewer total hours of labor force participation per year than my parents jointly had, with the same number of children (four). I can remember a LOT of predictions from my youth that the world would go to hell by the time I was a young adult. It hasn&#x27;t happened. Prosperity and healthy lifespan and levels of education are rising all over the world. Yeah, the world is still full of problems, but our supply of problem-solving tools and our scope of choice about what problems to solve when is better than ever.",1453319990

The precise answer heavily depends on your use case (what &quot;task&quot; is? scalability requirements, data flow), so please ask your question in Frontera google groups, and we will try to address it directly.<p>First you could try making use of Frontera, here are the different distribution models it provides out of the box <a href=""http://frontera.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/run-modes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://frontera.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/run-modes.h...</a>. Frontera is web crawling framework made in Scrapinghub, providing crawl frontier and scaling/distribution capabilities. Along with flexible queue and partitioning design, you will get also document metadata storage (HBase or RDBMS of your choice) with simple revisiting mechanism.<p>Second, we have a simple redis-based solution for scaling spiders <a href=""https://github.com/rolando/scrapy-redis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rolando/scrapy-redis</a>. It&#x27;s only dependency is Redis, so it&#x27;s easy to quick start, but it has only one queue shared between spiders, hard-coded partitioning, and Redis limiting scalability.<p>You mentioned a scrapy-cluster (not scrapyd-cluster probably). It provides a more sophisticated distribution model, allowing you to separate crawls with jobs concept within the same service, maintains separate per-spider queues (allowing to crawl politely, I hope you plan to do so? :), and forcing you to use it&#x27;s prioritization model. Also it allows to use spiders of different types sharing the same Redis instance, and prioritize requests on cluster level. BTW, I haven&#x27;t found any dependencies on Zookeeper.<p>None of the solutions provides provisioning out of the box. If spider was killed by OOM, or consume too much resources (open file descriptors, memory) you have to take care of it by yourself. You could use supervisord, or upstart or some custom process management solution. It all depends on you monitoring requirements.<p>Good luck choosing the right solution!<p>A.",1453319746

I think Node is very versatile and solid. I dont see anything niche about it. It does very few basic jobs well, 1) providing a good package system (NPM) and 2) giving us javascript on the backend.

That&#x27;s the edited down version!<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot of mileage left in the emacs + org-mode for productivity discussion, so I can completely see where you&#x27;re coming from. I won&#x27;t repeat what I said in the post here, but I&#x27;ll just reiterate this HN comment[0] from 2 month&#x27;s back where a frequent user of org-mode complained about backwards-compatibility. And this isn&#x27;t an isolated case, the devs are apparently forging ahead with the simplification of org-mode at the expense of a few compatibility issues. I don&#x27;t suppose users of the basic functionality would notice, but then do those users <i>need</i> all the potential complexity of org-mode?<p>I&#x27;ll also reiterate that, as per the citations in the post, even RMS can&#x27;t bring himself to broach the org-mode subject. At least as of 2013.<p>It probably boils down to there being two camps, those who make full use of org-mode&#x27;s features <i>and</i> who enjoy delving into the minutae of configuring their productivity suites (most likely already emacs users?). And then there are those who can run their affairs from a paper diary (or who have help), 80s style, but prefer going digital for all the advantages that brings.<p>I might be wrong, but I get the strong impression from seeing others use it that org-mode lets you, even encourages you to operate a system that holds hundreds of to-do&#x27;s at any one time.

10940801,comment,10939306,10939942,0,0,bzbarsky,,,"It&#x27;s all about distances.  The planets we can see with the naked eye are at most 11AU from us (Saturn is at 10AU at aphelion).<p>For comparison, Neptune is never closer than about 29AU to us.  Brightness goes down as the square of the distance.  But it gets worse, because that&#x27;s brightness at given source brightness.  Planets don&#x27;t radiate intrinsically; they reflect sunlight.  And sunlight brightness drops off as the square of distance from the sun.  Which is to say that even if they were the same size and albedo (they&#x27;re not), Neptune would appear about 81 times dimmer than Saturn to us.  Oh, also (linear) angular size goes down linearly with distance.  So if you want to see the two planets as disks of the same size, you need to have a field of view three times narrower, which means you need 9 times as many of them to cover the sky.  And if you want the same amount of light gathered, you have to spend 81 times longer gathering it, per the above brightness calculation.<p>All of which is to say that the time needed to do an &quot;equivalent&quot; sky survey N times further away (within the solar system, where all the illumination is coming from the sun) scales as N^6.  And planets do move, so you might still miss one if you survey a place where it&#x27;s not yet, then take a while to get to where it used to be, such that it has moved.  This is why Neptune was found via its gravitational interactions followed by a survey of a small part of the sky, not brute-force observation.<p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, the proposed Planet Nine orbits 20 times farther out than Neptune.  20^6 is 64 million.  So if we assume we&#x27;ve pretty much surveyed everything out to the radius of Neptune&#x27;s orbit at some resolution, and then spent about 64000 times as much time surveying stuff out to the distance Planet Nine is proposed to be at, at the same resolution (I doubt we have), then we&#x27;ve probably surveyed about 0.1% of the stuff out there.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you what the actual number is, unfortunately, but I suspect the answer is we haven&#x27;t really done very good systematic surveys out at that distance.",1453319271

Could the confinement of the orbits be due to an observational bias or a mere coincidence (after all, we are talking about six objects here - not exactly “big data”)? Thankfully, the probability of the observed alignment being fortuitous can be assessed in a statistically rigorous manner, and clocks in at right around 0.007%. Not a great gamble. Moreover, application of simple perturbation theory (or direct numerical integration) demonstrates that if allowed to evolve under the gravitational influence of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, the orbits would become randomly oriented on timescales much shorter than than the multi-billion year lifetime of the solar system. So the dynamical origin of the peculiar structure of the Kuiper belt cannot be outsourced to the distant past - something is holding the orbits together <i>right now</i>.&quot;",1453318928

It was pretty much a crap-fest of lowest-common-denominator programming that was created based on who sold the most ads. It left out large sections of the population (minorities, women, LGBT, etc.) for the most part, relegating them to stereotypes, if they were mentioned at all. It also limited content that discussed topics that were unpleasant to the media gateways.

Why would I want to? I&#x27;ll explain in a second. In Poland I have a visa debit + mastercard debit cards for the same account.<p>- the cards have a limit of 300 pounds for ATM withdrawals. There is not way to change that limit, I&#x27;ve asked at a few banks and that&#x27;s just what it is, even in an emergency. With my Polish bank, I can log in online and change it on their website - I can set it to any amount, 100k a day if I want to. I used my Polish card to withdraw few thousand pounds out of an ATM in UK and it worked fine(the ATM itself had a limit of 400 pounds per transaction but I just used it a few times and it worked fine). I can also set a separate limit for internet transactions - which is why I have two cards. One card that I carry with me all the time but which has 0 limit on internet transactions, and another card which always stays at home but which has 0 limit on ATM and over the counter transactions. If someone steals the card that is on me they can&#x27;t use it on the internet, and if someone steals the card at home they can&#x27;t use it to withdraw cash or to pay for stuff.<p>- No ability to see pending transactions online on my debit cards until they clear. This one is absolutely crazy to me. How can I know if someone hasn&#x27;t stolen my money if I can&#x27;t see pending transactions? The only way to do that is to call the bank. As far as I know, only lloyds shows pending transactions online, Barclays had it as a &quot;suggestion&quot; for ages now.<p>- Credit cards. In Poland, I apply for a certain limit when applying for a card and I either get it or I don&#x27;t. In UK, you apply for a card, have to sign all the documents for the card, and only after the card arrives I can see what sort of limit was given me. If I don&#x27;t like it, there&#x27;s nothing I can do - well, I could ring the bank and ask, but they don&#x27;t have to increase it.

And it appears that because they simply took a position seemingly contradictory (in the lightest sense of the word) to mine, they have been spared any amount of criticism despite significantly diminishing any hope of constructive conversation. Quite honestly, if I had simply ignored these responses there&#x27;d be far less noise and general non-sense.

And again, this type of problem and others like it are something that the industry as a whole has plenty of talent do deal with and appropriately handle.

I see it far too often, especially professionally.<p>Oh and let&#x27;s not forget this is all on a post about the schism between development motivations in the Meteor community.<p>Calling me a troll for not using an endearing tone and having a question that is part of a larger conversation on the state of the tech industry is maddening.

A lot happening under the hood with video to make the swaps near instant. I had to play around with GPU acceleration and CSS transforms to manipulate the streams.<p>- Load three streams simultaneously, when you swap out the primary stream, the other two streams are muted automatically.<p>- A powerful compact stream browser accessible to your left. I&#x27;ve tried to make it so you can scan a whole lot of streams at once to pick out the most interesting ones.<p>- Auto-refreshing stream list. Hopefully you won&#x27;t even notice it reloading. It&#x27;s always kept up to date to minimize any offline streamers and catch your favorite streamers coming online.<p>- Drag and drop streams into screens, click on screens to promote them to the primary. A lot of small miscellaneous things that hopefully make Teevox more intuitive.<p>- Auto bandwidth optimization, when you select a very high quality stream (ex: Source), instead of switching all three to high quality, it&#x27;ll only do it for the primary stream. When you swap out for another primary stream, it will seamlessly transition into the proper quality.<p>The best part was the static HTML portion that allows it to load almost instantly without any preprocessing necessary.

I&#x27;m exaggerating my story a little bit of course.<p>Anyway, on the adjusted figure, the US comes in at nr 28, which is certainly not a great place to be as there aren&#x27;t all that many developed countries, let alone rich developed countries.<p>Further, the HDI is really lacking in certain areas. But it&#x27;s decent, unlike the &#x27;OECD better life&#x27; index which is a complete joke.<p>Beyond that, anyone taking a serious look at our society would have to conclude it&#x27;s much better off across the board than before. Look at education rates, crime rates, life expectancy, civil rights, it&#x27;s a world of difference in some cases. Drugs is somewhat a new issue that didn&#x27;t exist in the same fashion long ago (although already better than the 80s for example), and poverty remains tricky. But even there, I&#x27;m a kid from a poor family from a minority background and I&#x27;ve traveled and studied in different continents, have advanced degrees, a decent job. There&#x27;s opportunity for me that simply wasn&#x27;t there, as you mention, some decades ago. And to be poor today usually means you have access to a basic quality of life that simply wasn&#x27;t available back then. I know plenty of people who didn&#x27;t have warm water growing up, showered at the neighbours or some public facility. That&#x27;s virtually unthinkable in western-europe today, as I would assume to a large extent it is in the US. I won&#x27;t even go into the value of something like the internet that cost me growing up the equivalent of 4 hours of wages in a supermarket per month, and from which I gained priceless value, the fact my wealth didn&#x27;t grow during this time versus the wealth of similar people 50 years ago, didn&#x27;t capture the immense wealth I had accessible to me that they didn&#x27;t. These things are not always easy to capture in terms of GDP growth, if anything the &#x27;added value&#x27; of a telephone or postal service that got swallowed up by dirt cheap instant messaging, probably reduced GDP if anything.<p>And worldwide... oh man, TREMENDOUS progress we somehow don&#x27;t celebrate. I mean just compare the number of kids under 5 who die per year of preventable issues today and say in 1995, just 20 years ago. A quick hint, the annual figure roughly halved and it&#x27;s equivalent to roughly the holocaust (6 million deaths) being prevented every single year. Poverty reduction is hugely positive, too, as is primary and secondary school attendance and healthcare. It&#x27;s quite amazing how shitty things were, and how ignorantly nostalgic we are.",1453317345

Any external dependency is a trade-off between the extra value you get, typically through saving time and/or solving a problem better than you know how to do yourself, against the overheads.<p>The key point in this case is that I just don&#x27;t see much extra value in Gulp and its plugin ecosystem. As shown in my examples above, it&#x27;s a whole load of extra mechanics to replace literally one-liner CLI operations. On most projects I&#x27;ve seen try to adopt Gulp, it wasn&#x27;t clear that the Gulp-based tooling was actually more effective even when everything did work properly, which is why as you&#x27;ve probably figured out by now I&#x27;m not much of a fan.<p><i>But by complicate the matter, I mean multiple files with multiple tasks to perform on those same files that results in a single output for each original file. [...] Now, I&#x27;m assuming all this can be done without gulp, but does using gulp not help with this task?</i><p>I don&#x27;t think I can give an informed opinion about your specific example without knowing more about the details. All I can say with confidence is that in the more complicated multi-stage build processes I&#x27;ve worked with, I&#x27;ve yet to find Gulp an advantage over plain old scripting of the kind we&#x27;ve been using for a decade or five. Shell scripting was made for this kind of automation work, and if you prefer more general programming tools or need cross-platform portability then you can write similar logic straightforwardly in any number of programming languages, without all the complication that these &quot;task runners&quot; introduce.<p>At that point, you have far more flexibility as well. That makes a noticeable difference if you want to do things not quite within the target area of a tool like Gulp, such as processing of two different types of file together. How do you wrangle Gulp&#x27;s stream-based approach into, say, hashing CSS or JS filenames for cache-busting purposes and then incorporating the appropriate hashed filenames into your HTML files&#x27; headers?

The federal appellate courts have been pretty negative on the practice.  See 653 F.3d 426 (6th Cir. 2011).[1]<p>That being said, criminal trials are inherently statistical and that admits some level of inconsistency. If the standard of conviction is say 95% certainty, the evidence might prove a 95% probability of guilt, while still leaving a range of facts undefined (e.g. where exactly was Halbach killed?) In fact, it&#x27;s possible for the evidence to establish a 95% probability of guilt for two different people, even when only one could be guilty.<p>Thus, the focus of courts reviewing these sorts of cases seems to be not on whether the theories are inconsistent, but on the prosecutor&#x27;s ethical duty to submit only evidence they believe to be true. In the <i>Stumpf</i> case, the prosecutor presented in Wesley&#x27;s trial a statement from a jail-house informant that Wesley admitted to being the one to pull the trigger. He did not present that evidence at Stumpf&#x27;s plea hearing, and in a subsequent proceeding with Stumpf, argued that the jail-house witness was not credible. The problem was not that the two theories were inconsistent, but that in either the trial or the later hearing, the prosecutor must have advanced evidence he thought to be false.<p>[1] In that case, there were two defendants accused of participating in the murder, but it was unclear who actually &quot;pulled the trigger.&quot; One, Stumpf, pled guilty to aggravated murder, and in his plea hearing the state argued he was the primary shooter. He was sentenced to death. In the trial of the other, Wesley, the state argued that he was the primary shooter. He was sentenced to life. Stumpf filed a habeas petition in federal court. The Supreme Court held that the inconsistent theories did not require vacating Stumpf&#x27;s guilty plea, because under Ohio law an accomplice who did not actually pull the trigger could be guilty of aggravated murder. However, it remanded to the Sixth Circuit to determine whether the inconsistent theories necessitated re-sentencing. On remand, the Sixth Circuit held that the inconsistent theories did violate Stumpf&#x27;s due process rights and granted his habeas petition, unless Ohio granted him a re-sentencing.",1453316825

Think of art (how do you pay for an amazing digital image) to music (pay for one song) to journalism (how do you pay for one article) to games to FOSS code to expert Q&A to much more. Financing these endeavors could lead to much more and much better.<p>2) It can solve much of the privacy problem, assuming the micropayments are cash-like and not tracked. I hope anonymity, which you mention in your comment, and all aspects of confidentiality are being designed and built in as core functions.<p>3) It could enable automated rights clearinghouses in many fields. Do you want to use part of that code/song/etc. in your work? No need to contact the rights holder and negotiate a contract, an impossibly high transaction cost for most, just use the micropayment system. Much of art in the digital age is, or should be, collage. As they say, &#x27;good artists borrow, great artists steal&#x27;.<p>In my mind, it could be the most important IT innovation for culture, code, and many other aspects of society.",1453316652

I don&#x27;t think Meteor is a cure-all panacea or that it&#x27;s the Best Framework Ever®. I&#x27;ve come to Meteor with a fair bit of experience (Play 1.0/2.0, Sails.js, Flask, etc.) and a fair bit of skepticism. However, I really don&#x27;t think much went wrong with Meteor. In fact, it treads some of the same ground as its predecessors. As far as OP&#x27;s article is concerned, I have some very specific squabbles with it:<p>> This creates a bigger barrier to entry compared to front-end frameworks like React and Angular, or server languages like Go or Elixir.<p>Okay, Meteor has an arguably bigger barrier to entry than React or Angular (maybe), but definitely 100% <i>not</i> Go or Elixir. I think this is just disingenuous.<p>> I believe some of Meteor’s early choices may have ended up handicapping it. For example, Meteor’s focus on real-time applications makes them a lot easier to build compared to any other platform out there. But it does also come at the cost of hidden complexity, and potential performance problems down the road.<p>This is the #1 problem of every framework, ever. Mr. Greif is not saying much, if anything at all.<p>> Once a new Meteor user starts to go beyond the basics and look into things like routing, pagination, subscription caching & management, server-side rendering, or database joins, they realize that the difficulty curve quickly ramps up.<p>Here, he&#x27;s conflating things that are easy (routing and pagination) with things that are hard (subscription caching), so it&#x27;s hard to see exactly what the criticism is here. Not to mention that Iron Router are pretty mature. I haven&#x27;t run into a routing issue yet that it couldn&#x27;t solve. As far as joins and caching, etc., these are definitely difficult things. I don&#x27;t think <i>any</i> framework out there completely (and in the general case) solves these out-of-the-box. Maybe someone could introduce me to one.<p>> The result of all this is that Meteor has ended up in an awkward place.<p>I think it just ended up where almost all other frameworks end up: useful, but not completely generalized. In fact, I think striving for a very high degree generality might be a mistake, lest we want to end up with something like Hibernate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Meteor-Josh-Robinson/dp/1430268360"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Meteor-Josh-Robinson/dp/14...</a>",1453316405

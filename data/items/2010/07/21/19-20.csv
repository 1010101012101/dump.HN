1536316,comment,1536166,1536166,0,0,quanticle,,,">Purity Basically the only proper way to write your software in Java is system independent; you’re stuck with the common denominator. On the server side this usually isn’t the biggest problem, but when you do client stuff, you might want to use the system tray in Windows. No! Thou shallt write pure code! Oh sorry, I bought this really cool OS that has all those cool features, but now I can’t use them because that’d affect my purity. Get the f@#$)(#@$*@#!<p>First, this limitation is true of any ""cross-platform"" language.  If you're writing ""pure"" Python, you don't get to use the system tray either.  Of course, both Java and Python have native interfaces (via JNI and C extensions, respectively), so you do get to use the system tray if you choose to do so.  You'll just need to leave the world of the least common denominator and write an interface to the native OS.<p>>In Java not everything is an object (or can be treated that way): there’s also primitives. Primitives (int, float, char, double, byte, …) are radically different than objects. The only reason they’re here is for speed’s sake, and to complicate things more. This sucks.<p>I do agree with this point.  In retrospect, something like C#'s autoboxing would go a long way towards smoothing over the distinction between objects and primitive types.  I haven't programmed Java in years, though.  Does it have autoboxing yet?",1279741727

It's vain when you're more concerned with what you have to say than whether people will enjoy hearing it.<p>I get genuinely angry when I go to a gig or a show where it's obvious that the performers are self-absorbed and have no interest in the audience. The audience have paid to come into town, they've paid for their tickets, they are paying for drinks at the bar, the least the band can do is try to entertain them. When bands play indulgent solos or play a bad song that the drummer has written, they're insulting their audience by saying that their ego as a band is more important than the enjoyment of the fans.<p>If you keep a diary or paint purely for your own pleasure then that's fine, the problem comes when you expect people to care about your art. We tell aspiring writers and musicians and artists that they should 'be true to their art', but I think that's dead wrong - I think your duty is to be true to your audience.<p>There's an interesting exception in comedy. A bad comic can't hide - if he's not funny, it's obvious to everyone. Today, comedy is really the only artform where it's acceptable for an audience to boo off a performer, but historically it was commonplace in all performing arts. I think we as a culture should be prepared to say ""no, you haven't worked hard enough on your performance, go home until you're good enough to entertain"". It happens every night at comedy clubs, but rarely anywhere else.<p>I think that mistake is a symptom of the prizes-for-all narcissism that says everyone's opinion matters no matter how ill-informed or poorly thought out, that every crude doodle is a work of art if the doodler <i>really meant it</i>. A fundamental trait of narcissism is magical thinking, the belief that wishing something makes it so.

Consider the Passion Chorale, which  Bach used in (among other things) the Christmas Cantata and the St. Matthew Passion. The tune was originally composed 50 or 100 years earlier by Hans Leo Hassler for a song whose title was something like ""my heart is beguiled by a pretty maid""; the most common words (""O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden"") are from a German translation by Paul Gerhardt of a mediaeval Latin hymn.<p>All of this is not to deny or even to downplay Bach's genius.

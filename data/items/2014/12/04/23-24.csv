Moreover, it only has value relative to the social ecosystem that can exchange it for tangible value. Countless agents, whether public or private, are capable of increasing or decreasing the value of &quot;your&quot; dollar without ever removing it from under your mattress. If the value decreases due to a market failure, did they steal from you? Hypothetically, if someone took 10% at gunpoint, but invested it in a way increased the net value of the remainder by 50%, how about then? It is effectively impossible for private property to live in a social vaccuum in an industrialized economy.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m sympathetic to that knee-jerk feeling.

8702408,comment,8701238,8701238,0,0,tokenadult,,,"The article reports, &quot;Most experts believe it will take combinations of immunotherapy drugs—or combinations of immunotherapy with other cancer treatments—to optimize their impact. But finding safe and effective combinations is a daunting undertaking.&quot; Yes. A lot of researchers, including researchers at companies that could commercialize applications of the latest research findings, are working on the general approach described in this interesting article, because the approach, if refined, promises substantial increase in healthy lifespan for many patients diagnosed with cancer. Making each patient&#x27;s own immune system more responsive to cancerous cells looks like an important part of further advancing cancer treatment.<p>A key idea in medical treatment research is to look for an &quot;endpoint&quot; that actually matters for the patient. When the researchers looked for tumor shrinkage, they sometimes didn&#x27;t find it soon enough to think that the patients were benefitting from treatment, but the patient Tom Telford named in the story reported feeling better during treatment, even when his tumor still appeared to be huge on scans of the tumor. When the researchers looked for the &quot;hard endpoint&quot; of patient survival, they found out these new treatments are better than they had realized at first. Proxy endpoints never beat hard endpoints in evaluating a treatment.<p>One more comment about how the story is presented. I will be really glad when doctors speaking to reporters, who are trying to talk in conversational, understandable language, and the reporters themselves get out of the habit of personifying or anthropomorphizing cancer cells, immune system cells, tumors, or even autonomous human body functions. Cancer cells and immune system cells are not knowing agents. They adapt (that is, successful cells survive while others die) but they don&#x27;t &quot;learn.&quot;",1417737001

The Google Cat Detector model, for example, didn&#x27;t describe a probability distribution over images, which is the kind of task that the preprint is about. And in almost all of the recent cases where deep neural networks have made substantial progress over the previous state of the art, the models have not been probabilistic, or trained layer-by-layer, or unsupervised, like the RBM-based approach in the preprint.<p>I don&#x27;t speak physics, but my reading of the paper says that could be summarized pretty accurately as follows:<p>1. Hinton et al. (2006) showed that each layer in a stack of RBMs improves a variational lower bound on p(x).<p>2. Variational methods for RG also iteratively improve a variational lower bound on p(x).<p>3. The two methods would thus be equivalent, if we could fit them without error (which we can&#x27;t).<p>4.

A lot of people (exclusively non programmers) got swallowed up by the romantic idea of changing the world with this idea which disappeared somewhere and so must be retrievable again with enough thinking. And the direction was given by Sloot; the aforementioned (the only one I personally talked to) person read book &#x27;De Broncode&#x27; (the sourcecode) 100s of times, going over every page with a tooth comb in order to distill the idea he finally thought was the actual algorithm.

Second, the DOM is very much built on an object oriented class hierarchy, and we in rust have put off figuring out how we can support that until after 1.0.

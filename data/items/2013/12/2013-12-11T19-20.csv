6890248,comment,6889036,6890145,22,0,eigenvector,,,"The cost of community mail delivery is not unknown. CMBs have existed for decades and the article states that the cost of home delivery is 130% more. So I would submit that we do actually know the economics of it. The cost differential is about $762 million/year ($269-$117 * 5MM mailboxes).<p>I actually worked part-time as a mail carrier doing home delivery once. It&#x27;s not easy work, especially in the winter. A lot of people don&#x27;t maintain their driveways and walkways in the winter and it can be hazardous especially when you&#x27;re carrying 15 kg or more of mail.<p>CMBs aren&#x27;t high-security. But they&#x27;re surely more secure than unlocked home mailboxes, especially in sleepy suburban neighbourhoods where no one is home for most of the day.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that Canada Post could likely save money in other ways. But this seems to be a rational place to start.",1386791959

6890201,comment,6889604,6889959,23,0,scarmig,,,"That&#x27;s worth some elaboration, though: the water vapor in the atmosphere is (to a very, incredibly rough approximation) a system where the average global vapor concentration oscillates tightly around an equilibrium point. More than that, the average residence time in the atmosphere is a bit over a week. So when you say we can&#x27;t change it, it&#x27;s very true in one sense: if we vaporized the Mediterranean into the atmosphere, well before a month had gone by it&#x27;d have precipitated back to the liquid state on the Earth&#x27;s surface.<p>On the other hand, what you said could be misunderstood to mean that human activities have no effect on the average water vapor concentrations, and that&#x27;d be inaccurate. The equilibrium point is determined in large part by global temperatures: the higher they are, the more water vapor is pulled into the atmosphere. And we do have a mechanism to increase atmospheric temperatures: CO2.<p>CO2 by itself is fairly limited in terms of temperatures: doubling its atmospheric concentrations only increases average global temperatures by about a degree, which is simple to calculate and more or less undisputed. But what really kills us (and where uncertainties creep in) is in the positive feedback loops, the biggest of which is water vapor. A degree increase in temperature from CO2 alone results in an additional couple degrees of increase in temperature due to the effects of increased water vapor.<p>Combine a couple of those positive feedback loops, and you&#x27;ve got a problem.",1386791611

A number of third party vendors will only support one of the Enterprise Linux distributions (RedHat, Suse, Oracle Linux, etc).  Now the technical differences between RHEL and, say Fedora, is that RHEL gives you a long time of getting bug / security fixes that are &quot;minimally invasive&quot;, that is you can apply them and have a very good chance that your existing configuration and apps still work without a reinstall ore reconfiguration.  (This is what is meant by &quot;stability&quot;).<p>For personal use, you can get similar stability from either CentOS or Scientific Linux, although the bug fixes will lag behind Red Hat by a few days (although some critical updates have been released only a few hours after Red Hat).",1386791523

In particular, this should further some functional inter-relationship with the outside world<p>> These are good arguments, in many ways. Enough so that the burden of proof should be on those putting for completely contrary ideas<p>I respectfully disagree. My instinct is to question your premise that &quot;man is happy only when exercising his facilities.&quot; I&#x27;m assuming that this has roots in ancient Greek philosophy, and I&#x27;m not well versed enough in that area to refute the reasoning that leads to that premise, but I will say that I&#x27;m hesitant to accept it at face value. Even if scientific studies indicated that man is happy only when exercising his facilities, it would only indicate that exercising your facilities has instrumental value in providing us with satisfaction, not intrinsic value.<p>To me, this idea that productivity is an objective Good seems like a statement of personal values rather than anything fundamental to the Universe. Of course, personal values matter; I&#x27;m just trying to draw a line here between productivity as a means to an end vs. productivity as intrinsically necessary. If someone is able to achieve happiness without &quot;exercising his facilities,&quot; I don&#x27;t think we can assume that their happiness must be impoverished compared to those pursuing more mainstream paths, even if our gut instinct tells us otherwise.<p>And to reiterate: this is ignoring, for the sake of argument, the topic of negative externalities.

6890060,comment,6889204,6889204,83,0,JunkDNA,,,">We now have the tools to create viruses in labs. What happens when someone creates a virus that spreads extremely easily, has greater than 50% mortality, and has an incubation period of several weeks? Something like this, released by a bad guy and without the world having time to prepare, could wipe out more than half the population in a matter of months.  Misguided biotech could effectively end the world as we know it<p>Sam is a smart guy, so I really don&#x27;t want to come off as sounding like a jerk here, but this grossly underestimates the technical feasibility of creating such a virus. Computer folks routinely overestimate how much biologists actually know about the systems we study. We know jack about how the vast majority of biology works. We have the most fleeting glimpses of understanding that are regularly crushed by the complexity of dynamic systems with nested feedback loops and multiple semi-overlapping redundancies. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s impossible, but we don&#x27;t even know enough to know whether the three things: high mortality, long incubation, and ease of transmission are even possible. While we can imagine it, there might be biological and epidemiological factors that prevent such a thing from existing.<p>This also commits the logical fallacy of ascribing superpowers to the bad guys cooking up viruses while assuming the good guys are sitting on their duffs letting bad things happen. H5N1 was a pretty good example of international collaboration. There were academic competitors and industrial labs working around the clock collaboratively on it in the early days before much was known. Whole vaccine divisions at pharmas were all over it. If we&#x27;re instead talking about a mythical time in the future when we <i>do</i> understand enough biology to engineer something like this, one would have to assume the good guys possess the knowledge to develop countermeasures.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that pandemics aren&#x27;t something we should worry about. Europeans were almost wiped out by the plague and in modern times Africa has been decimated by HIV. These are <i>real</i> problems that the human race has faced and will likely face again, irrespective of lab-created stuff. Biotechnology is the primary mechanism by which we&#x27;re going to be able to survive when the next one comes, wherever it comes from.<p>EDIT: Fixed wrong word usage in 2nd sentence.",1386790677

Even the greeks could quit the EU at any time, but they cannot quit their debts which they entered into as a sovereign nation. Greece lied, for years, about their ability to repay loans, to get more loans than they could handle, and they even went so far as to ask big american financial companies to help them cook their books, which shows it wasn&#x27;t just a lapse in judgment. Now, in the defense of greece, all the other EU countries knew they were lying from the beginning, and they pretended they didn&#x27;t because they wanted to prove people like you wrong and show the EU could bring prosperity to all including the greece. In the line of bad ideas, that only comes second to the german notion that greece must repay their loans in full, even if it bankrupts them. So, yeah, everybody messed up gloriously.<p>That still doesn&#x27;t change a thing to the fact that the EU process has brought peace to half a billion people for the first time since never, and with peace has come prosperity for most (sadly not all though). The current Europe is however still better for its people than any Europe in history, despite its many flaws.<p>I know europe-bashing is popular in many regions in europe right now because things are bad and it&#x27;s an easy scape-goat for inept or incapable national governments and an easy target for jingoistic parties hoping to channel frustration and fear into votes (&#x27;populism&#x27;), but no rational analysis can say that europe is the cause of the current economic woes, except perhaps for the greeks. I see only two paths out of this situation: (1) less EU, nationalism and protectionism, and (2) more EU, moving democracy up to the EU level by giving true power to the EU parliament. The first path takes us back to the europe that was, a continent rife with war and poverty. I&#x27;ll take option 2 thank you very much.<p>Btw, marxism, really?

Both in individual life and on the scale of societies, what we typically call &quot;civilization&quot; is nothing more or less than an unending war against entropy; this is frequently, if imprecisely, formalized in the common dictum that &quot;it&#x27;s easier to destroy than to create&quot; -- and easier, too, to sit in one&#x27;s own filth than otherwise, in the absence of some motivation to do otherwise. Unhappiness serves to provide this motivation, and it is therefore precisely that motivation which the lotus-eater machine removes. After all, if sitting in your own filth doesn&#x27;t make you unhappy, because you have a wire in your brain which ensures sublime delight no matter your circumstances, why bother to do anything about it? -- and, as we see from one of the cases described in the page I linked, indeed you will not.<p>Consider, too, that the English language already has a well-known and clearly defined word for the concept of &quot;pure, unmoderated happiness&quot;. That word is <i>heroin</i>, and while I recognize the modern unpopularity of the proposition among those who&#x27;ve never seen firsthand what it does to its unfortunate devotees, I maintain most firmly that that damned drug is illegal for excellent reason.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://mindhacks.com/2008/09/16/erotic-self-stimulation-and-brain-implants/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mindhacks.com/2008/09/16/erotic-self-stimulation-and-...</a>",1386788446

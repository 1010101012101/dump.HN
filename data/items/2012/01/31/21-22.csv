3535382,comment,3534746,3534746,16,0,chubot,,,"Why isn't Lua more widely used?  One reason is a consequence of it being an embedded language.  Lua has had 5 major versions which are <i>very</i> incompatible with each other.  You're just supposed to stick with the previous version until you upgrade your code.<p>I read all the Lua papers, and they are quite fond of ""getting it right"" (which is refreshing).  They will break things to get it right, whereas other languages stick with all their old design warts in the name of compatibility.  I like this approach, but it comes at the expense of popularity.<p>Compare Lua with Python, which has had basically 1 major version for 20 years Python 1.x are all compatible with 2.x -- that was a license change; and Python 3 is having adoption troubles which proves the same point.  Python 3 was the chance to ""get things right"", or fix old design warts, but you can see what a big impact it's having on adoption, fragmentation of libraries, etc.<p>The other reason is that embedding a language isn't as common a use case as a scripting language.  I've tried to write stuff in Lua rather than Python, but really Python's ""batteries included"" philosophy just kills any advantage Lua has.<p>The main reason I would like Lua is so you can distribute stable (small) executables... but when you're starting out Python is a lot easier.  You don't want to download LuaSocket or whatever and mess with the build system.",1328046959

I've worked with film and video for 20 years, including professionally.<p>That the outcry comes from people who completely ignore the massive advance in usability that FCPX represents, and instead focus on outdated (output to tape) and things that are supported by third party or FCP suite applications (7 to X migration, output in raw) tells me that this is not an outcry of creative professionals.<p>Sure there are a lot of people cutting together formulaic reality TV shows who want to preserve their workflow.  That's fine, stay with FCP 7.<p>If preserving your workflow is your primary concern then you're not the target of this product, yet.   FCP 7 didn't stop working.<p>You have failed to mention any serious features that it is missing, yet you say it ""might be a good tool for a small time editor that needs an occasional video, but it is not up to professional standards yet.""<p>This is exactly the same kind of nonsensical argument I hear from Canon fans.  To them, Canon cameras are ""professional"" and everything else isn't, because they don't have the ""Canon"" name on them and therefore, can't possibly be ""professional.""<p>Its circular nonsense.<p>You, not a single person complaining about FCP X here or elsewhere, has named a single creative feature missing from FCP X, or otherwise justified the claim that its not ""professional"".<p>The references to what ""professionals"" need is an example of the fallacy of argument from authority. ""I'm professional, therefore you're an nitwit if you disagree"".  Worse, its argument from false authority because nobody here is appointed to decide what is and is not ""professional"".<p>FCP X has been enthusiastically embraced by the editing community.  That's my point. They're not the ones complaining (who I suspect are all on the payroll of Adobe or Avid, or otherwise bought into those systems....)<p>If the outcry were legitimate, the people engaging in it would be able to recognize that FCP X has moved the state of the art of editing forward significantly.  They do not, they only talk about what they claim is missing, and often claim things are missing that actually aren't, but are just different (Showing they haven't even used the product enough to give a ""professional"" opinion.)",1328046924

Tables are a versatile data structure that can be used as arrays, dictionaries, objects, etc.  However, Lua provides many types besides tables: numbers, booleans, closures (functions), strings (which are interned), coroutines, and something called userdata (which are typically pointers to something implemented in C).<p>Another cool thing about Lua, which was mentioned only briefly in the article, is proper tail-call optimization (TCO) like you'd find in Scheme.  TCO makes expressing recursive algorithms nicer because you don't have to worry about blowing your stack.<p>Lua's design philosophy -- giving the programmer a handful of basic yet powerful features -- makes it somewhat Schemy.

I am a little perturbed to see him mentioned on the site.<p>The design of the site in question was good, no doubt, but it was also riddled with a stolen Neutraface2 font face and the HTML didn't validate.  And there was no RoR backend; the whole site was hosted on a GoDaddy shared server.<p>From my understanding of the dispute, the site was delivered many months late, and then the designer doubled his price.  When Storm refused to pay double for late work, the designer linked in an overlay from a file hosted on Dropbox that announced 'This site was stolen'.  That was the 'kill switch'.  The designer also made a few blog posts and tweets bragging about his 'kill switch', which he later took down.<p>This lead to a panicked call from Storm to me to move the site over to my servers until the dispute could be resolved.

Argh.<p>But the larger, systemic problem with it is that I don't think it works as advertised for raw newbies to the language.  It's <i>perfect</i> for those of us who dimly remember the ""rules"" of a language and just need a lot of structured practice to get up to speed.  But by presenting nothing but example text to translate, they're basically asking the newbie to induce a complete grammar of the language without any guidance, and while children learn their first language(s) that way, adults don't.<p>(Example: in German, the ending that attaches to an adjective can be one of six or seven things depending on the case of the phrase, the gender and number of the noun it attaches to, and the definiteness of the article that commands the phrase.  <i>None</i> of this is explained within Duolingo; it just throws a bunch of example sentences at you, never talking about gender, number, case, or definiteness (two of which are concepts that aren't even relevant to English grammar).  That's... tricky.)<p>On the crowdsourcing translation front, it has an incredible strength, which is that native English speakers will be <i>great</i> at evaluating whether a sentence is fluent, valid English.  But it has an incredible weakness, which is that native English speakers who are just learning German are much less good at evaluating whether a sentence is a valid translation <i>of what the German sentence says</i>.  I've seen quite a few situations where a particular translation has been heavily upvoted despite missing some crucial part of the source sentence's meaning (and in a few cases, meaning exactly the opposite).<p>But it's a work in progress, of course.  It seems to have a lot of promise, so perhaps they can surmount these difficulties.",1328045977

Sure a better programmer would have finished the programming aspects in a quarter the time it took me, but I started by looking at Objective-C and I'm not sure I ever would have picked it up without some kind of formal training. Contrast with Corona/Lua, where I watched a few eight minute videos on YouTube and could turn around and make simple but complete programs, and more importantly completely understand what was going on within them.

Requires loads of resources, political clout to convince the product owner of that system to allocate resources to your own property, and a long lead time to train the filters. Not much scope to adjust the filters<p>* A ""customer complaint"" mechanism (flag this comment type links), that go to a customer service centre (in the Phillipines, I think), and they endeavour to look at complaints, and potentially do something within 24 to 48 hours.<p>Editors on typical Yahoo properties are reminded that they themselves are not allowed to delete or remove comments from the site since that exposes Yahoo to accusations of censorship. Although, a number of editors and engineers quietly ignore that decree and try to clean up their properties individually.<p>Neither of these options are workable. I've not seen a successful case study of the filter approach, and we've all seen what happens with the 24/48 hour response time of the first party support - the trolls and the spam stay around, and only get cleaned out (if they ever are) way after the topicality of the thread has finished. Yahoo News continues to suffer horribly with these methods.<p>Out of all Yahoo properties, only Flickr seem to have had a handle on community moderation. They were the leading light on that during my time at Yahoo.<p>Yahoo simply does not understand the nature of community and believes that moderation can just be automatically applied. It's not an organisation geared towards providing a human face. Flickr has always been the exception here, showing the value that can be achieved by human empowered community nurturing.

3535205,comment,3533386,3533386,7,0,sha90,,,"The only thing wrong with C-11 as it stands currently are the digital lock provisions. Everything else in the bill is rather liberal, and, frankly, some of the provisions are outright <i>good</i> for Canadians (limits on fines, ISP liability exemptions, educational use exemptions, ""mashup"" exemptions). Calling for protests against the bill in its entirety is ignorant and blaming ""the majority government"" for passing draconian laws is outright sensationalist and false. That's not really how we do things here in Canada. There's a better way to get things done, and it doesn't involve hyperbole.<p>Yes, the digital locks portions of the bill could use some reworking-- but as mentioned, the enforceability of the law as its codified now is questionable, so I wonder how big of a deal it would <i>actually</i> be for the law to be passed as is. Remember, as pointed out, use of VCRs is also technically illegal, but you don't see any enforcement of that. The issue surrounding digital locks may very well have the same practical effect. We should certainly try to get these provisions changed before they are codified, but IMO it's not really the end of the world.<p>Yes, there is going to be a lot of push from powerful lobbyists to get ""SOPA-like"" provisions into the bill. However that is a reason to remain vigilant, not a reason to pre-emptively black out the internet again. As it stands, those additions have yet to be added to the bill, so right now, the lobbying power hasn't done very much. Maybe it's just me, but I'm not the type to start blaming people for things that haven't happened yet. I'm going to watch and wait until there <i>is</i> something reminiscent of SOPA in this bill, which may or may not happen.<p>FYI for those who are just jumping on the bus because SOPA is in the title of this article, please read a bit on the issue before injecting your opinion or outrage. Michael Geist is a good and well respected source on this issue. He's come out (more or less) in favour of the bill, minus his open objections to the digital locks portions, which I pointed out above. However, his general approval should say something about the bill-- Geist probably knows a lot more about copyright law in Canada than anyone here does. His comments regarding C-32 (now C-11) can be found in this rather old posting: <a href=""http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5316/125/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5316/125/</a>",1328044169

Instead of being able to SEO the entire Internet, businesses can now only affect the search results for a tiny percentage of users.  That's a good thing because SEO can't scale, and SEO isn't good for users or the Internet at large.<p>If you look at the Google experience from the standpoint of customers, it's pretty good.  Users get relevant search results and ads.  Advertisers get their content on top of everything else.  It's a good compromise between advertising and usability, and it works really well.  It's a bug that you could rank highly in Google without buying ads, and Google is trying to fix the bug.  Manipulating Google results shouldn't be something you feel entitled to be able to do.  If you want to rank highly in Google, be relevant <i>for the user currently searching</i>.  Engage him in social media or email, provide relevant information about what you're selling, and, generally, be a ""good match"" for what the user wants.<p><i>What if Apple created their own applications for 50% of the categories in the app store and then placed their apps at the top of each category?</i><p>They already do this.  Apple's apps are included for free on every phone.  And you aren't allowed to replicate their functionality, either. It's expectee.  Apple makes phones, Apple gets to put whatever they want on the phones.  Google makes search engine results pages, Google gets to put whatever they want on search engine results pages.<p>This isn't quite the right analogy, though.  I can see why MapQuest would be upset about Google Maps and why Yelp would be upset about Google Local.  But even in those cases, Google ranks things as you'd expect.  Yelp results often appear over the Google business pages, because Yelp is more popular for reviews.  So overall, I don't see Google as being evil.  They're being competitive and they make good products.",1328043600

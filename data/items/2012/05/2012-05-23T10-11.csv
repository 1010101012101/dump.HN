Where?",,"Hey,<p>For the past year, I have been reading Hacker News but never had anything constructive to post nor any question. Today, I finally took the time to create an account and ask the community a question I have, hoping somebody can point me in the right direction.<p>At this moment, I have left my job about 4 months ago in order to take on the road of entrepreneurship and partnered with a small dedicated team of people to bring our products to life (and to market). We are inches from creating a legal entity but are looking for one more co-founder. We are based in Switzerland and are looking for someone with marketing and sales skills. Someone who could help us generate a hype on what we do and create a community around our products. Location of this person is not important but we'd like to have somebody who is a native English speaker, preferably based in the US or the UK.<p>Where on the web would you go to find such a person, knowing that at this moment we do not pay a salary but plan to give some equity in the company? Someone who, like us, would bet on our success and dedicate time and efforts towards that goal? Do you know of any communities where such people hang out? Where I could go and try to recruit without being banned for spam?<p>Of course, but there I'm pushing my luck, if you recognize yourself in our current search, you can always drop me a line at nico@logicward.com  ;)<p>Thanks for your time!",1337770557

Bug X has been fixed in project Y. All that stuff doesn't belong in my email inbox.<p>What I'd really like is a single online notification service. I imagine signing up for a service somewhere, and I just plunk my special notification address somewhere in the settings. The service then communicates to that online notification service instead of sending me emails. I could install an app on my phone and desktop (separately configurable) that alerts me. I can set up filters through the app or a web interface.<p>I'm not too hopeful about this ever happening though. No service will support it unless it's mainstream, and using the notification service is useless until most services support it. Chicken and the egg.",1337770513

But negative for the long term development of society<p>- The offensive allowance and use of patents and litigation by powerful people with the intention to slow progress lest they become obsolete.<p>- The lavish displays of opulence despite the fact that people are still starving to death<p>- The still strong existence of classicism<p>- The love to hate relationship society has with divas and their transformation from normal people<p>- The inverse proportional relationship between net-worth and probability of proper enacting of justice<p>- Concentrations of power in government and finance are not typically associated with honesty. Politicians, lawyers and wall street are not held as paragons of noble behavior.<p>- The prevalence of dictators and corrupt rulers in developing nations<p>- The extravagant efforts available and taken by the extremely wealthy to minimizes the relative damage of taxes.<p>- The paucity of efforts like the X Prize, Gates Foundation, Planetary Resources, Space X.<p>- The difficulty in ensuring that money given to charities actually end up being used efficiently (powerful less needy people somehow end up getting the lion's share of this aid).",1337768367

There are companies out there that try to do the right stuff - organic food, healthy stuff, etc, etc. But they struggle. They struggle because 'the good stuff' costs more to produce, therefore they have to charge more. Whilst the 'bad' companies sell unhealthy stuff at a lot lower price, thus yielding better profits. Which in turn means better advertising, better position on shelves, etc. Society is not ready for the change yet.

Trading is stopped all the time by circuit breakers (see Zynga that same day for example), depends on both willing buyers and sellers at a given price, and of course depends on the trading systems not going down for whatever reason. If you're buying as a long term investment of a stock that you believe in this won't affect you. If you're speculating, particularly short-term, you should recognise that the casino is rigged against small investors - the stock market is not, and never will be, rational, fair, or efficient; it's just the least worst option we have. However I don't believe that lack of access to the stock or prices on the first day of trading has anything to do with the current price ($31 last time I looked) - that's just down to a bubble deflating and confidence evaporating as people start asking questions about the true valuation.<p>Frankly I think this sort of talk of the technical issues is really a way of avoiding talking about why people bought Facebook at the initial irrational PE/price which (IMHO) has farther to fall before it becomes a reasonable valuation based on their projected earnings. That's the real issue here, but one which raises hard questions about the very high valuation of many social media companies like Instagram, Facebook etc.",1337768015

Not the greatest UX for first time users.<p>And why is the difference in sound levels so bad. I had two songs, the difference in volume was very jarring. I'd link them but...<p>This brings me to another massive deal killer. The url doesn't change as the band does. I can't copy the address of the presently playing song. And I can't skip back to find out who I was just listening to. And there doesn't seem to be a history function.<p>What's the point in listening to new music if you can't listen to it again and share it? I'm probably a bit of an outlier though, I use that archaic thing called email or chat to share music.<p>Still, I like the ability to add myself to someone's mailing list straight from the app. I'll certainly be checking back here soon. Seems a bit more artist focused than the competitor I won't name again, which is always good.<p>EDIT: Also love the ability to dive into genres.

(This depends on whether its a NYT best-seller, which I don't know off the top of my head.  If it isn't technically, there are other ways to phrase that: sold X00,000 copies, etc.)<p>""Get"" is (testably!) a stronger verb that ""Download"" because people have positive associations with <i>possession</i> and non-positive associations with bits, particularly people who expect their bits to be free.<p>""My copy"" activates those covetous neuroreceptors that really like exclusive ownership of things.  People really like that, even the same folks who will yak your ear off that data cannot be owned: for example, almost all of them will beam with pride when saying ""my favorite band"" as if they have a particular claim to feudal loyalty from the people whose music they most frequently don't pay for.<p>But the point is much, much broader than microcopy on particular pages.  It informs how you'd go about executing on a ""content strategy"" -- for example, if you just take the date off stuff you put into WordPress and stop calling them ""blog posts"" and start calling them ""comprehensive guides to X written by our experts"" customer perceived value will go <i>through the roof</i>.  Seriously, this is testable.<p>I will publish more extensive commentary on the strategic implications of this for software businesses later.

How would exchanging safes in the middle of the night not be noticed? Couldn't the henchmen just open up every room looking for them?<p>Don't safes have built-in locks? My dictionary says a safe is ""a strong fireproof cabinet with a complex lock, used for the storage of valuables."" That definition does exclude some categories of safe, but ""strongbox"" or ""lockbox"" might be a better word.<p>Having now seen the answer here, I didn't even think that the clasp (shouldn't that be ""hasp""?) might be big enough to admit two locks. That seems like a poorly designed safe, since that means the door probably opens enough to admit a crowbar.<p>Yes, I knew when I started that the answer was ""public key cryptography."" I'm just complaining that the puzzle wasn't well stated. Besides, if we're going along those lines, what if the henchmen start sending safes into every room to see if it comes back with an extra lock on it?

I think it's reasonable that the servants don't make off with things genuinely of no value, so locked padlocks without keys, and locked safes, are ""safe"" and not stolen.  I think it's reasonable that they make off with anything remotely of value, such as a padlock and key, or (of course) the amulet, but not the amulet when it's locked in the safe.<p>I agree that the farmer puzzle is nice for kids, but it yields to ""try it, oh, that works, ok, I'm done.""

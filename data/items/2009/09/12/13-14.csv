Several people who saw the boy walking alone called 911. A police officer stopped him, drove him the rest of the way and then reprimanded Mrs. Pierce.</i><p>To me, this is just insane. Walking a mile alone when you're ten years old shouldn't be an issue unless there's a riot going on or something.<p>What are you telling the kids about the world around them when you're terrified of letting them out into it? Not that people in general are decent people who can be trusted to not cause them any trouble, at least. Maybe this is connected to how ""many"" Americans feel they need guns to protect themselves?",1252762959
818917,comment,818157,818862,0,0,chimariko,,,"I am not sure about SRS for learning API of a language. However I have recently started to use mind maps for that. Whenever I come across a new language or library I take an A4 and a pen and put down all basic concepts. It helps to grasp the big picture of the system and to see the interconnections of different blocks of code. I prefer mind maps to the standard linear up-down way of writing stuff down because the schematic representation utilized in mind mapping eases the twist between the way information is stored on paper and (presumably) in the human memory.<p>All in all I find spending some time on studying docs useful in contrast to the pure work-by-doing approach.",1252762922

What the hell is wrong with these people?<p>I think this whole fear is a simple case of the media over-reporting child abductions. I'm curious as to the numbers of abductions over the past 30 years.

818894,comment,818839,818839,0,0,gaius,,,"This definitely resonates with me. I got my first paying Java gig in 1996 (really). Back then, one person could be reasonably expected to know <i>all</i> of Java, and work on any project that was feasible to do in Java, whether that was applets, servers, fancy graphics, database access (no JDBC back then!), anything.<p>Fast forward a few years, I knew JDBC and Swing pretty well,  a little of the EJB stuff, there were whole vast swathes of the Java universe that were simply out of scope. I got out of Java a few years ago, but I imagine it must be even more so now. With my current main languages, Python and OCaml, I still feel as if I've barely scratched the surface (and in the company I count as an ""expert"").<p>But this isn't limited to languages, back then a DBA could know all of Oracle 7.3.4, now Oracle 11g is too big for any one person to know it all. There's no such thing as a generalist DBA anymore. You know enough to operate anything your organization uses day to day or fix it if it breaks in the middle of the night, but a tricky problem outside your specialist area will need to wait 'til whoever in the company specializes in that can take a look the next day.",1252762188

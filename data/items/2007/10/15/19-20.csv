America is drawing nearer and nearer to the situation you describe.

You can already label comment as ""funny"",""interesting"", or whatever, but you can't filter by those labels.  I want to be able to read at a threshold of 3+ and not funny.",1192477965

Tesla worked night and day to redesign them and gave the Edison company several profitable new patents in the process. During the year of 1885, when Tesla inquired about the payment on the work, Edison replied to him, ""Tesla, you don't understand our American humor,"" and reneged on his promise.""",1192477954

68177,comment,68075,68075,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Great write-up of your experience!  It's particularly interesting that you moved away from Java/GWT to RoR.  Did you find handrolling your own javascript (+ frameworks) to be just as productive as the Java/GWT approach?  (My RoR app has most of the funky javascript GUI after authorization, so it's not indexable anyway.)   <p>Some other questions:<p>- When do you plan on releasing your git bundle for TextMate? :)<p>- Has there been any gotchas when using Joyent's Sun platform?<p>- Did you consider using extjs?

I think that scribd is bound to get blocked by school and work firewalls and other services leading to the site being less useful for the general population. I would propose they create something like adult.scribd.com (or an entire different domain name) that can be easily filtered and enforce that all adult content must be posted accessed from this URL (where they can add age verification if needed).

68174,comment,68069,68124,0,0,alex_c,,,"I care what the motivations are.<p>A person with a strong but controversial opinion will stick to and defend their point of view throughout the debate.  The end result might be that I now understand a new point of view, or that they alter their point of view.<p>A troll will duck and weave, change topics and backtrack.  The goal isn't to express an opinion they believe in, but to annoy people and get responses.  The end result is that I waste my time reading their posts, since they're not going anywhere with it.<p>Sometimes you can only tell the difference after the dust settles.  I'm still trying to make up my mind about this thread ;)",1192477308

68170,comment,68069,68069,0,0,geebee,,,"You and  have different opinions about how to define a troll.  A strong opinion, forecefully presented on a controverial topic obviously does not make someone a troll.  I would identify a troll through a combination of personal disrespect and off-topic commentary.<p>Here's an example that shows up now and then:<p>Orig Post:  ""I'm trying to decide if I should locate my startup in silicon vally or in san francisco.  I'd like to be near my potential buyers, which would mean locating in the valley.  But I think my developers would be happier living in the city.""<p>Here are two strong responses, one legit, and one from a troll:<p>Non-Troll: ""San Francisco isn't as much fun as people make it out to be.  I don't think it would help you attract developers at all.  I'd much rather be in the valley where the action is.""<p>Troll:  ""The city?  San Francisco isn't a city.  New York, now that's a city...""<p>Both of these posts are clearly going to attract some argumentative responses.  The first may goad a few people, but it is on-topic, contains something that can be defended or refuted under the terms of the original debate, and continues the discussion.  The second tries to provoke the thread into something kind of stupid and off-topic.<p>Argumentative people can further debate, but Trolls always degrade a discussion until there is no longer anything substantive.<p>I hope for the best for this discussion forum.  Craigslist is essentially unusable because of the trolling, but hackernews is still pretty great.  <p>Will hackernews be like that chilly bar you found that got overrun by jackasses six months later, forcing you to look for a new spot?  Man, I hope not, because this is a good site.  ",1192476733

Most of their machines are crazy expensive so in order for them to have a long active life they have satellite monitoring of machine conditions on site (oil samples, temperature, etc).

Wikipedia has largely replaced it, at least in my experience.<p>Considering they raised $120 million in VC, is a $250 million acquistion a major success?  The founders are probably rich now, but for the investors, it doesn't seem much better than breaking even (especially since the site is ten years old).  What did they need $120 million for, anyway?",1192476348
68165,comment,68001,68099,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"While it's cute to make a witty retort such as that, it's such a cheap shot. When your grandparents are dragged out of their homes in the middle of the night, when your brothers and sisters are jailed for simply showing up at a big crowd, when your family's estate is taken without any questions or answers, when you don't have enough money to buy your way out of a citation and you get lost in the jail system, when all that happens at the whim of a Communist party, you can then come back and draw parallels. \n",1192476231

It's not surprising that it would be hard to get a programmer up to speed on such things.<p>My employer is looking for someone who would enjoy doing Schemey work in a Java environment, solving not-so-difficult problems.  It wasn't hard to find someone last time around, and I don't think it will be hard this time around once we fix the job description, which is poorly-written and factually incorrect.",1192475832

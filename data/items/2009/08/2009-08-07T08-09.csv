747281,comment,746807,746807,0,0,krying_krab,,,"Perhaps what most interests me about the article is not the dichotomy of the two cultures, but in the area between them.<p>I'm a college sophomore studying EE in a notable university, but I spent most of my free time (and much of my homework time!) coding in high school. I had been using Linux from middle school, so my way of learning coding was picking up K&R's C book, learning the ropes, and starting to code on Linux. Linux really was an incredible atmosphere to learn to code in, and I learned more than just C. The ability to look at the source of other applications, to submit bugfixes for projects, and the incredible POSIX standard that makes C and other languages just ... whistle ... was great.<p>That said, I later abandoned Linux (several reasons: time, laptop incompatibility, much more time spent fiddling with radios, I ""sold out"", whatever) for day-to-day use. I still code and do it on Windows, but it's not the same. Now there are a lot of things of the ""Windows culture"" that I really like -- a shiny GUI for everyone, a huge smattering of applications which means that if I don't want to write it I don't have to, not having to deal with finding obscure driver patches so that my out-of-date hardware can stay supported, package management clashes, etc. But when I want to code, and I do so intermittently, I feel the intellectual gap.<p>I want that great POSIX interface, but more importantly I want an atmosphere that works around the code that I write. And here's where I feel the gap the most -- what about those of us who really enjoy a satisfying, intellectual coding experience, the ""Unix culture"" (and I don't code often enough to want to want to grind out consumer software), but still want the benefits felt for other users of the OS somewhat appreciably, and still want this end-user directed drag-and-drop ""Windows culture"".<p>I've heard that the Mac bridges the gap, but I'm an impoverished student, and spending $1000 on a Mac laptop is something in my semi-distant future.",1249633739

747264,comment,746873,746873,0,0,ardit33,,,"After reading it twice, there are many points that are good, but there also some points that are not so clear cut, or plain bad.  Maybe I am a bad programmer, but I disagree with some points:<p># (OOP) Writing lots of ""xxxxxManager"" classes that contain all of the methods for manipulating the fields of objects that have little or no methods of their own<p>I guess they keyword 'lots' make this ok, but having plain objects (scruct like), passed around in the application, and having some managers is fine.  eg. if you have an application that passes around contacts,  you can have a ContactsManager, taking care of all the messy bussines (local peristence, remote persitence, deleting, etc., while contacts remain simple objects.   ActiveRecord pattern goes the other way, where this logic is placed in the objects.  Both are fine.<p># (Relational) Treating a relational database as an object store and performing all joins and relation enforcement in client code<p>--I guess all those programmers in the ""NOSql"" movements are idiots.  (they are not, some of these people are really smart).  Don't take this statement too seriously.<p># Re-inventing or laboring without basic mechanisms that are built-into the language, such as events-and-handlers or regular expressions<p>--I think regular expressions are evil, obscure, and performance is highly depended on the implementation.  Practical example, checking if an email address is valid.  While some people go all the way crazy with regular expression, All I do is check that there is an '@', or a '+', at least one '.', and minimum/maximum lengths.  You don't regular expressions for that, as no matter how smart you think your expression is, there is a great chance somebody that edits it will fuck it up just by changing a character on it.<p># Re-inventing classes and functions that are built-into the framework (eg: timers, collections, sorting and searching algorithms) *<p>Done many times.  If you are doing mobile, most of platform implementation (at least in J2ME) just suck ass. You can't rely on them.  Heck, in my previous company we did even font rendering, thread worker queues, etc.  as the scheduler was unreliable, etc.<p>#Recursive subroutines that concatenate/sum to a global variable or a carry-along output variable<p>--For some problems carry-along variable are needed.<p>eg, in a binary search tree, trying to print only the nodes in a certain level.
printTreeLevel(tree, 2)  -- will print only the nodes at level two<p>print(node, level)<p><pre><code>  if level == 0

# Writing business-logic functions with tragically compromising side-effects, such as updating a user interface or performing file I/O<p>--I guess it depends on the definition of what ""business-logic"" is.  This guy thinks it more as the transactional/model part and not a controller.  
For some apps, the business logic is the main controller.

747260,comment,747030,747030,0,0,Fixnum,,,"This post is interesting but hard to take too seriously.  First, I don't understand the author's hostility to the idea of graduates taking courses.  Grad courses supply general knowledge not acquired in undergrad and in-depth knowledge to prepare the student for research.  There are reasons why these courses follow the format they do - certain disciplines are best learned by an approach closer to 'lecture than to 'project (Real analysis? Lambda calculus?).  The author claims: ""You pick up all that needed stuff by doing real work. When you find a gap in your knowledge, you fix it. The instructor might give you an exercise to help you fix it.""  But this is not always feasible in abstract disciplines - try to pick up real analysis in this way, and you'll probably end up doing a lot of proofs that look very much like the standard real analysis sequence but seem a lot more frustrating.  This isn't to say we need to sit in classrooms for six hours a week, but teaching certain subjects (but not all) via projects is a waste of time.<p>The call for 2-week sessions instead of semesters seems to be based -- like several other suggestions -- on the peculiar preferences of the author rather than on sound argument.<p>It's easy to come up with one's own wish list of how graduate school should operate, and the author is rightfully cautious about the implementation.  But it seems to me the problems raised aren't fundamental to graduate school.  Maybe the classroom lecture is becoming obsolete; it arguably helps demoralize students by removing from them responsibility for their own edification.  But this doesn't demand top-down reform of everything but the thesis.<p>We should save that for the undergrad programs.",1249632846

Some of those other human beings may not have had the time to catch up on the latest/greatest language feature or 'trick' and may miss subtleties of your implementation.<p>I get worried when I see someone take a mainstream language (C#, Java, Python) and try and twist its idioms into whatever their favorite language is (lisp, the ML family, Perl, etc). Or if someone wants to be on the bleeding edge and use the latest language syntax/library trick. This is a pain because<p>- Someone new to the codebase may not have as much familiarity with all these nuances of the language. For example, I've seen crazy things done with C++ templates. I don't think there was ever a justifiable reason for doing any of them.<p>- The esoteric, cutting edge features often have bugs and/or don't have great tool support. Fact of life is that the more some feature gets used, the more the bugs found and fixed.

Often, the only thing you have after a weird bug is a crash dump and caffeine. You want to give yourself all the chances you can of tracking down that issue.

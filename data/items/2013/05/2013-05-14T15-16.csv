If you're interested in starting a business, don't feel any rush to do it immediately, but your twenties are a great time to try it.<p>But don't get trapped working for a startup and kidding yourself that their success is your success.

5705776,comment,5704860,5704860,53,0,patio11,,,"Can I refocus this conversation away from you and Weebly?  Both for avoidance of personalizing this and to avoid this turning on the specifics of this post and their copy, because the takeaway message for most people reading this is ""Should we implement lifecycle emails or not?"" rather than ""What exact words should I use?"" or ""What frequency is appropriate for a zero engagement user?""<p>Bob started using software from FooCorp.  Bob, for whatever reason, was not a great fit for FooCorp, and as a consequence has zero engagement.  FooCorp is unable to examine the inside of Bob's head, and must make predictions on Bob's behavior based on their model of his decisionmaking processes as informed by their experience with numerous similarly situated customers.<p>FooCorp made numerous attempts to improve their business relationship with Bob, despite the risk of annoying Bob.  They can justify this by pointing to observable evidence that, if they mail 100 Bobs, statistically Bobs actually do start using the FooSoft, and (anecdotally) their customer support team gets emails and blog posts saying ""Thanks for being so attentive to my needs!!1""  This is actually not shocking to FooCorp, because FooCorp has years of experience with onboarding customers onto FooSoft, and they have talked to <i>hundreds</i> of people who, when asked ""Why did you not finish using FooSoft?"", responded ""I got busy. / I forgot about it. / I didn't do that.  Wait, I did that?  Wow.  Um, hold on, I want to log in right now and fix that.  No seriously.  That was something I was going to do.""<p>Also, when you get down to brass tacks, if Bob has zero engagement with the product, Bob will not pay for the product, and thus the downside risk of annoying Bob is to a first approximation zero.  Bob might, because it is 2013, feel that Bob's opinion of FooCorp is very important to FooCorp even if Bob is not a paying customer, because social media and branding and word of mouth.  Bob may not run a software company, but if Bob were to hypothetically talk to people who did, Bob might hear it is difficult to pay engineering salaries with word of mouth but monthly recurring subscription revenues do not have this downside.  Thus a speculative hit to word of mouth does not weight very persuasively against a demonstrable massive increase in recurring subscription revenues.",1368547172

Liberalism in its purest form (as espoused by Hayek, say) is, in effect, free market capitalism with a light but universally applicable (no ""special cases"", as those lead to totalitarianism) set of regulations to prevent bad actors (e.g. hey, let's put heroin in baby formula so it's really more-ish).<p>There's this odd commingling of the concepts of socialism and liberalism in the general populace's minds, for some reason. The two could not be more antithetical.<p>As to the rest of it - the US is neither capitalist nor liberal. It's corporatist, with a distinct socialist bent, but not where people usually point the finger. ""Obamacare"" is not socialist, it's liberal, as a core concept of liberalism is that the state should fund things that people cannot or will not fund for themselves, like roads and healthcare. Protectionist policies to keep the banks, agribusinesses and other without-legislation-to-protect them unprofitable enterprises ARE socialist, as they centralise control of industrial and economic output into government, and allow businesses that would not survive in a true free market to prosper.<p>Rant over.",1368546999

Ever since I was a kid I was interested in video games and would like to try my hand at game development. I work with code professionally, but I have no experience with graphics or physics engines beyond what I have read on HackerNews, Twitter, research papers / conferences, etc. Beyond a gaming project in undergrad, I have never  created a game before (we coded this project in C++ using SDL, following the tutorials on LazyFoo).<p>I am a cerebral person and sometimes need to push myself to 'jump in' to the creative process; I have an art and music background and want to create my own sprites and music, and imagine the android platform is a great place to start developing.<p>Can anyone on Hackernews help me get started? Would anyone be willing to walk me through the basics or direct me to good blogs / resources for getting started? Anyone in my position and want to collaborate?<p>I have some specific questions too. Take your favorite Android game. Anyone know the high-level overview for how it was coded?

I disagree.<p>Here's (more or less) the simplest possible random model of the primes. (It's called the Cramer model.) Take P to be a random subset of the natural numbers that includes each n>1 independently with probability 1/log(n). Then P is kinda like the prime numbers, though it lacks some structure it should have (e.g., it doesn't have the property that almost all elements are odd).<p>If you do this, then the expected number of ways to write a large n as the sum of two elements of P is on the order of n/log(n)^2, which is far enough from 0 that I bet (though I haven't checked) that Pr(every number >= 4 is the sum of two elements of P) is positive, and in fact probably quite big. This is kinda analogous to the Goldbach conjecture; note that it isn't only about even n, since in this model there can be lots of even ""prime numbers"".<p>I did a quick computer experiment, and it looks as if the probability is about 20%. In other words, if the primes were chosen at random according to the Cramer model, then about 1/5 of the time the appropriately mangled Goldbach conjecture would be true. (And the ""odd Goldbach conjecture"", which is what Helfgott has just proved, would be true substantially more often than that.)<p>Now, of course the Cramer model is way too simple. In particular, it doesn't know that almost all prime numbers are odd. So let's make it just a little smarter by declaring that 2 is always in P, the other elements of P are always odd, and that any odd n>1 is in P with probability 2/log(n). And now we should switch back to the original form of the Goldbach conjecture, looking only at even n. Well, according to my computer experiment the probability that the Goldbach conjecture holds if we use P instead of the primes is about 96%!<p>[EDITED to add: and if we force P to get 2 and 3 ""right"" instead of just 2, the probability goes up to about 99.5%. I fixed a few other things in this edit too.]<p>In other words: <i>if the primes are basically random, then we should expect the Goldbach conjecture to be true</i>.",1368544195

You can do cheap, and reasonable, or you can get a huge range of very advanced products that are starting to look very attractive in terms of design and build quality too.<p>In between there's a large mid range where quality is rapidly improving but the prices stay low.<p>I got a Star B92M phone, for example. It's a cheap Galaxy S3 clone (same exact dimensions; comes with the same dandelion screensaver; some distributors offers it with a fake Samsung logo....). It's slower. It feels cheaper (the plastic back, for example is a noticeable weakness, and the GPS is a known problem - needs longer antennae). But it's got 1GB RAM, can take 64GB sd card, same 1280x720 resolution, higher resolution (12MP) main camera, dual sims, and generally acts and feels like a relatively high end phone with some minor caveats (try to run 3d stuff, and it's about the same performance as the much older HTC Desire HD, for example, though the Desire HD was much higher end when it was released and the Star trounces it overall performance). I'll stick to that cost range phone because it pays for itself vis-a-vis contract costs for a top end phone in ~6-8 months, and I'm good at breaking stuff...<p>Now the bar has been raised substantially higher, and there are 1800+ listings for phones with 1920x1080 resolution (in the 5"" size range; lots of duplicates of the same models from multiple sellers, though), many of them quad core MTK based phones with 2GB RAM that are now at the very least up around the top of the mid-range segment if not outright challenging the most powerful high end phones yet.<p>In terms of innovation, you'll start seeing more of it once more of their manufacturers are pushing up against the ceiling set by the current pack leaders like Samsung and Apple. For now they are still busy playing catch-up in most respects.<p>To some extent we are also seeing different priorities that hides some of the features that these manufacturers put effort into. E.g. dual-sims seems to be pretty much a requirement for mid-range phones and above from the Chinese manufacturers, while  you see it relatively rarely in models that are features heavily in the West. You even see 3 and 4 sim phones. A lot of these features  may simply not make it to the West to any great extent because they're not what consumers here care about (but I'm in love with having dual sims - being able to slot in a second sim with cheap data etc. when travelling abroad while still being able to take calls on my standard number is great).",1368543786

What's the difference between 7 minutes of this and 7 minutes of sitting, reading HN or Reddit?  Lots.<p>I did this one yesterday, just to try it out. Now me, personally, I'm quite active. I did it three times with 30-second stretch breaks because that's what it took to work up a good sweat.<p>The point of exercise like this, to my mind, is that you can do it anytime and work it into your work day. Exercise during the work day, even minimal exercise sharpens your concentration and ""shakes out the dead leaves"" so to speak. It makes you sharper, and sharper at 3:30 in the afternoon (empirically determined to be the least productive time of the day by several studies) is exactly what most of us need.<p>What are your goals when you work out?  Depending on that, this is not a waste of time.  If you want to lose 50lbs, this will not help you.  If you want massive muscles, this will not help you.  If you want to be an ""active person"", this will not by itself achieve that, although it may make it easier to <i>get into</i> exercise later, when you do something short and see nearly immediate results.  It's rewarding, and that's the first thing you need when starting an exercise program of any sort.<p>My point is, don't let anyone -- or yourself -- shame you out of working out. Yes, you read it in the NYT. It's a fad and it's mass-media.  That doesn't make it stupid by definition.  If it starts you off on finding ways to hack your body and make it strong, endurant, and resilient, then by all means, <i>go for it</i>.",1368543642

It was great exercise and I loved how strong I was after a few years of doing that religiously.<p>At some point life ""got in the way"", and between a kid and a full-time job my gym time started to disappear. I've tried a lot of creative approaches to keeping fit with shorter workouts, and what I have come up with isn't all that different than what is being prescribed here.<p>My basic approach is this:<p>1. Pushups - every other morning I do 5 minutes of pushups where I start at a set of 20 then bump up by a count of 5 until I'm at 35. Then I work my way back down to 20 allowing brief 20 second rests in between.<p>2. Pullups - same as pushups except I start at 6 and bump by 2 until I hit 10, and then work back down.<p>3. Squats - No weight, three sets of 50. This could be better, but I'm kinda lazy when it comes to squats<p>4. Mix in exercises using resistance bands. (shoulder press, lat pulls, tricep extensions, etc). I usually do these in three sets of 12-15.<p>Each workout takes about 15 minutes, and while I've lost some muscle mass I'm still a pretty lean/muscular 170. I'm sure there are all sorts of optimizations I could make, but honestly I don't really care at this point. I've found a quick workout I can do 3-4 times a week and it is keeping me pretty damn healthy.",1368543635

Good luck catching up with a pay product.",1189940067

Frankly, the only reason I still use it is because I've invested time into it, and simply don't have time to go back to working with something else that actually has features I need.  I end up having to do so much by hand it's annoying.<p>And not everything I want is a feature.  The system is bug-ridden and doesn't work.  I mean, how is it possible that you enter information into a form, and the resulting error message doesn't even show.  So I email support, and the result is ""Oh, well, you need this information.""  Apparently, if you know just the first name of a contact and don't happen to have the last name, you have to enter something in.<p>1. Would be nice to actually know that without having to email support.\n2. Why not? Seems completely retarded to require something that is unimportant to the grand scheme of things.<p>So yeah, adding in these simple features would go a long way.<p>As for some of the bigger features, again, it makes the application difficult to use.  Seriously, if those products are the foundation, the poster children of good quality online programming, shit, I'm light years ahead of them.",1189939343

And so the spam flood will begin.",1189939285

55230,comment,54977,55007,0,0,mojuba,,,"Since Jottit doesn't link to its users' pages, their rank in the beginning is 0, and so is their attractiveness for spammers. Once Jottit builds a catalogue of user pages, it's dead.",1189938444
55229,comment,54977,55120,0,0,mojuba,,,"The same way as GMail and other large email providers. From my experience with GMail, its accuracy is near 100% and their heuristics is mostly based on statistical data, e.g. they probably detect large volumes of mail coming from one IP and having similar links, etc.",1189937478
55228,comment,54827,54966,0,0,felipe,,,"The problem is that David is not Linus nor PG, so that sounds awfully arrogant coming from him.<p>The other problem is that David's ideas are not really ""his ideas"". He simply recycled XP and Agile concepts from the 90s. I for one prefer to read the originals (Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, Ron Jeffries, etc...)",1189937380
55227,comment,54834,55115,0,0,uuilly,,,"You're probably right.  By definition we take ourselves too seriously.  But I think what you're seeing has been a long time coming.  The Rand Zealots in the tech world have been lurking in the corners of Slashdot, Digg and Reddit listening to a cacophony of post modern, no up or down, no left or right emotional bullshit.  I for one am sick of armchair socialists, open source evangalists and peddlers of western guilt.  We like our one's and zeros but there is a lot we have to put up with to hang.  I think this thread has released the Ayn Rand hounds.  <p>Political disagreements stem from philosophical disagreements.  If two mathematicians were arguing about geometry and one assumed that parallel lines never met and the other assumed they did they would not have a meaningful conversation.  The problem with most conversations is they mostly deal with surface issues.  Clinton or Obama.  Bush or Kerry.  Blah or Bleh.  <p>Amen to Hacker news for getting to the heart of the matter.  And to the the non-Rand-ers, apologies for our intensity and contrarian views.  But this conversation will be good for everyone...",1189936888

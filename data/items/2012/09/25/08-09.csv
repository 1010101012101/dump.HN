I know the Passphrase FAQ says using another language doesn't make your passphrase harder to guess[0], but having worked a bit with language tech, I'm pretty sure that's only true under certain ""ideal conditions"". Most lang. tech is extremely English-focused, if there's a new development, it always happens with English first. In non-English languages, OTOH, it can be a challenge simply to find a good dictionary, and finding the corpora to do the kind of rating done by lsb's algorithm is even harder.<p>Of course, if the ""other language"" is French/German/Spanish, sure, it's probably not much safer. But if you're lucky enough to know a more marginalised language, I'd say go with it.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.iusmentis.com/security/passphrasefaq/practical/#WhatifIuseanotherlanguage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iusmentis.com/security/passphrasefaq/practical/#W...</a>",1348563498

Just think about how all disruptive innovations come to be. They are awesome and game-changing from a certain point of view (free charging/""gas""!) but can also have some big downsides (30 minute charging, only half a charge - at first).<p>But the part you should be focusing on is the first one, the positive one. Because that will change everything and to some people, the second part, the negative one, will be irrelevant just long enough for Tesla to work on improving it and years later making it ""good enough"" for most people.<p>Remember how the iPhone was awesome at user interface and interaction? But sucked at battery life (compared to other smartphones), had only a 2 MP camera, no video recording, only 2G connection and no MMS? That may not have been good enough for 90% of Nokia or Blackberry users back then, but the iPhone is good enough for almost everyone today, and the iPhone changed the entire industry. That's how disruptive innovations work, and I believe that's exactly how Tesla's new model will work.<p>Also, do you know how everyone says I wish I would've bought Apple stock when the iPhone first appeared? Well, if I was into stock, I'd probably start buying Tesla stock just about now.",1348563458

That thing in the console of most cars is already anything but mission critical.<p>They want to replace the entertainment (including the navigation) software, nothing more. Android should be capable of doing that just fine and might bring some life into a rather dull field.. These systems have so many flaws and limitations that make them look like they're from the 90s (based on my experience with brand new Audi, BMW and VW [1] cars in the last 3-5 years). These systems easily set you back for more than 1000 EUR (usually far more) and are limited in terms of supported filesystems (like 2GB limits on SD cards), numbers of files or folders (truncating your playlist) and just .. so .. slow..<p>I'd love any 'mainstream' component that is integrated into the car, running on hardware that isn't far worse than my phone.<p>1: References: Had an A3 with ~every option~ as a company car in 2007, a VM Golf GTD with ~every option~ in 2010 and rented a lot of decently sized BMWs when travelling.",1348563445

However, for maximum performance, you need a good compiler, which understands and optimizes your abstractions. In the case of Lisp, whoever writes the macros is also responsible for optimizing them. Unfortunately, this requires application programmers to be also good in writing compilers.<p>C++ certainly has deficiencies, which cannot be fixed without completely breaking backwards compatibility. Rob Pike probably has them all included in the list you linked to. E.g. irregular syntax and header files.<p>In my opinion D has mostly fixed those conceptual issues. Unfortunately, D is not mature [0] and development is slow. While D is certainly not the final word in language design, I consider it the only serious competitor to C++.<p>[0] <a href=""http://3d.benjamin-thaut.de/?p=20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3d.benjamin-thaut.de/?p=20</a>",1348562857

I didn't double-major in CS or anything, but kept programming and IT stuff as a hobby, contributed to Open Source projects, helped with IT-related problems at university and generally tried to learn something new all the time (The recent surge in online classes like Coursera and Udacity has helped a lot). Now I'm fully employed, directly from University, as a software developer.<p>Is/was my degree useless? No way. Those 4 years of studying history and doing lots of research (I think I wrote around 15 papers in those years, around 70% of which were on subjects with little previous research done before) have taught me to choose my sources wisely, to reflect on my own thinking critically (this is a prime asset as a historian, you cannot uncritically let your own preconceptions of the world direct your decisions) and to generally try to see things (and especially abstractions and thought-systems) from as many different sides as possible. All great skills to have if you code for a living.<p>I might not be as well versed in theoretical computer science as a CS graduate from a good(!) program, but I am familiar enough with the territory that I can pick up new areas/technologies/algorithms rather quickly and it prevents me from getting the ""I graduated in CS, I know everything and do not have to make any effort any more""-attitude that I've e.g. seen in my predecessor at the current job I have (he used unsalted md5-hashes for passwords, wrote Java classes that are >10k lines long and used a mix of zip-archives of his Eclipse-workbench and hundreds of commented-out LOCs as a form of version control)",1348562536

Second, this is a false and misleading comparison.<p>What started the original ""best viewed with"" problems of the 90s? It was largely due to the lack of compliance with standardization. Every browser had its own buggy way to render content, often slightly different from the equally buggy ways that the competition rendered content. Most web devs at the time were undisciplined and lazy and they tended to use a standard reference browser as a guide for creating their layouts. This led to the insanity of sites that looked fine in one browser but were broken in others, typically due to accidentally making use of rendering bugs.<p>Now things are completely different. Standards compliant rendering is the norm for all of the most popular browsers. The issue today isn't basic compatibility as it was in the 90s it is now features. In order to push the state of the art in terms of new features on the web it will be necessary for some sites to remind their users that not every browser supports the features their site is built on.",1348562528

Instead they must expose only the bare minimum OS low-level APIs (TCP, UDP, POSIX), keeping the surface area as small and powerful and direct as possible, and then let open source grow around this. Innovation needs to be decentralized, bottom-up. Not designed by committee.<p>For that to happen, we need to stop conflating ""web apps"" (trusted, installed, annointed with machine power) with ""web pages"" (accessed by single link click). At present, Web Apps are suffering and crippled by being lumped under the same security policy as web pages. But Web Apps need to have access to raw machine resources in the same way that Native Apps have access.<p>Those that don't seem to care for any of this insistence, tend also to be naive as to the massive differences between TCP and WebSockets, and IP and TCP and the whole stack in general.

I know that there are many tens of other reasons why it would make good sense to keep CL content CL-exclusive.<p>Of course, I realize that this must be tempered with the realization that there are situations where scraping CL and re-posting the information on another site may make sense for the original poster (e.g., a hotel ad).<p>Here are a few of the negative items that come to mind for just classified ads:<p>- When I complete a transaction and delete a CL ad, I do not want other interested parties calling, texting and e-mailing me hours, months or years afterwards<p>- I already dislike the 10-to-1-ish ratio of SPAM/scammer/nutjob banter to communications from legitimately interested parties. I suspect any proliferation of my postings beyond CL will only tend to increase this ratio.<p>- The text and images within my classified ads may be more easily accessible to scammers who just need some content to farm and post elsewhere (e.g., other classified forums, eBay, AirBnB, etc.)<p>- Sites which do the automated scraping of CL can directly be or can become a target and/or searchable repository for intelligence gathering and source for creating new or expanding existing personal identification databases<p>There are countless other scenarios ranging from good to bad regarding this subject. For now, I'm convinced that the potential for the bad, the incompetent, the annoying, the negligent, the criminal and other negative scenarios outweigh the good. This is really meant to apply to how I use CL. As I mentioned before, there are undoubtedly specific scenarios where many of the potentially negative items would be moot for specific CL users.<p>Obviously, there are other factors here too such as the commercial viability/legality/precedent of allowing non-CL entities to use CL resources with or without restriction to directly or indirectly profit. From my perspective as a user, it's not really that important other than an arguable matter of principle.",1348562022

I may even get an explanatory message for free if the exception came with a message.<p>For me, having exceptions over return codes has a number of advantages:<p>* Within a single object, you get much more information (error message and stack trace). You need to return two different values if you need both a message and a return code<p>* You don't want to handle the exception at the call site? no problem, just propagate it up the stack. On the other hand, if you want to try the same thing with return codes, you need a way to differentiate the return codes due an error in your migrate() function and the error codes resulting from a given callSql statement.<p>* Which brings us to... another benefit: enforced compile-time checking of the exception. You can't write code that is going to check for a DogException when the callee throws a CatException. But it's very easy to check for -1 when the actual code is -2. Of course you can alleviate this somewhat using static constants, but it's still a safety issue.<p>Obviously, exceptions are not all roses either, whenever you need a new one, you need to create a class for it. But the workflow interruption is not greater by an order of magnitude than adding a static constant somewhere to represent your new error code.<p>Edited for better formatting.",1348561832

There are a number of benefits using Android like this, least of all you can take advantage of the hardware expertise that already exists for building Android backed devices, and leverage the larger amount of software talent available.<p>Of course, there are problems. All these embedded systems have very long shelf lives, much longer than a typical handset. A IFE unit in a plane might be expected to last 15 years <i>at least</i>, a car is hopefully going to spend a decade or more on the road. The hardware is not going to be upgraded - don't expect updates to later Android versions.<p>This presents problems for third-party development, assuming manufacturers offer it. Ideally, you'd hope for a manufacturer supplied SDK that offered you easily consumable information and telemetrics (vehicle speed, fuel level, etc) and an open app store. Car companies may not see an advantage to offering it at this time.<p>So really, the challenge isn't to convince car manufacturers to use Android: most are almost certainly already considering it for their high-end models.

If you look at the CleanIT website, you can see that this is just a project by the ""Law Enforcement or Counter terrorism departments"" of some European Countries. The project explicitly states that it has a ""Non-legislative approach"" and is seen as a ""Public-Private-Partnership"".<p>The only connection to the EU is that it received an EU financing in 2011. Clearly the content of the document is really troubling, but what would you expect from a document exclusively edited by some governments anti-terror departments? This reads more like a wishlist than anything having a remote chance of political survival.<p>Anyway there will be enough time to start worrying and outrage if these ideas actually appear in a legislative proposal by the EU commission. Even then it would likely take another 3-4 years to become law. Keep in mind that the current EU commission is only in place until the next EU elecions in 2014. It is very unlikely that a huge legislative project would be initiated before that.",1348560915

Add having to constantly frob a binding from ""anySymbol"" to ""_"" while doing some instrumentation or whatever.  This kind of trivia should be fixable by a program, and otherwise let it remain a warning.  I think the occassional positioning of this inconvenience as a feature is unconvincing.<p>Annoyance at the lack of assertions.  I think the concern given by the Go FAQ can be met even without making everyone roll their own assertion construct, but now we have either fewer assertions or a less idiomatic way of identifying them.  I think an assertion is quite distinct from an error in that it should indicate a logically impossible condition rather than an unusual one, and I often see this guideline applied in the world at large.  As such, I feel the FAQ seems flimsy in its justification, and now I have panics littered about that have a convention indicating their special nature.<p>Assertions are also one of the very few pieces of software engineering practice that have even a smidgen of empirical evidence in their support as well: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=70290"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=7029...</a><p>Leakiness of semicolon insertion.  The abstractions <i>are</i> leaky, but I like not having to type my semicolons and it's not a common mistake I make.  Minor.<p>Lack of clarity with regard to unicode.  Yes, the language supports it quite well (as he mentions, unsurprising given its pedigree), but I'd say the type system and operators available only seem so-so, and it seems like more so than with Java or Python3 leaky abstractions between bytes and encoded text are present.  Among my favorites:<p><a href=""http://golang.org/src/pkg/text/scanner/scanner.go#L521"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/src/pkg/text/scanner/scanner.go#L521</a><p>Wherein the ""rune"" returned by the ""text/scanner"" ""Scan()"" is used to identify the type of token rather than its value. Sometimes.  I was mystified by the type signature for a while (why is this returning a rune, and not a lexeme or lex type?) and had to read the package to convince myself that was the intent.  Plus side: this kind of abstraction leakage (or at least free-wheeling coercion) can probably yield much faster code.<p>Disagreements:<p>""Violation space in time"", whereby the semantics of a statement can be varied by the arity of the binding.  I think this is good, and not bad.  It's only a little weird that it's only available (afaik) as a special service to channel binding rather than any operator defined by a user.<p>Buffered Channels and Deadlocks: non-deterministic deadlocks are a pain, and I don't think Go provides any real treatment  (or exacerbation) of this problem, however, it probably could make that possible by adding some operators to enable writing a run-time deadlock detector, which can be useful for some programs.<p>Notable omissions, speaking in the postive:<p>I think go fmt is great.  I don't like everything about the formatting, but I like the slavery-is-freedom approach there.<p>The gdb support is surprisingly good and neatly integrated into most new gdbs one gets off the shelf.

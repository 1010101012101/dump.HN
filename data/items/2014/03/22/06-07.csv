But I do work with AI, using different approaches and techniques. /disclaimer<p>My view of AI is that it is as complex as it is fascinating. It might seem easy to just download an artificial neural network library, feed data to it and then see what it spits back, but what data should you feed it? And you want it learn? Or should you use a genetic algorithm instead of neural networks?<p>Those seem like easy questions to answer with a handful of math formulas, but the formulas will help you more on giving  you a firmer assessment on the scope of the solution space, how to measure if it is really progressing, when the AI is in learning plateaus, etc.<p>But the big reward is in how to creatively use AI. By &quot;seeing&quot; data in a new way you can ask different questions, and might get some interesting answers.<p>I&#x27;m telling you all this because my view on how and when to use AI evolves constantly to this days, and I&#x27;ve been working with it for about 7 years.<p>So start studying right now if you really like this field. Not only will the formal AI education become easier, but you will probably be able to get more from it if you get there with some experience.",1395471505

7448048,comment,7446530,7447105,17,0,DavidAdams,,,"(My startup helps companies navigate healthcare reform, so I&#x27;m a bit of an expert on this)<p>The key to your question are the terms &quot;guaranteed issue&quot; and &quot;age bracketing.&quot; I&#x27;m going to guess that you&#x27;re pretty young and at least at the time that you enrolled in your health insurance, you&#x27;d never had any health problems. They way that individual health insurance worked prior to 2014, insurance companies would offer extremely low rates to individuals, and keep their expenses down by refusing to insure anyone with even the most dubious &quot;pre-existing condition.&quot; So if you&#x27;d gone to the doctor complaining about a pain in your side, that would be considered a disqualifying event, and they&#x27;d turn you down. Or, much worse, you&#x27;d get the insurance, pay premiums for years, then if you ever developed cancer, they&#x27;d later comb through your health records, find where your doctor wrote down that you&#x27;d had a pain in your side, cite it as an undisclosed medical issue, and refuse to cover your cancer treatment.<p>Needless to say, that&#x27;s a very effective way of keeping the cost of coverage down: only insure healthy people who never go to the doctor. As you aged, the insurance company would start jacking up your rates to cover their increased exposure. If you ever developed an illness, you&#x27;d have no choice but to pay what they asked, because you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get insurance from another company since you now had a pre-existing condition.<p>Healthcare reform&#x27;s two boldest and most popular changes are guaranteed issue (health plans must accept you, regardless of pre-existing conditions) and outlawing &quot;recission,&quot; or retroactively searching for disqualifying health records to deny claims. So what that means is that insurance companies can&#x27;t cherry-pick the healthy people anymore, which means that the young, healthy minority is going to see higher prices for individual health plans.<p>Second, the ACA reduced the number of allowable age brackets, meaning that plans for the oldest people can only cost 3x what the youngest people pay. So that hits younger people again, since they have to be roped in with an older age contingent than before.<p>You may have heard Obamacare proponents worrying about getting enough young people into the risk pool so we don&#x27;t end up with &quot;adverse selection.&quot; They&#x27;re not worried about that just because young people are feckless and think they&#x27;re invincible. It&#x27;s also because they know that they&#x27;re the ones that are seeing the biggest rate hikes.  Of course, while someone like you have to pay $200/mo instead of $90, the flipside is that a family that used to be unable to afford $1500 per month and can now be insured for $250, and that seems like a decent tradeoff, especially since, in general, young people will eventually get older and have families themselves, and they&#x27;ll benefit from the changes.<p>The good news is that at least for the time being, you&#x27;ll still have cheaper insurance, until your insurance company starts with the shenanigans and starts jacking up your rates or discontinues that line (and blames it on Obamacare whether it&#x27;s true or not).<p>And by the way, if anyone out there is involved in a business that&#x27;s having a hard time with health benefits costs, my startup is taking advantages of lesser-known provisions of the new healthcare law to save companies a lot of money.

7447977,comment,7443420,7444959,3,0,rquantz,,,"<i>Most unspeakable thoughts today deal with isms and phobias: sexism, racism, agism, Islamophobia, homophobia.</i><p>PG suggested this as well with his references to &quot;racial insensitivity,&quot; etc. And he may be right that future generations may not worry too much about racial insensitivity. But that does not mean that trying to speak and write about race in a way that is sensitive to the problems that race presents is irrational or merely fashionable.<p>We live in a time of ongoing racial strife in America and around the world, and we come from times of even worse strife. Attempting to be racially sensitive is a rational response to the fact that, for centuries, we white western men have been extraordinarily racially <i>insensitive</i>.<p>Let&#x27;s look at an example of statements about race that would fall on different sides of that line. If I were to say that black men earn, on average, less money than white men, most people would say I was speaking factually. If I were to say that black men are, on average, less intelligent than white men, most people would say I was being racially insensitive -- or worse. In fact, one striking thing about many taboo or insensitive things that one could say today, is that they are frequently used as moral apologies for other, factual statements. Anyone arguing that black people are usually less intelligent than white people is probably also going to argue that black people <i>deserve</i> to make less money than white people. If it is taboo to say that urban gay men are more likely to contract HIV (in a moment I&#x27;ll argue that that is not the case), it would be because there could also be a whiff of a suggestion that therefore a gay man with HIV deserves to be sick.<p>Another striking thing about this variety of taboo statements today, as opposed to taboos of previous generations, is how frequently such taboo statements are factually inaccurate. In fact, calling &quot;black men are less intelligent than white men&quot; racially insensitive is possibly the most charitable thing one could say about that statement. When you see &quot;racially insensitive&quot; in print, that is usually because someone (a politician or celebrity) said something false and/or blatantly racist, but the publication felt it was too inflammatory to call it what it was -- false and racist.<p>Finally, as a rebuttal to your statement about HIV, if it&#x27;s taboo, why does a doctor ask me if I have sex with men the first time I meet her? Why are gay men still not allowed to donate blood? Context is what matters here. As a matter of fact, HIV is more prevalent in the gay community than the straight one (or at least it was -- feel free to offer newer data that refutes this). It is also more prevalent among African Americans. Stating these facts is not taboo, but suggesting that these fact hold any moral weight, that any of these groups that has faced ancient discrimination actually deserves it, is rightfully subject to distaste and rebuke given our cultural history.",1395469000

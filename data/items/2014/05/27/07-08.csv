Yes, a robotic mixer might work in a crappy bar for standard bar drinks like a Rum and Coke, Long Island Iced Tea, etc., but anything beyond the standard pour-and-serve is probably best done by the human touch, especially if you&#x27;re charging big city prices for them.<p>That said, there are some places that do use quick mixers to mix up the classics.   Garduños, a huge Albuquerque, NM mexican restaurant (as seen in Breaking Bad, season 5!) uses pre-mixed margarita mix from a keg and dispenses it with a typical bartender&#x27;s soda gun.  They&#x27;ve realized that most people who order &quot;well&quot; margaritas aren&#x27;t that discerning and appreciate the consistency that a factory-mixed &#x27;rita delivers.  Garduños serves them by the gallon and the pre-mix saves them lots of bartender time when they&#x27;re mixing their most popular cocktail.<p>This would never fly in a nice bar, though.  These days, most big city bars are chasing the money and the money is in &quot;craft cocktails&quot;.  It&#x27;s all about the ingredients and the customized drinks that are tailored to the customer&#x27;s preferences.  Bartenders are making a big show out of things like twisting a slice of orange peel to release its oils.  The presentation is hugely important here and a robotic mixer just doesn&#x27;t have the right vibe, in my opinion.",1401176954

As soon as you want to present the same information in several formats, or show headlines of articles in several places you need to abstract those things.

The abstract document model is really essential (and probably plain-text based).

Though it doesn&#x27;t bring any fancy new paradigm or language feature, it cherry picked a lot of useful and convenient parts of other languages, and combined it into a familiar, C-syntax statically typed, type-inferred language.<p>You can literally pick it up without reading any documentation if you&#x27;re familiar with C/C++, C# or Java, and the cross platform support is really good. They mostly use source-to-source compilation, but their implementations are really robust.<p>To top that off, they have an excellent cross platform library in OpenFL (previously NME) that is equally easy to pick up.",1401174369

I&#x27;m always amazed that his stuff was even considered in the 70s/80s.<p>By far the biggest misconception about GPS is that the GPS satellites somehow know where you are, or that your device transmits something to the satellite. I don&#x27;t think this article does a good job of making that clear. It&#x27;s kind of pandering to the paranoid. Granted, if you have a phone with a GPS receiver, it&#x27;s totally possible/probable that your location is being reported through some other means (like the cell network).",1401174140

If the compiler can produce near-JS performance I wish them and Dart developers well, otherwise using Dart will only handicap you in other browsers.

The high-level distinction should be WS vs. RPC vs. REST. WS is centred about the services, RPC is centred about the methods and REST is centred around the resources. HTTP is just a transport layer, the GET/POST style is a primitive way to implement each of these architectures. It is the input and output data that makes a GET/POST request fit in one of these three categories.<p>But what really bothers me is that, to my eyes, the author main point is that REST is marginal and people who still seriously talk about it are akin to those hunting unicorns. This is not explicitly said, but this is the feeling that this article left me with.<p>The description of REST says<p>> Originally, REST was synonymous with what is now called ""Hypermedia APIs."" However, after large amounts of misunderstanding, REST advocates are rebranding REST to ""Hypermedia APIs"" and leaving REST to the RESTish folks.<p>I have never heard an use of ""Hypermedia API"" as different from ""an API that user REST"". REST is an blueprint for building distributed architectures. When you build one that follows such blueprint you end up with an ""hypermedia API"".<p>People who misunderstand REST are actually using RPC+GET/POST. These kinds of mistakes are routinely pointed out; people will comment ""the API of XYZ is not RESTful at all! They are using _REST_ only because it is a cool term to use nowadays"". Not much different from how people misuse ""multimedia"", yet the meaning of multimedia is not going to change any time soon.<p>When talking about REST there is spectrum to take into account: there are APIs that fully adheres to the REST principles, other that adhere less, others that are basically redoing SOAP or RPC yet call themselves REST because it is cool. The same thing has happened with Agile programming. People use SVN, a code review every now and then, write two unit tests that cover 1% of the paths and they will says ""we are doing Agile development, like all the cool kids"".

The real thing you care about is P(test positive | have MDD), not P(have MDD | test positive).

3599875,comment,3598507,3599780,55,0,gecko,,,"I don't think that's quite true.  If you read stories in the New Yorker, or the Atlantic, or similar publications, then you'd find equally ""naval-gazing"" writing from ""real"" reporters.<p>When I write a post, or when a journalist writes a story, or when you write a comment, you want to have an angle: something that sets your writing apart from the other thirty people who are writing about the same thing.  Many publications today will cover detailed information about Mountain Lion.  Gruber knows that.  Further, there's not actually much new in Mountain Lion: Gruber successfully summarizes the new release in a handful of words in a middle paragraph.  While I suppose he could go into more detail on interface minutia between Contacts and Address Book, or pontificate on why Notification Center on OS X looks more like Growl and less like the iOS pull-down, even doing that would provide him relatively little material.<p>Instead, Gruber focused on the culture of the event.  From a company so well known for massive product releases and on-stage demos, the idea of doing not just one, but a large number of in-person demos across the country represents a substantial shift.  It could symbolize any number of things, from a lack of confidence to a desire to repair image damage from Foxconn, which is why Gruber finds a need to emphasize how polished the presentation was and how the event was set-up in detail.<p>I can understand why this might feel like naval gazing, but to me, it's anything but.  Gruber is in a unique position to comment on the cultural shifts of Apple, precisely because he's so involved with that selfsame culture.  If he's going to comment on Mountain Lion's release this morning, that's going to be his angle.  It's completely fine if you don't find it interesting, but questioning his competency, or calling this approach conceited, is wrong.",1329415405

One critique[2] of the PubMed Commons effort says that that is a step in the right direction, but includes too few researchers so far. A blog post on PubMed Commons[3] explains a rationale for limiting the number of scientists who can comment on previous research at first, until the system develops more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedcommons/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedcommons/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/pubmed-now-allows-comments-on-abstracts-but-only-by-a-select-few/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/pubmed-now-a...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/PubMedCommons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/PubMedCommons.html</a><p>USING MY EDIT WINDOW:<p>Some of the other comments mention studies with data that are just plain made up. Fortunately, most human beings err systematically when they make data up, making it look too good to be true. So an astute statistician who examines a published paper can (as some have done) detect made-up data just by analyzing what data are reported in a paper. A researcher who does this a lot to find made-up data in psychology is Uri Simonsohn, who publishes papers about his methods and how other scientists can apply the same statistical tests to find made-up data.<p><a href=""http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/</a><p>From Jelte Wicherts writing in Frontiers of Computational Neuroscience (an open-access journal) comes a set of general suggestions<p>Jelte M. Wicherts, Rogier A. Kievit, Marjan Bakker and Denny Borsboom. Letting the daylight in: reviewing the reviewers and other ways to maximize transparency in science. Front. Comput. Neurosci., 03 April 2012 doi: 10.3389/fncom.2012.00020<p><a href=""http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.3389/fncom.2012.00020/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.338...</a><p>on how to make the peer-review process in scientific publishing more reliable. Wicherts does a lot of research on this issue to try to reduce the number of dubious publications in his main discipline, the psychology of human intelligence.<p>&quot;With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.&quot;",1382914405

6623890,comment,6623040,6623040,2,0,tokenadult,,,"I have been helped by passers-by more times than I can remember here in Minnesota. One memorable occasion, on my first winter here after living in Taiwan for three years, was using my forgotten skills in driving on a snowy road to go to a meeting with friends. On the way back home, my car spun off a freeway entrance, burying itself into a snowbank just off the side of the driving lane. Within less than a minute, a woman passing by stopped and asked if she could help. Within no more than a minute more, a man driving a pickup truck worked out how to push my car out of the snowbank and back on to the freeway ramp. I see people stopping to help strangers here all the time.<p>I was walking home from a research run to the local public library the other day when I had a chance to be the helpful bystander. A woman at the local gas station, who appeared to be a South Asian woman in her forties, asked me to go over to her car. She was trying to fill her tires with air, but couldn&#x27;t get the stem cap off from one of her tires. After I fiddled with it for a while, I was able to remove it. I asked her if she needed any more help, and she said no. She apparently had a high enough degree of social trust to ask a stranger to approach her.<p>Most of the personal injury situations I observe in my American life are young people injured at soccer games--always with bystanders around who know the children, often including medical doctors or nurses--or children who have fallen off their bikes. Whenever I see something like that, I respond. Once when one of my children fell off his bike and broke his arm, he was with two siblings (on the way home from the same library I frequent) and they worked out to send one child home speedily by bike, while the other sibling walked the other bikes and my injured son in the direction of home. I was able to meet up with him halfway and drive him to the hospital. We live in a safe neighborhood here, and part of what makes it safe is that neighbors look out for one another.<p>Social trust is almost always lower in dictatorships than in well functioning democracies. (My two stays in Taiwan, one in the early 1980s under the dictatorship, and one around the turn of the century after democratization, provided vivid examples of that.) People in Taiwan have always been very kind to foreigners in low-danger encounters. But I recall more bystander neglect amid the frequent traffic crashes of motorcycles there under the dictatorship than over a similar time span under the freely elected government. China probably has to move in the direction of more political power to the people and less censorship of information channels to build up more social trust and more care for strangers.",1382912579

My point is just that this doesn&#x27;t sound &quot;live&quot; to me, for non-marketing definitions of the word &quot;live&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;live&quot; in the sense that the guest doesn&#x27;t see IO failure, or need to reboot.  It might well see a pause. The more writes you&#x27;re doing, the more sync you&#x27;ll need to do.  You might also be able to cheat a little here by pausing the guest as well, so it doesn&#x27;t see any IO interruption at all, but that might not be acceptable from outside the guest. YMMV.<p>There are fundamental bandwidth limits at play here, so any solution to this problem is, to a certain extent, shuffling deckchairs.<p>> Looking at VMware&#x27;s marketing literature [1], they claim &quot;less than two seconds on a gigabit Ethernet network.&quot; But it sounds like that&#x27;s just for the memory / cpu migration. The disk migration section of their literature doesn&#x27;t have any readily-visible timing claims.<p><a href=""http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/features-storage-vmotion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/features-storage-vmot...</a> claims &quot;zero-downtime&quot;.  I guess it depends how you define &quot;downtime&quot;, really.<p>> My experience with zero-downtime upgrades has always involved either bringing new stateless servers online that talk to shared storage, or adding storage nodes to an existing cluster. In both cases, this involves multiple VMs and shared state.<p>You can balloon memory, hot-add CPUs, or resize discs upwards, with a single VM.  Of course there are limits to this.  If you&#x27;re solving an Amazon-sized problem, they might well be important.  If you can&#x27;t (or don&#x27;t want to) rebuild your app to fit into an Amazon-shaped hole, inflating a single machine might well be enough.<p>> What does the downtime typically look like for vMotion storage migration?<p>I don&#x27;t have first-hand knowledge of storage vmotion, so I&#x27;m going off the same marketing materials you are.  I have worked on a different storage migration system, though, so I am kinda familiar with the problems involved.<p>> Do they do anything intelligent to allow checkpointing and then fast replay of just the deltas during the outage, or does &quot;migration&quot; really just mean &quot;copy&quot;? And if the former, do they impose any filesystem requirements?<p>It&#x27;s basically the former, although you don&#x27;t actually need to checkpoint.  From the Storage vMotion page:<p><pre><code>    Prior to vSphere 5.0, Storage vMotion used a mechanism called Change\n    Block Tracking (CBT). This method used iterative copy passes to first\n    copy all blocks in a VMDK to the destination datastore, then used the\n    changed block tracking map to copy blocks that were modified on the\n    source during the previous copy pass to the destination.\n</code></pre>\nIt sounds like 5.0-onwards is a slight simplification of this (single-pass, and presumably a live dirty-block queue), but it&#x27;s not clear from either description how they stop the VM from writing faster than the migration can sync.  If you&#x27;re doing a multi-pass sync, you can block <i>all</i> IO on the final pass.  That&#x27;s kinda drastic, so you&#x27;d want that to be as short as possible - and again, pausing the guest so it literally can&#x27;t see the IO pause might be acceptable here.  Alternatively you can increase the block device&#x27;s latency as the dirty block count increases, to give the storage layer a chance to catch up.  Guests slow down the same amount on average, but see a more gradual IO degradation rather than dropping off a cliff.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine they&#x27;d want to impose filesystem requirements - it&#x27;s <i>much</i> simpler if you just assume you&#x27;re just looking at a uniform array of blocks than if you have to care about structure.",1382912447

When the next Nexus comes out, I&#x27;m probably ditching them for T-Mobile, even though I still have unlimited 4G data on Verizon.<p>I&#x27;m just completely fed up with Verizon&#x27;s inane moves to keep all phones on their network locked down (they even forced the HTC One bootloader to be locked). No more.",1382911516

It tries to create a comfortable environment for scientists with a limited background on computer science. Especially for the more GUI oriented users, it is great to have a visual on the variables in the workspace with the variable inspector (like Matlab has). Debugging toolbar, object inspector showing rich text documentation (including MathJax rendered formulas), running a multitude of Python or IPython consoles, syntax checking etc makes it for my line of work as a scientist a very decent environment.<p>There was a nice tutorial given on the SciPy 2013 conference [0] by Carlos Cordoba (the main developer these days for Spyder I believe). What I also think is exciting is that he shows some ideas about how to integrate the IPython notebook in Spyder (last minutes of the talk). Would be interesting to see when that feature further materialize. I think that is a potential killer feature. There are more interesting idea&#x27;s on further improving Spyder, please ping the mailing list if you are interested in helping out :-)<p>Besides python(x,y), the WinPython distribution [1] can sometimes offer some installation releave for Windows systems (don&#x27;t have experience with it as a Linux user though).<p>@Rickasaurus: When running Spyder straight from source, you can have multiple instances running. Not sure in what context that would be useful besides developing Spyder with Spyder [2] though: \npython bootstrap.py -- --new-instance<p>@Derbasti: Spyder does work with Python 3 [3] for the older 2.1 branch. For 2.3 I believe full Python 3 support is also eminent.<p>[0] <a href=""http://pyvideo.org/video/2113/the-advantages-of-a-scientific-ide-scipy-2013-pr-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pyvideo.org/video/2113/the-advantages-of-a-scientific...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/winpython/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/winpython/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/wiki/NoteForContributors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/wiki/NoteForContributors</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://spyder-ide.blogspot.dk/2013/01/spyder-v2114-supports-python-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spyder-ide.blogspot.dk/2013/01/spyder-v2114-supports-...</a><p>Disclaimer: I am a tiny and modest Spyder contributor.<p>Edit: fix layout",1382911516

There&#x27;s an argument it goes the other way: customers trade the immediacy of brick-and-mortar for Amazon&#x27;s low prices. But if the online prices are no better, then Amazon provides no benefit, and a 10% price increase could result in a much larger drop in sales.

6379660,comment,6376191,6378029,2,0,flumbaps,,,"I had this cool idea for a sci-fi book (I may one day write), set long after modern civilisation collapses. Humans survive but with all the readily available iron ore used up, we are perpetually stuck in a pre-industrial revolution world. Hundreds of thousands of years pass and we evolve. At this level of technology we can farm, so we&#x27;re still very successful, and the biggest threats to us are diseases rather than predators. So we evolve towards having much greater conscious control over our bodies and health. Incremental changes happen, starting from an expansion of the existing placebo effect, towards a conscious ability to manage immune responses, and then further into being able to affect cell chemistry in different areas of the body. The book would follow what happens when humans evolve the ability to do genetic engineering on themselves, and the following completely organic technological revolution. (Probably ending with some gene hackers growing diamond hulled space craft and leaving to explore the galaxy.)",1379069933

People are suddenly waking up to the obvious-in-hindsight realization that simply giving their data to a third party involves a certain amount of trust.<p>The reason people don&#x27;t seem to be ganging up on Facebook, Apple, etc. in a similar way is because they never really earned that faith. Take Facebook: from the very start their founder was known to consider their users &quot;dumb fucks&quot; for entrusting him with their privacy.<p>In my opinion, the fact that Google went out of their to, and generally succeeded at earning that trust is a good sign. It shows they take the matter seriously.<p>All American companies operate under the same rules. If you&#x27;ve taken the position that all American companies are not to be trusted, fine.

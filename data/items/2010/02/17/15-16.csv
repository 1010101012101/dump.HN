1131702,comment,1131384,1131544,0,0,stevelosh,,,"I think git's UI is terrible for one main reason: each git (porcelain) command can do a whole bunch of unrelated things.<p>Want to switch to a different branch (or tag/revision hash)? 'git checkout'<p>Want to change a single file's contents to a previous version? 'git checkout'<p>Want to create a new branch? 'git checkout'<p>This becomes a problem because 'git checkout' has to have many different options to be able to do all of these things and all of these options can interact in different ways.<p>This makes the 'git help' for every command enormous because it needs to document the interaction between all the different options. Large help docs are hard to read when you're in the middle of working and just want to know how to do something specific.<p>Contrast git's help with Mercurial's equivalent helps:<p><pre><code>    $ git help checkout | wc -l \n        236\n\n    $ (hg help update ; hg help branch ; hg help revert) | wc -l\n        100\n</code></pre>\nMercurial's docs are less than half the length of git's.  This isn't because Mercurial isn't well documented -- it's because Mercurial splits up functionality into small, independent commands that do one main thing each.  Mercurial's help doesn't need to waste time saying stuff like ""if you use --foo then --bar means X, but if you use --bar on its own it means Y, and neither of them can be used with --baz"".<p><i>This</i> is why I hate git's UI. There's so much functionality crammed into every command that the docs for each command become impossible to scan (try 'git help log | wc -l' for laughs).",1266421907

Your webservice is subject to a set of unarticulated, unwritten expectations   of what a users' rights <i>should</i> be, and if you violate any of these, the resulting PR backlash can make you wish they just up and quietly sued you instead.<p>Might not be fair, but that's how it is.",1266419464

Resorting from name to size of the file it not it.<p>For instance:<p>- Filtering down to a small subset from a large set of visible items. It makes sense to use this effect in case the selected item's representation is zoomed or displays additional detail. The animation indicates that there's a relation between the selection and the larger set. It also gives a clue original distribution of the selected items within the larger set.<p>Example: Show all facebook connections groupped by country. Then select those that have a particular interest as a list. The animation would give you a clue about geo-distribution of people having the same interest. This clue is an additional information you could not see by simply showing the selection.<p>- Reordering (eg. promoting) a small set of items in a large set. The animation shows you how far the item travels when it is promoted.<p>Example: Display the list of tennis players according to their rank at after a given competition.

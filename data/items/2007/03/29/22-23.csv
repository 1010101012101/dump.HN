My comparison was with respect to my ability to read research papers written by professors, not to do classwork at my current level.  I'm observing that math papers are much more difficult to understand and inferring that the state of the art in math is more complex than the state of the art in computer science.",1175208867

7437,comment,7298,7367,0,0,dhouston,,,"right -- but if your employment docs say, for example, that your employer owns all IP you create <i>including</i> stuff you do on your own time and out of the office (yes, a draconian clause, but not that uncommon!), you can be in big trouble if your startup takes off and your former employer is legally entitled to (i.e. you don't own) the IP you created -- either your employer can try to lay claim to what you've built or your investors/acquirer will find out during the due diligence process and not move forward as a result.<p>that said, i'm not a lawyer, and i'm sure others can provide related nightmare stories -- but everything i've heard indicates it's really better to not screw around, and to have a paper trail indicating that you own your IP.<p>-drew",1175207600

7434,comment,7347,7378,0,0,Elfan,,,"Unless I missed a subtlety he meant ""smart"" as in intelligent.  He later clarified that one should never compromise intelligence for experience when hiring.",1175205920
7433,comment,7347,7417,0,0,Elfan,,,"I'm a CS major but by the time I'll graduate I'll have taken more math than CS courses (degree requirements are funny that way).  I would tend to agree with you about the relative difficulty if CS and math but this could be partially a consequence of how it is taught.  If some school was crazy enough to offer a ""real"" (see Dijkstra[1]) program that would compare more favorably.<p>But this sort of proves the original point.  Since cs/programming has lower barriers to entry (cool new stuff is still ""easy"") there are many more opportunities for young people.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html</a>",1175205803

7431,comment,7414,7414,0,0,domp,,,"I just want to say that this program is nuts. You can get started without being signed up so I'd say try it out. It's pretty impressive and I'm almost positive that it's built with Adobe Flex. Runs a lot like a desktop application. I've been waiting to see a good use for Flex.",1175205786

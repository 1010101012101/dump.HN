And as seen in Germany they courts are really taking the issue serious and don&#x27;t just try to silence you. To me this seems orders of magnitude better than not even knowing what is going. Of course, as seen in the case of the UK, there is no guarantee that nothing else is going on but even after the events of last weeks I still have quite a bit of trust in Europe.<p>After reading a bit into it I think the situation is actually quite good. The EU passed the directive requiring all EU countries to adopt national laws for data retention but now there are lawsuits all over the place. The directive has been widely adopted by the member states - in some cases after being sued by the EU for not adopting the directive (but this court is not responsible for ensuring that the directive does not violate other laws) - but at least in Germany, Romania and the Czech Republic the laws have been canceled after they were ruled unconstitutional. There are pending lawsuits against national laws in other countries, more lawsuits  against member states, for example Germany, by the EU for not adopting the directive and lawsuits against the directive. After being ruled unconstitutional and violating human rights in several countries I think it is only a matter of time until the whole thing gets buried. It will have cost an insane amount of time, money and dedication but the system still seems - more or less - to work.",1372381125

5955632,comment,5951589,5954838,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"I think you misunderstand me (or perhaps are reading too much into what I&#x27;ve said).<p>I wasn&#x27;t talking about severity of punishments. You&#x27;d said that submitting to punishment prevents self-deceit about one&#x27;s motivations being for the greater good, rather than for personal gain. You said nothing about severity of the punishment. Given your premise, I disputed that there is nothing in accepting punishment itself that clarifies one&#x27;s motives or otherwise indicates more altruistic and pure motivation. You simply cannot draw a definitive connection.<p>Please be careful about suggesting I am avoiding the arguments of practitioners like MLK, et al. I am specifically dealing with the philosophical debate around civil disobedience, which has not significantly relied upon punishment as a justification for disobedience.<p>What justifies civil disobedience is the <i>mode of action</i> and the <i>motivations for action</i>. Not the acceptance of punishment. Punishment shows fidelity to the legal system one is disobeying. It does not purify motives. It does not absolve disobedients of acting from defeatable reasons.<p>It is not inconceivable that a disobedient might act in such a manner, including submission to punishment, even egregiously harsh punishment, for reasons that are not pure, altruistic, or otherwise engendering controversy for the sake of personal gain and/or fame.<p>While you may look at MLK and say, &quot;His submission to punishment justifies his actions,&quot; that is a very dangerous maxim to put into play, because you cannot apply that as a universal rule for justifying illegal actions. This is why theorists leave punishment out of the justification-seeking, because it has no part. It is a marker for fidelity to the rule of law, around which much thought has been shared to understand what is <i>just punishment</i> for civil disobedience.<p>MLK engaged in justified civil disobedience because his mode of action and motivations for action have been interrogated and found undefeatable.",1372381080

5955626,comment,5953703,5953703,14,0,205guy,,,"A lot of people are judging the personalities involved, the event itself, and the media behavior, but few objective facts are revealed. More worrisome is that objective facts are seemingly being covered over with weasel words.<p>First off, I am not at all impressed how Mr. Parker shifts the blame onto the property owners and others. I did see some of the inflammatory comments on early stories where people assumed it was public land. But even as private land, its use is still restricted by regulations because it is in the coastal zone. Just because it is private land doesn&#x27;t mean owners and their renters can do anything they wan with it--thank goodness. California recognizes the fragility and ecological value of the coastal areas and regulates them. I don&#x27;t care whether he knew about that or not, he, his hired staff, and the owners he worked with are all to blame for not knowing and following regulations.<p>He also tries to dodge blame for the campground issues and the owners&#x27; responsibility, then get sympathy for being strong-armed by the owners into paying up or getting cancelled. All I can say is that he could afford the lawyers, and if you want grandiose, you have to deal with ALL of the issues. His failure to do that does not garner my sympathy.<p>I would also take issue with &quot;It was an homage to the natural environment,&quot; when he admitted the whole scenery and costumes were fake. In other words, it was quite literally the Hollywoodization of the natural environment, not an homage. What he fails to understand, ultimately, is that a an all-night costume party for 350+ people is not compatible with the natural environment--no matter how much he wants the reader to believe so or how much he has paid to make it so.<p>A lot of HN commenter also seem bowled over by all these words, and just because someone says they didn&#x27;t harm the redwoods, they believe him.<p>I&#x27;m holding out for a scientific assessment of the situation. I do know redwoods (and sequoia) have shallow roots and can be harmed by trampling. So, were the root areas (usually within a 20-30 ft radius) of the trees properly protected during the decoration and the event?<p>One of the first stories I saw about this had pictures of the fake walls right up to a tree. So, in the opinion of an arborist specialized in these trees, is that damaging or not?<p>Same for the trout and other riparian species. Are they present or is this potential habitat? Did the setup or the event or the dissasembly impact the streams or drainages? One original article said they diverted streams; was that accurate or not? Mr. Parkers explanations about different kinds of trout and what&#x27;s endangered or protected are not very clear--in fact they seem intentionally confusing. He does say that biologists inspected the streams and found no sedimentation. OK, what about immediately before the event (since decorations weren&#x27;t finished until the last minute) and after the event, and again during the tear-down.<p>I&#x27;m totally willing to believe the environmental damage was minimal. The campground had been recently repaved and bulldozed in places. The set-up crew was at least aware of environmental concerns, regulatory agencies were keeping watch, etc. And yes the media reaction was totally overblown, but doesn&#x27;t that go with the territory of being rich and somewhat famous, especially when pulling off high-profile events? But I&#x27;d still like to see the official report about the damage before believing this one-sided argument.",1372380956

Please forgive the misunderstanding.<p>I advocate for the rule of law being limited back into the original noble intent the Bill of Rights had, along with other changes. The government in a heavily limited role can be more powerful (in the sense of justification) if its primary role is one of humanitarianism. Governmental collective force and democratized architectures for assembly would still exist to protect people from violence. I&#x27;m not advocating for the government to go away. I&#x27;ve been saying nearly the opposite. It has to change. It has to reform toward humanitarian principles with more voluntaryist structures.<p>&quot;Corporations&quot; would not exist. The availability of power would be dramatically reduced to the actions of people. Couple that with a more humane justice system where the threat of caging, literally stuffing a person into a cell, could only be the recourse for containing unwieldy, physically violent people. I digress. The net positive of not having protected classes is numerous. More people are able to enter the market and empower themselves (e.g. no threat of patents, which could not exist). And the risk for undertaking dangerous activities grows higher. This induces a tendency toward natural regulation, because the threat of civil justice and recourse becomes higher for those who engage in exploitative behavior without gaining explicit consent from their customers or the people and lands they affect.<p>The US economy has never experienced this healthy abstraction. All we have is heavily-regulated markets within corporatism, which the biggest corporations thrive on. It guarantees the crushing of most small competitors. Of course, the internet was one of the most disrupting and democratizing forces to combat this unnatural market. Yet, as we all know, the internet is still not yet empowering enough compared to artificial entities known as &quot;patents&quot; that only exist thanks to corporatism, granting the full weight of police force to enforce the decree of big business. That&#x27;s the real abuse of power. That&#x27;s what we have today.<p>You mention Mexican drug cartels. They are largely the result of US policy. The &quot;war&quot; on drugs is a war on people and choice. Like any prohibition of people&#x27;s consensual choices, this war on people directly forms the foundation of strong, well-funded underground economies with a nearly guaranteed revenue stream. Yes, often the leadership of these organizations care less about humanity and more about profit.<p>It sounds familiar.",1372380568

Smartphone usage is becoming more and more ubiquitous, but a lot of organizations simply don&#x27;t have the funds or the expertise to convert their old website into a responsive one, or make a native mobile app.<p>I just think back to my time in the Boy Scouts. We used to print out a sheet for every Scout every other meeting, showing them what requirements they had completed and which ones they still needed to advance to the next rank. We finally re-did our old, single page website into a more full-featured application.  Scouts could now see the troop roster online, check requirements, access knowledge banks with packing lists, and more.<p>But no one brings computers to the meetings, and the site is just too complex to navigate on your smartphone. Propeller would be the perfect tool for them, because many of the Scouts have a smartphone and bring it to each meeting, and would be able to access the information just when they needed it the most.<p>I&#x27;m sure you all know of organizations like the one I just described. But do you know any mobile developers who are interested in helping them? The money just isn&#x27;t there.  The glamour isn&#x27;t there.  But these apps still need to be built.

One of the most amazing things about being on IIT campus was the collaborative culture, and the drive to initiate collaboration. There was no sense of competitiveness on the campus, that was once prevalent while giving JEE. Being among bright kids, all in their developmental stage, seeing their personalities form, seeing them follow career paths after graduating is so temporally connecting. One of the best memories remain the usage of campus centric lingo [1]. I am in contact with every single of my classmate without use of any social network. The bonds formed on campuses are incredibly strong. The support of our seniors deserves prominent mention, be it in school years or after passing out...that worldwide meshed network.

All the content is stored for 3 days, then the headers are kept for 30 days, and shared with other agencies like the NSA, who may well keep it all indefitely if they have enough storage available. They probably do some early filtering to keep it manageable, removing duplicate content, unwanted videos etc. and the headers and metadata are probably not that large.

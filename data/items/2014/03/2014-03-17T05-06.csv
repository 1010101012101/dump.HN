You address your most common risks first, and then the less common risks later.  Electrical fires are more common than hijackings, especially after you figure in airport security.  Therefore in plane design you worry about electrical fires far more than you do hijackings.<p>Additionally this is the first incident of its kind.  This is not a typical hijacking.  In fact it is entirely unprecedented.  For this reason it is a game changer, and I think you are right to point that out.  But electrical fires are orders of magnitude more common so you aren&#x27;t going to ever risk one based on a much less likely possibility here.<p>To be honest, I have faith that investigators will eventually track the culprits down.  Then once we know who and why we can decide what to do about it.  However consider what is required to pull this off:<p>1.  Having an airport capable of landing a 777 that nobody knows about<p>2.  Having refuling equipment and fuel.<p>3.  Having a hangar capable of storing the 777 out of the eyes of satellites.<p>These are not small requirements.  Whoever did this was quite prepared.  It was not pilot suicide based on the data we have.  Whoever did this was large, organized, and had tons of resources (we are talking about a large drug ring or a small country here).  Against a determined enemy like that I don&#x27;t know that you really can stop them at the plane.  Instead you need real defence in depth, and we can&#x27;t even talk about that until we know more.",1395035988

One of the biggest reasons why I personally resort to illegal options (especially with video material) is because of the higher quality they offer compared to legal alternatives, but this aspect is not present in Popcorn Time <i>at all</i> since it sources all the video and audio from YIFY.<p>YIFY is basically a bunch of morons producing nothing but total garbage who would be better off encoding things in SD with the low bitrates they use. Sadly, since their fork is likely going to be considered the &quot;main&quot; one for Popcorn Time, decent AV quality will probably never be a thing with it.

It will also eliminate the unfair &quot;first-mover&quot; advantage that AirBnB encourages (if you are the first in your neighborhood to buy or develop a one- multi-unit mini-hotal, you can fly under the radar and make a small fortune, essentially get a free property). Depending on the local conditions, the city could consider a vacation rental license that allows year-round short term rental--in which case the property can be listed on websites as long as it is described as such and the license must be listed in the ad. Occupancy and taxes must be reported to the city/local government as in the first case.",1395035610

See below.<p><i>When you talk about &quot;global coordinate chart&quot; and a &quot;lightlike curve&quot; you&#x27;re being unnecessarily complex, I say</i><p>And I say that you are making a big mistake here, because a proper understanding of those concepts and how they relate to the LIF centered on the horizon is crucial to properly understanding and stating what GR says about this scenario. You&#x27;ll see several examples of this below.<p><i>one basic prediction of GR as it relates to the horizon, namely that everything below the horizon moves inexorably inward toward the singularity</i><p>That means everything below the horizon must decrease its r coordinate in the global coordinate chart. It does <i>not</i> mean that everything below the horizon must decrease its x coordinate in the LIF. Remember: the horizon itself is the line t = x in the LIF; i.e., the horizon is moving in the positive x direction in the LIF at the speed of light, and it passes through the origin of the LIF at t = 0, x = 0. So a &quot;cloud&quot; particle that is at some negative x value at t = 0 in the LIF will be inside the horizon, and a &quot;cloud&quot; particle that is at some positive x value at t = 0 in the LIF will be outside the horizon; and it is perfectly possible for the first particle (inside the horizon) to be moving in the positive x direction in the LIF faster than the second particle. And this can be true even if the second particle (the one outside the horizon) is moving at &quot;escape velocity&quot;. And it can also be true even though the first particle&#x27;s r coordinate is decreasing and the second particle&#x27;s r coordinate is increasing. My previous post gave more details on why those statements are true.<p>Oh, and one other thing: what does &quot;toward the singularity&quot; mean in the LIF? Which direction is the singularity in? The answer is, it&#x27;s in the positive t direction--i.e., it&#x27;s in the future. So <i>any</i> object in the LIF is moving &quot;toward the singularity&quot; as far as the LIF is concerned, since all objects move towards the future. There is no way to tell, from within the LIF, which objects are going to ultimately hit the singularity and which ones are not. That&#x27;s a global concept.<p><i>To prove the blog wrong you need to show that the cloud doesn&#x27;t split in two, that all the cloud&#x27;s particles can in fact move outward in formation.</i><p>My previous posts (plus all the ones in the earlier HN thread I linked to, plus what I posted on PF) have already done that, multiple times. However, I&#x27;ve given a quick recap above.<p><i>This discussion can be much simpler than you&#x27;re making it.</i><p>If only that were true.",1395035195

This is speculation fueled by your subjective views.<p>Yes, as a person with libertarian socialist views I do have a bias towards the non-hierachical ideal of organizations. But I wouldn&#x27;t jump on the opportunity to argue my point - in definite terms - based on individual cases.<p>I think there&#x27;s a couple of things that need to be said here:<p>* What do we mean by structureless? Even the most bottom-up anarchistic organization would have a clear structure (e.g. a syndicalist union) but no people with long periods  of unchallenged authority like traditional managers usually have.<p>* We are fooling ourselves if we compare a organization with bottom-up social organization with participation as the goal, with a modern company with profit and growth as the goal. As such; &quot;regardless of its goals&quot; is just too unnuanced.<p>* I know that the role of unions in the states is almost non-existant, especially in our industry, but where I live and work, Sweden, the issues at Github may have been addressed with help of the employee&#x27;s union.<p>So I think that individual cases is not enough to challenge the whole premise of &quot;self-organizations&quot;. People of questionable nature will exist in all kinds of organisations, and a fast growing organization will have many challenges to keep a good culture and weed out potential trouble.<p>It&#x27;s just too easy to jump on the bandwagon of &quot;we need managers, people can&#x27;t handle the freedom&quot;. That sort of sentiment is also what&#x27;s been the view of the totalitarian organizational structure of large businesses for as long as one can remember - so it&#x27;s not hard to get unquestioning support for, especially as it serves a lot of peoples self-interest (namely people that&#x27;s climbing the proverbial ladder).<p>Finally; there is a large organizational gap between the totalitarian corporate structure and the most bottom-up anarchistic ideal. My views leans to the latter, but I realize that what&#x27;s most aligned to the goals of a profit driven company may be somewhat further to the structure of the former. Furthermore I think this article is pretty much in complicance with what I would expect of an organization based on anarchist principles - highly organized, but strictly bottom-up.

Of course, we&#x27;ll not know the whole truth until sometime in the future, if ever.<p>Even if this episode were only hypothetical, this episode reminds me that many people have poor decision-making abilities, even if they are super intelligent.  A co-founder of a company like Github would and should have a very good brain and very good decision-making prowess.  And yet, here we see instances of him possibly:<p>1.  Not being able to identify boundaries between his personal life and his work life, and allowing factors from his personal life to influence his work life, possibly very negatively (magnified by his position at the company).<p>2.  Not being able to communicate with people and ascertain the truth of the matter.  Someone had to lie to cause him to accuse Horvath of lying: either his wife lied or Horvath lied, and he didn&#x27;t appear to do a good job of getting the truth and resolving the situation.<p>3.  Having perhaps made a poor marriage decision.  I would not be surprised if everyone downvotes me for this speculation, and am sorry if this ruffles features.  But if this episode is true, there are very few ways that this co-founder&#x27;s marriage comes out looking good.  Either he&#x27;s absolutely insensitive to the needs of his company or he&#x27;s completely whipped by a woman who cares more about herself than him.  If it&#x27;s a poor marriage decision, he wouldn&#x27;t be the first person in history, people from all walks of life seem to make poor marriage decisions all the time.<p>In the end, I am reminded again that people are messy, and no matter how intelligent they appear to be, they can still have the potential to act stupidly.",1395034356

Every component in a plane is tested extensively before it can be installed and used. When it comes to electronic components in a plane, things like interference to other aircraft, other components on the plane, power usage and interference to ground devices (radio stations, emergency frequencies, etc) are all tested and considered.<p>Planes are massive powerhouses of technological wonder, adding something new into such a machine would take considerable amounts of time and even then once you&#x27;ve got it installed, who is going to maintain it? You&#x27;ve got to pay for access to a satellite for the data to be tracked, where is the data stored? Is the data encrypted? How do you make sure only the eyes intended to see the data see it and nobody else? What kind of redundancy is there if the satellite security system fails? Does the plane need bigger batteries to power such a device, where does the power come from?<p>There are rules and processes to follow in the aviation industry and they&#x27;re very strict. And that&#x27;s just the hardware, then you&#x27;ve got to write the software, make sure it doesn&#x27;t interfere with anything else on the plane, then you&#x27;ve got to make it work for different planes, planes wired differently, different hardware/software, controls. You&#x27;re testing two different halves that make a whole.<p>One does not simply just install a new piece of technology into a plane. There&#x27;s no DIY kit you can buy from Tandy.<p>Then there is a cost vs risk calculation thrown into the equation here. How often does a plane just vanish like this? It doesn&#x27;t happen very often and probably not enough to warrant spending hundreds of millions of dollars implementing a terrorist proof tracking/data collection system. Cars are stolen everyday, it&#x27;s a common thing, for planes it is not.<p>If things were that easy, they would have already done so, trust me. Nobody wants to see their planes return more than the airline who paid for the plane, paid for the maintenance, paid for the staff & fuel and need it to help recoup the costs and make the business money.<p>Are we also not forgetting planes have quite good data capturing and positioning systems already? The transponder was disabled which was the easy one (a flick of a switch) but the ACARS maintenance tracker was also disabled and as already highlighted, without advanced knowledge of the planes internals, isn&#x27;t something you can just disable with the flick of a switch. Other advanced fall-back tracking methods were disabled, this isn&#x27;t something your standard pilot would know about.",1395033231

I, as a male, try to avoid staring at another female because I fear someone like Horvath accuses me of sexism. Maybe the guy was just bored or thought that female worker was beautiful. Staring at someone shouldn&#x27;t be counted as sexism. It&#x27;s hard. Would a female staring at a beautiful male count as sexism?<p>The problem isn&#x27;t sexism so much as objectification. It&#x27;s just shitty to treat someone like meat. It&#x27;s not going to help people feel like part of a team if they&#x27;re gawked at. If it&#x27;s men gawking at women, it&#x27;s going to alienate the women. Like, seriously, can&#x27;t people just control themselves and treat other people as people and not sexual objects?<p>As for the sexism part… historically, you know, men are allowed to stare at women and women aren&#x27;t really allowed to (their traditional role is to be coy, y&#x27;know?). It&#x27;s an action that is typically masculine, and it&#x27;s an action that reminds women that they&#x27;re different. That they don&#x27;t quite belong.

Here is a list of companies that do not pay dividends:<p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-companies-dont-pay-dividends-180000561.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-companies-dont-pay-div...</a><p>Note the presence of Google, Amazon and Yahoo on the list -- companies that you have just claimed are worthless investments.<p>Companies that serve a stable market and that aren&#x27;t growing any more, will in most cases pay dividends in order to hold onto investors. They take corporate profits and divide them among the shareholders -- that&#x27;s what &quot;dividend&quot; means.<p>Companies that are growing, like most modern technology companies, often don&#x27;t pay dividends. They don&#x27;t because they need the corporate profits to grow the company.<p>Many modern high-tech companies do not pay dividends. The stockholders fully understand the reason why (the company is still growing), and those stocks are very attractive to investors because they are growing along with their companies.<p>> Therefore the value of a share is the expected value of all future dividends.<p>No, it is <i>the expected value of future growth</i>, regardless of the source (growth and dividends).

You often see this in technology stocks, where acquiring more customers or increasing the value of each customer will hopefully produce even more revenue in the future—and more profits.<p>A company might also acquire other companies. This is similar to investing in the company. You can see this happen in very large companies, where it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to buy an established but smaller company than it is to start a new line of business.<p>Finally, a company might buy back shares of its stock and retire them, so that every remaining share owns a larger piece of the company and thus becomes more valuable. This strategy makes a lot of sense when the price of the company&#x27;s stock is artificially low.<p>In one sense, these strategies have one thing in common: they&#x27;re all intended to make the company itself intrinsically more valuable, whether by expanding the customer base and product offering, by providing opportunities to enter new markets or capture more of an existing market, or by increasing demand and thus raising the price of the stock itself.<p>A company which can do this is worth more than gold; a company with a solid business that grows and generates more cash every year is a great company to own. Instead of financing its growth (or operations) through debt, it&#x27;s free to build up its own equity.&quot;<p>----------------------------------------------------<p>> Your smugness is unwarranted and reflects badly on your character.

I mean, if you don't take on investors or debit, it's pretty easy to setup a sub-minimum wage business for yourself.  I've set up more of those than I care to remember.<p>Now, getting yourself up to ramen profitable from that is a little more work,  (I can live on $15/hr, but not on $5/hr)   and getting yourself to opportunity cost profitable is a lot more work.  But if you are bootstrapping, there is a whole continuum between zero and 'big payout'",1284350391

1685445,comment,1684816,1684816,0,0,drewse,,,"Sure, it changes the way we will search. But is that a good thing?<p>It's all about whether we want change. Change can be good, but think about how long (if ever) it could take for more time to be saved than time lost getting used to the change in the first place.<p>Also think about it this way: people have been searching on search engines for over decade in an very uniform way, regardless of the search engine. Search engines aren't that intuitive, even if they try to be. They aren't that user friendly, even if they try to be. But people worked with what they were given, and got quite good at. Now Google wants to break our habits, and a I don't think I want to. Not only because of the time I would lose changing my habits, but because it works just fine.<p>Another reason why Google Instant does not work for me is since it only works for ""browsing"" and not ""finding"". Sometimes people will go to Google to just ""browse"" a broad topic. They're not necessarily looking for a specific website or detail. So after entering a broad search term, Google Instant helps them narrow their search query. On the other hand, sometimes people will go to Google to ""find"" a specific topic subject, point, or answer. Therefore they don't want suggested search terms. They have already crafted a detailed search in the heads and are not looking for suggestions. In these cases, Google Instant just acts as a distraction. And that brings me to my problem with Google Instant: I use it for ""finding"" 90% of the time and only 10% of the time do I use it to ""browse"". I have a feeling that many tech-savy people here on HN probably have a similar distribution of their time spent on Google Since Google Instant only works for us the 10% of the time, it's hard to justify using it all.",1284350195

1685443,comment,1685154,1685154,0,0,HectorRamos,,,"I won't get into the murky waters of iPhone vs. Android - usually these end in both sides calling the other fanboys.<p>I will say that I tried to get into JavaME development and had a few leads (back in 2006 - 2007) but it was such a nightmare to test on many devices and know which would work, that I got out of that business.<p>When the iPhone came out and set its own terms, I sighed with relief. Yes, its closed and has its issues, but I really like knowing that there are rules and as long as I play nice, I will be able to distribute my app in that platform and it will work perfectly in all devices. I have an iPod Touch running 3.1.3, a 3G, 3GS and iPhone 4 (all bought on launch and kept them as I upgraded) on iOS 4.0 and 4.1, and an iPad on 3.2, where I can quickly deploy and test and be pretty much sure that the application will work across 95% of iOS devices.<p>We haven't turned our back on Android development, but we tread that soil lightly. I could perhaps have various devices on 1.5, 1.6, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 to test, but then even that is not enough as the screens vary, carriers add different enhancements and the hardware is different for each device. Before Android users gang up on me, keep in mind that I am not criticizing it from an user's POV. Rather, as a company doing mobile app development for clients, it is a very risky endeavor to sign a contract that includes Android app development for these reasons stated above. Also, since I am already an iPhone user, having all these devices around for testing is a given - I would have to invest some more to gather various Android devices in addition to the G1 we got two years ago when we were thinking about offering services on both platforms.",1284350012

When I left my job a few months ago, my total income from my employer to that point this year was over 400k. It includes payouts from my last startup I sold, but this would have continued for the next year or so had i stayed.<p>Since this is a financial article, I'll focus on financial stuff.<p>Its anecdotal but I think the average financial return for doing a startup is slightly better overall, and probably decently better if you are highly intelligent and skilled overall.<p>If you are not highly intelligent and skilled overall its possible working at a company is a better deal.<p>Two questions to consider:<p>Q1: Long term--what will open up more avenues of opportunity for me?<p>In general I was not a very good corporate climber. Some ppl are. Some ppl aren't. I am not. I dress casually, speak colloquially and comparatively don't care too much about what other ppl think and don't like 9-5.<p>Given I already have startup success, it was easy for me to decide startups are financially more lucrative for me.<p>Why didn't I stay and wait for all my earnings to pay out?<p>1. I got most of it already<p>2. I'm not getting any younger<p>3. I found a great team that I wanted to start a company with.<p>4. The remaining cash would not change my life significantly.<p>Given all of that, I decided I'd rather leave.<p>Q2: Having been in your position when I was a bit younger and first starting out (relatively high paying job...didn't love it but i wasn't going to shoot myself), I'd ask myself the ""bezos/jobs question"" : When you are 80 and on your deathbed, your life flashing before you in your last days, will you look back and regret the decision you took to jump ship and do a startup?<p>Imagine all sorts of realistic worst case scenarios....completely flops, you go bankrupt, waste 3 years of your life, gf leaves, mess up your health for a while...whatever is really bad but realistic.<p>Does the 80 yr old regret the decision of doing the startup? If so, then thats fine. Don't do it. I think I would have balked if I had a mortgage, kids and no savings.<p>However, in general people regret things they haven't done more than things that they did.",1284349820

1685431,comment,1685166,1685208,0,0,dotBen,,,"This is good advice, but there is two ways to go about it:<p>What normally happens, esp for employees (rather than 1099'ers) is that you disclose that you are working on your social network for farm animals (or whatever) and your employer in the CRM space agrees a clause that says that all work you do in the ""farm animal social networking"" space is yours.<p>However, you've a) had to disclose what you are specifically working on and b) this doesn't cover you if you then subsequently discover or design something in another space entirely.<p>Rather than agreeing all IP is your employer's and then jointly negating your own project, what would be better would be a closer ring fencing of what is theirs and you keeping control of everything else.<p>You would still need to declare any conflicts of interest, but I doubt a social network for farm animals would be a conflict for a CRM server and thus you might never need to disclose.<p>All of the above requires some careful lawyering and also assumes that you have the leverage to write/re-write your employment contract.  Ideally this is best when you are negotiating at the start of the job.<p>But never assume that just cos an employer gives you are 'boiler plate' contract you can't cross it out and redefine your own terms - regardless of the size of the company.  It just depends on your ability to negotiate and leverage.<p>tl;dr: don't ring fence out your IP, ring-fence out your employer's IP and own the rest.<p>--
UPDATE: not everyone in life comes up with startup ideas and needs to consider IP issues. If you are that kind of person, which it sounds like you are, then consider whether being <i>an employee</i> makes sense for you at all (it doesn't for me for these reasons, which is why I've not been once since 2006).<p>Don't be afraid to take the same job but negotiate a 1099 contract instead which gives you greater freedoms (although you need to talk to your accountant to make sure your total business activities ensure the IRS agrees you are a 1099 status and not a W2). If a company needs a developer and you are good they shouldn't care what the paperwork looks like for you.",1284349623

Reasoning that I should get what I can't have and that most people will judge me better with a good-looking girlfriend.<p>When I'm working, I chose to work at a well-known Wall St. company over a unknown startup.

Some people choose to play it safe their whole life, stay, work, marry & die in the same town that they were born in. Some people take incredible unwarranted risks, like dedicating their lives to be a professional athlete/musician/actresses despite overwhelming evidences that they don't have the talent for it. Some people take huge risk by letting themselves emotionally vulnerable when they fall in love. Some people follow the most optimized investment plan, go to the right school/major, work at the right company, choose the right partner, put the right contribution into one's 401(k) plan, have the kids and then retire the right time and finally die the right way.<p>But the market is simpler than life because in the end, everyone's measuring stick is the same, how much money you made/lost. But in something vague as life, everyone has different measuring stick; what's even more frustrating, your own measure stick is constantly changing; what I thought was important two years ago is completely trivial to me now and vice versa for what I thought was trivial.<p>And there's no use in predicting what you think would be important to you in the future because you most probably end up being completely off; plus, it'll just leave you frustrated to forgo your present moment to work towards a future that you might discover that you won't want anyways. Attribute that to any philosophy or psychology B.S you want (cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, existentialism), all I know is that it has happened and will happen again.<p>The only certain I'm certain about is the present; I'm not talking about being hedonistic, but to take risks for the present and to leave the present moment without any regrets.

Magazines charge mostly as a way of convincing advertisers that their readership numbers are legit, rather than for the actual revenue--- if you ship 100,000 copies to people who actually shelled out $30 each, that's more convincing evidence to advertisers that people are actually reading it, versus if you mailed out 100,000 free copies.

2) Dedicate a day or so to browsing pertinent Wikipedia articles. Simply read as much as you can.<p>The former gives you some depth. The latter, breadth.  Outside of off-the-wall Wikipedia articles, you should not be discovering anything radically new.  If all goes to plan, you should be able to answer the bulk of the straight engineering questions. If you're lucky, one of them will click with a Wikipedia article you've just read. See: Fragmentation, Skip Lists, Virtual Functions, whatever. Read lots.

1685383,comment,1685258,1685258,0,0,dotBen,,,"Random thoughts from when I write job reqs:<p>Make sure there is a clear description of the job itself and what the challenges the company and the role itself are trying to solve (""Looking for Ruby on Rails devs, call us!"" doesn't explain what problems you'll be solving, etc).  <i>GOOD</i> developers don't look for a new job using X, Y and Z languages, they look for a new job tackling problems A, B, and C.<p>Don't include requirements that are superfluous, unless you can really justify them. ""Must have 5 years experience"" - why? I know devs with 2 years experience that will kick the shit out of a 10 year vet.  ""Must be capable to lead a small dev team"" or ""Experience with several discrete projects a must to be able to advise from experience on architecture choices"" is better.<p>Ditto with CS degrees: don't mandate one unless there is a good reason.<p>Be clear yourself with what the role is going to be: are you looking for an engineer or a support guy, dev ops, etc?  ""Spray and Pray"" is not a strategy and looking for that experienced engineer who is fluent with UX and design while also able to administrate the production servers and load balancers is going to net you people who know nothing about anything.<p>State the current stage + status of the company ""pre-funded"", ""series a funded"", ""profitable"". Different people are attracted to different stages (and the risk that goes with them) so be clear in the job req to pre-filter those who are not.  An engineer with a wife and two young kids is unlikely to take your job at your pre-funded startup so be clear where you are.<p>Don't use words like ""rockstar"", ""code-ninja"" or guru.  You come across looking like a dick - and far worse, that I might actually end up working with someone who really thinks and behaves like he is a ""rockstar"" because he was hired as one.<p>Be clear with your methodologies, coding practices (pair programming, peer code review, etc) and anything else that will make you look attractive.  Consider getting some before you post your ad if you don't currently have any (why do I want to go work in chaos?).<p>State where you are located, and not just ""San Francisco"" (for example). Mention the neighborhood or even the building. People living in East Bay are going to want to know if they can BART in, South Bayers will want to know how bad the drive will be ONCE they get into the city/if they can CalTrain and even locals are going to turn their nose up at your Outer Sunset location if they're paying through the nose to <i>live</i> in SoMa.  I also want to know what kind of community there is around my potential work place (""We're in Twitter's building"", ""we hang out in South Park most lunchtimes"").  Also state if telecommute is an option.<p>Don't forget to mention benefits (or state if there are none yet) - even geeks in their mid-twenties want to know if you are going to cover their dental.  Same for stock, you don't have to mention remuneration specifics but be clear if the remuneration will include stock, and be especially clear if you are looking to offer a package that is ""equity heavy"" (ie below market $ salary). Again, this will filter out people who are not suitable for that situation and manage expectation of those that enquire.<p>Include photos of your work place, even if you just have basic digs (which is fine if you are early stage)  You can tell <i>a lot</i> about a startup and a job from looking a their offices.<p>Don't use recruiters. Do I have to explain why?<p><i>But my best tip of all</i>:<p>You/your founders should be spending a large amount of your time curating your network such that you don't need to put out job reqs because you can simply hire from your network.<p>Also don't be afraid to simply identify developers in existing startups and reach out to them directly - they may not be actively looking but will entertain your interest (and perhaps) subsequent job offer. Even in this economy (in Bay Area, at least) good developers are seldom out of work so be prepared to poach rather than search the job seeker pool.",1284348081

Are you some recruiting company building a resume`s database?<p>Be honest and avoid snake-oil salesmen terms like ""Company in the bay area with a huge upside"". If I work for you, I have to believe in your vision as much (if not more) as you do and I can't do that without doing due diligence and researching your company.<p>If you are not well established yet, then a brief description of what you do and what your vision is always helps (in your case, a link to your site should suffice).<p>- What do you need from me? / What does your technology stack look like?<p>Be very specific about must haves and ""would be nice""es. You can discourage a lot of potential candidates by putting a laundry list of technologies that you're thinking about (or worse, toying with the idea of) implementing in the future but are in no way what you need from a candidate right now.<p>- What is your compensation package?<p>Not always feasible to write in detail, but putting a salary range is a huge plus. A phone interview + a couple of on-site interviews (taking time off of my current job) to be told that your maximum offer is worth $20k less than what I make right now is a waste of everyone's time.<p>Aside from that, everything else is just fluff in my opinion.

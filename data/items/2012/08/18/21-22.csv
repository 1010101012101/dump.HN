That is contrary to the whole history of successful economic development.<p>Second is the idea that loans are the main financial service needed by the poor, whereas they really need savings and insurance.<p>Third is the idea that credit is what builds enterprise, whereas the truth is that entrepreneurship and management are more important.<p>Fourth is the idea that the non-poor don't need credit, whereas the truth is revealed in market-based banking: higher incomes can handle higher debt.<p>Fifth is the idea that microcredit institutions can become self-sustaining, whereas all experience shows that new enterprises in poor areas that are built on credit alone rarely emerge from dependency.<p>Sure, everyone ""ultimately chooses"" to borrow the money, just as in the most egregious loansharking operation, and they end up living under threats of broken legs after being sucked in.  Only now, 1.2 billion people will be trackable forever by Big Legbreaker.<p>I am serious about Grameen being one of the prime movers here.<p>From their site:<p>By 2013, with the help of our commercial partners and philanthropists that support our work, we envision that, 100 million poor people in India will have access to a full range of financial services and technologies that will progress them out of poverty.<p><pre><code>    India is home to one-third of the worlds poor, who make up 42 percent of the more than 1 billion Indian people.\n    Out of India's population, 76 percent  800 million people  live below the poverty line of $2.50 a day. \n    About 87 percent of poor rural farmers still do not have access to formal credit. Although Indian MFIs reach an impressive 15 million borrowers, total demand estimates are more than 90 million poor.\n</code></pre>\nIn line with its commitment to help alleviate poverty, Grameen Foundation established Grameen Foundation India (GFI) in 2010 as a wholly owned subsidiary.<p><a href=""http://www.grameenfoundation.org/asia/india"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grameenfoundation.org/asia/india</a><p>Be afraid, Indians.

4402456,comment,4400797,4402273,21,0,jeffdavis,,,"Background: I am a postgresql user and developer. I started with MySQL around '99, used both for a while, and then gave up on mysql and haven't really used it since 2007.<p>I do agree that injecting postgresql into every discussion without adding anything new is getting excessive. And declaring mysql dead is clearly premature. But let me respond to this particular point:<p>""Show some solidarity with a fellow open source project!""<p>I guess I never really saw MySQL as an open project.<p>* when I first started using mysql it was not under the GPL, it was under some free-for-non-commercial use license\n* They pretty much reject the standards completely (introducing nonstandard things like backticks that make migration away from mysql harder for no apparent benefit)\n* mysql never fostered an outside developer community (by which I mean people developing mysql itself)\n* the code is messy and poorly structured\n* the development ecosystem, like revision control and documentation (and now tests) don't seem to be open\n* the licensing of the client library is restrictive\n* they require copyright assignment (although not all of the forks do)<p>I hope one of the forks does manage to foster a more open community, but communities aren't built overnight nor are they transplanted easily.",1345327136

4402432,comment,4401606,4401606,9,0,bhorowitz,,,"It seems that most people on the thread skipped most of the post and focused entirely on the firing part, so I'll clarify what I wrote.<p>First, the post isn't about 1:1s. 1:1s were just our way of doing things at Opsware. Other companies have other ways of doing things. It was about whether or not people who worked at the company received any guidance, context, or feedback.<p>Second, the point of the conversation was to focus the executive on what the environment was like for employees (as opposed to managers and executives). In general, I believe that is important to optimize for the feelings of the people doing the work rather than the people doing the management. If you optimize for managers, then you get what you get.<p>Finally, 1:1s were a huge point of emphasis in the company from the initial training through everything that we discussed as a team. Not ever meeting with your people in this context basically meant that you cared nothing about your employees. If you read the entire post, you should get that.<p>Having said that, for whatever reason I didn't make things clear to every manager in the company (my fault). The point of the conversation was clarity. The firing comment was to emphasize the importance of the employees vs. the executives.<p>It's fine with me if you hate it, but you should probably try to understand it first. Finally, fwiw, I still talk to Steve every week and he's done extremely well in his career. This did turn out to be clarifying for him and we'd worked together for 7 years at the time of the conversation, so there was quite a bit of context.<p>Finally, there were 600 people in the company at the time and only one manager that wasn't having regular 1:1s. It's interesting to me that most people on this thread think that it's not a serious matter to let people come to work with zero guidance or feedback. In fact, it's just fine. What's really bad is making clear what's acceptable and unacceptable management. Hmmm.",1345326376

4402315,comment,4402110,4402257,2,0,geuis,,,"pg talked about this last year before Startup School. The gist is that they are always modifying their methods for acceptance and that sometimes, they miss founders who later go on to be successful elsewhere. Indeed, pg said that because they have a massive amount of historical data (i.e. previously funded companies) they use this to guide their selection process during each batch.<p>I've applied 3-4 times over the years. We got the interview once a couple years ago but not accepted, and had a phone call with Harj early this year but not the interview.<p>So the point is that while knowing people who know people is useful, it's not necessary. The team is really looking at who the founders are, what kind of stuff they've built, how they get along and more. This fellow pulled the strings he could and was impressive enough that it worked. Final thing to note is that he's a solo founder. They almost <i>never</i> accept solos, because it most often takes a team to be successful. This guy was exceptional himself, and he proved it, which is why they accepted him.<p>(Note: I don't know the founder at all. These are just my suppositions based on previous experience and encounters with the team.)",1345323832

Perhaps the reason for the focus on the reactor meltdown is that it is a solvable problem; in contrast, there is no plausible way to protect Japan from 50-foot tsunamis.""<p>It's amazing to be able to take such an arrogant attitude. The outrage regarding the Fukushima disaster is exactly that there would have been <i>no</i> fallout if not for several human errors leading up to the disaster -- and the lies and misinformation following the disaster. There is a complete and justified lack of trust in the government and the industry -- and no indication that there will be no further accidents -- whether induced by natural disasters or just poor maintenance.<p>So yes, over engineering does indeed work -- and is a necessary measure when dealing with potential radioactive fallout -- but even then accidents do happen. I've seen people claim that the fact that human error is behind this and other accidents ""proves"" that nuclear power is safe -- this is of course rubbish. Human error will always be a big risk factor in any engineering project.<p>The author also ignores the fact that Japan has done an unprecedented job of mitigating the damage tsunamis can do -- but that the effort had been scaled towards what was assumed to be the likely threat -- a tsunami smaller than the one associated with this earthquake. He implies that this effort was for nothing -- which isn't true. It simply wasn't effective along large parts of the coast as it should (could) have been.<p>Consciously allowing a potentially huge risk -- the long time destruction of farmland and populated areas by radioactive contamination -- versus not mitigating all possible natural disasters and risks of war -- is a false dichotomy.<p>The problem with nuclear power isn't that a lot of people might die from cancer -- it's that <i>generations</i> might be affected by a single accident -- and will be burdened with containing spent fuel for longer than human civilization have existed.<p>Finally, if it turns out that geothermal power is a viable alternative -- then it should be possible to fulfil Japan's energy need without any risk of nuclear fallout.",1345323774

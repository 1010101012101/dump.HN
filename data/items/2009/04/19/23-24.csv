The layout of the streets then often evolves largely independently of the position of the manhole covers, thus resulting in some ""interesting"" placements of manhole covers, sometimes not all that accessible (though I guess it depends on how strict the local regulators are on the architects who design the new layout).",1240184987

It's hard to see a simple way to monetize it other than charge money for the product itself (thereby harming its market share). They might be able to sell support contracts or professional services, though.<p>On the other hand, if you're selling a service, seems to me you could benefit, or at least not lose anything, by opening your source. Would Twitter be doing worse if their software was open? They might actually have had better code by now, since so many coders use their product.<p>Also, you might build your product on top of an OSS codebase, using the accumulated code and domain knowledge as foundation.

569943,comment,569897,569897,0,0,sho,,,"One would actually think round manhole covers have several disadvantages to offset their one purported strength. For example, it would be more difficult to attach a hinge or locking mechanism. Also, the grip hole would not be guaranteed to be in the same alignment every time - if you were using a machine to raise the cover, you might have to manouevre the machine into incovenient angles to properly access the grip, according to the whim of the previous team who replaced the cover. With a square lid, the alignment could be standardised to the most convenient position for machine access. Also, assuming the bars in the ladder are straight, which AFAIK they always are, placing a ladder in a round hole wastes space.<p>Feynmann's answer about the cylinder being the strongest structure against compression is true but one wouldn't expect this to be a critical factor at typical street-access depths. Maybe if you were going down 50m or more, but even so, dirt is hardly as effective at exerting pressure as a free-to-move liquid.",1240184623

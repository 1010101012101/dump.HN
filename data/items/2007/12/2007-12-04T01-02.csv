A lot of work goes into pruning the search tree and only looking along the most promising paths.  Second, humans can actually think many moves ahead along certain paths.  <p>As other's have stated in this thread chess is particularly well suited to be played well by a computer program, but that does not make it trivial.",1196733512

85777,comment,85761,85761,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Why is it unfounded that ""poker is more complex than chess""?  Chess lacks chance and bluffing.  There is perfect knowledge of the state.<p>The long apprenticeship in chess doesn't mean chess is inherently tougher for computers than poker.  It means for humans, chess is a difficult game that requires a lot of training.  Humans would take a long time to memorize and incorporate book knowledge.  Computers could suck in that knowledge in no time.<p>Babies acquire visual recognition and speech in a smaller time period than adults go from novice to grand masters in chess.  So it depends on what you are learning, not just the time it takes.<p>It's also interesting that the computer vs human poker contest tried to remove ""luck"":<p>""The man vs. machine poker contest was designed to eliminate the luck factor by dealing the same cards in each hand, but in reverse. So in one hand, Laak might get lucky with two aces, but in the other room Esmali would be unlucky as the computer was dealt two aces. To finalize a winner, officials added the two human scores and two computer scores separately, and the highest number won.""",1196732869
85776,comment,85761,85761,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"You are very incorrect. Here's where you're wrong:<p>1. Phil Laak is not one of the best poker players. Not even top 100. The fact that you think he is shows how little you know about poker. Also, I don't even know who Ali Esmali is.<p>2. The game (which I think was No Limit Hold'em) played was the simplest form of poker for a machine. Even if one became better at this than humans (which probably is possible in the not too distant future) it will be far from beating a 2-7 Triple Draw player.<p>3. Figuring out odds is trivial, but virtually useless. Figuring out odds as well as a human, who has the ability to put his opponent on a range of holdings, is not.<p>4. No poker bot ever made could come anywhere close to me in an 8 man,  limit hold'em match, and there are far better players than me.<p>5. I don't know if chess has had more man hours dedicated to it. It probably has. But Polaris has been worked on for 26 years. That's certainly not insignificant. Phil Laak has probably been playing for 10 or so.<p>6. I'm a mediocre programmer at best but could easily write a chess program that, with infinite processing power, would be perfect. (I'm not sure if it would be unbeatable, as it is possible that with perfect play one side will always win.) I could not do that with poker. <p>7. Chess may be harder to learn for a human (though even there I'm not sure) but that doesn't mean it is also harder for a machine. Calculating the 18th power of 2 is harder for a human than picking out an apple from a group of pictures. Not the same for my PC.",1196732835

85761,comment,85761,85740,0,0,gregwebs,,,"Matt's implication that poker is more complex than chess is entirely unfounded.  Computer scientists have been trying to create the best chess programs since the days of the first computer as a test of artificial intelligence.  Poker has been ignored because a computer can easily figure out the odds (figuring out the strategy is the hard part), and it was never as popular as it is now.  I would expect that a computer will be the best poker player in the world in a few years, one is already close now.

Phil Laak (one of the best) didn't start playing poker seriously until he was 25.  Contrast this with chess, where if you didn't start studying by the age of ten for hours every day, you don't have a chance at being the best.

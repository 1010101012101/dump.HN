In the Gulf era, you&#x27;d first send in stealth to take out C&C, AAA and SAM sites and get started on parked air forces.  Then you&#x27;d send the fighters and escorted bombers to own the airspace and finish destroying their air force. That was the first few days.  Then you&#x27;d be clear to go in with ground forces, which needed plenty of CAS against all the old Russian tanks. Then you&#x27;d be in for as many years as your budget allowed of going door-to-door and cave-to-cave on foot with CAS against &quot;insurgents&quot;.<p>The new profile is that last part, at least for our current problems.

The planting of opium formed a major part of the Afghan economy - roughly 50%[1] of their GDP in fact - and outlawing parts of that economy is both expensive - the US spent $7.6 billion trying to stop it[2] - and likely to alienate the people who you rely on for intelligence.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that the intelligence will stop coming, it&#x27;s worse than that. It means it won&#x27;t be reliable. The trouble, when you get into this sort of application of force, is that you end up being nothing more than an enforcer for the local grievances. They&#x27;ll tell you where something is when they want you to squash it - and in the mean time, because it is illegal, people profit off it who you don&#x27;t want walking around with a lot of money. No-one trusts you, because your behaviour pattern appears unreliable unless you know who&#x27;s talking to who, you don&#x27;t manage to stamp the things out, and you inflict a lot of grievances.<p>The smart move is not to try to exact control on an issue when it is not practically attainable. The U.S. hasn&#x27;t been able to control drugs within its own borders, where they all speak the same language and there aren&#x27;t the same degree of major tribal issues, let alone in Afghanistan.

A particularly effective tactic is &quot;work to rule&quot;, which is a <i>de facto</i> strike specifically designed to get around threats from management; it&#x27;s harder to justify firing someone for following <i>all</i> safety/regulatory requirements.<p>If an industry is being particularly problematic, this is where it pays to be on good diplomatic terms with other unions, because the &quot;nuclear option&quot; for a <i>network</i> of unions is the General Strike.

Are they a free-speech extremist trying to communicate a nest of rationalisations that explain their trollishness? Or are they something else?<p>Stripping the argument down, it seems at its heart to be an argument that taking offence is a tool that&#x27;s used by the subconscious of people who aren&#x27;t truly oppressed to defend self-interested behaviour. Countless studies support the conclusion that the subconscious mind constructs many of our perceptions and responses. You only have to look at Wikipedia&#x27;s list of cognitive biases to get an idea just how driven we are by our subconscious. So the idea that the mind behaves in this way sounds plausible at first glance.<p>And yet stapled to the belly of all this science is the assertion that people who take offense aren&#x27;t &quot;truly&quot; oppressed. No definition is given as to what constitutes True oppression, other than it resulting in people who are &quot;downtrodden and submissive&quot;. No data or study is cited to support this.<p>This is strikingly similar to complaints by Gamergate and men&#x27;s rights groups that women and minorities now have &#x27;too much&#x27; protection (usually accomanied by snarling and foot-stomping about &quot;SJWs&quot;) and that actually med and/or &#x27;gamers&#x27; have hard, or even harder lives.<p>The author goes on in a follow-up post to attribute the origins of the Ferguson riots to black people &#x27;offence-bullying&#x27; the rest of the country, along with &quot;agitprop&quot; from &quot;Democrat-aligned parties&quot;.<p>While this post is more eloquent than most I&#x27;ve seen that push this argument, it still layers up assumptions and hypotheses in order to justify a conclusion... as evidenced by its insistence on inventing new terminology.<p>This is an inherently disengenuous position from someone who purports to understand psychology & social science.

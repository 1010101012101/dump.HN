33505,story,,,10,10,tacoma_wa_dev,"Advice on web-app credit card processing and invoicing?",,"I am developing a niche business web-application targeted at machine shops with fewer than 10 employees.\nI am charging a flat-rate of $5/day for the web application with an unlimited number of users.\nCustomers pay up front for however many days they want. They can purchase additional days whenever they want. There is no automatic recurring billing -- the web app is simply 'paused' when it runs out of days.<p>What is the best way to go about handling credit/debit card processing and invoicing for this?<p>I'm playing around with using Paypal Website Payments Standard with encrypted 'buy it now' buttons and Instant Payment Notification (IPN).\nHowever, the user-experience for credit-card payments with PayPal is lacking. Specifically, Paypal does not auto-redirect users back to my website if they use a credit card (auto-redirect works only with PayPal payments).\nWhat other payment processing solutions should I be looking at? <p>Unforunately, Google Checkout seems to be behind PayPal in terms of multiple-currency support.<p>Thanks in advance!",1184086544

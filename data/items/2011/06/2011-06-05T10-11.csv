The ratio of accredited investors to startup is so skewed that most startups don't stand a chance of getting funding.  As the LinkedIn IPO shows, average people are extremely excited about getting involved, but they are locked out in the US due to strong regulatory laws.<p>Disruptive startups can't get funding and there are many people who would like to fund them with small investments of, say, $50.<p>Here's a solution.  Part One: Companies register as public companies on Malta, which is EU, on the cheap (relatively).  They aren't listed on any exchange but can privately accept bids for shares from anyone.  E.g. 10 shares for $50.<p>Part Two: A site which offers any company/group/idea the possibility to list (ala Crunchbase) but then for those companies that incorporate publicly in Malta, there's a pre-built mechanism for them to field and accepts bids for equity.  There's a very small transaction fee for this.<p>I've registered the domain OpenStarts.com but it's yours along with the business plan if you want it.  Just email me.

I have solid design and marketing skills as well. I've sold my last startup so I know what I'm doing and at this point in time have the funds and skill set to pretty much pursue any idea.<p>The problem? I can't seem to think of any idea I would want to work on. I don't have any obvious or immediate itch to personally scratch and I've had several people approach me pitching their ideas, but none of them are very exciting to me. I only want to chase ideas I am genuinely passionate about or excited about. I've literally spent the past few months day after day exploring countless ideas, markets, etc... and just can't seem to get excited enough about anything. Sure ideas are a dime a dozen but many are just junk or uninteresting.<p>Within a few hours to maybe a few days, I've always found something wrong with the ideas I've thought of or come up with, or any initial excitement about an idea quickly fades. To be fair, many of the ideas probably have solid potential so its not like they're all duds. They're just not exciting to work on. I've never really had this problem before as I've always been previously excited about what I was working on and have always found it easy to stumble onto ideas or think of ideas I wanted to work on in the past. Sometimes more than I can keep up with and most ends up being ignored.<p>One reasoning (although I don't know if this is really it) that I have considered is that when I was inexperienced, not knowing what I don't know, everything seemed more exciting and I just wanted to do things for the sake of doing them. In hindsight, it seems as though experience is both good and bad in that it now leads to me find so many flaws in ideas I probably would have otherwise wanted to explore if it was the past me. By all means, I don't think I know all that much and compare to many people out there and even people on HN, I'm probably have even less figured out. But I am guessing to some extent maybe in some unconscious way, it's making me less excited about most ideas these days.<p>I find ideas like Square extremely exciting and disruptive. Unfortunately I don't have anything like that brewing in my head. Does anyone else ever feel stuck? I know there certainly are a lot of people who have more ideas than they can execute on but right now, I'm stuck on finding anything I can be passionate about.<p>TL;DR - Can't think of an idea I like enough to be motivated to do anything even though I can execute.<p>PS I know I mentioned Square above but hopefully no one suggests I join another company or even work for Square. I really like starting new projects or ideas from scratch. Square was just a random example of something I would be excited about.<p>PPS I guess I'm just wanting to have a discussion with others who feel the same way. I don't think there is anything specific anyone can help with in this case (at least directly).",1307269398

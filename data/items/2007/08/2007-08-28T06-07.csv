47344,comment,47308,47308,0,0,altay,,,"I forget who said this (Paul Buchheit, maybe?), but it made a lot of sense to me:  don't listen to your users, <i>watch</i> your users.  Figure out what they're trying to accomplish -- via usability testing and analytics -- and use that to inform product development. <p>Feature blight is a separate issue.  It's good to try out lots of stuff, but you can't just vomit out feature after feature -- you have to iterate.  After you release a feature, watch how people use it.  If they're not using it, tweak it or axe it.  Features need to earn a permanent place in your app.  ",1188283786
47343,comment,47235,47235,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, the process is very similar.  My degree is in audio, my early college work in music.  I don't have a computer science degree.  I've known a lot of musician-turned-hackers and hacker-turned-musicians.<p>But I think you're missing a subtle aspect of developing arbitrarily good applications: You probably can't develop a truly great application one block at a time.  Sure, you can add all the features of a truly great application one block at a time.  But the devil is in the details (just like in music, art, etc.), and sometimes missing one spark of inspiration can make all the difference.<p>Google is great software.  Microsoft Live search is a cheap knockoff with more features and flashier design and less of whatever it is that makes Google ""great"".<p>The iPod is great software.  Zune is a cheap knockoff with more features and less of whatever it is that makes the iPod ""great"".<p>And those two ""knockoff"" examples were made after the original--they should have been able to copy the ""great"" aspect and one-up it, by throwing money at it.  But somehow they failed.  That's the subtle distinction between great software/art/music and mediocrity.<p>The Beatles made great music.  Paul Revere and the Raiders made cheap knockoff songs with less of whatever it is that makes the Beatles ""great"".<p>jraines post sums up quite a bit of the process similarities, so I won't go into it.<p>Music is less objective than software--a bug is a bug, but a blue note might be on purpose and it might be the key to the song.  So, it's not precisely the same.  Knowing software works or doesn't might be easier than knowing if a melody is worth anything.",1188283322

47340,comment,47310,47310,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Design means different things to different people. If you mean that in terms of workflow/ease of use, that's going to be largely a function of the team and feedback from customers.<p>As far as the graphic design that can easily and cheaply be outsourced, though even then you'd ideally want one or more founders with a good aesthetic sense to work with them.",1188281965
47339,comment,47291,47291,0,0,palish,,,"They're going to give your ideas to your closest competitors.  Haven't you heard of Competitor Day?<p>/old<p>But seriously, ideas are totally worthless.  I thought my totally awesome idea for a productivity site was worth a billion dollars too.  And I built it and released it, and you know what?  Nobody cared, and rightly so, because it was poorly executed.  Now I'm playing catch-up with the design by making things cleaner, streamlined, and simple.  <i>That</i> is what matters, not whatever your idea is.  Though it's not until you've been steamrolled by brett and his clickable calendar that one can really understand that, maybe. :)",1188281592
47338,comment,47310,47335,0,0,staunch,,,"> Good design is far more expensive than you think. And I believe you've severely underestimated it's value in a startup<p>Good design doesn't cost anything if you do it yourself. Google did it for virtually nothing and beat Yahoo's horde of professionals. They're hardly alone. Maybe it's hard to tell from the way I talk about it but I think design is immensely valuable. I just think it's not some sacred craft that only people called designers can do.",1188281512
47337,comment,47310,47310,0,0,brezina,,,"Luckily we have Gabor on our team, and he is the kind of rock-star player who is in the top 1% of hackers and top 5% of designers.  We use a great design firm to fill the gaps (www.vestaldesign.com). We use the design firm when we can't afford spending internal Xobni team member resources on design or when we need an outside perspective on our UI.<p>In my experience, it is incredibly valuable to use a designer with some coding experience.  They appreciate the limitations of the medium.",1188281474

I recall a submarine captain from some movie who, when asked ""what if you don't know the answer,"" he replies, ""you can't not know the answer.""<p>You cannot falter. Even in the worst of worst circumstances, when you feel like the whole world is against you and you face your demise, you cannot show weakness of character. Soldiers ask the commander when shit happens, but the commander has nobody to ask. If you're a commander, loneliness is not of the least of worries you will face. Depending on someone else for emotional support, in my opinion, is a luxury with great risk.<p>You're a guy paddling a boat in the middle of the pacific. When you hit a storm, you don't look for people who tell you, ""I'm waiting on the island of success for you."" You look for people who can sit in the damn boat and actually row with you, or throw you a rope or even fix you a motor. At times of stress, ""sweet""ness means absolutely nothing.<p>If you are a leader, you share your personal pains only with those who would risk their lives for you. And you only know they would, when they do.<p>This is merely a turning point in life. The sooner you get out of it, the stronger you'll be. So get out now, and make the next decision.<p>I spent too much time writing this... hope it actually benefits you.",1188281427

47334,comment,47310,47310,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The majority of YC companies have not, but it's a huge win if you do.  pg places very high value on good design (with good reason).  And YC companies have much better design by the time they leave, if they have their eyes open and half a brain.  Every YC group has at least one rock star designer.  The best known is probably Kevin Hale from Wufoo/Particle Tree, but other seriously good designers have been involved.<p>So, early stage, it is valuable--maybe not valuable enough to have one as a full partner with equal equity, but maybe.<p>The reason I say possibly not is because I know many of the ""rock star"" designers from YC companies now, and at least a few aren't feeling very important to the process or involved in the day-to-day development (and some have packed up and gone home).  If you can't foresee significant design work throughout a long period of time, maybe an equal partner designer isn't the way to go.<p>So, great design is a huge value.  It's up to you to decide if it is worth an equal stake (it's almost certainly worth some equity, if you can get someone good to work for equity and don't have the 10-15k it'll take to hire a good designer for a couple of weeks), and whether they'll be twiddling their thumbs in six months.<p>As Harj said, a designing hacker (even if the hacking is fair to middling--if the design skill is really strong) is a champ worth her weight in gold.",1188280871

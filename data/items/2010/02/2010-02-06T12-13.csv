As others have said, this is not a failure, it's milestone on their journey and learning experience.<p>Their story has inspired me to write a blog post based around the following premise:<p>Taking that VC money is a root cause of most/all of the ""Deadly Mistakes"" Rob and Josh made.<p>Whatever you think about that premise, hopefully you'll agree that it's not a bad idea to stop, think, and discuss before you make an irreversible, and potentially fatal, decision.<p>Here is the blog post (too long to cut and paste here): """"Bootstrap or Die - Lessons Learned From a Web Startup's Murder/Suicide"""": <a href=""http://bootstrappy.blogspot.com/2010/02/bootstrap-or-die-lessons-learned-from.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bootstrappy.blogspot.com/2010/02/bootstrap-or-die-les...</a>",1265460539

1106166,comment,1106156,1106156,0,0,bensummers,,,"Have done one investor funded startup (not a huge success) and now three years into a bootstrapped startup (slowly beginning to be successful), I can see the attractions of both models.<p>However, it's very apparent that investors have very different motivations to founders. Averaged over their work, investors need to have a few big successes and don't mind if most fail. But a founder only works at one company, so their expected return is less in this ""go for broke"" model.<p>Taking funding gives you the resources to do more. Bootstrapping gives you the time do it right.<p>Time will tell which model is best for me. I suppose it's whether you take a short or long term view of your career, and your desire for size of success.",1265459734

1106161,comment,1106089,1106140,0,0,romland,,,"It's a bitmap font, so it scales as any pixels would but far from well when it comes to readability. If you look at the 1600% up-scale you get a good idea what I am talking about.<p>I remember making these types of fonts myself back in the Amiga days just to fit it on bootsector(s) (memory fails me here, was it one or two?). The difference then was that sub pixel rendering was not an option, and fixed width fonts at this size always looked bad (i vs m), so you'd have to be careful how you wrote things. :-)<p>Without having ever experimented with subpixel rendering I am intrigued by the fact that « is made a whole lot more ""blue"" than » -- spontaneously one would think it would simply be a matter of mirroring the glyphs (obviously not) :)",1265459300
1106160,comment,1106089,1106158,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"Basically: This font is created such that it looks good when subpixel-rendered at a size of 3px. If you wanted text larger than 3px, you would not ever want to use this font, you would use something else that can either be regularly rendered at your chosen size, or subpixel-rendered at your chosen size.",1265459251

FeinCMS, django-mptt, Pinax, and there are also already built CMSs available.<p>Personally I was blown away when I integrated django-mptt in my project, with a custom admin page from FeinCMS to edit a tree of links.<p>As a warning to newbies ... you have to be a programmer to use it. It's not a clicky-click experience as with Wordpress or Joomla. But it has a clear advantage ... for a developer it's extremely flexible (in contrast, customizing a Drupal website left me with scars :)).",1265457693

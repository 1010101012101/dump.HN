7093158,comment,7092642,7093056,13,0,xionon,,,"I think articles like this help to &quot;normalize&quot; programming as a career for people that aren&#x27;t nerdy white dudes. The hypothesis goes, a lot of [women,minorities] don&#x27;t go into [programming,finance,etc] because they don&#x27;t see it as a career that people like themselves can or do choose. Puff pieces about &quot;this person who is like you or who you aspire to be like is also into [programming,finance,etc]&quot; help them visualize <i>themselves</i> choosing this career.<p>You may not agree, but I think having more women and minorities in programming would be a good thing. Because I think that articles like this are a way to help get young women and minorities interested in programming, I like that this article exists, even though it wasn&#x27;t written for me.",1390273176

The word &quot;claims&quot; does occur, but it&#x27;s not in the context of a patent&#x27;s claims, but rather the claims made by a plaintiff. They discuss multiple patents in the episode, but not once do they talk about any patent&#x27;s claims, and no discussion of a patent can begin without the claims. In fact, the journalists seem to make the very common mistake of interpreting a patent&#x27;s scope based on what the abstract and other sections mention.<p><i>> TAL never claimed otherwise.</i><p>Oh, they very much insinuated it by emphasizing how difficult it was to verify instances of inventors getting paid.<p>Also, yes, the inventor was a schmuck, but that should have no bearing on IV or other trolls who claim to help inventors. The vast majority of inventors don&#x27;t try to rip off their co-inventors. (Glass half-full: because most people are decent human beings. Cynically: incorrect inventorship, as in this case, can automatically invalidate a patent. If you search askpatents.com, you&#x27;ll see this issue come up a few times.)<p>nickff:<p><i>> Bread refreshing method US 6080436 A</i><p>The main claim in that patent, as pointed out by belorn, requires a temperature of 2500 F to 4500 F. Toasters typically operate at temperatures at 310 F. I don&#x27;t know what you get at 2500 - 4500 F, but it&#x27;s not toast. The thing is, you don&#x27;t even need to be a patent lawyer or an engineer to fact-check this little but.<p><i>> The engineers understand how patents work...</i><p>This, in my experience with multiple online forums and countless personal interactions over the course of 7 years, is rarely true. Pretty much nobody, especially the tech media making the most noise about patents, even knows what claims are.<p>I agree that patentese seems esoteric at first glance. But that is because it has this particular structure for legal and historic reasons. It&#x27;s easy enough to learn, though. If you&#x27;ve had to debug C++ STL compile errors, patentese is a breeze. This was the intent behind my Blub/Haskell comparison: complaining about something wihout understanding it is really not contributing much to the discussion.<p>reitzensteinm: <i>> Lodsys</i><p>In my eyes, Lodsys is clearly a bad actor. They are preying on solo developers who have no way to afford any kind of defense. Many trolls exploit the extreme cost asymmetries of mounting a legal defense, but by targeting such small players, Lodsys is taking it to new lows. In that sense I find IV to be more palatable because at least they pick on &quot;someone their own size&quot;. (Lodsys has been linked to IV, but until some time ago, Lodsys had a page on their site explicitly disavowing any relation to IV. No idea why it&#x27;s been taken down.)<p>Also, a general note about TFA: I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so landmark about this trial. Generally, trials are &quot;landmark&quot; if they break new ground, and while interesting because the defendant is formidable, this is a pretty run-of-the-mill lawsuit of IV vs another tech giant.",1390271589

Not unless you have so much faith in our resource allocation system that you excuse it from the need to justify itself.<p>In fact, I think it&#x27;s myopic to assume that a business has justified its existence solely on the basis that it has experienced success on the market. A method to make a well-to-do individual or company even more well-to-do, despite a 2x or 10x cost to the competition or to society, is a winning business proposition. &quot;Create the problem, sell the cure&quot; is a valid business model. Feeding the poor is not. Like most of us here, I believe that in total the market is a force for good, but let&#x27;s please not pretend that market forces are self-justifying or beyond reproach. In an adversarial system, the solution to one person&#x27;s &quot;real problem&quot; can be a real monster to the rest of us. We have to make the good/evil call on our own.<p>Most of us are familiar with the game-theoretic concept of Nash Equilibrium and how, with the right rules, you can drive a local optimization scheme* to a globally anti-optimal outcome (i.e. the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma). Since our economy runs on a local optimization scheme, it&#x27;s entirely reasonable to wonder if there are any market segments where the Nash Equilibrium is particularly objectionable.<p>The marketing industry is a great example. I&#x27;ve heard it claimed that its purpose in society is to convey information to the consumer. But that&#x27;s not how it makes money. It makes money by attracting customers, and indeed the ads that you and I see every day are so acutely tuned to this goal, to the near total exclusion of all others, that I doubt there are many of us who believe that watching ads helps the average person make better business decisions.<p>&quot;Captain Morgan has the best brand of rum!&quot; and &quot;Dawny makes the softest tissues&quot; are not messages that are of any use to society. Just the opposite -- they&#x27;re probably false or, at best, misleading. Both customers and manufacturers would benefit from cutting the advertisers out of the equation. But they can&#x27;t, because that&#x27;s not a Nash equilibrium, and so the arms race continues. It&#x27;s not as expensive as the actual wars we are fighting, but it&#x27;s not too far off either.<p>Look, you&#x27;re right that the whole &quot;all industry does is churn out socially worthless CRUD apps&quot; criticism is unfair. Industry has solved (and will solve) an enormous number of practical problems. But it&#x27;s not myopic to notice when a business empire is built on a strategy of dubious social value or to notice when the market is systematically undervaluing some kind of human activity. Those things happen, and it&#x27;s reasonable to complain when a petty/artificial &quot;real problem&quot; gets enshrined while the most glaring &quot;real problems&quot; get swept under the rug.<p>The scientific and humane startups you mentioned sound like steps in the right direction. I just hope that they experience a nonzero success rate. Market forces have a long and ignominious history of serving those sectors poorly. I don&#x27;t have any great answers (apart from the obvious &quot;don&#x27;t defund science or social nets&quot;), but the only way we can hope to find better options is by identifying what&#x27;s wasteful, calling it that, and trying to figure out new ways to address the problem.<p>* While I sincerely apologize to any game theorists who object to my inaccurate terminology, I must point out that it was you guys who decided to call this kind of optimization &quot;greedy.&quot;",1390270724

To me, your kind of excitement, which seems to be pure joy over incredible engineering feats, seems nihilistic. There are serious terrestrial problems happening right now. Massive environmental destruction, humanitarian disasters. Even in relatively stable places like the Bay Area I know many people who are teetering on personal disaster. These are extremely complex problems and engineers have extraordinarily powerful skills to help solve them.<p>I understand why people are captivated by things like comets and why they&#x27;d want to attempt these extraordinary feats.

People get excited about bayesian models and neural networks and all this great research, but there&#x27;s still a massive backlog of problems that could be solved with a simple regression or an ANOVA. There are no basic questions to solve, just the work of obtaining and cleaning data, doing the analysis, and packaging it in a tool that people can actually use.<p>You seem to wonder why more people don&#x27;t take on extremely difficult challenges on the edge of possibility.

Perhaps it is to get people to say &quot;its not that bad&quot; at first, so they could get it passed. What boggles my mind is that people actually promoted the idea of giving up their freedom to another person. Letting someone else dictate to them what is going to happen. Especially the youth, who fight their parents growing up in order to be able to make their own decisions. Then what do they do? They place a portion of their brain that is responsible for making health decisions on a silver stamped plate, and hand it away, all the while with a big happy smile. &quot;Here you go, you can have my freedom, just don&#x27;t penalize me for 3 years and i&#x27;ll put a sticker on my car with your name on it, because I am now your bitch.&quot; I guess the part that pisses me off the most is that they didn&#x27;t only put their own ability to make rational decisions on a silver plate, they put everyone elses on a plate too. They stole that decision from me. Not a whole lot is going to be different, but its just one more decision that I want get to make. Slowly over time, they keep handing over my decisions, until I become an integer instead of a human. Life is about making decisions and adventure, it isn&#x27;t supposed to be pre-planned for you to follow the same path as everyone. You choose your own destiny.",1390269841

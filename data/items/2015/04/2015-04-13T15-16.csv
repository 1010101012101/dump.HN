That text could be 100 years old and cover hundreds of pages.  Understanding it sufficiently to discuss and debate with others means spending hours, days, doing nothing but reading.

We intentionally don&#x27;t want to talk about it enough to implement it, just enough to get a sense for it.<p>The team then collectively estimates the size of each item with a hidden bid system: each person picks a number on an arbitrary scale (let&#x27;s call it points) that only has meaning relative to the point values of the other things on the list.  Once we have a handful, it becomes pretty easy to say &quot;foo is harder than bar, but not as bad as qux&quot;.",1428940199

9368293,comment,9367235,9368107,0,0,lostcolony,,,"But that 45 minute meeting had to happen anyway, apparently. It wasn&#x27;t scheduled or mandated, it was decided by those two people it needed to happen. Meaning regardless of process, it was necessary. The issue is a lot of people seem to see &quot;standup requires everyone&quot;, and &quot;communication should happen&quot;, and conflate the two to &quot;every meeting requires every person&quot;, which just is not the case, and then as they see all their time is taken up by pointless meetings they didn&#x27;t need to attend, they blame agile. I&#x27;ve seen the same mistake in waterfall development shops, and people blamed the process there too, even though it&#x27;s really just cultural.<p>Let me give you a specific example.<p>Persons A-H have a standup. It&#x27;s 15 minutes.<p>Afterwards, A needs to talk to C about something, which will take 45 minutes. B needs to talk to D about something, which will take 45 minutes. F needs to talk to both A and H about something, for 45 minutes.<p>A talks to C, while B talks to D. Then A talks with F and H.<p>Total time taken (excluding the 15 minute standup) -<p>A - 90 minutes
B,C,D,F,H - 45 minutes
E,G - 0 minutes.<p>This is exactly what should have happened -regardless- of your process; these are meetings where only the required people are involved, no one&#x27;s time is wasted.<p>What often ends up happening when you hear about day long status meetings and other such terribleness, is after the 15 minute standup, they go straight into discussions, with the entire team. That is -<p>A talks with C, with everyone still present. Then B talks with D, with everyone still present. Then A talks with F and H, with everyone still present. For a total time of 135 minutes (again, excluding the 15 minute standup). Meaning that -everyone lost 135 minutes-.<p>Now, if you&#x27;re claiming that A never actually needed to talk to C, and B never actually needed to talk to D, and A never actually needed to talk with F and H, then that&#x27;s an organizational problem that is, again, unrelated to agile (or waterfall, or anything else). You simply have people who insist on wasting others time, and regardless of your methodology you&#x27;re going to run into that issue.",1428940159

And that&#x27;s what I meant by management has to change; that reality has to be acceptable to them, that getting relative points, to tell them the approximate amount of work (or t-shirt sizes, or whatever) relative to other stories is all we can really tell them, and that we will pull in the prioritized stories based on what we think we can get done.

The eventual goal is to bring it up to the newly accepted standard which requires tests, but realistically that will take a while.  Live bugs provide a sort of direction to help facilitate updating the legacy codebase.  Setting aside a set amount of time each sprint makes sure that the issues don&#x27;t get swept aside.<p>It&#x27;s important to get to the point where fixing live bugs isn&#x27;t impeding the development of new features, but until then it&#x27;s simply pragmatic to set aside some amount of time to hedge against new issues, while also having the discipline to set one aside if it can wait until the next sprint.<p>As an aside, some of the best patterns on the subject of dealing with legacy systems can be found in the later chapters of <i>Domain Driven Design</i> by Eric Evans, particularly chapter 14, <i>Maintaining Model Integrity</i>.",1428939586

The idea is that you make that conversion based on past observation, using a velocity estimate that represents the past performance of the team and takes into account who&#x27;s on vacation this week.<p>There also should be an open recognition that your actual velocity will vary somewhat between sprints.  One goal is to reduce that variability by improving your estimation (with practice!), but you anticipate and prepare for the variability.  That&#x27;s why you have a backlog (in case you need more work) and why you develop units of work that are independent (in case you need to push one).<p>For all these reasons it&#x27;s a mistake to think of an equivalence at the level of tasks such as one day is three points or something like that.",1428938977

9368146,comment,9364342,9365650,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"This is an interesting comment but I think your perspective is too narrow. &quot;Settling down&quot;, &quot;buying a house&quot;, and getting into a &quot;top school&quot; are all very, very modern inventions, certainly not the historical norm. Most of these problems were introduced with industrialization, meaning they&#x27;re very new to the human race.<p>It <i>is</i> true that people have always had to work, but work isn&#x27;t necessarily debilitating or unsatisfactory, even if it&#x27;s manual labor. Consider that a family that owns a farm <i>does</i> have to get up early and <i>does</i> have to work hard to keep their farm operating, but they&#x27;re not stuck in a cubicle sitting in the same spot under artificial light for 8 hours a day, they can usually take a break as they desire within reasonable parameters, and their work is objective and task-based, not arbitrarily defined by a PHB slaving half of the company under his ego. Farm work connects the worker with the land, with the animals, and produces a tangible, necessary product, that each person needs. If you own a farm, you don&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s permission to live; you have the land, you have the food sources, you have the structures, and you don&#x27;t need to get continued dispersion from an employer to not lose all of it. Such persons are truly independent. While some may not want to work on a farm, industrial work is not objectively superior by any stretch.<p>It is also true that maturity involves accepting the realities such as they are and doing what you can to improve the situation instead of belly-aching about it.<p>Propagandists in the West have done a good job of making everyone feel that anyone who lives less-industrialized lifestyle is an unfortunate, backwards idiot, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s accurate. Consider that humans have defaulted to a basic set of biologically-linked behaviors throughout their history: people didn&#x27;t used to &quot;go out on their own&quot; and delete their parents&#x27; progress for the family, people lived in tribes and clans (which, generally speaking, were small groups of families that reached a size large enough to qualify for a larger designation) and shared the land and the fruits of labor among themselves. People didn&#x27;t used to delay biological imperatives like child-bearing in order to collect certificates and approvals from governing bodies. Generations were bound together with a tangibility and mutual concern that we don&#x27;t know here in the U.S. of A., where almost everyone is a stranger.<p>The industrial oligarchs have set up a system that centers on debt. That&#x27;s why the propaganda puts down inheritance and other arrangements that mitigate the need of anyone to pay interest. Industrialization has turned every American into its indentured servant, as it&#x27;s very difficult to maintain a good standard of living without relying on high-interest loans for most of life&#x27;s substantial necessities: it&#x27;s presumed that you&#x27;ll be taking out big loans to provide for shelter, transportation, and education and training, and then it&#x27;s highly encouraged to do the same for anything and everything else. And that&#x27;s just the private sector; the government taxes away a large amount of the personal wealth generated every year. Personally, I hope I can claw my way out of this pit and give lands and monies to my posterity such that they don&#x27;t have to live their lives based on someone else&#x27;s ability to collect interest. I want them to be truly independent and my goal is provide that to them, and raise them to be competent to manage it. I hope it stays in the family for many generations and saves large numbers of my posterity from indentured servitude.<p>There is absolutely much that has been lost in modern society. I don&#x27;t want to paint a rosy picture and pretend there was never revolt, discontent, or war before industrialization, because there certainly was, but most people then, as most people now, simply wanted to live their own lives in a reasonable degree of personal comfort and satisfaction (which includes providing useful labor to the community), and one could argue that their systems were more supportive of that than ours.",1428938844

In brief, it says that if anything can be done incorrectly, someone will eventually do it that way.  It was a warning to those designing things, to make doing the wrong thing impossible, or at least much more difficult to do accidentally.<p>As a result, among those taught about Murphy&#x27;s Law, &quot;doing it wrong&quot; was a <i>design flaw</i>.  If, for instance, you could destroy radio reception in a handheld device by holding it in a particular way--a way that did not cause pain or discomfort in an ordinary human hand--it was the fault of the device manufacturer, not the user.<p>If you can do Agile &quot;wrong&quot;, then it is a problem with Agile.<p>As for myself, I just think to myself that someone, somewhere, has weaponized an idiot, and has launched it against me.  It is equal parts Inspector Clouseau, Mister Gumby, Ali G, Drunken Master, and a particularly evil djinn.  He will do exactly what you ask, in the most malicious manner possible.  He will follow a process with absolute rigor, and produce the worst possible outcome.<p>I firmly believe that such people actually exist--individuals so brutally incompetent that they are indistinguishable from malicious trolls.  So you might as well plan around a person intentionally trying to break your design while still maintaining the plausible deniability of not breaking any of your rules.<p>Agile cannot hold up under the assault of a weaponized idiot.

I worked in offices for about 10 years and just never felt comfortable in the cube life.<p>I think one of the biggest improvements is that when I need to take a break, my breaks feel productive. 20 minutes of cleaning the house, as an example, feels completely mind-clearing and, in some cases, actually helps me solve an issue I may have. I really enjoy my daily runs or bike rides, which help me feel like I&#x27;m more than just a developer, that I get to take advantage of the day.<p>That being said, I believe the biggest drawback is the monotony of the at-home routine.

9368037,comment,9367055,9367055,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"&quot;Demand destruction&quot; is nonsense.  There will always be demand for hydrocarbons.  Oil and its distillates remain the only viable means of fueling most motor vehicles, Tesla&#x27;s hype machine notwithstanding.  Even if you could somehow find the trillions of dollars needed to electrify every railway in the world and the tens of trillions more to build enough lithium batteries to replace every auto on the world&#x27;s roads with an electric one (assuming you didn&#x27;t use that lithium for grid-tied residential storage instead), you would still have shipping, industrial processes, home heating, forklifts, barbecues, remote residential, mining, and forestry applications, trucking, job site, datacenter, and medical generators, legacy power plants, and countless other sources of demand for petroleum products.  Plus some that probably don&#x27;t even exist yet (many of which may well be carbon-neutral, unlike fuel applications).  The notion that $150 oil&#x27;s modest pinching of SUV drivers&#x27; wallets will magically make all of the above go away is lunacy.<p>This is great for all the shale and other high-cost producers, at least for those with patient investors.  The Saudis are setting things up so that the folks with shale will be the last people with accessible oil.  The sooner the shale producers shut down, the more oil they&#x27;ll have available to sell later at prices vastly higher than any ever seen.  Meanwhile, the Saudis will have pumped their fields dry at rock bottom prices, minimizing their total return.  Economically speaking, this is the biggest gift to the US and Canada that the Saudis could possibly make.  All that&#x27;s left is for investors in shale to sit tight, or failing that to sell out to wiser ones at fire-sale prices.  Keep careful watch on who buys up the leases from bankrupt shale producers over the next year or two; if they have the right attitude they will be worth a dozen fortunes a few decades down the road.<p>Thanks, Naimi!",1428937624

I'm certainly not claiming that there is <i>no</i> other valuable use for meetings than making specific decisions or determining the answers to specific questions. The briefing-style meeting I mentioned before is another kind of event entirely, and so is a review meeting of the kind you're describing. They should be conducted accordingly.<p>That said, FWIW, I found that there is a serious danger of groupthink in a review meeting if the participants haven't each taken a pass at the material independently before that meeting. There are always ""loud"" people and ""quiet"" people, and a good chairperson will be able to moderate that effect, but almost everyone seems to latch onto a trail of thought easily once the suggestion is there. That is the last thing you want, if you're trying to get multiple points of view on something during a review. In practice, I've found that can reduce review meetings to finding essentially those basic issues that a subset of the attendees would have found independently anyway, but lose the input from others. The upside is that sometimes you will explore the issues you do find more deeply, but you could do that either way.",1282348089

It happens when someone is oblivious to the emotions of the people around them, and it's generally characterized by consistently being far too blunt, or dismissively laughing at something that frightens everybody else. Communication is as much about the emotion conveyed as the actual words. If Schmidt thinks it's just a matter of time before it will be the norm to ditch your identity for fear of embarrassment, he's creepy. He's especially creepy because he's dedicated himself to creating the technology that will force temporary identities.<p>The following scene was described in the fortune magazine article:<p><i>“All this information that you have about us: where does it go? Who has access to that?” (Google servers and Google employees, under careful rules, Schmidt said.) “Does that scare everyone in this room?” The questioner asked, to applause. “Would you prefer someone else?” Schmidt shot back – to laughter and even greater applause. “Is there a government that you would prefer to be in charge of this?”</i><p>A room full of tech journalists cheering and applauding a tech CEO for saying that he's the best person to know everything about everyone is about as creepy as it gets. It sounds like a work of fiction deliberately crafted to be creepy. But Schmidt is insensitive to how most people feel about privacy. He just thinks he escaped a tough question with a clever one-liner.",1282348036

1621915,comment,1620786,1621157,0,0,SeanLuke,,,"> This situation seems to have balkanized the field (page through a recent GECCO proceedings, for example), and holds back wider progress.<p>Stochastic optimization has always been balkanized, but not because of a lack of methodology or benchmarks, but rather because the field was simultaneously invented in several different locations (Evolutionary Programming in San Diego and at NSF, Evolution Strategies in Germany, the Genetic Algorithm in Michigan).  That's what happens in such situations: you get competition and differentiation when there really isn't much.  Due to various political reasons, GECCO and CEC broke apart and GECCO itself decided to divide itself up by topic.  In the meantime, alternative methods (ACO, PSO, various single-state ""metaheuristics"", etc.) have danced about at the periphery.<p>I think your criticism of benchmarks is much too harsh.  First off, it's not really true.  A number of areas in evolutionary computation have very well established benchmarks: certainly this is the case for genetic programming; and for vector representations (Rastrigin? Rosenbrock? Schwefel? The De Jong test suite? Griewangk?  Etc.).  Also multiobjective optimization has established a fairly common set of benchmarks.  Second, much of the remainder of the field consists of different kinds of solution representations (ACO; various graph representations such as NEAT/HyperNEAT; list representations; etc.) and in such situations unifying benchmarks make no sense.  It's like insisting that the Iris data set be used for problems in text mining.<p>I think there's quite a large degree of theoretical work among these techniques.  Indeed there are entire theoretical conferences.  But if you're looking for field-wide theoretical foundation, you're barking up the wrong tree.  The problem is that most ""interesting"" solution representations result in dynamics which are essentially impossible to base a theoretical foundation on.  In a real sense, various other fields have theoretical foundations because their problems are well formed.  Stochastic optimization by its nature is tackling nastier problems for which there is no well-formed solution concept.  The problems are ugly and hairy.  This shouldn't reflect on the researchers brave enough to tackle them.",1282347978

1621907,comment,1621491,1621491,0,0,Tycho,,,"On the subject if Inception...<p>I injured my shoulder playing football last week, with the result that lying down in bed can be quite uncomfortable. This means that I wake up quite a few times during the night, presumably as I toss and turn during light sleep phases. An interesting side effect of this is that I get to remember all dreams that I have during the night, not just the last one (usually the only one you remember cause it's the one you wake from).<p>Now, one surprise was how lucid some of these other dreams were. But more fascinating was that the content of the <i>first</i> dream was basically 'the top idea on my mind' from that day (and every day unfortunately, but that's another story). You see I hardly ever dream about the top idea on my mind, at least I didn't think I did. The dreams I remember are usually related to some minor point of the day. Otherwise it'd be great cause you could always choose what to dream about just by thinking about it a lot... well anyway my theory is that you dream about your top idea <i>first</i> and then forget about. By the time you get to your last nightly dream you're onto those minor issues at the end of the stack.<p>Also suggests that when people wake up with solutions to problems, it wasn't the subconscious, but rather something they consciously worked out in a dream they later forgot.<p>I don't think it'd be possible to perform Inception on yourself waking or dreaming, but perhaps one strategy would be identifying what really IS the top idea. You may think it's money matters, leaving you helpless to free your mind until resolution arrives (which could be out of your control), but maybe it's really something else like you haven't planned what to do once the matter is settled. Take your thoughts as far as they'll go, follow up every avenue of inquiry to a reasonable end, and then they'll leave you alone.",1282347313

1621890,comment,1620312,1621365,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I'm sick and tired of the downvote barrage lately. That aside, let me try a completely different tack, maybe that sheds some light on the problem.<p>The complexity of a Turing machine is a function of the number of states that it can encode, in programming languages we call that 'expressiveness'. You can write a smaller program in a language that is more expressive. A Turing machine that allows more states is going to require a shorter tape (fewer cells) to do its work but will be more complex.<p>The argument I think that Kurzweil makes with his 50 MB figure is that once you take out all the redundancy you've taken out the expressiveness factor. Whatever emulator you use to interpret that 50 MB you'll end up with some 3D structure (if you simulate the embryology properly) that will resemble a brain.<p>The part where the analogy goes wrong according to me is by postulating a machine that this stuff should run on. The 'emulator' is nothing but the endless repetition of ribosomes threading RNA in order to produce more polypeptide chains which then fold up in order to become proteins.<p>Your 'emulator' in this case is a physics program, and not even a very complicated one, albeit with an absolutely astronomical data set for any size organism.<p>In order to avoid having to deal with that data set we try to achieve a higher level model of what the brain <i>does</i>, instead of trying to model what it <i>is</i>.<p>But that does not change the fact that the principle of the emulator (a 'mere' matter of programming) and the code that governs the construction are what gives rise to the brain and through there to intelligence.<p>So the upper bound of the problem in terms of complexity is the 50 M + whatever you need in terms of physics to (theoretically) run the simulation of the single fertilized ovum from start to finish, or as much as you need to verify that you have indeed succeeded in your simulation goal.<p>It can't get more complex than that, even if the generated structure is orders of magnitude more complex at first glance than the input data + the program. Think of it as 'output'. Thought is <i>not</i> the output of that program. Thought is the state changes within the produced (or simulated) brain.<p>The organic soup and all the proteins arising from it are the nuts and bolts the machinery is made of. That doesn't mean that we can't make similar machinery without those particular nuts and bolts.<p>I hope that all makes sense.",1282346593

How do I know the results I see are aligned with my interests?<p>Since Google's customers are advertisers, it wouldn't be unreasonable to guess that the search results are at least to some extent tuned to maximize advertising revenue for Google, as opposed to my needs for quality, breadth of coverage, historically significant results etc.<p>The algorithm may not be tuned to favor specific interests, but it clearly has a structural bias that favors certain kinds of information over other kinds.<p>I think that having so much of the web's information flow governed by secret algorithms is very much a cause for concern.",1282346557

Hopefully you'll come to a different opinion.<p>About the emulator, the length of the emulated program is the length of the emulator plus the length of the representation of the program.  On standard machine architectures you can represent binary data directly with little overhead.  (Somewhere you have to declare the length of the binary data, so there is some overhead.)  If you're encoding binary data within a programming language you may have a constant factor of encoding overhead because of your need to avoid reserved characters, etc.  This is typically a small constant factor.  I'm aware of no practical examples where that overhead is exponential, or even super-linear.<p>About Omega, I understand the argument that you're trying to make.  Your argument is that if Omega_A and Omega_B are to vary, then some programs from A have to go to much longer programs on B.  My point is that this is not true, all that is necessary is that the programs from A have to be lost in a much larger sea of valid programs in B.  Given that the number of programs of length n varies exponentially in the size of n, there are enough programs that this will happen even if all programs in A go to programs that are just a fixed number of bytes larger in B.  Therefore Omega_A tells you very little about Omega_B.",1282345917

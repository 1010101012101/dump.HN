For those of you who aren't aware of the history of this company I strongly suggest you do some reading if you have the time. We're talking about a company more aggressive and protective of its patents than Apple or any tech company anyone has ever seen before.<p>History has proven that the courts aren't exactly all too good at delivering fair, unbiased and swift justice when it comes to a Monsanto vs (insert rural farmer here) cases. I hope Bowman wins this case, it'll hopefully set a precedent and example that Monsanto can't walk over family farmers trying to make an honest living. Most of the prior cases Monsanto has brought against farmers usually end up being settled because the defendant runs out of money to keep fighting and ends up losing everything they own.<p>It's companies like Monsanto that are ruining family farming. If this continues farming as we know it will cease to exist in the traditional sense as we all know it and eventually the only farms that will exist will be corporately owned ones.",1360486690

Whenever a reference can be either Some(value) or None, then you are made aware of it and you are also forced to either handle it (by giving a default value, or throwing a better documented exception) or you can simply pass the value along as is and make it somebody else's problem.<p>Option[T] in Scala is also a monadic type, as it implements filter(), map() and flatMap(). It's really easy and effective to work with Option[T]. In comparison with ""null"", which isn't a value that you can work with other than doing equality tests, None on the other hand is an empty container for which you know at compile-time the type of the value it should contain and in Scala it's also an object that knows how to do filter(), map() and flatMap().<p>My code is basically free of NullPointerExceptions. This doesn't mean that certain errors can't still be triggered by null pointers, but those errors are better documented. What's better? A NullPointerException or a ConfigSettingMissing(""db.url"")?<p>Of course, to tell you the truth, Option[T] (or Maybe as it is named in Haskell) is only really useful in a static language. In a dynamic language, such as Clojure, especially if you have multi-methods or something similar, well in such a case Option[T] is less useful.

I still haven't been able to take up the offer (although I will one-day because they are on my dream-list of jobs).<p>Might be worth a shot seeing if you could drop by the office.

The width of the entire slice is 500 pixels, and Facebook's width is about 285 pixels - that's 57% of the width. But the <i>area</i> of the Facebook ring is obviously much greater than 57% of the entire slice.<p>In fact, since the area varies with the square of the radius, the inner rings all combined (43%) are only 18.5% of the area, and the Facebook ring is 81.5% of the area!<p>Or consider the two slices that are supposed to represent 13% each. The inner blue slice is 6.37% of the total area, and the red slice next to it is 8.88%. That's 40% bigger than the other slice that is supposed to represent the same amount.<p>Using widths that give correct areas would be misleading visually too, because the widths would then look wrong. Facebook's 57% would be only 34% of the width, and the inner rings combined would be 66% of the width.<p>I think the only way to fix this and stick with the pie representation would be to make the sections <i>angles</i> of the slice instead of rings within it.<p>For anyone who wants to make better charts by learning what <i>not</i> to do, I recommend the Junk Charts blog which picks apart all sorts of bad charts.

555879,comment,555767,555767,0,0,koningrobot,,,"This only works well if every verb acts on only one noun.  After that, the single-dispatch dot-notation breaks down because you have to pass arguments.  There are more sensible ways to write a function call with multiple arguments.<p>In stack-based languages like Factor, you (very basically) write the arguments in front of the function that operates on them.  This works out neatly if things are well-factored.  Take the REPL for instance, which in Factor is written as ""[ read eval print ] loop"", as opposed to ""(loop (print (eval (read))))"" in Lisp.<p>But this isn't perfect either.  A lot of things just look awkward, possibly more so than with prefix notation.  I think there should be some kind of hybrid pre-/in-/postfix notation, where you can write the same function call in multiple ways.  You could even split up the function name, for example, ""if-then-else(condition, foo, bar)"" could be written as ""if (condition) then (foo) else (bar)"", and under the hood this would be the same thing.  I can't think of a better example, but I've done this kind of thing often enough with named arguments.<p>Of course, all this presupposes that ""reading like English"" is something to strive for.  I think it is, though most efforts have been misguided (Cobol, Visual Basic, replacing punctuation with English keywords).<p>(By the way, I think the single-dispatch dot-notation that you celebrate as one of OO's foremost innovations to programming, is really broken.  I seriously consider it writing things the <i>wrong</i> way :-)",1239356000

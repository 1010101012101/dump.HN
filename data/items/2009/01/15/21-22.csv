435777,comment,435748,435769,0,0,unalone,,,"Best of luck to you!<p>I'm curious to hear in your own words, however: what does embedding games do to help a site? As opposed to, say, doing what Kongregate does, and creating a centralized location for games? With video it's different, because videos tend to be shorter and last less time, so posting a video - especially one under 10 minutes in length - makes sense. (Even then, longer videos work better in centralized zones like Hulu or even Vimeo.) Aren't most games long enough that they thrive more from a feeling of centralization and unity of location?",1232056641

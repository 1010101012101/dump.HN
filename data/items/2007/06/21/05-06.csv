Thats all there is too it. Give me a bleeding edge wave of any sort, comprised of a significant member class, young or old, and the only metric that matters is who makes the money.<p>The rest of this crap about how some group ""GETS IT"" inherently, is mental masturbation. The only person who truly ""GETS IT"" is the old fart VC who cashes the biggest checks while getting the young and the dumb to paint the fence. Praise be unto him, Samuel Clemens was right. <p>As I grew older, and discarded the arrogance of youth, I changed my focus. The metric that matters most in terms of inherently ""GETTING IT"", is determined strictly by your position in the cash flow. I don't need a myspace reddit delicious facebook account to get that!<p>I need a dumb kid willing to take up front money for an idea so that they can feverishly burn through a few years of their life, and in the end get their well deserved and fully diluted 2% return.<p>Give me that please, with sugar on top. The youthful are there to be exploited. Period. They beg for it with their arrogance. I for one am more than happy to oblige them. Why would I care about what they inherently GET?<p>I don't.<p>In fact I hope that every one of them I meet has this particular chip on their shoulder because it makes it all the more easy to steal the fruit of their labor, which is what I ""INHERENTLY GET"".\n",1182404426

29744,comment,29512,29709,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>'... , FOAF, was pretty much exactly what he describes. ...'</i><p>This is one area I've been looking at carefully ever since I created a flickr account and had a b@gger of a time trying to find, add friends from flickr.  But one thing I found trying FOAF ( <a href=""http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/</a> ) was some of the assumptions. Email for instance. Going through quite a few friends I noticed they all removed 'specific' email accounts replacing them with either web forms or generic accounts.<p>Aside from this the spec is pretty good & has been around since Y2K.  As for most social network sites (roach motels) it is not in their interests to allow leakage. I haven't checked if Fb allows you access to friends (yep, found perl WWW::Facebook::API::Friends using <i>facebook.friends.areFriends</i>) ... so while you can extract information using the API Fb does not markup the client side.  <p>\nMaybe the approach is to create a FRIEND PROXY SITE that  abstracts your social network above social sites? Something that ...<p>- allows you to login<p>- allows friends to login<p>- add various social sites that you frequent<p>Transparently ....<p>- use api's (where possible) on sites to extract friend data<p>- create master list of friends (noting url + relationships etc)<p>- updates this list at regular periods<p>- pay to export <i>all</i> friends & associated relationships<p>Simple idea of allowing network of friends to be linked & captured. Now is there are real demand for this? (I doubt most users frequent more than 2-3 sites.) But if you have to re-enter 5xfriends to 50xfriends & associated details maybe this is viable.<p>This is a flaw in the microformat crowd. It assumes the markup exists in each site. The plus side is it's easy to implement. It only takes Facebook.<p>",1182402175

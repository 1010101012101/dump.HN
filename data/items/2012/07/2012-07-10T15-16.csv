I meant to say that scalability is not something that can simply grow to meet a certain load, it is a concept that your system ""can survive at scale"" in whatever form that scale takes.  It encompasses many things like having more servers, bigger servers, more people working on the servers, more users, longer sessions, more activity per user, supports more features, and so on.<p>It's a semantic point, but it seemed like the author had a very narrow idea of the terms he was using, and was complaining more about his own definitions than the concepts themselves.<p>And the user cares about all of them, indirectly.  They all matter because failing at any one of them are reasons to use something else, whether it's simply slow performance or because your high performance system is so brittle you can't evolve, or downtimes because your high performance, quickly evolving system requires more admins than you can afford, and so on.",1341935900

But more disconcertingly is the subtext which says, buy and set yourself up however you want, without regard to what makes for the lowest friction team, pairing and collaboration experience. In a way this is the cubicle of the 21st century. This is why shops like Pivotallabs don't give their employees individual machines, all they have is a room full of pairing stations, because they realize that ease of cooperation is far more important than personal preferences and customization.",1341935308

I think it's almost certain they will go there (in fact, it's likely the perfect antidote to the MS Surface keyboard).<p>Unfortunately, I think you need to think about this from a manufacturing standpoint. They are unlikely to put a new tech like that in a product that needs to be price competitive at the lower end of their product line. They need things that have been clearly demonstrated to be easily mass produced in sufficient quantity. Therefore, I think it's more likely to be something ""safe"" like a new physical design, software they completely control, colors, or perhaps a new display that someone else is already using in larger quantities.<p>They have actually been fairly predictable with this stuff in the past: iPhone serves as the testbed for new tech. The small form factor means you need less of the really expensive materials and the US carrier subsidy prevents the initial price from being eye-popping. Once they get the manufacturing kinks worked out and the volume up, the tech can trickle down (over? up?) to the iPad and Mac lines.",1341935197

Two years ago I even put together a prototype and started experimenting with it.<p>Our conclusions? Yes, freelance sites suck. Do providers want something else? Hell yeah! Do buyers want something else? Hell no! Simply put; being able to first try to get your project done for $100 while you know the real price is at least $20k+ is compelling apparently. I know companies who had stuff we quoted for $50k done for $1k. And it didn't even suck too badly. Why? Because there is SO much competition on those sites that 'newer' providers have to compete on price to get anywhere. So you can get occasional solid work for 1/50th of the price. Especially if you know what to look for.<p>Then if it doesn't work you just go 5x that, doing it for $5k and most likely you'll have your $50k project done nicely. Note that most companies under $10k price point are willing to go no-cure-no-pay, meaning if it failed so far, you didn't pay a cent yet.<p>If you get farther than this, yes a different method would be better, however, most don't get to that online or they already have their preferred teams, meaning this won't help them. I already know that if I pay a Ukraine team with 400 5 star projects $50k I WILL have high quality; why do I need these moderators?<p>I'm not against this at all mind you; like I said, we thought about this seriously ourselves but we just didn't see enough interest from companies. Basically most companies on freelance sites who want to buy something still suffer from that Elance-Digg-syndrome; pay very little for top-notch stuff. And often you do get that.<p>Also for that $50k the site is worth, you can for instance put 6 teams for $5k on it, having a quite high (from experience) chance of success in at least 1 or 2 of them and banking $20k 'profit'.<p>I wish you luck but it's a very much uphill battle!",1341934990

* HTML mail from idiots
* Syncing on multiple machines, with offline mode (IMAP is ok, but you want to keep full repositories on laptops for use without network, and ideally to process email more quickly than network access)
* Mobile clients -- Android has K9Mail, haven't found anything great on iOS yet.  The keyboard-based mail workflow doesn't translate to the tablet/phone form factor, but triggers do even more so, so there should be something there
* Handling attachments well
* Global directory across organizations (FB/LinkedIn/etc. integration could help a lot)
* Multi-user mailboxes; you need some kind of ticketing/tagging/CRM on top of it, and these are all standalone, sometimes web based, and fairly universally suck.  There are ways to tie them into plain email though.",1341934608

There were big traders deliberately moving the price around, to force smaller traders into margin calls. That problem went away when Bitcoinica did.<p>Leveraged trading is trading with partially borrowed money. If you buy something with leverage and the price falls, you're forced to sell. A wealthy trader can temporarily lower the market price by dumping a bunch of coins on the market at once, knowing that the price will recover when he buys them back; this costs him money, because he gets a lower price for his coins and buys them back at a higher price. But it also forces margin traders to sell out their leveraged positions, at the lower price, which those same traders can capitalize on.<p>These sorts of shenanigans depend on there being unsophisticated traders using leverage (a bad idea for any non-expert trader!), and they get harder as the number of traders in the market increases. Many of the rapid price oscillations we saw were a side effect of this strategy. (Not all of them, of course; the initial rise was caused by the wave of publicity, the fall by loss of confidence when some people lost their coins by storing them on insecure computers or giving them to scammers pretending to be ""online wallet services"".)",1341934425

My point with the Orwell quote is that in most cases of European ""denial,"" it was being promoted almost exclusively by Nazi/Fascist sympathizers. Hence the labeling and stigmatization of ""holocaust deniers,"" which incidentally was initiated mostly by the Germans of the 1950s, disgusted by the sins of their fathers.<p>In the 1960s Palestinians adopted a skeptical-conspiracy ""denial"" that was part of their conflict with Zionism. IE the holocaust myth was fabricated as an excuse for Zionist colonialism. The current chairman of the PA, for example wrote his doctoral thesis on the subject. Over about 20 years this simultaneously percolated into what has become semi-religious beliefs in the Muslim world on one hand and backed away from by its original proponents as their evidence was strongly and insistently refuted in academia. The aforementioned chairman, for example, no longer promotes these ideas. In the instances that it has merged with religion it has also adopted various medieval anti-jewish mythology and/or 19th century Czarist propaganda. Various Muslim brotherhood affiliates streams, for example, believe in the Czarist ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" document.<p>This is why I noted European denial separately.

I'm saying A is not therefore B, as opposed to A therefore !B...)<p>I suppose its possible that Stripe and Github receiving funding will signal to angels that companies seen as having a customer base that is primarily other start-ups are the way to go, and therefore open the floodgates of angel funding further.  But maybe not.  I really don't have strong feelings about this yet at all (which is why I said ""there is an argument to be made"" and not something stronger). Like you I'd like to see a discussion about it though. It seems like we're in a rather unprecedented time for new startups which makes it all pretty hard to predict.",1341932950

As you can imagine, many Wikipedia pages have thousands of links which would be unwieldy for both the hardware and the user. For this reason, we gave up on the idea that users would be able to search for a specific page through the node view. Our hope is that someone who is looking for a specific page will use the search feature, while the node-view will be used for more serendipitous browsing.<p>As far as the double-tapping is concerned, you may be right about it not being intuitive. It will be interesting to see what people's reactions are. We decided to go with it because, like you mentioned, it is one of lesser used gestures in iOS, and deleting a node is the least important way to interact with it. We felt that expanding and bringing up the article itself were more important, so we tied them to the more standard gestures.",1341932908

At minimum, dual power buses feeding any servers which can't be easily replicated, and replication across multiple rooms in a colo at absolute minimum, and across datacenters in a metro area for highly latency sensitive things, or across continents otherwise.<p>I would assume Salesforce is at the scale where going +1 on their infrastructure isn't going to materially affect costs, so I am at a loss for why they are exposed to an outage like this.<p>Especially funny that their status site itself went down -- very basic principle of hosting your status site separately from your own infrastructure.  (Actually, there's probably a great startup in just hosting status pages for companies -- rip off the Heroku time-series presentation to users, augment monitoring with analyzing the twitter firehose for ""xxx is down"" and ""xxx is slow"" and ""fucking xxx is not working"", plus some ping monitoring, and maybe app-level regression testing (reporting on the size of page if it drops to like 10 bytes there is trouble, various other health checks).<p>Makes sense As A Service because you want it to be wholely independent of your own infrastructure, and also makes sense to run separately because you can be ""fair"".

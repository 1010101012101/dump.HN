Little gusts of wind can buttress and make the fire spread, but it can also knock it out.<p>Having the support of the community within the bay area is just one less headache to deal with in conjunction with the many headaches of doing a startup.",1230706528

415229,comment,415087,415186,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Well there are environmentalists that practice a modern-day puritanism in that they deny themselves (and would deny others) comforts that they deem ostentatious because they feel that 'doing without' makes them stronger in some way. These people are generally not too helpful for the movement.<p>I personally am much more motivated by the idea of doing something <i>more efficiently</i> and <i>with less (or zero) waste</i> than I am by the notion of self-sacrifice. I think we should 'protect the environment' only because I find the less wasteful path more aesthetically appealing, and I have faith that man can be more efficient and less wasteful through his own ingenuity, without resorting to self-flagellation.",1230706128

Essentially he is acusing them of being a bunch of party poopers for the sake of self-righteousness.<p>He is partly right, there have been a lot of holier-than-thou types. The problem also is it's a pretty selfish attitude to only care about the environment when it's convenient.<p>The right answer is of course somewhere in the middle. I feel that things like the Tesla will get us closer to the need not to compromise on fun for the sake of the planet. However until we reach that point we should also consider the impact we are having and look for ways we can reduce the burden we are.",1230705583

415223,comment,414502,414502,0,0,halo,,,"One of the key successes that Tesco had was managing to create a single brand that appeals across all consumer ranges, selling both cheap and premium goods under one core brand. Since then it's become ingrained on the cultural psyche that you get few preconceptions of what a Tesco store is and who it appeals to, it almost just ""is"".<p>In the UK, on the higher-end you have Waitrose and M&S Food, on the upper-middle Sainsburys and (before it closed) Safeway, on the middle-to-low end you have Morrisons and Asda and on the low-end Aldi and Lidl. Tesco totally transcends that, selling budget ranges similar to Aldi and Lidl, having prices comparable to the middle-to-low end supermarkets, and selling high-quality goods similar to the high-end supermarkets. I was talking to my Dad about this earlier and he was explaining in the 70s and 80s how Tesco were largely a low-end budget supermarket and how this was a massive shift in the early 90s which lead to them getting the upper hand on Sainsbury's in the market.<p>This was combined with a move towards large-format stores selling a mixture of non-food goods which weren't popular in the UK until then, movement towards smaller inner-city stores to extend their brand, the fact that unlike other supermarkets Tesco had less of a north/south divide and, of course, the Clubcard.",1230705351

Even from a purely selfish viewpoint, graduated tax brackets make sense.<p>As I've pointed out, the fraction of tax revenue paid by the richest 1, 5, and 10% are much higher now than they were when the top tax rates were higher.  And, as the fraction of the tax burden paid by the rich has gone up, the fraction by the poor has gone down, to the point that nearly half don't pay anything.<p>Higher tax rates for the upper brackets don't lead to less taxes paid by the poor - they lead to more taxes paid by the poor.<p>Basically, it's a choice between steeply graduated rates and steeply graduated revenue.  It's interesting that you choose the former.  You claim to be concerned for the poor, yet you advocate a return to a system where they paid more taxes.<p>Feel free to downmod me for being mean.",1230704459

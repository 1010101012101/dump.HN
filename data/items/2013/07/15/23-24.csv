6049279,comment,6046931,6048937,3,0,kyboren,,,"In that document, he proposed two different systems.<p>The first transmits two tuples for every bit of the message.  In pseudo-ish code:<p><pre><code>    for(i = 0; i < message_bits.length; ++i){\n        send( (sequence_number, 0, (message_bits[i] == 0? HMAC(shared_key, sequence_number . &#x27;0&#x27;) : rand())) );\n        send( (sequence_number, 1, (message_bits[i] == 1? HMAC(shared_key, sequence_number . &#x27;1&#x27;) : rand())) );\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWithout knowing the HMAC key, the only information exposed is the length of the message. Without the HMAC key, you can&#x27;t tell whether &#x27;0&#x27; or &#x27;1&#x27; (both of which are sent, for every bit in the message) is the correct bit.<p>The second works in a slightly different way.  You take a message, and transform it into a package in such a way that one must determine the entire package contents before being able to decode any part of the package.  (Rivest&#x27;s proposal for such an &#x27;All-or-Nothing Transform&#x27; can be found in [1]).<p>Next, you packetize that transformed package.  Rivest proposes blocks of 1024 bits, but it could be anything.  The point is you can&#x27;t send (2^1024 - 1) &#x27;chaff&#x27; blocks, which would be required to not leak any information about a 1024-bit message block.<p>But, crucially, you must determine which is the correct block for <i>every</i> sequence number sent.  So, if one includes just one &#x27;chaff&#x27; block for each &#x27;wheat&#x27; block (so there is one wheat and one chaff block for each sequence number), and sends n blocks, then an attacker who doesn&#x27;t know the HMAC key would need to choose the right combination of blocks of <i>all</i> sequence numbers--a 1 in 2^n chance--before being able to decode your message.<p>If one splits an all-or-nothing transformed message into at least 256 blocks and sends one &#x27;chaff&#x27; block with each &#x27;wheat&#x27; block, you could be pretty sure the message remains confidential.  Of course, this assumes all those pesky security assumptions about the random number generator, transform, and HMAC function hold up.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/pubs/rivest/fusion.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/pubs/rivest/fusion.ps</a>",1373932711

Any object that implements the necessary methods can thus be printed.<p>Another example is an iterator class. If you implement a couple of methods (move the cursor to the start, increment the cursor, see if the cursor is at the end, and get the currently pointed-at item), then you can be iterated over by a foreach loop.<p>Unlike Go, though, with Cello you seem to need to explicitly specify the functions used to implement each class.",1373932316

XFCE is usually shipped as a lightweight yet highly configurable alternative to the feature-rich desktop environments (DE) such as KDE and GNOME. Which it is. But that&#x27;s only relative to the resources that it&#x27;s peers consume. However in the last 5 or 6 years LXDE has come on the scene - which is even even more stripped down than XFCE was and as LXDE has a strong focus on modularization, it&#x27;s even easier to run a low-footprint LXDE desktop. But as it&#x27;s a relatively recent DE, it&#x27;s not been a distro default-choice until recently.<p>There&#x27;s also E17 (enlightenment) which has been around for donkey&#x27;s years yet oddly seems to draw very little attention despite it&#x27;s impressive performance. Not sure why that is, but if I had to guess - it might be because it&#x27;s aesthetics is a little more individual so switching between different toolkits in E17 can be a touch more jarring and harder to unify.<p>However if you want really low footprint, then you need to run purely window manager instead of a full desktop environment. But they&#x27;re less intuitive, less pretty and just generally another class of UI.<p>So there&#x27;s a reason why XFCE is (or was) the low footprint DE of choice.<p><i>> &quot;Maybe we can say the netbook was second generation then.

Those games are at most a few megs in size, which means that one can download the library of all SNES games ever made in a few dozen minutes; additionally, emulators are &quot;fairly easy&quot; to implement on new platforms.<p>This alone guarantees that 30 years from now people are likely to be playing SNES/GBA/NES/etc. games on their hardware of choice. I wouldn&#x27;t make the same bet about subsequent platforms (like Game Cube, PS2, Xbox, etc.) given  a) the bigger size of game files and b) how much harder it is to emulate those platforms.<p>So those old school games are safe in the distributed hands of the underground emulation community; we don&#x27;t need publishers here :)",1373929373

6002013,comment,6000148,6000148,2,0,aggronn,,,"Everyone in the comments here seems pretty pessimistic about what this is implying. I got the opposite impression--I think this report is actually very progressive, and that we should commend the economists at BBVA bank for identifying a trend so far in advance.<p>Most significantly, there is this quote:<p>>&quot;For banks, crowdfunding poses a challenge ... However, banks should be prepared for this trend and make it work to their advantage.&quot;<p>Making crowdsourcing &#x27;work to their advantage&#x27; is very different than making crowdsourcing illegal. It would be much more profitable for them to start up their own crowdsourcing platforms. That way, people deposit money into the banks interest earning accounts, AND they get a cut. Instead of 7% interest with a non-trivial chance of default (which, if you account for ~3% inflation, means their true benefit is only 4%), they get a clean 5% fee right off the top. With no risk. At all. Its free money.<p>This is a no-brainer for me. Banks are built to help people get the money they need to do what they would like to do. They would only stand to gain money by doing this on their own. Shutting down the whole system would be stupid, and I think the economists at BBVA would agree.",1373205333

6002006,comment,6001934,6001934,13,0,jbri,,,"A number of reasons come to mind:<p>1. They might not have the source any more. There&#x27;s a depressingly large amount of software that was created, that no-one has the source code to. It might have been lost in a server crash, it might have been stored on a medium which is now unreadable, or people might have just not cared about it after the product was shipped and who knows where it is now?<p>2. There might be legal reasons preventing them from releasing it. For example, be a software patent covering part of the code which they licensed for their commercial use, but which prevents them from releasing it as open-source. An example here would be Doom 3&#x27;s shadow volume code - the open-source release didn&#x27;t actually include the code that shipped with the game, instead it included a slower (yet not patent-encumbered) algorithm. Unless you built absolutely everything in-house and licensed nothing from anyone else, it can be tricky to work out whether you&#x27;re actually allowed to release the source to your product.<p>3. It might reveal other things that should be private to the company. Often source code has overly-tight integration with things like your in-house version control, or your build system, or other things of that nature. Perhaps your debug build automatically uploads crash logs to your bug tracker, and includes credentials for doing that which were stripped out of the release build? In order to do an open-source release, you need to look through your entire code to figure out if there is anything sensitive there, and remove it (in a way that doesn&#x27;t stop the product working).<p>And finally...<p>4. What benefit does it get them? Gathering up, scrubbing, testing, and releasing an open-source product takes a substantial amount of effort, and hence a substantial amount of money. And you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to see a return on that investment in anything except vague, largely-meaningless &quot;community good will&quot;.",1373205107

6002004,comment,6001934,6001934,23,0,samarudge,,,"I don&#x27;t work for a big company, so this is purely speculation, but there could be many reasons why it&#x27;s not done.<p>* Documentation Time<p>If you&#x27;ve got a big project, it could take weeks, even months to properly document some software to a position where it could be used by someone outside of the company. Sure you have your internal documentation but it can often be incomplete, or make assumptions that the person reading it knows about other bits of the company.<p>* Deployment<p>Big projects will often use very specialized hardware, software and environments, to the point where it could be nearly impossible to deploy outside of the company. It could depend on internal services that can&#x27;t be open sourced because there still used, or are an important part of the business. Take Google Reader, yes it would be nice if it was open sourced, but internally it probably uses services, databases, APIs specialized just for Google, it&#x27;s probably been optimized to work on Google&#x27;s hardware, with their webserver, with their OS build etc.<p>Reddit is another example of this, Reddit&#x27;s code is open source, and while it can be deployed, it&#x27;s not easy. This seems mostly because it&#x27;s been built to work on a very specialized set of software versions, and in a very specific environment. Larger open source projects tend to be tested on a multitude of environments, with applications only deployed or built internally, there&#x27;s no point because you can very accurately control your environment.<p>* Some of the code is still used<p>Some, or even big chunks of the code could still be being used in current software. If you&#x27;ve got a library that&#x27;s particularly useful, you might keep using it. If it works there&#x27;s no point re-writing it just for a new project.<p>* The code is very bad<p>We all know it happens, a project contains terrible code, bad bugs and maybe even security issues, they never bothered getting fixed because they were never noticed. Given the opportunity to look through the code people might pick up on these issues and it would look bad on the company.<p>* Open source is complicated<p>Open source seems to come along with a whole host of fun things to deal with, GitHub issues, ranty blog posts, forks, copyright, licenses can all get a bit complicated. Even if it&#x27;s old software that isn&#x27;t used anymore you probably need to do some degree of management before things get too out of hand. Even a single tweet can have a big impact on a company, or a products reputation, so particularly at larger companies they&#x27;d probably want it managed in some way.<p>Anyone else got anything to add?",1373205022

I&#x27;m pretty frustrated, really, that it doesn&#x27;t appear to be possible...  I mean, I&#x27;m in deep enough now that I can&#x27;t just walk without consequence.<p>(as an aside, he.net does seem to be kinda doing it;  I mean, their prices are mostly standard.  Not really, though.   And their power prices are absolutely terrible compared to the high end, as they make you buy a whole rack to run like five servers.

6002000,comment,6001868,6001868,3,0,simonsarris,,,"I&#x27;ve known that programming/CS education is often broken since I had to tutor several (very smart) friends who had a hard time with CS1, which served as their introduction to programming.<p>There are better CS1 professors to be sure, but I imagine a lot of the problems they encountered were common throughout most people&#x27;s first experience with trying to learn programming. There was a lot of assumed knowledge, and the students who had prior experience left feeling it was just as mysterious as when they started.<p>This bothers the hell out of me, because I think these people would enjoy programming a lot more if their first experience was better, and I wonder what I would think of programming if CS1 was my first experience.<p>I had the good fortune to learn by myself long before college. I think I know why it was easy for me, and I was finally able to articulate it only recently. I talk about it here[1] and explain what I hope to do.<p>The short version is that I&#x27;m going to make a series of Bob Ross-style JavaScript tutorial videos. I think that its a great time to learn programming, since every person with a modern browser installed has everything they need to begin learning (the developer console is an absolutely amazing place to start, and the first tutorials will focus on nothing but working inside of it).<p>I had considered taking some time off work to do this full time, update the MDN, and hold office hours in StackOverflow chat.

The 4th amendment gives Americans the right against unreasonable searches without a warrant, and some similar legal protections exist in many other countries.  But the technology the author is discussing generally has a design goal of preventing all searches, under any circumstances.

They should reset the given &quot;intent&quot; after an action is taken.<p>Early this year, I bought a watch for my girlfriend as a surprise gift for our anniversary. I made the mistake of doing some prior research to find the best price... on her laptop! I bought the watch online, using the same computer, but the advertising software was incapable of recognizing this action and kept showing her exactly the same watch ads all over the Internet. Long story short, my gift was not a surprise anymore.<p>That happens to me all the time, I always look the best deal before buying something online, buy it, but then have to deal with ads that are not of my interest anymore for about an extra week. I guess is more cost effective for advertisers to show completely irrelevant ads even if the purchase already materialized, but it gets so annoying to the point of starting to dislike the brand a little bit more every time. At least in my case.",1373202526

I also am building products right now in the same space with my current company (simple web development and hosting tools/services).<p>But when I come up with a new product, it&#x27;s largely something that I know can be made really simple to start, and then built on over time. If I can ship an MVP or proof of concept in a month or two of 20-40% full-time work I am satisfied. Anything longer than that and I risk making something no one wants.<p>I also try to learn and be better with every project I do. That means starting with libraries instead of building from scratch, or being more diligent about the architecture. One small example is that I used django-compressor on a recent project instead of hacking that myself. Another is baking referrals and drip email campaigns directly into the MVP instead of pushing this off.<p>The benefit is that the more you do this the more natural it becomes, to the point where you get higher quality in less time, but I don&#x27;t dwell on the technical quality too much since your customers generally don&#x27;t care, so it&#x27;s a fine line.<p>At the end of the day though, the new products I&#x27;ve developed have largely been fits of desire to work on something new. Once my co-founder builds a design for it and I implement a simple PoC, the momentum pushes it to become reality.<p>The difference between what ideas I choose now and what I used to choose is I start looking ahead and see problems or opportunities related to the business model. Things like retention patterns, market potential, etc. I don&#x27;t measure or predict these things with numbers because I think that&#x27;s a waste of time, but since I&#x27;ve had experience with those issues, I can get a better feel for them before I start to work on a project.<p>Also, now that I&#x27;ve achieved and surpassed my initial desire to build my own company and hire a few people, my ambition is pushing me towards achieving bigger milestones. Some ideas are harder to grow than others.",1373202432

The problem is I have too many ideas and don&#x27;t stick with my own things to see them through.<p>I&#x27;d probably be more successful if I hired someone else to build it, and get client work myself to pay for it.",1373202432

(even if you&#x27;re just sharing it with yourself, on a different client (eg: todo list in desktop browser and on mobile browser)).<p>[1] I just looked into couchdb again, and I think I&#x27;m getting a handle of how one might actually deploy the thing -- but it&#x27;s a little scary to see that they by default <i>turn off</i> ssl cert validation -- which is just wrong -- when ssl is off by default anyway.

I think it is years ahead of other window environments.<p>The best features of ion3 are in my opinion:\n- dynamic tiling with vertical/horizontal splits and tabs\n- easily extensible using lua including information panel (I used it to display useful info e.g. bitcoin prices)\n- query module allowing to very quickly switch to other windows/workspace or bring any window to currently focused region\n- query module can be extended to query different sources e.g. bookmarks or locate. I can even imagine adding hood like abilities to the system\n- query module also supports vim input mode\n- very good commands support, one can easily configure keyboard and mouse behaviour, including emacs like combos, and moving, dragging windows actions\n- can be effectively used using both keyboard and mouse\n- this model of dynamic tiling makes it very easy to move/resize windows using mouse. One can press some key and resize window using mouse without trying to hit few pixels of the edge of the window. Window can be resized instantly and precisely without any mental effort\n- both tiling and floating modes supported\n- scrapbook support - there can be panels shown using single key combination with many application tabs in it - accessible from everywhere\n- session support - one can start wm with already running applications on preconfigured workspaces<p>There are probably other features I have forgotten. I am really sad that Tuomo Valkonen (the wm creator) left the project. \nThere are some other programs that in my opinion didn&#x27;t get the credit they deserve (like ecco pro) and then other projects have to painfully reinvent them.",1373202345

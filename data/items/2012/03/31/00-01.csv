They did everything they believed to fight it, spend every penny they have, and torture every citizen of them whenever they are flying. If I were the terrorist I would be much glad: I don't need to do anything anymore but the whole US is in terror, forever!",1333155592

Talk to them about their views, let them know that disbanding the TSA is a major issue for you, and that you'll support any candidate who takes a stand on this, and oppose any who don't.<p>If you find a viable major party candidate[1] who will come out in favor of disbanding the TSA, then follow through and support him.  This will require money or time (or ideally, both).<p>If you cannot find any viable major party candidates, consider running yourself.  Every two years new people get into the House because of incumbents ignoring the concerns of their constituents.<p>Either way, once you've done all you can in your district to try and get a congress-critter elected who will publicly back repeal of the TSA, the next step is to try and help on a national level.  This takes money.<p>Talk to non-profit civil rights groups to see if they will advocate for repeal of the TSA.  Don't limit yourself to one side of the political aisle!  Talk to the ACLU, talk to CAP, talk to Heartland, talk to Cato, talk to anyone you can find who will listen who is or might be even tangentially interested in TSA repeal.  Make sure to mention that you will donate large amounts of money.  If you can't find anyone, start your own.<p>Once you've found (or founded) a national think tank or pressure group, you now need to follow through.  Donating time helps, but money helps a lot more.  Hopefully you can scrape together $10k or more for this.  If you can't, start talking to your friends.  Don't just blog about how the TSA is terrible, blog about how you're trying to get together $50k or $200k to bring about real change.  Nobody cares about people commenting about how outraged they are on a blog; they care about money.<p>Everyone loves to talk about how terrible it is that money is important in American politics, and maybe it IS terrible.  But the great thing about money is that it's blind.  It doesn't matter who you know or what school you went to or who your father was[2].  If you can scrape together 5-6 figures to throw at a political issue you can have a real impact on almost any issue in the US[3].<p>In other words, the tangible actions you can take are, well, ANY tangible actions.  Talk to sympathetic politicians and interest groups.  If you can't find sympathetic politicians and interest groups, start your own.  Either way, acquire and spend money on this.  Blogging, commenting, and signing petitions are almost the definition of non-tangible actions in the current political system.<p>[1]: Fringe candidates for the major parties, or minor party candidates, do not - in the US system - have a major impact on policy.  You may decry this fact, but it's the way it is.  Pick your battles.  Either lobby for TSA repeal OR a shift to proportional representation.<p>[2]: I've lived in a few countries.  My experience is that money matters a lot more in US politics, but that doesn't make the US less fair or more corrupt.  Americans often seem to think that if they could get money out of the system, everything would work better.  I wish I thought it was that easy.<p>[3]: Again, you may decry this fact, but it's the way it is.  Pick your battles.  Either lobby for TSA repeal OR meaningful campaign finance reform.",1333155501

At the end of the day, the TSA exists as it does because the population is fearful of dying in an airplane explosion (even though these tactics don't much help prevent that), and there's no political cover whatsoever for a politician that endorses scaling back security theater.

It's made clear in this offer that if your not on our support contract, any time doing that is chargeable at our regular rates.<p>What you need to do is make sure you and your clients are both aware of all the different responsibilities in keeping a website up (from the network connectivity and hosting hardware, through the OS, OS applications, web app dependancies to the web application software), in many cases the ""web developer"" has no control over some of those responsibilities (particularly if the customer is organizing the web hosting), and everybody needs to be aware of who to call, and who's responsible for fixing problems at each layer, and how the cost of that responsibility is going to be borne. In my experience, everything between the OS install and the web app software (Wordpress/Drupal/custom written app) is often overlooked - who's responsible for keeping apache/MySQL/nginx/memcached/sendmail/named up to date?

I'm just pointing out that the notion of racial differences is so taboo in contemporary academic culture that it's impossible to honestly discuss the question. To honestly address the question, you have to be open to the possibility of <i>any</i> answer, which frankly we aren't. If certain racial differences don't exist, that's fine, but if they did exist, no one would say so anyway. So we can't take the claim that racial differences don't exist at face value, because that's the only palatable conclusion open on the question.<p>The taboo is a completely understandable and largely inevitable reaction against the open and largely fallacious racist claims of academics in the recent past, but it's still a taboo that inhibits honest inquiry.

3778807,comment,3778158,3778158,30,0,tptacek,,,"CSRF isn't a browser vulnerability. It's a serverside application vulnerability.<p>To say otherwise is to say there there is some trivial policy, just an HTTP header away, that would allow IE, Firefox, and Webkit to coherently express cross-domain request policy for every conceivable application --- or to say that no FORM element on any website should be able to POST off-site (which, for the non-developers on HN, is an extremely common pattern).<p>There is a list (I am not particularly fond of it) managed by OWASP of the Top Ten vulnerabilities in application security. CSRF has been on it since at least 2007. For at least five years, the appsec community has been trying to educate application developers about CSRF.<p>Applications already have fine-grained controls for preventing CSRF. Homakov calls these controls ""an ugly workaround"". I can't argue about ugliness or elegance, but forgery tokens are fundamentally no less elegant than cryptographically secure cookies, which form the basis for virtually all application security on the entire Internet. The difference between browser-based CSRF protections (which don't exist) and token-based protections is the <i>End to End Argument In System Design</i> (also worth a Google). E2E suggests that when there are many options for implementing something, the best long-term solution is the one that pushes logic as far out to the edges as possible. Baking CSRF protection into the HTTP protocol is the opposite: it creates a ""smart middleman"" that will in the long term hamper security.<p>This blog post seems to suppose that most readers aren't even familiar with CSRF. From the comments on this thread, he may be right! But he's naive if he thinks Google wasn't aware of the logout CSRF, since it's been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> on the Internet since at least 2008 (as the top of the first search result for [Google logout CSRF] would tell you). Presumably, the reason this hasn't been addressed is that Google is willing to accept the extremely low impact of users having to re-enter their passwords to get to Google.<p>Incidentally, I am, like Egor, a fan of Rails. But to suggest that Rails is the most advanced framework with respect to CSRF is to betray a lack of attention to every other popular framework in the field. ASP.NET has protected against CSRF for as long as there's been a MAC'd VIEWSTATE. Struts has a token. The Zend PHP framework provides a form authentication system; check out Stefan Esser's secure PHP development deck on their site. Django, of course, provides CSRF protection as a middleware module.",1333153707

I get your point that the initiative and aptitude are the starting point, but as you mentioned,  looking for ""proof"" of ability is very tricky, particularly for people without much experience. Of course had I known I would be unemployed for 6+ months at the offset I could have planned a project that ticked lots of boxes (Django frontend, NumpPy, SQLAlchemy, PyMongo etc. etc.). I love the idea of Hacker School and wish I'd known about it at the time, I'm sure it would have helped me build a portfolio of work. While I did have some side projects I'd spend a lot of time learning to match a job spec or recruiters recommendations only to find the interviewer fixating on something else, other times I'd be strung along (""we'll be looking to hire in a month or so, why not brush up on X in the meantime?"") and then the job would disappear (cash-flow issues, change in priorities, new CTO decides to scrap Python and rewrite in node.js ;)<p>Ultimately I'd rather be programming. My current job is OK and I'll stick at it for now, I owe my boss for taking a chance on me and they'd struggle if I left before the end of the year (we are a small team and in the middle of switching accounting systems and finalizing an acquisition). I do like the fact that I get exposed to a range of business issues, as my previous job in the insurance industry was a little more technical but very narrow in scope. Long-term it probably doesn't suit me (though it might be different at another company), I've automated some tasks in Access/VBA but there is a line between finance and IT (partially outsourced or contractors) and I'm expected to use systems rather than improve them.

[1]<p>4) a visit to a page with a malicious resource construct (an image, script, iframe, external style sheet, or object). Note that this resource could be generated by JavaScript, although this is not necessary.<p>Sadly, the first three criteria are widely met. If we are to systematically remove this threat, then we have to look at removing each in turn:<p>1) Previous authentication to a service can be mitigated by simply logging out when you are done, but this is inconvenient and requires manual user intervention. However, there is an interesting possibility to limit ""important"" services to a separate process - a browser, an ""incognito"" window, etc.<p>2) Services should be built with an unguessable component that is provided just prior to calling by a known-good API, probably with additional referrer verification.<p>3) It is my belief that disabling third-party cookies is the right solution here: users rarely, if ever, get value from third-party cookies. Denying them would allow API authors to write simpler APIs that do not have a secret component, and would allow users to maintain the same behavior and login to all their services from the same browser.<p>4) While it seems that little can be done on this front apart from releasing some chemical agent into the atmosphere that made people trustworthy and good, actually it may be possible for browser makers to do some simple analysis of resource URLs to detect possible hanky-panky.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Privacy_and_third-party_cookies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Privacy_and_third-...</a>",1333152829

We're banking pretty heavily on assisted procedural content!)<p>I'm genuinely curious how much ""polish"" is actually needed and required by gamers.<p>My theory is that publishers have push the market to the point where games are very similar (not a bad thing in and of itself, but not inaccurate either) and so the differentiating factor for driving sales and advertising is visuals. That being the case, the increasingly far end of the tail of visual fidelity is being mined heavily, and ""polish"" is getting more and more and more expensive.<p>So, I think that you can get by on pretty solid gameplay and alright polish without needing to get a publisher to fund you--after all, it was their business model that made it so expensive to start with.<p>Does that seem like a reasonable conclusion?",1333152519

Essentially, you should choose a price based on the value you expect. For a simple overseas flight on which you just want peace of mind (that you're getting the best price), just go for the cheapest option.<p>At the other extreme, we've had a group of 20 people flying overseas, so paying $200 is not unreasonable in this case. We saved this customer over $10,000. One of the experts achieved this using an agent who had consolidated stock (discounted) directly with an airline. This price was unmatched online, so it made sense for the contest holder to get experts working to this level.<p>Appreciate the feedback; we're so far finding it a little difficult to articulate our variable pricing.<p>Some people just want to absolve themselves of the stress, some want the absolute lowest price, some want general advice, and others want complicated itineraries built using frequent flyer points. When we had all of those options set at different prices, people just got confused. :)<p>We'll keep iterating and get there soon. Thanks.",1333152380

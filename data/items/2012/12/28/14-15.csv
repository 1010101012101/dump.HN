If you took ALL of the money from the top 10% wealthiest people and put it towards the debt it would barley make a dent.<p>I actually did the math on this a few years back. Old data and I don't have the exact numbers we figured, but it was (roughly) that if you took the top 10% and taxed their income at 90%, and then took the bottom 90% and taxed them at something like 2%, and had no other forms of taxes, and no changes to spending, then the debt would be paid off within a single presidential term.<p>Please actually make sure you are informed before you go criticizing others for ""failing at basic math"".",1356706781

You don't even need to have your own money in order to make a dent--somebody working for a non-profit or trading company probably controls wealth far in excess of whatever you'll be able to scrape together. The value of money isn't even constant across regions: a pauper in the Bay could live like a king in Houston. From this we see that money is not a reliable yardstick.<p>A job, especially one for someone else doing something you don't enjoy, is just a way of accumulating money. If you aren't rewarded by the work, you are just wasting the reserve of hours you were given at birth. There's plenty that needs doing out there, and plenty of people that'll pay you for it. Even with a ""good"" job, you are not guaranteed respect by society: a lot of folks who do construction are viewed with contempt by people who've never tried to float drywall properly in their lives, and a lot of folks who design beautiful architectures go utterly unseen and unappreciated by the public who consumes their software. So, jobs are not a good measure of self-worth either.<p>Status is arbitrary and something that is accorded to you <i>by others</i>. Valuing yourself in that fashion is much like valuing yourself based on how popular with your preferred gender--it's something over which you ultimately have not the final say, and so makes you vulnerable to ""market fluctuations"". Status is just good marketing, one way or the other, and don't for a second conflate your perceived worth with your actual value as a human being.<p>~<p>In the end, you need to remember that the default case is still failure, and that in half a century you'll be dead, and in a century more more than likely completely forgotten.<p>This being the case, enjoy every morning and opportunity to try something new, put yourself out on the line, and go to bed each day secure in the knowledge that hey, you're ultimately free to play the game however is most enjoyable to you.<p>And don't worry about indicators that won't mean anything when you're worm food along with the people who would've judged you. :)",1356706631

4977870,comment,4945043,4945043,2,0,tblancpain,,,"The author is correct that app licensing is in its infancy, just like webfonts licensing was completely unstructured a few years ago.<p>Constructing this as some sort of malicious action of foundries is quite far from the truth, though.<p>In the fairy land of foundries, there's the great and unrivaled king  Monotype  and then there's a thousand princelings with a few princes (Adobe, FontFont) sparkled in between.<p>Type is a TINY market. In a back of the envelope calculation last year, I found that the whole type industry is generating around $120m  $150m in sales every year. Monotype/Linotype is around $50m of that pie already. Adobe Type is another $20m is I recall correctly. FontFont is a private company but I take their overall revenue is something like $10m.<p>Most other foundries are 2 men operations that produce a small profit but not enough to make huge technological investments like hand-hinting the complete back catalog.<p>At that point a foundry has three options:<p>1) Not offer their catalog for web- and app licensing at all. The respected resellers / foundry VLLG (Village, <a href=""http://vllg.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vllg.com</a>) does this currently, for example.<p>2) Offer them on request, with the possibility of having a conversation with the customer about their expectations and what they're really getting for their money. See the note in the sidebar on <a href=""http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/atlas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/atlas</a> as an example for this.<p>3) Offer them no matter what rendering quality on Windows devices they can achieve.<p>While horrible Windows rendering this does not apply to mobile app licensing due to better rendering engines and high-resolution displays on most current devices, it's still a large effort for most small foundries. Setting up the products in the e-commerce backend is the smallest part of that. And all that effort is a bet on (currently) a very small possible return.<p>And last but not least, one thing to understand is that most foundries make a huge percentage (60%+) of their money licensing large volumes to bigger companies. One corporate design may include office fonts for 500 workstations. While I personally love selling to small studios and startups that love our work, it's not what pays the bills.",1356706369

By changing those into an inheritance hierarchy I found a couple of places where clauses had been missed and so fixed some bugs, but more importantly when we needed to add new fill styles which were more complicated to draw it became very easy to turn the fill style objects into fillers which had all the responsibility for filling paths, not simply setting the graphics state.",1356706153

If anything, the if-then construct is a specialised use of OR, given than if-then-else is literally XOR.<p>Both are an implementation of the interface ""coalesce a value with null/0/false"".<p>I only mention this because it points to a lack of precision in our thinking which I see time after time get in the way of using OOP/OOD effectively. Maybe that's a failing of OOP, but I think that if it were, it'd be a failing of programming in general, too.<p>This helps explain why I teach OOP the way I do: start by following the rules of removing duplication and improving names, which encourages the programmer to ask ever-more-interesting questions about what tools are available to help follow those rules, which encourages the programmer to learn OO theory as needed, rather than having it shoved in their face all at once.

If that's how you feel, you're not alone and thankfully there are ways to break that mentality :)<p>When that happens to me, my best approach over time has been to pause for a moment, take a step back, and reflect on my situation. Realize that at 25, having $$, job, and status is actually ""quite an achievement"" that many others wish they could have accomplished as well. Realize many of the things you take for granted, like eating every day, having access to water, are a dream for some in other parts of the globe. Being able to afford what you desire for the most part (except maybe that Lamborghini), is a dream for many for many within the country. All in all, on an absolute scale, you're definitely in a pretty good spot and by no mean a ""loser"".<p>At that point, I usually feel better about myself. But that's only a temporary fix, because the underlying issues are still there. Rethink your priorities in life in terms of what provides YOU happiness. Forget about what society and movies make you believe priorities should be, and think personal. A quote I really like on the topic, from fight club, is:<p>""God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""<p>Now don't get me wrong, it is possible you genuinely have a personal goal to become a movie star, which would make you the happiest person on earth (but again, that's beyond the point). So think hard about yourself and what really motivates and makes you happy, and reset your priorities. Maybe it's worth not staying as long at work, fix that bug tomorrow, and go play that soccer game you've been craving for. Or maybe instead of spending an afternoon going to some event you don't really want to go to is better spent hacking away this fun idea you've been wanting to do for a while. Whatever makes you excites you, make it and priority and find time for it. The rest really is secondary. In my case, after a while I decided to make the bold move of quitting my job for another that pays less, where I work longer hours, but that is oh soooooo much more fun. I'm loving it and am super happy learning great stuff on a daily basis, and being payed doing what I like. We're all different, so it's up to you to find what your thing is :) Good luck, and I hope if you got this far my answer helps.",1356704946

Using visitors, you need a whole separate class for each unique function arity, or you have to use tedious little data carrier instances. Sometimes you want to switch between them half-way through the traversal, e.g. use your constant-folding visitor during an optimization visit, and the visual overhead of constructing visitors and keeping track of them, making sure they're all linked together properly, is really ugly. Don't even think about matching the visitor method on more than one parameter type, like you might do with e.g. overload resolution of binary operators. I've been there working on a commercial compiler, and I don't want to go back there again.<p>Haskell can implement the OO style using existential types (forall), a bit like Go's interfaces, except once you put a value into an existential type variable, you can't typecast it back out again.",1356704499

Don't forget!<p>* 304 responses strip out cache headers: <a href=""https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=104930&tstart=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=104930&#3...</a> Not breaking spec right now, but quite non-standard.<p>* I swear, I get 403s and other errors at a higher rate than I have from any custom store in the past. But this is purely subjective.<p>Based on all this- I really need to agree with saurik that the folks at S3 aren't taking their role as an HTTP API seriously enough. They built an API on HTTP, but not an API that browsers can successfully work with. Things are broken in very tricky ways, and I'd caution anybody working with S3 on the front-end of their application to consider the alternatives.<p>I'm moving some things to Google Cloud Storage right now, and it is blazing fast, supports CORS properly, and has read-after-write consistency for the whole service. Rackspace is going to get back to me, but I expect they could do the same (and they have real support).",1356703932

He also believed he was doing a great service to all who would participate and to society at large. In other words, his startup was both doing social good and creating value...<p>Here are Ben's words from his AutoBiography about the experience. \n""The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions, made me soon feel the improprietary of presenting one's self as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbors, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis'd it on such occasions;and, from my frequent successes can heartily recommend it.""<p>He continues, ""The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid.""<p>This very much reminds me of the plaque sitting on Ronald Reagan's Desk that stated, ""There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go If he doesn't mind who gets the credit.""",1356703483

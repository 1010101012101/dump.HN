2019108,comment,2016136,2016605,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"> Pain, yes. Fear, debatable.<p>They are two sides of the same coin. Pain signals go to several places in the brain: the sensory centers (""my toe hurts right here"") and the aversive conditioning center in the amygdala. The amygdala also receives signals from all over the brain, so when pain causes it to activate, it learns what was happening around the time of the pain. In the future, it will tend to produce an output signal that can activate protective programs elsewhere in the brain. In childhood, social activity wires it up to language and cognitive inputs too (""Did you get an ouchie?""), so that it can be used in all sorts of aversive behavior, not just avoiding physical injury. It's probably not a coincidence that social suffering is the language of pain: heartache, being stabbed in the back, etc.<p>> So most of the dangerous situations we actually encounter, we deal with using reason and learned behavior rather than fear instinct.<p>Most fear IS learned behavior; instinctive fears are quite simple. For example, <i>The Gift of Fear</i> [1] describes a man who walked into a convenience store, and for no reason he could explain turned right around and walked back out. Seconds later a cop walked in and was gunned down by robbers. Later the first guy replayed his memories and realized that the running car out front and the strange look the clerk gave him were probably the reason, but at the time logic and reason were nowhere to be seen. In fact the author of that book says that relying on logic is a good way to get yourself hurt. (Logical thinking has a very narrow range of focus in adults and easily misses hazards, but the amygdala constantly listens to the full range of senses and thoughts all at the same time.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Other-Survival-Signals-Protect-Violence/dp/0440508835/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1292655850&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Other-Survival-Signals-Protect-Violenc...</a>",1292656952

2019104,comment,2018292,2018292,0,0,emeltzer,,,"recently many places that used to be open wifi hotspots have become ""china mobile hotspots"" which are about one million times less useful.<p>example: starbucks in Beijing used to just be a WEP'd wireless connection, you buy a cup of coffee and they give you the password, allowing you to go online for as long as you want.  Now, you go online and are redirected to a horrifically buggy interface that requires you to input a China Mobile cell #, at which pt they will send you the login information as a text msg to your phone.  All sorts of whack limitations (4hrs max, if you get d/c'd you can only log back on 3x and you get dc'd frequently...)<p>It seems to me that this is very likely a decree from the govt, since wifi access tied to phone #'s is much less worrisome to them than anonymous wifi.  could just be a money grab by china mobile though.  in any case, I would imagine that these municipal spots will also use the phone # verification system, which totally undermines their usefulness.",1292656490
2019103,comment,2018594,2018594,0,0,dmlorenzetti,,,"<i>What is the use case for actually wanting to alter function parameters?</i><p>In scientific programming, you often need routines to change values in more than one data structure (basically because the routine's invariants relate physical values that are represented in different data structures, typically arrays).  So in a language like Fortran, where functions can only return one thing, you often call subroutines, passing in a number of mutable data structures whose contents all may need to be updated.<p>In case you're interested in more details on Fortran (take these with a grain of salt, since it's been a few years since I used it daily)... In general, if you pass in ""Type x"" you're really passing in what C would call ""Type <i>x"".  The language makes this opaque, and some compilers will actually copy in and copy out if [Type] isn't too large.  You can tag the ones that the function can't change with ""parameter"", which acts like the first ""const"" in ""const Type </i>const x"".  Subroutines allow you to change those arguments, but functions treat every argument as a parameter, and a conforming compiler should complain if you try to modify them.  Finally, modern Fortran also provides explicit pointers, though they don't act quite like you'd expect if you come from a C background.",1292656343

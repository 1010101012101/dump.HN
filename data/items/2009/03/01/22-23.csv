She's speaking to/of those who say that money is evil, love of money is evil, and related thoughts.  This seems clear from the very first sentence of the speech:  ""So you think that money is the root of all evil?""  Later, ""But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak?"", ""Or did you say it's the love of money that's the root of all evil?"", etc.<p>I would challenge you to cite the part of the speech or anything else Rand ever wrote arguing that money should be the most important thing in one's life.  The statement ""Money will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit,"" indicates what's more explicit elsewhere in the book, namely Rand's conviction that the material and (secular) spiritual are both of great importance in life and that neither trumps the other.  Rather, one should seek to integrate them.<p>Having read Rand extensively when I was younger, I can't imagine she'd consider your friend's approach to life, as described, anything but sad as well.",1235947965

The length of time depends on what it is and where its presented. It's tough to put a rule on setting expiration time.<p>Objects (users, pictures, videos, articles, etc.) are cached for 24 hours. We cache the row of results and rebuild the object from that. They are busted if they are updated, otherwise the data usually doesn't change.<p>Database result lengths depend on what they are used for. Anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours or days. Data that is requested more frequently (homepage) usually busts more frequently then say the user profiles page which gets far less attention.<p>Every section on our site is rendered in different views. These also depend on the frequency of use. The comments section of a video is cached for a short period of time. A recently released video is busting comments every few seconds or minutes as users comment on it. Something like the physical contents of an article can be cached longer, because once its written it usually doesn't change. It's pretty subjective.<p>We experimented with ""cache groups"". Which were collections of cache keys that were related. From there we could bust tons of related keys. We found the extra work of tracking the keys to not be beneficial for our site.

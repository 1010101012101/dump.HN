174737,comment,174101,174312,0,0,demallien,,,"Oh, I just realised that I didn't explain the most important thing - the difference between 'I see where you are coming from' and ' I see where you are going'.<p>The first is more of an acknowledgement that I have understood the premises that your argument is based on.  I may use this expression to indicate that I now agree with you, having understood your premises, or it may indicate that I am going to argue against your premises - 'I see where you are coming from, but your premise that we are losing market share as a result of the project is false - statistics show...)\nThe second (I see where you are going) is more a way of saying that I have understood the base of your argument, and I know what the conclusion is going to be.  Typically people use this to cut someone off before that person arrives at their (now redundant) conclusion.<p>My apologies to everyone else for spamming the list with this finer point of language, but as someone living in a country where my native language isn't spoken, I often wish that people would help clear up my misconceptions, so I'm doing the same thing for someone else.",1209278754

We made sure our prize was the highest on the site for a logo at the time ($500 in each case), and so we got tons of entries, quite a few of them very good.  We even got a goatse entry: <a href=""http://inthebox.webmin.com/its-just-not-a-contest-until-you-see-a-goatse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inthebox.webmin.com/its-just-not-a-contest-until-you-...</a>",1209278373

And, I really don't see how horrible programmers would be made better by poor techniques (which I believe some aspects of XP are).",1209277960
174727,comment,174575,174722,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Joe, are you a web programmer?""<p>Yes, by some definition of ""web programmer"".  (I work on Virtualmin, Webmin, and Usermin.  So, a large percentage of my work is back end systems management with a web front end.)<p>I've merely never committed the time to doing a project with LP.  Which is why I included a (yet) in my comment.  I'm not ruling out the possibility of some day falling in love with LP.  It just hasn't happened so far.  I think it's one of those things that requires quite a lot of up-front commitment to make use of, and so many projects start off as tiny ""throwaway"" projects and eventually grow large (or don't).",1209277752

Je viens de ""Googler"" 'en venir à', et pour chaque résultat sur la première page, il y a une phrase en anglais qui correspond utilisant 'come'.<p>Si je traduisait ton expression 'je vois où tu veux en venir', je le traduirais par 'I see where you are going', ce qui n'est pas du tout pareil à 'I see where you are coming from'.  En fait, pour moi, la bonne traduction de 'I see where you are coming from' est plutôt 'je vois ce que tu veux dire', où un truc du genre...<p>Mais bravo quand même.  Dans mon premier post j'avais oublié l'expression 'en venir' (sans le 'à'), où effectivement la traduction de 'venir' est 'to go'.<p>Anyways, hope that cleared things up a little...",1209277577

174722,comment,174575,174646,0,0,fa,,,"Joe, are you a web programmer?<p>I'm really interested in why people don't get LP because it was love at first sight for me, in theory at least. It'll help bridge the gap between writing journal papers that contain the theory and the code that implements/demonstrates the theory.<p>The other day I got some code (calculating and displaying the Cramer-Rao bounds on radar parameter estimators) written by one of my professors who gives stunning lectures and writes excellent papers. The coding style was straight from the 80s... think Fortran. I think that's because nobody ever had to read his code, so although he got great at lecturing and writing, he never got to practice coding. And I think LP will help avoid that and encourage people to combine documentation, code, and theory.<p>I think a very different set of constraints exist for web programmers and indeed for my own php/mysql-style apps, I can't imagine doing LP.",1209277402

174717,comment,174485,174637,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's amusing that you believe that a top five (probably #2) hosting provider that has had a competent cloud computing initiative for years (Mosso) is threatened by cloud computing entering the mainstream.  I'm not saying hosting isn't going to get more competitive...I know that it is.  But RackSpace has always managed to be among the fastest growing, most reliable, and highest margin, hosting providers in the industry.<p>I think you underestimate the growth that will continue to happen in hosting for the foreseeable future, and the strength of RackSpace in that industry.  Most of our customers (who are hosting providers) view RackSpace as a very serious competitor to be taken seriously on nearly every front.  And I'm not saying nice things about RackSpace just because we'd like to sell them some software.  They really have built an impressive business.",1209276262

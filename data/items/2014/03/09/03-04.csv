7367367,comment,7367176,7367322,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I&#x27;m a fan of the Midwest in general and love the seasons (even in MN) but I don&#x27;t know that the jobs are there. My friend in Madison (a very intelligent &quot;ABD&quot; who, as often happens in math PhD programs, burned out) got $45,000 in his first programming job because his company had no competition. Even now, I doubt he&#x27;s higher than $90,000.<p>As for leaving SF/Boston/NYC, I moved to Baltimore, which is not the Midwest and actually not that cheap. The two-body problem is a big part of why the &quot;star cities&quot; are so attractive. I like Baltimore-- it&#x27;s way better than its reputation, although that ain&#x27;t saying much-- but when I next search for a job, I&#x27;ll probably find more outside of Baltimore than inside. Also, there&#x27;s that two-body issue. This move has been good for my career but so-so for my wife&#x27;s, because there aren&#x27;t many good companies here. We shouldn&#x27;t have to choose between one career or the other and, in the long run, we won&#x27;t. The costs of housing in San Francisco and New York are fucking criminal (literally, if you look into the NIMBY issues) but knowing that both you and your spouse will be able to find high-quality jobs for 10+ years is the draw. I&#x27;d rather live in Minneapolis than San Francisco, but I&#x27;m pretty sure we could live in San Francisco, career-wise, for at least a decade. Are there going to be VP-level-but-mostly-coding machine learning positions in Minneapolis in 2024? Not a clear call. And cross-country moves are stressful and just get harder with age.<p>Of course, San Francisco and New York spit you out if you don&#x27;t become, at least in pay grade, Director-level by child-raising age. To be honest, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll move to either of those cities when we next relocate, because even though we&#x27;ll be able to afford it the expensiveness is horrible for the culture. We ranked cities independently and Seattle topped both of our lists; it&#x27;s affordable (if not exactly cheap) and beautiful and neither of us has a problem with 50-degree cloudy days. (In MN that was called &quot;Early May&quot;.)",1394337536

7367359,comment,7367176,7367322,1,0,bane,,,"If anybody wants to do a little virtual house hunting for no-coast housing, I highly recommend the show &quot;House Hunters&quot; (the International version &quot;House Hunters International&quot; is also great) on HGTV. They also have some similar companion shows like Property Virgins, Hawaii Life, &quot;Buying and Selling&quot; and &quot;Property Borthers&quot; and it&#x27;s pretty informative as to what local markets are like all over the place.<p>The format is basically the same every show, somebody wants to move someplace, in 30 minutes they give a brief description of what they&#x27;re looking for and their budget to a real estate agent. The agent then shows them 3 homes in the area. They pick one of the homes and then finally you see how they&#x27;ve moved in and decorated the place 2 or 3 months later. Along the way you get to see a little bit of the area they&#x27;re looking in.<p>The other shows have similar, but slightly different formats or spins on the basic concept. But House Hunters has the show format down to a concise science.<p>There are episodes where my jaw absolutely drops to the floor seeing how much house and property they can get for their money. For what my garage costs I&#x27;ve seen people get 2 floor 2500 sq ft homes with a detached garage structure and half an acre.<p>Of course other places are equally depressing and have pretty much destroyed life-long dreams to move to a nicer climate for retirement. However, House Hunters International has shown me some new candidates that look like they&#x27;d work very well on a retirement income.<p><a href=""http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv40/videos/index.html?xp=hh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv40/videos/index.html?xp=hh</a>",1394337259

For what they&#x27;re worth, here are my thoughts:<p>Your premise of chatting to nearby people is going to have an adoption-cycle problem. Not only do you need other users to have the app, but they have to be using it within proximity. If you can&#x27;t find a really good way to make userbase size a non-issue, you will have a hard time getting any installs. If you plan to use contacts-based messaging to drive the initial adoption, then the hyperlocal feature probably isn&#x27;t your primary feature anymore, so you should reconsider focusing your marketing on it.<p>You also have a user-safety issue when giving away location data, but that can be an opportunity to innovate in a differentiating way. Focusing on the trust constraint may open up ideas on how users would interact - the key (if your market is social) is to let people do something fun that they couldn&#x27;t previously do. Think about how trust factors into the interactions: for instance, if you invert it so that the message only goes to friends that aren&#x27;t nearby, how might that change the experience?<p>Don&#x27;t be discouraged, but do try to be really honest about the state of the product. Also, get a few people (a few more, if you have already) to sit down in front of the site with you next to them. It&#x27;s currently somewhat difficult to imagine what the experience would be like, and you want that to be clear within the first fifteen seconds (or so) of opening the page. Most visitors, when they get the first impulse to ditch, will follow that impulse.<p>Good luck!",1394336597

I looked at the FreeBSD and MIT licenses because of the fact that there is a subtle difference in the licenses which can cause some confusion: the MIT license explicitly allows sublicensing while the BSD licenses do not.<p>The descriptions were good.  The MIT description was exactly the way I read the license text.  The 2-clause BSD/FreeBSD license said &quot;you can do almost anything&quot; which immediately raises the question of &quot;what can&#x27;t you do?&quot;  My reading of the license is that the answer is &quot;sublicense&quot; (i.e. you can include the work in product of a different license, but you cannot change the license on the BSD code in the process of transmitting it, and that this limitation does not exist in the MIT license, were you can not only change the license but likely assert status as licensor when you do so).

I meant more that I could see if this person was contributing to other projects, or just generally what sorts of projects they worked on. Certainly, pay-per-LOC is not even remotely intelligent.

Most people don&#x27;t grow in their jobs alone. Most companies don&#x27;t want their employees to grow. Learning, trying, failing, and mastering take time that companies don&#x27;t want to spend money on.

7367324,comment,7365615,7365615,2,0,javajosh,,,"Funny, but rather over-stated. Yes, the js runtime is incredibly malleable, and people do indeed load code from everywhere. But there are important, universally adopted conventions that mitigate the risks: the biggest ones being: 1) libraries define a single global variable (or attach themselves as members of one of those global variables). 2) Manipulation of platform prototypes is strictly verboten. 3) Using === in preference to == everywhere.<p>The &quot;relentless asynchronous&quot; nature of the environment is a challenge but, I&#x27;d argue, it&#x27;s the right challenge. Async programming is actually a Good Thing because you&#x27;re only ever dealing with a single process, a single path of execution, all the time. It is possible to get this right, whereas with multi-threaded code, I don&#x27;t think it is, in general. It&#x27;s true that you can complicate matters by weaving closures in and out of each other to the point where it&#x27;s impossible to understand the state of your program by reading the source (or even with break points), but that&#x27;s just bad code, and shouldn&#x27;t reflect on the notion of async itself.<p>It really is too bad, though, that the runtime doesn&#x27;t (and can&#x27;t) offer better invariant guarantees, and that we have to rely on convention. But honestly, that sort of thing is possible in Java, for example, too. One of your dependancies can load up ASM or BCEL and start changing classes. Heck, Hibernate does this routinely. The only real difference is that the barrier-to-entry for JavaScript programs to do this sort of thing is much lower.",1394336097

The social links. Not only are they not necessary, but there appears to be a bug with the Facebook widget (Chrome 35, OSX) that causes it to be about 1000px tall and invisibly cover the entire &quot;Newest&quot; column, making all of them unclickable.<p>2. The expansion of the &#x27;rules&#x27; sections on hover. Not only is that information not really useful in that format (tiny text, difficult to read, too terse to be useful), the expansion makes it difficult to click on what you want. It may be best to either omit them or leave them expanded by default.<p>Thanks for a useful site!",1394334470

7367267,comment,7365812,7366829,2,0,mark-r,,,"The question is, why do APIs return 64-bit values? In general it&#x27;s not because they need all 64 bits, it&#x27;s because the 64-bit integer type is convenient for them. This might make Crockford&#x27;s proposal completely impractical but it doesn&#x27;t invalidate the argument that led to it.<p>I reject the nanosecond example because it&#x27;s completely arbitrary. 64 bits of picoseconds would only cover 0.584 years so should we claim 64 bits isn&#x27;t enough? Wouldn&#x27;t 2000 years of microseconds in 56 bits be good enough?<p>I&#x27;ll give you credit for bitboards though, that&#x27;s one I hadn&#x27;t considered.",1394334226

7367265,comment,7367137,7367230,4,0,JoshGlazebrook,,,"In my experience, return policies here have become more lax in regards to the time frame of when you can return something, and whether it needs a tag or not.<p>A recent example of this is when I&#x27;ve dealt with ASOS. Even though they&#x27;re primarily a UK based company, they offer free shipping and free returns here in the US (also something I see becoming more common). But on top of that, even though the return policy says within a certain timeframe, emailing their customer support about a month after the return cut off period, they told me as long as the item is in sellable condition I could still return it. They literally told me that &quot;Here are ASOS, we&#x27;re not monsters&quot; which I found kind of cute. But overall that&#x27;s close to the best customer service I&#x27;ve had in a while (return/shipping wise).<p>Going back to the free returns though. I feel like this is the last major pain point in online shopping that hasn&#x27;t been dealt with yet. Amazon for instance, returns are free by default on clothing and a few other categories of items. Items that are damaged, or something is wrong with the item that is not your fault gets free return shipping. But what if you just don&#x27;t like it? Well no free return shipping for you. I can&#x27;t imagine the amount of people that could potentially abuse a free return system could have any significant impact over the amount of profit and new customers a store could get from reassuring their customers that they care about if you&#x27;re happy with your purchase or not, and offering the safety net of free returns for your purchases.",1394334075

If you mention you had bad experiences with the feature, or whenever you used it it didn&#x27;t meet your needs, or ask if anyone knows a way to work around the limitations you are seeing, you&#x27;re pretty safe.  If you come out with a definiteive statement such as &quot;it has crappy subtitle support&quot; you are going to have your comment assessed differently.  You&#x27;ll probably get more votes, up or down depending on how many people agree or disagree with you, but that&#x27;s the nature of polarizing statements.<p>It&#x27;s not that different than speaking in person actually, except you don&#x27;t have to pay attention to the reactions of others to see how your statements went over (in aggregate).",1394334063

2557402,comment,2556590,2556705,2,0,geebee,,,"Sorry to respond to my own comment, too late for edits...<p>I want to point out that I'm extremely enthusiastic about majoring in science or engineering, and I think an MS program (especially an employer sponsored one) can be a great way to dig a little deeper into a field or get a background in a new discipline (ie., get an MS in CS if your undergrad was in math or physics).  In fact, someone with this background who gets a jd or mba almost has a superpower in those fields.  Hard Sci/Eng/Math is also just a great background to get out there and start a company or start doing high value work the moment you hit the workforce.<p>PhDs are a different beast.  Incredibly long training, often highly specialized, generally directed toward an academic career, even if alternatives are available, and kind of scary low pay considering the intelligence level and barriers to entry.  I'm not saying CS PhDs aren't employable in Industry at fine salaries, but are they more employable than someone with a BS who rocked it in the workforce for 10 years instead?  Are their salaries much higher than people who got professional degrees with shorter completion times and vastly lower attrition rates?  No way.<p>Anyway, I should acknowledge a distinction here - the RAND study is more about PhDs, whereas this article is more about general background.  Engineers may not populate government, but it's the most common background among fortune 500 CEOs, way out of proportion to the general degree population.",1305658339

Is US going to bomb China if the level of the attack is severe enough? Diplomatic efforts will fail pretty quickly if it genuinely isn't anything conducted by the Chinese government.<p>But hey, let's swap out the contentious example of China for Australia or France - is America going to bomb either of those countries because private citizens in those locations are pursuing a national cyber-security warfare-level attack?<p>If Al Quedia et al have taught us anything it is that we cannot assume national security attacks (and our defense strategies) to be state-sponsored any more.",1305658292

This is especially relevant in medicine and biology.  Many applications are constrained by small sample sizes and may have a feature count that is orders of magnitude larger than the sample count.  Examples include fMRI studies and gene expression studies.

You can see this even in the large Chinese and Indian communities here in North America. What has most likely happened is that the one child policy has simply enabled those cultural preferences in China much more than the exist in India.<p>It's also interesting that India itself has at several times flirted with restrictive population polices, including forced sterilization at right around the same time as China introduced their family planning program.<p>While that doesn't suggest that the one child policies are the <i>only</i> cause, I think there is enough evidence there to suggest they are a factor.<p>Nonetheless, all of this wasn't actually a real focus of my original point at all.",1305657467

It could collapse entirely; falling prices could scare people out of bitcoins, lowering prices further, until bitcoins become absolutely worthless. This can't happen with commodity money because it has intrinsic value -- e.g. if you have an iron ore currency (backed by a ton of iron), it is valuable as long as iron is valuable. You can always sell your iron-dollar to someone who only wants the iron it is backed by. And a fiat currency will remain valuable (as long as it's not diluted by hyperinflation) because the state requires its residents to accept it as payment -- called ""legal tender"". But bitcoins? They are a bizarre sociological experiment -- a pyramid scheme, an enormous speculative bubble in something that has no intrinsic value. Or perhaps negative value, since bitcoins are costly to ""create"" -- they consume large amounts of CPU time.<p>What cryptography (reasonably) guarantees is that bitcoins aren't double-spent, aren't created from thin air.

Add in MySQL after another couple of weeks and then iterate on the whole system for another month. That will give you the confidence to seek out the work that will be worth your time (after 2-3 months of really hard work).<p>Another point: Knowing how to program is a different job than getting side work/contracts and dealing with customers. Find someone to partner with you if you can - maybe give then 25% or 33% if they are dedicated to helping you manage customer relationships. Dealing with customers takes a lot of time away from actually programming and leads to burning out sooner if you are <i>doing it all</i>.<p>Lastly, network as much as you can.

Publishing only in French has downsides for readability outside France, but as you say, publishing only in English has downsides for readability <i>within</i> France. Most CS researchers and students I've met would prefer the English solution, mostly because they feel that, unlike in fields like philosophy or political science, the average French person isn't interested in reading their work anyway--- the only person who's going to read a theoretical CS thesis is another theoretical CS researcher. And in that case, they'd prefer the international community of theoretical CS researchers to be able to read their work.<p>Denmark is an interesting example of the opposite case: there are now graduate degree programs where you <i>cannot</i> study in Danish, because all courses and coursework are English-only. That's controversial to some extent, for obvious reasons. It does have some upsides from an international perspective, since Denmark can now hire researchers who don't speak Danish (which is why I'm in Denmark currently), and can also accept PhD students from other countries without requiring them to learn Danish first.

Migrating your WordPress blog to a new platform might be easy, but when you're managing hundreds of machines running thousands of packages that sort of change is not trivial.<p>Running ""time-tested"" kernels is not really the best advise either in this case. Xen is a fairly new environment, and EC2's implementation has some quirks, so there's a pretty regular stream of bug fixes and other improvements in recent kernels that are often worth picking up. If I went to Canonical with a ""time-tested"" kernel bug they'd tell me to upgrade before they'd give any real support.<p>When we talked to Amazon about switching to their AMIs they advised us that it was probably _not_ worth switching, that switching might not fix the problem, and that the AMIs we were running were widely used and supported. They made it clear that they work closely with Canonical and other providers to get high quality AMIs into their ecosystem. Long story short, the people who you admit know the most about the EC2 environment advised us that they weren't necessarily the best option, or at least not the only option, for good AMIs (sort of like how hardware manufacturers aren't the best option for an operating system).<p>So the answers aren't really cut-and-dry here.

I think there are a lot of variables at play, all of which need to be accounted for: wait time and hassle at commercial airports vs. private jet strips; minimal to no risk of delays; and so forth. I agree that corporate private jets hardly offer anything approaching a luxurious in-flight experience, but in those cases, luxury of in-flight experience isn't the goal. Rather, the goals are roughly a) mitigation of delay risks; b) ease of travel and convenience; c) provision of a sterile, noise-pollution-free, whining-baby-free flight environment in which to conduct business and get stuff done in the air.<p>An uber-rich-person jet, on the other hand -- assuming we're talking about one owned purely for convenience and/or vanity, and not for corporate purposes -- is a more luxurious experience, with luxury as one of the core goals. True, most of these jets are too small to offer the day bed or stewardess service you'd get in first class on a major international flight. But I'd argue that those benefits of commercial are outweighed by power and freedom to fly at will, private catering on the flight, etc. Also, the most comparable use case is private jet vs. first class domestic, rather than private vs. first class international. International fist class is where all the bells and whistles come into play. Domestic first class is a pretty unremarkable experience; it is debatably the coach experience of 10 to 15 years ago.",1305655987

Are people going to die if the anonymization is broken, or are the consequences relatively minor?  Are there ways to reduce the severity of these consequences?  To maximize the benefits?<p>I take a bit of issue with Pete's statement that Naryanan's break ""gave access to their complete rental histories"". Rather, it gave access to slightly munged ratings a for possibly partial subset of the movies included in the dataset.  While this is real, it's not quite the same as knowing their entire rental history.<p>To my knowledge, there was no damage done by this exploit: no one was fired because it was likely they loved Brokeback Mountain.  By contrast, the Netflix Prize brought about a lot of great research that otherwise might never have been done much less made public.<p>I'm glad the data was released, and the contest held, and I think in retrospect the benefits outweighed the potential risks.  I would hate for the conclusion to be that privacy must be upheld above all other factors.  I would hate for the outcome to be that no such dataset will ever be released again.",1305655652

It's definitely a tough nut to crack, as a website/app will never beat the convenience/accessibility of email.<p>Here's the biggest issue we ran into, which I'm not sure WhereBerry has solved either:<p>Let's say Julie wants to see Fast Five (ugh), and she wants to know which of her friends would like to attend. At first, she considers using WhereBerry, as it's designed for such things. But wait, Julie's friend Joe doesn't have an iPhone. And I know her other friend Steve doesn't use social networking sites besides Facebook. Julie resolves to just send an email out to everyone, so she knows she'll get a response from everyone she wants to talk to in one step. Plus, she already has everyone's email address.<p>See the problem? Julie is forced to isolate her non-WhereBerry friends, or invite some on WhereBerry, and others via email (huge inconvenience). This isn't solving the problem. It's compounding it. Let's say WhereBerry tries to ""solve"" this problem by allowing Julie to invite non-members via email. We tried that, too. While it sounds good on paper, nobody wants to send their friends an email saying ""Hey I want to go to this movie. Join WhereBerry to tell me your response!"" In reality, they'll probably text Julie saying ""Sure, I can go! Why didn't you just text me?""<p>It doesn't matter if 95% of your friends are signed up to WhereBerry. You'd need 100% to get people to use it in any consistent form.<p>It's not a tough problem to discover, as many products have attempted to solve it. But, no company has succeeded, specifically because of the scenario posed above. I wish WhereBerry luck, but I think it needs to solve the problem before being a ""cool plan-making utility.""

A third advantage he has is that he's largely working alone or in small volunteer teams.<p>A major source of ""unproductivity"" for applications programmers is rework.  A lot of rework comes from poor specifications and from the essential difficulty of creating user interfaces.  To get usable user interfaces it's generally necessary to try a number of things that don't work.  You certainly can build one prototype,  set a stingy budget,  and timebox it,  but odds aren't good that real people will actually stick with the product.<p>Another issue in commercial applications development is the NNPP's (Net Negative Productivity Programmers.)  You'll have one on your ""team"" or you'll be maintaining code written by one.  Either way,  they'll sap your productivity.<p>Adding up these unproductivity factors you can find 80% of your time disappearing...

If and when you disclose something publicly that reveals an algorithm weakness, ultimately what happens is people abuse the relevancy signal and then Google evolves their algorithm to place less weight on that relevancy signal. The other thing that happens is the cost of trying to influence that relevancy signal goes up. Some people have highlighted that in some instances domain names can be part of an SEO's strategy. Eventually that led to poker.org selling for a million Dollars!<p>Over time relevancy signals that are shared ultimately either become more expensive to create, less trusted, or both.<p>The other thing I would add is that you can know a good bit about what some of the signals are & it can still be a royal pain in the rear trying to create those signals. It is easy to write ""build links"" but search is a winner take most market & you can lose a lot of money marketing before you hit an inflection point. The same is true with brand building. And some brand building efforts are not entirely logical, but some are focused on exploiting the irrational parts of human nature.<p>If irrational humans create the relevancy signals you need and irrational idealistic humans write the algorithms that grade those signals, then just rationally looking at the numbers does not guarantee you will be able to compete.

In crowded cafés, this may not be optimal.

7539149,comment,7538314,7538806,10,0,scarmig,,,"Although that sentence doesn&#x27;t refer to it, something to keep in mind: there are the race and class variables lurking in there. IIRC if you&#x27;re upper-middle class and white (and Asian, I&#x27;m guessing), the gender gap disappears.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that we&#x27;re not failing our young boys; we certainly are. But it&#x27;s always useful to break it down by race and class, especially in the States.<p>A deeper question is why? If our culture is biased against boys, you might expect the gap to appear in all racial and economic classifications. My hypothesis is that we&#x27;re in the midst of a giant pauperization: technology is eating most real jobs. In recent decades, however, there&#x27;s still been a relative abundance of salaried jobs that require stability and organizational and interpersonal skills, which women, either by genes or socialization, are better at. So there&#x27;s a real difference in investment payoff for a woman to go to college than a man, given their existing skill sets [1]. So more women go to college [2].<p>For now, at least. Give it a decade or two and I&#x27;m predicting an even lower proportion of men and women both going to college, particularly those in marginalized communities whose labor wouldn&#x27;t be improved to the point that capital needs them to to make more real profits.<p>[1] One way to confirm that would be whether a man with a college degree makes less money than a woman with an equivalent degree. Which I think is the case but want to find a real cite for it.<p>[2] Another hypothesis: traditional male archetypes are falling by the wayside. Discarding those is a strategy people are using, consciously or no, to try to build up the interpersonal skills of men. I don&#x27;t know how to test this, however.",1396745932

7539115,comment,7538695,7538695,1,0,eranation,,,"I think it&#x27;s matter of personal taste, and depends a lot on which domain your project is in. (Web, mobile, desktop, scientific, big data, machine learning etc...)<p>My preference (since I do a lot of JVM work) and first recommendation is Scala, it has good libraries for all of the above, web, scientific, big data, and even Android development (and all Java / Clojure libraries you can find, as well as Jython, JRuby and even with Java 8, some Node.JS clone). Another reason I like it is that it let&#x27;s you write both in a functional style and in a object oriented style without compromising or enforcing either. (it gives you a nudge towards functional style when possible, but let&#x27;s you write imperative and OO code with the same ease). Cons - a bit long compile times (bearable for me) and some say it has a &quot;too complex&quot; type system, I think that for most programmers the type system complexity doesn&#x27;t really have any impact.<p>If you like dynamic languages, I&#x27;d try Clojure, it&#x27;s been very popular here and from the little I played with it I appreciate it&#x27;s simple syntax and way of thinking. As others have mentioned your background is mostly imperative / OO background and Clojure is a great way to venture into functional programming (especially if you need a JVM language)<p>If you don&#x27;t need a JVM language, try Haskell! (same reason - learn some functional programming paradigm for great good)<p>Out of the above 3 you can find paying jobs, but I have a feeling Scala will render more openings (though usually with Java experience requirement as well)<p>If you aim at Systems programming, I&#x27;d try d / Rust rather than C++.<p>If you want web orientation, Python and Ruby are a must (sorry) Ruby is a nice language once you let it grow on you, you&#x27;ll get used to the pipes.<p>If you are into scientific programming, Python, Julia and even Scala are good choices.<p>If you want to get a fast high paying job - depends on where you are located, if in SF, go with Rails, Django, Node, knowing the framework is as important as knowing the used language (Ruby, Python and JavaScript respectively)<p>If you are in Atlanta, stay with the .NET stack or pick up Java.<p>In NY Java will serve you well (also in SF, but perhaps in less startups and more Google / Twitter kind of companies)<p>I think Java is good to know even if you hate it, it&#x27;s everywhere (and with the new Java 8 it&#x27;s almost bearable again to code in it)<p>My last point is that the programming language is the least of a developer&#x27;s concerns. A developer needs so many more skills than knowing language X spec by heart. Things like SQL, Linux, Git, HTTP, HTML5, CSS3, Good design and coding standards (read the pragmatic programmer / clean code / code complete etc...) \nAnd most important - interview skills and other soft skills. \nAll of the above are way more important that the language of choice IMHO. (I&#x27;m sure you have all these, but I think that the impact of which language to go with next has much less weight in making you a great developer than what people usually seem to depict. E.g. I don&#x27;t see often a &quot;which soft skills should I pick up next&quot; or &quot;which general design book should I read next&quot;. I think it&#x27;s because programming languages are more interesting :) (at least to me) and simpler to define. They have strict rules, and you either like it or not. General programming skill and soft skills are so hard to quantify and not easy to explain I guess. But I work on myself to try and spend more time improving these, than learning yet another language.

I think the difference is in motivation and group dynamics.<p>An angry mob is motivated by fear or anger and doesn&#x27;t think rationally. It&#x27;s generally dangerous for both the actors in the group and the target. Also everyone can become part of a mob as it taps into our basic instinct. I think that a mob is formed when a critical mass of anger or fear is formed and resolved once the danger disappears.<p>This is in contrast with a protest. In a protest you&#x27;re trying to promote an idea and in that sense you will try to advocate, talk to people and expose your point of view in the hope that they will adopt it. You still have a group of people but who are motivated by solving a specific cause. More noble sentiments are at play like compassion and respect. A good example of that would be advocacy of free speech.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that you&#x27;re seeing something different happening here.

Taxpayer money to the Oligarchy & entrenched interests.<p>I disagree with the OP. Costs should not be externalized. Businesses should be responsible for the havoc that they cause. If they go bankrupt, then it&#x27;s fertile soil for more responsible companies.<p>What has happened as a consequence is more fiat money will be created to pay off such debts to the insurers. The insurance company should go bankrupt & the government should not bail it out. If that wreaks havoc on the markets, the markets should be corrected to account for this risk. It&#x27;s better than further hiding the risk by creating more money, further devaluing the national currency.",1396742670

7538980,comment,7537956,7538428,5,0,endianswap,,,"Your assertion that a game like Starcraft is built such that it makes cheating difficult is unfounded. Because Starcraft players both synchronize the full state of the game, even what&#x27;s in the fog of war to your opponent means that cheating is trivial. There are some trivial countermeasures here where if the two simulations differ it the two machines will quit over the desynchronization, so you can&#x27;t just spawn a million units, but you can have full map vision in a game whose rules are tied strongly to the notion of imperfect knowledge of the board.<p>I&#x27;ve worked anti-cheat (and written cheats) for several games, and there&#x27;s little you can do in the space of 1-on-1 games to prevent cheating(1), but in the space of 3+ player games the separate simulations can &quot;vote&quot; to remove the player who is cheating (in the desynchronization fashion as above), if you assume there are going to be fewer cheaters in games than legitimate players. Of course if there is any knowledge hidden by the client in its render/UI of the game then a cheater can always recover that data, which is why when you can build a client/server model not transmitting hidden data is the most effective strategy to counter cheating (for example don&#x27;t transmit entities the player shouldn&#x27;t be able to see.) This is often difficult, of course, for example if you want footstep sounds to travel through walls in an FPS, but a lot of low-hanging fruit that cheaters would want can be pruned that way.<p>1: The other (common) approaches are to detect the cheats and punish the cheaters afterwards (Punkbuster, Valve Anti-Cheat, Warden, etc.) or try to lock down the process and make it difficult to write effective cheats (GameGuard, or one trick Blizzard does is attach a second process as a debugger of the game process and IPC validation checks so you can&#x27;t directly/easily hook into the main process.)<p>Edit: I now realize you mention hidden data still being recoverable, and desynchronization as a method to combat cheating, I missed that at first but figure I&#x27;ll leave my post up anyways, even if only to emphasize that seeing the whole map is a <i>very</i> valuable cheat that has taken players easily into the top of the Starcraft ladder (and the top of the Grandmaster rank in Starcraft 2).",1396742551

7538975,comment,7538695,7538695,2,0,csense,,,"Ruby and Python syntax are quite different.  Ruby syntax seems designed to be difficult to learn.  It uses obtuse, non-standard, irregular syntax for common operations, requiring constant consultation of the manual for the beginner to see any non-trivial program as anything other than line noise.  For reasons I do not really understand, Ruby is quite popular with HN users and I may actually receive downvotes for what I&#x27;ve said so far.<p>Python&#x27;s syntax, by contrast, is simple, intuitive, and fairly standard.  Python does have a few innovations over other languages -- the most important that come to mind are indentation-delimited blocks [1], tuple unpacking, list comprehensions, generators, args/kwargs, and access operator overloading.  All of these are usually optional in your own code and easy to grok when you seem in others&#x27; code.  When you are ready to use these syntax elements, you will find them easy to learn and quite practical in a variety of situations.<p>Python code can be concise without being unreadable.  This greatly improves developer productivity, which is very important.  Most projects are bottlenecked by developer time.<p>Python is a truly general purpose programming language, with excellent library support.  People can and do use it for command-line utilities, web applications [2], math/science [3], and desktop applications [4].<p>[1] Using indentation to delimit blocks is a controversial &quot;innovation&quot; of Python.  I suggest suspending judgment until you&#x27;ve written at least one medium-sized program in Python.  As a matter of coding style, usually programs written in high-level languages also use indentation to denote blocks; when this indentation gets out of sync with the rules the language actually uses to delimit blocks, you can get hard-to-spot bugs like this one:<p><pre><code>    if (myflag);\n        myFunction();\n</code></pre>\nThis will compile, but the if statement is a no-op, and myFunction() will always be called, which is probably not what the author intended.  The above bug cannot happen in Python; since Python actually uses indentation to determine blocks, by definition the indentation cannot get out of sync with the way the compiler/interpreter sees your code.<p>[2] For Python webapp development, I recommend writing a simple webapp with Flask first, then adding sqlalchemy for proper database support.  Once you&#x27;re comfortable with that combination, you&#x27;ll want to switch to Django.<p>[3] Try Sage, IPython, numpy, and scipy.<p>[4] I recommend GTK+ for desktop apps, especially on Linux.  <a href=""http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/</a>",1396742459

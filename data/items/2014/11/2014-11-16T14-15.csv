You can verify this yourself using basic network analyzer tools (I used nettop on OSX) to check the destination address of packets. Multiple times over the last couple of years (after they allegedly moved away from P2P) I verified that a voice call between Skype instances on Mac and on Windows was direct between my network and my peer&#x27;s IP address.<p>I did <i>not</i> check if IM traffic is P2P.

Moreover, the notion that science funding could ever be objectively &quot;fair&quot; is complete hokum, and the idea that a political apparatus could find a particularly fair solution is even crazier.<p>Of course, I have to disclaim that I ran a successful science crowdfunding campaign (<a href=""http://pledge.indysci.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pledge.indysci.org</a>).  As to why it couldn&#x27;t be funded by taxes, it&#x27;s because the NIH coordinator for the subsection working in the division that would have funded it used to lead the project I&#x27;m continuing so there&#x27;s a conflict of interest.<p>Now, this is a relatively &#x27;boring&#x27; and particularly coincidental reason for the inability for taxpayers to be able to fund this project.  Usually the real reasons are internecine conflicts within sciences competing for funds, personal differences, political connections, etc.  Consider for example the case of Leo Paquette, who denied funding to a group and then turned around and stole the idea for himself.  (ScienceWeek. 1998-03-20) Of course the system came to a settlement whereby Paquette got a slap on the wrist (agreed to not accept funding for 2 years) instead of kicking him out.<p>My personal opinion is that if people want to say they fXing love science, then they should be willing to reach into their wallets and pay for it themselves.

For example, a college which only teaches undergraduates is unlikely to subscribe to the specialist journals, even though a couple of the professors will be interested in those topics. (One common solution is for, say, the chemistry professors to get a personal ACS membership, which gives access to a limited number of ACS journal articles per year.)<p>There are researchers at companies. There are researchers with no affiliation. Many have an issue with paywalls even though you haven&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m a self-employed software developer in cheminformatics who also does research in the history of the field. I can do this because the local(ish) chemistry library has most of the papers on paper in the basement. It&#x27;s a public library, supported by my taxes. Otherwise it would be very expensive to get copies of the hundreds of papers I&#x27;ve read or looked through.<p>As an example, one of the papers from the 1960s has information I wanted in &#x27;figure 2&#x27;.

When I was a kid my mom&#x27;s non-stick lasted for years, until the handle breaks off or something, but they&#x27;ve done a lot of coating engineering work to increase repeat sales for non-stick.  So maybe a decade ago I switched to cast iron in a rage at my latest pan only lasting a couple months.  I was shocked at the cost, I was trying to buy upscale to get non-stick pans that don&#x27;t suck, and instead of paying $100+ for a six month lifetime non-stick I was paying like $15 for a lifetime grade CI pan.<p>I do understand how non-stick pan mfgrs stay in business, because they&#x27;re guaranteed about two sales per year due to amazingly low product durability.  I have no idea how Lodge and the others stay in the CI business because the pans last forever.  Its a mysterious business model.<p>One more point to add is I have CI grates on my charcoal BBQ and a similar seasoning mindset applies to CI grill as to frying pans.  Dump the coals, scrape/scrub the grates, apply some oil/crisco while it&#x27;ll still smoke a little but not too much, you&#x27;re good.<p>Another non-stick alternative I cook with a lot is stainless steel.  If you&#x27;re generous with the oil and keep the temps very high but not too high and start with a surgically clean pan, you can fry in stainless.  &quot;Barkeepers friend&quot; is the best thing I can find for cleaning stainless.  Stainless is also basically eternal.  Unlike CI, if you&#x27;re used to spending $50 at Target for a non-stick pot or pan, a CI equivalent will be like $15 but a large stainless pot could be maybe $100 to $150 for all-clad?  I&#x27;m in the &quot;all-clad or nothing&quot; tribe of stainless users, there are cheaper alternatives.  I like a steak in a nice near red hot stainless pan.  You&#x27;ll need the &quot;barkeepers friend&quot; cleaning powder after that.  I could imagine that powder would strip a CI pan pretty well, given how well it strips baked on stuff off stainless pans.",1416146540

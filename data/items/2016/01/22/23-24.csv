Also, can we make home electricity generation cheap and simple enough so that non-experts can figure it out?  How about home production of auto fuel, such as ethanol or biodiesel, based on something you can grow in your backyard?<p>I&#x27;d be focused on cheapness, ease of setup, and ease of use with these challenges.

And besides, it was really only a handful of field battles they won so spectacularly (not just due to the longbow, but due to a more comprehensive strategy involving longbows together with knights on foot and good defensive terrain).",1453503866

It also hypothesizes that there are similar challenges that immigrants and lower income folks go through.  Commenters on the post resonate with it, so I think it definitely exists despite another segment of the same economic population also existing that may not share similar challenges.  Whether these challenges are more prevalent on the lower income segment of the population or immigrants versus the general population is up to a broader study. The article sparks the conversation with his post though, so I think it&#x27;s worth giving it the respect of sharing it with the public and the possibility (as validated by a few comments already) that it may in fact also be a shared experience by a percentage of lower income, immigrant populations.",1453503661

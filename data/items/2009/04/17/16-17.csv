567246,comment,566122,566964,0,0,derefr,,,"I think dialog boxes are simply mismatched to the WIMP paradigm: the user expects to be able to click, navigate, and <i>explore</i> a problem space, when suddenly you're confronting them with a decision that, once made, disappears and cannot be re-made a different way: the antithesis of explorability.<p>If, instead of indivual windows, there were some central ""conversation window"" where the computer would ask you questions, then leave both the question and answer available for viewing and correction, things might improve. In fact, more things could be presented to the user as ""beneficial, but not necessary"" decisions to make (changing preferences from their defaults, etc.) This scheme reminds me of SimCity's Advisors window, oddly enough, and also bears a similarity to Windows 7's Action Center.<p>The biggest difference is that every decision would now need a ""safe postponement default"", in case you don't ""check your messages."" In the elevation case, programs would have to be rewritten to not expect to be elevated as soon as they ask for it, but rather try to do whatever possible with the priveleges they have, and then queue up a list of things to do if/when they get elevated (which may never happen.) for instance, under this scheme, Installers would always install to a user-writable location, then queue a move operation for post-elevation.<p>The 20% that takes 80% of the work, in this case, is figuring put what to do when the user works outside of the elevation framework: what to do when you move the folder the program was waiting to move, or what to display in the conversation transcript when you change a preference in the Preferences window that you originally chose in the context of a Conversation.f",1239987480

567173,comment,566557,566575,0,0,RobGR,,,"Your analogy is more wrong than right.  It is right in the sense that ordering from a menu at a restaurant can be a kind of code, but it is really just a subset of the common language useable by anyone.  If you don't understand what you will get when you order, don't order it, because it might be crap; ask them and they will tell you what it is, in whatever common language is used in that restaurant.<p>A contract is a ""meeting of minds"", and the minds are the minds of the parties not the minds of lawyers and judges.  If the parties can't understand it, it is not a contract, any more than the signature of an Alzheimer's patient is valid, and signing something not clear and plain is a bad idea.<p>In the Anglo-Saxon/British-American/Western/Modern or whatever you want to call it system of law, we do not have specialized codes that require experts to be intermediaries between parties to a contract.<p>Humanity has experimented with the specialized code / scribe / clerk way of doing law.  Often when an advanced society does not have widespread literacy, there is a specialized class through which all legal actions must flow; but as the aphormism says, ""the life of the law is in experience not logic"", and however appealing to technical people those special codes and classes of experts might be, experience shows that the code / expert societies are replaced by the common language / accessible court system.<p>Enough bullshit philosophy and history: here's some actually useful advice.  Collect example, well and simply written contracts.  Start from example contracts in the Nolo publications or books like ""Legal Forms for Everyone"" by Carl W. Battle (ISBN 978-1-58115-451-1).  If you have business contacts who have done similar contracts, ask them for a copy that you can use as a template.<p>After all, that is all the high-priced legal firms do.  They have their collection of cribs of previous documents and they re-work and re-combine as needed.<p>This is not to belittle the legal profession or suggest you don't need a lawyer.  Simply because you can express something in simple clear language and both parties agree, does not mean it will hold up in court or that it is a good idea.",1239984522

And please, let me know when I can link not to your invite-only beta program, but to your cool, slightly buggy site available to everyone - now.</i><p>This is pretty much exactly what I did when I was starting my website.  Instead of locking everything down, as soon as I had a reasonable working beta, I opened it up for free to anyone that happened along and wanted to sign up.  Because I didn't advertise, most of those early free signups were either referrals, or random happenstance.<p>Personally, I think as soon as you've got a reasonable working beta, you might as well open it up and let people try it out.",1239984478

2671198,comment,2671165,2671165,0,0,orijing,,,"Companies can sue you for anything. The question is whether they have a case that involves taking your ownership of your startup. Have you been making minimum payments (at least) on your credit card? If so, they won't do anything about it. Otherwise they will probably, at some point, throw you to the collections agency.<p>The IRS is tougher, since not paying your taxes is a felony. I suggest you do everything you can to pay your backtaxes as soon as possible.<p>And yes, of course your personal situation is a liability. Investors, should they become aware of your situation, will know that the first $50,000 or so will sink directly into your bank account, NOT the company. Therefore, your startup will have to be very compelling or the terms very good (to them) in order to make up for it. This is in addition to the signal you send, since managing scarce resources (money) is a critical skill for running a startup.<p>Good luck.",1308502738

Google Trends, StackOverflow questions, number of GitHub projects, average followers/forks for popular Django/Rails extensions, number/popularity of significant sites built with each, and the number of stories I see pop-up on sites like HN for each framework are all relatively equivalent.<p>Django for AppEngine is barely a variant, it's just a different handler for the ORM to interact with the non-relational backend. Jinja's a template engine that you can plug-in on top of Django if you want (like if you wanted to use HAML instead of ERB). Plenty of Django devs choose Tornado for their COMET needs (I know of almost no one that uses it as their entire web stack). Flask and Bottle are nice micro-frameworks, but aren't well-suited at all for large sites unless you feel like doing a lot of extra work yourself. Jekyll isn't a Python project, it's Ruby's static site generator (but does have a Python port called Hyde). Pylons (now Pyramid) is the only significant contender to Django. Think of it as Sinatra's market-share compared to Rails.<p>So when you actually compare the two, Python has no more ""framework fragmentation"" than Ruby.

I collected as many scores I could, without the preselection bias that you find with metacritic.\nIndeed, I do not take into account ""individual scoring systems"" that various reviewers used, although I did note whether they used a 0-100% scale, or 5 stars. \nThe bottom line is, many a reader will look at the scores to decide, even if you feel that is not the case. Also, reviewers that only use 65-100 are basically incompetent. Use another system if you are not going to use the rest of the scale anyway, or - if you think the actual text of a review matters only - just don't use any scoring system at all.<p>I present the raw objective scoring data, and these data indicate there are two bell curves possibly, and those bell curves prove the interesting point. I don't care if you project whatever I feel about the game in question on the validity of the data, because that's just nonsense. The data was collected without selection bias, just gathering as much as possible given the timelines. The only thing that matters is that we felt there was something amiss with certain reviews based on our own experience of this game in particular. From then on, it was a tool to expose certain reviewers for showing incompetent behaviour. You can rest assured that I don't care whether DNF sells or not. I do care when reviewers at major sites show questionable conduct. DNF is the tool, from then on we will watch them, also in retrospect. Bad reviews can make or break a game in certain cases, and this kind of power in the wrong hands is not to be tolerated.",1308501020

This body of knowledge is imperfect and so periodically people challenge it, making predictions where they hope their theories will be right and the standard model will be wrong.  The thing is, there are many more ways to be wrong than to be right, and the large majority of people trying to challenge established knowledge are wrong.<p>Because of this we generally ought to use commonly accepted views until people challenging them can point to ways that their theories can make predictions that are superior to accepted theories.  New theories might be intuitivly appealing, but if they can't pull their empirical weight they shouldn't get anywhere.<p>In fact, my reading of George Robinson's theory is that it would predict that the US economy would be much more unstable after going off the gold standard, when in fact it tended to be more unstable before we did.  Now, if his book actually did predict ""fewer but worse"" recessions maybe we should look into it, but I'm worried that it doesn't.",1308500440

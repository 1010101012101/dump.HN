This in turn enables arbitrary operations because you can express any function (i. e. any chain of atomic operations) by means of additions mod 2 and multiplications mod 2 (which is equivalent to XOR and AND) when you turn it into a boolean circuit representation. The contribution of FHE is a way to a) clean operands from noise or to b) do not add noise to the operands in the first place because noise is the limiting factor for circuit depth in HE, where &quot;depth&quot; means the number of possible subsequent multiplications.",1400849936

When you buy a house, you tie up major assets and take on a huge debt load. This provides a massive constraint on your life. You&#x27;re less likely to take on a risky job opportunity, you&#x27;re less likely to move for a good opportunity, you&#x27;re less likely to purchase other things you enjoy, and you put all your eggs in one basket. On the last point, as Americans should know now, real estate is not a sure holder of value. You can easily lose 50-100K if you need to sell your house to move somewhere else but there are no buyers.

I have a LOT of shoulder-length hair and I&#x27;m just not sure if I can clean that amount of hair with just water and no soap.<p>> I tried the no shampoo thing some years ago (my hair was shorter), my then-girlfriend did in fact comment (after I tried it for at least a couple of weeks) that my hair was more greasy (it was definitely not &quot;much nicer&quot;). Got a bit of irritated scalp too. I didn&#x27;t feel very clean either, as if I was just smearing the hair-grease onto the rest of my body in the shower.<p>Most people find best results with still occasionally shampoo-ing, usually a couple of times a week. Doing daily shampoo will strip your hair of its own chemicals and oils which is damaging in the long run, but for a lot of folks not shampoo-ing at all can cause issues with dandruff or scalp irritation.",1400849723

7789089,comment,7787851,7788004,2,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I think Xcelerate meant polynomial - which is an exponential improvement. It is not known but strongly believed that quantum computers cannot solve NP-complete problems. Be wary of anything that has &quot;quantum computer&quot; and &quot;exponentially more powerful&quot; in the same sentence.<p>It is not yet know whether Quantum computers can simulate all physical systems - though probably better than even odds for - perhaps some exotic physics might underlie some systems (on the other hand it is not known if quantum computing is even needed at all for physical systems, though only a handful have this doubt). But QCs should be able to simulate many kinds of systems, and even before full quantum computers we might get useful systems that simulate particular classes of Hamiltonians.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough physics to grasp all the details but simulating a system involves preparing a state, evolving the Hamiltonian and reading out the result. Preparing the Hamiltonian can be done in time polynomial of the size of the system (I don&#x27;t know anything more exact) and depending on the details of the system (local, sparse) and method in use, evolution can be as fast as linear in the size of the system (and though no general method allow sublinear calculation, particular hamiltonians could well admit such a speedup). And although, in general, non-sparse systems can&#x27;t be simulated in polynomial time there should be methods that allow reductions/decomposition into simpler problems.<p>There also other caveats: reading out the result requires a lot of sampling and error correction is a thorn. All these are why quantum computers are not some magical device - they&#x27;re much too finickity, and to be preferred mainly as a last resort. They&#x27;ll be pivotal for chemistry and to biochemists, pharmacology, material science and solid state physics (so better classical computers) but it seems hard to find any utility in general computer science.<p>--<p>Even if the difficulty of general QC algorithms is from the failings of human intuition, that still suggests to me that methods like inductive or genetic or automatic programming will easily outperform humans.",1400849704

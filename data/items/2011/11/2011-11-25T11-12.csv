From what I see, the web-cam view doesn't seem to contribute to the depth data (firing up the streams and viewing them shows different perspectives and there isn't any way to query how far a pixel in the web-cam view is from the camera).<p>I remember reading somewhere that the depth sensor projects something (infra-red?) on a surface and then the transformation of the image is used to build the 3D model. So it might still need some specialized hardware (not necessarily MS hardware since Asus seems to have a similar device out in the market).<p>EDIT : NVM I just looked up the video of Andrew Ng's class where they discussed this.

3276835,comment,3276653,3276809,3,0,mbesto,,,"Which is why their business model is now flawed. If you look at what a music publisher actually does. From wikipedia:<p><i>""In the music industry, a music publisher (or publishing company) is responsible for ensuring the songwriters and composers receive payment when their compositions are used commercially. Through an agreement called a publishing contract, a songwriter or composer ""assigns"" the copyright of their composition to a publishing company. In return, the company licenses compositions, helps monitor where compositions are used, collects royalties and distributes them to the composers. They also secure commissions for music and promote existing compositions to recording artists, film and television.""</i>[1]<p>So basically the publisher is getting money (a large portion of it) to make sure they get paid and provide contract negotiations. Spotify can easily (1) ensure the artist gets paid and (2) provide negotiations (you get X for Y amount of plays). The excessive overhead of the middle man is unnecessary now. IMHO, recording labels should just provide artists access to studios/producers/etc and become glorified marketing (music specific) firms. Also it might still be interesting for publishers to collect royalties for things like tv-ads, inclusion to movies, etc. But to the mass public it's a service that's no longer needed.<p>Lots of business models are built on assumptions. The assumptions have changed.<p>[1]- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_publisher_(popular_music)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_publisher_(popular_music)</a>",1322220242

You never intended to set anything straight (or you'd have done this in your previous comment instead of going for the pithy implication) and never intended this to be a discussion.<p>> Sorry it didn't work out.<p>It's not a relation, there's no ""working out"" to do.",1322218903

It is a great concept with a great deal of potential (basically any domotics application) and it will probably have a large potential user base.

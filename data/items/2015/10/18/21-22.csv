Do I put it in one module (to make it easy to change both if I need to) or in separate module (to make business logic more easy to follow).<p>2. &quot;Data structure dimension&quot; I can have functions operating on different data structures like lists and sets.<p>3. &quot;Operating dimension&quot; I can have functions operating on &quot;Enumerables&quot;. Do I put <i>map</i> in the Lists module or Enumberable? I need to know, where someone else put it when debugging. Database operating on meta data would solve that problem.<p>4. There can be metadata for time/space complexity, so I can easily make tradeoffs between functions that do the same thing in different ways.<p>5. &quot;prod/stg/dev dimension&quot; is another one. Maybe I want to use completely different logging mechanism for stg and prod, because I pay per logline...<p>6. &quot;Quality dimension&quot; could show, what is the code coverage for the function or if it follows naming conventions/practices.<p>7. &quot;Popularity dimension&quot; could show, how often is given function referenced, which would show most important functions and where to focus on optimizing.<p>Some of this problems are solved in different ways. IDEs can jump from function usage to its implementation. If you follow conventions, you can jump to a test code for given function. In Elixir, you can jump to protocol implementation. I can use inversion of control for switching implementations between environments.

It&#x27;s their complete least favorite part of the job.<p>The difference is that managers are typically under more constraints than engineers, and then entrepreneurs are under both more constraints and more uncertainty than managers.  As an engineer, your job is to make the machines do what your boss wants them to do.  You may have many technical constraints, but you basically have only one human constraint: what your boss is asking for.<p>As a manager, your job is to keep the team functioning and keep <i>your</i> boss happy.  If your boss says that your budget has been cut by 40%, there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it, you&#x27;ve gotta let 40% of your people go even if you really like them and they&#x27;ve shown you nothing but loyalty.  If you&#x27;ve got a brilliant technical contributor but he&#x27;s socially abrasive and half your team&#x27;s threatening to quit if you don&#x27;t get rid of him, you can fire him or you can lose half your team.<p>As an entrepreneur, your job is to a.) identify why the company should exist b.) hire the right people and c.) make sure that there&#x27;s always enough cash in the bank.  And if you have to lay people off, it means <i>you</i> fucked up.  But you do all three of these things under conditions of extreme uncertainty.  Maybe the technical rock star that shined brightly in the coding interviews is a douchebag to women, and you have to fire him so that you don&#x27;t lose every woman on your team.  Maybe you hired in anticipation of growth, so that you don&#x27;t burn out people, but then the market for your product turned out to be much smaller than you thought.  Maybe you hit a recession and your whole sector contracts.<p>Remember that entrepreneurs are ultimately responsible to customers, and <i>customers</i> show zero loyalty.  If a better product comes out, or they hit on hard times, or they change their line of business, they have no obligation to keep paying for your product.<p>Trust and loyalty absolutely play a big role in the software industry today, but business is a lot more complex than it seems when you come out of college, and you learn quickly that you can&#x27;t always do what you want.",1445204388

While I wouldn&#x27;t expect this of anyone&#x27;s one-off RPC protocol, the frameworks like OTP, specifically made to cleverly handle OOP RPC stuff, <i>should</i> be capable of multiple levels of &quot;formality&quot; in how objects speak to one-another, where an object that e.g. repeatedly sends messages to a named service should be <i>eventually</i> JIT-optimized into one that grabs the PID of that named service and messages it directly. Of course, if that named service dies, the process will crash—but like any other JITed code, that&#x27;s just the point at which the JIT abort-traps back into the un-optimized codepath and re-runs the function. This can be generalized to an arbitrary degree; you can go so far as to imagine e.g. distributed Erlang nodes that pass bytecode to one-another and gossip about code-changes, in order to be able to JIT-<i>inline</i> remote (pure) function calls.",1445204385

Take a look at the development of the cerebral cortex and how cells must travel through other layers to reach their destination. It appears that they are targeting telomerase which is very interesting and parallels cancer where its over-expression is used often as a marker. But then again telomerase under-expression can occur in early-stage cancer and is thought to contribute to genome instability/mutation to affect other genes before it is eventually over-expressed.

School centers around getting a job. But it&#x27;s starting to become not the only way to get a job. (Leaving out startups, of course; you don&#x27;t really need credentials there except to impress VCs.)<p>Some companies are recognizing that formal education in programming is not very effective, and are paying more attention to StackOverflow and GitHub accounts and that sort of thing. Our work and expertise is becoming more visible through the Internet. That suggests that maybe we&#x27;re not going to have to worry so much about credentials.<p>My older brother is doing very well for himself as a developer, without any formal training past some classes in high school back in the 90s. As for myself, I&#x27;m leaving for Kansas City once I&#x27;m done with my Associate&#x27;s degree, and I&#x27;m going to UMKC there... for a few semesters, until I find a job and/or a cofounder.

They let slip during my visit there that they&#x27;re already having issues convincing students to finish their degrees rather than let themselves be hired out.<p>But I do intend to go, in order to meet other programmers. That&#x27;s the real power of universities: they collect bright, ambitious people and let them work together. Online classes don&#x27;t have that power, and the credential problem is already being solved better, so I don&#x27;t think this is going to go very far. But maybe it&#x27;ll help accelerate the current solution by giving more credence to self-teaching and online study.

10409842,comment,10409660,10409660,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"BioViva is one of the small groups interested in bringing telomerase therapies to humans sooner rather than later. It seems they have started in on their small long-term trial of human gene therapy for telomerase activation, and have treated the first volunteer.<p>I should say that at any given time there is a fairly large gap between what can be done in human medicine, the technology that actually exists and works, and what is being done in trials. Most of this gap is due to regulation, and the rest of it because development groups want to have a reasonable certainty that what they are doing actually works, does more good than harm, and so forth. The regulatory process might last a decade, while the actually useful part of that testing (does it basically work, and is the risk profile sufficiently defined and acceptable to patients) is only a few years. As the cost of research and development in the life sciences falls, it will become increasingly untenable that a huge ball and chain slows progress thanks to regulatory risk aversion, and a growing number of initiatives will forge ahead and build anyway. Some years ago I proposed the Vegas Group fable, something that I think will happen in the fullness of time: alternative roads that bypass official regulation in favor of faster progress, an inevitability in an environment of low-cost research. Also, I think, a necessity.<p>What about the science here? I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of telomere lengthening approaches, as average telomere length as it is measured today in immune cells looks very much like a marker of the progress of aging, an end stage consequence far removed from root causes. Telomeres shorten with cell division and new long-telomere cells are delivered into tissues by stem cell populations. Thus average telomere length in immune cells reflects some combination of immune health and stem cell activity, both of which are known to decline with age. You can&#x27;t argue with the fact that telomerase gene therapy has been shown to extend life in mice, however, though you can certainly note that the size of the effect has been getting smaller as the research groups have refined their data and approaches.<p>How does this work to slow aging in mice? At this point I lump enhanced telomerase activity into the general category of approaches that either probably work or intend to work by boosting the activation of old stem cell populations, resulting in increased repair and tissue maintenance and thus a slower decline into frailty and organ failure. More telomerase doesn&#x27;t seem to raise cancer risk in mice, but mice have very different telomere dynamics and cancer risk profiles than we humans. The fastest way to figure out what is going to happen in humans is of course to try it, and kudos to anyone volunteering at this stage, but I&#x27;d be waiting for a few more years of testing first in animal or tissue models closer to human telomere dynamics. In part that decision would be driven by the fact that I don&#x27;t think that this is the best approach to move ahead with practical applications, to push ahead and get things done. I absolutely agree that pushing ahead to get things done needs to happen, but I&#x27;d rather see this sort of boldness for SENS treatments like senescent cell clearance.<p>------------<p>Digest of the Reddit AMA with the BioViva CEO: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3ocsbi/ama_my_name_is_liz_parrish_ceo_of_bioviva_the/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3ocsbi/ama_my_n...</a><p>I am patient zero. I will be 45 in January. I have aging as a disease. To take on this role myself was the only ethical choice. I am happy to step up. I do feel we can use these therapies in compassionate care scenarios now but we will have to work them back into healthier people as we see they work as preventive medicine.<p>The genes targeted are human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and follistatin (FST). In animal models neither FST nor hTERT have increased the risk of cancer. We expect to see the same result on myself, and to that effect we are measuring all known cancer biomarkers. The gene therapies on my body are to measure the effects on humans. There is plenty of animal research to support these gene therapies but no one was conducting human tests. We are using both visual biomarkers, MRI and a panel of blood and tissue testing including work on telomere length and epigenetic testing. We are collecting as much data as we can, but unfortunately we currently don&#x27;t have the coverage rate for this therapy, how much of the tissue of the body is affected. Depending on the tissue and vector used we ultimately expect to see similar rates of transfection as seen in mice, which is somewhere between 5 to 60%.<p>We are working as hard as we can to bring it to the world as quickly and safely as possible. We will will evaluate monthly and within 12 months we will have more data. If the results are good we hope to have something to the general public, that is cost acceptable, in 3-5 years. Our goal is to build laboratories that will have the mission of a gene therapy product at a reduced cost. Gene therapy technology is much like computing technology. We had to build the super computer which cost $8 million in 1960. Now everyone has technologies that work predictably and at a cost the average person can afford. We need to do the same with these therapies. What you will get in 3-5 years will be vastly more predictable and effective that what we are doing today and at a cost you or your insurance can cover.<p>We need a lab that works solely to bringing those costs down. We would need about $1 - 1.5 million to build one lab to focus on this. We can expand as needed. I would love to crowdfund this project but I do not know how to get good results at that scale - I think the price tag is high for that modality. We are raising investment to do offshore clinical trials. Many USA companies do this. If we can cut costs we will be able to bring back a treatment that people can afford.",1445203519

Modules and namespaces just add unnecessary cruft to the program text, are still prone to collisions, and are not globally unique -- hacks which do not actually solve the problem in the manner of Java&#x27;s com.xyz.whatever.SomeClass notation notwithstanding.<p>In the Burpit programming language, Poon, all functions are named according to a globally unique, 1024-bit hash of their representation in the Kock VM, which has been transliterated into a human-pronounceable string of CVC units, such as %pip-yod-rat-bag-hej-mig-wab-lik-sac-duf-top-kek. This is a bit hard to remember, but for the low introductory price of 100 BTC you may reserve a &quot;quark&quot;, or block of 32-bit function names such as %pip-yod-rat. We&#x27;ve eliminated the need for tools like git too: all publicly available Poon functions live in the Burpit network itself in a distributed blockchain database indexed by these hash names.<p>This means you have to give up human-<i>meaningful</i> function names, but in practice this has been shown not to be a problem: the Burpit developers have no problem remembering what %zoq-fot-pik does, and you can search on a function&#x27;s description in the global database.<p>There are some functions, called <i>traps</i> in Burpit, which are the equivalent of system calls and do not follow this convention.

This strategy seemed like a great idea at the time, but when I read the options agreement more closely I came across this section:<p>> (a) Repurchase Option. The Company shall have an irrevocable option (the “Repurchase Option”) following termination of Participant’s employment with the Company and any subsidiary or parent of the Company, for any reason, to repurchase from Participant or Participant’s personal representative, as the case may be, at any time, those Common Shares that Participant received pursuant to the exercise of the Option (&quot;Option Shares&quot;). Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company would not have issued the Option Shares to Participant absent the agreements contained in this Agreement and such agreements are a material inducement to the Company in entering into the Option Agreement and this Agreement.<p>I can totally understand why this clause is in the agreement. The point of giving out stock options is to strengthen the golden handcuffs.

So why is it problematic to assume she might have her finger on the pulse with regard to GitHub&#x27;s female employees?<p>Also, if you&#x27;ve &quot;been harassed by &#x27;leadership&#x27; at GitHub for two years&quot; why not stand up for yourself and put the jerks in their place, or talk to a lawyer? Why take to Twitter like a child and post a spate of accusations?",1394913563

Denying that there is an issue, or that the complaints of women like Julie are legitimate is part of the problem in the first place.<p>Personally I see a consistent pattern of low participation of women in the industry, and regular instances of women complaining about sexist treatment and not being taken seriously.

Especially the language learning method I have is much more strenuous than what most people use.<p>Here&#x27;s what I do: Obviously there are times where I learn the basics of the language and basic vocabulary. The main part of my learning effort, however, consists of watching movies/television.<p>What makes this so hard, is that I start doing so when I have only a very basic grip on the language, so that I understand very little of the language I&#x27;m trying to absorb. While watching, I force myself to actively try and understand/infer as much as I can. By this I mean that I touch my cognitive load limit.<p>When I&#x27;m &quot;fresh&quot;, this is realy exhausting. When I mix it with complementary strenuous work (say, designing a numerical algoritm), it causes headaches and slight nausea.<p>I want to stress that this method I use is not suitable for everybody and I&#x27;d really recommend against trying to do it for the first foreign language. The reason I resort to it is that I am more of a speech person than a written text person and I am also somewhat lazy regarding textbook language study.<p>It might also be useful to note that, while my method takes less learning time than using a book or working with a tandem partner, it requires much more reconvalescence. So my net learning speed might be on par or even slower than the speed of somebody using duolingo or doing an advanced university course.",1394912278

Like most nerds, the value of an hour of my time is such that even thinking about the price of paid streaming content is a waste of time, so Amazon&#x27;s paid streaming catalog is a great win for me; 9 times out of 10, whatever I want to watch, I can get through Amazon.<p>Amazon also does a better job of maintaining my library of past purchases and my wishlist than either of Netflix or iTunes.<p>I didn&#x27;t buy Prime to get the videos, but the videos aren&#x27;t s small feature.

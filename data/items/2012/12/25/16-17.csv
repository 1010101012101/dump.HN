Actual screen size is just as important as resolution in certain workflows IMO.<p>The sharable interfaces in every location option I think is further ahead than just a powerful tablet /w full docking options.

Even on the larger display devices the amount of information I can see without scrolling/swiping is a fraction of what I'm used to from iOS/Android. It leaves me with kind of a stuck-in-the-mud feeling that I'm just doing a lot of extra work to access the same amount of information.<p>This isn't something that even remotely occurred to me, as someone who moved from an iPhone 4S to a Lumia 920. I never noticed any difference, but now that I think about it and how my workflow has changed since I got the new phone, what you said couldn't be more wrong.<p>Just by unlocking the phone (button press + one swipe, same as iPhone) I can see emails (subjects and sender), text messages (sender and message), calendar events, and notification text (not just a numerical count) for every social network I have an account on. And that's just from the start-screen, without opening any apps or scrolling at all. One additional swipe down and I can see stock live stock information and news feed.<p>Getting all that information on an iPhone would involve individually opening and checking around 7 different apps.<p>And even if you ignore the information from the start screen, just from within apps, I'm not seeing any additional scrolling needed, or where extra effort is required to access information. Especially to a level that makes it so arduous that it disappointed you so much that you were compelled to complain about it on the internet.<p>Can you give specific examples of where all this extra scrolling and swiping that you're talking about is required?",1356454348

4966364,comment,4965868,4966070,2,0,krenoten,,,"Full disclosure, I work for an OTA and CRS (central reservation service) specializing in boutique hotels.<p>1. Often the hotels themselves charge the customer, and pay the OTA commission on a monthly basis.<p>2. Many contracts between hotels and availability services mandate that the hotel provide the lowest rate to the OTA, and that if they use several that the rates are in parity with each other. If you find a lower rate by going to the hotel directly, there's a chance that they are breaching contract.<p>3. The OTA can only be as accurate as the hotelier providing it with information.  If the customer is not satisfied, we get a partial refund or credits for future bookings.  For our more remote hotels, sometimes they have to throw up a satellite transmitter once a week and update the information they are telling the world about themselves.  If they are on a good CRS, it will fan-out that information to many online sites.<p>The OTA I'm at does provide the hotel with the customer's information, and requires that all communications between the hotel and customer are CC'd to them.  This is because when the customer calls our customer service with a problem, we want to know what the back-and-forth between them and the hotel was so we can address the issue more objectively.<p>Third party websites yield value to people who feel like being backed by the OTA's brand to ensure that they receive the experience they paid for.  They offer comfort insurance, and will go through the hassle of fixing problems with the hotel for you.  For hotels, the agency may also forward their information to google and bid on ad placement.  The one I'm at also guarantees certain perks to people who book through us, and offer a membership program for travelers to receive champagne on arrival, breakfast, transportation, etc... It sounds like you've really been burned by the lower end OTA's.  Sorry for the blatant spam, but maybe you'd be interested in TabletHotels.com",1356454304

4966336,comment,4966023,4966222,4,0,chestnut-tree,,,"I'm not the original poster, but I would recommend The Non-Designer's Design Book by Robin Williams. It's an easy-to-read book for <i>absolute beginners</i> in design. You can easily finish the book in one sitting - it's brief and concise. It discusses four design principles:<p><pre><code>  - Proximity\n  - Alignment\n  - Repetition\n  - Contrast\n</code></pre>\nEach principle is illustrated with before-and-after design examples, so you can understand how the principle works in practice. The book is very much about the layout of elements, rather than how to create an image from scratch.<p>The book also provides a basic introduction to understanding and using type. The type section is not as strong as the first section of the book that covers design principles, but still useful.<p>I'll repeat that this is an absolute beginner's book for non-designers. There are many topics it doesn't cover that you might find in a beginner's book on Graphic Design. However, it provides simple practical advice you can put to use immediately in documents. That's why I think it's useful for non-designers. Since it is a well-known and popular title, you should be able to find it in your local library.<p>(Note: my comments above refer to the first edition of the book published in 1994, but there have been subsequent editions which will have updated content.)",1356453635

We recently added in the ability to look multiple directions from a room and see a stitched 180-degree version.<p>We have about 3,000 hotels for which we have floor plans and views for mostly in the US and over 16,000 that have unique ""Insider Tips"" about what rooms are best in a hotel. We search 200,000+ hotels so that content is a bit hard to find right now and we're working on exposing it more. We continue to add more content daily.<p>Would love any feedback you have.",1356451633

I'm not sure if they are guilty of the same sins, but I've generally found their service to be adequate. I book directly with airlines when it makes sense and doesn't take too much effort - but most hotel booking sites are horrible and prices are usually higher.<p>It would be great if an open platform like AirBNB emerged for hotels - perhaps AirBNB itself.",1356451601

4966263,comment,4965868,4965868,3,0,coditor,,,"I work for an OTA and this is likely not Expedia per se, but the local office trying to up the value of their sales. Small hotels are always going to have more problems than a big chain, as they don't have any real time data connection to provide availability and room information. Either they send in their information and hope someone enters it correctly, or they are provided with access to a portal they can manage their own data in. If the local property manager is only interested in getting credit for high value sales and the small property owner doesn't have access to the portal, then likely the manager can screw them over so that people wind up at the more valuable properties. OTA's prefer data connections because that way the data is more up to date. It also means any errors are the fault of the chain (unless the hotel system itself has bugs).<p>By making Expedia aware of how their local managers are operating they might actually get this fixed. No OTA wants this kind of bad publicity. Just the US alone my employer (and its parent company) have nearly 300,000 hotels available. Keeping the data current is a massive pain at that scale since at the other end are individual people.<p>Also note that for most OTA's there are only a couple providers of hotel photos and one dominant one, and we all hate them as they suck terribly. Unless you are a speciality provider like Oyster or Hotel Tonight and can take the few photos you need, or are Tripadvisor and can get customers to take them, you are at the mercy of the photo provider.<p>So a quality bitching can get you better service (as a hotel provider) from an OTA. Even better is make a deal with someone who provides small hotels with data management (which does cost money) so that your room availability is all electronic.<p>The hotel business is all about filling rooms. The average hotel hopes for 70% rooms filled tonight. OTA's do provide a lot of hotel bookings so you can't do without them. But if the local OTA hotel property manager sucks there are 4 major players you can deal with (plus all the speciality ones). Yes you have to give them a commission (20%+ usually) but if you work with them correctly they can fill your rooms.",1356451477

The ""failure"" they had was because the satellite wasn't the primary mission, it was piggy-backing on the primary mission. It didn't make its orbit because after a recoverable mishap NASA didn't want to take any chances with the orbit of the ISS.<p>That's not a failure of the rocket. It's just the operator of the primary mission calling the shots, and the secondary mission suffering as a result of that.

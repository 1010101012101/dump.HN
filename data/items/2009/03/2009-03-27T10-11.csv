I consider myself reasonably well-versed with C, and I had never heard of that header.<p>I would of course, bias and all, consider any programmers deciding to use it to be well out of touch with reality.<p>I don't see a real-world benefit either, all it does is make those guys feel macho and elite for knowing something (of little value, in my opinion), <i>and</i> making the code hugely harder to maintain.<p>Ask a manager, while providing some kind of statistical data showing how common use of this header is in C code ""in the wild"".<p>A quick search with code.google.com gives _0_ hits for ""iso646.h"", that tells me something.",1238151104

That may be part of the issue, but honestly I think it's more likely to be down to the random bureaucracy of the JSR and JCP efforts.<p>I really don't buy the conspiracy theory and I'm puzzled to see the article up-voted so high without comment.<p>I'm much more interested in the question of what will actually arrive in Java/JDK7 and whether they'll ever move to a faster release cycle than the current geological process.",1238150998

534910,comment,530605,533651,0,0,danbmil99,,,"I believe I categorically disagree with every point you make.  You are pissing in the wind if you think you can treat a system with 100M LOC the same way you wrote assembly on a 6502.  They are different beasts, with totally different emergent properties.  It's like claiming that you can understand the weather if you just stick to thinking about individual molecules.<p>[edit:] I believe the xkcd strip can be read two ways.  Unknowable complexity equals magic (a riff on Arthur C Clarke).  I strongly believe that exactly what's been wrong about software is our clinging to the idea that it is reducible and manageable.  We don't think that way when we work in the physical world; we do rely on science, but it's empirical science, with statistically useful models at appropriate levels of abstraction.  We don't rely on quantum mechanics to build bridges.",1238150792

534897,comment,533782,534628,0,0,amvp,,,"I agree - digg has a fairly elegant design that's easy on the eye, without being obstructive. I don't think hacker news would suffer a great deal if a :little: more attention was paid to visual design. It doesn't really matter, I think people come here for the content, and that's fine.<p>Rater than comparing hn with digg, the comparison I saw somewhere was with <a href=""http://www.newspond.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newspond.com/</a> - an example of a site that looks nice (if you like gradients and glasy, round corners), at the expense of usability (only 3 posts per screen height etc).

The organization has a very bad name here for advocating drastic reforms that led to social shock and, yes, many deaths. It might be more a fault of our own government, but still it feels better to be debt-free.",1238148968
534892,comment,533849,534241,0,0,davidw,,,"IMO, this is a problem with many things - it's very easy to focus on that which is quantifiable, and ignore the fuzzier stuff.  For instance, I did a comparison of Linode and Slicehost which has proved quite popular, but one of the things I stated up front was that while it's possible to measure costs and things like memory and disk, it's not really possible to easily compare service, especially as for the most part, hosting is invisible, and service only becomes critical in an emergency.<p>Economics in general suffers from this problem too.  It's easy to quantify things related to money, but much more difficult to deal with the benefits from more abstract things.",1238148880

To really make Erlang turn over nicely, you have to isolate contact with external libraries, usually in other Erlang nodes (real, OS level processes).  Kind of strange, but very robust.",1238148611

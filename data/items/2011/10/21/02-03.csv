No doubt the emphasis on touch came from the iPhone, but beyond that, I don't really see the similarities.<p>This Judas mythology that has sprung up around the Google / Apple relationship doesn't fit the facts as I've see them thus far.  It doesn't make sense to put oneself into Steve Jobs' shoes when Steve Jobs was wrong / emotional (unless we want to understand why he was wrong).  And he was wrong, unless you believe a cackling Google CTO returned to his office one day and refocused the company on putting out the Android OS to fight with iOS.<p>Consumer beliefs have very little basis in reality.  If you asked me when I was 5 years old, I would have said Transformers copied Go-bots, eventhough Go-Bots had been released as a toyline and an animated series well before Transformers.

3138142,story,,,6,21,waru,"Ask HN: My Revenue Model- How does it sound?",,"Hi, I'm working on a video game start-up in Athens, Georgia. I was asked about our revenue model, so I did a formal write-up and was wondering how it sounds. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.<p>Here goes:<p>Our game will be released in two versions: a free, Lite Version (where users can play endlessly, but upgrades necessary to advance above a certain level are locked) and the Full Version, which will cost one dollar. It is hard to predict sales, but we expect about 50,000 copies in 2012. The App Store keeps 30% of each sale.<p>The other part of our revenue model is merchandise. One thing that sets our game apart from other restaurant simulations is the simple, expressive, and numerous characters (rather than the boring, generic characters of many other games in this genre). We are focusing on creating popular characters that will re-occur in multiple games and be featured on merchandise. These re-occurring characters will not only boost the familiarity and popularity of each game, but also add to people's desire for merchandise.<p>In Japan, where I lived, worked, and studied for four years, they have perfected this process; in the development of an animated TV series or video game, for example, there is a large focus on creating high-quality characters (simple, highly graphic, and visually appealing) that can cross over into other media, produce spin-offs, and be featured on merchandise. This ends up generating far more profits than the sales of the original product. I think that many American video game companies do not appreciate the importance and potential of high-quality, appealing characters.<p>In terms of platforms, our game is planned to be released for the iPhone/iPod Touch, but could easily be ported to the iPad, which is number one on our list. If successful, it could also be ported to the Android. In addition, we would like to make it playable on PCs and Macs, though without the touch-screen, gameplay might take a little reworking.<p>...So, how does that sound? Thanks in advance for any feedback.<p>(The game I am talking about is actually an active project on Kickstarter right now, with one day left to go. You can see it here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bts/cafe-murder)",1319165394

The latter two will slow it down a bit.<p>Another possibility is to figure out which sets of data are taking up the most space, and offload them to a separate disk-backed DB, and just cache the most frequently accessed subset of that data through Redis (this could be easily done through key expiration).  I find this option kind of painful, mostly because I really like the way that Redis approaches data, and using another database is comparatively inconvenient.<p>Having worked with it a bit, I think Redis is a completely awesome piece of technology, and in practice it is perfectly good to use for something like this, at least in the short term.

(Basically you could then run two instances of Redis, a RAM based one and a disk based one, echoing commands to both, but allowing data on the disk backed Redis to expire and taking responses from whichever returns an answer first).<p>My only hope is that clustering won't take to long and that it won't be abandoned in favor of a different castle in the sky if it doesn't turn out to be perfect.",1319164821

The C++ 3D engine I'm using uses enums, and my binding library represents enums in script with an object that overloads the == and != operator.  I really need to get around to optimize that.<p>- Garbage collection is not slowing me down (much).  I only spend 10% of my time in GC functions for the script (and I have a lot of scripts running).  Once I accidently left a call to ""Collector collect"" in my game loop, then GC took 40%. But, Io's garbage collector didn't make the game jerky, even with a collect in my game loop.<p>- There are some things that are better to write in C++ than in script.  I don't mean, better from a performance standpoint, I mean there are some things that are <i>quicker to implement</i> in C++ than in script.  I started with the idea, ""I'm going to write everything in Io and optimize later"" and I made a lot of bindings to C++ function, both high and low level, to support that goal.  But some things like dealing with triangle meshes or bit twiddling do better in C++.  Scripting is faster to implement ideas in for so many things, but in places where C++ shines it is still faster to do in C++.<p>- When you make memory errors <i>in C++</i> they generally cause a crash <i>in Io's</i> garbage collector.  I once lost a month debugging and instrumenting every line of Io's garbage collector to figure out why it was freeing objects still in use only to discover the actual problem was a C++ library was squirreling away pointers to objects it didn't own and reading through the pointers later when the objects were not guaranteed to still be live (even in a pure C++ program).<p>- The chain of events where a memory error in C++ blows up in the script garbage collector goes like this:  a C++ object gets deleted, but another C++ object still has a pointer to it.  When the script asks all the C++ objects to mark the objects they're using (Io uses a mark-sweep collector), the live C++ object holding a rogue pointer calls the mark() function on a deleted object.  But the call succeeds because the deleted object hasn't been completely overwritten.  But the the corpse of the deleted object in turn holds references to <i>script</i> objects which it <i>has not</i> been marking previously because <i>this C++ object didn't exist anymore when the sweep started</i>.  The script objects it used hold have just been collected, but it still knows their old addresses.  It asks the script interpreter's garbage collector, hey, go mark script objects for me at these addresses.  The script's garbage collector then tries to mark script objects that aren't live, follows the graph of dead script object's references to other script objects, also dead, and eventually reaches a bum pointer.  Blammo!  The GC just blew up deep in a forest of script objects, and the poor script language gets blamed for something C++ did.",1319164515

This, of course, varies a lot by location.<p>The big problem with this is that wages for the unskilled have not been keeping up with inflation, while wages for the skilled have, and the skilled and unskilled are in competition for some resources, for example, housing within commuting distance of the city.<p>>And the solution is genetic engineering, an infant technology.<p>This makes a lot of assumptions;   The first assumption you make is that the demand for unskilled or minimally skilled labor is significantly less than the supply.  At the moment, this is true;  but I don't think this is normal.  Throughout most of history, most people supported themselves by doing minimally skilled labor.<p>The next assumption is that the factors that attributes that allow a person to get and keep a skilled jobs are all genetic.<p>Obviously, there are huge holes here.  Personally, I believe that there is such a thing as generalized intelligence, though this is only weakly supported by the scientific evidence.  Further, while I feel that this generalized intelligence may be dependent largely on genetic factors, the scientific support for that theory is also pretty weak.<p>Even if I'm right on both counts, and generalized intelligence exists and it's largely genetic in nature, the correlation between wage and IQ is... weird.   Earnings tend to increase with measured IQ up to a point, then they flatten.   It could very well be that IQ correlates with something else that correlates to wages.<p>My point is just that the evidence for unskilled workers being genetically unskilled is, well, not very strong.",1319163192

At the end, the half that is told to exercise will have exercised more often than the half that did not.

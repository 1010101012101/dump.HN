And part of this is also that a lottery is a game of chance, not a game of skill.<p>Pitching for VC or angel investment is not a fixed game with a set of pre-determned rules, and also does involve skill. So I would say that it&#x27;s not really the same as buying lottery tickets. Also unlike a lottery where you have an even playing field there are people who do have advantages (friends with wealth, a good network, track record, etc.)<p>Now are the odds against you? Of course!

There&#x27;s still a small niche that uses it and one variant that&#x27;s mainstreaming. Python is a knockoff of it with a decent standard library that grew wildly successful. It&#x27;s why I recommend it as next best thing.<p>&quot;Do you have any examples? &quot;<p>Most articles written on history of LISP and its advantages come with examples of it going away in various companies or not getting adopted in general. Just try to recall how many of the following were done in (and still run on) LISP to see what I mean: processor support; operating systems; compilers; business apps; productivity tools; widely-used libraries; web services; popular FOSS apps or services; mobile apps or services; embedded systems. I&#x27;m sure your list in each is going to be tiny compared to the one&#x27;s that chose alternative platforms.<p>That&#x27;s the LISP effect. Both commercial products and FLOSS have continuously fleed from the LISP&#x27;s. Those that used mainstream alternatives got plenty of success. Just compare... pick a variant... a LISP&#x27;s success against C/C++, C#, Java, PHP, Python and so on. You can have a great idea but hardly anyone will contribute to it if it&#x27;s LISP. Clojure&#x27;s been the only exception, it&#x27;s tied to JVM, and still is barely a blip [1] on the overall radar.<p>So, that&#x27;s what I mean. You can use what increases odds of extension or adoption. Or you can use LISP with difficulty getting commercial or FOSS help. Now, the types of people that can churn out great LISP might be worth the extra effort and money. Jane St has a similar philosophy for Ocaml. Just worth knowing it&#x27;s going to be an uphill battle compared to the alternatives.<p>[1] <a href=""http://langpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://langpop.com/</a>",1436744949

No one would dare miss out hitting on the blonde, and no one is going to fault anyone for not hitting on the brunette &quot;she&#x27;s uninteresting&quot;. My only advice is to understand first what the investors&#x27; thesis is and play your pitch to those strengths. For example - what markets, what they look for in teams, and what their fund&#x27;s goal is. I&#x27;ve had a fair share of VC&#x27;s be brutally honest with me on the last point with an answer of &quot;we need just one billion dollar business in order to return our fund, so we take as many bets as we can to ensure we get one&quot;.",1436744948

I tell you you will deliver something or I will kill them. You start to negotiate for how much you will be paid for your labor...do you think you will get the best value for your labor, overall?

Not all voluntary transactions result in the best value for each party.  You are correct that they would get more for their labor if they could but the deviant nature of the transaction keeps it from being a value trade and creates, instead, a struggle to lose the least amount they can -- a destruction of value for that party but, if mitigated, the best possible destruction of value from their point of view.  It is not a healthy part of the system.<p>Think of a protection racket -- are those people getting the best value?

9875489,comment,9866483,9869218,0,0,rsc,,,"OK, let me try again. I read that post as asking about whether Rob&#x27;s talk helped make proposals from outside Google more successful, not about Google&#x27;s influence vs others.<p>I directly addressed Google&#x27;s influence in my opening keynote; the text is at blog.golang.org/open-source. But I&#x27;ll try to answer that interpretation of the question below too:<p>> Why is there a massive skew favoring Googlers having their proposals implemented compared to plebes?\n> Did the stats change after rob&#x27;s talk in 2012?<p>One reason is that Google pays for the bulk of the Go development, especially development that needs design (for example, the new garbage collector, or core language changes). This is changing slowly: we are seeing other companies begin to pay for Go development that makes Go better in some way for them. Canonical is paying people to add support for shared libraries, which matters for Linux distributions like Ubuntu. Intel is paying people to make Go take more advantage of Intel features; Oracle is paying someone to port Go to SPARC 64. I mentioned this in my keynote.<p>Another reason is that we weren&#x27;t clear about the vision for Go. Rob&#x27;s talk in 2012 was the first crisp statement of that vision. I hope to have elaborated a bit in my keynote. We&#x27;re still trying to articulate that clearly. I do believe that non-Google proposals have been more in keeping with Go since then, but I don&#x27;t have data. That talk was an important step by itself, but certainly not a sufficient one.<p>We believe a significant reason is that we have never properly explained what makes a complete proposal. If you look at golang.org/doc/contribute.html, it is very clear about how to send code but contains almost no text about how to send a proposal or design. We believe that being clearer about what makes a complete proposal and what makes a complete design doc will help non-Googler contributors be more successful at those. Of course, we will have to wait and see what the actual effect is.<p>This was the point of Andrew&#x27;s talk: to recap the history of how changes to Go have been proposed and made, and to admit that we realize we haven&#x27;t been doing a good job at supporting non-Google proposals and are trying to address that, both by being clearer about what a successful proposal look like and by establishing a timely process for answering them and an historical record.<p>The focus here is the _success_ rate of non-Google proposals. The balance of Google vs non-Google proposals, which you seem to be asking about, depends mainly on how much development is being funded by non-Google companies or individuals. Having a clear process may help increase that, but it would be a secondary effect.",1436744607

9875479,comment,9873457,9874238,0,0,jofer,,,"We won&#x27;t run out of natural gas resources any time soon.  This is to produce and liquify &quot;stranded&quot; natural gas resources.<p>Methane is _much_ more abundant than liquid hydrocarbons. There are many more ways to produce methane geologically/biologically than there are to produce liquid hydrocarbons.<p>To elaborate, there are three main end-member types of source rocks (organic-rich shales, etc that produce hydrocarbons when heated).  All of them will produce methane once temperatures are high enough.  However, only two of these are capable of producing oil at all, and that&#x27;s only in a relatively narrow window of temperatures.  Furthermore, type III source rocks (land-derived organics) are the most abundant of the three types, and they only produce gas.<p>Interestingly, if you look at current proven global reserves, you&#x27;ll find they don&#x27;t reflect the difference in abundance. (~1.7 trillion barrels liquids vs. ~1.2 trillion barrels oil-equivalent of gas) This is because exploration and development focuses on the more profitable liquid hydrocarbons.<p>There are several _huge_ gas fields (>100 TCF... That&#x27;s mind-blowingly large) that have been discovered but never appraised, developed, or produced.  There&#x27;s a lot of others that are likely to be of a similar size but have never been drilled at all.  The reason is purely due to the way oil and gas are traded.<p>From an economic perspective, natural gas (methane) is typically sold on long-term contracts.  There&#x27;s no global market for natural gas.  It&#x27;s not a commodity. Instead, all trading is region-specific.  You can only sell what you can deliver, and natural gas has to be delivered through pipelines.<p>Therefore, if the natural gas resources are not close to a heavily populated area, you can&#x27;t sell them.  These are referred to as &quot;stranded&quot;.<p>LNG (liquified natural gas), however, can be (and is starting to be) sold globally as a commodity similar to liquid hydrocarbons. Southeast Asia and Japan have a large demand for natural gas and relatively limited supply.  Furthermore, the gap between demand and supply is predicted to grow over the coming decades.<p>Australia has large &quot;stranded&quot; gas fields that Chevron and Shell have held rights to for many decades.  Australia also happens to be close to the markets with the greatest predicted demand for LNG.   Based on this, the super-majors (Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP, Total) have started to pour _huge_ amounts of money into LNG facilities.  Australia is currently home to the largest of these projects due to its location relative to markets with the largest demand.<p>At any rate, there&#x27;s the big picture in a nutshell.  I&#x27;m a exploration geologist in the oil industry, so I have a slightly different perspective than some, but hopefully that gives you some idea of the reasons behind projects like this.",1436744354

In world where everything is lazily evaluated by default and garbage collected, it is very difficult to reason about how the code will actually execute. Are you trashing the cache? Fragmenting your heap? Are you misusing the instruction cache? For performance reasons, Haskell programmers often need to forcibly make operations strict and turn off the thunk essentially. This is a layer of complexity you don&#x27;t often see in blogposts and Haskell tutorials. In contrast, I can look at C or C++ code and tell you more or less exactly how it will map to assembly (with some exceptions like when compilers decide to inline).<p>So in short, that Haskell you know is not the full story. I&#x27;ve written some Haskell programs and tried very, very hard to make them fast (they were parallelized too). At the end of the day, it&#x27;s hard for a language to completely outclass another one because there are tradeoffs and life isn&#x27;t so simple.",1436743635

There&#x27;s no way these guys can truly believe that e.g., forcing Apple to decrypt iPhones on demand is going to put a big dent in terrorism.  I guess they are a) hoping to get an upper hand on a few small-time/unsophisticated criminals and don&#x27;t mind stretching the truth to sell it to the public, or b) they view this as the first of many long-term steps in killing encryption/privacy in the US altogether, or c) they plan to deploy this much more widely than they are letting on, possibly even internationally through things like trade agreements (in which case it could actually be useful for counter-terrorism.)",1436742306
9875373,comment,9874460,9875274,0,0,Lazare,,,"This is offtopic and, I freely admit, overly cynical.  However...<p>People in general are selfish; the core Reddit demographic (males 18-29) is <i>certainly</i> no exception.<p>One of the paradoxes of Reddit is that the site can appear so monolithically left liberal, yet at the same time so militantly libertarian.  Few politicians seem to engender such strong positive feelings as Ron Paul and Elizabeth Warren, often at the same time and from the same people.<p>The answer is that if Reddit has a vibe it&#x27;s &quot;freedom for me&quot;, closely followed by &quot;fuck you, I&#x27;ve got mine&quot;.  Redditor&#x27;s don&#x27;t like being censored, and they don&#x27;t like content they like (mostly celebrity nudes) being censored.  They don&#x27;t like taxes that they might have to pay, and they don&#x27;t like social programs for the poor, but they love taxes on the rich or spending on the middle class (and, especially, spending on student loans).  They&#x27;re anti-cop when the perceived victim looks like them, but pro-cop when it doesn&#x27;t.  They&#x27;re very much pro-pot, and pro-civil-liberties if it involves their email being read, but otherwise they don&#x27;t much care.  The NSA reading their email is a true outrage and morally indefensible; the CIA torturing swarthy foreigners is a big yawn.<p>It&#x27;s fair to call Reddit anti-authoritarian, but it&#x27;s the anti-authoritarianism of someone in a dorm room bitching that the dorm monitor asked them to turn their stereo down.  What there isn&#x27;t, in my experience, is any deep reservoir of principle.  The median Redditor will write outraged screeds about free speech if you suggest that the site shouldn&#x27;t play host to links to celebrity nudes, or if you move to ban a subreddit they <i>personally</i> participate in.  They might even follow along on a popular bandwagon (eg, making snide remarks about &quot;Chairman Pao&quot;) even if they couldn&#x27;t articulate why, exactly, Pao was meant to be bad.<p>So yes, cops shooting a pot dealer gets Reddit&#x27;s attention (although I will note that as of right now, the top comment is critiquing the writing of the article, and the second-top-top comment is blaming the victim, and yes I do think that is in part because the victim is black, and thus harder for the average Redditor to empathise with).  Youtube bullying an app author, or employers snooping on employees are also obvious examples of the stuff Reddit care about (ie, &quot;bad stuff happening to people like me&quot;).  What I haven&#x27;t seen is significant numbers of people who care about eg,  free speech <i>qua</i> a universal human right.<p>(And thus ends my probably overly cynical digression.)",1436742285

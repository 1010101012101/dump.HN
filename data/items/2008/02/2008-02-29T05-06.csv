125923,comment,125829,125829,0,0,randomhack,,,"Calling 16 PS3s a supercomputer is a bit of a stretch. The article doesnt quote any numbers either. Cell with 8 SPEs can do about 200 Gflops SP matrix multiply. So I assume PS3 can do about 150 Gflops. 16*150=2400 gflops single precision .. not a supercomputer by todays standards i would say.",1204263808

125919,comment,125841,125879,0,0,tx,,,"Nobody hates Java, it's too generic and plain to generate such strong feelings. People don't care for language, but they do dislike <i>Java Programmers</i> because a big percentage of them, but not all of course,  got into CS only due to their neighbor once saying <i>""I hear programmers have no problem finding jobs""</i>.<p>The dumbest, least-motivated, non-reading bunch of individuals with engineering titles I've ever known were all Java or VB programmers. The kind who never heard of slashdot let alone reddit or joelonsoftare and use ""wizards"" to generate SQL queries. Heck, these dudes even call DELL or HP customer support (!) when their home computers stop booting.<p>Moreover, even smarter Java programmers have their issues. Nobody believes in design patters as much as Java people do. They never call new() on anything, they MUST have a factory that creates objects. They produce myriads of code that DOES NOTHING, but encapsulates some other junk that in return also does very little. These dudes can get quite aggressive if you try to point out to them that they never actually do anything but most of their time is spent <i>DESIGNING</i> (oh! they LOVE this word, in fact they don't like to be called programmers, they like to be called architects).<p>I absorbed Java like most of us in college, but I will never go to work in Java shop because the danger of being surrounded by these morons is a lot greater there than anywhere else.",1204263235

Bearing in mind the company is less than 3 years old, there will still be a lot of adjustment to do before we arrive at a configuration that I would call ""final"" (though I suspect it will continue evolving... after all, it's made of people!)...<p><i>> Would an adjustment down be possible (sorry sales, had to move 1% of your commission to ops to stave off a revolt!)?</i><p>We could, but I wouldn't... that would seem unfair. Sales do give up part of their commission but only when the sale is heavily dependent on ops, for example when it's a referred client (they were presumably referred because they got great service) or when it's an ""enhancement"" client where we go in and increase their claim size (there's a lot of technical work in that).<p><i>> Do you find the ""boil the frog"" method to help with this transparent structure? Giving someone 5x 2k raises over 15 months is far less of an event than giving someone a 10k raise after a yearly performance review. Was this something you guys thought of intentionally, or just the way you wanted to run the company regardless of the transparent structure?</i><p>I hadn't thought of it that way. From talking to our team, I think they're happier being able to earn smaller pay raises regularly, rather than having to wait a whole year to find out if they ""made it"". That was intentional - I don't like the way many companies wait a whole year to tell you whether you're doing well enough to deserve a pay raise, and right from the get go I decided it would be a six-monthly process, and then made it quarterly.",1364050721

If you take the free version, you're matched by an ML algorithm with a volunteer tutor and 95% of the time, you'll get quality.

People think in terms of comparisons rather than absolutes, doesn't this encourage comparison thinking?</i><p>The way this manifested itself is that after the first salesperson earned their first bonus (pretty substantial), there was certainly a bit of envy. The solution to that was to create a relevant bonus scheme for the operations/client management side that enables them to earn bonuses as well. For client management, instead of being based on new sales, the commissions are based on client retention and getting referrals. This way, client managers know they can earn good money too - they just need to do stuff that brings income to the company.<p><i>> Doesn't this create an odd culture setup where you can't promote superstars without getting clearance from everyone else (or at least create drama), even those who are in no place to judge, or even understand what the superstar does for the company?</i><p>Bearing in mind we're a relatively young company, this problem hasn't occurred and I don't see it occurring any time soon, for two simple reasons: 1) the ""superstars"" can see what the benefits of this open, transparent system are, and they want it to continue, so they don't want to break it for their own personal benefit, and 2) if they're superstars, then they're already earning a good bit of money in commissions.<p><i>> Does this work as a sort of mob-justice system for keeping employees from asking for more money... because now they have to do it in public and get labelled / deal with the politics of it?</i><p>I guess you can see it that way. The way I look at it is not that anyone is afraid to ask for more money - in fact, I would hope everyone wants more money. But they know what the answer will be. There's a known, proven way to increase their base salary quite substantially every 3 months if they put in the effort, and there are known, proven ways for them to earn commissions. So if someone wants more money, it's there for the taking. Why break the system by asking for an exception, when there's ways to achieve the same result relatively quickly within the system, that don't break the transparency culture?",1364049219

5428248,comment,5426875,5427948,4,0,anon1385,,,"I don't understand your argument here. It's not hard to look up how many patents MS or Apple have in the H.264 patent pool. It's then simple maths to see that neither of them hold a majority of the patents, so every H.264 licence they have to buy costs them money. Raising the price is against their interest while they continue to be big players in the market (and no, I don't believe MS have some long term plan to stop selling Windows and make money off video codec patents instead, the idea is ludicrous). I don't know how much say they have in the pricing, but I assume they have some influence.<p>The reason Apple and MS are ok with H.264 is that they are large and can easily absorb the cost, but it is harder for new players in the marketplace to do that, and harder for people at the cheaper end of the market where margins are much thinner. (There are other reasons too of course, like engineering time already invested in H.264, hardware support on millions of devices already shipped etc etc).<p>If you want to get anywhere with your argument then you are going to have to convince people at Apple and Microsoft and others. Calling them liars and dreaming up conspiracy theories about how they are going to make billions from MPEG-LA revenues won't help you convince them. Trying to publicly shame them with bad publicity isn't working and never had much chance of working because very few regular people care that Mozilla or Ubuntu might have to pay royalties for video codecs.<p>Final word of advice: move development out of the US. There are plenty of countries that don't recognise software patents. Remember the crypto situation? The answer there was to move crypto development outside the US. Make software patents into an argument about ""US Jobs"", and you will have a much easier time convincing legislators. At the moment they are being told that software patents protect US jobs, and that argument is always going to trump more ethereal ones about fair competition and freedom.",1364048992

(A rewrite of Masanobu Umeda's Gnus)<p>Gnus has a brilliant system for assigning a score to postings in all sorts of clever ways.  You have the simple stuff, like assigning a negative score to a given person, but you can also do more subtle stuff like scoring up postings that are responses to your own postings.  It also has various forms of adaptive scoring.<p>The score then influenced the ordering of threads, highlighting threads that need your attention and hiding threads and postings that you do not want to see.  (Most news readers had a bozo-filter that could do the latter, but which didn't really do any of the former well).<p>What made Gnus such a great newsreader was that, with the use of scoring, I could spend 10-15 minutes per day getting an overview of dozens of active discussions I was having across a bunch of newsgroups.  At one point the total number of postings in the groups I was following was around 6000 postings per day, and it took me mere minutes to get an overview of what had happened that was of interest to me.<p>The idea of scoring applied to RSS feeds would have been brilliant.  It would have made following a massive number of RSS feeds a far more attractive proposition.<p>I still think that there is an opportunity to revive RSS and make it relevant again, but I would recommend that people interested in RSS readers have a closer look at Gnus first.  RSS readers need to do a lot more than just aggregate and display feeds.  There are some great opportunities in figuring out how to add scoring in a way users can understand.  Also I think that harnessing social to provide additional signals that can be used for scoring would be neat.<p>Is there an RSS reader today that does any of this?",1364047982

All salary and bonus information is available (anyone in the company can log in to the accounting system and check it, along with all the other company financials).<p>It does mean that there's some people you won't be able to hire, if they demand a higher salary than their peers and won't budge on it - but then again, I'm of the view that I'm better off not hiring those anyway. I think the benefits of having an open, trusting, transparent culture far outweigh any benefits a single individual can bring to the company. Someone who's willing to damage the culture of the company for their individual benefit is probably not someone I want in this company.<p>What are those cultural benefits? Well, for example, because we are transparent all the way through, this is also reflected in the very open and relaxed culture, and it then is reflected onto our clients - after all, your employees will treat your clients in the same way you treat them. Most companies are ""open"" in quotes, but then when you get to sensitive information they closed up, which sets up an uneasy tension. We don't have any uneasy tensions at GrantTree. That's a huge benefit to me. I don't like dealing with uneasy tensions and lying to people and hiding stuff.<p>It's important to combine transparent salaries with transparent ways for people to increase those salaries, in my opinion. If you don't, people will feel stuck (transparently so). But if you do, people will feel that there is a known path for them to increase their pay and they'll work on that path rather than try to ingratiate themselves to get a pay raise in private.<p>Any further questions about this - feel free to ask.

6933678,comment,6927905,6927905,7,0,kken,,,"This is really impressive work. After skimming through the detailed paper it looks as if they are not picking up sound emitted from the CPU itself, but from the switching power supply circuit.<p>The frequency variation is caused by load differences. So they are in fact doing an indirect power analysis. A switching power supply will always change frequency as a reaction to variations in supply current, this is inherent to its design. I also believe that it will be very difficult to &quot;muffle&quot; all the inductors and capacitors as they are subjected to very high pulse loads. Magnetics will always find a way to emit sound...<p>It&#x27;s interesting to note that the biggest difference seems to be between register and memory instructions. This seems reasonable as memory instruction may, in the worst case, require powering the external bus, which is very power hungry. This will only get worse in future CPUs, as more and more clock gating is introduced.<p>So, I guess some countermeasures could be:<p>- If the CPU supports SMT or HT, load the other cores with a thread accessing random memory positions.<p>- Optimize the RSA code so that it&#x27;s memory access and runtime pattern does not depend on the key or clean text.<p>- Try to localize the RSA code as much as possible to reduce memory accesses. If memory access is required, do it all at once, for example by swapping entire cache pages.<p>Some of these are highly CPU dependent.",1387445703

You say that you want to design from the ground up to be more transformable than anything else, but without specifics this is just a goal, and it&#x27;s not clear that a new language is necessary or would buy you anything.<p>For example, take your idea about wanting to be able to replace all instantiations with a function call instead.  There&#x27;s no need to invent a new language for this; the AST of a program in most any language would have enough information to write this refactoring capability into a tool.  The hard part would be expressing the refactoring itself; how do you specify exactly the pattern you are trying to match, and exactly what you want to rewrite it to, in a way that is easy to use?<p>Maybe some other ideas you have <i>would</i> require a new language, but it&#x27;s hard to say unless you are more specific about what you want.  You might find that a lot of your ideas are implementable on top of existing systems.  Designing &quot;from the ground up&quot; has a certain appeal to it, but to justify the extreme amount of effort a new language would take, I think you&#x27;d want to be more specific about what the clean break would buy you.",1387445442

Also, staff can have a better idea if making such a purchase request is feasible to the company. So firms can be larger, and operate with less oversight... that&#x27;d be the goal.

There&#x27;d have to be some way of issuing them properly. Even if it just equated to the amount of cash reserves and/or cryptocoins the company had, because the idea is that anyone can cash out their intracoins if they need to. Staff need the confidence that they can do that at any time (provided management approves of it (perhaps only some staff have cashout approval privileges)) but the ability has to be there, even if management&#x27;s willingness is not. For example, an automotive company needs to buy new tires, and it&#x27;s the tire department that only has intracoins by having sold tires to production line, so that department cashes them out on the company exchange and buys tires from Dunlop. The production line needs some way of getting reimbursed by management or a Sales  department who recycles coins back into it (once cars have been sold), so it can then buy new tires and other factors of production to keep making cars. Perhaps Sales would make an order for xx cars from Production and pay with the intracoins it has converted from the cash/cryptocoins it has gained at the edge of the organization.<p>And this also leads to interesting use cases with company conglomerates -- sort of like frequent flyer points that can be used interchangeably across certain groups of airlines... but in this case intracoins across certain allianced firms.",1387444749

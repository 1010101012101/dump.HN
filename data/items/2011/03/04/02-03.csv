Apple has made it clear <i>from day 1</i> that you are only permitted on iOS at their pleasure and that they can change the rules at any time. For those of you who were slow, the way Apple banned Adobe Flash CS5 apps right before CS5 was going to be released should have been a wake up call. Maybe you bet that your corner of the world wouldn't be interesting to Apple or maybe you didn't realize you could get caught in the crossfire of an unrelated Apple objective. Tough. This is what you signed up for. If you don't like it maybe you shouldn't have been developing iOS apps in the first place.<p>The people I do have sympathy for are users. They are not going to understand why some of their favorite applications and services on iOS stop being updated / eventually disappear altogether. Among other things, Apple sold devices using the availability of apps. I didn't see any fine print saying ""your favorite apps might get rejected in the future"" in those ads. And I can't think of a similar platform that might have given users those expectations. So users have a genuine beef.

But the title of the original article states ""Thomas Jefferson and preparing for meetings"" which clearly does not convey that Jefferson was always like this.""</i><p>Actually, the HN title does not in fact say that Jefferson prepared for all meetings like this.  He clearly prepared for at least one meeting this way.  And I wouldn't be surprised if this was not the only occasion where he was so prepared.  But I'll grant you that perhaps using the plural of the word ""meeting"" instead of the singular was a tiny bit misleading.<p><i>""Furthermore in the article it is narrated one instance when Thomas Jefferson showed up prepared, which does not constitute enough evidence to support that Jefferson was this guy that wanted to be the most prepared in the room. Hence the HN title is very misleading.""</i><p>Actually, the <i>title</i> doesn't say anything like <i>""Jefferson was this guy that wanted to be the most prepared in the room""</i>.  The <i>article</i> may have implied that (with good reason, I think), but not the title.<p>So to call the title ""very misleading"" because we can't know what was going on in Jefferson's mind is a bit harsh, in my (admittedly biased) opinion.<p><i>""Why do people change the wording in the HN tittles (vs original ones) so that people would click on them?""</i><p>The fact is that the stories submitted to HN have to compete with other stories.  Many, many other stories.  Personally, I find every story I submit to HN interesting, and think they would be found interesting by other readers on HN as well, if they'd actually take the time to read them.  But if people don't click on them, they obviously won't read them, and not even know what they missed.<p>Usually, that means the titles have to be attractive, punchy, and interesting to grab readers' attentions, no matter how interesting the contents of the article may be.  That's just a fact.<p>Another fact is that otherwise interesting authors sometimes suck at giving their posts or articles good titles.<p>Here's a case in point:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2143752"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2143752</a><p>The original title was <i>""Understanding Syntactic Macros""</i>, while my submission had the title <i>""How Lisp macros differ from static code-generation and metaprogramming""</i> (a title I got verbatim from the body of the article, which I felt was a better and more interesting description of what the article was about).<p>My submission got a lot of upvotes; and, consequently, was probably read by a lot of people.  Do I think it would have gotten the same amount of attention if I'd used the original title?  Not for a second.  The original title might have been technically correct, but not very interesting at all.<p>So I do occasionally change the titles of my submissions to improve the odds of the article being read (while remaining faithful to the author's intent), or to make the title more clearly reflect what the article is about.  I think of what I do as a positive service to the HN community, and am not ashamed of it in the least, since when it works and the stars are right, people will actually read the article and be pleased by what they read.

When will people learn? A closed, proprietary system is a closed, proprietary system.<p>Marco is arguing that the Massah is being too rough on the sharecroppers, he's beating them inconsistently and in ways they couldn't reasonably predict. Let me see if I understand: These poor indentured servants built a business around what they perceived as a loophole in Apple's iOS terms. Their plan was to make millions of dollars off their ""free"" iOS apps while Apple got nothing. Then Apple shook them down for 30%.<p>Well I couldn't have predicted exactly <i>how</i> Apple would react, but I don't imagine anyone ought to be surprised that they did <i>something</i>. They're the landlord. That's what landlords do: They extract rents from the sharecroppers, and if rents aren't enough they kick the sharecroppers out and take over the land for themselves.<p>You can bitch and whine, you can figure out how to make money while Apple tolerates your presence, or you can stop building on proprietary platforms. Arguing that Apple is illogical or ought to be smarter or is shooting itself in the foot... A waste of electrons. Does Apple look like the kind of company that takes our advice on how to run a business? If it listened to people like us, it would be selling Windows PCs right now.<p>iOS and Kindles and Java and everything else controlled by a profit-seeking corporation are all the same things to developers. Of course Apple markets your work to end users and pretends you're happy with your cut of the two billion dollars in app store revenue. That's like a dating site marketing you to other users.<p>The bottom line is this: If you are developing for a proprietary system, you aren't in the business, <i>you are the business</i>. Trying to argue that Apple's proprietary system ought to be less closed or more free or have more pixie dust than Amazon's is wishful thinking. If you develop for <i>any</i> of these proprietary platforms, you are a sharecropper. You work at the landlord's pleasure to improve the land he owns.<p>Period.",1299205444

2286652,comment,2284547,2286587,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Apparently we'll just have to have a civilised discussion in light grey. ;-)<p>I would certainly agree that mobile devices with networking capabilities are a big step forward in general. What I think remains to be seen is whether tablet-style devices like the iPad and Galaxy Tab can carve out a sustainable niche fast enough to survive in a notoriously fickle market.<p>For leisure use, they seem to have fundamental weaknesses like very short battery lives and being difficult to read in sunlight. No doubt with time these will improve, but for now they reduce the applicability of tablet-style devices, and notably leave them vulnerable to competition from Kindle-style e-book readers in a major segment of the market.<p>For serious work, I think the lack of a real keyboard is a major disadvantage compared to netbook-style devices. It's going to be a long time before some sort of physical feedback screen is anything like as comfortable and efficient for sustained typing as even a cheap-and-nasty keyboard already is today.<p>Speaking of controls, while touch-based UIs could become the norm and stylus-type pointing devices might take over from mice for precision work, I don't think I'll hold my breath. Portable mice are widely used with laptops, simply because even the best built-in trackpads are relatively clumsy controls. Also, many a useful UI feature over the past couple of decades has been driven by awareness of what the user is passively observing, typically deduced by where a pointer is positioned. Again, this might change, but it's going to take a long time for conventions that have become as intuitive as handwriting to die, and I don't think the alternative UIs being developed for smartphones today are even close to refined enough for that job yet once you scale them up to tablet-size devices and applications.<p>I can certainly see tablet-style devices with custom UIs quickly becoming widely used in many niche areas where the flexibility has value, such as shop floor or industrial applications. And I'm sure there will always be an enthusiast segment of the market that values the flexibility they offer, though perhaps tempered in this case by the current closed/tightly-controlled software ecosystems that have been associated with these devices by the big players so far.<p>However, I think there is a long way to go before a general purpose device that is expensive enough to include components for everything but still only does one thing at once will beat out dedicated and cost-effective GPS satnavs, e-book readers, digital photo frames, wrist watches, and so on. I'm not saying it can't or won't happen, just that I don't think we're there yet, and until we are, companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and RIM are highly vulnerable not so much to competition from each other but to competition from specialist firms whose specialist devices do one thing, but better and at a lower price.",1299204599

At best, for ordinary folk all it does is jobs. That's a good thing, but there's more to life than just working.<p>A city, on the other hand, is somewhere to live. Poorer residents might work the exact same hours for the same pay, but living in the same place that they work means they're getting indirect benefits like physical and legal infrastructure. They're not just bussed into the SEZ to work in the morning and bussed out again in the evening, back to their 3rd world existence where they may have few economic or political rights. A SEZ on its own only produces goods, but a city produces people and lifestyle and cultural wealth, and thus fills an aspirational function. People go to big cities to pursue their dreams and make money, even though they know it may be expensive and difficult. A SEZ with nobody living inside it is just a place to work, and reduces the people who work there to commodity labor with no stake in the longer-term future of the place.",1299204501

I have known someone that put down Â£30k without understanding even the basics, and obviously they lost it all. I don't think you have to beat the pro's, you just have to beat the idiots, and be blessed with some luck.<p>I agree with other comments, you have to be ready to lose the money, hopefully in exchange for knowledge. If you can't afford to throw the money away, don't risk it. But you never know until you try..",1232456217

Or is the system of government we have (wherever we are) the most perfect we could ever hope for?<p>There's no reason to think mankind must always get worse. From time to time he'll get better. ""laissez-faire"", in this context, is non-sensical, ie, there is no government to allow anything. The concept is beyond that.<p>Personally, I think some form of representative republic with three branches of government with checks and balances is the right way to go. But even in the U.S., we have virtually a permanent legislative branch by gerrymandering, an executive that is split between only two political parties for over 140 years, and a court system that seems to misunderstand its own role. Is there a reboot button? A way to start over, with perhaps time-limits on laws, a constitutional balanced-budget amendment, (insert own ideas here)<p>New ideas, even ones which are scary dangerous, are not to be feared.

For prisons and mental health you're going to want all but the very worst individuals to be eventually re-integrated into the community.  For me that means they really need to be close to the communities they serve.
A spaceport is a potentially interesting idea with a proven track record.  That track record works both ways.  What advantage would a seasteading community have?<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/9742300@N06/2946734321/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/9742300@N06/2946734321/</a>
A patent-free zone may work well for the community but presumably if they want to sell the goods they produce to countries that respect patents they're going to have problems.
Data/document storage sounds a little unlikely.  I would expect the risks with a seastead to be higher than a building on dry land.  They can't compete on security and I doubt they could compete on price either.  We may have trouble making new land but in terms of acreage it is still significantly cheaper than seasteads are expected to cost.<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/9742300@N06/2947590204/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/9742300@N06/2947590204/</a>

Nothing too crazy here though I see no real advantage for seasteading.",1232454431

But the people here dismissing HAML out of hand because it's ""easier"" to just write the HTML by hand sound like people advocating typewriters over word processors.

Any unknown mutation could be the one he's looking for.<p>Perhaps this is actually what he did, and the ""no feasible way to automate the hunt"" refers to the cross-referencing step, not the differencing step.<p>Still though, reading that part almost made me email him saying, ""I'll find you a way to automate it!"".",1232453345

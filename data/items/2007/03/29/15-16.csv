After all, if I come up with a great social networking site but my employer is a financial software company, stealing my social networking IP will just be a distraction from their business activities.  They're <i>worse</i> off for taking ownership of the IP.<p><i>Do</i> tell your employer what you're doing and clear it with them.  Aside from being the honest thing to do, it also sets you up to get formal legal permission.  If they're not willing to do so, you know that immediately and can weigh your options from there, including quitting or giving up the startup.  <p>In some cases, your employer may even give you money, advice, and customers.  I once worked for a company whose CEO was the former CTO of Cybersmith (the gaming cafe company that went bust around 1999).  She came up with an idea that was useful for Cybersmith's business but was not something Cybersmith was willing to put resources into.  Cybersmith became her first (and only, it turned out) customer and gave them significant resources to fund development.<p>""3) The CEO will sign a document releasing our specific idea from the IP Agreement. Has anyone heard of this happening with success before??""<p>This happens more often than you think.  The most prominent example is Apple Computer - Steve Wozniak was on HP's payroll when it was founded, and needed HP to sign away their rights to the Apple I.  One of my cofounders is in the process of getting a similar release from Sony Entertainment, and I'll probably need something similar from my employer (I have verbal permission already).",1175183846

Basically it matters if you steal some kind of trade secret of a lot of existing clients/contacts.  <p>Not having enough time to properly do your startup should be your main concern.<p>",1175183684

Not sure what to expect but it should be fun!<p>With the insane cost of most of the hot web conferences, and the primary value that you get from conferences being people you meet, this is a great opportunity. Same crowd, no VC funding required to afford a seat. ",1175183230

I'm currently doing consultant work full time to pay the bills (and keep the girlfriend happy) while working on my startup nights and weekends.<p>My girlfriend simply HATES computers and this makes it hard for her to understand what I am doing, why I am doing it and what it could mean later on. To her, it's not work, since it's currently not bringing any money.<p>Luckily she does let me spend some time on my startup, even though I could be spending it her. Going to take advantage of it while I can.<p>",1175182982

7299,comment,7298,7298,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"This is something Ive been wondering about for several months now. I figured the group here might have some useful advice.<p>Like most other tech companies, the company I work for required I sign an Intellectual Property agreement stating that any ideas or work that I produce while an employee is property of the company. So this clause would include any work related to a startup. I know, this really sucks.<p>PG talks about this in several essays. Basically what it sounds like is that if there is ANY indication that you started work on a startup while under an IP agreement, VCs and acquirers will simply not touch you. Has any one else found this to be the case?<p>From what it looks like so far, my options are:<p>1) Jump ship and not look back. This puts big financial strain on us though as we don't have funding yet.<p>2) Leave as an employee, and rejoin as a part time contractor without signing an IP agreement. This would pay the bills and rent in the early stages but would probably be pretty draining physically. I also lose my unvested shares in the company but meh.<p>3) The CEO will sign a document releasing our specific idea from the IP Agreement. Has anyone heard of this happening with success before??<p>Or we could probably just start working in secret and building the product, but this is probably not a good idea because we wouldn't have early customer feedback. I definitely believe in ""release early, release often"". Or an easy solution would be to get accepted into YC but I know chances of that are pretty slim :(<p>Any advice is appreciated.",1175182423

There only needs to be some number of entities with deep pockets and marketing expertise.  Those entities could be small companies and individuals, or networks thereof. <p>While it might turn out that a large black-box structure like today's multinationals is the most efficient organization for accomplishing certain important tasks, it doesn't seem obvious to me that it must be so.<p>\nMichael Sullivan\n",1175182018

She's great for telling me when my ideas suck or when they might work.<p>Because of YCombinator's relocation requirement, I can't apply. I completely understand why they have that requirement and what's more - completely agree with it. Unfortunately, relocating is not an option for me as we have a 2 year old. Even though I live in Maine and Cambridge isn't that far away, it just wouldn't work.<p>My drive to found a startup is very strong - I'm not afraid of failure (god knows I'm good at it!) but I'm struggling with how to do start something up with a wife and a child. The whole micro-ISV, consulting thing is not something I want to do. <p>I know the conventional wisdom is ""don't do it"". But that's just not an acceptable answer for me. <p>Does anyone have any advice for me? I would absolutely appreciate it.",1175180980

It assumes that the success of a company is due to management carefully shaping the situation.  I&#x27;m going to guess that really successful companies are successful because employees are empowered to do what they love, and management largely sees its role as playing enabling and protecting functions rather than a shaping function.<p>Mid- and upper-management are liable to imagine that they have a big hand a company&#x27;s doing well, but my bet is that they have a much larger hand in a company&#x27;s doing poorly.

The highest employee doesn&#x27;t need a manager.

All of those responsible should be punished severely. I mean this in the strongest possible way. Nobody has the right to do this to another person and no victim should ever be to blame. It is <i>critically</i> important for any victim of rape and physical or sexual abuse to report it to the police.<p>Now on to the possible unpopular part, which I think I should motivate a little lest it seem I&#x27;m being callous.<p>Some select statistics [1]:<p>- According to the National Victim Center, 683,000 women are raped each year. (1992)<p>- Sexual assault is reported by 33-46% of women who are being physically assaulted by their husbands. (AMA 1995)<p>- 6 out of 10 rapes are reported by victims to have occurred in their own home or home of a friend, relative or neighbor. (US Dept. of Justice 1997)<p>- In a study of 6,000 students at 32 colleges in the US, 42% of rape victims told no-one and only 5% reported it to the police. (Warshaw 1994)<p>- Only 2% of rapists are convicted and imprisoned. (US Senate Judiciary Committee 1993)<p>- 77% of rapes are committed by someone known to the person raped. (Bureau of Justice Statistics 1997)<p>- <i>In a 1999 longitudinal study of 3,000 women, researchers found women who had been victimized before were seven times more likely to be raped again. (Acierno, Resnick, Kilpatrick, Saunders and Best, Jnl. of Anxiety Disorders 13, 6.)</i><p>Now the possibly unpopular part:<p>When I was growing up, there was a popular radio show on called Loveline (it might still be on) hosted by Dr. Drew Pinsky (an addiction medicine specialist) and Adam Carolla. As a teen it was fun to listen to people calling in with various oddball sex and relationship questions. But about once a show, some poor girl would call in with a sad story about all the abusive boyfriends they had had. <i>Every Single Time</i> Dr. Drew would ask the question &quot;who abused you when you were little?&quot; and <i>every single time</i> there was somebody in the girl&#x27;s family who had physically, emotionally or sexually abused her.<p>Dr. Drew would then patiently explain that she needed to get some very serious psychiatric treatment and that, something about that experience seems to fundamentally break a person&#x27;s ability to find and form functional healthy, intimate, relationships. They&#x27;ll continue to seek out abusive relationships and it&#x27;ll keep happening until they properly deal with it or they find themselves at a very sad end.<p>Something about that hit me and stuck with me, and over time I&#x27;ve noticed that my friends and family who seem to have the worst repeated relationship problems all have had abusive (on some level) childhoods -- men <i>and</i> women. It wasn&#x27;t just that it was surprising, or paradoxical, but that Dr. Drew answered it almost on autopilot. It was such a common pattern that, even when the caller tried to avoid answering it, or coyly tried to redirect, eventually it always came out at something like near 100% of the times I heard the story. It somehow slotted into an addictive behavior pattern that people who suffer from it are not really even aware of -- even if they can talk at length about it and sound quite lucid.<p>As I read this story, those episodes came back to me: the abusive childhood, the rapist husband, continued assaults, and I kept reading, hoping to see that &quot;notmyshame&quot; had sought out such help. But it never came.<p>Coming out about being raped is an incredibly brave thing, writing about it and sharing it is one of the most difficult things a person can do. But moving on and getting the right kind of professional help is <i>just as important</i>. I hope that the next post I read from &quot;notmyshame&quot; is that she went and found somebody professional to not only help her with the pain of the rapes and the abuse, but for the possible relationship issues that she may continue to have unless it&#x27;s properly dealt with.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/monsters/drake/Lecture%20Notes/rape_statistics.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/monsters/drake/Lecture%20Note...</a>",1384645230

If what I&#x27;ve seen is at all representative, Google are increasingly perceived to be a security/privacy risk (though this is hardly unique among cloud services) and perhaps worse for them, they&#x27;re not perceived to be a stable long-term bet (too many dropped products, too many unwanted changes happening too fast, nothing special in terms of quality or features, and little support for users).<p>Some of these factors presumably won&#x27;t be as damaging to Google in the consumer market, or at least not as quickly, so I don&#x27;t see their main advertising business dying any time soon. However, to businesses with real money on the line and organisation-wide IT strategies to plan, Google&#x27;s overall offering looks increasingly unattractive. For example, Google Docs/Drive/Apps have been tried by various groups I know. None is still happy with them, and several have been forced to move at least some of their activities to alternative systems because the Google ones just weren&#x27;t capable of getting those jobs done. Chrome is another example I&#x27;ve more often heard mentioned between curse words than flattering ones recently. And I already mentioned in another post the horrible experience we had trying to organise some Google Ads.<p>Google&#x27;s resilience appears to stem in part from traditional alternatives shooting themselves in the foot by also pushing to cloud-based offerings and therefore immediately running into similar concerns.

Hard to find many resources on this type of stuff... the &#x27;Age of Empires&#x27; Gamasutra one is awesome too.<p>We used Apple&#x27;s Game Center API for the online portion of Stratosphere: Multiplayer Defense (iPad), and it was pretty nice that Apple did all the work as far as network packets go... but you do have a choice between reliable and non-reliable sending. It wasn&#x27;t explicitly said, but we assumed one was TCP and the other UDP. We went with the reliable option for all of our packets and it didn&#x27;t really prove to be a problem, even simulating under 3G. Granted, Stratosphere is a strategy game. The bigger problem ended up being just having enough people online at one time to even play lol.",1384642905

The &quot;bell curve&quot; is an asymptotic distribution law, and even assuming that the distribution of performance is indeed normal, it is outright idiotic to fit the bell curve with as low as 10 people. The chance that no one out of 10 random people will be really at the lowest 5% of performance, is as high as 60%. The HR even uses an Excel sheet to even draw a normal distribution...<p>I have seen many good people&#x27;s careers stopped in my farm (and it is a big farm), because of this &quot;bell curve&quot;.",1384642905

Any ideas? I would be willing to spend between 2 and 3 hours a week to maintain it after building it. Thanks in advance :-)",1384642852

9771587,comment,9770020,9771144,0,0,outworlder,,,"Not exactly years of programming. But years of studying computer graphics, as applied to games.<p>I bet I could show this article to myself back when I started CompSci and be able to comprehend most of it. But I was a Gamedev.Net addict, tried my hand at competitions and tried to write my own 3d engine. At some point, my mathematical knowledge became the bottleneck.<p>There are a lot of established methods, you can pick a lot by reading SIGGRAPH, but that&#x27;s too heavy early on. If you are truly interested, you should start by learning how to put simple 3d geometry on screen. Then, when trying to figure out how to make things look better, you&#x27;ll naturally gravitate to learning what you need.<p>Nowadays, it is much easier to start, since we have WebGL and all you need is a browser and javascript. On the other hand, shaders are now a mandatory part of the rendering pipeline, so you need to learn those.<p>When trying to apply these techniques in real games, there&#x27;s indeed lots of experimentation. And many times game developers come up with novel techniques. See papers by Valve, for instance.",1435154358

A more senior officer has to review the continued detention from the 6 hour mark up to 24. A Superintendent or above can authorise up to 36 hours. Beyond that a Magistrate can authorise up to 96 hours in 36 hour blocks.\nDuring this time the individual has access to legal advice, where the reasons for continued detention have to be provided and the evidence thus far collected explained (again unless a very senior signs off on why not).<p>Unless you&#x27;re been arrested for a very serious crime, in which case you&#x27;re going to be defended for free by a very experienced QC who will tear apart dodgy process, you are likely to be arrested for a handful of hours. The exceptions would be being held overnight, if you&#x27;re drunk/high and thus incapable of being interviewed etc.<p>Things are slightly different in Scotland where you get detained not arrested, but the principles are broadly the same. UK policing as a whole has been through periods of dodgy processes and huge reforms in the wake of them. There are likely to be very few criminal justice systems in the world I&#x27;d rather interact with than the UK one, especially if I were accused of a serious crime.<p>Edit to add - plus the premise of &quot;fishing&quot; implies there is no existing evidence.

It is true up to a certain point that what you say is true, as I also said. But if you open the border wide to let anybody in for any reason the near utopia you are describing is just not possible. When someone crosses the border and finds a job to be the productive citizen you describe, all&#x27;s well. What about when multiples start crossing and there are no jobs for them to have? Let&#x27;s say your wonderful catering company has too many workers now and not enough new tech companies to sustain hiring yet more people streaming across your open border. Social services will start to fail as the demand increases but the tax revenue doesn&#x27;t increase with the demand to support it. There are many municipalities out there that are struggling to come up with the money to support the influx of immigrants that were placed, not moved on their own, by means outside their control. I&#x27;m not even talking about obvious things like welfare. I&#x27;m talking having to suddenly build schools and hire teachers that weren&#x27;t in the budget to support all these new kids that are suddenly showing up.<p>Question, would slicing coconuts on the side of the road in Haiti provide the equivalent in pay as taking a low paying catering job in the US considering and comparing elements such as cost-of-living and whatnot? There are many people living in ways we would consider abject poverty but seem to be much happier with their situation than many of the supposed better off immigrants. It&#x27;s sometimes about perspective too.<p>I would also say the current economic status of many countries around the world suggest that &quot;everyone way fucking richer in one fell swoop&quot; is not happening regardless of their immigration policies.

It just doesn&#x27;t work for them.  The possibility that a critical part of their infrastructure is dependent on the fortunes of a group of maybe 50 people being successful.<p>And it&#x27;s not enough to say &quot;well they have the source code&quot; and can support it themselves.  That doesn&#x27;t work for them when the auditors come out and need to identify WHO is responsible for taking care of support and the lifecycle of the code.

Transactional databases are in far more places than you&#x27;d expect.  If your app has scaling issues with accessing a non-virtualized database or datastore, then that&#x27;s going to be a problem for you.  If your OS can&#x27;t handle redundant datapaths or confuses the Ops people about which piece of physical hardware is causing the issues you&#x27;re seeing at the virtual layer, then you&#x27;re going to have even more problems.<p>So I&#x27;m not drinking the Kool-Aid just yet.

My original point was that I have a hard time coming up with an &quot;interactive analytics&quot; usecase where you&#x27;d want to process TB/s on one node that can keep only a few gigs around -- the improvement of doing this on GPUs instead of the old fashioned way on general purpose hardware seems to be that a query over the same dataset returns a few milliseconds faster. I reckon a user running interactive sql queries doesn&#x27;t really care if their queries return in 10, 50 or 100ms -- I am not even sure I would be able to notice that difference myself.  However, if you actually had a usecase for this you could still use the approach I described and make it as fast as you desire by scaling it out [tweaking the shard size] on conventional/commodity machines.<p><i>>  you can just throw more boxes at it.

IMHO the hard part of doing that is making sure we understand the customer&#x27;s domain, gather/track the right data from their systems and then work with them to slice and dice and visualize this data to discover &quot;signal&quot; from the &quot;noise&quot; which we can then feed back and use to optimize their website/app. The technical part of being able to handle the relatively large volumes of (non-preaggregated) source data is really just the means to that end.

9771288,comment,9770059,9770059,0,0,shoo,,,"I think it is unhelpful to look at something like population in isolation from other deeply related issues, such as affluence, pollution per affluence, technology, unsustainable consumption of resources / production of pollution, changes in efficiency. For example, one simple way of modelling things is the `I=PAT` equation (see also the critique under &quot;Reception&quot;) [0].<p>I&#x27;ll quote from VHEMT [1]:<p><pre><code>  > For example, in terms of energy consumption,\n  > when a North American couple stops at two it’s\n  > about the same as an average East Indian couple\n  > stopping at 30, or a Bangaledesh couple stopping\n  > at 97.\n</code></pre>\nMaybe energy consumption is a bit abstract - it is not immediately obvious what, if anything, is wrong with that. Instead we could consider per-capita CO2 pollution, taking the 2005 statistics from Wikipedia [2]:<p><pre><code>  United States: 19.3 tonnes CO2 / (person year)\n  Bangladesh: 0.3 tonnes CO2 / (person year)\n</code></pre>\nFrom these numbers, a 1 additional US person has the same immediate short-term impact in terms of CO2 pollution as about 64 additional Bangladeshi people [2].<p>CO2 pollution produced by humans is primarily the cause of recent global warming. If the current trend in greenhouse gas pollution continues to track the high end of (conservative) IPCC baseline models [3] then it will not be surprising if we end up with a world that is +3.5C -- +4C -- or more higher than baseline, by the year 2100 (from memory, we&#x27;re already at about +0.6C this year). It really doesn&#x27;t look like we will limit the temperate increase to the &quot;agreed &#x27;safe&#x27;&quot; +2C in the real world, outside of modelling scenarios[4].<p>It doesn&#x27;t appear that the world has experienced a temperature of +4C for quite a long time (either hundreds of thousands or millions of years, depending on which graphs you look at)[5][6]. The last time it was that warm certainly pre-dates human agriculture (~12000 years ago) [7], and perhaps the human species (100s of thousands of years ago)[8]. I.e., we are rapidly pushing the climate toward a state where humans and human civilisation have never previously existed. The result will likely be unpleasant, in the sense that many people will suffer and die, due to heat stress, natural disasters, reduced crop yields, disease, and conflict caused by displaced people / resource shortages [9][10].<p>I have focused here on climate change in isolation, but that is just the first hurdle. Other serious concerns are human impacts upon biodiversity and the nitrogen cycle - and those are just the impacts that we&#x27;re able to measure [11]. There&#x27;s reasonable evidence that the world is currently experiencing a period of mass extinction [12].<p>So -- bringing it back to population. From the perspective of everyone else alive right now, assuming they are well informed and rational, should they think it is a good idea for me to have a child, particularly if I live in an affluent, polluting society[13]? I doubt it very much.<p>Of course, it isn&#x27;t all grim. There is still time for us all to get better at being altruistic, thinking clearly, predicting the future, cooperating, changing our minds about what might be important, and modifying our environment (for better or worse). But, at best, it is obviously a race between positive and negative trends. There is not much time left. But, from historical evidence, so far the metrics of biodiversity and CO2 pollution are very much going in an undesirable direction, with no sign yet of change.<p>edit: I&#x27;ll finish by quoting David MacKay out of context. He is talking about the UK&#x27;s sustainable energy debate [14]:<p><pre><code>  > We need to choose a plan that adds up. It is possible\n  > to make a plan that adds up, but it’s not going to be\n  > easy.\n  >\n  > We need to stop saying no and start saying yes. We need\n  > to stop the Punch and Judy show and get building.\n</code></pre>\nI pretty much agree with this sentiment in the realm of sustainable energy, and I&#x27;d also agree with the sentiment if it were extended much more broadly, beyond MacKay&#x27;s intended context, to questions of population, affluence, equality, poverty, intergenerational fairness, and how economies should be run.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_%3D_PAT#Reception"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_%3D_PAT#Reception</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.vhemt.org/demography.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vhemt.org/demography.htm</a>\n[2] we&#x27;re glossing over the fact that some of these additional people might choose to have children, or that annual per-capita CO2 pollution could change.\n[3] For 2014 data, see figure 3 (a) of <a href=""https://www.lakeheadu.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/53/outlines/2014-15/GEOG4411/Friedlingstein%20et%20al.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lakeheadu.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/53/outl...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.rtcc.org/2015/06/19/is-avoiding-2c-of-global-warming-possible/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rtcc.org/2015/06/19/is-avoiding-2c-of-global-warm...</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page3.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page...</a>\n[6] <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/All_palaeotemps.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/All_pala...</a>\n[7] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_agriculture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_agriculture</a>\n[8] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Human"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Human</a>\n[9] <a href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/11/18/Climate-change-report-warns-dramatically-warmer-world-this-century"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/11/18/Climate-...</a>\n[10] <a href=""http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/4degrees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/4degrees/</a>\n[11] See figure 6 of: <a href=""http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&context=iss_pub&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com.au%2Fscholar%3Fq%3Decosystem%2Bsafe%2Bboundaries%26btnG%3D%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%252C5#search=%22ecosystem%20safe%20boundaries%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?articl...</a>\n[12] <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jenny_Mcguire/publication/50267709_Has_the_Earth%27s_sixth_mass_extinction_already_arrived/links/00b7d5183edf5b6c76000000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jenny_Mcguire/publicatio...</a>\n[13] assuming they don&#x27;t have some kind of interest in driving down the cost of labour in the short term, to reduce the labour cost of producing this season&#x27;s model of useless widget.\n[14] <a href=""http://www.withouthotair.com/c32/page_250.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.withouthotair.com/c32/page_250.shtml</a>",1435151584

Which leads naturally to mapping the abstract, mathematical notion of binary digits, {0, 1} to those pairs of physical states.  Notice that I don&#x27;t say tensions, because sometimes it&#x27;s current, and sometimes it&#x27;s charge (eg. in condonser-based memories, like DRAMs).<p>But notice that when transmitting data eg. with modems, or even with more modern options such as ASDL or optic fibers, engineers actually use more states, more than two different symbols, to attain higher bit transmission rates. cf. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud</a><p>Therefore you should realize that at the electronic level, engineers do not always use two states, so the notion of bit is not too relevant to computing: it&#x27;s only something that matters at some low-level layers.  Computers usually work at layers where it&#x27;s irrelevant.<p>Edit: Actually, there&#x27;s this <a href=""http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/index.html</a>  which may be interesting to you.  It is an emulator of the 6502 processor that shows the activation of the electrical circuits on the chip, in parallel to an abstract representation of the processor.  But actually, there is at least one intermediate layer that is not represented, and that makes it hard to understand the relation ship between the two layers represented: we&#x27;re lacking a logic diagram.  If you are an experimented CMOS chip designer, you might be able to read the masks directly, but since the layout is optimized for the silicium it&#x27;s still hard to understand.",1435150860

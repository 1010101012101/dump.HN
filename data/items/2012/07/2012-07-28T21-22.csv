The fact that Google is able to charge for email is partially due to the fact that they offered it for free for so long and got so many people to like the experience that it created a lot of demand in the workplace for it - I think you really need a way to let people experience your application for free if you want any shot at enticing people to pay $20/month for it.<p>There may be some subset of people willing to pay $20/month for ultra-configurable filtering, but I'm not really sure how big that market is, and I doubt it will help you break into larger organizations.",1343512729

It is a digital material sold to people who like to consume content via their pretty and pricy devices. I agree that Apple makes it fun to consume content their way. And I'm sure that for the most part, people can still mostly absorb all the same knowledge that they would from a traditional paper book. But, this content has to be approved and modified to be consumed and therefor, it is not a book.<p>So the reason I am not comfortable with all this is for the reason I stated above. I was essentially tricked into believing they were selling books. Now that probably sounds extreme. But, the truth is that I am an educated ""tech person"" who looks at this stuff every day, and I did not think about this problem until now. The people they are trying to sell to are those in education, who are going to be raising and educating young people by reading these iBooks. When I was a kid, we were taught that books were magical and that the more we read, the more open our minds would become. In elementary school, we made us sing songs about books to make reading seem more fun and appealing.<p>If schools are adopting this form of content, then they are telling young people that the best way to learn things is via a model that is filtered (simply to increase Apple's profits).",1343512468
4306629,comment,4305782,4306562,3,0,sid6376,,,">> But is it also true that people who are depressed may also (always, sometimes) be resistant to the suggestion from others that they may be suffering from depression?<p>I had a girlfriend once, who suffered from bipolar disorder.
The problem is the feelings that you have while having  a depressive episode are real problems to you, in the sense that they affect you very deeply at that point. When someone suggests to that person that maybe you are just depressed, it often seems to them that you are trying to ignoring the issue and instead trying to shift the blame on them. This infuriates them further and they either lash out against you or shut up. After screwing up a couple of times,every time I realized she was possibly having an episode I tried to put it very gently to her and only after talking about whatever is bothering her.  
I will also suggest going through this link to understand how people having a depressive episode feel(Even though the article is about lupus). <a href=""http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory-written-by-christine-miserandino/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christ...</a>",1343512443

If you're stressed and/or avoiding sunlight, you're more likely to be depressed and fall ill.<p>2. You feel less pleasure while severely sick. Personally, I notice my affect when thinking about everything is dramatically different. I discount it for that reason.<p>3. Depression apparently involves some feedback loops that can make it a fairly stable equilibrium; so the shift in experience during the sickness might linger (perhaps the isolation and lack of sun while sick lingers).<p>I don't see any studies showing a strong link.

It isn't like Apple is rejecting political books with which they disagree or preventing users from reading specific content on their devices. Their store just chose not to sell an item. Supermarkets aren't obligated to stock every possible variety of orange juice, nor should Apple be held to any higher of a standard.<p>Apple doesn't have an obligation to sell anything and everything. It's their store. They choosing to not sell something isn't ""bad"" -- users of Apple devices can still read whatever they want.<p>Acting indignant like Apple has some mandate to sell anything that anyone wants is ridiculous.

4306515,comment,4305525,4306097,25,0,bcantrill,,,"Yes, pgrep and pkill originally come from Solaris. If anyone cares about the history here, they were added by Mike Shapiro in Solaris 7 to speed boot time -- he discovered that there were a ton of RC scripts that were doing ""ps -el | grep foo | grep -v grep"", and he was able to shave significant boot time by distilling this into one command.  (pgrep and pkill both originated with this work; in as much as they had direct inspiration elsewhere, it was from the ""slay"" command found in QNX.)<p>If my long-windedness can be excused, a pgrep anecdote that I feel must be told:  when Mike was originally doing pgrep and pkill, he wanted one to be able to search on every field specified in proc(4), including the wchan (denoted by pr_wchan), an archaic field that was actually a stowaway from Multics (!).  Even by Solaris 7, the wchan had no real significance in Unix, and the co-inventor of /proc, Roger Faulkner, flew into an indignant rage that Mike would include it -- and ""pgrep -w"" quickly disappeared from both Mike's workspace and his PSARC case.  Now, Mike and I were also the gatekeepers on Solaris 7, and we both wore pagers (aside: I'm old) that would page us whenever anyone integrated anything into Solaris with the bug synopsis.  Sometime after pgrep/pkill integrated into Solaris 7, I decided to screw with Mike a little:  he was headed to watch a Boston Celtics playoff game, and I knew he would be away from a machine for a few hours, so I started paging him with fake integrations that I knew would enrage him.  The first integration that I fooled him with was someone that he disliked rewriting a command that Mike himself had just taken from the same engineer and himself rewritten -- and I really tweaked him by making the synopsis be that the ""error messages could be improved"" (trust me that this was a sore point).  Now, I wanted the fake integrations to get more and more absurd over the course of the playoff game, so I next paged him with an integration from Roger:  ""pgrep(1) needs to be able to search on wchan"".  I was just getting ready to send my next page (after all, I had a couple hours of mischief planned) when Mike suddenly appeared in my office, drenched with sweat, panting ""please just tell me the first one was a joke too!""  As it turns out, he had taken my first page a little too seriously, had immediately stopped watching the playoff game, got back in his car and was returning to work to ""throw [disliked engineer]'s monitor out his office window.""  When he saw the wchan option to pgrep, he knew that I must be screwing with him, and fortunately stopped at my office before doing anyone (or anything) physical harm.  And that's how ""pgrep -w"" saved a monitor -- if not a life.",1343509671

I'm immediately reminded of the days when everyone who liked D proclaimed it would overtake C++ and rule the world with terrible, contrived examples: ""let me show you why my language is better than yours by completely misunderstanding how to solve a problem, then implementing that broken/overengineered solution in your language, then compare it to something my language's API can do for me, just so we can see how much simpler that bad solution is in my language!""<p>The insight to async I/O is that this server, for this I/O bound task, will perform as well as your GOMAXPROCS example:<p><pre><code>    require('http').createServer(function(req, res) {\n        res.writeHead(200);\n        res.end(""hello world\n"");\n    }).listen(8000);\n</code></pre>\nBut it's a lot simpler.  You don't need to bolt on parallelism when you don't actually need parallelism.  There are valid reasons to use Go, and there are valid complaints against Node.  I don't see any of either here.",1347656343

The MPS design has always been to spread the cost evenly, not push it into a cataclysmic event in the future.<p>That said, we have an abstract framework that could be made to work in other ways, depending on requirements.

Did you catch that Jimmy Kimmel bit where he sent someone out on the street with a ""new iPhone 5""; spoiler, it was an iPhone 4S. People on the street loved it.<p>I don't think that your average consumer needs a ""big update"". When a consumer buys a new Apple device, they're buying a couple of things that we (techies) don't connect with. They're buying:<p>* A device that they feel confident they'll be happy with (high user satisfaction rates support this)<p>* Peace of mind that they've got the latest, greatest device from a company they appreciate (Apple grand rating and a simple line up support this)<p>Neither of these factors show up in a feature comparison.<p>Customer satisfaction ratings for the iPhone are great. Why? I don't know. It's probably really, really hard to quantify, but I'm not sure it matters. What matters is that consumers are satisfied, and that they stay satisfied. Figuring out how to achieve that is Apple's job. I'm just calling it as I see it.<p>I believe the latter factor is more important than many people recognize. When you go to buy an Android phone, you're given a choice of many different models with some absolutely insane naming conventions.

I started thinking about the economics of a new mattress and couldn't get it to work out, financially. The biggest thing the big stores (like Mattress Firm, etc.) have is distribution and floor space.<p>You need to try out a new mattress. There's nothing around that. After trying over 50+ mattresses, I realized that. There are so many different kinds and not a lot in common. You'd be tough pressed to find 10 people like like the same mattress. It'd be like buying a car without test driving it. That never happens.<p>Then there's the economics of it:\n- Retail Price: ~$1,000\n- Price of Materials: I'd estimate to be around $100. Labor, probably close to $25.\n- Modern Mattresses Companies put a TON into research/development/marketing. I'd estimate that to be about another $100 (on the low end) of the cost of the mattress.\n- Shipping, even freight, for something this size has got to cost at least $25.\nRight now, we're at $300 for a $1,000 item.\n- This is the (fairly) hard cost of making the item. I wouldn't be surprised if the Sealy's of the world sell it to the Mattress Firms for $500 and make a $200 profit (reasonable, to me).<p>Then, to pay for even more marketing, floor space, employees and delivery service - you better believe that Mattress Firm demands a 50% margin.<p>If we could somehow fix the distribution/store front option, we could get the price down - but that's the tough part.<p>In case you were wondering, after all of my research, this is what I ended up buying: <a href=""http://chip-hanna.com/how-to-find-the-perfect-mattress-for-you-and-sleep-like-the-dead/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chip-hanna.com/how-to-find-the-perfect-mattress-for-y...</a><p>It was, honestly, the best money I've ever spent. A great bed makes all the difference.<p>I'm not very sure of the legality of this, but one possible option is to have ""If you like the Sealy Optimum Radiance, you'll like (insert new brand here)."" That would drive people to the Mattress Firms of the world to try them out, but online to purchase (what happens with most products today anyway).",1347653849

4523706,comment,4522974,4522974,5,0,ScottBurson,,,"I propose a different solution.  If I may briefly quote Wikipedia (from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousn...</a>):<p><i>The factors a court will look at when determining obviousness in the United States were outlined by the Supreme Court in Graham et al. v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City et al., 383 U.S. 1 (1966) and are commonly referred to as the ""Graham factors"". The court held that obviousness should be determined by looking at<p><pre><code>    1. the scope and content of the prior art;\n    2. the level of ordinary skill in the art;\n    3. the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art; and\n    4. objective evidence of nonobviousness.\n</code></pre>\nIn addition, the court outlined examples of factors that show ""objective evidence of nonobviousness"". They are:<p><pre><code>    1. commercial success;\n    2. long-felt but unsolved needs; and\n    3. failure of others\n</code></pre>\n</i><p>I think software patents pose several problems for the Graham factors:<p>(1) Prior art is too hard to locate.  The generativity of software is so great; it is so easy to invent new things; and so many things were invented before anyone even started patenting many of them, that it is very difficult to be confident that one has found all the prior art relevant to a particular patent application.<p>(2) The field is vast and continues to grow, with many subfields.  No one person can know everything that has been done in software.  This renders the very notion of ""ordinary skill in the art"" problematic.<p>(3) Because of those two factors, assessing the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention -- which was always a subjective process anyway -- becomes intractable.  Anyone can line up experts to say that the invention is or is not obvious.<p>Thus, the only one of the Graham factors that is workable for software patents is #4: objective evidence of non-obviousness.  I suggest that to obtain or prosecute a software patent, one should have to show objective evidence in at least one of the three categories in the second list quoted above.  Such evidence could take many forms.  The best, perhaps, would be multiple published academic papers showing an attempt to solve the same problem and presenting clearly inferior solutions.  Another kind of evidence might be reviews of products complaining of the problem that the invention purports to solve.<p>Commercial success is in some ways the best metric and in other ways the worst.  The biggest problem with it is that one has to file the patent application before releasing the product; at this point, evidence of commercial success is obviously unavailable.  Another problem is that there are, of course, other factors that play into it (""execution"" as they say) and that are often even more important than one's technology.  Still, if one manages to build a business around an invention where others have tried and failed to do so, I think that has to count for something.<p>I believe that requiring objective evidence of non-obviousness would solve, or go a long way toward solving, the software patent quagmire because in my opinion, the majority of software patents these days result from the application of relatively well-known techniques to novel <i>problems</i>.  That is, it's usually the problem that's new, not the solution; once one has noticed the existence of the problem, the solution is not hard to come by.  Obviously, for a novel problem, there is not going to have been time for anyone else to attempt to solve it and fail, leaving behind some public record of their attempt.<p>Although IANAL, it also seems to me that the change I'm proposing is incremental enough -- close enough to the rules that the Supreme Court has already enunciated -- that it could actually be accomplished.<p>EDITED to fix formatting, and also to add: I wanted fo get the above posted because I've been thinking about it for a while, but I don't mean to dismiss Lemley's point at all.  We clearly need to clamp down on functional claiming as well.",1347653421

I don't agree that a software fix (put software on phones to acknowledge data received, and thus improve the one digit % error margin) would solve this problem. It would be more beneficial to have real competition among carriers in the US to drive prices down. It strikes me every time to see how ATT charges 20x the price for 1/20th of the performance in data throughput  & quality compared to many European carriers. To compare: in some European countries you would get 4GB wireless data with - speeds of 14.4 MBps on a pre-pay card (no monthly commitment) for a price of $6. Competition doesn't seem to really work here. Which is a more important problem, thatn the 1-digit % measurement error margin.",1347652858

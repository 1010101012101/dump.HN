How do you define what is worth quitting your job, and what might merely annoy a user? Can you even quantify it? Is it illegal, and where? What is 'it', anyway?<p>I'm talking about things like identifying if somebody is gay or republican or kinky and using the information for profit. Aside from selling it to background-check websites and the like, and the fact that it's information people willingly give up about themselves to entities unknown, I have trouble understanding how you can be so offended you think people should lose their jobs rather than develop potential parts of a potential system that could maybe harm someone at some point.<p>Your assumption about the ""cleverness"" of developers is misguided. If a guy is told to write a small piece of code which simply takes HTTP requests from JavaScript and plugs it into a database, there is no idea what the fuck that could be used for. The guy maintaining the database also may not know what the fuck he's looking at, it may just be numbers. Are you really so willfully ignorant as to believe every single outcome of every single human action is cut & dry?",1355302636

4909184,comment,4904722,4908268,2,0,Gormo,,,"> However, corporations, bankruptcy, patents, etc. are all not state-of-nature constructs being reinforced formally. They are state innovations to encourage positive growth - do you deny this?<p>To some extent.  I'd certainly regard bankruptcy and patents as creatures of positive law, but these legal tools aren't property rights: patents are grants of monopoly over mere concepts - to the extent of allowing the confiscation of the physical property of third parties simply because they used it to implement an idea similar to yours - and bankruptcy is effectively a license for people to renege on their promises and nullify the property rights of their creditors.  Whether or not these are beneficial or useful policies is a separate question, but its clear that they contradict rather than protect property.<p>Corporations, on the other hand, most certainly <i>are</i> natural constructs - people engaging in organized collaboration is a viable definition of society itself - and they certainly would exist with or without recognition in positive law, given any context in which property rights were indeed protected in a consistent and stable manner.<p>> To your closing point, it sounds like you're saying that ""business models don't have to be approved by the government based on this metric"", however this would deny that the myriad taxes, laws, etc. make money itself the imprecise metric by which we judge this social value.<p>Well, my entire comment was an elaboration of a single point: that property rights aren't contingent on the state's approval, but rather that the state's existence - <i>as</i> a state and not a mere cipher for the strongest inhabitants of what remains a raw state of nature - is contingent upon its protection of property rights.<p>But we don't get to judge the 'social value' of people's activities as individuals, reducing things to simple rationalizations evaluated against subjective criteria. Money isn't an ""imprecise metric by which we judge this social value"", it's just an inert token used as a convenience to facilitate exchange, and the those taxes, laws, etc. aren't there to approve or disapprove of anyone's business model, but are rather (ostensibly) there to ensure that <i>no one's</i> rights are being violated within the undertaking of that business.<p>Society itself - people in aggregate - judges the value of an endeavor by supplying that endeavor with the very rewards that you'd make subject to the approval of only an excessively formalized subset of that society.  If the state intervenes to defend people against deceit or violence as they engage in commerce, then it's fulfilling its mission; if it intervenes to make that commerce itself contingent upon the whims of third parties, then it's subverting its mission.<p>> In an impossible situation, money would account for all positive and negative externalities<p>But your statement wasn't that there ought to be some means for assigning responsibility for negative externalities to those who created them; your statement implied that you believe that people ought to be obligated to produce positive macro-level externalites, else forfeit protection of their rights. Without intending any personal insult, I'd regard the latter as an unconscionable position.<p>> unlike today where it could just mean that you played the system, etc.<p>The same holds true of acquiring political power, and regardless of the institutional models and logical constructs we employ, society remains composed of the same set of people; so if you acknowledge the existence of malintent out in the world, how can you advocate admitting subjective discretion in the protection of rights?",1355300351

For example, some 386s did not honor the write-protect bit in the page table when in supervisor mode. Now, since Linux normally does copies from kernel to userspace by writing straight to userspace and letting the WP bit detect writes to read-only memory, it's a problem if the WP bit doesn't work (it'd let you overwrite write-protected userspace memory). So Linux had a check that tested (at boot time) whether WP worked properly in supervisor mode, and if so it would set a flag to perform a slower, software-checked copy.

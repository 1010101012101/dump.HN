You'll find you learn very fast when there is something specific you want to do and you don't know how.  So you should read books, certainly, but don't just work your way through books.<p>It doesn't matter super much what language you learn initially.  So if you have some friend who is an expert in another language, you might be better off learning that, then switching to Javascript once you know the basics of programming.",1205369948

135624,comment,135494,135517,0,0,domnit,,,"Learning a library is not the way I would recommend learning a language. At 12 years old, javascripter has no time constraint to build a product fast.<p>javascripter, learn about Javascript's language features. Learn about nested function and function passing. Learn about object-oriented Javascript and prototypes. Learn the difference between Javascript the language, and DOM, the thing within the language you use to add functionality to web pages. If you find that you are repeating things, write your own library.<p>Is this the first programming language you are learning? If so, it will give you a leg up when you learn a more conventional language like C or Java, because it will give your mind flexibility. If you already know a programming language, understand that different programming languages have different ideas about how programs can or should be expressed. (That's why there are so many languages.) It will sometimes be helpful to see how something in a new language is similar to a language you already know, but other times you have to just say to yourself, this is different, and I have to think a new way.",1205368748

Now, I usually stay updated with the topics via Google Reader and the # of forums I keep up with have dropped to maybe a handful. They mostly come in handy for when I'm searching for specific tech related subjects and certain good threads show up high ranking in the search engine.<p>List of forums: VMWare's VMTM Forums, Ubuntu's Forums, and Webmaster Forum at Digital Point are the top ones that come to mind.",1205368699

135619,comment,135596,135607,0,0,raju,,,"Agreed. Great read. And the second point<p>Leave Yourself a Place to Start (or: Leave work with something small broken)<p>is something I do all the time. I work Java at my day job, and have found that leaving out the semi-colon at the last place I touched (so that eclipse shows a compile error) really helps me get back to what I was doing the previous evening (or the friday before) so much quicker.<p>And the last point, get to know your tools. I am currently trying to learn emacs, but I have pretty much mastered eclipse (and other tools that I use). Not having to use the mouse to get to different views and perspectives to browsing around for files, absolutely necessary for improving your productivity at work.<p>In addition to the last point, getting to know additional tools outside of the development environment really helps. I read websites like lifehacker and have learned of tools like Launchy (on windows). Yes, it takes a while to get used to these tools, but once you have figured them out and configured them to your liking, you can really fly. Though i do get made fun of at work, considering the number of shortcut key combinations that I keep in my head. Invariably, someone will stop by to ask me for a key combo, and I have to type it out because a lot of the times its muscle memory.<p>[My apologies for the long post]",1205368008

135608,comment,135249,135249,0,0,Flemlord,,,"I ran into this situation about ten years ago. (With the <i>exact</i> same amount of seed funding and series A funding oddly.) I didn't want to do raises and my co-founder wanted to do a huge raise that would have doubled his salary. We compromised closer to my side and just did a slight raise.<p>We also sold some personal stock to the Series A investor. I banked it and forgot about it. He went on a spending spree and his performance at work went down and never recovered. He ended up quitting a year later, wrangling high-dollar consulting contracts from a couple of our larger clients who later regretted it. Asshole.<p>I suppose this is more of a lesson about picking the right founders than whether to give yourselves raises. But I'd be a bit wary of anyone who wants too large of a raise.",1205366427

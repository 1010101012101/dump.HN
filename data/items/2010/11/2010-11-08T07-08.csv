""The military stuff is kind of passe,"" Ms. Cummings said. ""It doesn't take a rocket scientist from MIT to tell you if we can do it for a soldier in the field, we can do it for anybody."" As a parent of a 3-year-old, she said, she could use the same technology to track her daughter on her way to school (she would need to plant an electronic bug in her lunch box or backpack). That would ""bring a whole new meaning to a hover parent,"" she said. Schools could even use drones for perimeter control.</i><p>I don't want my kids to be controlled by drones, I don't want kids to be looked behind on their way to school like animals. If you don't give a bit of freedom to your kids, if you are always on their back, they will never mature and reach adulthood. They will never have the feeling of freedom they need to develop themselves and be great creators, scientists, whatever. They will be sheep controlled by the sheepdog of the moment.",1289203195

It's the simplest and most versatile way to do async, load balanced services I have ever seen. Even for plain request/response it's way simpler than TCP alone and it does all of that without some huge bloated messaging middlware server infrastructure. It's just a simple in-process library. It really doesn't get much more complicated than what is shown in the article, even for things like pub/sub.<p>mongrel2 makes use of it in a very smart way as well. You don't need to tell mongrel2 about each and every backend process you're going to use. It's the other way around. The backend processes you start just connect to mongrel2 via ZeroMQ and bang they get their fair share of requests. The protocol is incredibly simple.

It may seem that way because 1) most of the hype for anything programming-related these days comes from back-end web developers, and 2) because back-end web developers are the primary audience of HN. At Rust meetups that I&#x27;ve attended I&#x27;ve seen interest in people doing video games, robotics, AI, numerical work, databases... they just don&#x27;t have as public and excitable a forum as this. :)",1418410716

Our product is a performance monitoring tool that runs inside of Rails apps, so it&#x27;s important to us to keep the overhead of our &quot;agent&quot; small and controllable.<p>Since the agent runs inside of a Ruby program, our only good choices are Ruby itself or a language without a garbage collector (embedding a language with a GC inside a language with GC is asking for trouble -- take a look at the bug tracker for TheRubyRacer for some color). Our initial version of the agent was written in Ruby, but carefully controlling memory usage or performance in Ruby isn&#x27;t really feasible.<p>We prototyped a new version of the agent in C++, but I personally didn&#x27;t feel comfortable shipping a binary that would run in thousands of customers&#x27; Rails apps in a language that could segfault if you&#x27;re not careful. We took Rust very seriously last November, even thought it was still very young, because it gave us a language with direct control over memory with compiler-verified guarantees that our program wouldn&#x27;t segfault.<p>TLDR: Rust is a very good choice for writing performance or memory-critical code that will be embedded in a high-level-language.<p>Also, because it offers compile-time guarantees about safety, I expect it to expand the number of cases where people feel justified in embedding a low-level language for performance-critical problems.",1418410676

In that case, I can see how it could be more annoying than the multiple return thing. I do not see, however, how tuples necessitate indexing - in the languages I&#x27;ve used with tuples, the arity is known at compile time, and you have to use certain functions to access the first, second, etc. But if the choice is between multiple returns (which I guess is just two values?) and tuples, then I don&#x27;t see why the common case (2-arity) can&#x27;t be easily supported.",1418410591

Post WW2 western European countries all benefited from something called the Marshall Plan from the US and of decades of productive cooperation in the EU, regardless of who did what in WW2, whereas the &quot;Eastern Block&quot; countries all got to endure &quot;retribution&quot; and being part of the unhealthy forced economy of the USSR.<p>International politics is something that should be taken separately from concepts such as &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;correctitude&quot; and &quot;punishing someone for one&#x27;s bad deeds&quot;.

[Chapter 2]</i><p>OK, so there are rays of hope at least.<p><i>4. There have been regional (much harsher) versions of the propaganda ban in effect for 7 years and there were only 2 convictions for violations of the regional laws and both were overturned. [Chapter 3]</i><p><i>5. In 6 months of the Federal Law there have been 3 convictions: 2 were acts of civil disobedience to challenge the legality of the law, the other is a story which you must read. [Chapter 3]</i><p>My understanding from people either in Russia recently (or from the FSU) is that it&#x27;s widely understood that these laws are at best barely enforceable (and perhaps not even intended to really enforced).  But that&#x27;s also precisely the point: they&#x27;re meant to have <i>symbolic</i> effect -- and the symbolic effect is generally taken to be quite chilling (like a shot across the bow, as it were).<p><i>6. Statistically you are far more likely to be the victim of an anti-LGBT Hate Crime in the United States than in Russia. [Chapter 4]</i><p>Seems dubious, given what my friends tell me.  Most likely these crimes simply aren&#x27;t reported, or the stats are suppressed (given the way crime stats are routinely manipulated in many countries, including the U.S.).<p><i>7. In Russia you cannot be fired from your job for being an LGBT individual, in the United States you can. [Chapter 4]</i><p>Possibly a valid point; I wouldn&#x27;t know.<p><i>8. Since 1993 gay sex was made legal in Russia, in 12 US States gay sex is a crime. [Chapter 4]</i><p>Technically correct (in that those laws are still on the books in some states).  But the more important fact is that the Supreme Court famously ruled these laws unconstitutional in 2010.  Which is a rather important omission for the author to make actually; it suggests he&#x27;s not really all that on top of things, as far as the basic status of gay rights in the U.S. are concerned.  (Or perhaps he does -- and is, again, playing semantic head games).<p><i>9. While President Obama says “I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them.” his policies demonstrate he has nothing but patience. [Chapter 5]</i><p>This, sadly, is basically true.  But it&#x27;s also an attemp to change the subject.<p><i>10. The group impacted most if found to be in violation of the law: Multinational corporations. [Chapter 6]</i><p>No.  It&#x27;s millions of LGBTs in the Russian Federation, young and old, unable to live their lives openly, and constitutionally protected from prosecution for simply being what they are.",1418408709

I realize this is at relatively low levels of penetration, but their uptake has been extremely rapid and tech progression has been quick. Solar is still expensive as fuck, but everyone knows that. Look at those variable O&M costs though, those are some sexy zeroes if you can lock in your other costs adequately.<p>Pages 10 and 11 here [2](warning, pdf), discuss wind curtailment in MISO, where they&#x27;ve tackled the curtailment problem head-on with great success. They also estimate that they can keep manual curtailment incredibly low until wind doubles in capacity from the time of the report. The intermittentency is not overwhelming until you have much more wind in the system than we currently do. Additionally, there are exiting traditional storage techniques that don&#x27;t get much traction for a variety of reasons (like pumped storage), which we could build out hard if we actually needed to.<p>A healthy mix of renewables, storage technology, grid upgrades, and more efficient traditional generation technologies would leave us in a fine position.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrel.gov%2Fdocs%2Ffy14osti%2F60983.pdf&ei=fC6LVOWGIoWxyQSz9oG4Dw&usg=AFQjCNEy89XmStkVVRMwFMfx91TwP78Lfw&sig2=-g9dh3myK0l8mh-NZeWmPA&bvm=bv.81828268,d.aWw&cad=rja"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd...</a><p>Hmm, never been downvoted before for providing a sourced comment with relevant information.

The comparison isn&#x27;t &quot;jornalctl&quot; vs &quot;less /var/log/messages&quot;. jornalctl should respect $PAGER (it does), and it should similarly respect any other environment variable the user sets.<p>If there really was a need to override behavior of the pager for just this one tool, the normal solution should be to locally override these cases:<p><pre><code>   alias journalctl=&quot;LESS=&#x27;...opts...&#x27; journalctl&quot;
</code></pre>
It is worth pointing out that this solution works for <i>any</i> tool that uses the $PAGER, and isn&#x27;t specific to journalctl. If, for some strange reason that isn&#x27;t an acceptable solution (such as Lennart&#x27;s hatred of shell scripting - which he&#x27;s entitled to, if that&#x27;s the way he wants HIS environment to work), then a far better solution would be, as you suggest, two variables in priority order. It&#x27;s a trivial change: [pager.c:92]<p><pre><code>    -    less_opts = getenv(&quot;SYSTEMD_LESS&quot;);
    +    less_opts = getenv(&quot;SYSTEMD_LESS&quot;) || getenv(&quot;LESS&quot;);
</code></pre>
This makes no assumptions about what the user intended and accepts either their general or specific settings, if present. This IS done for the $SYSTEMD_PAGER / $PAGER at [pager.c:59] making it somewhat strange that similar behavior wasn&#x27;t also used for $LESS.<p>TL&DR: Setting defaults when $LESS isn&#x27;t present is fine. Overriding behavior when a special, tool-specific request is also fine. Requiring everybody to search documentation and set a new environment variable to restore the standard, expected behavior is lazy and rude.<p>I set $LESS (and $PAGER, and $EDITOR, $VISUAL, $LESSOPEN, ...) for a reason, and the value(s) change depending on what I&#x27;m working on[1]. Overriding these should never be done as default behavior, or it is creating extra work for no reason. Assuming you know WHY I override $LESS (or any other environment variable) is always bad behavior, because you cannot know what all possible requirements that everybody will have.<p>// yet another reason I don&#x27;t consider systemd to be usable<p>pager.c:92 <a href=""http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd-stable/tree/src/shared/pager.c?h=v217-stable#n92"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd-stable/tree/src/...</a><p>pager.c:59 <a href=""http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd-stable/tree/src/shared/pager.c?h=v217-stable#n59"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd-stable/tree/src/...</a><p>[1] I use custom tool that can push/pop environment variable overlays, which setup use/project specific behavior for a lot of stuff... including the pager.",1418408133

For example, you wouldn&#x27;t get EITC if you had no income, but you wouldn&#x27;t get food stamps if you had $100k/yr.<p>I would argue that it&#x27;s poor framing to compare a hypothetical family with $0/yr. income to one with $100k/yr. income.  You bring up childcare as an example, but when you look at a family making, say, $35k/yr., they&#x27;re largely unqualified for assistance but childcare is almost certainly out of reach for them.  $100k/yr. families are paying for childcare, paying tons of taxes, and buying amazing Christmas gifts.<p>Because only 20% of Americans even make >= $100k/yr., I don&#x27;t think you can rightly call them middle class.  I&#x27;m not sure we should really be concerned for those at that income level, I think it&#x27;s more imperative to start looking at people working full time but still making < $35k/yr.  Is there an upper-middle class treadmill?  Yeah sure, I&#x27;m not even sure what your argument is, that you&#x27;re not getting rich?  Regardless, a treadmill is much better than the alternatives.  You imply that until you make $150k/yr., you may as well make $0/yr.  This is really just untrue; probably (depending on number of children) it&#x27;s untrue until you get down around $20k/yr., which is where you start getting into living wage argument territory.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m with you on progressive taxation.

8741696,comment,8740287,8740287,0,0,phasetransition,,,"Regardless of how much you hate (or love) nuclear power, it is important to remember that radioactive decay is a stochastic process that doesn&#x27;t give a crap about politics, policy, or nation states. As such, any prudent forward looking nuclear path needs to include methodology to transmute the unfortunate nuclide spectrum left over from light water reactors (LWR) into shorter lived species that don&#x27;t need storage measured in epochs. New nuclear reactor technology with different neutron spectrums is likely the most prudent approach to effect this transmutation at scale.<p>The &quot;green movement&quot; anti-nuclear camp cannot seem to see the scientific need to continue with nuclear fission at least long enough to clean up most of the mess we&#x27;ve already created. A coherent &quot;full stop&quot; nuclear policy should still include reprocessing and transmutation of the existing waste stockpile. Stopping short of this makes the extant waste problem catastrophically worse.<p>---<p>I took radiochemistry in graduate school several years before the the origin story in the Brooking&#x27;s article, and the appeal of molten salt reactors was well known then, albeit with more conventional fuel loads.<p>The engineer in me gravitates towards the elegance of the proposed &quot;Gen IV+&quot; nuclear technologies, but the convoluted realities of nuclear power in today&#x27;s form makes it hard for me to justify continuing the current path towards bigger and bigger light water reactors.<p>My personal opinion is that we need to diverge from, or stop, the building of ever larger LWR. Because these reactors operate at elevated pressure, and have multi-megawatt levels of decay heat, accidents are always a specter.<p>Research energy must then be diverted into technologies that will consume most of the long lived TRU waste. By the time the existing waste is transmuted, the performance of the transmuting reactor systems will be established enough that retaining or shuttering of those systems should be more clear. There will also be a long enough stretch of time in parallel to ascertain the asymptotic maturity state of the various renewable energy technologies.",1418407774

There was just one particular day where I was struggling with a concept and I felt like people were making fun of me and it just really made me not want to touch Rust for a few months.<p>But that&#x27;s not really the point. I think the point is that there&#x27;s a need for a sort of onboarding process for people who have never had to deal with some of these basic concepts. For instance, in web development, there&#x27;s not a lot of need to know much about ownership or memory. The popular languages (Java, PHP, Python) kinda handle those things for you. So when you dig into Rust, you spend a lot of time thinking things like &quot;wtf is a pointer?&quot; and &quot;wtf is a reference?&quot; instead of actually building something useful.<p>That&#x27;s a really frustrating part for me. I can build anything I want in PHP or Python or Java. I know those languages like the back of my hand, and if you give me a problem, I can solve it.<p>But then I start with a language like Rust, which concerns itself with all kinds of things I&#x27;ve only vaguely heard of, and then I&#x27;m completely lost. Super, super, super frustrating. It&#x27;s a struggle to do a basic blackjack game -- something I could do in my sleep with Python!<p>So you don&#x27;t know these concepts, which is already frustrating, and then you go into chat and you say &quot;WTF is a pointer?&quot; and hopefully people say &quot;Oh, dude, it&#x27;s so easy, imagine. you have this...&quot; instead of &quot;That&#x27;s basic computer science, man.

All my non-technical friends are very fed-up with how apps, apple, android, <walled-garden-buzzword> work.<p>I constantly hear them chattering about how they would like to do <action> but stupid <apple/android> doesn&#x27;t allow them do said action. A recent example of the other day was something about how apple blue-tooth is somehow not compatible with a windows devices or something along those lines.<p>Perhaps right now walled-garden devices are still profitable, but if they continue to become more limited it won&#x27;t take long for a suitable (more open) alternative to appear.<p>As for your second point, I find it somewhat paradoxical, I assume you would agree with me that computers are becoming more and more common (including smart phones). And yet you think that the knowledge _about_ computers will decrease?<p>Perhaps the obliviousness of the people around you have become more apparent because of the ubiquitousness of computing these days. But to say it has _increased_ would imply that that group was knowledgeable in the first place, which is not the case. Also since more and more people are born that have been around computers their entire lives, I find it very doubtful that less of those people will end-up learning about computers than before when it was strictly the domain of &quot;nerds&quot;.",1418407251

After the two years, we swing into a yearly performance review that&#x27;s tied to a salary increase dependent on role and performance for the previous year. Also, at that point, our profit sharing kicks in as well.<p>I think that that is fairly generous and keeps me from having to ask for a raise, at least for a few years. The raise I&#x27;m guaranteed for the 6 months over two years is 6%. After that, again, it&#x27;s TBD, but even if it was 3% with profit sharing it&#x27;s still a good raise.<p>A yearly raise is pretty standard, I&#x27;d say.

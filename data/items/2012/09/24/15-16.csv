4565225,comment,4562211,4563255,1,0,hntester123,,,"That's an interesting idea: to only catch exceptions at a very high level (for fast prototyping). I tried it out with this test program:<p><a href=""http://pastie.org/4791686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/4791686</a><p>Though it works, one potential issue I found with it is that it does not give enough context as to where in the program the exception occurred. E.g. if I have more than one open()  call (all for read mode) in the code, it will give the same error message for an exception occurring on any of those open() calls (as long as the exceptions all happen for the same underlying reason, such as ""file not found"". E.g.:<p>Exception occurred:\nIOError(2, 'No such file or directory')<p>Had you come across this and found any way to handle it? I though of passing some unique code for each case, but there seems to be no way to do it, because we are not calling the except clause ourselves - Python does it.<p>Edit: just thought of a (crude) way to handle that issue: declare a global variable, say, ""location"", and set it to a different numeric or string value at each place in the code where an exception may be thrown, or at least at one place, say the top of the function, in each function or method. And then in the single except clause, print the value:<p>print ""location="", location<p>This will at least help narrow down the area of code in which the exception was thrown.",1348501932

It is quite clear by now that SHA-1 and MD5 are flawed, so the 'higher version' SHA-2 variants (especially the bigger ones) should be preferred.<p>> So fast is good but it often comes as a compromise against security and any new standard should at least be better than what it is designed to replace and not open up whole new avenues of attack.<p>Brute force attacks against 512 bit hashes are not practical today, and won't be practical for a long time. The concern with password storage is seldom pure brute force attacks, but rather attacks against a dictionary. This is because, for password storage, the input entropy is typically much less than 512 bits (or even 128 bits). It's a completely different use case.<p>> Its is tha aspect of being able to get a large hashed file and modify part of that file and recheck just that partial HASH without having to rehash the whole thing.<p>Is this an argument against hash trees?

But I'd argue that while Android should remain open source (you can use the source once it's ready), it should be even more ""closed"", in the sense that Google needs to have a lot more control over what the manufacturers/their partners can do with Android.<p>Why? Because it's the only way to ensure a cohesive ""ecosystem"" that helps not only Google and their Android users, but also the manufacturers themselves in the long run. After all, if everyone had their own little fork of Android, and there wouldn't be an ""ecosystem"" anymore, that wouldn't benefit them at all, as these days it's all about ""platform wars"", and splitting one big platform into 10 different ones would actually hurt the manufacturers, not help them.<p>This is why I think Google needs to ""close"" Android even more i.e. standardize it a lot more, and even demand from manufacturers to release their drivers. It would be awesome if they told them to release open source drivers, but even closed source ones would be useful, because if everyone did this, Android could actually (eventually) work like Windows.<p>You would be able to install ""Android"" on any 2-3 year old smartphone or tablet. But that's only if the manufacturers would be forced to release those drivers and maintain the support for that amount of time. And that's only possible if the Android ecosystem becomes a little tigher/more closed, or ""less open"" (as in manufacturers can't do whatever they want, and they must obey a set of rules for the well being of the ecosystem).",1348501564

Apple wasn't able to gain as much exponential growth in market-share as the IBM-compatible/MS combo.<p>Cut to today - Apple risks losing the fight against Google, largely because Google have produced a product (Android) that's sold (in kind) as a compliment to commodity hardware (made by a host of hardware manufacturers).<p>Apple is repeating history.",1348501535

4565187,comment,4563914,4563914,4,0,jbert,,,"Can someone who uses exceptions in large systems offer a comment on <i>which</i> exceptions they throw?<p>One of the problems I have in trying to design with exceptions is that they seem to offer a lot of potential to break abstraction layers.<p>As a concrete example, if you have a cacheing layer which - say - is implemented over the filesystem. In the event of an inability to access the correct location, the low-level routines might throw a permission-related exception. If you swap out the filesystem cacheing implementation with, say, one based on memcached you might instead get a network-related exception.<p>Neither of these types really make sense in the context of a 'cacheing layer error', they seem to leak implementation details - breaking the abstraction.<p>Do people accept this, or do they catch-and-rethrow new exception types at major layer boundaries? (e.g. in the above two implementations, both low-level exceptions may be caught and rethrown as ""CacheInitialisationError"" with some perhaps some additional diagnostic about the underlying cause). If they have such API-specific error types, do you go to the trouble of modelling an exception type hierarchy? So all your 'cache layer' exceptions inherit from 'CacheError' so a higher level can catch all ""CacheExceptions"" in one place? This seems like a lot of additional modelling effort, is it commonplace?<p>To my mind, the possible exceptions a API call may make (or equivalently, the errors it could return) are <i>part</i> of the API, and the errors need to be at the same conceptual level as the rest of the API. (So you can't have filesystem errors in a generic cache API).<p>What happens in practice?",1348501458

In a world were we still have no standard in ragards of BIG or LITTLE ENDIAN then you can see they took the right approach.<p>Only aspect that Mr Schneier has not highlighted and which you touched upon is that some of the hashing finalists are faster and in that they will in brute force comparisions be not as good.   That is another consideration, albeit one of limited time as you already said AES is now in some hardware as instructions and how long since AES being a standard has that taken.<p>But the whole ability to work on partial blocks and that is what you need to do to gain from parallelisation does open up a while new ballgame in modifiying hashed code and returning the same hash.

But the Oslo metro region for example, outside of a tiny city core, consists largely of tiny little towns with mostly single or dual residency houses, terraces and a few low apartment buildings. Larger apartment blocks are found some places too, but most commonly in the centre of Oslo. There are large stretches of pretty much empty space - forest or farms. Density for the region as a whole is driven up substantially by the city of Oslo itself.<p>The Bay Area on the other hand, at least has most of the population clustered around a handful of major transport links, even though the towns spread out more than a similarly sized city usually would in Europe.

An organization like NIST has a responsibility to have an opinion on what the 'best' hash function is. They then need to track the state of the art of research that might invalidate that decision, and clearly communicate changes in the decision. While there is a defense-in-depth argument to be made for multiple options, the pattern seems to have been that there are a lot more systems broken because they chose a poorly studied or known bad algorithm than by breaks being found in previously known-good algorithms.

That will be necessary for any real-time audio application like NES emulation. Ultimately, this should be solved with the Web Audio API, but so far that appears to implemented in Firefox/Chrome/Safari, and only partly in those. I can see a Flash shim being useful there.<p>Now, in the mean time, I do have an idea of how this might be implemented on top of Riffwave.js, but it's iffy. The problem is that while the HTML5 audio element does have some events that tell you about playback status, we cannot possibly rely on JS events (or the placement of new audio tags) to give us the temporal granularity needed for audio timing. If you mistime the beginning of one block from the end of the previous block by half a millisecond, you'll hear an audible pop.<p>So one possible solution would be to crossfade blocks, using an overlap period on the same order as your timing uncertainty. In the cleverest implementation, the timing uncertainty would be continually measured and the overlap size would be adapted to be as low as possible.<p>But that's not a perfect solution. It would ameliorate the problem, but it would also introduce its own artifacts. For example, if you have a 440 Hz sine wave playing, and one block is offset by the next by 1.13 ms, then at the midpoint between two blocks (where each block is at 50% volume), the waves will interfere completely, resulting in a point of silence.

That is nice.<p>But when it comes to brute forcing then being faster works against you, also the ability to work on partial chunks of the data allows you to modify the code and rechecking the partial hash for the part your changing until you get the same result, this alows you to do nasty things to code and get the official hash answear alot easier than having to rehash the end result every time and getting the same result or modifying the code to get the same result (usualy have area you jump over all nop and modify that to influence the hash, but more sane ways to do this but offtopic).<p>So in essence any hash that can be run faster in any way will make it weaker in terms of brut forcing (yes I know people assume there passwords will be the last one on the list to be checked bia brute forcing and assume if it takes 10 years to test all variations then there password is 10 years strong, you see the flaw in mentality there).<p>Now NIST still have an opertunity here and it is a simple, tried and tested approach and that would be to have all finalists winners and have them all in the standard as variations.  This then allows end users/admins to pick there variation of choice or even perish the thought allow mixed usage so say your /etc/password file could have some users using one variation, others using another, etc.  Whilst it add's no obvious extra benifit, it will allow more variations and in that fallbacks/choice and that is what n BIT encryption/hashing is all about, each bit being a choice in a way.<p>So in summary I believe NIST should let them all win and have SH3.n with n being the variation of finalist, let them all win, choice is good and that is what n bit encryption is after all, extra choices.",1348499906

I was basically throwing up my hands. And while I like CL's system, I haven't come close to trying everything out there so I can't be a judge; I mean this not like a cop out but seriously, I am very poorly informed about what other languages have to offer.<p>But since you ask: I guess if I was trying to convince someone that exceptions are inherently a better mechanism, I would start by exploring how arithmetic is handled in the C language.  Let's say we have a function called ""add"" that adds two numbers.  Typically we would think expect that the return value of such a function should hold the result of that addition.  It would be naive, however, to expect add to always complete without something like an error happening.  While addition of two numbers seems safe, it isn't when we start using our imperfect number representations such as floating point numbers (susceptible to overflow, underflow, loss of precision, and more) but also with machine sized integers (susceptible to overflow) and even bigints (what happens if we attempt to add two numbers and exhaust system heap space?).  The way these are currently handled in the C language (to the best of my knowledge) is by three different mechanisms: 1) floats return special floats that say indicate that there was an error somewhere, like NaN (though you can probably instruct your OS/hardware/whatever to issue these as signals instead of silently spitting out an NaN), 2) wrap-around is loosely taken as a standard but truly it has undefined consequences, your code must guarantee that this cannot happen, and 3) the program will probably exit.  This is messy but we have learned to deal with it and has become second nature to C programmers; but that doesn't means it is good.<p>But this doesn't need to be the case, we could use the return value checking that is being promulgated by some here.  We can define add as...<p>error_code add(int a, int b, int *return)<p>...where int could be any number type and translate every occurrence of ""a+b"" in our code into something like...<p>int ret;\nif (err = add(a,b,&ret))\n{\n  // err handling here\n}\n// ret holds the answer here<p>I cannot believe this is preferable to anybody, in fact I am going to go out on a limb and say that it isn't.  Instead we just trust this to work when we know that there are instances where it won't and, in the case of floating point math, it is extremely common for you to hit those cases where it doesn't work.  If we were serious about writing code that handled these errors gracefully, our C code would be unmaintainable.  If we were honest about the source of this laziness, I think we would say that this is due to the syntactic and mental overhead of the error handling.  The fact that we don't code like this, even the very fact that C will spit out an NaN and propagate it along indefinitely, is proof in point that people dislike this type of ""check the return value"" error handling.  This is C more or less pushing us to write code that is less robust.<p>If we really wanted to consider what happens in a Common Lisp system, you would have a function ""add"" that takes two numbers and will always return the correct result of that addition or won't return at all.  This means no wrap around overflow, no NaNs; this is vastly cleaner.  However, as far as I know, this has nothing to do with CL in particular, this is presumably how Python or any language with a exceptions works.  This is what I cannot fathom: that there are people that are willing to throw away this simplifying assumption because it means that your code might have controlled non-local transfer of execution. This is what Joel on Software directly says (linked elsewhere in this thread); exception handling is like goto, goto is bad, even when it is contained within an apparatus fixes its problems, like the exception handling apparatus.  Or that people think the same amount of work is involved in either system?  How does that make sense?  Which way would you rather treat something like ""add(a, add(b, add(c, d)))"" because to my eye the C style handling adds a bunch of boiler plate code that I'd rather not write while adding little to no value.  Like I was saying, I cannot fathom it so it is hard to form an argument against the alternative stance that I do not understand.  Perhaps there are places where we want our execution so close to the structure of the code that handling errors C style makes sense, but I have to imagine that they are few and far between.<p>If we compare a more common example where people will place error handlers: writing to a file.  Is it better to have writefile(file, data) return an int that indicates error, or is it better to just say ""writefile puts this data in file, period"".  Here are two errors that might come up when writing to a file, we don't have write permission for that file or the disk is full.  Where do you want to handle these errors?  One error happens when we open it, the other happens when we attempt to write to it further down the call tree, but presumably we might want to catch both and deal with them at the same location.  With exceptions you catch/handle the exceptions you are interested in.  When returning error codes you have to manually defer the error up the call tree, affecting the interface of every calling function up to the highest function that can actually handle the error.  So you can add the boiler plate code to combine and propagate errors up the call tree to your task list now.  At the root of this is the exact same issue as the previous point, it adds syntactic and mental overhead for the programmer.<p>This article seems to have spawned some responses.  Consider this post:\n<a href=""http://www.yosefk.com/blog/error-codes-vs-exceptions-critical-code-vs-typical-code.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yosefk.com/blog/error-codes-vs-exceptions-critica...</a>\nHe makes claims like in the code...<p>open_the_gate()\nwait_for_our_men_to_come_in()\nclose_the_gate()<p>...if there is an exception inside wait_for_our_men_to_come_in then we'll never close the gate.  While this is true for the code he's written, most people would (or should) consider that code buggy.  In my experience and the comments of that post confirm it, most languages have a mechanism to ensure certain side effects happen even under non-local control transfer.  Where are the points of intermediate state that he render exceptions equally bad as error codes?  Are they the states that we explicitly account for in any bug free program, like closing the gate if there is an problem bringing the men in?  I will reiterate, I truly am at a loss, this is not a rhetorical question.  It seems like I am missing something.<p>To sum up:  One method seems like a clean method of dealing with errors that will happen, the other seems like a nightmare syntactically and basically consists of code that I deeply feel should be up to a compiler to write.",1348499597

Exceptions allow one to separate error handling from the structure of the ""mainline"" execution path of an algorithm. Weaving if/else statements in and out of the mainline path of an algorithm muddies the intent. Exceptions help with this greatly. Instead of having to comprehend the entirety of the algorithm (when exception handling can sometimes take up 50% or more of the code), you can zero in on the most common execution path.

One simple example of this is ruby's fork statement, which runs the code in the block in a process of its own:<p><pre><code>    fork { puts ""child"" }\n    puts ""parent""\n</code></pre>\nThat will print ""child"" and ""parent"" once each, and it works because the fork method has control over the block's execution, so it can choose to only evaluate the block in the child's context.  In python, the approximate code would be:<p><pre><code>    with fork():\n      print 'child'\n    print 'parent'\n</code></pre>\nHowever, python doesn't allow the resource to control block execution, so this code can't work (within standard python; there's a bytecode hack that can make it work, but that's outside the spec).  Anyhow, I guess we've diverged pretty hard from the article, but I can never pass up the opportunity to vent against python's <i>with</i> statement.",1348499388

I was pointing out that when GP found it unfair for people to be called spoiled for wanting to live in the centre of SF because the rest of the Bay Area is somehow a desolate wasteland where you'll need to ""endure"" the horros of 10-18 minute drives, that was pretty much demonstrating exactly why some of us thinks people complaining about that <i>are</i> spoiled.<p>As such I won't address most of the points of your reply, as I happen to agree with most of them - they just aren't very relevant to the point of comment. Again: I'm not arguing it wouldn't be better with more public transport, nor that Bay Area's public transport is good enough, nor that it's not more convenient if you have a car. I am arguing, however, that there are <i>large</i> areas of the Bay Area outside of SF that are perfectly liveable <i>even</i> for someone like me without a drivers license, and that a large part of the reason why people whine about the cost of living in SF <i>is</i> exactly that they are spoilt. If it's possible to live in these areas without a car, it is certainly possible to live very well in these places <i>with</i> one.<p>> sure, when you're only visiting, you don't have kids, etc. Many people aren't amenable to having a minimum half hour walk to get anywhere, and if your grocery store is anything but close by, you're in trouble if you don't go shopping every few days (having a grocery store every few blocks is one of my favorite things about high density living situations).<p>Some points to this:<p>While there are certainly parts of the Bay Area where I'd be far more isolated, I don't live within a short walk of a big grocery store or a train station or most other amenities. I have 15 minutes to the nearest proper grocery store, 20 minutes to the nearest train station, though there is a bus route reasonably nearby that is faster <i>if</i> I hit it on time. This is in one of the most densely populated parts of England, in a London suburb that is indeed zoned not all that differently from many Bay Area towns, with huge areas of single residence houses or terraced houses (so one or two shared walls, but still one resident per plot of land). There are huge areas of the Bay Area that are no worse to live in in terms of amenities. Sure, you're more likely to have to resort to a car for commuting.<p>In terms of kids, we have a 3 year old son. To pick him up from nursery after work, it takes me about 2 hours to get home: Two trains + two buses to get to the nursery, plus two buses to get home. I know how much effort having a kid adds to any kind of transport situation. We frequently take him to a part 20-25 minutes walk away. On foot, again, meaning when he gets too tired to walk, we carry him. I might get a drivers license. No so much for my day to day situation, but to be able to take day trips etc. to places that are a pain to get to by public transport. But living this way works perfectly fine.<p>So yes, some people might not be ""amenable"" to living this way, but unless they're old or disabled, the are perfectly <i>able to</i> to do so and still have an enjoyable life. I'm not saying people should opt to live the way I do, but I am saying that complaining about the cost of living if they instead <i>choose</i> to live somewhere with ridiculous house prices just to avoid having to walk, cycle or drive a bit longer to get places does make them seem spoiled to me.<p>> No, it won't work unless you're paying hundreds for a cab, you get a friend to drive you, or you head home at like 6 in the evening.<p>Well, it did work for us, so clearly it does. And no, we did none of those. Instead we did what I've done in many other cities in the world out of ""necessity"" if you want to stay out late: Stay out long enough to have a reasonably short wait to take the bus home, which is what we did. (Incidentally, if you don't want that, it's still far cheaper to find a cheap motel near public transport in SF and sleep it off until things start running than it is to take a cab to places even much closer than Santa Cruz).<p>The Greyhound ride to Santa Cruz was obnoxiously unnecessarily long and a bizarre experience (checking in to a bus?!? and a half hour break in the middle... wow). It sucked, other than for the novelty. But so does the alternatives in a lot of other places including many with substantially higher population density than the Bay Area. Again, the point is that expecting quick and short transit to everywhere and everything <i>is</i> being spoiled. There are few places you can do that outside of major world cities like London. Even London isn't all that great in this respect if you don't live ""just right"" (I'm ""lucky"" - there are hourly night buses to within about 20 minutes walk from where I live). I grew up outside Oslo, and frequently ended up spending 30-40 minutes to walk to the station followed by 3+ hours in sub-zero temperatures after clubs closed in Oslo before the first trains started to run. That was normal, unless you wanted to spend extortionate amounts on a cab (far higher rates than in the Bay Area for similar distances) which I couldn't afford then.<p>> Sure, but that's a pretty useless definition of spoiled; essentially any non-utilitarian aspect of living would fall under it.<p>No, it's a definition of spoiled that compares your expectations with the expectations of people in similar situations elsewhere, where these kinds of obstacles are just as common, yet somehow wast amounts of people manage just fine. When people complain that they pay far too much despite being able to afford to live somewhere most people can't and opt to do that rather than moving to somewhere that's still vastly better than what most people can afford to free up spare cash, then, yes, that's being spoilt.<p>> And this shows the real reason behind your post: you were staying in a hotel on El Camino :) Head up into one of the neighborhoods nearby and suddenly nothing is nearby.<p>I know perfectly well that there are places in the Bay Area where a car is a perfect necessity. An ex manager of mine lived in the middle of the forest near Santa Cruz, for example. That there are places that are extremely hard to live in without a car is entirely besides the point.<p>I stayed in hotels on El Camino a couple of times, yes. But most of the times I did not. You might argue that if I just had a bit further to walk to <i>get to</i> El Camino, I'd change my mind. Maybe I would. But that still leaves a few million people who live in areas within walking distance from enough stuff. Even so, walking distance was not the main point, as note above. The main point was that seemingly considering it a pain to live in these kind of places <i>is</i> being spoilt.",1348499192

I've been having trouble with passion too and though I'm starting to get glimmers of it back through this approach, I can't yet claim I have ""come back with a bang"".<p>PS: Just in case you are literally ""feeling tired of <i>everything.</i>"", you might want to check in on basic health stuff - food/sleep/exercise - get a check-up from a doctor for any illness, and also see if you are suffering from depression. But I've assumed you just meant tired of everything, in programming.",1348498931

Our first version spidered out for the content but a far more efficient way was to upload compressed version of the data from the user as we can then do hash checks for reference counting. Chrome extension has been used in the wild for last 3 months on 6 continents. Firefox extension too unstable at the moment(also Mozilla ten day review process), but hope to get it out with 1-2 weeks. Would love any feedback, good or bad!",1348498882

Which incidentally is a useless mechanism for error handling unless you have some kind of destruction semantics, which is mentioned in the article. Anyway, given the choice between exceptions and return values for error handling, I go for return values that the compiler can force me to check.",1348498880

In neutrino experiments we've gotten pretty good at synchronized clocks with nanosecond resolution.  Although (to be fair) we cheat and get some very useful information out of the beam itself, and neutrinos luckily don't travel on optical fibers.  I'd be interested to research what it would actually take to provide nanosecond synchronization of clocks in at least a dozen data centers globally, distributed to millions of servers.",1348498862

I, for one, don't see how anything critical can rely on the single memory allocator that came bundled with the compiler.",1348498844

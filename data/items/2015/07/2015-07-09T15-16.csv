9858677,comment,9857250,9857250,0,0,brandonb,,,"We know shockingly little about nutrition, but this paper is a great summary of what we do know from both association studies and randomized trials:
<a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/123/24/2870.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/123/24/2870.full</a><p>In particular, table 2 summarizes what we know about each type of food (sodium, saturated fat, trans fat, carbs, sugar, ...) and what type of study we know it from (e.g., randomized trial or association study?): <a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/123/24/2870/T2.expansion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/123/24/2870/T2.expansion...</a>)<p>The best type of evidence you could have is a randomized trial of clinical end points--divide people randomly into (say) low fat and low carb diets, run the study for a few years, and measure what percentage of people have a heart attack. That&#x27;s column 4, and it&#x27;s nearly empty. The only things we seem to know are that total fat seems to be neutral, and substituting polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat reduces heart attacks.<p>In the absence of that gold standard evidence, we&#x27;re relying on weaker but more convenient types of study designs -- randomized trials that measure surrogate metrics (e.g., blood cholesterol and blood pressure), or various types of association studies.<p>As of now, those seem to be telling us that alcohol, dietary fiber, and unsaturated fats help our risk factors for a heart attack, and trans fats, sodium, carbs, and cholesterol make our risk factors worse. But those conclusions can easily change since they&#x27;re based on a surrogate, and indeed, we&#x27;ve already seen the recommendation against eating cholesterol reversed:

Changing lighting for instance is huge.<p>However, there will always be a certain subgroup of people that have a sort mentality, based on maybe mammal instinct, that if you mark a small amount of territory in a public space, it belongs to you to and you can therefore use it in any way you like for however long you like until someone challenges you for the territory and wins. This type of person, when armed with a laptop and cell phone, becomes a particularly obnoxious problem when they&#x27;re a coffee shop nomad. Moms with strollers often fall into the same category, but it&#x27;s a social minefield raising the issue in public.<p>Anyhow this is why coffee shop owners, no matter how hard they try, will not be able to remove a small malignant group of knowledge working nomads without a daily fight.

For any reasonably sized organization, ensuring that users get provisioned / deprovisioned is a tricky, error-prone task. Having IAM as a single toggle is nice. Using their SAML integration into something like Okta, OneLogin, or other IaaS-providers ... even better. Getting user activity into centralized logging via CloudTrail (Splunk, Sumo, ELK, et al.) is best practice for security teams. AWS makes all of this pretty easy, but at a price.",1436457561

Greece&#x27;s GDP has tanked since 2008, why would you expect spending/GDP to fall even if they made cuts?

There&#x27;s no real difference between a for-profit railroad monopoly that depends on government subsidies, and a nationalized railway system.

For instance, the work US military contractors do would be considered government work in Europe. So you can&#x27;t simply compare the government-to-GDP ratios between countries.<p>When it comes to austerity the issue is the change in government spending, not the size of the government. The sudden change is what shocks the economy. Government spending in Greece went down by a lot, services got cut, salaries got cut, pensions got cut.

If netflix kills TV nobody is going to license them content.<p>Having been with Netflix since before it even supported streaming, as well as through the whole streaming period, the catalog has <i>lost</i> a lot of high-quality back catalog (and is less successful at acquiring new third-party content), in part because content owners are trying to monetize their content through other channels, including their own streaming services. Netflix could live off third-party back catalog content as long as it was essentially alone in the streaming space -- which only lasted as long as that mechanism was a relatively unproven business model.<p>Note that the <i>exact same thing</i> happened to HBO, which, before it started making original content, was essentially the cable-era version of what Netflix was before <i>it</i> started making original content. But once there were other cable movie channels, HBO needed unique content that it didn&#x27;t have to get into price wars with other channels -- since these bidding wars meant that the profit was squeezed out of HBO (or the competing channel) to the content owner.<p>> But I&#x27;m not sure that Netflix&#x27;s subscriber base is signed up for Netflix becoming another HBO.<p>Short of price-managed mandatory streaming license system, Netflix becoming another HBO was guaranteed if Netflix was successful in demonstrating that streaming was a viable way of delivering the kind of content it was carrying.

Boilerplate generators are annoying, and Valgrind is difficult to use, but they&#x27;re unrefined: they solve problems that are best avoided than solved.<p>A better measure of sophistication is how much bang you get for the buck, and how much of this bang is made possible by the language itself.<p>In my opinion, the best example of this is GHCi: Using GHCi almost feels like asking the computer &quot;Is what I&#x27;m doing right?&quot;. GHCi itself is made possible by Haskell&#x27;s excellent balance between type system expressiveness and making inference feasible. To see why maximizing raw expressive power won&#x27;t help, in most dependently typed languages, it&#x27;s hard to construct nontrivial meaningful utterances, so you don&#x27;t even get to the point where you can ask &quot;Is what I&#x27;m doing right?&quot; - the type checker will tell you &quot;It isn&#x27;t even wrong&quot;. That being said, I&#x27;m aware that the situation w.r.t. tooling is improving a lot.<p>Another example is Rust&#x27;s borrow checker: It will tell you exactly at which point an equivalent C or C++ program would have had a dangling pointer. It doesn&#x27;t quite have the same &quot;fluid conversation&quot; feel as using GHCi, but it saves the enormous amount of time that would&#x27;ve been otherwise spent chasing memory bugs in a debugger, especially in a concurrent program.<p>Ruby isn&#x27;t <i>defined</i> by poor tools.

For me it&#x27;s been enough to turn me off them all together and make it a talking point that &quot;my javascript skills fall off at X,Y or Z&quot; so recruiters and employers know that despite being able to do a lot, I can&#x27;t suddenly become everything UI and everything back end just because the title of anything &quot;front end&quot; is so versatile.",1436456459

I tried this with our consultancy a few times and they never seem to pay off, even when we did it on linkedin.  Although at least with linkedin, we did connect to people and it helped expand our network.<p>Almost all of our clients come from networking and meeting people.  You have to put yourself out there.  Then from there you will also get referrals etc.  Getting sales is still personal, especially if you are asking for $10k+, people want to feel they know you a little or know someone that knows you.<p>As for your pricing, if it were me, I&#x27;d likely put it as &quot;starting at&quot; and pick a reasonable number (gives you flexibility too).  Or give general guidelines, like &quot;typical 3 page website developed in approximately 2-3 weeks $xxxxx.&quot;  Or whatever the real facts you feel are.  But that way it is less a rigid structure and more a guide for people that are interested.  Giving examples like this I think doesn&#x27;t scare people, but when they see 1-3 pages $25k for a mobile app, they aren&#x27;t sure what that means but it seems expensive.  Remember, the first thing someone does is take whatever numeric metric you put on your price and divide it into your price, so in this case they would say each screen is costing them $8,333, which will scare them.  This is just human nature.<p>For example, we price per week (or per day for small things), and the first thing everyone does is divide our rate into 40 hours or 8 hours for the day.  But for us our weekly hours commitment is 30hrs per developer to a client so that the developers have time to accomplish all those other tasks that come up and meetings etc.  So it isn&#x27;t X/40, its really X/30, but it doesn&#x27;t even matter to us because we will never bill that way, but it is still the thing every client does in their head and I still wind up answering from time to time.<p>My only point about pricing then is to be careful putting numeric metrics near a price where it might make your price seem high, when in reality there are 100 other things that go into making that price.  Hopefully that makes sense.  Additionally, I see the starting at pricing usually lets people feel like they can negotiate and get a custom deal versus having to pay a fixed price and maybe not get what they truly want.",1436455974

My custom CMS has been in development for years; constantly improving it as I&#x27;ve grown as a programmer; it&#x27;s very easy to use and well documented. It costs X to implement and takes X hours to do so.&quot;<p>&quot;How do you want to proceed?&quot;<p>My custom is usually double the hours and double the fees - I explain everything; show past examples of both and let them decide.<p>If your not customizing a CMS to the customers needs (be it wordpress or your own home grown) your not providing a great product, IMO.",1436455654

Or, at least, the speed with which they can change their recommendations is sharply bounded by ensuring they never quite have to admit fault. Admitting you were wrong is basically begging to have your funding cut, your reputation trashed, your influence removed, your job cut. The closest thing a government can do to admitting being wrong is if they can say a <i>previous</i> government was wrong, but now we&#x27;re right. But for these administrative posts there&#x27;s never a clear turnover for that to occur.<p>Public policy adds the additional problem that if they admit they were wrong about what was possibly the single clearest message the government has sent the US public in the last 50 years, &quot;Fat is bad for you!&quot;, the public will very likely and entirely rationally start asking very pointy questions about how such <i>volume</i> could be combined with such error, and what else being communicated with such volume and confidence today may also be wrong.<p>The government has a ton of moral capital tied up in fat being bad for you, so it <i>has</i> to be bad for you. It <i>has</i> to be bad. <i>It just has to</i>.<p>As an individual, you may find it profitable to consider whether this is the sort of incentive structure that produces an authority you want to bet your life on. Considering whether there are similar issues where the government may have gotten stuck on a particular answer and now can not change its mind pretty much regardless of what facts come in left as an exercise for the reader.",1436455147

I feel like every time a major news publication publishes an op-ed or a study, they&#x27;re contradicting themselves[1]. One week eggs are bad, the next they&#x27;re good. Same with dairy, carbs, and red meat. Then you mix in the whole &quot;diet&quot; complexity: Atkins? Paleo? Keto? Vegan? How do I choose?<p>When you study the longest-living peoples of the world, you also find extremely varied diets: the carbohydrate-rich Greeks rely heavily on fruits, veggies and whole grains. They also love goat&#x27;s milk and wine. While natives of costa rica are primarily relying on &quot;evil&quot; white rice and beans, and heavy on pork and chicken. The people of Japan are also heavy on white rice, and virtually no fat in their diet, since their diet is primarily plant-based[2].<p>The truth is that everyone&#x27;s needs are different. As an anecdotal example, I was convinced that keto was the right way, and that carbohydrates were not going to help me. Did I lose fat? Yes. Did I feel great? Sure. It turns out that even with great HDL and Triglycerides, my LDL and fasting glucose were still high. And I&#x27;m not alone in this problem from keto either [3].<p>After switching to a broader, less-restrictive diet, which now includes whole grains (quinoa, oatmeal, and wild rice), beans, and fermented vegetables (kimchi, sauerkraut), lots of fruits and vegetables (including starchy carbs like sweet potatoes and squash), I&#x27;ve lowered my LDL and fasting glucose (yes, now that carbs are back in my diet). Different things work for different people because everyone has a different metabolism. It seems that, if you study the longest-living people, the trends are as follows:<p>* Don&#x27;t overeat.<p>* Eat mostly plant-based, whole or minimally-processed/refined foods.<p>* Leave 10-20% of your diet for indulgences. Virtually all of the longest-living peoples drink alcohol or coffee on the regular. And even then, by allowing yourself that affordance, you don&#x27;t risk binge eating or rebounding for days/weeks/months on end.<p>* Ignore fad diets. Stick with the whole foods that you like to eat, get in some variety, but don&#x27;t be dogmatic about dietary approaches, because not only will you likely not adhere to such restrictions, but you&#x27;ll probably find yourself being contradicted by another study in the next 3-10 years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/why-nutrition-is-so-confusing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/why-nutriti...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nsca.com/uploadedfiles/nsca/inactive_content/program_books/ptc_2013_program_book/aragon.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsca.com/uploadedfiles/nsca/inactive_content/prog...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?#safe=off&q=keto+fasting+glucose"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/webhp?#safe=off&q=keto+fasting+glucos...</a>",1436454778

The best practice for many reasons is to structure your app as lots of little components, and doing that in Angular is too hard, mostly because every component is at least three files, likely spread out in different places in the folder structure.

The problem is that when you're absymally poor, you don't have the resources to worry about how clean your wealth production is. Which is why they clearcut their forests without replanting and don't process their waste. And you can forget about things like recycling.<p>Here's an interesting fact that you rarely hear. Air and water quality in the US has been going up for the last 80 years. Right through all the industrialization and double digit increases in life expectancy and productivity. The reasons are simple - improved waste management, more efficient production, better recycling programs etc.",1190173126

I don't know who's saying Facebook is worth $6 billion, and I think it's overhyped too, but I'll bet Facebook is cashflow positive. Twitter's a joke? If it never becomes more than it is, then quite possibly. But perhaps its engineers plan for more than what it is today.

Ideally, the RSS feed would allow a link to the news.yc story, which would allow you to leave a comment. Modding should also be in the rss feed, if possible. Buttons are bad in most rss feeds it seems.",1184874348

Sometimes I see it, but not other times.<p>Leading users shouldn't be based on lifetime, as some people have dropped off. It should be something like mean karma/day over the last month. Both rankings would be useful.<p>I don't think an inbox is needed. Perhaps just an open comment stream on each users page, with the option of privacy. You then should be able to have an RSS feed from your user page.",1184873725

But you seem to work really hard for it...""<p>I never forgot that, and in the intervening years I've attributed the majority of my success to luck, rather than skill.  Luck, however, that I work hard to create.<p>The reason is this:  If you believe that your success is due to your own skill, you become lax.  Complacent.  Entitled.  You've succeeded so far, so clearly you're da man and you should succeed going forward.<p>If, on the other hand, you ascribe it to luck, you acknowledge that there's little that you did to make it work.  And so you have to keep working hard and scrambling to make the next project successful.  Because your previous successes have little bearing on future performance.\n",1184872231
35363,story,,,4,10,rob,"Can news.yc provide a 'comment' link in the RSS feeds?",,"I like how the feed titles go directly to the article in question and not to their own homepage first (like Digg), but I often find that I want to comment on a story I read here on news.yc. This means I have to open up news.ycombinator.com, find the article, and click 'comments'. Can you provide a simple '[comments]' link in the feed body pointing to the news.yc comment page, similar to reddit?",1184872119

Ashton RAN punk'd and built up a ton of PR and buzz for that show; I expect he'll help do the same for ooma.",1184871630

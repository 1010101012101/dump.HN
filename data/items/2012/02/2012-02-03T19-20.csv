It's very rare for founders to reject an acquisition offer and then later wish they'd taken it.<p>The difference between founders and investors is that founders care about more than just expected value.  A founder with no assets other than his stock in the company will often prefer to sell now and lock in the current price rather than keep rolling the dice.  So to the extent there is a difference between the motivations of founders and investors, it's exactly the opposite of the situation this writer describes.",1328299196

It looks like it works wonderfully well in a couple of particular cases but Node as every new language got its couple of pioneers running to create the new ""Rails/Django"" in that language asap. This is in my humble opinion the issue there.<p>Another issue is that Node is actually using Javascript, meaning it get a broader community than any new general language. But this community isn't by definition well familiarized with threading or async situations. These developers can easily slide into the ""silver bullet thing"".<p>Explaining the core notions behind event-based solutions and threading ones to a ""nodejs hipster"" usually allow him to understand the right uses cases for it, at least from my experience.",1328298856

Why does an offer for direct payment put such a damper on the party? As Margaret Clark, Judson Mills, and Alan Fiske suggested a long time ago, the answer is that we live simultaneously in two different worlds-one where social norms prevail, and the other where market norms make the rules. The social norms include the friendly requests that people make of one another. Could you help me move this couch? Could you help me change this tire? Social norms are wrapped up in our social nature and our need for community. They are usually warm and fuzzy. Instant paybacks are not required: you may help move your neighbors couch, but this doesnt mean he has to come right over and move yours. Its like opening a door for someone: it provides pleasure for both of you, and reciprocity is not immediately required.<p>> The second world, the one governed by market norms, is very different. Theres nothing warm and fuzzy about it. The exchanges are sharp- edged: wages, prices, rents, interest, and costs- and- benefits. Such market relationships are not necessarily evil or mean-in fact, they also include self- reliance, inventiveness, and individualism-but they do imply comparable benefits and prompt payments. When you are in the domain of market norms, you get what you pay for-thats just the way it is.",1328298657

Here's the argument being put forth:<p>Fructose in the diet must be metabolized by the liver, which creates excessive amounts of palmitic acid which induces fat to deposit in the liver which causes abnormal insulin response which leads to metabolic syndrome (an umbrella term including diabetes and obesity) which leads to poor personal health which means poor social health which means fructose is toxic.<p>The science available can support this: fructose in the diet is metabolized by the liver, which at some point of saturation (in animal studies, at outrageous levels of pure fructose intake) causes excessive creation of palmitic acid which is deposited into the liver as a fat. This liver fat is moderately to strongly implicated in abnormal insulin response which can progress to diabetes which is comorbid with obesity.<p>Thus, actual science is a long long long long way from ~Fructose is Toxic And Must Be Removed From The Foodstream~. There's also the problem of sucrose, which immediately decomposes into drumroll fructose and glucose.<p>Glucose in this story is beyond reproach - it is the foundation of animal life.

The primary reason for this was that we used Facebook data to show you where your friends lived, where they've been and allowed you to connect with them on gtrot (through Facebook) so there was no ""empty room"" feeling when you started.<p>With our latest updates in November, we allowed a 'generic view' --- a user can search what's happening in a city without logging in. We've put in educational messaging and explain why the Facebook connect is important to being able to personalize results. Based on what you like, what your friends like, where you've been, where they've been etc. The data is core to the experience, but some people still don't want to give access to Facebook. We did, however, see our bounce rate cut in half when we provided a generic view. Customers were spending more time on the site (upward of 5 minutes) and even returning to use the site without the account.<p>I think the key is giving clarity, but this is a topic we've gone back and forth on as we don't think we can deliver on our promise of 'personalized advice in any city' without having the Facebook basis.

My group presented on how Microsoft could better embrace open source, and during my part of the presentation I focused heavily on how many of Microsoft's ""OSS"" projects don't accept outside contributions.<p>I used VsVim to showcase how Microsoft was doing open source wrong. It was a great example, because Jared Parsons seemed to be doing everything he could to be a good OSS citizen and reach out to those who typically use an OSS stack (by putting his project on github instead of codeplex for example), but he had to turn down contributors outside of Microsoft as a matter of policy. I also didn't suspect that Microsoft would be repurposing a Vim emulator plugin written in F# for any of its closed source projects, so it didn't make sense to stop outsiders from contributing out of fear of losing complete ownership of the codebase.<p>Several high-level execs in STB including Satya Nadella were there, so I would like to believe that my presentation played some small part in Microsoft now allowing outside contributions to VsVim.

Honestly, can you go read what you wrote and justify anything you said?<p>""Thanks a lot for your comment, disagreement males you question your assumptions and strengthens your understanding of the issue.""  -  Why would you write this?  What is the point of writing this statement?  No really, pleeeeeeease, stop working on whatever you are doing, and for your own benefit. Put down Flow.  Put down your code.  Read this, and figure out really what you mean here.   Why would you respond with such a condescending sentence to someone who actually read what you said and wrote very really 'personal' arguments against it?<p>Is there a body of research that supports your counter-claims? I'd love to read anything you can point me to - Same trick again here, go ahead and read this line again, but there is a part 2 to this task. You now need to go read the commenters post.  I feel he makes it very very clear in his words and in his tone that all his objections are his just his own thoughts and opinions on the subject.  To be honest, I feel like an idiot explaining this to you, but I feel I need to because if I don't you may ask me if I have any 'evidence' to back up my claims.  Honestly, please go read that again and if you can justify why you said those words, please reply with them.  Please.<p>Finally, I'm sorry to say all this, and sorry to repeat some of the commeters criticism, but I was just so irritated reading this.  As naive and show offy as your blog post was, the kind of behavior shown in your response is 10000X as intolerable, and is just too common with people with that sense of false intellectualism in Silicon Valley.  The arrogance and condescension and just lack of respect youve shown creates dividers in people that don't need to exist, and really just decreases everyone's happiness.",1328297805

However the person doing the handing down was certain not buying a new lenovo. It performed ok, but never anything stellar.<p>It had a lot of weird quirks - it would suddenly flip it's CapsLock state, so i'd need to turn it on to shut it off. It would stay like that till I rebooted.<p>Eventually, the red button died... but it didn't just die, it forcibly dragged my mouse to the bottom of the screen. I had to fight with the thing to find the option to disable the button in the control panel before I could regain control of the computer. Plugging in an external mouse didn't help, the red button overrode all mouse commands.<p>Finally ,the thing all but gave out on me. I got a 2nd hand me down laptop, a Dell, before finally getting a real PC to work from.<p>That was my old job...<p>This current job, I have a T410, and I hate the thing. Everyone here has the same laptop (one guy has a slightly better model, but he hates his as well). They lock up, they have poor performance, they come with worthless bloatware, things fail for no reason... it goes on and on. Here are some examples:<p>Performance: It came with 4GBs of RAM. My old Dell had 4GBs, and I could keep 2-3 Visual Studios open at a time, no problem. This thing struggled to keep a single instance open. Keeping 2 open, damn near unusable. It would routinely take me 40-50 seconds to switch applications around (this is not an exaggeration. It would lock up and become unresponsive for a number of reasons, mainly switching between applications). For a developer, this is killer.<p>Sometimes while typing, the USB port my keyboard is attached to will die. Sometimes redocking fixes this. Sometimes I need to reboot.<p>Same thing for my bluetooth mouse. Sometimes I can pull the nub out and re-insert it and fix the problem, other times I have to reboot. Unlike the keyboard, the bluetooth nub stays with the laptop itself, so it isn't just that the dock has issues (Although it could... it was made by Lenovo)<p>Speaking of undocking, sometimes the screen goes dark, and never comes back. Other times, when I redock it, it's forgotten the video settings. Occasionally, it will only partially forget them, and turn on one of the 2 external monitors. I'd say I need to fix the monitor setup atleast 2-3 times per week.<p>Sometimes when it goes to sleep, it can't wake up.<p>When it isn't docked, and I'm using the built in screen, the color pallet gets off-kilter, and there is massive dithering over wide portions of the screen. Whole swaths of things get dithered, with green and red dots filling in the blanks. The severity of this seems to change day to day - sometimes it's fine, sometimes it's the entire screen, sometimes it's just a portion...<p>This isn't just my issue, mind you - Every single person in our team has these laptops, and experiences these issues.<p>ThinkPads used to be great, when IBM owned the brand.

It's not that public education is inherently bad - it can work beautifully and does right now in some parts of the world. But in the United States, at least, something isn't working. Private universities know that degrees are effectively mandatory so they're jacking up their fees, and many public universities are in states with budget issues. Additionally, standards are so low that I got in. I'm not that smart and I sure as hell wasn't good at being a student.<p>Depending on where you are, high schools are not graduating large fractions of their students and those who graduate are not always that successful. On the west side of Austin, a rich high school has a $2M jumbo-tron for their football field. On the east side of Austin, I once volunteered at a school with moldy textbooks. 7 mile difference.<p>There is a push toward private, micro-schooling. It's a natural progression of post-industrialization. We have free materials: Khan Academy, TED, millions of informative blog posts about everything, Wikipedia (needless to say), etc. I think that much is obvious. Why not just get study groups together with good books and free lectures and teach ourselves?<p>It's a great idea. The only problem I see is that many people who are interested in this are autodidacts, a group in which I include myself. It's not about being better or worse than other students, it's simply a learning style. The problem for many people, though, is that they need a kind of push in the classroom. There are a few startups working on education which focus on making lectures easy to share.<p>That's great, but interactive collaborative and meaningful projects - projects with depth and which require a thorough understanding of the material - are essential to igniting a students' curiosity. I would dare say that autodidacts are simply people good at coming up with their own projects. A truly good teacher is still necessary in the post-industrial education system I see forming but (at least for STEM) we need teachers who know the Moore method. We need teachers who assign the lectures for homework and can lead three different discussions in three different sections of the class, or who know the material well enough to pivot based on student needs. A good teacher will be just as effective when she is not speaking as when she is (perhaps moreso). Classrooms should be student run but framed by the teacher. That takes way more skill to get right than simply talking about problems in isolation.<p>I always rant about this subject. I guess my plea to education startups is this: help teachers share ideas and full curricula, help people train in the Moore method, and help create a parallel in-person presence to complement the impersonal digested presence of KA et al. Many bright people simply need socialization and tangible projects to form correct mental models. Skillshare seems to be a good start on this.",1328296830

3548404,comment,3547694,3548273,7,0,ctdonath,,,"1. As vishaldpatel notes, the pattern resembles meditative mantras. However the mind reacts to religious chanting, ""trance"" resembles that and invokes similar focus to the exclusion of other distractions. Indeed, we call the music ""trance"" for a reason.<p>2. The music does not demand attention to itself. Most other music is created with a ""drop what your doing and pay attention to ME"" sense, and we go to concerts and pay good money to listen to such music for what it is as the center of our attention at that time. Dance music derived from ambient origins creates a beautiful backdrop to something else, driving away other distractions and setting a pleasant environment for whatever we really want to do; most of it is created for, well, dancing - but the style where the focus is on self & moment, not on music or others & events.<p>In our culture, very little else combines to create this audio backdrop combining meditation and high energy. Most instruments demand the musician(s) focus on a full performance, and hence expect (hope?) the audience to give similar attention - the antithesis of what we're looking for here. Even ""minimalist"" acoustic[ish] music like Philip Glass & Steve Reich, which resembles ""trance"", requires an intense single-performance effort & focus of the performers, giving the implication to the audience that similar focus should return the favor.<p>Electronic music allows lots of free-running loops, zero-effort samples, edited-to-perfection sequences, and time-unconstrained editing after the fact - to wit, it's not created live, not intended for live performance, and the artist has no attitude of ""I'm not utterly focused on perfect end-to-end performance of this, so I don't expect utter focus of the audience"". Acoustic meditative music heads this way, but involves the performer in the focused activity; music isn't an ingrained part/consequence of coding.<p>Upshot: electronic music lends itself to creating coding-productive music. We'd like such music from other sources, but nothing else lends itself to producing such high-energy long-run content without demanding the listener's attention.",1328296287

3548361,comment,3542646,3542944,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"First: it's very difficult to grok copyright issues from a one-sided, non-legal presentation. Settled case law means going to trial and often going through multiple appeals.<p>Second: as it stands, this looks more to be a contractual than copyright matter (Elsevier is contractually banning use of automated text processing by subscribers), though it might possibly attempt to put teeth into this by asserting copyright. The remedy sought by Elsevier would be not to allege infringement, but to cancel future subscriptions.  It might be nice for, say, a large collection of institutions to call Elsevier's bluff.<p>Third: Copyright law as it exists (and particularly in the US where I understand it reasonably well) is <i>very</i> mechanical:  it governs the making of copies of an expressive work.  Copyright does NOT govern facts, it does not apply to works which are not expressive, it does not apply to works which are functional in nature.<p>The real test here would be to put this (and possibly other) <i>contract</i> claims to test in a court. Unfortunately, contracts are governed (in the US) under state, not federal law, and while there's some uniformity of language, it would probably take several such cases (and appeals to at least the Federal Circuit) to establish reasonable case law.<p>Otherwise, what's significant about this to me is that, once again, it's a case far less about the availability and copying of information (journal articles are routinely copied), than it is about power and control within an information market.  This is an area in which conventional economics is far too often lacking  (though it's also an area in which much interesting work is starting to  happen).",1328295716

It might be easy to add short sign-up and login forms to a site, but I doubt that implementing any external authentication mechanism would be really that much more work.
However, with password auth. the work doesn't end here. We typically need password reset/recovery and password change. The latter usually entails some kind of profile/settings page, while the former might require at least a dedicated login page.<p>In general, external authentication providers are good, as long as we don't limit ourselves to a single one. Adding Twitter / Google / BrowserID / Open ID / etc. is not that much more work, as the whole flow can be somewhat generalized. Having multiple authentication options also makes us prepared (from implementation PoV) for eventual support of user&pass auth., should we need it in the future.",1328295623

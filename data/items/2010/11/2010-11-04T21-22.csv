College contests are a gold mine.  Rather than pay a designer $1,000 to design your app post up flyers in the design department of your local college and offer a $300 prize for the best design.  It's a great way to save money and you can often tap into $5,000 worth of talent from the students.<p>2.  Don't use sites like scriptlance unless you're prepared to spec the project out very specifically.  NEVER, EVER use them to do something you can't do yourself.  In my experience sites for cheap labor will blow up in your face about 90% of the time so buyer beware (and if you do happen to find a quality person keep in contact with them outside the site)<p>3.  Advertising really doesn't work that well when you're trying to get off the ground.  There's just too much out there at this point.  It's better to spend your time and effort contacting influential people.  In my experience most people won't pay attention to advertising unless they've at least heard the name of the product through other means.<p>4.  I can't say enough good things about Amazon's Web Services.  If you have a lot of money there might be better options but for someone starting out with very little EC2 and S3 are great.<p>As for the programming itself the only advice I can offer is to do as much as you can by yourself.  $3,000 a month really isn't all that much in the long term so time is the only resource you have in abundance.  Most apps are relatively simple programming tasks that only get complicated when they have to scale.  So even with rudimentary skills you should be able to do 80% of the work yourself.<p>Don't assume you have the skills now but the few hundred you spend on javascript and usability books could save you thousands if you put the effort into it.",1288907994

The reason you should do the brew your own route is that you don't add in any preservatives that many of the main wine manufacturing companies do and it is also about 1/3 to 1/4 the price.<p>As for drinking too much, sure man I drink more than one serving about 3-4 times a week, some weeks it is 0 some weeks it is 7, especially when I'm in a town where I have lots of old friends or family. It does take effort to make sure to do so responsibly and to take breaks. For example, I do 40 days once a year with absolutely 0 intake, even down to ordering a nonalcoholic becks at a after work meeting. I go up to the bartender and tell him discretely that when I order a becks to make sure it is in a glass, but to simply give me a non-alcoholic one. I've never been to a bar that didn't have some, so it must be pretty common. The reason I take a long break is to stop the slow evolution from 4 days a week to 4.2 to 4.4, etc. The reason that I'm careful is that my genius grandparent (8 languages, 4 engineering degrees + a masters, 3rd most powerful position in a medium world power, 10 instruments, etc) had to totally quit after he developed a problem and...<p><i>I like drinking</i>, so I'm willing to be responsible about it and make sure to try to do red wine as often as possible and appropriate. I think that there are a lot of people like the OP reading this that are in the exact same position. They drink slightly more than what has been blessed as kosher by society and are afraid to come out and admit it because they don't want to be lumped in with actual holy-fuck-I-have-a-problem drunks.

1870926,comment,1869046,1869046,0,0,AnonResponse,,,"My father was a high-functioning alcoholic when I was growing up. I didn't even find out about it until I was 20 or so. He just used booze, like you do, to take the edge off after a stressful day at work. He wasn't loud or belligerent or even noticeably drunk or anything like that.<p>Nonetheless, it had an impact on him, and his family and relationships, and it impacted me in ways that still have consequences to this day. He has difficulty forming relationships, and he has difficulties communicating even in the relationships that he has. He is not in touch with his feelings, which sounds like hippy-dippy bullshit, but it's a serious problem because those emotions are still there, unaddressed, and they affected his emotional health and his ability to be happy. And, as a result of growing up in a household that doesn't communicate well, and having a male role model who buries his emtions, I have difficulties communicating and forming relationships, and I tend not to deal with my emotions in a healthy manner. I've participated in recovery groups for adult children of alcoholics, and this is apparently what that program is designed to deal with, because that's what we all have--issues with personal communication, buried emotions.<p>My father lost his marriage, and I had a depressive breakdown in college. We also don't talk more than once every few months. He's dealt with his alcoholism by now, and he's sober and in recovery programs, and he's making progress in all those habits and patterns that normal healthy people have that he didn't. But that doesn't bring his marriage back, and that doesn't bring his relationship with his son (me) back.<p>So, my point is, just because you don't hurt people or say stupid shit and light your pants on fire when you're drunk, don't think that there aren't consequences. The stereotype of the drunk husband/father is the one who comes home and shoutsat /beats his wife and/or kids. However, you can be the polar opposite of that, and still have your relationship destroyed by your alcoholism. When you deal with your stress with beer, instead of using the support of your loving family, you're making emotional isolation a part of your family life. You're mentally checking-out (that's the point, right?), during the part of the day when you're supposed to be together, developing & strengthening your relationships. Don't think you can compensate for this by being overly affectionate. It doesn't work like that. Love isn't about displays. It's about personal interactions, living together and helping each other.<p>Speaking for myself, I've made progress in conquering my baggage because I have a wonderful supportive girlfriend who makes me be communicative and emotive. So, my advice which I'm pulling out of my ass as a random dude on the internet: take away the need to drink, and simultaneously work on rolling back the problems it may have caused, by talking to your wife about when you're stressed about work/life/etc instead of opening up a beer. It will take a long time and a lot of work on your part to make it work. Stay with it.",1288906955

Should I focus on wrapping up SICP or should I focus on designing a rough product, putting it on the web, and selling it?<p>Long version:
I am currently working as a mechanical engineer and am sometimes doing coding projects for work, and often doing small coding projects part-time. The coding projects I have worked on are mainly things I worked on while on company time for specific projects, and thus I do not believe I own the rights to them.<p>I would love to launch a project with the potential to sell it online.<p>My coding background:<p>I coded for the first time when I was less than 10 years old, and this mainly consisted of BASIC code.  In my teens, I made a website with html that I hand-coded (frames and all) for a game that I was playing at the time.  The only programming course that I took while in college was c++.  I have been using Matlab/Octave on a continual basis since entering college about 8 years ago.<p>More specifically, I have created the following:
In Java - I was in a PhD program and I worked on some Finite Element Analysis code that my professor created in Java.  Before I dropped the program, I had added a module for a specific, relatively complicated composite element.<p>In C++ - I created a mechanical linkage simulator that would compute mechanical advantages, stresses, and deflections given design parameters (mainly geometry).  More recently, I created a program to determine a system response to a power spectral density.  (Basically, I have a mechanical structure and I shake it with a simulated rocket launch to determine the accelerations that the system responds at)<p>In Python - I ported the mechanical linkage simulator to Python because it was much easier to make a simple GUI in Python.  I then modified the program enough to animate the opening/closing motion and to change geometry. (it was a simple outline and line drawing of the linkage)<p>In Octave - Most recently, I created a program that simulates combustion, gas flow, and heat transfer in a tightly coupled system that could really help my current employer.<p>In Scheme - No projects other than those problems in SICP.<p>Most of my projects have been text-based because I have been one of the only users of the program, except for that ported program in Python.  I'm somewhat worried about making the most recent simulation program into an outside-of-work project of mine (generalizing it, giving it a real GUI and some graphics) due to intellectual property issues.  I have come up with a few ideas not related to my work aside from this, but I'm concerned about the small potential market of specialised engineering programs.<p>As for what has distracted me from SICP, I decided to set up an old desktop I had laying around as an Ubuntu server, putting LAMP on it, and starting to work through another book on the basics of web design.  I have also figured out a way to not only SSH into my server from my cellphone, but also access Emacs and I've written a few hello world programs in Scheme/C++ using my phone and ran or compiled them remotely in the same manner.<p>I've started to re-evaluate my focus and desires due to reading ""Creating"" by Robert Fritz, and I suppose that I don't have a specific path to go down.  I wouldn't mind working on a project that has potential (either an idea I conjure up or someone else's) part time, but my current job is in a relatively remote/non-tech region.  It's been somewhat difficult for me to get over the clean slate in front of me to create something on my own unrelated to work, even though I know that I have the capability to create just about any tool I would use at work, given enough time.<p>Any advice would be appreciated.",1288905706

More often than not, these sites have easily identifiable spots for improvement. Page layout, search functionality, mapping...the usuals. About as common is for these sites to also be cookie-cutter sites that are either webservice or some PHP (or whatever) package that they run themselves on a webhost.<p>This state of commodity makes it easy to design an entire site pretty much instantly that would be an order of magnitude easier to use, because eliminating any one frustration with using a commodity and you can take entire swaths of the marketplace. In travel it's going to be <i>all about</i> conversion, so anything that cuts down find-and-pay time is user-friendly. I don't know how attached the inventory (destination providers, cabin landlords, etc.) gets to these sites or if they'll sign up for anything that can be explained as an improvement over the status quo, but that's easy enough to research: the next time your interest in travel takes you to a travel agent, all you have to do is wait for them to say, ""Gonna take a sec, the web thingy is slow,"" and the conversation can flow from there. ""Is it better than what you used before that?""<p>Furthermore, I'd bet people at (e.g.) FlyerTalk are likely to describe their frustrations with site providers in some detail, which would be another ""real person"" vector: go to where the customers are. If you can find people who pay money to others despite having to do it via a flawed (to the customer) solution, you might be able to find out what would constitute an improvement in <i>the market's</i> eyes. The company/agent/provider (inventory) side of this equation is always going to be relatively dumb.<p>I guess I should have a second-best advice, too: Let people tell you. They will, if you're listening. Try to speak their language rather than hunting for people who can speak yours (""it's often quite hard for them to point out inefficiencies"").<p>So anyway, as someone who gets ideas all the time, that's a little time-lapse snapshot of my thought process when loosed upon a hypothetical.",1288905119

1870793,comment,1869046,1870488,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"The full answer will not fit in this margin, but I'll give it a rough go. And I hope you'll forgive the delay -- my condition makes both typing and coherent language more difficult than I'd like.<p>When people come into any twelve step program (AA is the senoir sibling in a large family), the first thing that happens is what the Oxford Group called ""deflation"". Stated simply, it's an acknowledgement that whatever it is you've been doing to solve the problem isn't working, and that your next big brainstorm is unlikely to be any more successful than the last couple hundred approaches. In HackerSpeak, you are a Blub programmer trying to write elegant Lisp in Brainfuck, and nothing you are likely to do will result in anything other than smoke and shredded paper erupting violently from your virtual Turing machine. In the twelve step world, the wording is ""we admitted we were powerless over $interfering_agent, that our lives had become unmanageable."" There are dozens of helpful slogans along the lines of ""let go and let God"", and the Serenity Prayer (""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference."") of which nobody seems to remember more than the first clause. A lot is made of the concepts of powerlessness, surrender and acceptance, and in the early going these concepts are paramount to success.<p>Unfortunately for too many people, there is a tendency to become stuck in that mode. The first step is clearly written in the past tense, and the Big Book (the Scripture for those so inclined) promises that we will find the power we need to win the battle with the substance and ourselves. The problem is that the learned helplessness, something that was only meant as a means to relax and trust the process, becomes permanent. The Point (with an intentional capital ""P"") is that we are not God, that this universe wasn't created for our individual pleasure, that it won't bend itself to suit our will and, to paraphrase Marcus Aurelius, things will work out pretty much the way they're supposed to if we stop trying to play with all of the knobs and dials on the machine. Many turn to a god, or a similar concept, and deem that their ""higher power"", and having something omnipotent that you can almost imagine to trust in when times are darkest can be extremely comforting. Staying in that mode for too long, though, leads people to pray for results that they should be working towards. I have no particular quarrel with prayer as such -- I'm an atheist, but not from the Orthodox sect of atheists -- but every worthwhile prayer I've ever seen in any religion has as its petition, ""give me the courage and strength to do the things I need to do."" Powerless people who will never be able to manage their own lives pray for divine intervention to produce results for them.<p>The value of life is in participation. I have been in far too many church basements and community centre attics over the years filled with people who ""do the readings"", pray and meditate until the cows come home, and rarely have more than this to say when they share: ""I've been sober for more than twenty years now, and it seems that every day is a little worse than the one before. I have to learn to 'turn it over' completely, and let God do for me the things I can't do for myself."" Far be it from me to stand between a person and his voluntary exile into misery, but I do my best to stop the spread of the dysphoria.<p>I'm rarely anybody's first sponsor -- I guess I seem too far removed from the problem for people to believe that I've ever been where they are. I have been the second or third sponsor to a whole lot of people, though, and unlearning that helplessness is Job One. To an addict or alcoholic, sobriety is a whole new chance at life, and if all you're getting out of sobriety is sobriety, you are cheating yourself horribly. We all tried sobriety at points along the way before trying the program, and it was a miserable enough experience that we eventually went back to self-medication. Real recovery is in discovering who you are, accepting that person in lieu of the persona you were hoping to wear, and living the hell out of the life that person was supposed to have.<p>Where was I? Oh, yeah -- my job has been to tell people that they have permission to act. To be unapologetically themselves. To try again tomorrow if they fail today. To understand that they will never achieve the ideals they've set for themselves -- they are merely human, after all -- but knowing that does not mean that striving for those ideals is futile. (And if you're hearing a build-up to a familiar song from <i>The Man of La Mancha</i> in the back of your mind, you're following me exactly.) That's the gist of it. That's who I discovered I am, and what I discovered I was meant to be doing now that everything else is slowly slipping away from my grip. It keeps me alive in more than a metabolic sense -- there ain't nothin' like watching cold, dead eyes begin to sparkle with life to dry a dampened spirit.",1288905038

In fact, in the overwhelming majority of cases not involving chemicals or pharmaceuticals, the people being sued (and thus punished) are independent inventors.  It's hard for me not to conceive of ""people getting sued over things they invented/created completely independently"" as anything other than a pure cost to society, and the research in this paper makes it pretty clear that most patent lawsuits fall into that category of ""pure cost to society.""<p>It also does say something about the ""benefits"" of the patent system, though less strongly:  clearly if the vast majority of people being sued in particular industries are independently inventing things, that means that the knowledge transfer benefits of patents in those industries is likely over-stated by pro-patent lobbies.",1288904937

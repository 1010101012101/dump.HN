(that is their primary focus, i think.) but, i can't imagine a great deal of young people using this (or any other web application for dating).<p>the web is simply not a great medium for this sort of human interaction. there is a lot of crucial physical, chemical and social data that is not communicated through pictures and fragments of text. further, what information is communicated is unreliable. clearly the picture selection will not be without bias and the text is highly premeditated, which confuses the sexual selection for verbal acuity and mental quickness.  there isn't enough bandwidth if you will.<p>i think this is only useful for sex addicts and predatory men (and who wants to compete with craigslist?). clearly everyone involved would be better off just going outside.<p>although i suspect (some) girls may use this, but only for their egos. this may even skew the female participation towards the more attractive. this would of course attract men who want to 'interact' with them. but, i don't see these attractive young girls actually following through however. so i think the system would be fraudulent and unsustainable. <p>but that doesn't mean there isn't money to be made.",1189295935

(which isn't to say that there's not zealotry involved, just that I don't think that's the only thing driving the RP stories)<p>It could also be argued that your comment was completely off topic for the link, kind of like the guy who always complains about the xkcd links on reddit. Would you argue that xkcd is driven by zealotry, or are there just a lot of reddit users who who actually like seeing xkcd? (and again, I'm one of the people who occasionally upvotes the xkcd comics)<p>",1189295892

52328,comment,52251,52322,0,0,michaelneale,,,"My take on switching to News.YC is that as there is no down vote, its not an ""agreement"" vote for me, its more that its just want I want to read. Because there is no down (unless its hidden?) my up has more value, I am more careful what I give it to then on reddit. Probably upvote half as much. ",1189295565
52327,comment,52251,52322,0,0,Alex3917,,,"In theory it seems like del.icio.us should have much better content for this reason. But in practice making the front page of Reddit is good for 5-10k pageviews, whereas making the front page of del.icio.us is good for 1,000 at most. This raises the question as to whether the zealotry actually helps make Reddit more popular, or whether the low traffic of del.icio.us is due to bad design or some other factor.",1189295315

52323,comment,52251,52251,0,0,nickb,,,"Maybe Ron Paul proliferation is due to the man's ideas and his honesty?! And his popularity on reddit and other sites is due to the fact that he resonates well with what people think? Maybe people are sick of candidates that lie to you all the time. You know... just stating the obvious.",1189294296
52322,comment,52251,52320,0,0,pg,,,"It seems to be a different kind of upvoting. When I write something new it generally shows up on both reddit and del.icio.us/popular.  Stuff about Ron Paul only shows up on reddit.  What that implies is that people are upvoting it because they want <i>other</i> people to read it, rather than because they found it interesting themselves.<p>The reddit guys actually worried about this problem from the very beginning.  That was why initially there was such an emphasis on voting as a way of training filters: if you voted for dumb stuff, you'd be punished by having to read dumb stuff. But the filter-training message never got through, perhaps because the filtering worked so badly for so long.",1189293713

52319,comment,52251,52251,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"I don't think too much should be read into the recent activity on Reddit. Ron Paul has actively promoted his campaign on the internet and has been a large proponent of internet freedoms. So users' behaviour on reddit probably isn't representative of the average American but actually quite representative of the average Internet user. In other words reddit's ranking system hasn't been abused in this sense.",1189293154

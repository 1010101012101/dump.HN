7338560,comment,7338221,7338514,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"The ethics of the power players in Silicon Valley are far worse than those on Wall Street. (I don&#x27;t know dick about Hollywood other than its reputation.)<p>Wall Streeters are greedy, but they don&#x27;t go out of their way to ruin peoples&#x27; careers (except in the movies). They&#x27;ll do a lot of things to get that $10 million bonus, but they don&#x27;t hold long-term grudges and wreck careers of people who&#x27;ve since flown away from them. A trader will get you fired if it suits his career goals, because he is ruthless, but once you&#x27;re out of his way, he&#x27;ll take an active interest in making sure you get a better job afterward. Valley people, when they separate, tend to make it really ugly: lots of gossip, negative references, long-term grudges and other nonsense that wouldn&#x27;t exist among people who cared more about themselves winning than about other people losing.<p>Silicon Valley attracts people who want power, and those tend to be worse than those who want money. It also attracts, more than nerds, people who come on <i>specifically to take advantage of nerds</i>. The latter set tend to be horrible, and to rise fast.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the false poverty effect. If you make $10 million in a year, you&#x27;re rich. If you&#x27;re a trust-fund kid, but you&#x27;re only paying yourself a $25,000 salary because that&#x27;s all your investors will let you take out, you feel more entitled to fuck people over because you&#x27;re &quot;the little guy&quot; and because, being &quot;scrappy&quot; (or &quot;lean&quot;), you &quot;can&#x27;t afford&quot; the costs of being ethical.",1393909051

Since this cost greatly exceeds the sticker price of windows, or Mac for that matter, it is the real reason why people tend to stick with the OS they already know how to use.<p>It&#x27;s one of the reasons why Linux never got much traction on the desktop. Sure it made a great desktop OS for the technorati but Joe Public knows how to do what he wants in Windows, and saving $50 isnt incentive enough for him to change.<p>As you say, &quot;free is not enough&quot;.<p>Incidentally the exact same thing plays out with regard to apps. Office may have strong Open Source competition, but free is not enough there either to get most people to switch.<p>This effect is not limited to the OS itself, but extends to the flavor of the OS as well. Despite what the popular press says, windows 8 is not bad, but it is different. Vista was better than you think, but wasa different to XP and so on. Xp was the gold standard for a long time, so it&#x27;s easy to forget how much people resisted it at first.<p>And before you get too smug, look at the division in the Linux market right now over Unity.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing. The price of the OS is irrelevant. Free is not an advantage. Windows will exist on the desktop for many years to come, and will likely flop on the phone. But price will have nothing to do with either outcome.",1393908831

So it will recognize the &quot;untracked files&quot; to borrow some git terminology. That is for adding files. As far as removing, moving, modifying files (i am assuming you mean metadata?) goes take a look at the move/remove/update beet commands.<p>What follows is a slightly rambly not well edited description of my importing. I apologize for the length/grammar.<p>I think I was in a similar situation as you. I started with 5 or 6 big collections of music that had diverged over the years; flac/shn bootlegs, old itunes installations, xmms libraries, etc and a couple of small collections from netbooks:<p><pre><code>  /music/itunes\n  /music/olditunes\n  /music/olditunes-ibookg3\n  /music/current\n  /music/blah\n  ...\n\n\n</code></pre>\nBefore touching beets I ran rdfind over the itunes directories and then over the non itunes directories. rdfind leaves the copy in the directory listed earliest so I listed the directories in order of most recently used. This essentially wiped out the oldest directory from the itunes and non-itunes sets. I then ran rdfind against all of the directories (once again in order of most recently used). The amount of space I saved  was insane.<p>Once I had manually cleaned up the low hanging duplicate fruit I did the two step import. I got hit with the CD1/CD2 quirk the first time I did the two step import. Because I had the backup directory I just blew away the beet library and started over. This time before I ran the quiet import I tried to do a best effort of consolidating the cd1/2 albums. `tree` came in handy for finding the problem albums:<p><pre><code>  $ tree -i -f -d --prune /music |grep -i &quot;cd1\\|disc1\\|cd\\ 1\\|disc\\ 1&quot;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI did the `mv cd1/* cd2/` by hand. It did not take as long as I thought it would. I gave it my best effort and reran the quiet import. This solved a ton of the problems. Before doing the interactive import I sorted /music with<p><pre><code>  $ du --max-depth=3 -h /music |sort -h \n</code></pre>\nBecause I used the move import instead of copying it was easy to see if there were any recurring problems. The only things that are left are the things beets could not ID by itself.  My biggest import hiccup was concerts from archive.org&#x27;s etree archive. I still have to move them in.  I am still deciding how I want to handle the one hit wonder songs. Right now my config has the following for paths:<p><pre><code>  paths:\n      default: $albumartist/$album%aunique{}/$track $title\n      singleton: 0xSingles/$genre/$artist/$title\n      comp: 0xCompilations/$genre/$album%aunique{}/$track $title\n</code></pre>\nThe singleton and compilation defaults are:<p><pre><code>    singleton: Non-Album/$artist/$title\n    comp: Compilations/$album%aunique{}/$track $title\n</code></pre>\nThis was going to mean my non-album and compilation album directories had hundreds of directories.<p>Feel free to followup with any more questions.",1393907312

I actually just bounced it off one of my users and they thought it would be great, but I often get flattering responses when I ask my users if they would like X because they already like us for solving a real pain.",1393905775

If people don&#x27;t want so many cars and want something else, some entrepreneur can borrow money, hire people and provide it.  Borrowing to make money is good, borrowing for consumption is bad.  We&#x27;ve been relying too much on the latter, as a nation.",1393905735

But Google is running a platform. In the past I&#x27;ve compared it to an information marketplace. And the goal for Google is to make the market run as efficiently as possible, otherwise they risk losing one side.<p>Searchers don&#x27;t pay Google, but they do (presumably) pay Google&#x27;s advertisers, who pay Google. If you lose the searchers, you lose the advertisers.<p>Now of course there is a balancing act, which you allude to in your last paragraph. But there are plenty of easy examples where Google returns no ads even though they could. A search for &quot;how old is barack obama&quot; just returns the number (or Wikipedia), without ads, even though I&#x27;m sure there are advertisers out there who would pay for an ad to be shown.<p>So obviously it&#x27;s not universally true that &quot;the best search results Google can produce are those which maximize their revenue.&quot; Perhaps adding some subtlety to your argument would help me understand exactly what you&#x27;re saying.",1393905610

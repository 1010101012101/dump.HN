347185,comment,347059,347059,0,0,DenisM,,,"That was pretty good.<p>One trick I use to substract my own bias is to pretend that I am on the other side. If I hold some stock I am naturally more likely to defend it to my friends. Then I pretend that I shorted that stock and start defending the opposite position. Then I look which position is more idiotic. :)<p>Sometimes it even works, although I didn't get it work reliably.",1225259705
347184,comment,347022,347022,0,0,gamble,,,"I've long felt that Blu-ray is destined to be a niche videophile product. I'm happy to buy them, but I've got a high-end HDTV and sound system. Even then, most titles aren't dramatically higher quality than upsampled DVDs on my Oppo. Most people, on an average home theater, would have a hard time noticing the difference. With today's economy and the ubiquity of DVD players, it's difficult to imagine that there are many more people willing to buy a new player and pay 50% more for media. I suspect Christmas sales will be very disappointing for Sony.",1225259459

347170,comment,347137,347137,0,0,pedalpete,,,"Though I like your Opera angle, particularly with Opera's strength in mobile. 
Not that i disagree with the rest of your ideas, but they just don't seem to really shout 'strategy', and I gotta say I don't really understand your 'Partner with IBM' plan.<p>I suspect Flickr's strength is specifically that it isn't monetized like SmugMug. They don't need to copy another service, they need to innovate and continue the growth of that platform. Though that may mean stronger monetization of the business, I hope it would not mean simply copying another service.<p>With respect to 'Owning the Living Room', I suspect that this is so far from there strengths as to be unrealistic with the economics currently the way they are. Sure you could argue the same about Google, but they've got the cash to go out and make a mobile OS and give it a go. Yahoo! arguably can't take that risk on a market which is not as large as mobile.<p>Just my thoughts, but I think the Opera angle is a pretty good one.",1225258290

It probably varies by location.<p>I reported a crime about 2 years ago, and they needed my signature on an official statement.  The department left a message that said ""When you're home next, call back 555-1212 extension 9999, or just call 911 and ask for detective so-and-so"".  I figured, when am I going to get to call 911 again?  So I called, stated that I had no emergency, but was told I could get in touch with detective so-and-so, and they transferred me to him and were even really nice about it.",1225258285
347168,comment,346130,346668,0,0,netcan,,,"Good question. But then, Google is about as dominant as we can expect anyone to be long term.<p>For the foreseeable future search is worth a lot. So for the foreseeable future, helping search increase market share (even if it's only by 0.X%) is worth a good bit too.<p>Actually, from a simplistic viewpoint, the ff search deal is worth more to MS then it is to Google. If FF didin't strike that deal, what engine would they put there? The cost of putting up MS/Yahoo in terms of user experience & pundit complaints would be something compared to Google.<p>Also, Google would probably end up with a lot of that search traffic anyway. MS wouldn't have. Google is in a snese paying for traffic they may have gotten anyway. MS would be paying for nee traffic.",1225258261

347164,comment,347137,347137,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I don't think Flickr is big enough to make much impact on their bottom line. Even if they doubled revenues, it'd still be a drop in the bucket.<p>Netflix has its own troubles, but might be a good buy for them. Way outside of their core competency, but moving toward it at least. They're probably still wary of trying to become a media company since that's what drove them to where they are now. They bought one V.O.D. company, and the only people who benefited from that were  Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner.<p>Not sure what exactly you want them to do with IBM. Any suggestions as to how they could partner? I don't see much synergy there.<p>Why would Nintendo let someone else deliver flash games on their platform? Nintendo most certainly doesn't need anyone's help there. If they decide to go that route, they'll run it themselves. I expect them to do some Xbox Live Arcade type stuff at some point.<p>Yahoo's current strategy of opening up might actually be good and is much more in line with their core competencies. Branching off into goofy tangential media stuff (as a result of hiring a Hollywood CEO) is what got them into this pickle.",1225258004
347163,comment,347145,347161,0,0,jacobscott,,,"Sorry, the key point is that the assertion:<p>""Therefore, P is not equal to NP, is true and provable in a simply consistent extension B"" of B""<p>does not necessarily imply P \neq NP (the caveat being the B"" and B stuff).

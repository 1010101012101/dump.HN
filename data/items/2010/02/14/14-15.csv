If I have something and I haven't used it in 90 days, I probably don't need it and get rid of it (sell it, give it away, throw it out).  This tends to keep my life de-cluttered and ""focused"".  It also keeps me from waisting money on stuff I don't need.  ""Am I really going to be still excited about, and benefit from, using this widget I want to buy in 90 days or not?""  I've lived like this for about a decade and I highly recommend trying it.<p>There are exceptions of course.  Seasonal items like clothing, mountain bike, etc...  Books too as mentioned in the essay.

And the idea of OO (and good programming in general) is to avoid that.<p>You keep talking about ""ignore Java's syntax and focus on being a better programmer"", but I think if you use fields for your public interface, you are compromising the quality of your code.

1124653,comment,1124405,1124627,0,0,jrockway,,,"No programming language will solve the problem of bad programmers.   If you can edit the code, private methods provide no protection -- the programmer that wants to get at that functionality will just change it to public and recompile, or worse, cut-n-paste the code into his own module.  The enforced privacy, therefore, adds no safety.  Not enforcing privacy at least allows you to write a subclass that carefully changes the behavior of the original, at the risk of coupling the subclass to the superclass (but this is better than cut-n-pasting).<p>In an ideal world, you could rewrite every library that was designed incorrectly, but there is not always time for this.  Intentionally limiting flexibility (""private"") is worse for code reuse than allowing someone to intentionally change internal details.  (Which is what privacy prevents.)<p>A good programmer will use his judgment to determine whether to cut-n-paste, subclass, or rewrite.  The programming language should not remove options from his toolbox.<p><i>Now I work for a big tech company, and I'm in charge of a framework again except now its JavaScript which has the same problems when people force this classical inheritance pattern and now when some guy doesn't get it he's in another building or another country and did so in a repository I didn't even know existed and his code that breaks my encapsulation is in a production device and when I refactor my code I have the possibility that I break live code on some project or some device I don't know about.</i><p>Well, the tests stop passing.  The tests are what ensure your code works, not ""private"" directives.  ""private"" is just documentation that suggests ""you probably don't want to call this directly"".  ""Probably.""<p>All I can say is that technical solutions to social problems never work.  Rewrite your app in Haskell and I guarantee that dumbass developers will still be able to mess up your code.

1124627,comment,1124405,1124592,0,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"Why are private methods good for documentation? They shouldn't even be documented save for inline comments. The whole idea of privacy in my mind is that the only person or people who should know that these functions even exist are those who maintain the class/library/framework. This helps immensely because when you want to refactor you know EXACTLY which method signatures or attributes have to be supported for backward compatibility. You can really keep on top of things, and as long as you took the time to create a flexible API, you can handle change gracefully. I don't even unit test my private methods because I don't even care about them or what they do. I only care that some data is passed to a public API and returns the correct result. They are there, as you say, purely as a means to organise my code.<p>For example, in my last company I wrote this ORM in Moose. I released it. And the guys I was working with just didn't get the concept of Moose. They kept accessing the attributes from the underlying blessed hash like they did before rather than the accessors. It still worked because internally Moose stores stuff the way Conway recommended in OOP Perl (which was a weird decision imho). One day I renamed one of my database columns and so had to rename my accessor and created a manual function that warned of ""obselete call to accessor x"" whilst returning the new column name... backwards compatibility, yay! But they didn't see this because they didn't use the accessor and now all their manual hash accessing was returning undefined or null or whatever it is.<p>Of course it only took me going over to their table and explaining to them how Moose worked or getting together for a meeting. Fine. But that was a company with a technical team of around 10 people. Now I work for a big tech company, and I'm in charge of a framework again except now its JavaScript which has the same problems when people force this classical inheritance pattern and now when some guy doesn't get it he's in another building or another country and did so in a repository I didn't even know existed and his code that breaks my encapsulation is in a production device and when I refactor my code I have the possibility that I break live code on some project or some device I don't know about.<p>So yeah, privacy is an important concept and if you don't think so I would say it is you who lives in a superficial bubble where everyone who uses your API or works on your code can be trusted to have good sense.",1266157957

It works surprisingly well.<p>I've been thinning out my media stuff (books, videos, old records, etc.) in batches during moves, but recently began selling what I could on amazon. It's mostly CDs and books, but in the past two months it's totaled about $800. One problem, however, is many titles are worth too little for me to go through the trouble of listing, selling, packing, and shipping them. This is especially true of older books. No matter how good or important they were, about 90% sell for <$2 used on Amazon.",1266156418

There is no high-level concept of ""attribute"" in Java, which is what programmers actually want.<p>In Perl, you say ""has foo => ( init_arg => 'foo', isa => Whatever, reader => 'get_foo', writer => 'set_foo' )"" and the correct code is generated.  In Java, there is no concept of ""attribute"", so you have to build it every time by manually declaring the field, manually writing the constructor, and manually writing the getters and setters.  Anything you do manually more than once has the potential to introduce a subtle bug, and more importantly, is tedious and degrading.",1266156227

I'm not sure how Perl's OO is a ""hack"", in my opinion, people that say this only have a superficial understanding of what object-oriented programming is.  It's a way to organize code, it's not a way to prevent people from calling methods.  Perl's OO is superset of Java's OO.  Hack or not, it encourages reuse and modularity, and makes this very easy for the programmer to get right.<p>""private"" is one of the worst programming language concepts ever invented.  Perl's lack of this bug is a feature.  Private methods are nice for documentation purposes, but most developers misuse ""protected"" and ""private"", and it makes their libraries nearly impossible to use.  In a perfect world; great idea.  In the real world; a huge waste of time.",1266156020

I would also argue that it's not just limited to software patents in particular, but it's become common practice for many companies to create patents for anything they can imagine. This has resulted in a deluge of patents that have to be sorted out by the USPTO, and therefore a lot of bad, should-be-invalid patents get okayed.<p>Here's a perfect example of a bad patent screwing a company out of a product they've been making for years: <a href=""http://luma-labs.com/blogs/news/4540122-an-open-letter-to-our-customers-past-and-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luma-labs.com/blogs/news/4540122-an-open-letter-to-ou...</a><p>(Summary: Competitor gets an illegitimate patent approved, and now a company that has been ""infringing"" on that patent since before they applied to get it has to stop making their product. Why? Because litigation will likely put them out of business, even if they win.)<p>I'm not against the idea of patents, but the direction they've been going in recently, in fact the direction our entire economy has been going in recently, has been that of favoring those with the money to blow on hordes of lawyers capable of interpreting and navigating the legal minefield they themselves have lobbied to create.",1353477599

4813012,comment,4812589,4812840,5,0,weisser,,,"Taskrabbit can be hit or miss.  I signed up as a taskrabbit purely because I was curious about the interface they were using for bidding on and being assigned tasks.  I completed two tasks in the span of three days.<p>The first was a pick up/drop off job that consisted of me picking up some rental items and dropping them off about 30 minutes outside Boston ($25).  The second was ordering an iced latte at Starbucks and literally delivering it a block away ($14!). Both times the mobile app failed (iPhone 4S, iOS 6) in two different ways.  For the first task it failed multiple times when I tried to mark the task as complete-not such a big deal since the task was done.  The fail during the second task was critical-it would not let me login to view where the drop-off location was and the email confirmation confusingly showed the start and end location as the same address (Starbucks). I had to call the person who submitted the task to verify drop-off location and explain that the app had failed.  They weren't irritated but I could see why me calling might be disruptive since they made this task to avoid leaving the building and walking a block.<p>Those sort of really simple (meaning ~2 steps) tasks seem to be few and far between.  Many tasks such as, ""Go shopping for me at IKEA,"" turn out to be much more involved when you read the details and find out the task includes assembling the furniture on-site.<p>For me it was more about trying out the interface on really basic tasks than making money but perhaps more complicated tasks would be something you'd be willing to do.  Another important note is that the taskrabbit application is not too quick of a turnaround.  I think it took nearly two weeks before I was approved.",1353476830

4813010,comment,4811922,4812825,17,0,intenex,,,"Wow, I'm with chernevik on this one. Both perspectives were great to be brought up, but frankly, what's the difference with <i>most Americans</i> being worse off than this person and most of the people in the world being worse off? You are in fact saying the same thing - this guy has less right than he feels to be so sorry for himself.<p>Hacker News fosters a prominent startup community. Of course we're going to commiserate with this guy - we can identify with him. It's like posting an article about some dude going through a divorce on a marriage forum. People will commiserate with him. You wouldn't post about an investment banker there. If you posted about an investment banker on an investment banking forum however, I'm sure they would commiserate with him just as we are with this guy.<p>But that's another point entirely, because the investment banker's sorrow for his situation is just as valid as this failed entrepreneur's. Hell, I bet Hitler felt sorry for himself after losing WWII and killing millions of people, and that was just as valid. It is fully understandable for them to feel great pain at their condition, as they poured their hearts and lives into one thing or another, no matter how great or how small, how right or how wrong - they led their lives as they thought best, and it ended in failure or catastrophe - no matter how fleeting. You don't tell a grieving mother who just lost their child that it gets better, that they can just have a new one and really it's not as bad as it could have been, some poor mother just lost all three of her kids! And even though you're right - it does get better, and it could be worse, just as it is in this case, that mother will still grieve the loss of her child and this entrepreneur will still mourn the failure of his company. And deep down inside, I'm sure they know logically that it will get better, that it's not as bad as it could have been - but emotionally, right now, it still feels like the end of the world.<p>This story could easily end one of three ways that I see presently - one, he kills himself now in the height of his emotional sorrow, two, he gets back on the hill and starts another company that either succeeds or fails (in which case, repeat these three cases), or three, he takes a steady job giving a steady income for a stable life but never achieves the great dreams he hoped to (or he starts another company at a later date in which case repeat scenario 2).<p>However, regardless of which path he takes, his pain in the present moment is valid. It is not made any less valid by the fact that he is better off than most people in one of his resultant possible scenarios.<p>Moreover, is it valid for him to want more than his peers? What if he's really not satisfied by leading a stable life with a stable income? Is that okay? Or should we slap him in the face and tell him he's fucking lucky to be where he is and he needs to stop acting so privileged and ungrateful? And if the answer is no, it's not valid for him to want more, then it's equally invalid for us to want anything as well. Where do you draw the line? Are we ungrateful and overly privileged for wanting more than some bland minimally nutritious food and a roof over our heads? Are we ungrateful and overly privileged to want basic plumbing, a nice hot shower, a family that loves us, to be valued in our society and to be able to contribute to our society, anything at all? How is it up to us to judge what others want to accomplish with their lives and consequently impugn their sorrow and pain at failing to achieve what they had hoped to?<p>Another thought - are you going to slap a suicidal middle-class teenager in the face and tell them to grow the fuck up and realize how privileged they are, how <i>most Americans</i> and in fact almost all teenagers in the world are worse off than them? Why not?<p>It's because their pain is valid. Our emotions normalize to our situation - always, no matter how high or low we get in life, and they're just as valid regardless of where they're normalized to. Just because this guy isn't going to be broke for the rest of his life and have his family made homeless doesn't mean he doesn't feel pain, and that pain isn't valid. He poured his heart and soul into something, and it died on him - because of him.<p>The author isn't expressing implicit approval of this entrepreneur's reaction to that text - he's telling a story in its full color, as it so often plays out. This is a universally common response to some sort of suffering. It could easily have been written about a mother who's kid just died of cancer:<p>""She heard the ping of her phone, someone late hearing the news sending a text to offer their condolences. She knew they meant well, but their encouraging platitudes filled her with contempt. What did they know of her pain?""<p>It has nothing to do with his perceived privilege, him being better off than others, etc. If you accept his pain as valid, this is a valid response to that pain.<p>And if you don't accept his pain as valid, then none of us should ever have valid pains - or joys, for that matter, since our joy clearly cannot match the joy of a man given a morsel of bread after having starved for weeks on end, or any other emotion that someone else has experienced as a consequence of a more extreme causative factor.",1353476800

4812980,comment,4807503,4809309,1,0,boboblong,,,"You're simply wrong about gender in Western society today.<p>""As a man I never have to worry about going to the gas station at night because I might be raped.""<p>From the Wikipedia article Gender and Crime:<p>""In 2004, males were almost 10 times more likely than females to commit murder. Men are also far more likely than women to be the victims of violent crime, with the exception of rape.[2]""<p>I'll assume that we're all non-murderers here, so the fact that a man is far more likely than a woman to commit murder has no bearing on whether it's harder to be a man or a woman. Murderers are a tiny percentage of the population, and men have to deal with them just as women do. (An analagous argument is that it doesn't matter that women are far more likely than men to ridicule or ostracize a woman for being promiscuous; women are still judged more harshly than men for sexually deviant behavior.) With that in mind, a man is far more likely than a woman to be the victim of a violent crime. If you're not at all worried about going to the gas station at night, that's probably because you live in a nice neighborhood, not because you're a man. You should probably be more worried than you are, and certainly you should be more worried than a woman should be. Muggings and random assaults are far more common than rape, and the perpetrators overwhelmingly choose to victimize men rather than women.<p>""As a man I never have to worry that someone might slip something into my drink at a bar and assault me.""<p>Why would you think this? You could easily be approached by a beautiful woman, be given a slow-acting sedative, go back to her place thinking you're going to get lucky, and wake up with your clothes, watch, and wallet missing.<p>""As a man I never have to worry that on a date someone might not listen to me when I say no.""<p>Don't be so sure. Your date wouldn't likely be able to overpower you, but there are other methods of coercion. (There are also weapons: <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2194240/Angelina-Jolie-lookalike-stabs-taxi-driver-refusing-sex-her.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2194240/Angelina-Jol...</a>) Or something even worse could happen: she could threaten to accuse you of rape unless you capitulated to some demand.<p><a href=""http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2054510_jail_for_addict_who_threatened_to_cry_rape"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2054510_jail_for_addict_w...</a>\n<a href=""http://justicevids.com/crazy-landlord-assaults-man-realizes-it-was-on-camera-then-acts-like-he-raped-her/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://justicevids.com/crazy-landlord-assaults-man-realizes-...</a> (Warning: there are pornographic ads to the right of this video)<p>""As a man I've never had to worry about sexual advances from my boss costing me my job.""<p>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

If you find my opinion insulting, that's your problem.<p>""In fact, when people post things like that here they're just reinforcing patriarchy.""<p>Ah yes, ""patriarchy"", an unfalsifiable conspiracy theory that ignores all the evidence along with human nature. Please, tell me more.<p>""Things are changing and the role of women in our society is greatly improving, but its not equal.""<p>You're right, it's not equal: women have had a clear advantage for some time now.<p>""To throw out the considerably fewer areas where men are on the short-side of things doesn't add up to some sort of equality.""<p>A few areas, hmmm? Such as<p>- workplace injuries and fatalities\n- suicide rate\n- homeless rate\n- chance of being the victim of a violent crime\n- facing longer sentences for identical crimes\n- divorce and child custody\n- life expectancy\n- having to register for the draft to qualify for, e.g., federal student loans\n- having very little reproductive control compared to women\n- not being able to work with or enjoy the company of children without looking suspicious\n- blamed for everything negative that happened in human history but not given credit for the positives because men of the past allegedly oppressed women (a false allegation, by the way; everyone had a role in society and everyone's behavior was restricted not so much by other people but by circumstance)<p>""This behavior reinforces gender/racial inequalities by painting the people who have to live their lives facing them as ""complainers.""<p>I'm telling you that men face staggering inequality in many areas and you haven't even gone so far as to label me a ""complainer""--you think I'm simply imagining it!",1353475941

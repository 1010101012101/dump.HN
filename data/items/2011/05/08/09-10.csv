2525592,comment,2523824,2524062,4,0,retree,,,"I think the effect is more significant at Oxbridge though. At Oxbridge you have ""supervisions"" or ""tutorials"" as an undergrad. These consist of a 1-on-1 lesson with a fellow or grad student where you are questioned mercilessly on every section of your essay or problem set for an hour. They ask you about every single sentence or step in your solutions. You have to prepare carefully, and even then you have to learn to wing it, because they're going to find flaws you didn't know existed. Given that there is no-one else to back you up or interject with an answer, if you don't learn to wing it quickly, you're screwed.<p>Oh, and most of this article about Oxbridge is complete crap. I'm working 10 hours a day for 6 days a week in order to prepare for my exams this term at Cambridge, and I'm one of the lighter workers (including English/Classics students). I've never been offered sherry (though I did get some wine at the end of last term), and the interview process is nothing like he described. It's bloody intense. I had 2 interviews and 2 tests in a day and felt like I didn't answer a single question correctly.<p>As someone else mentioned, if prospective applicants take this article at face value they're in for a nasty shock.",1304848737

2525561,comment,2523824,2524598,2,0,lhnz,,,"Indeed. Well, I'm not going to be able to create a good argument because mine is also based on the people at Oxford (and Cambridge) that I've met and how they've acted, too. (It could just be that I only meet certain kinds of people?) However, I suspect the author of this articles is speaking falsely because it doesn't match with the reality I've seen/heard. You have some of the brainiest people in the UK there and you expect me to believe that it always comes down to talk?<p>For instance, my brother comes back from Oxford and I see the amount of work he brings back with him. He reads and writes more in one term than many other University's expect from their students in a few years... There are folders and folders of notes proving the workload. The reading lists that he has been provided have <i>not</i> been finished. This is because they're pages long and it is impossible to finish them in the time they are given. He often spends full days revising or reading, and especially now that is exam time he gives himself very few hours to relax. Of course there is a mix of people: some that literally work from 8AM till midnight and others that somehow seem to mix this with being a socialite (perhaps those people don't do any work and just buddy up to the professors by telling them that they do no work!? To me, that sounds bizarre.) Despite the different kinds of people that are there I think it is disingenuous for somebody with a relative that goes there to argue that workaholic study is not encouraged. I have seen the opposite; I have seen people under way too much stress and pressure to succeed and work hard.<p>Okay, not very nuanced but maybe you see why I call it bullshit.",1304846735

A guy in Arrington's position has no excuse for these kinds of problems.<p>His going Palin means nothing to me and it sounds like he's on a narcissistic bender (for the past 3 years).

Not sure what MG and some of the others would do without Arrington's ass-umbrella, though.<p>Hey, but you know, good for him for being a pain in AOL's ass. They've earned it.

2525530,comment,2523824,2524367,3,0,zwischenzug,,,"The article was 90% misleading bullshit. The three years I spent at Oxford studying History were invaluable from an educational perspective, equipping me with skills that allowed me to continue to develop further skills to succeed, and not just by talking well.<p>The 10% is there and undeniable, though. To be a leader you have to have good rhetoric, and that's drilled into you from day one. But there's no denying that you also have to learn when you have to.<p>There's not much mention of the lonely and stressful hours spent in libraries preparing for those tutorials where I had nowhere to hide and a lot of face to lose with a whithering glare from an academic that had better things to do than compensate for my youthful indolence. You don't get that from lectures.",1304845451
2525529,comment,2525467,2525467,1,0,IvoDankolov,,,"This article was very painful to read.<p>> ""It actually explains a few of the trickier things about quantum physics, like why particles have an indeterminate position until they're observed.""<p>And then it goes on in the next paragraph, of all things, to assert that most of the people are ""computer controlled"".<p>The whole thing has the general attitude of ... ooh, we're living in a SIMULATION, let's make some random assumptions that sound audacious. We don't have to care if they hold up for more than a microsecond under scrutiny, because it's a simulation!<p>And while that's an exaggeration, the word simulation does provide an easy excuse, a semantic stop sign as it were, to avoid thinking about the implications of your idea beyond ""hmm, that would be cool.""<p>Fortunately, that's not how it works. Also, as to the whole ""simulating only what's needed"" is in the category of easier said than done. QM might be locally computable at each step, but you can't factor out a part of the universe without affecting its state. And don't even get me started on the problems you'll have if you try to cut out things all the way up at the human level.",1304845450

With GMail, people figured that the AJAX-interactivity was cool, but not groundbreaking.  With Maps, it opened up fundamentally new interaction models that didn't exist before.<p>This is somewhat ironic, since Maps didn't use XHR at all, and instead used an iframe transport.  For that matter, ""AJAX""-enabled Google Search also uses an iframe and contains no XML.  Monikers are weird.",1304845381

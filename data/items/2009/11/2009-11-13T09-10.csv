Who is being taken advantage of here? If you feel abused by such a simple, mutually voluntary agreement, then clearly you need to stop working for the man. While that will be worthwhile no matter how much you make, I'd caution you to rethink your take on your current situation, and your underlying mode of thought. Employees make a certain amount of money even when the company doesn't yet, for the sole reason and on the calculatory basis that if it succeeds, they still don't make that much more money. In return, they only work a fixed number of hours and take some time off for holidays or sickness every once in a while, unless for some reason they choose to work harder and longer than they'd have to, like you did. Go to the other side of the table and be a founder, if you have or have earned the means to take on the financial risks. You certainly have the passion and work ethic to make more money for yourself, but don't take it out on your previous employers now when all they did was stick to their part of your agreement.<p>Other models exist in the world if you don't like that one, such as mutual co-ops, non-profit foundations etc.<p>Oh yeah, your sex life with your girl friend is certainly something you need to sort out yourself too, just like your riches --- your previous or current employers might not care that much.

The only thing that I don't get is the part about the GPU - it takes a <i>lot</i> of computation to tie up an 8800GT for a full minute.

What you see is how cleverly it's being done. The language has to hit the sweet spot between these two extremes - making the how obvious by hiding the what and showing the what by hiding the how. Python is in this sweet spot. Go doesn't seem so.<p>Perhaps this is a problem with Go programmers that will be ironed out eventually.<p>And as for concurrency having its own syntax, I am not sure. I would love (in Python) to have a concurrent list comprehension that spreads the work between as many processors as there are available. OTOH, it could be implemented as a method of generator expressions with semantics like ""with this generator, do 10 values in advance"".<p>Hmmm...<p>Too bad we are in a feature moratorium...",1258105181

939678,comment,939580,939580,0,0,timr,,,"Given the audience of this site, I suppose it shouldn't be surprising that the top answers so far are variants of ""do a startup"".  That's all well and good, but it doesn't really get at the heart of your question.  Assuming that you're even in a position to start a company of your own, in all likelihood, a startup will only mean that you spend the next years of your life working like a dog, with little to no financial upside.  It's not a panacea, and it's not an answer to your question.<p>If you're truly working 80 hour weeks, sacrificing your personal life and youth for a tiny stake in another man's dream, then yes, you're being exploited.  You're an employee, not a martyr for a cause.  The salary and stock options are compensation for a slice of your (extremely limited) time on this planet.  So you need to get your head straight, and take responsibility for what you are: you're a mercenary.  You're trading money for labor.<p>Stock options are like lottery tickets; they're probably worthless.  Value them as such.  So do the math, decide if the total expected compensation is worth the time you're giving.  If you're not being paid enough, cut back on your hours.  Eighty hour weeks are <i>exceptional</i> situations, not the norm.  Adjust your schedule appropriately, and remember that it's <i>perfectly acceptable</i> to demand more compensation for your time.  It's also acceptable to refuse to work longer hours at any price.<p>But that's all strategic advice.  Tactically, I think it's pretty easy:  take a sabbatical.  Get some space.  If you don't have enough money to do that, start saving, then take a sabbatical when you do.  Perhaps even work an hourly job doing mindless labor to make ends meet.  Fix your problems in your relationship by <i>focusing on your relationship</i>, and make a regular habit of sitting on a rock somewhere, staring at the ocean, and thinking really hard about what you want out of life, what you're willing to sacrifice to get it, and how (or if) those two things can meet.<p>Finally, remember that it's not wrong to change your goals to accommodate your life, even if everyone else around you is doing the opposite.",1258105133

So you were ""learning,"" where the financial payoff isn't going to be that high and the real reward was honing your skills and expertise.<p>I say ""when you start your own company"" because it seems this is your issue and it's just a matter of time before you realize it -- you've spent a lot of time ""learning,"" and now it's time to ""earn.""  You can approach this a few different ways.  If your track record at your current company is good, ask them about what it would take for you to get more equity.  If the company is destined for a multi-million dollar payout, just getting a bigger piece of that pie could put your mind at ease.<p>But I suspect what you really need to do is start putting yourself in a position to start your own company.  Brainstorm possible projects that could become startup ideas.  Start saving up money in the event you want to quit and bang out your idea over a few months or something.  Reach out in your personal network and look for possible cofounders.  The good news is that being an engineer, the execution is all in your hands.  You're not just some scrub MBA with a business plan and no way of actually executing -- you can implement any idea you want, largely because of your experience at your previous positions.<p>Soon it won't be long before the tables are turned, and you'll be the charismatic cofounder with a huge financial stake in the company, while a bright young engineer cranks out code for a modest salary -- but with the skills he learns working for you, he could be destined for a payday of his own, and such the cycle continues.",1258103489

That led to a much greater number of people running services from their machine. From the perspective of a startup the idea that a client can run data services without some horrible <nat-related> hack is really interesting.",1258103032

I suppose if I wanted a specific feature I would search for it and then vote for it, which is fine this way, but somehow I suspect a lot of people are just going to me-too vote on something they hadn't thought of wanting, even though some submission on page 50 is something they would much rather see implemented first.",1258102807

9651169,comment,9644290,9646849,0,0,flexd,,,"I do not plan on living with my parents forever. Basically I can either pay like $1000++ per month to rent, which would be money I never see again, or if you have saved up money like I have, I can get a loan and buy something and spend about the same paying down the mortage. Money well spent, because at some point (like 25-30 years) I will own the apartment outright. Of course I will probably not remain in that apartment for the next 25 years, but it is basically an investment. There are only so many places to live in central Oslo, and the demand is always going up. And even if the market crashes and I lose a lot of money, the prices of all the other apartments will be lower as well, so I would be able to buy another place at an equally lower price.<p>Loan interest is very low at the moment, around 2.7-2.9%, and to counter everyone loaning way too much, you need to have 15% of the loan sum in order to qualify. I can expect to pay maybe $320k for a apartment in Oslo, depending on how big and where it is. $320k would typically be >50m2 somewhat central, or 30-40m2 very central (those go for even more).
I will need to have about $48k in cash to be able to get a loan at that price.<p>I also have some student loans, but I have basically my whole life left to pay them off at a very low interest, so I pay like $154 every two months or something I think. It is the best interest loan I am ever going to get, so there is no point just paying it down immediately even if I have the cash for it.<p>TL;DR: Paying for a mortage is better than paying someone else rent, and I do not want to live in my parents basement forever.",1433318240

The most stable systems I&#x27;ve worked on use lsi sas controllers, perhaps software raid, and Intel/crucial ssds in fault tolerant distributed systems.

9651166,comment,9650904,9650987,0,0,kcorbitt,,,"At a startup I worked for several months as a university intern, I ended up (because of my location) working out of the office with the inside sales team instead of engineering. At first it felt like I was in the wrong place, but as I got into the swing of things and really figured out how sales reps were spending their time, I realized that there was a ton of manual labor just related to bookkeeping and tracking leads that was repeated for everyone they contacted.<p>I asked my direct boss&#x27;s permission to be officially moved to the sales team, and spent most of that summer developing a custom CRM that facilitated the flow the sales staff used. When it was finished, the average number of leads contacted per associate increased 40% basically overnight, dramatically affecting the growth rate of the company (and the sales staff absolutely loved me).<p>Any software developer could have built what I did, and had the company realized what they were missing I&#x27;m sure they would have got one of their &quot;real&quot; developers to spend a couple of weeks and probably put something together better than what my intern-self was capable of. The value I added in that situation wasn&#x27;t my engineering prowess, but rather my ability to see exactly what was needed and build the right tool for the job.",1433318182

July 2002 eBay bought PayPal, with the Nasdaq on the floor that Summer, having lost ~75% of its value.

It&#x27;s not in depth and limited to what I usually use.<p>Inspector, HTML editing, Net panel: Basically the same.<p>Storage: you can inspect localstorage and IndexedDB with dev tools. You need <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firestorage-plus/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firestorage-p...</a> for inspecting localstorage with Firebug. No IndexedDB support, but I never used it (localstorage is so much simpler) so I didn&#x27;t search much. Firebug can delete cookies (maybe that&#x27;s another extension, can&#x27;t remember), dev tools can. It could be even, depending on what you use most.<p>Console: dev tools autocompletes functions. Inspection of variables is abot the same but Firebug displays more information without having to browse all the values tree. Firebug&#x27;s console is multiline which is handy for typing in short scripts. However that means that commands run only with CTRL-Enter. I prefer Firebug.<p>HTML structure: the same but the dev tools bury the DOM tab into a right click menu. I prefer Firebug&#x27;s UI.<p>CSS editing: the same.<p>Script/Debugger: almost the same but I prefer Firebug because of the way it displays information about the variables (similar to my reasoning about Console).<p>Aesthetics: Chrome and Firefox dev tools looks more primitive than Firebug to me but this is very subjective and I have a theory about it. Web and mobile have been moving to a minimalistic and flat design for the last few years. Having used computers since the 80s that reminds me of some designs of the 80s/early 90s. The flat Windows 8 desktop mode decorations are somewhat similar to the early Windows (check <a href=""http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/03/operating-system-interface-design-between-1981-2009/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/03/operating-system-int...</a>) with obviously everything that more pixels, colors and animations allow. Still I can&#x27;t feel it a bit deja-vu like some elements of fashion that came back after forty years (example: the brown color - Europe here, USA could be different). Younger folks will say that are Firebug&#x27;s 3D buttons to look dated and I understand it. But just wait some 20 years and I bet you&#x27;ll start having that feeling too :-) As I said: very subjective.<p>Summary: that basic functionality is more or less the same and the difference is probably more a matter of UI and habits than of technical merit. There might be some use cases where you need to dig into dev tools&#x27; options and enable more functionality. Dev tools win there.",1433315485

The question is: why?<p>Frankly I think such a company makes a lot of sense. It&#x27;s easier to teach a software engineer management than it is a manger engineering. That&#x27;s because software engineers are paid to learn all sorts of other domains as part of their work, whereas other folks get into a certain domain and stay there.<p>One of the key reasons such a company makes a lot of sense is that whatever you do, you should be looking to automate it. Part of building a company is this tension between forming a business model and codifying a business engine. Folks should be good at both parts of that.<p>The problem is, the education system wants to stick people in little buckets. Modern education is full of people who are a mile deep, but only an inch wide. So the trick is finding people with broad life experiences and multiple active interests that span much more than just software engineering. Also folks with a lot of different worldviews and personality types, if you want you team to sizzle. Putting all of that criteria together in one place by design can be very tough, if not impossible.

various reasons (students&#x27; motivation has structure different from what will
be in daily job, there&#x27;s lack of big things (longer than half a year) to write

Equals is a lie: = ≠ =&quot;</i><p>This is why languages like Pascal (and it&#x27;s descendents) use := as assignment.<p>There are contradictory opinions about sytnax among programmers. Many programmers don&#x27;t like the example assignment syntax above, but then many programmers also say that syntax is a relatively minor aspect of learning a language (even though the syntax of a language shapes the way you think about solving problems).<p>And many programmers do avoid certain languages precisely because they dislike the sytnax.<p>Nikalus Wirth, who created Pascal, Modula-2 and Oberon, had this to say about using the equal sign for assignment:<p><i>&quot;A notorious example for a bad idea was the choice of the equal sign to denote assignment. It goes back to Fortran in 1957[a] and has blindly been copied by armies of language designers. Why is it a bad idea? Because it overthrows a century old tradition to let “=” denote a comparison for equality, a predicate which is either true or false. But Fortran made it to mean assignment, the enforcing of equality. In this case, the operands are on unequal footing: The left operand (a variable) is to be made equal to the right operand (an expression). x = y does not mean the same thing as y = x.&quot;</i>",1443959070

10327265,comment,10326053,10326620,0,0,manifold,,,"There&#x27;s broadly two approaches actuaries use (I can&#x27;t speak for this particular site which uses UN projections):<p>- One is to look at the average level of mortality improvements in the past at a population (or cohort) level and project those forwards. There are lots of models that do this, for example based on some combination of age, sex, year of birth and calendar year. You make the assumption that even though the specific advances in the past won&#x27;t be repeated, future advances will follow a similar trend. The Lee-Carter model is an easy to understand example, although it&#x27;s not particularly cutting edge.<p>- The other is to look at individual mortality factors (falling smoking levels cause less instances of cancer, etc) and project those forwards based on a mixture of historic advances and expert judgment. With these models you have to take into account that the people not dying of e.g. cancer are now at risk of dying from something else. These models are a lot harder to create because they rely a lot more on expertise. You also don&#x27;t get information about the whole population, so you would end up using a combination of this with the first model.<p>Also, the site sounds like it is using period (i.e calendar year) life expectancy rather than cohort, so it might not be projecting ANY future improvements.

For example, over the period of 1870 to 2012 we added about 1,430 (+- 70) GtCO2 to the atmosphere, and we&#x27;re already observing a +0.8°C mean global temperature increase:<p>> Taking into account CO2 emissions prior to 2014, the remaining emissions quota (from 2015 onwards) associated with a 66% probability of keeping warming below +2°C is estimated to be 1,200 (900–1,600) GtCO2. This +2°C quota will be exhausted in about  30 (22-40) ‘equivalent emission-years’ at the 2014 emission level (40.3 GtCO2 yr^-1). Owing to inter-annual and decadal variability, the actual year when +2°C will be reached is uncertain. The remaining quota associated with a 50% probability of committing to 2  °C of warming is estimated to be 1,500 (1,100–1,900) GtCO2 (Table 1), corresponding to 37 (27–47) equivalent emission-years at the 2014 emission level.<p>So, within the 40 year timeframe mentioned in the link, and assuming (optimistically) that we&#x27;ve reduced global CO2 emissions to 2014 levels (recall: global emissions have been growing by 2.5% each year for the past decade.), we&#x27;ll have hit a 50% chance of having locked in >  +2°C of warming.<p>[1] -- Friedlingstein et al - nature geoscience, 2014 -- pdf version <a href=""http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Friedlingstein_2014_Persistent%20growth%20of%20CO2%20emissions%20and%20implications%20for%20reaching%20climate%20targets.NatureG.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Friedlingstein...</a>",1443956463

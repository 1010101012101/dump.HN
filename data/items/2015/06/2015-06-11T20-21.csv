Frequent travellers can pay for one of these cards, and they gain access to dedicated expedited immigration queues (or, in the absence of a dedicated APEC queue at your airport, you get to use the pilot/aircrew lane). The card costs $150 and is good for 3 years.<p>For business travellers making multiple flights per week, access to programs like these is a godsend (I used to fly internationally at least once per week for work).<p>I do agree with you that all the &quot;security theatre&quot; stuff is a transparent sham, but the existence of programs like precheck isn&#x27;t proof of that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/press/releases/2012/02/29/tsa-pre-check-TM-begins-john-f-kennedy-international-airport"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tsa.gov/press/releases/2012/02/29/tsa-pre-check-T...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://travel.apec.org/abtc-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travel.apec.org/abtc-summary.html</a>",1434055755

However, a while after looking at stack traces that lead to Ramda and not even myself understanding my where each parameter in my own code goes, I decided to stop using it and also dropped these features from Trine. Trine has partial, and that&#x27;s as far as magic goes, in fact I wanted to make it as far from magical as possible. I think plain old functions are the best form of function composition, albeit I&#x27;d love for the syntax to be terser.

When I open the invite it asks me if I am going.  I click &quot;yes&quot; and it adds the event to my calendar.  After work on Friday I use Maps to find the quickest way home through rush hour traffic.  Since I have typed in my destination and run the mapping app, Google&#x27;s algorithms can tell when I get home.  Later in the evening, my watch buzzes and I see a notification that tells me that I&#x27;ll need to leave by 7:34pm to make it to the workshop at 8:00pm in the current traffic.  I swipe away the notification and get ready to leave.  Once I leave, my Nest thermostat switches over to &quot;away&quot; mode since I don&#x27;t need to run the a/c nearly as cool while I&#x27;m away.  Thankfully, since it&#x27;s 94 degrees today, it will use the weather info in my area as well as the indoor thermometer to calculate the most efficient time to start cooling again when I fire up Maps to head back home.<p>This is a scenario that I run into just about every day.  I may not use all of those things every single day but I do on some.  Other times it&#x27;s more basic (calendar reminders or HVAC auto-tweaking for energy efficiency).  Either way, none of it works without analysis of the data I choose to feed it during the course of daily life.<p>And as far as I can tell, they haven&#x27;t &quot;sold&quot; my data to anyone.  What they <i>have</i> done is use it to make educated guesses about where I live and what may be of interest to me.  That way when they sell ad space on the Youtube videos I watch later this evening or on the sidebar of a web search, they can sell that ad space to others who will pay more in the knowledge that their ad budget will be more useful than just a guess.<p>I certainly remember the web before this sort of thing.  Ad space was worth even less than it is now since the only way to stand out was to make your banners more annoying and more abundant.  It was worse than cable/tv where a quarter (or more) of every hour is filled by advertising.  The advertising is almost never relevant to my interests.  It&#x27;s loud and stupid and on top of it, I still have to pay for cable.  To complete the analogy, if Google started a cable network, they could charge $15/mo, show only 10 minutes of ads during an hour-long program, and the ads would at least be for things I would conceivably buy much of the time.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of down sides to targeted advertising but the selling of access to my <i>eyeballs</i> is not the same thing as selling my <i>data</i>.  It may not seem like much but it makes all the difference to me.  In one scenario I consent to one company using the info I give them to enable the services I use.  In the other, I&#x27;m giving consent for a company to sell my actual info to unknown and undisclosed third parties.",1434053952

By the time your CPU can&#x27;t keep up, Intel has a new socket and you need a new motherboard. By the time your video card needs replaced, you&#x27;ll likely need a new PSU to handle the new power requirements. RAM changes slow enough that you might get two or three upgrade cycles from your RAM, but you&#x27;ll likely need more... and if you bought 4x1 GB and now you want 16GB, you&#x27;re throwing it all away anyway. Hard drives are the only things that are easy enough to replace every day, but hard drive tech doesn&#x27;t move that fast.

You split schools into elementary-middle-high (for no especial reason) then treat it all as &#x27;grade school&#x27;.<p>In every European country I&#x27;ve lived in schools are generally split into primary and secondary. Primary school teachers are general educators whose primary skill is teaching but who do not need advanced knowledge in any particular subject. They usually have the same class all day, which gives them a deep insight into students&#x27; progrewss (although from a kid&#x27;s point of view, if you don&#x27;t get on with your teacher then school may suck). In secondary school teachers may teach more than one subject but they&#x27;re required to have studied their primary subject at university and done some additional study in other subjects they teach, as well as additional study in educational methods. So your math teacher has a math degree, your history teacher a history degree and so on. People who plan to teach usually develop themselves academically in two subjects, sometimes three if they&#x27;re closely related or you have special experience. For example: <a href=""http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/_fileupload/Registration/General_and_Special_Requirements_for_Degree_Recognition_June2011%2053901607.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/_fileupload/Registration/Gener...</a><p>California seems to be moving towards this model too: <a href=""http://www.ctc.ca.gov/credentials/leaflets/cl560c.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ctc.ca.gov/credentials/leaflets/cl560c.pdf</a><p>The downside of this is that if a particular teacher is sick and another has to take the class as a substitute, the substitute teacher just babysits, or comes into class with a homework assignment from the sick teacher that should be doable during the class period. The upside is that in general students are keenly aware that <i>teachers know what they&#x27;re talking about</i> and are considerably more expert in the subject than would be possible using the assigned textbooks.<p>I&#x27;ve ranted on HN before about how destructive of educational ends the practice of using &#x27;Teacher&#x27;s Editions of textbooks with scripts and answer keys is. It degrades teaching to a branch of bullshit artistry, and students who take a subject seriously can quickly detect a lack of true expertise.<p>Obviously this short comment isn&#x27;t meant as an accurate descriptor of the whole state of the US education system, just the legacy of the non-specialization referred to in the grandparent comment.",1434053877

The nuclear tests increased that by multiple orders of magnitude, ejecting hundreds of kilograms into the stratosphere, whereupon it promptly precipitated back out into the earth&#x27;s oceans.<p>1) Your link does not discuss tritium.  Tritium is a specific substance with specific characteristics; you can&#x27;t just lump it all under &quot;Evil Radiation&quot; and make meaningful conclusions.<p>2) Whatever effect tritium would have would be global.  You talk about local extinctions, but we&#x27;re actually looking for evidence of massive <i>global</i> extinctions.  The early 1960s (which saw peak tritium levels) are not known for a huge spike in inexplicable extinction events.<p>3) Not only did the tests spread it everywhere, but ongoing runoff means that rivers have been pumping tritium into delta regions.  Almost a kilogram of tritium was pumped into the Gulf of Mexico over the last 50 years.  Again, no impacts <i>from the tritium</i> have been detected; whatever impact it might have had was drowned out by all the other much more serious crap we humans were doing.<p>4) Again, there&#x27;s still no theory as to how tritium (specifically tritium, and not, eg, radioactive cesium or iodine) might do all this crazy stuff.  I&#x27;m just pointing out that there&#x27;s also no emperical evidence either, and thus, no real reason to think our entire understanding of how radiation impacts living organisms is wrong.<p>All of which means that people worried about the impacts of <i>4 grams</i> of tritium on the <i>Pacific Ocean</i> are—to be charitable—innumerate.  They&#x27;re certainly wrong, because we&#x27;ve already dumped something like a HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES more tritium into  the Pacific ocean than that, and we literally have been unable to detect any impact.

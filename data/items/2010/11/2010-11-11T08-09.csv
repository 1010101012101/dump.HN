1893263,comment,1893000,1893000,0,0,drblast,,,"Lisp is my happiness language, and everything else isn't.  So for me there are really two types.<p>Every language that's not Lisp, while obviously inferior, usually has some domain-specific use.<p>I do get a huge kick out of C and assembly when I get the chance to do something low-level.  It's a lot of fun to get in there and make something totally non-portable that runs 1000 times faster than the equivalent C++ program.<p>Getting small things done quickly used to mean Perl, but recently I've started to use Lisp for short scripts because Perl's built-in data structures are so poorly implemented.  Last week I was playing around with parsing huge volumes of U.S. census data, which should have been Perl's bread and butter, but ten lines into the Perl script I missed map and nested lists so I switched to Lisp and was done in short order.<p>I've done a few things with Python, but nearly every design decision they made early on rubs me the wrong way.<p>I like Javascript for the same reasons I love Lisp.  I have a feeling I'd really like Haskell if I could find the time to learn it fully.<p>And then there are the languages I consider to be abominations, like C++ and Java.  Still, they have some great IDE's and libraries which make up for the language in some cases.  I haven't gotten around to C# or F# yet.  I don't know if I want to.<p>There are so few honestly awful programming languages.  I have been forced to use a few, including Visual Basic for Applications, Matlab script, and a few other proprietary domain-specific languages that I've long since forgotten.<p>So three languages?  Pssh.  Learn as many as you can, enough to complete a useful project or two in each.  After you do that, you'll realize that Lisp is the best by far and you've wasted most of your time.  But at least you'll KNOW.",1289463477

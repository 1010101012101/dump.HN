3913065,comment,3912696,3912696,3,0,mc32,,,"This has to be for self-consumption, as I can't imagine they would believe people would take their statements at face value.  Example:<p>>The encampments that characterized the movement during Fall 2011 enabled formerly disparate and disconnected groups of people to build vast in-person and online networks.<p>What I saw in SF, from the visits was a kind of alien landscape -a kind of flavela.  To me it looked worse than a refugee camp.  It was more like a political re-enactment of Woodstock.  There appeared to be little care (garbage, refuse, mud, signs, etc.) which revealed what appeared to be carelessness.  In Japan, for example, there are homeless, but their spaces are as clean as can be, given the circumstances.  Is that dignity?  In any event, it was not welcoming to me.<p>>Protesters have succeeded in implanting We are the 99 percent,<p>Thanks for coopting me.  While statistically true, in a fiscal sense, I share little with the ""movement"" beyond that coincidence (and a few other intersections).<p>>In response to the failure of mainstream media to cover the movement, protesters have created various independent media sources including newspapers, radio programs, and websites.<p>What planet are they on that's half year behind the news.  For weeks, if not months, all you could see on TV and online was OWS coverage --mostly from a naive, non-judgmental pov.<p>>Thousands of protesters have been educated on the consensus model of decision-making, a form of direct democracy pioneered by anarchists. Yes, anarchists.<p>Except, that model of decision-making is suboptimal.  Wherever I've been exposed to this model, it's tedious and virtually fruitless.<p>>Protesters have shined a grim spotlight on the militarization of local police forces.<p>Has it really become militarized?  What does that even mean, beside trying to hook on to a loaded word.  If anything, it seems to me police are far less ruthless and more accountable than they were back in the 1900-1960s.<p>>Encampments across the country have fed and clothed local homeless populations despite scant resources.<p>Good.  Not sure that's what they set out to do, but, sure. On the other hand, their destructive tendencies (sticking it to the man, I guess) caused local govs to spend money they didn't have, possibly making it worse for the homeless, in a medium term.<p>>The Occupy movement has brought attention to rapidly ballooning student debt, expected to reach $1 trillion during Spring 2012.<p>Anyone who has been and is a student is ""aware"" of this, as well as parents of students.  It is a big problem (in my opinion) and needs addressing.<p>If the movement, is going to achieve anything meaningful I think they need to lock onto something meaningful which will bring about significant change.  Something like ending the enormous influence of PACs, or reining back the personification of the corporation.  Do something that's impactful but perhaps not as glamorous or as ""revolutionary"" as pretending they're at war with the establishment.  I mean, it sounds funny to me how they talk about militarization and so on meanwhile their speech is very much in tune with that of revolutionaries and dictatorships --you know, people who bear arms and kill each other.",1335848176

At this point, it looks like someone took Lua, added a dash of Python, and then added ""fixes"" here and there because why the hell not. Like the fact that you can't put an array over multiple lines without adding a backslash (I guess?). The fact that you have not just == but ==? and ==#. Sure, there are reasons for this, but there shouldn't be. The fact that you can abbreviate everything, which sounds like a good idea, but sure makes code harder to read. The fact that there's no module system or anything, functions in the ""standard library"" are just there out in space (fortunately, they're named consistently and they have okay names). The fact that you have to scope functions because a capitalized function is Special. The fact that to call a function, you have to use call() because otherwise Vim interprets it as a command. (Unless it's scoped?) Oh, and Vim regexes don't conform to any standard you might be used to (except for \v, but I don't know that that conforms to).<p>So yeah I am not an expert.

It's easy, as it is in Scheme, to do procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming in Lua (and even mix them).<p>2) Lua syntax can be pretty (although I've found that it doesn't lend itself well to embedded DSLs).<p>3) Lua is distributed as a very small library with an intuitive (at least for me, YMMV) C API, which makes it trivial to embed.<p>4) The Lua VM is more performant than Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and Tcl (although you get far fewer libraries; no batteries included).  There's also the LuaJIT implementation, which is the fastest dynamic language implementation I know of (and it's fully compatible with the stock C API).<p>5) Lua is straightforward to learn (at least as straightforward as Python or QBasic), yet has a lot to offer the more knowledgeable programmer.<p>6) The documentation is detailed, specific, and concise.<p>All of these points make Lua an <i>excellent</i> language for embedding into applications (which is what it was originally designed for), but it's not often an excellent choice for general-purpose programming or even general-purpose scripting.  Point 1 is a double-edged sword, just like it is in Scheme: you often end up with many different object systems, module systems, etc. in different codebases which can be painful for interop.

Conversion data gives you correlations, not reasons for the correlations. I prefer to work from a theory of causality when I'm deciding what to put on the page.",1335845013
3912942,comment,3912149,3912723,5,0,nknight,,,"I'm forced to wonder from your comments throughout this thread whether you have much real-world development experience, versus having just ingested a bunch of theoretical information on best practices. The things you're dismissing out of hand happen all the time, and while sometimes they're useless, more often they're all the documentation you'll get, and you'll feel exceedingly lucky to get even them.<p>Your comment about Puppet is especially troubling. Puppet doesn't ""have appropriate permissions"", it's a root-level tool for managing system state. The files it manages may have all kinds of ownership and permissions, some of which are <i>not</i> ones you can just mess with (e.g. the system will throw up its hands and bomb out if they're wrong), and all of which are still modifiable by anyone with root access. There's no way to differentiate short of comments in the files themselves.",1335844974

Within 3 years we may see devices that have only persistent RAM.  And for large files, I bet we'll see some nice competition between Dropbox, Google, Microsoft, and others which may eventually lead to making hard drives obsolete.<p><pre><code>  Nah, don't think so; the computer is the computer. \n  Network... is not reliable, responsive, or resilient enough to.\n</code></pre>\nNot yet, but I think we are steamrolling toward this conclusion.<p>Apple might have successfully convinced everyone into thinking that downloading software and installing it is some fancy new thing, but really just it's old-fashioned nonsense that is only necessary for their arcane software platform to work.",1335844894

You guys should add a button to Google search results that would completely invert the result list, and show the lowest stuff first, highest stuff last.  Almost like sorting a list of products by price.<p>Anything you can identify as pure SEO spam, exclude of course.  But if it's some original content that just isn't well connected or whatever, include it.<p>Then just observe user behavior for a while until you can discern patterns in how people who play around with that use it to discover new and interesting stuff.

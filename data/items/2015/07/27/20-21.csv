Meshtags are exactly equivalent to the following hypothetical service which I call &quot;SuperNumericShortener&quot;:<p>1. Pick any random number, say 1234. This is your identifier.<p>2. Register this identifier and your URL at SuperNumericShortener.com<p>3. Write &quot;SNS-1234&quot; anywhere you want.<p>4. Install a fancy smartphone app that can take a picture of a writing and recognize &quot;SNS-1234&quot;.<p>5. The app opens your browser to <a href=""http://SuperNumericShortener.com/1234"" rel=""nofollow"">http://SuperNumericShortener.com/1234</a> which redirects to whatever URL you chose.<p>That&#x27;s it. Oh and you can pay to reserve short identifiers (since they are likely to be claimed by other users of the service).<p>And for some reason meshtags use triangular shapes instead of numbers. Maybe it makes the concept look fancier than what it really is. Or maybe the author thought it would be easier to recognize a meshtag than detecting the shape &quot;SNS&quot; and do OCR to extract the following identifier? Either way, &quot;SNS-1234&quot; is easier to memorize, faster to draw, can be communicated in writing and speech. All advantages that meshtags lack.<p>Edit: here is something I would really want: in my Android Chrome address bar, next to the microphone icon, I want a camera icon that lets me snap a picture of a written URL, and opens it directly.

It has certain advantages, but is not necessary in order to have those advantages. For example, it makes use of malloc easier, but one could also make the vast majority of uses of malloc easier with something like<p><pre><code>    #define ALLOC(TYPE,N) ((TYPE*)malloc(N*sizeof(TYPE)))\n</code></pre>\nOr at least, one <i>could</i> if C had a remotely regular type syntax and/or actual type genericity. In contrast, you actually <i>can</i> write<p><pre><code>    template <typename T>\n    T* alloc(std::size_t n) {\n        return static_cast <T*> (malloc (n * sizeof (T)));\n    }\n</code></pre>\nin C++, and it&#x27;s even straightforward to add additional logic like overflow detection. Mark it inline and stick it in a header, and it&#x27;s effectively the same as the above ALLOC macro, except that it actually <i>works</i>. Now, contrast<p><pre><code>    int* array = malloc(256*sizeof(int));\n</code></pre>\nwith<p><pre><code>    int* array = alloc<int> (256);\n</code></pre>\nThe C++ expression is simpler. Now, if you change the type of the array, but forget to change the allocation expression (for whatever reason; maybe you&#x27;re using the absurd convention of declaring all your variables before you start initializing and using them):<p><pre><code>    char* array = malloc(256*sizeof(int));\n    // vs\n    char* array = alloc<int> (256);\n</code></pre>\nYou get a type error with the C++ version, and the C version silently compiles. Not too much of an issue in this case -- you&#x27;ll just waste a bunch of memory -- but go from char to int instead of int to char, and now you&#x27;ve got buffer overflows.<p>As for the argument made elsewhere in this thread that explicitly casting the result of malloc in C can mask the fact that malloc has been implicitly delcared, that&#x27;s a language bug -- one that was <i>fixed</i> more than fifteen years ago.",1438030568

The point isn&#x27;t about healthcare spending. It&#x27;s about programs of &quot;measurable and direct&quot; outcome to the benefit of the population. (This distinction is common, as is evidenced by the Forbes Tax Misery Index -- <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0413/034-tax-misery-reform-index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0413/034-tax-misery-reform...</a>).<p>Your R&D link doesn&#x27;t at all respond to my point about R&D as a fraction of taxes, as it doesn&#x27;t separate government-owned industry from truly private industry. Keep in mind that 74% of major companies in China are state-owned.<p>Your quote -- &quot;Wednesday, the Chinese central government announced both the allocation of 1.13 trillion yuan ($185.8 billion) for upgrading internet infrastructure and the creation of a 124.3 billion yuan fund for affordable housing. These expenditures follow Monday’s authorization of six new rail lines costing 250 billion yuan.&quot; -- directly supports my position that the government of China is forced to allocate tax capital to infrastructure expenses because they do not have adequate private infrastructural management.<p>If China is planning to increase their Healthcare expenditure 10-fold, that will come at the expense of higher taxes, as again, they are not prepared for the private management of infrastructure.<p>While the point about US healthcare &quot;mismanagement&quot; is largely irrelevant in a break-down of tax expenditure, it&#x27;s worth responding to, as that is a commonly held misunderstanding about the American healthcare industry:<p>That belief is largely derived from the fact that healthcare R&D, and the costs associated with it, are not factored into the international cost equation.  Yes, American Healthcare is expensive, but it&#x27;s also driving global healthcare outcomes forward.  Those countries with low costs are benefiting directly from our healthcare expenditures, without paying their fair share, because they don&#x27;t respect our patents, and push their costs off onto American tax payers by threatening to just steal our medicine if we don&#x27;t give it to them at a price they agree with.<p>To put a fine point on that, the US had 32,139 Biotechnological patents, and 43,317 Pharmaceutical patents from the period of 2001-2009. The UK produced 3,062 & 5,693 in that same period, that makes them fourth in the world, and they still produce roughly a tenth what we&#x27;re producing in terms of medical R&D. Yes, their healthcare system can operate very cheaply, but it does so at the cost of innovation, and on the backs of the American medical system. Given that we are producing the vast majority of the world medical research, the impetus for increased costs in our healthcare system should be obvious -- we&#x27;re producing most of the medicine. If we nationalize our medical system, yes, we could get prices down too, but we&#x27;d also be destroying the world&#x27;s medicine R&D system in one fell swoop.

It is the job of UN weapons inspectors to ensure chemical weapons are not being stockpiled. Stockpiles are harder to hide than the smaller quantities that many labs can produce.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say it needs 100% to make an effect I just asked what your definition of successful meant in relative terms. We&#x27;re getting a little off track here but the big takeaway here is that the process to create chemical weapons largely doesn&#x27;t have a lot of areas in which further advancement in technologies can help people (some exists, sure, but I&#x27;m not convinced a lot). This is counter to AI where there are thousands of applications for AI in everyday life from driving to medical equipment; so much of this advancement is knowledge and technology that can easily be moved into the military sector.<p>> but hardware is part of the equation and needs to be manufactured.<p>But why? Yes I&#x27;m sure they would make specialized hardware but it&#x27;s not like they <i>need</i> to. There is plenty of equipment on the ground and in the air controlled by either a remote human or by a human through direct interfacing with the machine. There is no reason these existing points which contain a human can&#x27;t be swapped with a relatively advanced AI should one be created in the future.<p>So hardware is part of the equation but it&#x27;s not like anything needs to be radically altered. In fact it may be advantageous to keep the same looking hardware so the enemy doesn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s an AI controlling it.<p>> Furthermore, in both cases, they are physical objects. Making these physical objects illegal to own and operate is the goal. Do you oppose this?<p>Making what objects illegal to own and operate? Objects controlled by AI, objects that contain weaponry, objects that contain weaponry and AI? How do you sufficiently define AI? What constitutes a weapon? Can the drone itself be considered a weapon?<p>It may make sense to make owning certain, dangerous things illegal but I&#x27;m not convinced it solves the problem we are discussing. In all honestly if someone could mass produce a machine with a decent amount of weapons on it then, depending on a ton of details, I could see those overtaking towns or cities; hell maybe even overtake small countries depending on how they&#x27;re built. So it&#x27;s tough to just simply say it&#x27;s illegal for the members of the UN, so they don&#x27;t research it at all, and non-members of the UN end of researching it and developing something incredible.",1438029172

Most of those loans and grants don&#x27;t go to people who view a degree as a status symbol or a signalling device; they go to people who, rightly or wrongly, sincerely believe that a degree will give them a chance at a better life, and the wide availability of financial aid means that more people are likely to come to that conclusion. (IMO, we&#x27;ve pushed that lever too far; many of the people now using loans and grants to get degrees will not get enough of a better life to make it worth it to them. But that&#x27;s a whole other discussion.)",1438028875

But in all likelihood there is a logistic curve to human material needs as well.<p>If we did have $30,000 more on average, as the article states, how would it be used? The case is obvious for the poor, but as you go to higher income brackets more and more of the possibilities fall into &quot;luxury&quot; and &quot;status symbol&quot;.<p>Take, for example, the rise in the cost of college education. It&#x27;s absolutely bizarre that in an era of low fiction information, tuition has actually gone up. That is, until you consider the credentialing as a form of signalling for limited jobs at the high end. The colleges aren&#x27;t getting funded to expand the core mission of education, they&#x27;re chasing each other to provide a premium experience that will attract people with a pedigree, who subsequently raise the status of that institution.<p>From that angle, automation&#x27;s effect is to shuffle around the job landscape, not to directly increase productivity. More minds on higher value jobs - but eventually we start cutting into the highest value stuff we can think of. What automation doesn&#x27;t do for us is expand our ability to be creative about what work is and what jobs could be done that aren&#x27;t. That capability is directed through our social structures and &quot;what people will pay for.&quot; Anyone good at conversation knows that you can have the same room and the same people and achieve wildly varying outcomes in discussion.

If you live in an area where houses cost more than $300,000, take a close look at the rent prices around the areas you currently drive. Budget your driving costs at at least a dollar per mile (80 cents/km in Canada to account for higher costs) because you absolutely must put a high value on your spare time to get ahead in life. Doing the math on life decisions like this was by far the biggest factor in my own early financial independence.<p>Buying a house is a great thing to do when you’re settling down in a beautiful, affordable spot right near everything you need to do for the next ten years. And if your schedule and temperament allow some time for a good several hours a week of maintenance work. But for the rest of us, it’s worth having another look at Rent vs. Buy.&quot;<p>Which seems to be good advice.",1438028082

Maybe it is better to just focus on producing quality blog content instead.<p>Being a dev myself, I have attended maybe 3 webinars in my 10-year career.",1438027304

For example, A depends on B and B depends on C, etc. If you have A depends on B... and somehow along the path you have a cycle, eg. E depends on A, you have a problem because in order to install A, you need to install B, C,... E. But in order to install E you need to install A <i>first</i>. So you have to break the dependency cycle.",1438027262

We&#x27;re beginning to share more about our project with this new site.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an expert iOS engineer to join us in Williamsburg, NY. You can reach me directly at joseph@onuniverse.com.<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer questions here as well.<p>—<p>What if creating software was more like playing an instrument? Or painting on a canvas? We’re building a new kind of “programming language”: a multi-sensory set of tools that makes creating software fun. It&#x27;s designed from the ground-up for your smartphone, the computer we all have.<p>Your canvas is a card. Cards can be anything, from a game to a cookbook—and anyone can make them, no coding required. The cards you make exist in Universe, a rethinking of the Web for mobile. We’re taking today’s technology and three decades of learnings to design a new, open software platform.",1438027218

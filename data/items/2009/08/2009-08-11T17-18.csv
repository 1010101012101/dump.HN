755844,comment,755131,755131,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"<i>Here’s a self-enforcing protocol for determining property tax: the homeowner decides the value of the property and calculates the resultant tax, and the government can either accept the tax or buy the home for that price. Sounds unrealistic, but the Greek government implemented exactly that system for the taxation of antiquities. It was the easiest way to motivate people to accurately report the value of antiquities.</i><p>I had an idea a while ago about stopping domain name squatters by using a similar protocol to price and tax domain names. You'd be required to report the ""fair value"" of each domain you owned. All your domains (maybe there could be exceptions for trademarks) would be implicitly for sale at that fair price. To keep the reported price from being too high, you'd have to pay some fraction of that price as a yearly domain name tax. That way, if anyone has a better use for your domain than you do, they can just buy it from you. Of course, if you build a brand and a trademark, you should have some protection from competitors just buying your domain. Maybe only other similar trademark holders could compete for your domain (eg, Apple Computers and Apple Music could fight it out to see who gets more value out of apple.com).",1250013560

This can just be a temporary setup until we can afford to provide each with a laptop so they can telecommute -- would you recommend this? Would devs be just as productive as having their own machine?
Cost-wise, the initial investment appears to be at least 60% less -- but I wouldn't be too keen if productivity would suffer.",1250010586

For instance, a gallon of gasoline contains about 33 kWh of energy, but an normal car wastes about 2/3 of this, netting only 11 kWh per gallon.<p>Logically, an electric car should arrive at an MPG by calculating the number of miles that it would travel on this same amount of energy.  Instead, the EPA has told all-electric companies that they can do this computation using 82 kWh (almost 7.5 times more than the logical value), giving all-electric cars a huge benefit (Nissan's upcoming electric has claimed 367 MPG).<p>Plug-in electric cars use a different value, which is somewhere between the two, giving Chevy some magic number in between.  Just to confuse matters, the EPA sticker on the electric Mini quotes kWh/100 mi, giving it ""33"" city and ""36"" highway, numbers that resemble current gasoline car mileages.<p>(more info: <a href=""http://www.hybridcars.com/fuel-economy-numbers/confusion-over-mpg-ratings-electric-cars-25946.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hybridcars.com/fuel-economy-numbers/confusion-ove...</a>)<p>[EDIT: Also, it has been said that the gasoline engine in the Volt will provide around 50 MPG.

You're right: mistakes are acceptable. Given that, you have to base your decision on whether the person is a match for your needs on more than just a coding exercise during an interview.<p>Second, and more importantly, a coding exercise during an interview is long, long way from working in a startup, or working of pretty much any kind -- unless you've somehow managed to find a way to get paid for solving toy problems. I've done both, and both are hard, but in different ways. To use running analogies, working in a startup (in my experience) is a relay: you have a team, each of you is carrying your own respective bit of the endeavor, but the success or failure proposition is net across the team. In an interview, you're running a sprint, and all eyes are on you, and you alone. One feels completely different from the other, because it is.<p>Also, half the times (for a sample size of two) I've been asked to do a code exercise during an interview, the interviewer realized halfway through the exercise that he'd misrepresented the specifications of the widget I was supposed to make. The plural of ""anecdote"" may not be ""data"", but I've seen and heard, and can conceive of enough problems with the practice of interview coding exercises that I just can't trust them for anything more than exploring how a candidate <i>approaches</i> programming: the way they <i>think</i>.",1250010104

9969054,comment,9966201,9967403,0,0,jcranmer,,,"It&#x27;s worth noting that the Supreme Court has generally given rulings that suggest that intimate that software patents are broadly unpatentable. The key decision that allowed software patents in the first place was State St., which was never heard by the Supreme Court (indeed, in Bilski, every opinion went out of their way to emphasize just how <i>wrong</i> State St. was).<p>Between Bilski, Alice, and even the older decisions of Benson, Flook, and Diamond v. Diehr, SCOTUS has generally held that most software patents are basically inherently invalid. It should also be pointed out that many patents favored by trolls would also fail obviousness and/or prior art tests: the problem isn&#x27;t that the patents are valid, it&#x27;s that trolls can extract money from people by charging them somewhat less than the cost to go to court to prove that the troll&#x27;s patents are invalid.<p>One way you could fix the system is to punish the trolls for knowingly peddling invalid patents: if an entity gets three patents invalidated by the court system and they&#x27;ve been aggressive in suing people for compliance with those invalid patents, then all patents that they hold are summarily invalidated and they get prohibited from enforcing any patents for 5 years. On top of having to reimburse everyone they charged (plus damages… plus interest ☺).",1438181990

Usually, just knowing that it is possible that a participant in the discussion could be a paid propagandist is enough to spot likely candidates.  While you can never really know for sure, if you check their posting history, and they only seem to care about exactly one thing, that&#x27;s a strong indicator of suspicion.<p>On some of the message boards I frequented in the past, the general subject matter was such that it was extraordinarily easy to spot the cop whenever one showed up.  They always did exactly the same thing, and it never worked even once.  It usually went something like this.<p><pre><code>  A: Hey guys, we should get together and *do* something.\n  B: Sure.  Tell us your plan and we&#x27;ll tell you if we&#x27;re in.\n  A: [*describes an overtly criminal act, usually involving violence*]\n  C: Go back to writing traffic tickets, undercover cop.\n  D: Do you actually get paid to annoy us, or are you doing it on a volunteer basis?\n  B: You should take a look at your bosses instead of spying on us.\n  E: [*spouts unrelated crackpot claptrap*]\n  (end of thread)\n</code></pre>\nOn a more general forum, such as HN, with a much larger and more diverse audience, it is a bit more difficult to spot the paid propagandist.  And the professionals have honed their skills in the past few years.  They spend more time setting up for the payoff, building reputation and credibility, before using an identity for a mission-critical message.  They almost certainly have voting rings set up on every site that uses voting.<p>Anyway, any genuine NK astroturfers would probably be doing it from a non-NK IP block.

I own the domain usefultoolapp.com, and I control the name &quot;Useful Tool&quot; on the iOS app store. I&#x27;ve had both of these under my control for months.<p>Yesterday, I got an email from an independent developer in Europe. He apparently released an Android app called Useful Tool on the Google Play store last week. It&#x27;s the same genre of app and has the same general functionality (although, honestly, it&#x27;s a relatively shoddy piece of work, but I&#x27;m biased). He emailed me after seeing my pre-launch website, which has some screenshots and a description.<p>While he didn&#x27;t make any overt threats, but said he was going to make an iOS version, and ended with the vague statement, &quot;I just wanted to let you know that an app called Useful Tool exists already to avoid issues of confusion between two apps of the same name.&quot;<p>I would be very skeptical of something shady going on, but since I only put actual images of the app on my site a couple of weeks ago, I&#x27;m inclined to chalk this up to an astonishing coincidence. There&#x27;s just no way he could have deliberately created a similar app in less than a week.<p>My question: Am I in a position - legally, ethically, business-wise - to keep going with my original name? We&#x27;ll technically be in different stores, and I don&#x27;t feel I owe him the name on iOS just because he intends to eventually write an iOS version.<p>I also love the name, and in the spirit of competition, I think I should be able to own the Google search results soon after I release.

When you&#x27;re saying nigger, you give away the option of not meaning nigger, because you cannot use the word free of its connotation: it&#x27;s there, no matter how you use it. Dogwhistle terms used instead of nigger do not have that universal connotation to them, which is precisely why they are used: they can slip under the radar.<p>So what to do? Honestly, this is extremely simple: don&#x27;t say nigger if you don&#x27;t want people to equate what you&#x27;re saying with the connotation your words carry.

When a client presents a 1.5MB block to both nodes, Node A rejects it for being too big but Node B accepts it for being small enough.  Since clients and miners ask for new blocks from nodes, anyone that asks for blocks from Node A would not get the 1.5MB block, but would get it if they had asked Node B.  If 10% of node agree with Node A, then the 1.5MB block could be gotten by a lot of clients and miners, but not all.  If 50% agree with Node A, then you have a serious problem in which a lot of people are not going to get the 1.5MB block and a lot of miners will spend their time on it for probably no ultimate benefit.<p>Thus, the problem does not really begin until any miners start accepting blocks from the chain of blocks that will eventually be rejected by the network generally.  Unfortunately, there is no way to tell ahead of time which is the right side of the fork, but this could last for  hours.

The problem is there are a LOT of general aviation aircraft out there.<p>Drive by a GA airport and look at all the planes; many of them are 30, 40, sometimes 50+ years old. Now, this is not a big deal in the aviation world. Airplanes are pretty simple compared to most modern cars. They are also required to be inspected once a year by a mechanic (an &quot;annual&quot;), engines are replaced or rebuilt after a certain time interval has passed (usually around 2000 hours), extensive documentation is required to be kept, etc.<p>But there are just a LOT of them out there, so refitting all of them takes time. Unlike the car world where, if you make a change in the law, you can reasonably expect in 10-15 years the majority of cars would be compliant just because people buy new cars. In the aviation world that isn&#x27;t the case. New airplanes can easily run $200k+, so people hold on to airplanes for decades.<p>It&#x27;s also expensive. Anything involving airplanes is hellishly expensive. :)<p>You&#x27;re looking at probably about $5k for equipment + installation costs (which must be done by a mechanic, pilots generally aren&#x27;t allowed to work on their own aircraft [1]). And that only broadcasts your position; a separate ADS-B receiver must also be purchased if you want to actually see other airplanes around you. The cheapest one I can find is $500, and that also requires a tablet and software.<p>So yeah, we&#x27;re going to get there.

Create a company (not yet created because I work in finance, and if I create a company I have to tell my boss for legal reasons...)<p>2. Make sure the company owns the IP of the tool I developed<p>3.

In contrast, programmers prioritize code organization (formulas) over the visual grid.

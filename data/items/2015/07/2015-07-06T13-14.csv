Otherwise, Occam&#x27;s razor suggests that this is just the on-line form of the culturally endemic male abuse of vulnerable women.<p>> Indictments of whole industries are worse than distractions.<p>Nope! Definitely not. People are perfectly happy to let problems exist when they&#x27;re on a large enough scale, because they don&#x27;t see themselves as having a way to act.

Here&#x27;s the abstract:
&quot;This report is a study of monetary problems in Iceland and in what part they may be caused by the current monetary mechanism, the fractional reserve system.
There is indication that the fractional reserve system may have limited the Central Bank&#x27;s ability to control the money supply while giving banks both the power and incentive to create too much money. Indeed, commercial banks expanded the money supply nineteen-fold in the fourteen year period that ended with the banking crisis of 2008.
There is also indication that the fractional reserve system may have been a long term contributing factor to various monetary problems in Iceland, including: hyperinflation in the 1980s, chronic inflation, devaluations of the Icelandic Krona (ISK), high interest rates, the government foregoes income from money creation, and growing debt of private and public sectors.
Economists have long been aware of the problematic nature of the fractional reserve system and proposed various reforms. A program for monetary reform by Fisher et al in 1939 received the support of 235 economists from 157 universities and colleges but was not imple- mented. This report reviews some of the more frequently mentioned proposals for monetary reform: 100% Reserves, Narrow Banking, Limited Purpose Banking and describes in detail the Sovereign Money proposal.
In a Sovereign Money system, only the central bank, owned by the state, may create money as coin, notes or electronic money. Commercial banks would be prevented from creating money.
This report describes how such a Sovereign Money system could be implemented and what steps would be required for a successful transition.&quot;",1436189389

Or by putting it on a dialup BBS download area. Or by including it on a CD you try to sell people of thousands of mostly crappy shareware/freeware (&#x27;freeware&#x27; another word that&#x27;s sort of been eclipsed by the &#x27;open source&#x27; revolution), which people are still happy to pay $5 or $10 for, because it was hard to get software otherwise, people didn&#x27;t have access to an internet with all the software!<p>Shareware often had all software features unlocked immediately, but encouraged people to pay if they liked it and continued using it. Or maybe not &#x27;encouraged&#x27;, often &quot;required&quot; by terms of the license, but with no real enforcement mechanism, really just the honor system<p>Or occasionally locked some features until you had bought a license -- but that was rare in the pre-internet era, because there wasn&#x27;t a good cheap way to exchange money for license keys, that didn&#x27;t require building up an expensive infrastructure.<p>All of these business models are still in use. For instance, you can download SublimeText for free, and use it as long as you want -- buying a SublimeText license does nothing but disable the popup message on startup that says &quot;Please buy a license if you find this useful.&quot; I forget the language it uses, how strongly it tries to tell you that you _must_ buy a license to continue using it, but either way it&#x27;ll let you keep using it forever with the startup popup message, without paying.  It&#x27;s essentially &quot;shareware&quot; as far as that goes -- but there&#x27;s no need for users to obtain a copy by their friends who already have a copy &#x27;sharing&#x27; one; everyone can just download a copy from the ST website themselves.<p>Some things that basically use this &#x27;business model&#x27; are actually open source -- you legally _can_ use the software for whatever you want without paying for it, but if you&#x27;d like to support the developers, send money.

9838879,comment,9837307,9838242,0,0,deckiedan,,,"The separate PA thing means that you lose all phase related issues (providing the vocal PA is a mono single effective source, rather than a pair of speakers...).<p>You hardly ever pan main vocals anyway, so you&#x27;re normally using your stereo pair to produce a mono sound.  In other words, both speakers are producing the same sound at the same time.  Since hardly anyone in the audience is an equal distance from both speakers, they&#x27;ll hear a messy comb-filtered version of the main vocals, rather than them cleanly.<p>You can make a very good argument for not bothering with stereo at all for live sound (except for effect stuff, but then we&#x27;re back into separate-pa-for-each-instrument grounds...).  The trouble with that is how much harder that is to rig.  If you&#x27;re stacking stuff on the ground at all, then you can&#x27;t really stack center stage, you need to stack to the sides. (Or behind the stage, with all the feedback issues that involves).  If you do fly your PA, then you still need legs, usually.  And a big PA is <i>stinking</i> heavy, and flying it near the legs is a lot easier than near the middle, due to lengths of truss, loading points, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve never tried it personally, but people who&#x27;s ears I trust all say that besides all of that, just using a secondary sound system for vocals still makes them come through a lot clearer and everything sound better.<p>One possible reason for that is that a speaker is essentially just a paper cone with an electromagnet on it.  There are physical limits on what that one bit of paper can do in terms of vibrations.  We like to pretend the world is a lot more digital and measurable than it really is.  By separating out the vocals from the other instruments, you allow the speakers to <i>only</i> move when the vocalist is singing.  I can see why it could be cleaner.  I believe the Chilli Peppers may be doing 2 PAs at the moment splitting off the vocals to their own mix...<p>You&#x27;ll still always need a good sound guy, and you&#x27;ll still need somehow to control the (vocals:instruments) ratio in the audience.<p>Ideally, bands would think of the sound guy as a member of the band.  Kind of like the conductor of an orchestra is a vital member of the orchestra.  A good sound guy is very similar.  A bad sound guy has all of the same control, but none of the feeling.",1436188788

2. The stakes are higher for the other eurogroup countries than they are for Greece, he can say no to any deal that doesn’t give at least some breathing room. In that position, you should play hard, which is what he did. He is a rare case of a finance minister who did his job.<p>Most finance ministers in the eurogroup who decide on the fate of the second biggest monetary union are not economists, and don’t seem to listen to the advice of economists, most of whom are calling for an end to austerity. Since the current pro-austerity administration took office, the Netherlands has performed worse than its mostly ungoverned neighbour Belgium in almost every respect, including debt-to-GDP growth. Mind you that the Netherlands is one of the richest countries in the world with financial assets worth several times its debts, and those assets have much higher returns than what they pay in interest on their loans. Yet even in this most luxurious of positions, the Dutch finance minister who is also the eurogroup president, swears by austerity for his country and for others, and the Greeks must suffer through it.",1436188328

Saying &quot;I went to a store&quot; implies that I had a wide choice of stores.  Saying &quot;I went to the store&quot; implies that I didn&#x27;t choose which store I went to.  It&#x27;s the store that I usually go to when I buy things.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the listener knows which store I went to, or that there is only one store.<p>Conversely, if I say, &quot;I ate the peach&quot; then I am inferring that there was something special about the peach which would imply that you should know about it.  Why is it different from a store?  Because I don&#x27;t routinely eat the same peach every day/week.  I don&#x27;t have a default choice.<p>Yes, I taught English as a foreign language for 5 years.

This also prevents scenarios where you might end up with N different promise implementations because you&#x27;re using N libraries, each depending on a different promise module (e.g. bluebird, Q, jQuery.Deferred, AngularJS $q, etc) all of which are slightly different.<p>This also means more feature-rich implementations can just extend the native promises instead of implementing everything from scratch, though for me this pretty much spells the end of third-party promise implementations.<p>In other words, they&#x27;ve been added for the same reason as the various new helper methods: not because they add new functionality, but because they provide a reliable well-defined and consistent solution to a very common problem.",1436188141

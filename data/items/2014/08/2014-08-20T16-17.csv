If your Rails versions is too old (which can often mean only around 12 months old), there will be no security patch released -- you&#x27;ve got to upgrade to a new version to get a security patch, with all the treadmill time that entails. If there is a security patch release, it is often bundled with other changes that come with risk of regression (and often deliver on that risk).<p>I agree it&#x27;s a &quot;double edged sword&quot;/trade-off to Rails quickly evolving nature. But the pain is very real for many of us.<p>I would definitely hesitate to deliver a Rails app to a customer that did not have sufficient in-house technical expertise to maintain it. I would not have nearly the same hesitation with a PHP app or an html/javascript-static-only app, even though all of them can need security patching (although the html/js only one probably only has security holes that effect the client!).",1408553958

This is because in JavaScript, all numbers are doubles, but JITs typically try to represent them as integers where possible, because integer operations have lower latency.<p>Scheme and Common Lisp also rely on overflow checks to optimize small integers as &quot;fixnums&quot; instead of always using arbitrary precision arithmetic. Not having hardware support for overflow checks would complicate the implementation of many dynamic languages, and reduce their performance significantly.<p>Not sure what this guy was thinking. It can&#x27;t be that hard to implement some overflow flag you can branch on, I mean, adders basically produces that information for free, don&#x27;t they?

Money per se does not take care of anything.

When your whole body is in motion you instinctively flex your muscles to do things like balance, twist, bend, jump, etc. A body in motion is essentially in a more healthy alignment and supports your passive body parts (bones, blood, nerves, organs, etc).<p>When we are still and calm, our muscles relax (in general). This is basically a bad thing for our bodies because it stops the support that a lot of our body needs. For example, letting your neck sag forward or hunching over your desk over a long period of time can damage parts of the neck and spine, overdevelop your deltoids/chest and hurt your lower back.<p>When you&#x27;re doing yoga asanas, this is all exacerbated as you intentionally put your body into positions that we don&#x27;t naturally move into without lots of practice. So in effect, it&#x27;s significantly more dangerous to sit on a mat if you&#x27;re <i>not engaging</i> your muscles or positioning your body in the correct way to support everything.<p>Yoga is dangerous in the way that every physical activity that requires skill to perform is dangerous, with one caveat: yoga asanas are dependent on the way you personally move your body and the state it&#x27;s in. So really, it&#x27;s only dangerous for people who naturally move their bodies in a way that might promote injury. This is why learning from a teacher how exactly to get into a pose, and practicing that regularly, is so important: it removes ambiguity and improves the entire physical act to not only be safe, but also be superior to how you might naturally do something.<p>But as a practitioner, I don&#x27;t personally see how yoga is any more dangerous than skiing or wrestling. You can break an arm in wrestling, and a collarbone in skiing, if you&#x27;re not careful. Just because sitting on a mat <i>looks</i> easy doesn&#x27;t mean it is.",1408551457

At the same time architecture becomes the only way that some chips can be faster than others.<p>Though I guess I should point out that progress in chip performance isn&#x27;t the same as putting more transistors on a square millimeter.  One aspect of this is that more economical silicon processes such as TSMC&#x27;s are better at cramming more transistors into a square millimeter than Intel&#x27;s, but Intel&#x27;s transistors tend to have better drive current - all at a given process node.

Seems much more likely that it&#x27;s a case of contamination - this plankton lives in the belly of shrimps and other seafood. Shrimp are one of the ISS astronauts&#x27; favorite foods. All it takes is one astronaut not washing his hands after eating and before putting on his gloves to cause contamination. If the bacteria are alive, this is definitely the basis for an interesting study re: extremophiles. But the &quot;uplifting air currents&quot; statement is just speculation at this point.",1408550794

When someone comes here and posts an Ask HN about how to find a cofounder, people frequently mention how it&#x27;s important to actually have a working relationship with the person you&#x27;re starting a company with. A common piece of advice is to just start working on a side project with someone and see where it goes. CoFoundersLab profiles (and to a certain extent my interactions with people on the site) seems to focus on &quot;here&#x27;s what my background is, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m willing to invest, this is the industry I want to go in&quot;. It&#x27;s less about &quot;I have this idea, if anyone with background X thinks this is cool and wants to help me out, feel free to get in touch&quot;.

8202895,comment,8201544,8202707,3,0,vidarh,,,"We are looking at 50+ bits <i>today</i> if you want to mmap the largest off the shelf files you&#x27;ll be able to store on <i>local disk</i> on some of the servers available even from the average system integrator. 47-48bits of <i>physical RAM</i> for shared-memory setups from companies like SGI, possibly more.<p>And it&#x27;s not that big a leap: 15 years ago, I worked mostly on systems with <1GB RAM, and where to get a decent performance 1TB+ disk array, we were looking at a fridge sized monstrosity. Today, my laptop has more than that. Even my phone is closing in: 1GB RAM + 64GB storage (even some mid range Chinese phones today advertise support for 256GB SD cards, so it is already obsolete)<p>15 years before that again - 1985 - my machine had 64KB of RAM and 176KB floppies. A couple of years later I finally got 1MB of RAM and a 20MB HD.<p>So I don&#x27;t consider it unreasonable to assume that we&#x27;ll have systems in the 1PB RAM range and 1000+ PB storage range by 2030. That&#x27;s about 50 bits for physical memory alone, or more like 60 bits to memory map that much secondary storage.<p>That&#x27;s assuming no shared memory eating address space for example.<p>For most people, it will not be that relevant for a few more years, just like it took several years from 32bit became an issue on servers until it mattered for home computers, and like how 32 bit is first now becoming an issue for mobile.<p>But think about that for a second: We don&#x27;t <i>need</i> 64 bit for our mobile phones. We do nothing on them we couldn&#x27;t find ways to shoehorn into a 32bit address space for decades to come. But going to 64bit is <i>convenient</i>. It lets us shove 8GB or 16GB RAM or more into future systems and not have to think so much about memory efficiency. So we&#x27;re going there.<p>Thus the idea that &quot;humanity will never need more than 64 bits&quot; I think is pretty much ridiculous, because it puts things on its head: It&#x27;s not that we will &quot;need&quot; it, but that we will easily find ways of making use of it if we can. E.g. direct addressing all your storage is convenient in all kinds of ways. Storing all your home videos uncompressed, unedited, in 8K resolutions, in 3D, at a higher frame rate, becomes convenient when there&#x27;s enough storage. Being able to write apps that can mmap multi PB monstrosity video projects instead of worrying about disk buffering becomes convenient when it&#x27;s possible to do it.<p>It&#x27;s not that long since I used to consider databases of a few hundred MB big. Now I throw around multi GB databases on a daily basis, and I know they are <i>small</i> for a lot of people, who deal with individual databases in the TB or PB size without blinking.",1408550476

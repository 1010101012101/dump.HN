You adopted an extreme position which is not analogous to the discussion you wished to have, and that is not an act of rhetoric; discussion as an art and a skill. It is simply poor communication - as evidenced by how widely your claims would imply you to be misunderstood.<p>Rhetorical license doesn&#x27;t cover that. The charity of understanding others extend a speaker is not an unlimited effort.<p>> I&#x27;d like to shift towards the &quot;less Evil/more privacy&quot;, but no one here or anywhere wants to try to come up with ways to do that, because everyone just assumes privacy gives Evil room to grow.<p>It does. You gave such an example yourself: TOR and child pornography. More widely speaking, it&#x27;s possible to lessen the &#x27;evil&#x27; in society through a great many means - better school, better welfare provision, stronger community links. More to the point many, even on this site, seem in favour of taking those steps: Strong encryption? Please. Better schools? Yes please. Better community organisations? Yeah. There are of course people who&#x27;d say no, but that does not change the fact that people in favour of them are easily found.<p>Many of the steps that could be taken in that regard seem orthogonal to the larger discussion at hand, (encryption security - as structured by reasonable context,) mind.",1452211109

10861816,comment,10858771,10861358,0,0,xyzzy4,,,"Ultimately, what matters the most is the price and what other investors do. The price is affected by investors&#x27; perceptions of political and social pressures. If there are new political or social pressures, then they would affect the price (over seconds to months) which would then change the indicators. The indicators wouldn&#x27;t pinpoint what those pressures are, and they would only change after the fact, but they would still change. I wouldn&#x27;t want to predict the influence of those kinds of pressures unless I could get quantitative data and back-test it, which I don&#x27;t think is possible.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect strategy by any means. But I think using indicators is superior to a buy and hold strategy. When you invest you are necessarily choosing between different strategies. There is nothing magical about buy and hold other than that it&#x27;s simple, and a lot of people do it. Historical data shows that if you trade based on indicators then your returns are much higher. I think it&#x27;s important to find what works the best through calibration and back-testing.<p>There are also risks such as survivorship bias that even applies to indicators, in addition to companies and economies. The best indicators survive in whatever system you use, and that doesn&#x27;t guarantee they will actually work well in the future. Still I think it&#x27;s better than the buy and hold strategy.",1452210999

10861814,comment,10854629,10859210,0,0,meowface,,,"I understand your point, and acknowledge that TLS MitM is a <i>major</i> security threat, but my point is that if you&#x27;re able to get deep enough into someone&#x27;s network that you&#x27;re able to intercept traffic between where it is passed to the interceptor and then re-encrypted, most information they could get from a MitM could also be obtained by pillaging the network through direct endpoint and server access. If they install malware on your workstation, they&#x27;ll grab your admin panel and email credentials with ease; they don&#x27;t need a MitM to do it.<p>You&#x27;re right that a TLS MitM is one big way to make it easier for them to pivot and install malware, but there are many other ways they can do it, too, if they&#x27;re on your internal network.<p>I think the pros of TLS interception outweigh the cons. You are exposing yourself to a little more risk once someone has already breached you, but you could say the same about other security products and procedures. For example, if you gained admin access to an endpoint agent like Carbon Black or Google Rapid Response, you can now deploy malware to every machine in the company. The pros of these endpoint monitoring tools outweigh the cons, though. You just have to architecture and protect them properly.",1452210956

Many (most?) streaming sites don&#x27;t provide fine-grained control over what quality is delivered to your device. Seems like a lot still just differentiate between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;HD&quot;. So it seems to me like T-Mobile is trying to help their limited customers out by lowering the bandwidth on videos so that data is used up a slower rate. I personally have an unlimited data plan, so I can&#x27;t even provide anecdotal evidence, but if I had a limited plan, I think I would appreciate that.<p>Once bitrate management is in place, throttling doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal. As long as I am still being delivered data at a rate > the rate at which I am consuming the video (i.e. as long as there is no buffering) then there isn&#x27;t really a problem, right?<p>If you disagree with T-Mobile&#x27;s decision to choose what bitrate is good for you, then yeah, I understand, this sucks. If, on the other hand, you are OK with this, then I don&#x27;t really think there is an issue.<p>What I think would be the best option would be for T-Mobile to have some sort of control panel that customers could use to pick a bitrate cap for all videos that they watch on their mobile plan.

I agree with both EFF and T-mobile.

Price is independent of value, and does not require the ability to sell.<p>Suppose the government made a law saying that you cannot never sell KO (Coca-Cola stock).  Today KO is selling for $41.62/sh.  Tomorrow, is it worthless?  No.  It pays a 3.05% dividend, which it typically increases 10% a year.  It is worth at least $1.27 (the first year&#x27;s dividend).<p>Now to the question about cats selling for $500k.  Would a sensible taxing authority or professional auditing firm assess a flower at $500k - $1 million?  In 1637 a single Viceroy tulip bulb sold for 3000 - 4500 florins; a skilled craftsman made 300 florins/yr [1].  Assuming that a skilled craftsman would make at least $50k/yr (probably more, given that $50k is near the median US income), one tulip bulb cost $500k - $1 million.  Not so different from selling cats for $500k, so you cannot attack the example for unreasonable prices (s/(dog|cat)/tulip bulb/).  Now, was it worth that price?  No, hence why it fell back to a much more reasonable level shortly afterwards.  But during the mania, selling one tulip in exchange for two lesser-valued tulips would be quite valid.<p>You missed the point of the illustration, which was that price (market cap) has no relationship with value.

Who wouldn&#x27;t hire a software engineer who was skilled regardless of their disability, right?<p>But it&#x27;s a little more tricky than that. Or so it seems, as I&#x27;m a blind software engineer.<p>Some quick background...I&#x27;ve been working as a software engineer for ten years now. I&#x27;m blind in my right eye and only have central vision in my left eye. I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa when I was 16, I&#x27;m now 33.<p>It hasn&#x27;t been easy to find work as a software engineer. I started noticing a trend a few years ago. As my sight got worse, the fewer job interviews resulted in a hire. Prior to this trend I was very good at job interviews, for a while I got a job offer for every one I interviewed for. So when it started to become more difficult to turn a job interview into a job I started to get a bit self-conscious. For a while I tried to hide my blindness from the interviewer -- the fake it until you make it approach. Which didn&#x27;t work very well to say the least. Then I would only bring up my blindness in person, so at least if they gave me a chance I could prove myself. But even that is starting to wear thin.<p>I now find myself looking for work again. And it&#x27;s as daunting as ever. So I&#x27;m here looking for advice. Are there any blind engineers out there that have found a way to break through the stigma? If you&#x27;re in a position to hire software engineers/developers, what would you expect from a candidate who happens to be blind? What would help or hurt their chances?<p>Thanks in advance.",1452208909

10861563,comment,10860386,10860386,0,0,kohsuke,,,"I just went to Tsukiji on the opening day of this new year. As the article states, this is the last year of the 70+ year history of the Tsukiji market.<p>If you can read it, this document <<a href=""http://www.shijou.metro.tokyo.jp/pdf/book/book_all.pdf>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shijou.metro.tokyo.jp/pdf/book/book_all.pdf></a> by the city government, who owns the market, covers the context, motivations, and efforts that had gone into the migration of the fish market from Tsukiji to Toyosu.<p>I was originally skeptical why it couldn&#x27;t be re-developed in its current site. After all, many more ambitious redevelopment projects have been successfully done in Tokyo. For example, Shibuya station, which is used by more than two million people every day, has been going through a major redevelopment. The same with freeways in Boston aka &quot;Big Dig.&quot; Granted, these projects take long time and is a major annoyance, nonetheless it proves that massive redevelopment projects are possible.<p>The document I mentioned earlier gives a nice short overview of why it is not so for Tsukiji. The main arguments are:<p>* Redevelopment needs a temporary on-site space but Tsukiji is so overcrowded at this point that this is not possible<p>* Unlike users of train stations, users of Tsukiji (food, fish, trucks, and cars) aren&#x27;t very compatible with multi story buildings, yet the site is too small to have a flat single story building, which is why they feel the need to move in the first place.<p>* The government wants to build a closed walled building for the new market. In contrast, today the market has just the roof and no walls, and it&#x27;s indeed not very clean (at least for the Japanese standard.)<p>In reference to the soil contamination problem mentioned in the economist article, the government apparently replaced the top 15 feet worth of soil for 40ha, which had cost whopping half a billion dollars (!)<p>I&#x27;d be curious to read a similar comprehensive argument from those who oppose the migration.",1452208529

We really don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s some branch of physics that allows FTL travel, or if it&#x27;s possible for intelligent beings to exist in multiple or parallel dimensions, etc.  Everything we discuss along these lines is nothing more than wild-ass speculation.<p>One problem I have with your assertion about the ready availability of FTL technology is that I think that assumption relies on the assumption that ETs have similar lifespans as us, which is probably a faulty assumption.  A race advanced enough for interstellar travel could very well have totally different biology that doesn&#x27;t age, or they might have technologically defeated aging, which is something we&#x27;re already working on ourselves even though we&#x27;ve only sent a handful of people beyond our Van Allen belts.  A species that doesn&#x27;t age, or has lifespans of millennia, might not think it&#x27;s that big a deal to send a ship to a nearby star system on a journey that&#x27;ll take a dozen or so years (in ship-time due to relativistic dilation; centuries in planet-time).  By the time they get back, their friends might be a bit older, but it&#x27;d be like us taking a trip and coming back 5 years later.  And don&#x27;t forget the possibility of &quot;suspended animation&quot;.  With sufficiently powerful engines able to achieve a sufficiently high fraction of <i>c</i>, a trip of a dozen or so light-years won&#x27;t take that long in ship-time.  It&#x27;ll even be something we&#x27;ll want to do with our lifespans.<p>Discovering our existence shouldn&#x27;t be that hard.  There&#x27;s hundreds of stars within a few dozen lightyears or so, so an advanced civilization should be able to build a powerful robotic ship to tour them all and gather data.  A few millennia or so later, it&#x27;ll return and they can analyze it, and our existence will be pretty obvious just by scanning the EM range (assuming they came within the last century), or by detecting atmospheric oxygen and photosynthesis.  Of course this assumes they&#x27;re looking for that kind of life, just like we&#x27;re doing now with our exoplanet searches.<p>Honestly, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to detect other civilizations from a reasonable distance; we&#x27;re already detecting various exoplanets, and as I said, we don&#x27;t even have any serious spaceflight capability; we&#x27;re doing it all with ground-based and some orbital telescopes.  We&#x27;re having problems seeing planets the size of our own, but better technology should change that eventually.  If we had the ability to send a ship to tour the nearby stars and send data back, advanced civilizations should be fairly obvious to a ship inside their system, just by orbiting the likely-looking planets (inside the &quot;habitable zone&quot;) and taking pictures, scanning EM frequencies, etc.  It would take a while to get data back though since the ship would take decades or centuries to get there.",1452207968

His response, in full:<p>“When I said I felt like I wild animal overhearing hunters, I didn’t mean I felt afraid or persecuted or anything like that. I just meant it was strange constantly reading pundits saying that we ought to get rid of something and thinking “the thing they want to get rid of is what I create.”<p>It’s certainly true that being rich and/or powerful means you’re ipso facto suspect to some people. Though to be fair also ipso facto credible to other people. It polarizes people. Frankly I’d prefer to do without both. I’d rather just have whatever I write judged for whether it’s true or false and not who wrote it.<p>But there’s nothing I can do about this. I’m not going to stop writing just because I know anything I say will be attacked. (Literally anything; the hardest of the hard core haters even attacked that essay I wrote about Jessica.)

10861513,comment,10857859,10861427,0,0,anarazel,,,"> On EXPLAIN, if you&#x27;ve passed my example PLANS=3 it would first do the plan in its usual way, and then try optimizing several more times, with some chance of randomly making suboptimal decisions at various decision points. It would keep doing this until it either had enough plans or else was making essentially random decisions and still couldn&#x27;t find more.<p>You&#x27;d not get anything useful by doing that. If you really consider this as a dynamic programming problem, at which place in the &#x27;pyramid&#x27; of steps would you choose the worse plan? To quote the source:<p><pre><code>        /*\n	 * We employ a simple &quot;dynamic programming&quot; algorithm: we first find all\n	 * ways to build joins of two jointree items, then all ways to build joins\n	 * of three items (from two-item joins and single items), then four-item\n	 * joins, and so on until we have considered all ways to join all the\n	 * items into one rel.\n	 *\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;d just make some random &#x27;bad&#x27; decisions, you&#x27;ll not have a significant likelihood of finding actually useful good plans.<p>> As for the PLAN command, I do not see the problem. I can look at the query and the EXPLAIN output, and I can figure out exactly how and where that query&#x27;s conditions are being incorporated. You might need extra output from EXPLAIN to make it always possible to do in an automated way, but it should be possible.<p>Good luck. Besides generating all possible plans postgres knows to generate, you very quickly essentially run into something equivalent to the halting problem.<p>> Put another way, you propose that the database has a way to look at the query and a plan stored in the table and figure out how to execute that plan for that query.<p>What I&#x27;m proposing is matching on the parse tree of the user supplied query. For each query there&#x27;s <i>exactly one</i> parsetree the postgres parser will generate. We have a way (for the awesome pg_stat_statements module) of building a &#x27;hash&#x27; of that parse tree, and thus can build a fairly efficient mapping of parsetrees to additional data.  In contrast to that, for plans you can have a humongous number of plans for each user supplied query.<p>> What would that table contain that couldn&#x27;t be represented as a chunk of text supplied with a PLAN command?<p>It would contain a, less ambiguous, version of the user supplied query. Now you could argue that you could add that to the PLAN command for matching purposes - but then we&#x27;d need guarantee that you could supply arbitrarily corrupt plan trees to postgres, without being able to cause harm. Something that&#x27;d cause significant slowdown during execution.<p>EDIT: Formatting",1452207929

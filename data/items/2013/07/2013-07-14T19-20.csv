It&#x27;s therefore also their responsibility to make sure a service can be started/stopped and have its status checked.<p>It <i>does not matter</i> what kind of init system a distro has. A single Linux distribution is an Operating System independent of all others. There is no one true portable Linux way, much less for non-Linux-based Operating Systems. You have to treat them all as separate because to do otherwise would not only add complexity to a monolithic &quot;portability&quot; system, it would eventually get so complex you&#x27;d have to split it up anyway.<p>Portable software makes 3rd-party software developers&#x27; lives easier. But the init system is not managed by 3rd-party developers. It is managed by the OS maintainers. So it does not matter what method they use.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s fucking Debian, the second-oldest distribution still in release. The oldest (Slackware) holds onto the old ways for as long as technically possible, and they&#x27;re still going strong. So why the hell they care about being &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;remaining relevant&quot; is anyone&#x27;s guess.<p>(disclaimer: I wrote my own init system for my own Linux distribution, and have modified most others)",1373831883

Those folks returned to their communities as true believers and encouraged their flock to get on the train. 15 years later that investment paid off more than any of them could have hoped.<p>That said, I suspect that there are many founders who would be open to taking the show on the road.

6041938,comment,6041830,6041830,3,0,mindcrime,,,"Good question.  I&#x27;ve been struggling with that a bit lately as well.  I mean, I enjoy what I&#x27; doing and I think we&#x27;re building some cool stuff, but when I look around and think about problems like &quot;lack of clean water&quot; and &quot;prevalent infectious disease&quot;, and &quot;hunger / lack of food&quot; and &quot;homelessness&quot;, etc. in various parts of the world, I sometimes feel a pang of doubt and sort of a &quot;shouldn&#x27;t I be doing something more important?&quot; moment.<p>So how do I stay sane? Well... a couple of ways.  For one, as a very pro-capitalist Libertarian type, I have a strong belief in entrepreneurship and small business as a way of improving the standard of living for people.  And I believe that democratizing access to powerful software tools (via creating Open Source products) ultimately has second-order (or 3rd-order, whatever) effects of promoting business and economic growth.  I look to the day when a small coffee farm in Africa or South America may use our products (for free, even) to help build their business.<p>But looking beyond even that, something dawned on me recently.  When Douglas Engelbart passed away recently, all of the stories about his death prompted me to go back and read more of his writings (and some of his peers) and I sort of re-discovered something I used to think about a lot, but had forgotten:  The idea of &quot;intelligence augmentation&quot;[1] and the implication that computers <i>should</i> serve to make us effectively smarter, both individually and collectively, and should enable us to come up with better (and faster) answers to hard  problems... things like &quot;lack of fresh water&quot; and &quot;lack of food&quot;, etc.<p>When I first started my professional programming career, I thought about things in those terms a lot (even if I didn&#x27;t know the exact phrase &quot;Intelligence Augmentation&quot;), but I have drifted away from that mindset over the years. But now I think that was a mistake, and I&#x27;m trying to rediscover how to focus on building technology that has the effect of &quot;making us smarter so we can solve hard problems&quot;.<p>So, in the case of Fogbeam Labs specifically, we were already going down the path of developing / researching / building / promoting stuff around the Semantic Web vision, we were just coming at it from a fairly simplistic &quot;how can we make money by helping customers with this stuff?&quot; mindset.  Now I&#x27;m pushing to adopt more of a &quot;will promoting this kind of technology make the world better for everybody, and, if not, what will?&quot; mindset.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_augmentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_augmentation</a>",1373830840

6041925,comment,6040828,6041068,2,0,ekidd,,,"This is a good point, but only if your attacker has access to cpu_state somehow. To do this, they would need to do one of the following:<p>1) Run code directly on the secure machine. Personally, I normally assume that if an attacker can run code, it&#x27;s already Game Over. This includes running Java bytecodes and supplying data to media codecs, all of which can potentially be escalated to running code, and then further escalated to root.<p>2) Gain external access to cpu_state without running code, perhaps via a back-doored network card that colludes with the CPU. This would be pretty impressive, but it would also require some degree of network access. You can protect against this by sticking your whole computer behind a serial line and writing an extremely simple custom protocol in Go. This would make perfect sense for a credit card vault, for example.<p>3) Run a really exotic attack, such as the ones described in <i>Reflections on Trusting Trust</i>. For example, if the chip is willing to pattern-match on certain instruction sequences in the Linux kernel and replace them with compromised microcode, then we&#x27;re in trouble. But if Intel ever got caught doing something this blatant, it would be a first-rate PR nightmare.<p>The nasty thing about a bugged hardware RNG is that it could silently compromise most of your encryption even if you had amazing perimeter security.

Why did Elop have to &quot;choose&quot; Windows?  Did Samsung have to choose between Android or Windows?  Did HTC have to choose between Android or Windows?<p>They did not.  Samsung sells both Windows and Android smartphones.  The Android phones have sold spectacularly, the Windows phones have not.  HTC sells both Android and Windows phones.  HTC&#x27;s Windows phones do not sell.  HTC&#x27;s Android phones sell well enough to keep them in the game - their profits are not spectacular, but they&#x27;re doing better than RIM and other companies.

Way in the back is a Blackberry kiosk.  Next to it is a Windows kiosk with the HTC Windows phone, the Samsung Windows phone, and - depending on the carrier - the Nokia Windows phone.  This is what Nokia is crowing about?<p>Maybe this type of talk might fool non-technical stock buyers who do not know any better.  All of us know that Nokia could have made both Android and Windows phones, just as Samsung and HTC (and other companies) do.  So we realize that his invention of the idea that they were forced to choose one or the other is nonsense.  It&#x27;s too late for Nokia to come in and be a big player in the Android market now, but it was not when way back when he sent his &quot;burning platform&quot; memo out.<p>Of course, some with perhaps more knowledge than me might say that Nokia was in bad financial shape and needed Microsoft to bail them out financially or they&#x27;d go under, and they were forced to go Windows only in that sense.  That may also be true, but again, it has no relation to the bogus reasons he says he had to make a &quot;choice&quot; in the article.

Nerds might be comfortable with these mechanisms, but nerds know how the mechanisms work.  Most users do not.<p>1. Certificates might still be a great fit for _internal use_ within an organization.<p>The idea of &quot;chain of trust&quot; is fine in theory.  In the real world, you see it everywhere.  People trust middlemen all the time.  From movie reviews to background checks.  We routinely build trust of a certain person indirectly through others.<p>But I think people are good enough at building their own systems of trust.  And they may not all follow the same steps to arrive at trust.  Maybe they prefer one middleman in the chain, or maybe they don&#x27;t mind several of them, or maybe they prefer to cut out the middlemen and go directly to the source.  And maybe they don&#x27;t agree on the same middlemen.  IMO, no one should be forced into using a system where they must accept a predermined chain of &quot;trustworthy&quot; parties, whether in the real world or in the world of computers.<p>For some reason (maybe because OpenSSL is a mix of too many things at once?), people seem to have a difficult time getting their head around the SSL PKI system.  &quot;Certificates&quot; are anything but user friendly (even if you are technically minded).

(I&#x27;ll bet the NSA&#x27;s collection of stolen private certificates is a beauty.)<p>You can&#x27;t even _compile_ OpenSSL without Perl.  What does that suggest about the authors&#x27; threshhold for complexity?  Maybe nothing.  But to me it signals that simplification is not a top priority.  OpenSSL is a complex conglomeration of software from disparate sources; considering the trust we place in it, maybe that&#x27;s relevant.  Anyway...<p>Contrast the hassle of certificates with the concept of authentication in SSH, specifically the &quot;known_hosts&quot; file.  Not perfect, but much simpler, IMO.  You keep a unique string of characters called a &quot;host key&quot; in a file on your computer.  When someone wants to connect to your computer, they can verify it&#x27;s really your computer by checking the computer on the other end for the presence of that unique string.  If it&#x27;s there, they know it&#x27;s you.<p>Bob met Alice and gave her a card with her host key printed on it.  Bob goes home and copies Alice&#x27;s host key into his &quot;known_hosts&quot; file.  If she runs an SSH daemon, Bob can now use an SSH client to identify Alice&#x27;s computer on a network.<p>We might call this &quot;SSH authentication.&quot;<p>SSH allows the use of SSL style certifcates as well.  But my understanding is they are rarely used.  My guess is because to the users, they&#x27;re not needed: SSH authenication is good enough for users.<p>The concept is sufficiently simple and the system is sufficiently manageable in practice.  IMO.",1373828983

It&#x27;s not his job to entertain you.

You falling asleep is your problem, not his.<p>Everything you say sounds plausible, but a recent paper[0] shows that two teachers delivering identical material, one in an organized and engaging manner, the other disorganized and unengaging, received exactly the evaluations you&#x27;d expect, but their styles resulted in exactly the opposite.<p>In particular, lecturer A was engaging and organized, and got excellent evaluations.  Lecturer B was disorganized and unengaging.  And yet in subsequent courses it was the students of lecturer B who went on to get the higher grades.<p>Thinking someone is an excellent lecturer is not the same as being taught effectively.<p>[0] HN submission[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6041803"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6041803</a><p>[1] Direct link: <a href=""http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/scarrell/profqual2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/scarrell/profqual2.pdf</a>",1373828706

9843843,comment,9843373,9843497,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"First of all, No, a protocol or application is not fundamentally centralized because it uses IP. IP already supports multiple forms of addressing and routing and both centralized and decentralized services use IP.<p>Second, snow does not change whether an application is centralized or not. It&#x27;s the application which is centralized, not the address. Your host&#x27;s address can be &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; or &quot;abcdefghijklmnop&quot;, this does not change how the application works at all.<p>Third, snow is just a tunnel. Any tunnel would &quot;fix&quot; an application the same way by simply translating addresses and encapsulating communication.<p>This is basically just onion routing, but snow doesn&#x27;t really exist to be an onion router. The real purpose of snow appears to be that the author wanted to use the features of IPv6 (secure connections and the ability to address and connect to a host behind a network firewall) without having to actually use IPv6 in his application, and doing all this on top of an IPv6-only network. This is what sets it apart from every other NAT-tunnel. The public key stuff is a red herring.",1436248761

There seem to be hundreds of accidents like this [1] annually where large trucks smash into cars stopped at red lights or that have slowed down during traffic jams.<p>Perhaps the cars should constantly be planning escape routes while slowing down and stopping with appropriate distance from those in front of it to allow for escape should it detect an inevitable collision from behind.  Even where the only possible escape route involves hitting another car, it should be able to make the decision that a light collision with a vehicle in another lane is perferable to a large truck hitting it at 70mph.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wtsp.com/story/news/traffic/2015/04/12/fatal-crash-pasco-county/25670699/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wtsp.com/story/news/traffic/2015/04/12/fatal-cras...</a>",1436248398

Everything was simply vendor-supported hardware and software.<p>In this case it was Novell hardware back when Novell ran on your PC and there was no such thing as a dedicated Novell server. Those came after the hardware I&#x27;m talking about.<p>The software was a point of sale system (the name of which I no longer remember) and had to be network aware.  From memory it was so the software could push transactions to another PC.<p>Anyway when the sales guy approached me and asked if we could sell the system I said no. The vendors had made it clear that the mix of network card and software didn&#x27;t work and wasn&#x27;t supported.  We learned the hard way when another customer (the guy&#x27;s brother) started having problems when we expanded his network.<p>It turned out the network vendor (Gateway?) had upreved their cards and the new ones caused reboots when used with this point of sale software.  We had to call the distributor and beg for some older version cards to make the brother&#x27;s system stable.<p>So the sales guy hears this explanation and goes to the boss and asks for permission to sell the systems since &quot;We can just request old cards.&quot; Boss asks me, I say no because we can&#x27;t guarantee getting old cards and as stated everyone in my support chain have washed their hands of this combination.<p>But the customer is price sensitive, it works for his brother and he&#x27;s saying sell me this or no sale.  So the sales guy writes a quote anyway.  He knows my boss will feel obligated to honor the quote, and he did, so we sold the system.<p>In the end the store owner was screwed by his investment partners but that&#x27;s a story for another day.<p>Hopefully you understand now why I thought the  sales guy should pay for the replacement.",1436247960

9843810,comment,9843539,9843789,0,0,Swizec,,,"> Consider another problem the vehicle already solves. The AV wisely yields to those running a red light, even though the AV has the right of way. If it didn&#x27;t, but was instead frequently t-boned... Google could technically still say its vehicle &quot;never caused an accident,&quot; right? It&#x27;d never be at fault for these, but the AVs are still designed to avoid them anyway. Is this inconsistent with a choice not to avoid rear end collisions at intersections?<p>This is called defensive driving. You as a human are supposed to avoid getting killed even in cases where you aren&#x27;t legally liable. This includes making sure the intersection is clear before going in. It includes checking if anyone is coming down the wrong way of a one way street before going in or crossing it. It involves something as simple as making sure &quot;right lane must turn&quot; actually turned before someone magically appears out of your blind spot.<p>And, importantly, it also includes knowing what&#x27;s behind you as much as knowing what&#x27;s in front of you. If you see someone is going to rear-end you, you should at the very least step off the brake to make the collision less violent. If possible accelerate forward.<p>And I know this isn&#x27;t possible [/practical] in most american cars because they&#x27;re automatics, but don&#x27;t hold the brake when you&#x27;re standing still. It makes potential rear-endings work out better. And never turn the wheel before you intend to turn. If you get rear-ended you could get pushed into oncoming traffic.<p>All this is to say that while only one vehicle is to blame for a collision, two vehicles are responsible. (unless you hit a tree or some other static barrier, a tree cannot drive defensively)<p>Or, more bluntly, it might be the other person&#x27;s fault, but you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s dead.",1436247851

These &quot;harbinger&quot; consumers are only harbingers if, collectively, they make up a disproportionately large percentage of sales.<p>Another way to think about it is that what you really should care about is not the number of sales, but instead the the number of sales to people who have similar purchasing patterns to the typical consumer you hope to reach.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that the authors are arguing that sometimes having a lot of early sales is actually worse than having only a few. It&#x27;s a problem if that large number of sales includes a disproportionately high percentage of &quot;flop affinity&quot; consumers.  It would be better to have a small number of sales, but also with low percentage of high &quot;flop affinity&quot; consumers. The intuition behind this is perhaps that in order to reach so many of a relatively rare consumer type - the harbinger of failure consumer - you must have also reached a lot of the more typical consumers, and they decided your product isn&#x27;t appealing to them. On the other hand if you have low sales, but only a small percentage of these sales is to harbinger consumers then presumably your product is appealing to mainstream consumers, and your sales problem can be fixed with relatively straightforward marketing and distribution tactics.<p>Maybe the tl;dr could basically just be: not all early sales are the same, so understand who your buyers are and how representative their purchasing habits actually are of the market you&#x27;re trying to reach.",1436246486

Without having done both, I&#x27;d tend to agree with you: a blog is a blog.<p>The opportunity cost from system migration (and re-invention) is non-trivial. But so are the opportunities gained with a new infrastructure. The speed gains from serving static files is nice, but to me, they are no where near the kind of gains I make by being able to work with plain text files.<p>When I want to write a file, I pop open my (probably already open) text editor, bang it out, save, switch to Terminal, push to S3. Did I make a typo? OK, fix the typo, save, re-run the Terminal command. Maybe I want to push a few posts, but I want to make sure they all look right...OK, run the jekyll server and look at localhost. Then run the push command. Oh wait, maybe one of those posts should be a draft. OK, set it to draft in the metadata, re-push, etc. etc.<p>I have a particularly bad experience with WordPress because I&#x27;ve been running my blog on it for five years on the cheapest Dreamhost shared server. However, I&#x27;ve spent a good amount of time researching and installing WordPress plugins to do caching...but the problem is that every goddamnned database action, including setting a post from draft to publish, or vice versa, is a 5 to 50 second process.<p>Obviously, Stack Exchange doesn&#x27;t suffer under that kind of hosting issue. And they could probably set up their WordPress on a local instance so that it can be locally browsed (in my experience, this can be <i>profoundly difficult</i>, and quite the weekend project). But no matter what their hosting infrastructure is, it still doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that every posting action requires a database -- everything from creating users, setting user roles, setting post status, and of course, editing the post.<p>Sure, you have to learn those things in Jekyll too...but the conventions are easy...and most importantly, you can do them within the confines of your text editor. That means everyone who contributes to the blog, engineers and marketers, <i>gets better at their text editor</i> (and operating system). This is a much more worthwhile skill than getting better at WordPress...which is a non-trivial skill...WordPress, to its credit, is fast moving in its development...for occasional publishers like me, this means I spent a good amount of cognitive energy re-learning the interface. With Jekyll, even as the software changes, I just have to learn my text editor. And that&#x27;s just wonderful, considering how much of my work involves a text editor.<p>For non-techies, I imagine it&#x27;s a little daunting at first...but they&#x27;re fully-functioning adults. They can handle plain text. And working with Jekyll not only makes it easier for the engineers to do the occasional hacking of templates, it allows the non-techies to actually _see_ it without having to jump through the many plugin submenus in the WordPress admin. It is literally a Cmd-T (in Sublime Text) to look up a file. Or, a Find All across a project...which is another <i>huge benefit</i>...blog contributors often need to look up past material...the text editor search is far superior to what can be done in the WP Admin or other web search interfaces.<p>So it&#x27;s not that &quot;WordPress is not cool&quot;...and the fact that you think that one solution is to &quot;just fix WordPress&quot; makes me think you don&#x27;t understand the problem. WordPress doesn&#x27;t need to be &quot;fixed&quot; to be more like Jekyll, it is a fundamentally different product, with certain tradeoffs and benefits worth pursing. To say that the OP should&#x27;ve &quot;just fixed WordPress&quot; is like saying, &quot;Why use Facebook? Just get better at using the CC: field in email&quot;",1436245474

A simple checkout involves accessing 100s if not 1000s of objects. Also, you can&#x27;t fetch these all at once because the objects you need to fetch are determined based on a nested tree. So you have to query the tree all the way down, getting each nested tree or blob based on the previous tree&#x27;s contents. So ultimately you&#x27;re doing 100s-1000s of queries for any given git command. Each query is fast, but even at 1-2 ms per query it adds up quickly.&quot;<p>So the question is, what sort of data store would be extremely fast and scalable for storing git?  A graph database? A key/value store?  Seems a little odd that the plain old file system is the fastest option.",1436245361

Yeah, &quot;changing two lines in the nginx configuration&quot; could have worked, but imho simply the cost of keeping in your head the information about what two lines to change is just too large.

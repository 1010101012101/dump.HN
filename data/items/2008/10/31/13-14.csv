Sure is handy when you don't want to burn a CD you know you are going to use less than 5 times :-). Plus it boots fast, unlike the sluggish livecd's. You can make your choice from about a two dozen distro's including LinuxMint (which I intend to try very soon), Fedora, Puppy, DamnSmallLinux and other great ones.",1225461311

Sendmail X, the same, isn't in widespread use at all yet (I'm not 100% certain it's even out).<p>The worm (as worms do) exploited vulnerabilities, which means it wasn't exactly intended to have the consent of the people whose machines were exploited.<p>Also, unverified from Wikipedia - ""The worm was released from MIT to disguise the fact that the worm originally came from Cornell."" Which seems to indicate that Morris indeed knew what he was doing would incure someone's ire.<p>Though I do agree the worm, like so many telnet password sniffing attempts later on, raised awareness of security.",1225461151

Presenting your customers with a Mom and Pop shack even when you're a Wal*Mart isn't a bad thing.  It helps them feel bigger if you seem small.<p>As far as B2B, I haven't seen any negative responses there either, perhaps because we don't deal with many middle-management MBA-types.

The most notable is 32bit video codecs and flash. Interestingly, you can play Homeworld 2 and Warcraft III fine in Wine even on 64 bit.<p>The primary is problem is not that we progressed to 64 bit.

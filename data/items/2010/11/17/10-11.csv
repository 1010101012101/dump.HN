Over the weekend I setup my router to do TCP proxying, and I noticed that a lot of sites do not emit valid TCP streams (making them inaccessible to machines behind the router).  Metafilter, in particular, emits a valid stream if the page is not cached (like submitting an article), but it's hit or miss if the page is cached.<p>Presumably this is because the load balancer hijacks the raw TCP connection, but is not smart enough to use valid sequence numbers:<p><a href=""http://readlist.com/lists/openbsd.org/misc/9/45511.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readlist.com/lists/openbsd.org/misc/9/45511.html</a><p>The side effect of the Internet violating the TCP standard is that TCP becomes a lot less resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks.  And, my firewall has to deal with various strange things, like packets in the middle of a TCP stream that have a TTL such that they don't get routed, but do affect the firewall's state table.  But hey, at least your load balancer doesn't have to establish <i>two</i> TCP connections!  Imagine the latency that would introduce!",1289991266

To do what most people do with mathematica, however, (and the way most people use mathematica is more like the way they use an interpreter than the way they write in a source file, by trying out all sorts of combinations of some little pieces while they work out the actual problem they're trying to solve in their heads) it seems like a good idea, as you're just removing friction from the system (what if circle.make_smaller() was named circle.reduce_size()?

But the US banking industry is much more complicated than any other country - much less Sweden's (with all due respect).<p>If the banks had not been bailed out by TARP they could have been nationalized cheaply, restructured and relaunched. The equity holders would have been wiped out, as they should have been since their banks were broke, and the employees at these banks would not have extracted even more obscene amounts of money. By now you'd have functional banks driving the economy again.

It is as if you are forming your own group and sitting at a different table for lunch at school. What if every country sat on their own table? It is just going to result in unnecessary fragmentation.<p>Now, I understand that you are not moving away from HN and have created the site to discuss Indian specific issues, but I don't see what is stopping you from discussing those issues on HN itself. The site being an exact HN clone doesn't sit well with your good intentions. Add to that the fact that you are using the same name.<p>Sorry for generalizing, but IMHO, the global image of Indian hackers is not particularly good, and this sort of thing doesn't help.

16475,comment,16409,16436,0,0,paul,,,"Yeah, solid-state storage is clearly the future for most apps. Flash is over 10x cheaper than DRAM though, so it'd be nice to see some high-performance flash drives as well. It's also nice to not have to worry about losing data during a prolonged power outage.",1177458190

His life is his work - no romance, no home.  Does he ever take a vacation?<p>He focuses on purpose to explain his lifestyle, and has clearly achieved incredible success at his business.  But what about forging intimate personal relationships, both romantic and with friends?  <p>I get such great value from having close relationships, a ""home"", an ""office"" that to imagine life without them is almost impossible.  Of course he has 30+ year relationships with his clients, so maybe he has developed close friendships with some of them.<p>If Rand had created him as a character, maybe the purpose would be to show the downside of total focus on only business.  Life without romance - never!",1177457701

If users are performing some activity once every 30 sec, then you will be pretty much be at your limit with about 5000 simultaneous users.<p>Robert, did you test MySQL with a parallel load? To give it the best chance at maximizing tps, it will need to be able to combine multiple pending transactions in a single write. Also, can you tell if it's updating it's b-trees? (if not, it may not be able to sustain these rates)",1177457654

But the only two people who's cell habits I happen to know, are very often guilty of snail dialing.  I don't understand it, but I'd guess that this is a real use case for a lot of people.",1177456696

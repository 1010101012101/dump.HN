It's great and all that you have 10 people to vote up an article as soon as its posted... but I don't. Shouldn't the content be voted up based on its own merits vs. how many people you know? An instant 10 votes is a huge unfair advantage.<p>> if so, it's too bad, because quality content like robertjmoore's last three posts is getting lost<p>If the problem is the content getting ""lost"" because you guys are voting up the articles... <i>then stop doing that</i>. If the content is vote-worthy it will get votes.<p>Additional comment: sure, I get that this wasn't clear to you guys... but come on.

4666768,comment,4666077,4666077,21,0,numair,,,"Sometimes people will make investments that truly, really, make no sense.  In order to appear smart, and to fit in with people they want to befriend (and with whom they want to work or do deals), others will give you very long-winded explanations of why you simply don't get it, this time is different, etc.  In the end, common sense prevails.<p>Most of the ""contrarian"" bets out there weren't really contrarian at all; you simply didn't have enough information to understand what was going on.  AH's deal for Skype, for example -- you didn't have an understanding of the psychology of dealmakers at eBay or Microsoft to know what would happen (and, to be honest, I find it strange and distasteful that they are so proud of an investment in which they screwed over all of the portfolio company's employees so severely).  Investment managers, all of them, have no imagination whatsoever; a good deal is one in which you simply have a lot more information than anyone else, and are thus able to engage in high-stakes information arbitrage.<p>Sometimes investment managers forget they are just that, investment managers.  They want to be cool, they want to be the man in the ring, they want to be the creative artist.  That's where they screw up.  Phil Falcone's disastrous bet on LightSquared is an excellent example of a really smart guy shooting himself in the balls in this manner.<p>RapGenius is one of these investments.  And anyone who has been around the block longer than a couple years is fully aware of it.  Whether they are willing to piss off AH and state this publicly, however, remains to be seen.  Very few people have ever truly called out KP on Segway, or Sequoia on Color, for example.  It pays to remain quiet.<p>As for me, I'm just hoping smart young kids will stop trying to analyze this deal, and others like it, in the hopes of finding or ""discovering"" any sort of logic in what they see.  Don't waste your time.  Don't base any of your own ideas on what you see happening.  Just focus on what you're doing, and ignore all of this nonsense.  Yeah, these guys raised $15 million.  No, they aren't role models; no, their business doesn't actually make sense within the context of the deal; and no, you shouldn't try to emulate any of this crap.<p>Oh, and this article has it all wrong.  It isn't at all difficult to get close to people in the entertainment industry.  They are all watching their businesses getting disrupted by young technologists, so they have an obsession with getting to know all of the young technologists they can.  You used to collect cars or jewelry -- now you collect smart kids with startups.  I can't wait for the next big rap song that has someone bragging about how ""I got way more startups than you.""<p>Call me a hater, I don't care.  I'm just being honest.",1350514256

I cannot call them ""people"", because our users are a specific subset of people... they are people in context that matters, deeply.

It is also relevant to providers that are attacked by malcontents, black hat organizations, and less-than-egalitarian governments that are attempting to disrupt their services.<p>Whatever you think of TPB, you have to give them credit for being both nimble and technologically savvy in solving a problem of service disruption against what many would see as long odds.

All the companies that pass through HN have to deal with the problems of Uptime, especially in the case of adversarial situations that are beyond our control.<p>This particular case is interesting because the service is dealing with a well organized and deliberate attack against it as well as it's users.

They've done a great job creating an annotation system for rap lyrics, and I think that it could scale well to other genres of music and certain kinds of poetry. Their public personas may or may not hurt adoption outside of the hip-hop community, but it's too early to tell[1].<p>I think a bigger challenge will be overcoming the natural constraints of the format. If the goal is to become the Internet Talmud, they will need deeper levels of commentary. You can see the strain when you look at the Rap Genius page for Ben Horowitz's latest essay[2]. The annotations were split evenly between useful links, jokes (which were decent, admittedly), and fairly pointless ""explanations"" that just repeat what the essay said in a way that's drier and harder to understand. A better set of annotations would consist of comments from other domain experts either agreeing with Ben's conclusions and adding more evidence, or disagreeing and explaining why[3]. There could also be factual notes explaining the context (digging into the history of Opsware, for instance). But Ben's essay is written in plain language and doesn't rely on many external references, so the Spot the Allusion style of annotation doesn't really work there.<p>To take a couple of examples from poetry, Spot the Allusion goes a long way towards explaining poems like The Wasteland[4]. But how would Rap Genius go about annotating William Carlos Williams? Well, we can actually look and see. If you look at The Red Wheelbarrow[5], you can see the format breaking down. There is no one true exegesis of a line from that poem, but Rap Genius isn't built to handle the kind of commentary the poem needs.<p>I'm sure this has already crossed their minds, so I'm interested in seeing how they deal with the problem.<p>--<p>[1] For me, at least, it comes across as unnatural posturing and rubs me the wrong way. That's just my gut reaction. I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually led to a backlash within the rap community, too.<p>[2] <a href=""http://rapgenius.com/B-horowitz-making-yourself-a-ceo-lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rapgenius.com/B-horowitz-making-yourself-a-ceo-lyrics</a><p>[3] The comments wouldn't have to come from the experts themselves; amateurs could add links to things they've written and said elsewhere.<p>[4] <a href=""http://rapgenius.com/Ts-eliot-the-waste-land-lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rapgenius.com/Ts-eliot-the-waste-land-lyrics</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://rapgenius.com/William-carlos-williams-the-red-wheelbarrow-lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rapgenius.com/William-carlos-williams-the-red-wheelba...</a>",1350512161

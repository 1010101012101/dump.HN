3503394,story,,,1,0,cambriar,"Ask HN: Location based messaging service?",,"This is my first post. Does there exist a service where one can leave a message based on location? Twitter is obviously great for message passing and microblogging. Facebook and Google+ certainly help bring us together. I'd say that the combination of these two services greatly help communities all over the world exchange messages. Throughout very recent history, it was made abundantly clear that these technologies amplified many voices that needed to be heard.<p>Here is my question: Is there a service that allows for messaging based on location? Like Twitter, but with anonymity and coordinates.<p>There was a post on a 'Show HN' thread that seemed very close to implementing this idea, but didn't. That post pointed to http://rround.me. This project looks great and ended up getting quite a few people excited. However, it's not what I had in mind.<p>I've spent some time implementing this idea. After several iterations, I like my prototype. However, I know that this kind of application (if popular) would require a stronger backbone and would completely destroy my shared host. I thought this idea would be great to implement by myself so that one day I could show it off on HN, but I think that that day may be too far away. I've decided to try and lead a team for my final software engineering course to develop this idea. I wrote an article today detailing more aspects of the project as well as my concerns about sharing the idea. \nIf you want, you can read it at http://cameronbriar.blogspot.com/2012/01/sharing-original-idea.html",1327377587

3503382,comment,3500876,3500876,1,0,dkrich,,,"When I was in bschool, one of the founders of Aardvark came and gave a talk about their early days. What it boiled down to was a few super-smart guys taking EXACTLY the strategy prescribed in this article (namely getting a landing page up and manually handling the backend processes).<p>They eventually sold the company to Google for $50MM. Great for them. Where is Aardvark today?<p>I said it then and I'll say it again- experimentation is for laboratories, not for businesses. At the core of a business is a product or service that people exchange money for because it solves a problem. Too many startups set out with the mission of meeting their founders' needs (ie, quick money and fame) as opposed to any real societal needs. The irony is that if the founders worked from the consumer need backward and took a more long-term approach, their chances of success would likely go up substantially. The Lean Startup Method to me involves some mix of laziness, lack of vision, and giving up on your product and vision prematurely.<p>The faster your product proves viable, the easier it will be for competitors to rip it off anyway (Groupon, anyone?). You want real, sustained traction? Do the things that others are too lazy or unwilling to do because they are too hard or involve some risk.<p>I'm not advocating over-engineering, and it is great that development tools have progressed to the point that designers and developers can perform experiments for free while honing their skills. But to put an initial idea out there and let the public bat it around and bastardize it until it has some weird mixture of users and you don't even understand your own product is a path to nowhere. Remember- tools are merely used to complete a task. Let the task dictate the tools, and not the other way around.",1327377186

The deciding factor is whether there is an invasion of your mental privacy inherent in the government compulsion.  Whether you disclose the combination or open the lock yourself, the contents of your mind are being used to incriminate you, so your Fifth Amendment rights are being violated.  This is distinct from the government demanding the key to a safe, or even taking a blood sample from you against your will, both of which are purely physical impositions.<p>===<p>Longer Version:<p>If the police have a warrant to search your documents, that does not mean that they can make you provide the documents to them.  They can look through your stuff to find the documents, but if the police cannot read them, that is their problem.<p>However, a grand jury can subpoena documents from you, in which case you will be compelled to provide them.  In this case, you can invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against testimonial self incrimination as it relates to the production of documents.  To the extent that the act of producing the documents requires you to use the contents of your mind, the act of production cannot be used to incriminate you.  So, on one hand, your Fifth Amendment right will not protect you if the police already know that the documents exist and all of the information that is contained in them.  However, if the police do not know exactly what documents they are looking for and what the documents say, then the information found in the documents cannot be used against you in court, nor can it be used to find other incriminating information.<p>See U.S. v.

3503328,comment,3502067,3502376,2,0,droithomme,,,"> Do you really think that MegaUpload generated 175MM from a few users signing up to a paid account<p>No, I think they made money from a LOT of users signing up for paid accounts. I know lots of people that did so, Megaupload is widely used by professionals in the video, music, graphics and games industries for transferring and distributing large files at low cost legally.<p>I find it highly unlikely that those engaging in illegal activity went in and gave their traceable credit card information to get accounts for illegal activity. That may have happened, but it seems obvious that users doing illegal stuff, particularly those involving stealing things because you don't want to pay, are not highly likely to be creating easily traceable financial connections between their illegal activity and their real identities.<p>File sizes are large nowadays and millions of people and teams work remotely. There is a tremendous need for locker sites with large file capabilities, reasonable usability, and low cost. Megaupload provided a good technical solution and price to a strong need in modern business and this is why they were successful. People paid them because people have large files they need to work with and distribute. Completely separately from illegal use.<p>Any company that allows uploading of material is going to have this problem. Legislation such as DMCA was supposed to protect business from copyright violation liability when the infringement was committed by third parties as long as they followed the takedown process. Now we find that DMCA does no such thing, and businesses are beginning to shut down or drastically limit file hosting services. This is creating serious problems for tens of thousands or more of legitimate users and is harming legal businesses that benefit from locker file hosting services.",1327375822

Best practices should advocate maintainability and clarity - in this case parseFloat is the better choice for obvious reasons. Just be aware that parseFloat and unary + aren't exactly equivalent: parseFloat(""10x"") === 10, +""10x"" === NaN.<p>And no, JavaScript is not a ""non-typed language."" AFAIK JavaScript is both dynamically and weakly typed. Being in the latter category <i>does</i> mean that it will implicitly convert values to other types in certain scenarios.",1327374268

If they had a warrant for ""evidence"" and no knowledge or reason to believe that it was in the safe, could they open it/force you to open it simply because you own the safe. Similarly, if you had a hard drive, could they force decryption without knowing how the contents relate to the case.<p>Another issue that comes to mind is what happens if a hard drive containing truly random data is found, but the state thinks it contains encrypted data. Could someone be held in contempt for not releasing the (nonexistant) keys. This is probably related to the problem of destroyed keys.",1327374138

At that point it doesn't matter exactly how much they made legally or illegally.  Does it matter that a pawn shop makes some money legitimately if it's basically a front for selling stolen property?",1327374083

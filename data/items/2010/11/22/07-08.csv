So we use a similar approach in having hot spares on the bigger boxes.<p>As pointed out in the article, using distributed block storage means you need a pretty high performance storage network and low latency is just as important as high bandwidth.<p>We already have a physically separated storage network that runs in parallel to our public network. This is used primarily for drive traffic over iSCSI. We have a standard gigabit redundant network for this. As a physically separated network it means we don't get data integrity issues caused by DOS for example.<p>Moving to distributed block storage will mean we will upgrade our storage back-end to either 10Gbps Ethernet or Infiniband. The advantage of Infiniband is that as a cloud provider we will have essentially a large grid which is what Infiniband is meant for. We can also use 40Gbps per port so with dual networking can go up to 80Gbps relatively cost effectively. Just as important is the super low latency. Suffice to say we are ahead of the software on this one :-)<p>I think its important to point out that as storage moves to these sorts of systems it will be come increasing difficult to replicate such a setup in a redundant fashion on dedicated hardware. As a cloud provider we spread the cost over many customers.<p>Best wishes,<p>Patrick, CEO, CloudSigma",1290412019

1929040,comment,1927103,1928251,0,0,cloudsigma,,,"Just to come back on the point regarding NFS versus iSCSI:\n- proprietary systems like IBM's, HP etc. are both expensive and complicated. This violates our 'simple problems' mantra as well as having cost implications.\n- our IaaS platform has an open software layer with sole root access granted to the user. That has huge security and privacy implications for our users i.e. they have access to their data, we as a vendor don't (except for physical access which is highly restricted and monitored). It means we see customer drives as block storage devices. We can't see their file systems. NFS can we implemented by a customer on top of our platform but not by ourselves. We do in fact have many users of NFS in our cloud. Its our job to manage the storage at the block device level. As a vendor we are a 'pure IaaS' provider. We don't reach into the software and networking layers wherever possible. Its a fundamentally different approach giving our customers the same sort of control over their computing as they would with a dedicated set-up.\n-  DRBD has de-duplification. For a public cloud like ours this will save us a lot of space, more than the replication introduced. Why? We just RAID6 already so replication won't be higher with DRBD (we will swap RAID6 for DRBD). We have thousands of identical operating systems running concurrently with their own distinct copies (each of our cloud servers is a complete stand alone OS on its own block device, again for privacy/security reasons).<p>So, we believe that a move from our current set-up to distributed block storage will actually REDUCE costs overall no increase them. We will of course have the added convenience and elimination of single points of failure in storage that distributed block storage entails.<p>Best wishes,<p>Patrick\nCEO\nCloudSigma",1290411528

And let's say Stanford only got applications from the bottom 5%...  you see where this is going.<p>Paul Graham's evangelizing means that, regardless of the utility of Y Combinator, if he convinces the top start-up prospects to join the program, it will make the program look good.  They are looking for people who would be <i>successful even without them</i>.<p>Y Combinator could be <i>minorly</i> helpful and they would go on to success; it could be a wash, and they could go on to success; it could be a slight negative, and the strongest candidates would mostly still go onto success.<p>People could also FEEL that it's an incredible experience, even if this isn't objectively the case.  Many people join various kinds of self-help or self-empowerment groups and enjoy the events and believe in them strongly, even if there is demonstrable practical harm.<p>Y Combinator could also have a net negative effect on the startup landscape, because NOT getting in can be so disappointing that it can lead people to give up (I wrote that before your post, but the link expired; I reloaded, and made this a reply instead of top-level comment); in other cases, they've found people who applied and got in, who considered <i>getting in</i> to be the accomplishment. Paul's viewpoints have been increasingly dominating the national conversation on startups the last few years, so the hypothetical indictments are meant to address its success as propaganda.  Obviously if it really WERE the best approach, criticizing it for being too successful <i>in its results</i> would be disingenuous.<p>There's also a huge emphasis on getting funded being an accomplishment, which is a big distraction from the real priority for a business, which is making something that makes a profit.  (A nice big funding round also means now you need an even BIGGER exit.  This can actually reduce your chances for personal success.  Xobni couldn't sell to Microsoft for $20 million because it wouldn't have been a big enough ROI for its investors.  Perhaps they really thought they could be a billion dollar company and didn't want to sell anyway, but you see the point.)<p>Paul's talk about angels and super-angels and valuations focused on the main point being ""the percent chance that the start-up is Google,"" if I recall correctly.<p>To me it looks like Y Combinator has the wrong model for that.  The resources and timeframe favor much smaller ideas.  According to the unofficial YClist.com, the top exit was 280 North at $20 million, which means not only have they not had another Google, they haven't yet had another ViaWeb.<p>It would be interesting to find a list of angels and their investments for the last 5 years and see which ones had bigger deals than that.  I'm guessing a lot.  So, that covers instincts and judgment, at least so far.<p>As for changing your idea, there are market segments that have been goldmines which I have yet to see a single YC company delve into.  Thus, I'm not so sure on the advice portion.<p>There is a pretty big generation gap with the hot web properties and I don't know if any of the YC principals really grok it.<p>If PG reads this I expect to be told I'm wrong on every point except perhaps for a token concession for decorum.  It's hard to talk people out of bad ideas when they're stubborn ;)",1290410129

1928997,comment,1926515,1928886,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>So is any studying for a test acceptable, since it modifies the understanding you had before studying?</i><p>That's the whole freakin' point:  the test is supposed to measure your understanding.  The honest way to improve your test scores is to improve your understanding of the material.  The professors administer tests, the students study and learn, this is the intended way of things.  This is the way traditional college classes work, and if you want to go to college and get grades, then you have two choices:  study and earn your grades honestly, or lie and cheat.<p>Everybody encounters a class that they end up cutting corners in, of course.  For example, you can try to predict what topics will be on the test and study those most carefully.  You can try to predict which problems will be on the test and learn to solve those.  The question is, are you actually trying to learn something the class is designed to teach and hoping that what you learn will serve you well in the test, or are you trying to improve your score without learning anything useful?  Drilling pattern recognition of potential test problems is not learning.  That method relies on your mind's ability to recognize specific verbal patterns and associate them with other verbal patterns.  It has nothing to do with understanding the material.  From the perspective of learning, it's a complete waste of time.<p>By the way, I agree with you that professors should lift questions and answers from their lecture notes with great restraint, for exactly the same reason.  One or two here and there to reward diligent attendance is fine, but if it's a significant portion of the test, then the professor is essentially conspiring with the students to inflate the test results by relying on familiar phrases or diagrams to trigger students' memories of how to answer a particular question.  That's actually a good reason for teachers to share testing materials:  will students still understand the material when their professor's particular phrasing is not present?  I heard a student complain he got a physics problem wrong because the professor always said ""inclined plane,"" but the test problem talked about a ""slanted floor.""  Clearly the student did not understand the material and was relying on verbal associations; no matter whose fault it was (the student's or the professor's) it was good that the test result reflected the student's lack of understanding.  In the real world, an inclined plane does not say to you, ""Hi there, I'm an 'inclined plane.'  Does that ring a bell?""  Or if it does, it will probably not use exactly the same words your college physics professor used in his lectures!  That's a very good reason for a professor to use problems written by someone else.",1290409915

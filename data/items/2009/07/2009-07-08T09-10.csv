Today I'd likely opt for local talent via referrals or craigslist. I'm not sure if it's because my budgets and needs are different today or whether it's because of my experiences on elance TBH.<p>Overall my experience was mixed - terrible all the way to excellent. I think there is a learning curve and I would suggest starting with as small of a project as you can first so that you can see how it works. I made many mistakes but by far my worst mistakes were made when I created a single post for multi-step tasks. Had I broken each of those into smaller components, I would've been able to control the quality (and budget) better.",1247046585

However, for a company like Apple that has built a business that requires selling media content and supporting hardware acceleration in mobile devices, it’s not possible to randomly drop a codec technology when a submarine patent threat appears.

7342648,comment,7341625,7342341,6,0,britta,,,"From a week ago, a proof of concept of this kind of bug, &quot;Background Monitoring on Non-Jailbroken iOS 7 Devices&quot;: <a href=""http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/2014/02/background-monitoring-on-non-jailbroken-ios-7-devices-and-a-mitigation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/2014/02/background-mon...</a><p>> iOS7 provides settings for &quot;background app refresh&quot;. Disabling unnecessary app&#x27;s background refreshing contributes to preventing the potential background monitoring. However, it can be bypassed. For example, an app can play music in the background without turning on its &quot;background app refresh&quot; switch. Thus a malicious app can disguise itself as a music app to conduct background monitoring.",1393963196
7342647,comment,7304059,7310055,1,0,jeanyang,,,"A language exists on its own, with its own syntax and semantics. It may interoperate with other languages, but it usually takes some work to get a language written in one language to talk to a language executing in another language. (Examples include C/OCaml and all the languages that execute on the .NET runtime.)<p>An embedded domain-specific language is a language with its own semantics that has been grafted onto another language. For instance, Jeeves is embedded in Python. We can use Jeeves as a Python library, but when we&#x27;re using Jeeves functions, the program behave like Jeeves programs rather than vanilla Python programs. (In this case, it means that the runtime tracks different possible views of sensitive values and computations done on them.) When programmers use the @jeeves decorator and the Jeeves API, the programs look like Python programs and can even use Python built-in functions and libraries, but the Jeeves library is doing work behind the scenes to make the programs behave differently.",1393963194

Grammar needs to be able to shift away from English in-line while maintaining semantic clarity, and sometimes that means the reader needs to distinguish between graphemes without any of the typical contextual cues that classic written languages provide.<p>The most common issue is hand-copying a piece of text between devices, such as a cryptocurrency address or a URL. Sure, it would be great if those sorts of non-linguistic bits of information were always tagged appropriately such that they show up in a different font, but that rarely happens in reality. Even here, on Hacker News, we can only talk in plaintext with a few minor markup features.<p>A general-purpose web font should be able to handle a variety of linguistic and non-linguistic strings and not choke up on edge cases.

Get to know the folks who sit around you, and eat with them.  Try to meet folks in other departments as well.  Your network will probably be your single biggest asset in trying to navigate Google&#x27;s often byzantine project structure.<p>2. Your starter project will probably be pretty boring.  Suck it up and do a bang-up job on it.  Starter projects are usually a way for your team to get a sense of what you can do.  If you establish a reputation as someone who gets shit done early on, good projects will come your way.<p>3. Stay away from - well, I can&#x27;t exactly say in a public forum, but basically any mailing list or internal app where you get long centithreads or pictures of cats.  Corp G+, however, is pretty useful for getting plugged in to what the general zeitgeist at the company is - what concerns the rank & file employees have, what projects people are excited about, interesting new infrastructure that&#x27;s available, teams you may want to join.<p>4. 20% time is a great tool for getting to know a potential team and letting them get to know you, and a terrible tool for starting something new.  When you first start, you should probably be heads-down on your main project, and dive in there.  But once you&#x27;ve got a chance to see some of the other interesting projects in the company, don&#x27;t be afraid to 20% there and transfer if you like the experience.<p>5. Find and attach yourself to a good manager, do good work for him, and ride the coattails of shared success.  Managers vary wildly in quality at Google.  Experienced engineers (those with >1 year of experience in a department) all know who the good ones are.  If you get a bad manager you will stagnate, find your projects are continually ripped out from under you, and come up short at promo time.  If you get a good manager your career will be one success after another, and eventually you&#x27;ll get a reputation as the &quot;go to&quot; guy in a domain.  That&#x27;s when you get your pick of high-profile projects.",1393962544

7342550,comment,7335194,7342248,1,0,001sky,,,"Lets actually look at a more realistic example. Women in CS and Engineering today might be ~10-20pct of FTEs. That means, in a medium sized shop, where there might be 20-30 engineers, you have a situation whee how many are women? 2-6? That sounds about right. Now, if you are in this position...the issue is that the guys have 18-24 FTEs amongst their co-hort. In order for the girls to get the same type of network-density you need to bring together the equivalent of 5 to 10x shops together. That is just simpe seeding of network effects. If you worked in a shop with only 2 or 3 other people who did your job, the &quot;law of small numbers&quot; means your chances of leveraging this social infrastructure are &quot;hit or miss&quot;. There are too many simple variables (personality type, work habits, social background, etc) for an effective &quot;matching problem&quot; to be solved. Or use another example: would you go to a school with only 2 or 3 students in your major? Most people would see that as a red-flag. Social isolation is at odds with the type of network effects most people seek to develop at school. MBAs for example typically invest $250k to buy a commodity education, paired with a very exclusive rolodex. The value of this degree would almost be worthless in a school with 3 other students (regardless of the teaching).<p>This is quite a different argument from lowering standards or affirmative action or whatever you want to call it.  In fact, it is precisely the strategy YC used to bring its co-horts together. Back in 2005, VCs did not back many founders without an advanced degree (MA/PhD or MBA). As a result, it made sense to bring together (concentrate) a cohort, because the general peer group of VC backed CEO&#x27;s would not have much in common with a 22 year old with no job experience. By bringing folks together that face similar challenges, you are not (per-se) giving these people special treatment or lowering standards; you&#x27;re just providing a level os support infractructure that lets them &quot;self-help&quot; there way through many problems. It is actually critical that you don&#x27;t &quot;dumb down&quot; standards, for this to work.",1393962311

One of the things that keeps young women with children in the work force is that family medical coverage has become relatively scarce. Most women who have small children feel conflicted about working and wish the could either work only part time or be home with their child. They work in part to retain medical coverage.<p>Homemakers and dependent children (who can be young adults -- like college students) are technically &quot;unemployed&quot; but are not simply cut off from societal resources.

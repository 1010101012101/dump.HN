62675,comment,62630,62630,0,0,jkush,,,"I think this is a good idea. Have you considered tracking which sites are most commonly allowed and then providing that list as a default for new users? I can imagine it being quite a pain to allow access one site at a time. If there were a ""community accepted"" list of sites, that might be a cool feature.<p>Our of curiosity, how many downloads so far?",1191434153

I know of at least one family member who will find this very useful!<p>Some suggestions I have are:<p>I like the web site design, I think it conveys the simple ""child-friendly"" look. However, the colors are stark and a bit bold, slightly desaturating/lightening them might be a more pleasing to the eye.<p>A family member of mine is having a hard time keeping their young daughter from accessing stuff she shouldn't be seeing on the internet. The problem is this little girl is quite a hacker, and has found very clever ways of circumventing the protections, even going to the extent to sneak onto her moms computer to get the passwords to disable the controls. I'm not familiar with the details of your protection schemes, but I guess my advice is dont assume kids, just because they are young, cant crack your stuff! Kids are much more computer-savvy these days so make sure all of your bases are covered.<p>Good luck on your YC appliation. This idea is refreshingly new and I like it. ",1191433872

62669,comment,62630,62630,0,0,danteembermage,,,"I'm really trying to contain myself because I'm going to get silly bubbly effusive. I can't help it, this product is a dream come true. For dramatic effect I'm going to post the greasemonkey script I adapted to try to do this for my kids in firefox, seriously I am going to get on the horn and let everyone with school age kids I know about the browser.<p>Some things that I think would be really useful: You've got that toolbar on the left side that's always there. For poorly designed sites (disney.go.com is the one I tried) they force a side scroll bar so you can't see the whole page left to right at once. I understand there's a big trade-off here; if that toolbar hides they may not know how to bring it back, but they may not know how to use the left to right scroll bar either. It would be nice to have a appear if moused over option, or perhaps check if the website is not resizing appropriately and shrink the toolbar for those sites.<p>Another thing I would think would be nice is to be able to filter content within sites. So perhaps pushing CTRL + f12 creates a ban on that particular directory within a white-listed site. In our family that means kongregate.com is okay but kongregate.com/zombie_rampage not so much. That would address the wikipedia concern as well. Perhaps you might even trace sub-directories other users have banned and apply them to your child's browsing if you enable it.<p>In any case the firefox icons are getting deleted from the desktop and start menu right now and pikluk is now the new default browser for at least three people in this family.<p>Oh, and as promised:<p><pre><code> // Invisibility Cloak\n // version 0.1\n // Gina Trapani\n // 2006-01-03\n // Released to the public domain.\n //\n // ==UserScript==\n // @name          Invisibility Cloak\n // @description   Turns time-wasting web pages invisible until a specified time of day.\n // @include       http://flickr.com/*\n // @include       http://*.flickr.com/*\n // @include       http://metafilter.com/*\n // @include       http://*.metafilter.com/*\n // @include       http://www.kongregate.com/games/SeanCooper/boxhead-2play-rooms/*\n // ==/UserScript==\n //\n // ==RevisionHistory==\n // Version 0.1:\n // Released: 2006-01-03.\n // Initial release.\n // ==/RevisionHistory==\n \n \n \n (function () {\n 	// EDIT THE NEXT LINE TO SET THE HOUR AFTER WHICH SITES SHOULD APPEAR\n 	// HOURS IN MILITARY TIME, SO 15 = 3PM\n 	var surf_time_after = 23;\n 	// END EDIT\n \n 	var readable_time = '';\n 	if (surf_time_after > 12 )\n 	{\n 		readable_time = surf_time_after - 12;\n 		readable_time = readable_time + 'PM';\n 	} else {\n 		readable_time = surf_time_after + 'AM';\n 	}\n \n 	var tstamp = new Date();\n \n 	if (1<2 | tstamp.getHours() < surf_time_after )\n 	{\n 		var b = (document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0]);\n 		b.setAttribute('style', 'display:none!important');\n 		alert(""This game or site has been deemed shady by the parents!"");\n 	}\n \n })();\n</code></pre>",1191433295

62660,comment,62519,62519,0,0,geebee,,,"I'm really glad to see that people are coming around to this school of thought.  It seems very closely related to the decline of waterfall and the rise of iterative development.<p>It's really important that we (the people who believe in prototyping and iterative development) emphasize that this is not a chaotic way to approach a problem.  We absolutely do plan - however, we plan by coding and prototyping, rather than writing detailed specs.  Specs are good - but they emerge from the code and the prototype.  We absolutely do consider design issues - however, we discover and implement these things through refactoring.  And in the end, we may very well throw out our first approach and rewrite, if it appears to be necessary.<p>But I think this is leaving the realm of opinion and entering the realm of reality. The people who try to do the pure waterfall where an architect designs and writes specs, a coder writes code, a tester does testing - they seem to be losing badly in the race to get excellent software to market.  From what I've read (successful startups, Google) the free market appears to be rewarding the better approach.   ",1191432122

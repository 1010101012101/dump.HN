For example, if your goal is to lose 10 pounds, you will spend every moment until you reach the goal—if you reach it at all—feeling as if you were short of your goal. In other words, goal-oriented people exist in a state of nearly continuous failure that they hope will be temporary.<p>If you achieve your goal, you celebrate and feel terrific, but only until you realize that you just lost the thing that gave you purpose and direction. Your options are to feel empty and useless, perhaps enjoying the spoils of your success until they bore you, or to set new goals and re-enter the cycle of permanent presuccess failure.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve always been taught that there are 3 people in the world:<p>1) People who live in the past<p>2) People who have a dream and stop having dreams when they achieve that dream<p>3) People who have dreams and set new dreams once they achieve their current dream<p>Opens up the eyes based on another person&#x27;s perspective.

6551380,comment,6548893,6550514,11,0,dlitz,,,"Oh, cool!  Have you considered making changes to the interface that&#x27;s presented to userspace?  As a crypto library author, I have a few gripes about the current interface:<p>1. The distinction between /dev/random and /dev/urandom is silly.  On a machine that&#x27;s been been collecting entropy for weeks, /dev/random will still block after reading a few bytes.  On the other hand, on an embedded device that&#x27;s just left the factory, /dev/urandom will happily return &quot;random&quot; bytes that aren&#x27;t.  The result is that /dev/random is unusable for anyone except cipherpunks, and /dev/urandom is unsafe on embedded devices.<p>2. /dev/urandom is slow, so libraries (including mine) all end up shipping their own PRNG implementations in userspace, where they&#x27;re susceptible to threading issues, having their entire state duplicated by fork(), &quot;//MD_Update(&m,buf,j)&quot;, etc.  It&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to do this correctly in a user-space library, and I bet the NSA and others are having a lot of fun at the expense of our users.<p>What I&#x27;d like is a single, fast, trustworthy /dev/?random device that is good enough to obsolete user-space PRNGs entirely.  This means it would have the following properties:<p>1. It blocks until the kernel decides that it can safely generate cryptographically-strong random bytes (i.e. first boot), and never blocks again unless something extraordinary happens (i.e. it&#x27;s a VM guest that&#x27;s just been cloned, or something).  The idea would be that it never produces output that isn&#x27;t cryptographically strong, but is otherwise reliable enough that applications can behave as if it never blocks.<p>2. It produces output so quickly that userspace programs never have an excuse to use anything else.  i.e. Its speed should be comparable to what you get using AES-NI in counter mode (I know you don&#x27;t like Fortuna&#x27;s entropy pooling, but its output-side PRNG is exactly what you&#x27;d want here.)  Ideally, this could be fast enough that developers wouldn&#x27;t even need to distinguish between &quot;random numbers&quot; and &quot;cryptographically-strong random numbers&quot;---just use it everywhere, even if you might otherwise use Mersenne Twister.<p>TL;DR - I want a faster, reliable, trust-inspiring /dev/?random that obsoletes all user-space CSPRNGs and possibly all user-space PRNGs.<p>I&#x27;ve been tempted to write something like this myself, but from my casual reading of the lkml archives, it hasn&#x27;t been clear whether you were actually interested in RNG patches like this.

Everything seems so hostile. For example:<p><pre><code>  restrict: &#x27;E&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nGood luck knowing what that does at first glance. Instead why couldn&#x27;t it have been simply called:<p><pre><code>  type: &#x27;element&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nOr another one, surely the default for creating new custom elements would be to always replace the element, so we shouldn&#x27;t have to manually set:<p><pre><code>  replace: true\n</code></pre>\nBut we do because not all directives default to replacement, so maybe they thought it would get confusing if some defaulted to it. Instead they probably should have realized that the problem wasn&#x27;t with the default for replacement, it was that everything was shoe-horned into a &quot;directive&quot;. Why not have an easy shortcut for create elements vs. creating events or attributes...<p><pre><code>  app.element(&#x27;button&#x27;, ...\n\n  app.attribute(&#x27;toggle&#x27;, ...\n\n  app.event(&#x27;scroll&#x27;, ...\n</code></pre>\nAnd then you can have sensible defaults for each one without the user getting extremely confused. I would absolutely expect elements to replace by default.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is an oversimplification, but surely there have to be less implementor-hostile ways to write these features. For example, even after reading the article I still have no idea what setting this on an attribute does:<p><pre><code>  scope: {\n    toggle: &#x27;=&#x27;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s ridiculous.

I didn&#x27;t use that term and neither did the author of the original post. It&#x27;s a perfectly valid English construction; whether the term it describes is something that&#x27;s particularly relevant is another question.<p><pre><code>  No, it&#x27;s a statement of fact. The US Marines is a \n  male space. Oops, am I a bad little misogynist now?\n</code></pre>\nThere are women in the Marines, and many of them have served and died in the line of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. So not only is that not a statement of fact, it&#x27;s also quite insulting to those women who have put their life on the line for this country.<p>Now, it&#x27;s true that as of now in the US, women have not been put directly into combat roles. Combat battalions are still exclusively male spaces. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t mean that women haven&#x27;t been involved in combat; sometimes they have by accident, or in many cases they have through loopholes or trial programs like the Marine Corps Lioness&#x27;s program.<p>Stating that the programming profession is male dominated is a statement of fact. Stating that people are trying to &quot;co-opt male spaces&quot; by being more inclusive of women is misogynist. Talking about co-opting male spaces implies that it&#x27;s something that men have the right to and women to not; that something is being taken away from men by making it friendlier for women to join. That implies that either women in the space are bad, or being friendlier and making them feel more comfortable is bad, either of which can accurately be described as misogynist.<p><pre><code>  Yes, it is. If it&#x27;s invalid, then by all means \n  invalidate it for me.\n</code></pre>\nThought police must be, well, police. Even if you want to speak metaphorically, they must be someone with some kind of coercive power to apply rules that are designed to shape how people think.<p>The original author was simply pointing out some examples of bad behavior, and saying &quot;hey, this doesn&#x27;t make you cool, it makes you an asshole&quot;. He mused about whether RubyGems should ban them, but then said this was unrealistic.<p>On the other hand, Aaron Ashworth threatened to and then did ban him from the Ruby Facebook group. So if you&#x27;re looking for &quot;thought police&quot;, that qualifies more than criticizing some people for childish names.<p>So, I&#x27;ve invalidated the point. Will you now admit that the point was not valid, and that the nasty behavior (accusing women of making it &quot;all about their vaginas&quot;) was simply nasty behavior for the sake of being nasty, and not because there was a valid point?<p>And don&#x27;t try to tell me something along the lines of &quot;well, maybe he didn&#x27;t have a valid point about this particular post, but it is a real problem.&quot; If you want to discuss real problem, you should discuss real problems, not lash about about vaginas and thought police.<p><pre><code>  I don&#x27;t hang out with Rubyists. I don&#x27;t care about Ruby. \n  It&#x27;s a bad language, for a start.\n</code></pre>\nSure, let&#x27;s forget about Ruby for the moment.<p><pre><code>  In the general programming field there are plenty of \n  people spending lots of time trying to boost the status \n  of women and institute PC memes. Do you deny this?\n</code></pre>\nThere are some people spending lots of time trying to boost the status of women, yes. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say &quot;lots of people&quot; relative to the size of the community. Most people mind their own business and don&#x27;t really act one way or another. Some people act aggressively negatively. Some people act more dismissively negatively.<p>I have no idea what you mean by &quot;institute PC memes&quot;. The phrase &quot;PC&quot; is thrown around to refer to so many things, and tar so many thing with whatever bad reputation that it&#x27;s supposed to have, that I&#x27;m never really sure what people mean when they say it any more.<p>Some people try to institute policies to make male-dominated spaces more friendly to women. Some people try to use social means, of speaking up about what they find to be unacceptable behavior. Some focus on encouraging and mentoring women.<p>But none of these are about making anything &quot;all about their vagina&quot;. That&#x27;s a ridiculous reactionary overstatement. The original post wasn&#x27;t about anyone&#x27;s vagina, it was about wanting to take the focus off of things like that and put it onto more constructive things.<p>Making this argument is like making the argument that any time you bring up some men&#x27;s issue, it&#x27;s &quot;all about your dick.&quot; No, actually. Both women and men are a lot more complex than just their most distinctive sex-linked anatomical features. But saying that is a great way to dismiss any concerns that there might be some kind of sexist behavior going on, because obviously if you complain about sexist behavior you must want to make everything be about your vagina, right?",1381807347

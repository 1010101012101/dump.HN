9692678,comment,9691002,9691002,0,0,TheCapn,,,"Not to knock on the industry at large but the day I gave up wanting to program &quot;services&quot; (for the lack of a better term -- things that work the data to produce an outcome that although convenient, is not a necessity of our lives) and apply my skills to tangible, real world problems I became immensely happier in my day to day. I went from loathing the next day of work and counting the clock hours until I ran out the door to happily thinking of the problems, looking forward to the next project. I think a lot of people in software could benefit from taking the time to take a hands-on hobby of sorts where you create physical output, a useful craft with purpose. There&#x27;s a chunk of our lives that logic and algorithms cannot fulfill in the same way that a craft can.<p>It seems like hokum re-reading that last paragraph. I wish  I was better with words to portray what I&#x27;m trying to get across but its just something that&#x27;s been on my mind in the last month or so. I feel into another slump similar to what our article&#x27;s author describes. You get caught in a cycle of &quot;I&#x27;m tired because tomorrow will suck&quot; and don&#x27;t use that time to regenerate and recover. When my car hit the tipping point last week and I was forced to get my hands dirty it broke that cycle. I came out from under with a true sense of accomplishment; beaming with pride for what I had done and suddenly Monday&#x27;s problems were on the wayside.<p>To swing back to what I tried saying originally though; having a job where I produce factories, networks, systems that clients look, touch, and interact with just gives the same feeling of pride that I never achieved when building services for IPTV products, billing software features or other data applications. I&#x27;m certain there&#x27;s a whole host of people that drool at some of those domains but if that&#x27;s not your &quot;thing&quot; then you&#x27;ll never be happy. I wasn&#x27;t, the author likely wasn&#x27;t but that&#x27;s not to say she can&#x27;t find happiness anywhere in tech. And to believe that leaving it all behind for a mystery won&#x27;t solve those same problems that put her where she is now. &quot;The Grass is Always Greener&quot; will wane and she&#x27;ll miss being among peers and those who she can share her problems with. A girlfriend in the medical industry just can&#x27;t converse on the same level as other tech&#x27;s can, its where I reach out to coworkers, peers, friends to blow off some steam. I wish her the best, I just hope she figures out where the true problems lie or where her true calling is before she regrets distancing herself from an industry that she has obvious passion for.",1433948341

Instead I will list the reasons why burnout could have happened to him.<p>Point 1 &quot;unless X has a toxic work culture,it&#x27;s likely the author brought it on themselves by pushing too hard.&quot;<p>An overstatement unless you know what he faced. You were hired for your problem-solving ability where pushing hard can be expected at times. In reality this could be he&#x27;s not pushing too hard so much as the existing environment which leeches effort and adds burden to every step. Toxic culture is somewhat unlikely but what if he inherited a huge technical debt, this happens a lot.<p>Point 2 it&#x27;s a terrible feeling to have to spend your most productive hours working on someone else&#x27;s problems. He or she may find themselves drawn toward entrepreneurship<p>Wrong. IMO you can either work as a product engineer role building something new (hopefully) or as support role integrating products/fixing glaring bugs crappy code/migrating systems. The latter is not exciting. A developer MUST be capable of both and SHOULD be given at least an opportunity for both. It does not have to be in your own startup. I maybe a coder but I am not a horseshit shoveler.<p>Point 3 Office culture is draining. Some people aren&#x27;t cut out for it.<p>Why ? It doesn&#x27;t have to be. Even then why assume work culture is the culprit here and he is not cut for it.<p>Point 4 Additionally, programmers tend to push themselves too hard for too long out of a misplaced sense of loyalty to the company. They don&#x27;t see that the work they do is extremely valuable in and of itself.<p>Translation the coder has to see the fine line of enthusiasm between &quot;working already&quot; and overzealous. Seems like a hypothetical problem unless you tell why is it relevant here. About the &quot;work&quot; you say, you should tell what &quot;work&quot; is. It is not just the stationary lines of code lying on repository, but the amount of effort that went to write it, debug it and will go to maintain it. A badly written project demands higher effort to keep it running than what you could imagine.<p>Point 5 a coder doesn&#x27;t owe the company anything more than their agreed-upon hours of work.<p>I know that is the agreement. But I don’t know if you have seen places where boss wants work in a deadline and not hours a coder spends and wants it done. You should remind him that then.",1433948330

The animators started adding hair on the arms of the characters as an obvious thing the directors could latch onto and demand the artists modify.

Creative people are distracted very easily [0] and the open office layout was really destroying my love for being an engineer. It was very funny because when I&#x27;d come home I&#x27;d be exhausted, but if I sat and tried to do my homework I&#x27;d actually get more done when I was exhausted because there weren&#x27;t 100 people walking around me.<p>2. The office has a window. I hated working in this cramped, open, shared space we had for a while. The closest window was probably 25 feet away in a small conference room. And there was <i>nothing</i> on the walls.<p>3. This new position that I haven&#x27;t quite accepted yet gives me the opportunity to write one day a week to create entries for a technical blog and writing is something I&#x27;d like to do anyways so the opportunity to be able to contribute to the tech community in that manner is tremendous.<p>4. This is a recruiting firm so I&#x27;ll actually hopefully get to see some people get hired because of the things I do! How neat to have a real world impact.<p>5. They do lots of charity events so I can always respect that. Lots of companies focus on the parties but parties are just a way to escape in a lot of ways, I think giving back will feel tremendous.<p>6. I&#x27;ll be helping to work out what to do next with the CEO, this could potentially be stressful, but I really love the idea of having the opportunity to develop performance indicators, plan out entire systems, and build a team. This allows me to be more than just a cog in the machine or one man on a team, it allows me to feel like a real god damn fuckin engineer. A contributor. I have so many ideas all the time, why not be employed somewhere where I&#x27;m more than just feature X, maintenence Y, and feature Z ad nauseum?<p>That being said there are a few downsides such as not being able to have a close mentor. I am still relatively junior. This means I&#x27;ll have to work a bit harder on my own in order to stay fresh and keep building my skills which means some homework time with Code Complete and other resources like that. I may ask for them to hire me a mentor every fortnight for half a day so that I may improve and to keep the quality of everything I do for them up to snuff.<p>So, while I&#x27;m a bit apprehensive about starting up again (thats a lot of weight on my shoulders!), I&#x27;m very excited to start at a place where I think I&#x27;ll really be able to have an incredibly positive impact in the environment that I really feel will have the most positive impact on my performance and well being. If I&#x27;m easily distracted by people slurping sodas, why is it that most of the choices for offices for tech workers <i>force</i> me to accept that the only acceptable place for me to do incredibly complex engineering work is near people making jokes and slurping sodas?<p>I may have taken a small pay cut (although bonuses will hopefully make up and then some if I really shine) but for me to finally have the opportunity to do engineering work in an office, and to be a part of the decision making process, and to have duties beyond just feature A and feature B including nontechnical technical writing, that excites me.<p>So I guess my advice is, maybe instead of seeking meds (although therapy on its own I&#x27;m sure might be incredibly good (I&#x27;ve not been yet (although it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if I probably should have))), maybe do some introspection and figure out exactly what it is that is draining you day after day and then try to change those.<p>For me, I think, it was an inability to get into the zone at work, thus making me spend so much of my energy just on maintaining a decent level of focus. When I&#x27;m home, I don&#x27;t need that and the time flies whenever I actually sit and do work. To get rid of that energy drain should be tremendous for me. Maybe you guys will see some tech articles by me in the future, I sure hope so ;-)<p>[0] - <a href=""http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6831248"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6831248</a>",1433947329

I&#x27;ll tell you what I do. Here&#x27;s the secret:<p><i>Put yourself first.</i><p>Now, that sounds quite selfish on first-blush. What exactly does that mean?<p>For me, it means I take care of my health, first and foremost. Before the day is started, before the family is awake, I head off to the gym to be with The Iron. Henry Rollins wrote about it much more eloquently that I can, so I urge you to take a moment and read his words [1].<p>Once you&#x27;ve been with The Iron, nothing can stop you. Sure, you will still have rough days. But, I will tell you that, having been with The Iron, you will <i>know</i> that there is nothing that can bring you down. You will <i>know</i> that you have earned it for yourself on that morning. There is very little that can shake you when you <i>know</i> that. When all else fails around you, when software fails, when management fails, when fear, doubt, uncertainty and self-pity come rumbling toward you like a freight train, when friends forsake you... I am here to tell you that you will gently remind yourself in the midst of the storm:<p><i>&quot;I rolled out of the rack to bring it. When most of the world around me was asleep, I paid the price [2], and that is what truly matters today.&quot;</i><p>And, over time, you will build that attitude, and you will find that you are unshakable. You will find that you will manage your time to make it happen. You will find that, even while you work hard at work, you will not let it control you. The work will always be there; the inbox will always be full, so put yourself first.<p>You will find that you will start eating right, because you realize that there is a price to be paid in order to stave off feelings that certain foods can cause. The roller-coaster of junk food and caffeine will fade from your life, because you will find that they have a net-negative impact regarding how you want to feel and perform. You may even find that you want to start meditating, to balance the mind.<p>I know it&#x27;s old advice. I know that it sounds cliche. But I urge you to try it. Do it for yourself. If you can&#x27;t do mornings, then do it when you can. Mornings just set the tone for me, but do what works for you.<p><i>Take time to put yourself first, every day.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oldtimestrongman.com/strength-articles/iron-henry-rollins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oldtimestrongman.com/strength-articles/iron-henry...</a><p>[2] I&#x27;m very fond of Vince Lombardi&#x27;s words here:<p>Football is a great deal like life in that it teaches that work, sacrifice, perseverance, competitive drive, selflessness and respect for authority is the price that each and every one of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile.<p>To achieve success, whatever the job we have, we must pay a price.<p>Success is like anything worthwhile. It has a price. You have to pay the price to win and you have to pay the price to get to the point where success is possible. Most important, you must pay the price to stay there. Once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success, it enables you to ignore the minor hurts, the opponent&#x27;s pressure, and the temporary failures.<p>I&#x27;ve never known a man worth his salt who, in the long run, deep down in his heart, didn&#x27;t appreciate the grind, the discipline.<p>A man can be as great as he wants to be.

Ruby or Python? Go or C++? Haskell or Common Lisp? You can accomplish the same things in either tool. Which you like better has a lot to do with what you already know. And popularity may seem like a shallow measure, but it affects whether you can get questions answered, find blog posts and books, locate a library to do something for you, and hire developers who already know the technology.<p>Popularity is <i>probably</i> also weakly correlated with stability.

I always thought of myself as &quot;liberal&quot; when I lived in Europe. However, moving to the US I found myself often times very annoyed by people not obeying common everyday conventions. A dumb example would be people jaywalking right in front of your car, being fully aware that you have to stop because of their jaywalking. When I visited Japan I realized that I actually appreciate fascism to a certain degree, which is a shocking thing to realize. Having a strong shared set of conventions and shared values that help enforce these conventions make everyday life so much more pleasant. When I use light rail in SF, I am constantly strategizing where to position myself relative to other passengers, so that I can get on the train early in order to get a seat. In Japan there are markings on the floor where you have to stand and no one would dare to skip the line. These are small examples of things that make everyday life just so much more pleasant.

Then the hypervisor swaps that RAM or puts it out of play in another way, and gets to reclaim the underlying physical RAM.

That would imply beyond a certain estimated error horizon, it doesn&#x27;t really matter which year you download as long as you get the decade vaguely correct, once the temperature error figure exceeds a couple years of travel along the trend lines.<p>By example lets say today, here, 2080 CE, is 35C +/- 2C (to make the math easy) but the trend line is 0.1C/yr (unrealistic, but make the math easy) then +/- 2C is the same thing as saying +/- 20 years along the trendline, so I don&#x27;t really need the 2080 data set I can do &quot;roughly as well&quot; with any data set downloaded from 2070 to 2090.<p>Yeah yeah I know calculus and the derivative is likely not constant or even linear and this is a really simplified way to look at statistics, but the general plan holds as a way to cut back on downloaded data required.  Based on REAL statistical analysis you could come up with a formula that says you&#x27;ll only increase the error bars 10% wider at year X if you skip every Y years of data.  Where I&#x27;m guessing Y might exceed a decade at the extreme future years of the run.

I think that developer estimation only plays a minor role, and the big problem is failure to manage project scope.<p>I&#x27;m specifically talking about projects which go like this:<p>1) A set of high-level business requirements are put together, and given to a tech lead to estimate.<p>2) The tech lead&#x27;s estimate, based on the requirements as-given, is used to determine a budget for the project, and probably a schedule as well.<p>3) Once the budget and schedule are approved, the project commences.<p>4) As development begins detailed software requirements are worked out, which usually exposes holes in the high-level business requirements that need to be fleshed out as well.<p>5) The estimates are never updated, and any attempt to increase the budget due to the new requirements are seen as a sign of failure.<p>What I see happening in #4 is two kinds of scope creep. The first kind is the sort everyone is familiar with: a requirement was missed, a new feature needs to be added, and since this wasn&#x27;t in the original budget the budget needs to be increased. It&#x27;s easy to identify these new/changed requirements, easy to see the big chunk of time needed to implement them, and easy to make prioritization decisions about the new requirement vs the other original requirements, so that maybe something can be dropped in order to avoid increasing the budget.<p>But there&#x27;s a second kind of scope creep, and it&#x27;s insidious. It comes from turning high-level requirements into detailed requirements into implemented and tested code. Every decision a developer needs to make about how to implement a feature is an implicit detailed software requirement, and you just can&#x27;t know how many of those decisions will be needed or what their impacts will be until you get into the details. The time needed for these all add up, and I consider them to be scope creep because they aren&#x27;t part of the high-level requirements used for the estimate and budget. We try to add padding for them because we know they&#x27;re going to happen, but if you add sufficient padding across-the-board for all of the detailed requirement decisions that might be needed your project will never get approved. So we pad insufficiently, hoping that some of the requirements will be easier to implement than we estimate to cover the ones that aren&#x27;t, and we don&#x27;t manage this kind of scope creep at all. It&#x27;s invisible, because it&#x27;s just adding a few minutes here, a few minutes there, until our estimates have been blown away and we&#x27;re over budget and we can&#x27;t really say why.",1433945756

That would be like dismissing linked lists as involving too much work, since we have to keep pushing and popping values in and out of the lists; so why not just use individual variables?<p>Of course, in reality the whole point of lists is that we can ignore their contents and manipulate them as whole entities; mapping, slicing, merging, sorting, etc. The same applies to &quot;effect values&quot;; we don&#x27;t just declare an enum and throw a load of switch statements everywhere.

These are my reasons:<p>1) The automatic parallelization opportunities of HOFs don&#x27;t happen in practice nearly as often as you&#x27;d expect. Sorry, but it&#x27;s true. Haskell&#x27;s &quot;map&quot; doesn&#x27;t parallelize automatically.<p>2) Loops are a single construct you learn once and apply everywhere, while HOFs are a huge and bewildering zoo.<p>3) Loops can do many things that HOFs cannot. You can do break/continue/return in the loop body. You can iterate over two collections at once, skipping elements of one collection depending on what you see in the other. And so on.<p>4) Loops scale to from simple use cases to complicated ones gradually and continuously. With HOFs, when your use case changes slightly (e.g. you add a counter), you often need to go all the way up and use a different HOF.<p>5) Loops make the time and space complexity much more obvious. With HOFs, you often get nasty surprises. For example, see the tail-recursive vs non-tail-recursive implementations of &quot;map&quot; in OCaml, or the foldr vs foldl vs foldl&#x27; situation in Haskell.<p>6) Loops are much easier to understand from a machine point of view. For HOFs, you need a language with closures, and in some cases GC as well. Loops, on the other hand, can be done in C.<p>In a nutshell, loops are easier to learn, easier to read, easier to write, and easier to execute.",1433945086

In my area, watching east africans try to steal phones off tables in coffee shops is so run of the mill it&#x27;s boring.  Same nationalities, same activities - community effects.  Some places in London try to resolve such a situation by mixing up affordable housing with higher-income housing.  The situation is then exacerbated, as the higher income people then have to live with what is in their culture unpleasant behaviour.  Of course, everything just gets dismissed as racism, when it&#x27;s in fact about culture, not race, and not applicable to all cultures.  The dismissal resolves nothing.  If we were talking about moving into the amazon, people would be outraged at the displacement of the locals, but somehow western cultures don&#x27;t matter, or some sort of penance has to be paid for sins of some previous generations.

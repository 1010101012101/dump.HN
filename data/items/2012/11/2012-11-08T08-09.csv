4756989,comment,4756771,4756771,12,0,czhiddy,,,"Wall Street (among other people) has this belief that Apple products are a temporary fad. Their argument is that at some unspecified point in the future, popular sentiment will do a 180, and the company will fall off the face of the planet like they're the Crocs of the tech world. This completely ignores how the company built itself up - by making high quality products and pairing it with strong customer service. The built-up trust is similar to how you pay a little more to go to your favorite mechanic vs Jiffy Lube.<p>Incidentally, I think this was a key reason Scott Forstall was let go. His slip ups on Siri and Maps (particularly) annoyed enough customers to the point where brand loyalty was damaged. See how much Jobs stressed the importance of the brand (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugqcXqTEVMA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugqcXqTEVMA</a>).<p>This weakness is a great opportunity for other companies, but Microsoft seems to have fumbled a bit with Surface so far (judging by the reviews). Android manufacturers, as usual, release a dozen or so mediocre phones each year alongside their high quality flagship models, which doesn't do much to improve their image.

It would kick off big style and suddenly consent to include my magic ballots would be withdrawn by everybody else - the Returning Officer would make a decision and probably have a word with the polis - who are present at, and supervise the ballot boxes.<p>Protecting the integrity of the ballot is like securing a computer system. Identify the core vectors of attack and lock them down. So it is about ""what is the rate of postal votes?"" ""are the postal vote samples inline with the end-result?"" ""what is the turnout? relative to last time and other similar constituencies?"" ""what is the churn in voter registration?"" ""is the final turnout consistent with the reported turnout?"" ""is it easy to buy votes?"" ""is it easy to register fake voters?"".<p>The core point is not to make fraud hard but to make it visible. Of course the basic 'don't make it easy' steps need to be taken - but after that it is all about 'don't let anybody get away with it'.<p>The problem on HN is that nobody coming up with suggestions on how to improve the ballot is doing any 'customer discovery' - going out to talk to actual people who stand for election and run elections and who are trying to ensure that the vote is fair. The computer pixie dust being scattered around is fixing non-problems.<p>BTW it isn't an X it is a St Andrew's cross - St Andrew being the patron saint of truth telling - it means 'I swear by St Andrew that this is my true intent'. The 'kiss' on a letter likewise meaning 'I swear by St Andrew that my love is true'. One of the perks of being Scottish is that our flag stands for truth, love and democracy :)",1352364455

4756977,comment,4756590,4756590,1,0,sicxu,,,"Scalability is an architecture issue, not a programming language issue. You can certainly build linearly scalable system in Ruby. It just costs more to scale a Ruby app vs. an equivalent Java app. In the end, the tradeoff is between engineering cost and operating cost. When you spend 100k to hire an engineer and your traffic can be handled by a few boxes.  Engineering productivity is your primary focus. As your traffic grows, you need more and more servers, server efficiency becomes more and more important. At some point, the savings in server cost justifies the increased cost in engineering effort and you make a switch from Ruby to Java.",1352364252

Every government is desperate to raise money i.e. increase taxes (cf France's various recent disastrous forays in this area). So the point that Apple, Facebook, Google, Starbucks et al may have to pay higher corporate tax is a good one (and let's hope they do).<p>More importantly for AAPL though is the generational shift, I think. People in their 20s (just), 30s, 40s know about the Apple 'cool' factor but on a recent trip to SE Asia I would guess 60% or more of the teens were using non-iPhones.

I <i>need</i> the colors to match the corporate identity and can't do that if I can't paste the exact color code.

Apple's rise has partly been caused by being ahead of the curve on technology, with a blockbuster launch every 4-5 years.  iPod (storage, battery life), iPhone (touch screen, UI), iPad (touch screen).  There is no evidence of a further blockbuster launch - I am not supportive of an Apple TV.<p>Coolness has a lifespan.  People get bored.  I'm bored of the iPhone now.

(Extra effort isn't free.)</i><p>If you get to the scale of twitter, and more importantly if you have written a real time messaging server with a web application framework, it doesn't matter which framework or language you started with as you're going to be completely rewriting your entire stack at some stage as different parts fail in order to deal with the load (unless you have an incredibly experienced team who has written a twitter equivalent before and scaled it to 15000 messages a second). There's no difference between ruby or python (or perl, or php) in that regard - they are all interpreted and relatively slow, which starts to matter at this scale. And also even if you had used java or c in the fist place, if you had an architecture not written with massive scale in mind, you probably wouldn't survive that growth without radical changes on every level of your stack.<p>Re ruby versus python, the popularity of rails is partly historical accident, partly that ruby is a nice language which doesn't get in the way and is ideally suited to this domain, and partly that rails is deals with lots of the basics of web development for you without getting in the way too much when you need to adapt it. None of that means ruby is better than python, but I'd disagree that people put up with ruby in order to use rails - it's a really nice language in its own right, but it is not highly performant (though it is getting better). For most websites of course, many of which can employ caching, that is a non-issue, even at large scale - witness the success of Wordpress in php which would not survive even modest loads without caching.",1352362306

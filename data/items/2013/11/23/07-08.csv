The amount varies but is primarily influenced by how &quot;poor&quot; the district is.  I&#x27;ve been involved with some districts in some extremely poor areas that had full gigabit (or more) fiber links between their schools and the district office and then out to the Internet.  They get this money by applying through the e-rate grant process.  I know of cases where the funding paid for 90% of the cost of installation.",1385193568

Encrypt everything before uploading, decrypt on download (and I don&#x27;t mean SSL, I mean client encrypts, sends encrypted data over SSL, data is stored encrypted, only decrypted by client).</i><p>Yep, client-side encryption is the only working solution.<p>The funky bit is that on Linux you can make this fully transparent at the OS level. Expose remote storage via iSCSI, and attach to it so the storage shows up as a block device on your client system. Then put regular on-disk (&quot;partition level&quot;) encryption on top of the blockdevice using cryptsetup, and that&#x27;s it. All storage data sent over the wire is now encrypted, and the crypto mapping layer takes care of hiding the gritty details.<p>Because the encryption happens beneath the filesystem layer, all the usual tools work as before. For them the only difference is the latency. (Network connection naturally causes an upper bound that is way lower than a local drive.) Works wonderfully for backups, where you want to do incrementals in any case. Just ship rdiff deltas and have a backup tool which takes care of the work.<p>I actually implemented this as my Master&#x27;s thesis back in 2006, only to be informed later on that logically identical construct had been shown as early as 2003.",1385191838

I haven&#x27;t done game development in almost 9 years, but the &quot;Perforce saturating the LAN&quot; problem sounds very familiar!<p>So I&#x27;m actually working on a (binary) software distribution system, and I think it would work very well for this use case.  This problem can be solved with software -- it doesn&#x27;t require an upgrade to fiber.<p>The (straightforward) idea is to use content-addressed storage and differential compression, pretty much like Git does.  Then you can actually sync data from your neighbor&#x27;s machine, in a BitTorrent-ish fashion (possibly getting tiny amounts of metadata from a central server for consistency).  Perforce definitely has problems with spurious lock contention, and just a few team members syncing from the same machine can easily clog its pipes if you&#x27;re not careful.<p>I&#x27;m not up to date, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you can do better than Perforce&#x27;s delta compression.  You can probably do it with a single generic algorithm, but one way to really improve would be to use file-type specific compression, e.g. bsdiff or Chrome&#x27;s Courgette for executables, and use other heuristics for game data, raw audio, video, etc.  You actually want to avoid single-file compression in the repository so you can take advantage of the differential compression.<p>I can understand that the dynamics of game development teams means that this will never get written in house (although perhaps in the years since I&#x27;ve left, people started placing more emphasis on tools).<p>But for all the entrepreneurs out there, I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss the market of selling tools to game developers.

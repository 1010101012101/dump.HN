I hope to post slides afterward.<p>If you find yourself needing to implement crypto, it's likely you can avoid it by thinking about the situation differently. For example, many web developers get seduced into designing their own crypto as a way to push state to the client instead of managing it on the server. This opens up a much wider attack surface on the server application since now every part of that blob needs to be considered malicious. As the saying goes, ""... now you have two problems.""<p>The reason all this is so hard is that crypto is fundamentally unsafe. People hear that crypto is <i>strong</i> and confuse that with <i>safe</i>. Crypto can indeed be very strong but is extremely unsafe.<p>Have you ever tried to clean up from a root private key compromise? I wrote previously (<a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/17/the-debian-pgp-disaster-that-almost-was/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/17/the-debian-pgp-disaster-tha...</a>) about how a one-line change in the PRNG had compromised every DSA private key <i>used</i> on Debian/Ubuntu. Not generated, used. The properties of DSA make it such that your private key is directly revealed to any attacker who knows some bits of your PRNG output. I hope that emphasizes how dangerous crypto is, because it is so sensitive to its prerequisites.",1242945277

In the sort of teams one typically finds in those 500+ person organisations, nothing is truly done by individuals.<p>Even if a genius developer produces a brilliant implementation of new feature quickly and with a low bug count, someone had the idea for that feature and worked out how it was going to integrate with other features, many people probably wrote a load of other code the feature depends on even if that code didn't itself create the same buzz, people were involved in testing the feature, producing the marketing, and on and on. While everyone might agree that the genius developer had done a good job for the team, how can you say quantitatively and objectively what his contribution was? 10%? 25%? 90%?<p>In contrast, the success of a project team is generally fairly easy to quantify: divide the cost of running the team by the amount of revenue generated by the projects they produce.<p>The sad reality is that while serious guru developers may indeed be an order of magnitude more productive than average, and some at the other end of the scale are actually counterproductive, salaries for employees will never realistically reflect this. The bottom-feeders always get more than they deserve, while the top guys will never get credit proportionate to their contribution. After all, this is why many of us get out and go freelance or start our own businesses.<p>But within that reality, I can't help wondering whether the guys at the top would still rather work with a motivated team than be individually slightly better compensated but surrounding by jealous, bitter colleagues.",1242944240

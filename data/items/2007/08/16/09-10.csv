VC's are similar.  And so it's just a self-referential loop that spirals upwards.<p>The only problem is that 90% of Silicon Valley startups are that kind of meringue and marshmallow that VC love.  The record companies love Britney Spears and VC's love Twitter.  It's all a big get-rich-quick scheme and a waste of time.  Sadly, as a native of Silicon Valley, it means that true innovation, when it is happening, is occurring everywhere.",1187258196

There are quite a few open source platforms that produce swfs (open laszlo, aptana, even flex is open source now). Regarding the flash player, it is not any more closed software than IE is.<p>Also isn't it nice not to have to write javascript code for each browser that exists out there?",1187254845

I would love to try and hack in a feature to Gmail that makes it permanently associate certain From email adddresses with people.

My point was that from an  environmental perspective, this device is basically on par with available power generation in terms of efficiency, and when used with natural gas simply moves the co2 generation from a centralized location to many distributed locations, but doesn't cut it down significantly per unit energy produced.<p>IF the device were to be used with biomass fuel, it would certainly be a huge step forward environmentally, but I don't see where the incentive would be outside of environmental stewardship, which some companies value but many do not.
From your reply: ""...which means it could be used to store PV energy collected during the day and reuse it at night. But, this system produces so much more energy than a PV cell that I'm not sure it would be of much use.""
This is exactly why I wouldn't call it a game changer from an environmental standpoint.  Basically we're still stuck with the fact that it's much easier to produce power by burning, oxidizing in a fuel cell, etc. than by using solar, wind etc.
In my book a game changer would be a technology that enables a move to truly renewable power generation while remaining practical and cost effective.  Could the energy server fit that description? Perhaps, but it depends highly upon how it is operated.",1267096353

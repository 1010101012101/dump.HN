S3 is great in theory but a pain to integrate. The same goes for EBS, which is really pricey for more than a little.

Pretty much all smart phones allowed installation of applications from third parties before the iPhone and App Store. The success of the App Store, for Apple's bottom line, was the primary motivation for several other vendors introducing similar markets.<p>But, I wasn't talking about iTunes (though there are probably things to say about iTunes, I don't really know enough about it; as I mentioned, I've been an eMusic user for many years, and have never wanted anything iTunes had to offer; besides that iTunes doesn't run under Linux, so I can't use it). I'm talking about specific negative things Apple has done for openness and creativity in the technology world with the iPhone and the iPad, which is the subject of all of these rants.<p>The iPhone and iPad are the most tightly controlled ecosystems in their respective niches (if we count netbooks and other tablets as in the iPad niche, which I kinda think we have to, for now). This is a <i>bad</i> thing.<p>And, I was saying that the kind of apologia you're using is enabling Apple to do these bad things. One shouldn't apologize for bad things Apple has done by presenting the good or neutral things Apple has done. We know that the closed nature of the iPhone/iPad and the App Store ecosystem is bad for developers and bad for tinkerers and would-be hackers. We should call them on that bad behavior.<p>Praise them all you want for other behaviors, but don't use it as an excuse for the bad things they do.",1270237530

You did not own your music and you could only play it on a number of devices.  Concurrently, many music publishers were trying to develop technological means to prevent users from taking music from CDs they had purchased and ripping them to MP3's.<p>Overall, I rate that as a win for consumers.  A double win considering the later removal of DRM from iTunes music.<p>2) Before the iTunes video store, you could buy a few DRM encumbered videos from Amazon (pretty sure they were the only game in town at that time).  Some of the current stores for digital video don't even allow you to view video on a device different from the one you purchased it on.  There is still not a really great source of High Def video.<p>Overall, I rate that as a neutral to slight win for consumers.<p>3) Before the iPhone App store, the only way you could get an application was through a carrier approved store.  The apps themselves were 99% garbage and if you changed phones, good luck transferring them.  With the iPhone App store, there has been a cambrian explosion of mobile software.  Despite the denial of apps in several specific categories and contentious policies regarding duplication of built in software, for the most part there is an app for that.  The best part though is that applications do not depend on carrier approval for the most part and handsets are free to transfer across networks provided they are hardware compatible.  I would like to remind you again that before June 2007, this shit was fantasy.<p>Overall, I rate that as a win for consumers.",1270235222

I resent the thought of getting trapped in one vendor's world by becoming dependent on closed, proprietary products and will always look for ways to avoid this.<p>5. Innovation is too dynamic for a single company ever to dominate the computing world <i>in toto</i> for any sustained period. IBM tried it in the 1960s and 1970s and Microsoft in the 1980s and 1990s. Apple appears poised to do so now but this will never stick.<p>6. Therefore, I sympathize with what the author of this post says but I also am relaxed about it. Three cheers for Apple and their great products. But may it never limit my choices for other great products in the future.",1270235124

In all this doom-and-gloom talk about how the iPad will destroy computing as we know it and Apple is the new evil empire, etc. etc., hardly anyone ever seems to weigh the happiness brought to consumers by their devices.<p>So let's not <i>just</i> focus on the theoretical-hacker-kid-who-will-now-never-learn-to-program, because they're not the only type of person affected by these devices.

2933665,comment,2932335,2932809,2,0,radiowave,,,"Yup, that's about the same proportion I found when I recently tried copying my data across to a ZFS system with the dedup switched on.<p>I then decided to disable the dedup, because it comes at a cost - the checksum data (which would mostly be living on the SSD read cache I had attached) was occupying about 3 times the monetary worth of SSD storage space than the monetary worth of conventional disk space that the duplicate data was occupying.<p>I noticed that the opendedup site (linked from the article) claims a much lower volume of checksum data, relative to number of files; perhaps an order of magnitude less than I observed with ZFS, but they seem achieve that by using a fixed 128KB block size, which brings along its own waste. (ZFS uses variable block size.) I haven't actually done the numbers here but I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that for my data, the 128KB block size would be costing as much disk space as what dedup was saving me.

2933656,comment,2933102,2933158,1,0,michael_dorfman,,,"Short version: most branches of Buddhism don't have this kind of notion at all-- it is pretty unique to Tibetan Buddhism, where there are a relatively small number of <i>tulku</i> lineages, where a person can be recognized as an incarnation of the prior holder of the lineage.  (The Dalai Lama is the most famous example-- the current Dalai Lama is the 14th in the series.)  Incarnations are officially recognized by other <i>tulkus</i>, according to tradition; for example, the Dalai Lama is usually recognized by the Panchen Lama.<p>Without knowing the details in this case, I am assuming that the person in question falsely claimed to have been recognized as a <i>tulku</i>.  I can't imagine that this was part of the job requirements.<p>So, an analog would be falsely claiming on your CV to have won a prestigious award (say, the Turing Award).<p>It's a pretty outrageous lie; but then again, so is claiming to have cancer.",1314524211

2933653,comment,2928960,2932071,2,0,dalke,,,"pressure = Integral[h=x to infinity] of rho g(h) dh where x is the current distance from the center. ""h"" here means ""height."" Since we're at the center, x=0. Since rho(vacuum) = 0, this reduces to Integral[h=0:200km] rho g(h) dh. I simplify and say that water is incompressible, with density of rho = 1000 kg/m<i>m</i>m. (At 1 giga pascals the density is 1.2 that of its normal density.)<p>g(r) = G * M(r) / r * r where M(r) is the mass inside a sphere of radius r. That's G (rho 4/3 pi r * r * r) / r * r or 4/3 rho G pi r.<p>Therefore, pressure = Integral[h=0:200km] rho * (4/3 rho G pi h) dh. This is 2/3 rho * rho G pi h * h, giving 5.6 mega pascals.<p>Looking at the phase diagram you pointed out, 6MPa is well within the liquid range. (Presumably the temperature would be around 4C). Even with a higher density it's at most about 7MPa, and you need to get to 1 GPa for water to always be a solid.<p>In other words, unless I did my math wrong or left something out of the calculations, this water sphere isn't close to one of the ice phases of water.<p>BTW, for more fun, since there's no heat source for the water (radioactive decay, heat from the phase change to ice, etc), then how does it stay liquid? If exposed to vacuum it would turn to vapor until it cooled down enough (about -60C) to freeze. There isn't enough mass to hold down much atmosphere, so I presume it's covered.<p>How also does it get enough energy to stay liquid? Most of the energy will be dumped into the top layer, so there will be a warm zone on top of a thermocline, like with Earth's oceans. If the energy comes from the sun, then do the poles freeze? If it doesn't rotate fast enough then the backside will freeze.<p>If ice does form, it reflects more heat than water so that region will stay ice.",1314524059

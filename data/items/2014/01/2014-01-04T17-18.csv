The arguments to why this is bad always seem to be of the slippery slope / what if somebody does something untoward with the data variety.<p>The first one is a easily-dismissed fallacy, the second is not limited to Google or any other company. I have yet to see a convincing argument that Google is misusing this data or doing anything bad with it.<p>On the other hand, a service that knows you intimately enough can provide some very cool things <i>that are otherwise impossible</i>. The cards on Google Now, for instance, rely completely on the search history on your account and the location data from your phone. I get up in the morning and my usual route to work is plotted out with an ETA. I search for a nearby restaurant on my computer and the directions appear on the phone complete with ratings. Things like that.<p>My philosophy is to deal with any abuses if/when they occur (and mitigate the forseeable ones), instead of walling yourself off from the ever-more connected world. I&#x27;m starting to think there&#x27;s a fundamental shift happening in what &quot;privacy&quot; is, why it&#x27;s necessary, and what it means nowadays. And as usual, the choices are hop on, get out of the way, or get run over. For better or worse.",1388858305

7012044,comment,7011368,7011767,7,0,javajosh,,,"This will be a useful lawsuit. I think that this will be a very different lawsuit from the one the ACLU is currently pursuing. First, it is being led by two US Senators from vastly different political perspectives, which gives it tremendous credibility with a wide base of people.<p>Additionally, if the USG falls back on the national security argument yet again, then this will damage the Obama administration&#x27;s credibility even more, and that will be a useful outcome as well.<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s funny how quickly Obama has gone from a novelty (first black president, exciting!) to just a very weak, unprincipled leader, and who weakens himself even more with every backroom deal with wall street, every promotion of Bush-era hawks, every prosecution of reporters under the Espionage Act, and every defense of mass surveillance of Americans. My sense is that he is under the full sway of his advisors and underlings, and he lacks the <i>cajones</i> to think for himself and stand up to them when they argue for practicality over principle. Clearly our political system needs to do a better job of selecting strong, intelligent, moral leaders, rather than just well-spoken ones. (An interesting problem in itself, and one which I think is only partly addressed by campaign finance reform.)<p>But the other lesson from this is that our system of checks and balances is not working. This suit is an attempt to use the judicial to check the executive. A laudable attempt to work within the system. But as you mention, the executive is not shy about playing their trump card - keeping secrets vital to national security - rendering a judicial check impossible. Meanwhile, Congress is still in very poor shape, with Tea Party morons so fixated on taxation that they ignore everything else. (Although I must admit, that in times like these &quot;starve the beast&quot; does seem mighty appealing. What the <i>hell</i> are we doing giving Obama <i>$1T</i> a year to play with, given his lack of judgement and scruples? Indeed, what man or woman exists that can be trusted with that kind of power, especially given the glaring weaknesses in our system of checks and balances?)<p>We&#x27;ve seen some egregious, shameless use of structural weaknesses in our system, hacks that previous generations of senators and presidents have been deeply reluctant to use - apparently well aware of the cost of using them. Executive use of &quot;national security&quot; to quash judicial check is one; indiscriminate and constant use of filibuster to intentionally stop congress from functioning at all, even on routine matters.<p>Fundamentally, political systems are designed to allow people with conflicting views to live in peace together, and to cooperate for mutual benefit. Without these systems, we devolve into tribes, mainly on ethnic and racial grounds, fighting for dominance over each other. We went from democracy at the city-state level, back to absolute monarchy, and now we&#x27;re trying democracy at the national level.<p>But remember this is all new ground; the US is only 238 years old. In essence, the US is a startup, and it might fail, and it could fail catastrophically or just kind of fizzle out.

7012024,comment,7011472,7011774,5,0,salient,,,"If I were Larry Page, I would put homomorphic encryption research at a much higher priority than quantum computers, or even researching robots (unless they intend to make most of their money from robots within a few short years, and not rely as much on search money, but that seems pretty unlikely in the short term).<p>If they plan on continuing to make money from tracking users, then they&#x27;d better figure out a way to do it very securely and without invading user privacy, otherwise they&#x27;re going to feel an increasingly bigger pain in terms of public perception of Google over this, which could lead to them losing money in the long term, too.<p>I would also forget about tracking &quot;everything possible&quot; until then, and encrypt end-to-end stuff like chatting and video-calls (maybe they can do this one less costly through P2P or a hybrid system). I very much doubt they see a ton of money as a return from tracking and data mining people&#x27;s chats online. And the downside is quite huge, because those online chats can be abused by the governments. So why not secure them properly? A little cost to them, huge privacy benefit to their users.<p>The goal should be to only track <i>public</i>, and not <i>private</i> information (at least in the short term, and then they should use homomorphic encryption for public information, too, as that will become increasingly more revealing, too, in the future).<p>I would also pay a lot of attention to what the Dark Mail Alliance is doing with e-mail encryption, and I would at the very least implement their protocol as an option for people who want to talk securely with others, from inside Gmail. They don&#x27;t necessarily have to make all of Gmail encrypted by default, although that would obviously be very nice, but probably not very practical until they figure out homomorphic encryption.<p>There are also other things they could do to make e-mails a little more secure against abusive governments. In the US, ECPA allows the government to take the e-mail after 180 days without a warrant. So how about you ask people to give a password to G-mail, that&#x27;s locally stored, and can <i>automatically</i> encrypt emails older than 179 days.

7011921,comment,7011472,7011472,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The complaint seems to boil down to how Google deals with spammers. The question is, how is competition going to make it better? If we instead had five search engines that each had 20% market share, would people stop trying to game them? Would false positives in efforts to thwart spammers be eliminated? How?<p>The problem isn&#x27;t even one that responds to market forces -- the &quot;victims&quot; (sites that should rank highly in organic results) are no one&#x27;s customers. If you want to flip the script, they&#x27;re the product. They have no leverage, and having more search engines leaves them with still no leverage. Only the users of the search engine have leverage because they can switch to another search engine -- but they can do that today. The problem is the alternatives are no better.<p>What we need is a cost-effective accurate way to identify spammers and exclude them from high rankings in search results. Someone who could do that more effectively could challenge Google, because there is a market for spam-free search results. But if that was an easy problem to solve then why hasn&#x27;t Google solved it? They have the right incentives. It&#x27;s just not easy, because spammers adapt. Whenever a search engine does something to thwart spammers, the spammers do something different.<p>Having more search engines doesn&#x27;t make it easier, it makes it harder because each search engine has less resources to dedicate to it and they have to duplicate each other&#x27;s work, and the cost to sites of legitimate optimization for a larger number of search engines increases which creates an even larger advantage for major institutions over small timers who can&#x27;t afford the higher cost.<p>It&#x27;s silly to say &quot;why doesn&#x27;t Google do X&quot; and list some abstract thing you think would solve it which they&#x27;ve already considered and declined to do. There is probably a reason. Maybe manually curating every website is too expensive. Maybe arbitration proceedings would be overrun with spammers trying to challenge legitimate removals of their spam. And if they&#x27;re wrong, don&#x27;t speculate about it on a blog, prove it by building a better search engine. So far no one has been able to do it.",1388856816

Those member banks have shareholders consisting of local private banks. These 12 banks don&#x27;t pick monetary policy. The Federal Reserve board does. Only 1 of the 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board can be picked from the leadership of the 12 member banks. Since the Federal Reserve Board is what actually decides monetary policy, its nonsensical to think of the Federal Reserve as a federation. Because its not. Its a central bank, and has very centralized power.<p>(2) While banks are part shareholders in the central bank&#x27;s member banks, IT IS NOT ORGANIZED LIKE AN ACTUAL CORPORATION. They do not &#x27;own&#x27; federal reserve banks. They cannot sell their shares, and make no money from them (well, they might earn meager interest). Its literally just a deposit that they make with the Fed that entitles them to send representatives to their regional bank. Even if each member bank was totally dominated by the will of their member banks (which there is no incentive for this to be the case), the sum of their influence on monetary policy is their single representative in the board of governors (who was confirmed by congress!)<p>(3) The federal government does not borrow directly from the Fed. It issues bonds to the general bond market through weekly auctions directly from the Treasury, and the Fed buys those in the aftermarket to manipulate interest rates. Doing this requires them to add or subtract cash from the money supply.

Moreover, if bitcoin ever gets big enough to have an actual economy that isn&#x27;t just people converting to US dollar (ie, rent, bills, and wages are paid with bitcoin), we&#x27;ll have a grand opportunity to test whether having monetary policy is actually a good thing, or if its bad. Because if its bad, and we discover that having a central bank control the money supply is actually a Good Idea, then consumers WILL NOT choose bitcoin.<p>Hopefully by then there will be some implementation by some central bank somewhere that makes sense, so that we get all the benefits of a digital currency without all the inflexibility of bitcoin&#x27;s built in monetary policy.",1388856041

You don&#x27;t work out everything from scratch every time you encounter a medium hard problem.<p>Unless you actually do, in which case someone reasonably clever who does not stubbornly refuse to learn a few formulas will beat you by speed. Which is a reason to hire them over you.<p>That&#x27;s the the point. You may be very smart and capable doing it this way, but learning a few basics (such as Bayes, in the context of statistics) doesn&#x27;t really <i>cost</i> you anything. Memorizing a few things isn&#x27;t hard. You won&#x27;t actually run into problems like &quot;erroneous thinking&quot; because you&#x27;re smart enough and knowing the conditions under which something holds is easy enough when you <i>understand</i> the thing. Additionally you get the knowledge when a particular important theorem does <i>not</i> hold, which is higher level knowledge that you just can&#x27;t get when you reason from scratch every time (positive vs negative knowledge).<p>Memorizing a few of the basic important theorems and formulas in your field is such low-hanging fruit to improve yourself that a potential employer might ask why you&#x27;re not doing it, even if you&#x27;re so very capable without doing it.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s <i>communication</i> with your peers. Maybe you can figure that stuff out by yourself easily, but when your colleagues say &quot;ah, so we just use Bayes and poof&quot;, you&#x27;ll be lagging behind figuring that out, and in reverse when you do these things from scratch, I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;ll be doing them much quicker, speeding through your ad hoc methods, leaving your team mates confused and wondering &quot;why don&#x27;t he just use Bayes?&quot; (which may or may not be what you are in fact doing, but you lack the knowledge to tell them as much).<p>I&#x27;m sure you do a very good job at what you&#x27;re doing now, the way you&#x27;re doing it. I&#x27;m just pointing out that there are various well-justified reasons why employers can be wary of your refusal to memorize some basic field-knowledge, even when you&#x27;re perfectly capable figuring out that stuff when you need it.",1388856009

Extended the right to vote to certain leaseholders and householders. 5 adults out of every 100 could vote.<p>1867 Second Reform Act. Further extension of the voting regulations in counties and boroughs. 13 adults out of every 100 could vote, but still based on wealth.<p>1872 Secret Ballot Act. Introduced voting by secret ballot.<p>1884 Representation of the People Act. Any male occupying land or property with an annual rateable value of £10 could vote. 24 adults out of every 100 could vote.<p>1918 Representation of the People Act. All males over the age of 21 were given the vote. Women over 30 got the vote. Women could sit in the House of Commons as MPs. 75 adults out of every 100 could vote.<p>1928 Representation of the People Act. Uniform voting rights were extended to all men and women over the age of 21. 99 adults out of every 100 could vote.<p>1969 Representation of the People Act. The voting age was reduced to all men and women over the age of 18.<p>1985 Representation of the People Act. Voters who, at the time of an election, are abroad, either working or on holiday, may apply for a postal vote.<p>2000 Representation of the People Act.

It is a obvious fact that in the past 20-30 years, every discipline has made a huge push to attract more women, with great success. The real problem today is that computer science/programming needs to attract women <i>in a world of incredibly stiff competition</i>.<p>Why is enrollment declining? Is it that unreasonable to suspect that the answer is &quot;because computer science is being outcompeted by the <i>dozens upon dozens</i> of other disciplines making women better offers&quot;?<p>I deliberately phrase this as &quot;computer science&quot; and not &quot;computer scientists&quot; because I&#x27;m unconvinced the problem is in the people. &quot;But sometimes, there are misogynists in the computer world&quot;... how is that <i>unique</i>? Every field had that problem. Today, computer scientists have been damn near actively <i>begging</i> for women, to the point that the <i>solicitousness itself is becoming offensive</i>, as the author points out. There gets to be a point where advocacy turns into trying to tell women what to do.<p>Unless both genders are <i>precisely equally</i> drawn to every single discipline, an idea which I think is itself rather offensively insensitive (&quot;feminism&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be defined as &quot;women are just funny-looking men&quot; but my goodness is that a popular version if you really look at what people believe), there&#x27;s going to be unbalanced disciplines.<p>This goes against some of the doctrines, and so I think people tend to put this argument when I make in the wrong bucket, but personally I think the question of whether we&#x27;re trying to <i>tell</i> women what to like and how to like it is itself a feminist question. &quot;So we should just stop trying because it&#x27;s hopeless, huh?&quot; No, I don&#x27;t think that. Roll the carpet out, with all due honesty and openness, sure... but if nobody chooses to walk on it, that may very well simply be their decision (in aggregate).

Also, giving special privileges to all the known groups will just disenfranchise the people not associated with any particular groups (in this case, one might consider trans people). <i>Human equality</i> (or even including non-human-persons equality) would seem a better ideal than just male-female equality.<p>If we&#x27;re actually intelligent creatures, let&#x27;s try and fix the underlying problems instead of just pushing them around for someone else to suffer from.",1388854885

If something is going to break because of a manufacturing defect, it will usually do so within the first six months and almost always within the first twelve months. If it breaks after two years, that&#x27;s not the manufacturer&#x27;s fault. Now as a socialist, you could say who cares about right and wrong, isn&#x27;t it great for you as a consumer that you can take money from the manufacturer? But the truth is that the money comes out of your pocket in the end, because the manufacturer has to charge a higher price to make it worthwhile to be in business in Norway. The forced excessive warranty just creates bad incentives and takes away choice.",1388854818

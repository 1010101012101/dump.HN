I displayed the portraits of ALL PRIOR PRESIDENTS, and NONE OF THEM LOOK LIKE OBAMA. Even if that as-perfect-as-humanly-possible disproof was somehow ""inadequate"", the proof in the first place was completely absent...only a bald declaration.</i><p>What on earth are you talking about?",1201665592

106655,comment,106398,106614,0,0,shiro,,,"IMHO, it's not an issue of <i>implementation</i>.  It's an issue of <i>design</i>.<p>If PG explicitly says ""ok, I don't have time to do Unicode stuff now, but my idea is that a string is a sequence of characters, regardless of how a 'character' is represented"", then somebody can go ahead to change Arc Unicode-clean (it won't be much work assuming MzScheme has support of Unicode).<p>If PG says ""the language Arc (not mere an implementation) doesn't support beyond Ascii"", then I feel that PG reserves that part of design (e.g. it may conflate byte-array and multibyte strings, or it may use richer character representation than unicode codepoint, such as a character object that holds the sequence of base char + modifiers, or it may hold raw byte array plus encoding info).  In that case I hesitate to change Arc code without understanding PG's intention.",1201665002

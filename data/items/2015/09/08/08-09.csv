It&#x27;s a thoughtful treatment of functional programming that happens to use ML, and a book I enjoy reading rather than just referring to. I appreciate the fact that the second edition introduces modules very early on, and that it&#x27;s relatively un-mathematical in the way it presents things like module semantics.<p>Robert Harper&#x27;s &quot;Programming in Standard ML&quot; (online only I think, at <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/smlbook/book.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/smlbook/book.pdf</a>) is more thorough.

No one is &#x27;followed up closely&#x27; in some expensive human-driven procedure. It&#x27;s all automated. The cost of someone going overdrawn by £10 is pennies.<p>It can&#x27;t be expensive because most banks will give you a free overdraft if you ask. Sometimes even if you don&#x27;t ask. I&#x27;ve had a £1500 overdraft facility on my bank since I opened a student account 18 years ago. Back then I used it a lot without any fees. Now I don&#x27;t use it at all but it&#x27;s still there. If that overdraft cost anything I wouldn&#x27;t have it. The only time you get charged is if you haven&#x27;t planned and set things up ahead of time.

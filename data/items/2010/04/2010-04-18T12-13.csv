They have an expensive infrastructure that costs money every day simply to exist, whether or not it is being used.<p>It costs less money if no planes are flying at all (just like a chemical plant presumably costs less if you shut it down), but there are still ongoing costs to meet: salaries, administrative overheads, maintenance costs, regular check-ups, etc. If you count just these, the loss is already substantial.<p>Then of course there's the opportunity cost. Every day that they're not flying planes, they're not earning fees from passengers. As the costs are, presumably, just a bit lower than the revenues (hopefully), this more than doubles the previous number.<p>Also, they are actually paying back tickets (at least EasyJet is).",1271594439

There are plenty of powerful tools, and if you don't like the commandline (although you say you use unix a lot, ldap commands are straight forward), you probably could've used GUIs in the most cases. My ""feeling"" of this thread is that people were unsatisfied with openldap and now blame a protocol.
The major enterprise directories have a lot of additional commands/features/web interfaces to fiddle with.

The IATA said its estimate of a $200m daily loss of revenues was ""initial and conservative"".
""In addition to lost revenues, airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft, care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports,"" its director of corporate communications, Anthony Concil, said.
KPMG was less conservative in its estimates, predicting a £200m loss in traffic revenues as a result of the UK shutdown, assuming that all ticket sales would have to be refunded to passengers.
[/quote]<p>I'd say KPMG was rather silly, in that obviously passengers will need to get back and there's a bottle-neck at the channel tunnel and ferry ports. However as care is being paid they could actually end up paying out more than the cost of travel and make a loss even in the time after the skies open.",1271593129

This was the largest MUG in the world at the time, and to say it was an uphill battle would be an understatement. With Performas going unsold in places like Office Max and acquisition rumors running rampant (Apple is going to be bought by Disney! Apple is going to be bought by Sun!), it was incredibly difficult to be an Apple fanboy.<p>Frankly, they could have added the name ""beleaguered"" to their name and nobody would have blinked.  Every bloody news story that ever came out about Apple described the company as ""beleaguered computer maker Apple Computer...""<p>Anyway, AMUG was a source of pride and optimism for the company.  At least it should have been.  I can't tell you how many times I tried to call on reps at the company for assistance and was rebuffed.  I'm not talking about financial support, either. I was asking for things like t-shirts and stickers.  Simple stuff.  Apple reps treated MUGs like they were the proverbial ""Cousin It"" of the family -- to be barely acknowledged, if at all.<p>I'm happy for Apple's success. Really.

It's pretty much unworkable. Train is not a single rigid body, it's composed from bogies and car bodies, and they are only quite loosely attached. They absolutely have to be.

Earning the respect of those underneath you and being able to really understand what they are doing (or most of what they're doing) is important.<p>Let's put it this way, if two of your programmers are recommencing different approaches and O(whatever) is relevant, you'd best know that and why!  (And yes, seriously, I've seen one major software client/server project fail due to a new manager coming from a single user CD-ROM application environment and just not being able to grok scaling, which is after all inescapable for almost all modern interesting projects today).  Doing 6.001/SICP plus following up on a few things in it you find interesting might be all the CS foundation you really need, though (well, you should study some systems stuff including security as well).<p>But your point about Software Engineering is well taken; only so much of that is taught in a normal CS curriculum, it's something that needs serious independent study (something I myself started doing a few months into my first programming experience (in high school) and never stopped).  Read with attention to detail the 20th anniversary edition of <i>The Mythical Man Month</i>, <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i>, <i>Peopleware</i>, the Antipatterns book, something that looks relevant by Gerald Weinberg and a methodology book (I prefer <i>The Unified Software Development Process</i> or, now, look for the latest iteration of it (but I suspect you need at least one experienced programmer to make it work), or you could go explicitly agile) and then go from there.<p>(Even Weinberg ancient classic <i>The Psychology of Computer Programming</i> is still somewhat relevant: I still use the anecdote about two people or teams working on a card reading module.

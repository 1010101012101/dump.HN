6583,comment,6495,6495,0,0,BrandonM,,,"""Hold some features back in your first release.<p>Release them next week or next month. This makes your customers think that you are actively developing your product and that there is momentum behind your product.""<p>This statement really irks me, not just as a programmer, but as a consumer.  I initially thought the article might be a little joke, but since the other tips were more reasonable, I have to assume that it is serious.  I can understand holding back features in your initial release, but there are much better reasons than those that were cited.  To purposely trick your potential users seems to me to be a bad business model, and smells of the corporate mindset of money and growth over all else. I think it is important to remember that the whole point of developing a product is to fulfill a need (or want) of the customer, and I think that as the average consumer gets more intelligent, these types of tactics will be more transparent and will do more harm than good to the startup.<p>As for better reasons for holding back features:<p>1. In any interesting piece of software, I would imagine that there are potentially hundreds of features which could be added.  The difficult problem is deciding when to be (temporarily) content with what you have and release.  Thus, some desired features must be left out in order to avoid the perfectionist mindset, where nothing ever gets released.<p>2. A mostly-implemented feature may work correctly most of the time, but fail mysteriously at other times. Even with a beta release, it's probably best to avoid these types of features which only serve to make your product less reliable.<p>3. A feature may be fully-implemented, but there may be no clear way to integrate it into the UI.  In this case, it would probably be best to hold off and drop hints of the feature to beta testers, who could give their feedback on how best to integrate it.  After all, the feature is meant for the users to actually use, isn't it?<p>4. A feature may add computational complexity to the software which may be overly taxing on the initial hardware that a startup company is using. Improve the hardware before adding the feature, or better yet, improve the code which implements the feature.<p>\nAm I being overly idealistic?  Am I alone in thinking that the proposed ""marketing trick"" is a bad idea?",1174988226

6580,comment,6551,6554,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I would say that the answer to your last question should be a resounding ""yes"".  The whole point of the ""beta"" label is to alert potential users that the product is not completely stable, but is in some usable state.  The problem is not so much that the service was not 100% reliable, but that the NYT readers expected it to be and relied critically upon it.<p>As most Linux and 'BSD users have come to learn, ""beta"" means just that: not ready for critical use.  The user gains some privileges, like being able to use ""bleeding-edge"" software or to get a valuable service for free, and in return they sacrifice the stability and reliability that comes with time-tested software; all that as they actually are an integral piece to testing that software. Without such a beta stage, the whole rapid development movement would fail as projects get mired in extensive internal testing stages.<p>Your GMail comment especially strikes me, as I hadn't considered that before.  Perhaps they grew much faster than anticipated and are still working on stability issues, and the ""losing my emails"" scenario may not be far off the mark.  By attaching the ""beta"" label to their service, they can probably avoid any liability that may arise if such an event did occur.",1174987192

If ""cell regeneration"" refers to brain cells, then I'm old. If it refers to organ tissue cells or something, maybe I can call myself ""young."" Slim chance though, haha.\nMy problem is that I get bad food comas unless I sleep something 9 hours a day; this is a long-term observation over many years. I don't know anybody at my age who sleeps 9 hours though.",1174986253

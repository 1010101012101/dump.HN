9792141,comment,9790437,9791628,0,0,jsprogrammer,,,">I disagree here, because the inevitable result of a highly visible series of failed reproductions is a big media hit.<p>Interesting proclamation.<p>If a result can&#x27;t be replicated after many &#x27;highly visible&#x27; attempts then the result should be called into serious question.<p>>The scientific community may be able to poke holes in the reproduction attempt and sort through the damage, but the media and the court of public opinion certainly can&#x27;t. Not until long after the reputations of possibly faultless scientists have been ruined irreparably.<p>This sounds like unwarranted fatalism to me. If the result was not reproduced because the experiment was not actually reproduced...I don&#x27;t see what the issue is here.<p>>So it&#x27;s important for the reproduction attempts to be as high quality and rigorous as we would hope the original studies were. And it behooves scientists to make sure that these attempts are legitimate, unbiased and equitable, and to investigate any experimental flaws and biases of the experimenters before the results.<p>This is why it is critical for any researcher that desires credibility (and more importantly: explanatory power) to detail their work accurately enough that someone else can exactly replicate their experiments in order to provide independent verification of their claims.<p>The best way to ensure that replication attempts are &#x27;legitimate, unbiased and equitable&#x27; is to ensure your work is good enough that someone can actually (as opposed to merely attempting to) reproduce it.<p>>Misgivings about a reproduction attempt don&#x27;t indicate denial of the validity of the scientific process, but recognition of the volatility of scientific news media.<p>Maybe.<p>>The unfortunate reality is that both sides of this effort, both original researchers and reproduction attempts, are subject to a great number of biases and restrictions. Subjective opinion does deeply affect the lives of scientists, and it&#x27;s not possible for even the best scientists to live in a bubble of scientific purity and assume things will work out.<p>This sounds like something scientists need to work towards resolving.",1435456021

9792135,comment,9789819,9790123,0,0,e12e,,,"One idea that might be both workable, and possible would be to a) have reasonable way to choose CAs (not just, oh this, XYX corp sounds trustworthy, I&#x27;ll let them in), and b) have a capabilities system that&#x27;s not entirely embedded in the CA system.<p>So, I could have my own CA, or GNU/Debian could have their own CA -- and I/they could sign a capabilites document allowing NORID to sign off on .no-domains, but not on any other TLDs. Or I could trust Microsoft and Google with their own domains (a whitelist), and nothing else.<p>Such lists could be distributed in a similar way to certs and revocation lists -- and might take us from a 100% broken system, to a 80% working system -- which is probably as good as automated(ish) trust is going to get anyway.<p>[edit: I don&#x27;t think delegating trust is completely wrong.

9792133,comment,9791803,9791803,0,0,lionhearted,,,"1. There&#x27;s lots of good advice here. Don&#x27;t try to do all of it simultaneously; pick one or two things and really commit to them, and then review how well you&#x27;re doing in those areas once a week. You&#x27;ll have weeks of no progress, everyone does, but if you keep focusing on 1-2 areas until you&#x27;re happy with that result, almost anything can get improved over 3-6 months. Sometimes shorter, but ready yourself for more and pace yourself accordingly.<p>2. Start trying to meet more people and make more connections Friends, acquaintances, professional colleagues. Go to where people doing the type of statistics/marketing you&#x27;re doing hang out, and get to know them. In-person is better than online, but if you&#x27;re not near a major metropolitan area, online would be okay too.<p>You could, for instance, find some discussion forum devoted to marketing/statistics, and learn, post there, follow up, etc.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be purely professional related, but if there&#x27;s overlap between the work you want to do and the type of people you&#x27;re meeting, you&#x27;ll have more job offers. There&#x27;s a number of studies showing that the vast majority of hires made aren&#x27;t from applying blindly by sending in resumes, but based on recommendations and personal relationships.<p>So -- get to know more people. It&#x27;ll probably also help with your self-esteem. I&#x27;d also recommend never calling yourself &quot;broken goods&quot; or similar again: the world&#x27;s got enough antagonism in it without you getting on your own case.<p>But yeah, your main goal is get employed?

But I was not born in US so it took sometime to get my permanent residency. Now, I am ready to leave my full-time job and start working on my startup. I can support myself for next 6 months but my cofounder has dependents. So, he can&#x27;t leave his job without any salary right away. Because we are not from bay area, we are not connected in its inner circle. Friend and family funding is not an option. We are wary of raising seed money until we are sure that our idea has legs. So, we are thinking about doing part-time consultancy work in bay area to bring in enough money to pay the bills. I understand that it will be a distraction but I think it is necessary for us to go through the next 3-6 months. I have read patio11&#x27;s blog but I am not sure how to get some of those high paying consultancy jobs so that it is not a major time sink.
Personally I have worked at multiple major cloud companies of today. I have a lots experience in building really large scale systems, how to scale them on public cloud. My co-founder is also a software engineer. If you need someone to read a computer science paper and convert that to code, he is your guy. This are some of things we can do well: - Help build and scale technical architecture on cloud. - Develop BIG data applications for your startups. - Build your website or mobile apps.<p>If you have any suggestion on how to get part-time / project basis consultancy jobs in the bay area that will be great help.

According to the 2004 General Social Survey, one out of four Americans talked to no one about something of importance to them during the last six months. Another remarkable fact emerged from the 2000 U.S. Census: more people are living alone today than at any point in the country&#x27;s history—fully 25 percent of households consist of one person only.<p>In The Lonely American, cutting-edge research on the physiological and cognitive effects of social exclusion and emerging work in the neurobiology of attachment uncover startling, sobering ripple effects of loneliness in areas as varied as physical health, children&#x27;s emotional problems, substance abuse, and even global warming. Surprising new studies tell a grim truth about social isolation: being disconnected diminishes happiness, health, and longevity; increases aggression; and correlates with increasing rates of violent crime. Loneliness doesn&#x27;t apply simply to single people, either—today&#x27;s busy parents &#x27;cocoon&#x27; themselves by devoting most of their non-work hours to children, leaving little time for friends, and other forms of social contact, and unhealthily relying on the marriage to fulfill all social needs.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s an article for Britain:<p><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-loneliness-epidemic-more-connected-than-ever-but-feeling-more-alone-10143206.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/...</a><p>It&#x27;s everywhere.",1435454872

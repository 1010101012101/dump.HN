The general phone buying public doesn't care about any of those things. Japanese phones were 10 years ahead of the game 10 years ago. Like you even state, your crappy RAZR does most of the things people actually care about, and it is 5 years old. None of the recent ""innovations"" have sparked much interest amongst consumers.

635084,comment,634266,634710,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"""In the 4th century BC, Aristotle asked why the heat of the sun prompts us to sneeze, whereas the heat of the fire does not. A partial answer came two millennia later, when the English natural philosopher Francis Bacon showed that his photic sneeze had nothing to do with heat at all: if he closed his eyes when going into the sun, he didn't sneeze even though the heat was still there. While Bacon's application of the scientific method was beyond reproach, his conclusions are distinctly iffy to a modern nose. ""The cause is not the heating of the nostrils,"" he asserted, ""but the drawing down of the moisture of the brain.""<p>- <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227041.400-why-some-people-sneeze-when-the-sun-comes-out.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=brain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227041.400-why-some-...</a>",1243805260

Large company, 10k people.  Between meetings and actual work, she spends approximately 15 hours a DAY at work.  This is not abnormal.  Another friend who works at a kindergarden works 6 days a week (sunday is spent preparing lessons) and about the same (15-16 hours a day).<p>Read that again, tell me how that is not ""counterproductive"".  In my girlfriend's case,  the meetings alone take up 3-4 hours in a day.  She leaves at 7 AM and often gets back after midnight.  And for what?  So that the world can find out the latest gossip about Korean dramas with an easy-to-use GUI?<p>While working on my startup, I took a small contract at Fujitsu.  I was responsible for cleaning up the translations on some of their cell phones (the Docomo F1100 being the main one - a story for another day).  I had a chat with some people there and they told me how the game works; Fujitsu gives a small salary, and pays overtime.  As a result, average workers sit around for half the day, then work like nuts during overtime to finish their work.<p>A lot of younger workers realize this is madness, but keep in mind that the people in charge generally came up during a worker shortage in the ""bubble"" era.  These were less competent people who now have seniority in a seniority-based system.  Can you imagine how depressing it is to work on a project that you know is going to fail?  That's life.<p>I love Japan, I love the trains, I love the politeness and I love the people.  However, given a level playing field (IE: No banks artificially propping up a company to avoid declaring losses on their own records), it wouldn't take much to break the back of a lot of local companies.

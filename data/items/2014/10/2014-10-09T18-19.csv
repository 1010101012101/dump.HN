Is there a default for &quot;string in quotes&quot;? If there is, integers should be the default too.<p>I believe that everybody can invent as much red tape as he wants, the hard thing is making it concise and effective for the everyday use, not for the writers of compiler.<p>Digressing, were there any discussions about using var like in Swift (instead of let mut)?

There&#x27;s a total disconnect between what we hear from people looking to ease public anxiety and what we see and learn on the news.<p>It&#x27;s actually so contagious that even taking off your hazmat suit incorrectly can get you infected. That&#x27;s because the virus can live for some period on surfaces, and that&#x27;s the reason why doctors use a buddy system to remove their protective gear. It&#x27;s also the reason houses, vehicles, and hospital rooms have to be decontaminated after an ebola victim passes through.<p>According to the World Health Organization: &quot;People can be exposed to Ebola virus from direct physical contact with body fluids like blood, saliva, stool, urine, sweat etc. of an infected person and soiled linen used by a patient.&quot;<p>So, touch an ebola victim&#x27;s bedsheets and you can get the disease. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so alarmingly contagious. It is NOT like AIDS and it probably IS something we should worry about. In this case, public paranoia might actually save lives.<p>Here&#x27;s the link to the WHO site: <a href=""http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/epr-highlights/3648-frequently-asked-questions-on-ebola-hemorrhagic-fever.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemi...</a>",1412881080

(Many of the malls in KL had food courts with different ethnic food specialities.) Quite good. Roti canai (pronounced roti chanai) was one good item (among many - mentioning it because it is a breakfast item, the topic of this thread). It is like an Indian paratha, but with a bit more fat/oil used to make it. In the places where I ate it, they served it with an egg spread and cooked into the top surface of the roti.

So you end up with clueless young adults who become clueless adults. If you do try to teach yourself, you most likely resort to Google or Youtube, infinitely broad search engines with no filters whatsoever.

The only trouble is really on Firefox and any other browser that wants to implement a built-in H.264 decoder, but nothing stops them from working around that via things like OpenH264 or by using system decoders and so on.<p>The same will likely happen with H.265/HEVC, as the recently published licensing terms made it completely royalty-free to use the format itself (including for commercial purposes, you have to pay royalties for that with H.264), and you only have to pay to distribute decoders & encoders.<p>Personally I wish browser vendors would just use whatever&#x27;s installed on the user system for playing web videos, but for some reason that&#x27;s not okay because &quot;we need at least one unified always playing format for the web!&quot; and then we don&#x27;t get that anyway, as the whole WebM mess has clearly shown...<p>Anyway, since imgur is doing the conversion to video by themselves, there&#x27;s not really any reason why they couldn&#x27;t do both H.264 MP4s and VP8 WebMs... supporting only one format makes more sense if you allow direct user-encoded video uploads like 4chan does with its WebM support for example.

How they have so much debt and don&#x27;t know how to divide their paychecks, to put money in their savings while paying off their credit cards but while still using those same credit cards. I would like to know more about finances such as which credit cards to get, which banks are good for me, what kind of savings plan to start (Roth IRA, 401K, w/es), etc. from a knowledgeable and objective 3rd party with no ties to any of the companies they&#x27;re advocating for, and that&#x27;s the problem I face when I try to google these things because there&#x27;s just so much information out there and it&#x27;s hard to differentiate what&#x27;s ultimately the best for me.

It&#x27;s just that folk ideas about fluids insinuate themselves everywhere with sometimes irritating confidence. (For example, the book you cite!)<p>You&#x27;re right about the sail turning the flow. However, the &quot;curve&quot; of the sail is not the only way to turn a flow. In the keel&#x27;s case, it sees an angle of attack to the flow, and this causes lift. Imagine, for a moment, that the boat isn&#x27;t heeled over, and we&#x27;re looking down on the boat as it moves through the water. The bow of the boat, when pointing, points a few degrees upwind of the direction of travel of the boat relative to the water. We go back to the Kutta condition to see that the flow has to turn to point directly off the trailing edge of the keel and see that water is being &quot;thrown&quot; to leeward.<p>It&#x27;s a little more complicated than that, even, for keels, especially for full keels. They&#x27;re still &quot;throwing water,&quot; but they&#x27;re solidly &quot;low aspect ratio&quot; and finite wing effects dominate: Lower lift, higher drag, higher stall angle, softer stalls, attached vortices, and so on.

8434149,comment,8432919,8433772,0,0,pash,,,"The text of the amendment is not tautological in itself: nowhere else in the constitution is it made clear whether the enumerated powers are a mere sampling of the federal government&#x27;s authorities or an exhaustive list of them. So the Tenth Amendment is broadly understood to have codified the doctrine of enumerated powers—that is, the idea expressed by Madison in Federalist 45, that the enumerated powers are in fact meant to be taken as an exhaustive list.<p>That&#x27;s why the Tenth Amendment was included in the Bill of Rights, as is quite clear from the historical record of the drafting and ratifying process. (This is not controversial, as I imagine you know.) But the meaning of the Tenth Amendment and the practical extent of the enumerated powers doctrine was nevertheless a muddle from the start, owing partly to the tension with the necessary-and-proper clause.<p>No one was at all sure what it took to justify a specific federal action under one of the enumerated powers. The issuance of passports is not on the list of enumerated powers, but the wartime Department of Foreign Affairs (renamed the Department of State in September 1789) was carried over into the constitutional era, issuing passports all the while. The power to annex territory—also absent from the list; but Jefferson decided that he could purchase Florida and Louisiana. And so on and so forth.<p>Still, there were indeed rare moments in the the nineteenth century when judges invoked the Tenth to nullify acts of Congress, as in <i>Collector v. Day</i>, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 113 (1871), which stood until 1939. It is easy to imagine that the amendment was rarely invoked before the progressive era mostly because the doctrine of enumerated powers was firmly established; the powers of the federal government were, in actual practice, vastly less in those days. The Tenth Amendment has been even more rarely invoked since the early decades of the twentieth century because progressive judges completely eviscerated it.<p>The Tenth Amendment means essentially nothing today, you&#x27;re right, but that has not always been the case, and it&#x27;s not because the words themselves are meaningless.",1412878615

Our motivations were simple: know our tools inside and out, learn from the works of better hackers than ourselves, and hopefully get a jumpstart on contributing to the repos we love.<p>At first we treated the hangouts like a study group, but the sessions quickly evolved into one person preparing in advance and guiding the rest of the group through what they had discovered. Then one day, the authors of PolymerJS showed up to take part as we were dissecting their code (thank you, Twitter!). Around the same time, we had been getting requests to record the sessions for folks who couldn&#x27;t make it.<p>Eventually, we put two and two together and realized we ought to invite open source authors to read us their own works, broadcast live and recorded for posterity. What a great way to learn to write <i>kick-ass</i> code, pave the way for new contributors to a given project, and spread our enthusiasm for all things FOSS!<p>We&#x27;re now promoting and archiving these hangouts at <a href=""http://readthesource.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readthesource.io</a>. Last week we had Scott Corgan guide us through Superstatic, the static file server behind Divshot.com. On October 16th at 12:30 Pacific, Chris Matthieu and the Octoblu team will give us an inside look at Meshblu, a machine-to-machine instant messaging network and API that powers the Internet of Things (formerly known as SkyNet.im).<p>We have a few more unannounced hangouts in the pipeline and we&#x27;re actively looking for more guests. Our intention is to continue covering both popular projects and not-so-well-known, but uniquely interesting ones. In the mean time, we&#x27;d love to get your take on the general concept as well as our execution.<p>Thanks HN!",1412878395

When calls come out they usually come from certain areas of town at certain times of day or certain days of the week. You learn where all the bars are, when they let out, where those people are likely to go and what the odds are that that area will produce a new fare. Companies that are hiring a lot of workers at once house their workers in certain preferred hotels. Longer-term contractors are likely to live in certain other neighborhoods. In my case it was Jacksonville and you have a navy base here where a large number of sailors from various foreign countries will show up all at once needing to go places when their ship comes in.

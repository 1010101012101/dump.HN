They've already discounted it in their minds and they're just using industry bullshit-speak to explain it.<p>I would love to punch Hani Suleiman in the face.",1183667140

And most people have no ability to evaluate the dangers of coding errors.<p>Society doesn't have the right to demand protection from untalented programmers.  If you try to pay as little $$$ as possible, your app may suck, it may never get built, the wrong app may get built, etc...  If you pay top dollar, the same thing may happen.  If you can't evaluate code, you can't evaluate programmers, so you're hosed - and maybe you shouldn't be in this game.  If you decide to play it, buyer beware seems to work fine.<p>But the general public, whose medical information or ssn is in a database somewhere, didn't decide to play this game - the game was played on them.  So we'd say - you don't need any certification to code.  But you do need certification to handle certain types of personal data.<p>And if there's a major hack of an application, we (the public) get to know exactly whose ""certified"" signature was on that piece of paper.

They're not inserting any snippets of code (a la Google Analytics) and I'm going to assume that they don't have access to the server logs, so how are they tracking page hits?<p>Anyone know how they are tracking the stats without embedding code or looking at logs?  I'm probably missing something very simple and not knowing is... annoying :)",1183666285

32653,comment,32553,32641,0,0,willarson,,,"Consumers will buy the products that grant them the most utility. Workers have resources to create the environment such that safe workplaces create products with higher utility (by striking in unsafe environments, demanding higher pay in unsafe environments). Thus workplace safety can be, <i>and is</i>, enforced by consumer demand.<p>
Product safety is indeed regulated by consumer demand. People who value safety purchase safer cars, and safer cars exist to be purchased. When contact solution of a certain brand was found to be contaminated earlier this year, people stopped using it, even before the findings were certain. This is because the expected utility of using the product had fallen compared to that of other brands, and thus it was no longer worth its price.<p>
Pollution control is similar to safety. People are willing to pay a premium for less polluting alternatives. Look at Google scrambling to declare itself a green entity. Look at the resurgence of locally grown food (which consumes less fuel in transport), but often costs more. There are real market forces exerting pressure upon businesses to provide less polluting services. It isn't clear that regulatory forces are being very successful (among other examples, Kyoto Protocol has failed miserably to achieve a meaningful shift).<p>
Enron wasn't rational, as evidenced by committing wide-scale fraud. They were in a euphoric panic, simultaneously high off of their success and panicked that they could not maintain it. Their cavalier disregard to legality and honesty destroyed their company, and even without a governmental body to enforce regulations it seems inevitable that the gathering weight of their deception would have swallowed them whole. They pretended to have resources that didn't exist, and eventually consumers would have been awakened to this truth via a catastrophic failure of one sort or another: the existing government regulation certainly did nothing to curtail the financial pandemic that Enron's bloated corpse transmitted to America's economy.<p>
You have a solid point, that we often don't like which actions are rewarded in life, and that it often seems like government regulation can improve on the allotments of resources: that an organization can compensate for the flawed actions of humans.<p>
This is why we now have organizations (UN) that supervise organizations (countries) that supervise organizations (pronvinces) that supervise organizations (municipal districts), that supervise people. I always thought the idea was to build layers of abstraction on top of <i>working</i> components. Somehow stacking layers of flawed implementations has always seemed to magnify and obfuscate flaws rather than compensate for them.",1183665699

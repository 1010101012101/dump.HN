Not every AGPS device can map radio signals to a lat-long; some can only do that with assistance.<p>It also lists some ways that various implementations require assistance:<p>Assistance falls into two categories:<p>Information used to more quickly acquire satellites<p>It can supply orbital data or almanac for the GPS satellites to the GPS receiver, enabling the GPS receiver to lock to the satellites more rapidly in some cases.<p>The network can provide precise time.<p>The device captures a snapshot of the GPS signal, with approximate time, for the server to later process into a position.<p>Accurate, surveyed coordinates for the cell site towers allow better knowledge of local ionospheric conditions and other conditions affecting the GPS signal than the GPS receiver alone, enabling more precise calculation of position.

Although a hashing technique for dealing with expiring data is known and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,121,495, issued Jun. 9, 1992, that technique is confined to linear probing and is entirely inapplicable to external chaining. The procedure shown there traverses, in reverse order, a consecutive sequence of records residing in the hash table array, continually relocating unexpired records to fill gaps left by the removal of expired ones.<p>Unlike arrays, linked lists leave no gaps when items from it are removed, and furthermore it is not possible to efficiently traverse a singly linked list in reverse order. There are significant advantages to external chaining over linear probing that sometimes make it the method of choice, as discussed in considerable detail in the aforementioned texts, and so hashing techniques for dealing with expiring data that do not use external chaining prove wholly inadequate for certain applications. For example, if the data records are large, considerable memory can be saved using external chaining instead of linear probing. Accordingly, there is a need to develop hashing techniques for external chaining with expiring data. The methods of the above-mentioned patent are limited to arrays and cannot be used with linked lists due to the significant difference in the organization of the computer's memory.""<p>The triviality of the patent should be fairly evident (but if I've jumped to a bad conclusion, I'm happy to be corrected).

Because that's not the case there. Both functions remain perfectly compatible with client applications -- unless those apps are buggy themselves.<p>What got changed was an implementation detail -- order of bytes copying. Think of it as of a private member or method of an object, if you're an OOP head. <i>Must</i> be untouchable by outer code, and the outer code <i>must not</i> rely on its internal behavior.<p>Certain applications were making a silent assumption about the internal workings of the function -- and they used the wrong function. Working around that is not keeping binary compatibility; that's promoting bugs. [0]<p><i>> If you're going to change it, add a new function.</i><p>That's the <i>current</i> state of affairs. The memmove(3) vs. memcpy(3) distinction was created decades ago for this very reason. memcpy(3) may take extra optimization, because it makes no assumption about relation of source & target memory regions. memmove(3) may be easier to use, because it performs the right thing if the source & target memory overlap. The developer picks either. There's no other difference between them -- especially in the API. The best thing is, replacing one with another takes nothing -- you just change function name; arguments are exactly the same. Perhaps for the very reason of ease of replacing one with another.<p>From the man pages:<p><pre><code>  The  memmove()  function  copies  n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.  The memory areas may overlap:\n\n  The  memcpy()  function  copies  n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.  The memory areas must not overlap.\n</code></pre>\nSee? Nothing confusing there.<p>----<p>[0] A few years ago everybody and their brother were deriding Microsoft for pushing hacks into Windows XP to remain backward compatible with selected application -- like memory allocation workaround for the SimCity game. They did unsound engineering for business reasons -- increasing adoption rate of Windows XP. Now don't ask us to backpedal on that, and push bug compatibility into opensourece software. Don't ask for cart before the horse -- Flash Player before any non-buggy program. Don't ask Linux to follow in every footstep of Microsoft -- let's learn from mistakes.<p>(a note about that SimCity matter is here: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html</a> )<p>EDIT:<p>please also note, the memcpy(3) and memmove(3) functions aren't glibc's invention. They aren't specific to GNU, Linux or glibc. You'll find the functions in every modern UNIX and similar OS, no matter if based on glibc or some other system libraries.<p>Again, from the man page:<p><pre><code>  CONFORMING TO\n       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.</code></pre>",1303411377

However, Amazon's EBS system is one of the more failure-prone components of the AWS infrastructure, and lies at the heart of this morning's outage [1]. Any steps you can take to reduce your dependence upon a service that is both critical to operation and failure-prone will limit the surface of your vulnerability to such outages. While the snapshotting ability of EBS is nice, waking up to a buzzing pager to find that half of the EBS volumes in your cluster have dropped out, hosing each of the striped RAID arrays you've set up to achieve reasonable IO throughput, is not. Instead, consider using the ephemeral drives of your EC2 instances, switching to a non-snapshot-based backup strategy, and replicating data to other instances and AZ's to improve resilience.<p>The author also recommends Elastic Load Balancers to distribute load across services in multiple availability zones. Load balancing across availability zones is excellent advice in principle, but still succumbs to the problem above in the instance of EBS unavailability: ELB instances are also backed by Amazon's EBS infrastructure. ELB's can be excellent day-to-day and provide some great monitoring and introspection. However, having a quick chef script to spin up an Nginx or HAProxy balancer and flipping DNS could save your bacon in the event of an outage that also affected ELBs, like today.<p>With each service provider incident, you learn more about your availability, dependencies, and assumptions, along with what must improve. Proportional investment following each incident should reduce the impact of subsequent provider issues. Naming and shaming providers in angry Twitter posts will not solve your problem, and it most certainly won't solve your users' problem. Owning your availability by taking concrete steps following each outage to analyze what went down and why, mitigating your exposure to these factors, and measuring your progress during the next incident will. It is exciting to see these investments pay off.<p>Some of these:<p>– <i>Painfully</i> thorough monitoring of every subsystem of every component of your infrastructure. When you get paged, it's good to know <i>exactly</i> what's having issues rather than checking each manually in blind suspicion.<p>– Threshold-based alerting.<p>– Keeping failover for all systems as automated, quick, and transparent as is reasonably possible.<p>– Spreading your systems across multiple availability zones and regions, with the ideal goal of being able to lose an entire AZ/region without a complete production outage.<p>– Team operational reviews and incident analysis that expose the root cause of an issue, but also spider out across your system's dependencies to preemptively identify other components which are vulnerable to the same sort of problem.<p>---<p>[1] See the response from AWS in the first reply here: <a href=""https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=239106&tstart=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=239106&#...</a>",1303409628

It of course does require the reader to reflect intelligently while reading, but that is what we expect in this forum.  Since my final three grafs made my position pretty clear, I was rather unsure until your response below whether you were intentionally trolling.<p>[1] My statements are likely true, paradoxically, but we react strongly to the fact that they <i>shouldn't</i> be.",1260597599

You don't need to have further forms or any other input. Just the list of account numbers, educated guesses about filenames like resume.pdf or resume.doc, then digging out info from such filenames, then social engg techniques, etc. could cause enough havoc to the individual. The same line of arguments can be applied to businesses as well.<p>Plus, anyone who has read my post properly (than asking me to read the comments here properly) can understand that I never said that their security is weak. I only told that their approach to resource enumeration offers an easy way for hackers to get started. I am not sure if you understand the argument I am making here from a purely security point of view. But, if you are familiar, I invite you to think along these lines and see if it is a good practice to have this kind of sequential naming system.<p>PS: Regd you second paragraph, I don't respond to childish talk. If you restrain and talk like an adult, I am happy to discuss this issue. This is not about me or you or Dropbox people, it is about possible issues such an approach can cause and its impact on cloud computing, in general.

991221,comment,990567,991102,0,0,thwarted,,,"Then why work for ""them""?  Are there really that many IT workers who work for large organization who pay by the hour and screw them over?  Is this some kind of IT assembly line?  At every company I've worked at that had an IT department, we were an extremely small percentage of the employees or management didn't want to dedicate resources to something that they didn't perceive was core to the business or the company's core competency (either because the IT group was really good and there was no need for more people, or because management didn't see the value in more technical bandwidth).<p>The last thing I want is to be considered a scab because I know what I'm worth and am willing to work for someone who recognizes that but doesn't recognize collective bargaining.  It's not like technology positions require a huge capital investment, in things like factories or real estate (thus reducing worker mobility), and the workers are largely interchangeable cogs (we're not, no matter what management would wish).  If a company wants to replace me with someone cheaper in order to save money, well, I'm not sure that's a place I want to work anyway.  And if they can find someone just as good as me who is willing to takes less, well, that's just good business (meaning: I can't really fault them for doing the same thing I would) -- maybe then I'd need to sell myself better.<p>From the OP: <i>In some cases it works out that way. But in many cases, years of 60-hour weeks and taking classes on your own dime to keep up with technology leave you in the unemployment line, after being laid off with no notice.</i><p>I don't know many technology workers who are laid off without notice for reasons other than the company being in dire straights anyway.  And this is often bad management (yuck!), or an unsustainable business (equally bad).<p>Companies I've worked that had ""continuing education"" options were usually along the lines of certifications, which were mainly about being able to charge more for my work to clients because I was certified -- after all, they're running a business here, not putting people through school.  And even if you are paying for taking classes out of your own pocket, they only serves to INCREASE your marketability if you get laid off, so taking classes or learning on your own is in your own best interest anyway.  Paying for it yourself means you aren't beholden to the company either.<p>Admittedly, the OP is talking about <i>contract</i> work as the form of hourly work.  How many people get hired for contract work that collective bargaining at a single company would make a difference?  Contractors are usually in for temporary (time limited) work anyway, which is not ""being fired"" unexpectedly.",1260595923

Sure, in a magical happy world it would be great to offer children in Africa free AIDS medicine, but the fact of the matter is that millions of dollars go into getting a drug like that to market. It takes millions of dollars of research, millions of dollars to go through clinical trials, millions of dollars to go through FDA approvals, etc. And ultimately most drugs are very simple chemical compounds that could be easily synthesized in retrospect with the most basic of equipment.<p>While it's certainly bad for companies to exploit the patent system and try to extort profit out of sick and dying people, that does not justify throwing out the protection altogether.<p>If we threw out the patent system, none of the drug companies would spend the millions of dollars required to create things like a cure for AIDS as they would not make that money back because the next guy would just do some simple chromatography and have the same chemical compound synthesized for a fraction of the cost. What company is going to go tens of millions of dollars in debt with no hope of making that money back? When the incentive to do research is gone, we have no AIDS cure at all and in my opinion a world with no AIDS cure is worse than a world with an AIDS cure that's a bit expensive.<p>There are many things that are broken with the patent system for sure, but throwing it out completely would cause many things to fall apart and cause catastrophic damage.",1260594009

And since better mobile performance and behavior is what developing world Internet clients most need from a new protocol, many of their concerns are being explicitly addressed.<p>As for whether &quot;shaving a couple of bytes off of a header&quot; makes a practical difference, you should consider the &quot;Why do we need header compression?&quot; answer here: <a href=""http://http2.github.io/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http2.github.io/faq/</a> which references concrete evidence provided by an HTTP2 advocate. Personally, I find that more convincing than your apparently unsupported assertion.<p>Separately, it&#x27;s nice to say websites should drop the eye candy and the Javascript frameworks (the hundreds of requests is addressed by HTTP2 multiplexing, I believe), but that&#x27;s missing the point. As has been repeatedly demonstrated since the earliest days of WAP, mobile users don&#x27;t want a stripped-down subset of the Internet, they want as much as they can get. From that perspective, raising the bar on what&#x27;s possible (as HTTP2 tries to do) moves the ball far more than trying to convince websites to fit themselves into today&#x27;s constraints (especially since the mobile user in the developing world has one of the strictest versions of those constraints).",1420170927

Twelve years after learning to program, I looked back on all my software: none of it was finished, and what was, wasn’t ambitious enough. The projects that started out ambitiously always seemed to fall back to earth, like failed rockets lacking the power to propel their own weight into orbit. Sure, there were interesting ideas in there, lots of wacky toys, and I had even attempted a few large projects, but none of them ever came together like the cool games and software I had always admired.<p>Sure, I had become a pretty good programmer, and learned to make cool stuff, but clearly none of it would ever amount to anything. I just didn’t have what it took.<p>I went to graduate school at Georgia Tech, and read some Chris Crawford. I learned that he had the same problem. But he didn’t think of it as failure. For him, this was an organic part of the development process. The failures filling his hard drive were actually “prototypes” that helped him decide which ideas were worth pursuing. For each good idea, there were a large number of stupid ones that didn’t work out. Failing, for this successful designer, was a way to find the good ideas. The revelation hit me like a ton of bricks. Maybe I had a chance after all... Master artists like Escher or Van Gogh don’t just sit down and crank out a finished piece. Artists create numerous sketches and studies before they undertake finished paintings, let alone masterpieces... All of my software failures, which I was now thinking about as prototypes, sketches, and studies, had taught me a thing or two about design and programming. If you want to learn to draw, you have to make a ton of bad drawings first. The difference between practice and failure is simply a matter of attitude.&quot;<p>These ideas are, of course, not new, but Gingold has thought about them deeply and distilled them sharply.  The essay as a whole goes much further than the above excerpt, and is well worth reading.",1420170025

There was an article a few days ago on HN about the mathematician who came up with the design for the math portion of Common Core.<p>I think these people are completely missing the point.  The focus should be on <i>how to teach</i>, not necessarily on <i>what</i> is being taught.  My sister is a teacher.  She has taught at some of the worst schools in the state (1,000/1,100) and is just now beginning at one of the best schools.  The problem isn&#x27;t the math itself; it is how the math is taught.<p>For some reason everyone in society feels compelled to voice their opinion on how things should be done in education.  This is absurd.  Would the average person dare tell a nuclear engineer how he should be designing his reactor?  Would they pretend to argue about the airflow over an aircraft wing?  Would they tell me I&#x27;m using the wrong Hamiltonian in my QM simulations?  No, of course not.  They have absolutely no expertise and no experience in the field.  Similarly, the vast majority of <i>everyone</i> has no experience whatsoever teaching thousands of very different students from different backgrounds with very different learning styles and needs.  So why then does everyone feel like they have the capacity to decide what the best education system is?<p>Most people recall going to school themselves when they were younger, and they know what learning strategy worked best for them, and then they project this learning style onto everyone else.  That&#x27;s not going to work.  Does that mathematician who helped designed the Common Core standards have any experience working with a class where 97% of the students are on free lunches and their parents are in jail and addicted to cocaine?  Of course not; his daughter goes to an upper-class school.  Her situation is completely different.",1420169615

Mathematicians are fond of saying that mathematics is like swimming--you can only learn it by doing.<p>I can cheerfully damn the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics with the faint praise that they are generally better than the previously existing curriculum frameworks in most states of the United States.[2] I have lived in other countries, and I know that mathematics education can be done far better than it is done in the United States.[3] Keith Devlin is certainly correct that young mathematics learners must learn to work exploratively with challenging problems that cause them to think and wonder about what they are doing rather than merely memorizing thoughtless procedures.<p>It is also crucially important that elementary school teachers be trained and equipped to teach mathematics well, as lousy mathematics instruction in early childhood is an especially strong factor that keeps many American pupils poor.[4] Right now many families are doomed to low incomes and thus low upward social mobility by how their children are instructed in mathematics in elementary school.<p>[1] The nonprofit organization that organizes the classes I teach provides some details about the classes.<p><a href=""http://ecae.net/math1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecae.net/math1/</a><p><a href=""http://ecae.net/math2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecae.net/math2/</a><p><a href=""http://ecae.net/math1/orientation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecae.net/math1/orientation/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://educationnext.org/files/ednext_20123_Forum.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/files/ednext_20123_Forum.pdf</a><p>[3] &quot;Good intentions are not enough&quot; by Richard Askey<p><a href=""http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf</a><p>Review by Roger Howe of <i>Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics</i> by Liping Ma<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf</a><p>&quot;Word Problems in Russian and America&quot; by Andrei Toom<p><a href=""http://toomandre.com/travel/sweden05/WP-SWEDEN-NEW.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toomandre.com/travel/sweden05/WP-SWEDEN-NEW.pdf</a><p>[4] &quot;Racial Equity Requires Teaching Elementary School Teachers More Mathematics&quot; by Patricia Clark Kenschaft<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a>",1420168966

My second one got me thinking about what I really wanted for my life, and so I started educating myself and devoured hundreds of books.  Also, books let you &quot;escape&quot;, if only briefly, the stark reality of prison.  Quite a few guys I knew loved to read romance novels.<p>What Imaginenore said, about having one TV for a group is very true for every prison I was in (6 state and 3 federal).  That makes it difficult to find a program you like.<p>Usually, an ethnic group or gang takes over the TV and everyone else does their own thing.  I DM&#x27;d D&D games for 4 different groups each week, and played in one.<p>Two things that disbelief stated above were absolutely untrue about things prisoners do: stare at walls and walk in circles.

In prison, there is always something to do.<p>People can exercise with weight equipment. there is a yard you can walk a track in, play tennis in, play basketball in the courts, play soccer or touch football.<p>There is an indoor rec center with treadmills (usually), musical instruments, art room (for painting, drawing), and lots of tables for card (or D&D) playing.<p>As for book access, I found I could get any book I knew about.  The library services in the prison education department allowed us to get inter-library loan books to read.  Also, I purchased a lot of books by mail-order.<p>I subscribed to 20 different magazines of varying interest.  I did that to keep abreast of my interests, and also to pass them on to others after I finished.  I felt it important for the other inmates to expand their knowledge of subjects.  There are inmate magazine subscription services where I could get magazines at $4 to $10 per year per subscription.<p>I had internet prior to my incarceration, high speed internet at a university.

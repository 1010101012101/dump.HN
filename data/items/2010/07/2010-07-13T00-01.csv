It's such a ""90's"" thing to do, really.<p>I'm concerned about manufacturing in Third World countries, some of them supposedly being socialists, where workers in practice have no rights whatsoever and often work in terrible conditions and about regimes that partially base their power on the popularity gained within their middle classes by the economic advantages of practically making their lower classes do slave labour for western companies (as well as their own ones). I feel disgusted for owning products made in conditions like that.<p>Obviously there are exceptions as there are some well developed countries with fair societies outside the Western World as well and obviously I have no problems with purchasing products made in Japan, for example.

Special cases abound. The difference between ""column = $val"" and ""column is null"" is so painful that I just can't imagine going through that anymore.<p>And that's just the first example! What does """" mean if you save it in a db column?

I'm not arguing for Apple moving their entire manufacturing base to the US. What I'm suggesting is a US facility to (as noted in the piece) produce limited run goods. Indeed, I explicitly suggest that it be a ""technology incubator.""<p>2. I don't mention China once in the piece, and there's a reason for that. This isn't about arguing against one place, just arguing for Apple (or another, similar manufacturer) giving a piece of the game to a US facility.<p>Maybe it's feasible, maybe it's not. My argument is only that it would be a win for Apple in terms of PR and brand image, and it would be a win for wherever they did it. I'm admittedly not coming at this from a pure tech/logistics angle.<p>As for the ""wishful thinking"" comment, I'll cop to that.<p>But like I said, thanks for the feedback.

1509916,comment,1509722,1509722,0,0,pc,,,"This proposal is operationally stupid and morally dubious.<p>From an operational/supply-chain standpoint:<p>Manufacturing happens in the Pearl River Delta in China for two reasons: speed and cost. The cost is not so much a function of the cheap labour as the proximity to component suppliers and abundance of manufacturing expertise. It's easy to build electronics around Shenzhen for the same reason that it's easy to build a tech start-up in the Valley. Everything you need is around the corner.<p>For Apple, one must remember that everything they build is composed of components sourced in south-east China. As a result, US-based manufacturing would be ludicrously inefficient. Hugely increased costs, greater inventory stockpiles, completely needless carbon emissions, and lost flexibility. It's like proposing RAM on a USB stick. It's so inefficient as to be nonsensical.<p>Even if that were not the case, Apple specialize in what they're good at: implementing great software, and designing wonderful hardware to accompany it. It would be go entirely against the grain of Apple's culture of doing a small number of things well to start a huge manufacturing arm. If they wanted to increase the good they do for the US, there are vastly better ways they could go about it.<p>Next, even <i>if</i> Apple actually thought it was a good idea, they would be unable to pull it off without a lot of trial, error, and screw-ups. Foxconn is the Apple of manufacturing, and they're used by every major consumer electronics company for good reason. Apple are great at what they do after twenty years of experience, and appreciate the importance of <i>truly</i> knowing a problem-space. Manufacturing expertise is neither simple nor free.<p>Lastly, stepping aside from these operational concerns, the moral case is weak. Why do the inhabitants of Detroit deserve jobs more than those of the cities around Shenzhen? I've been to the Chinese factories that Apple uses. People like their jobs. The conditions are good. I've also seen the conditions that people who don't have jobs at Apple factories live in.<p>China is taking people out of poverty faster than any civilization ever has before. Is funding innovation centers in Detroit really a better moral cause? I don't want to turn this into a political discussion, but I believe that the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs to the US is at least not an obviously great one.",1278980175

This is plainly true: your domain object is meant to model the domain, and if you can store it directly that is the best you can hope for.  There's a reason there's a whole topic of study and research called ""Object-relational impedence mismatch"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mis...</a>)<p>However I think ORMs are too quickly dismissed.  In the simplest case, an ORM can appear to be a key-value store at the API level.  Of course that is a gross abuse of a relational store, but there's no reason it can't be done. Additionally, the author fails to note that an intelligent ORM can provide a caching layer that improves performance over raw SQL. A more detailed examination of the various patterns to resolve the impedence mismatch, such as active record versus data mapper, ORM caching strategies, and how those compare to a key-value store solution, I think would be a valuable topic of discussion.",1278979978

The reasons I hear against manufacturing in China are that the workers are slaves that make no money, and that the quality is inferior.<p>But big companies seem to have the QC down; I have lots of well-made stuff from China.  I cringe at the thought that all my IKEA furniture is made in China, but it was all perfectly manufactured and has held up wonderfully for many years.  Good design + good QA means you can get good product out of China.  (There is lots of poorly-made stuff from China, but it's poorly-made because it's rock-bottom cheap, not merely cheap.  Rock-bottom cheap stuff made anywhere is crap.)<p>The next issue is the labor one.  I ask myself, how would pulling all manufacturing out of China help the Chinese people?  $1/day buys more food than $0/day, right?  So would manufacturing stuff outside of China help the overall human condition?  Would it help <i>me</i>?  What's the advantage here?<p>Just a small data point: the $4 made-in-China shirts I buy at Target seem to be better stitched than the average $20 made-in-America shirts I buy from American Apparel.  I have had a lot of the AA shirts just completely unravel in the first wash. I always get an apology and a replacement, but I've never had a cheap Target T-shirt do this.

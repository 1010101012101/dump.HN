539030,comment,538901,538901,0,0,jeremytliles,,,"Interesting. In my experience, company leaders typically engineer discussions in order to validate what they already believe, and of course it can be a career-limiter to argue too forcefully with one's superior. I think it takes an executive with extraordinary vision to actually create a culture where dissension is encouraged and people with differing views truly engage and are fairly listened to.<p>I believe I've read somewhere that some high percentage of business leaders are classified as optimists, which probably creates a tendency to downplay the negatives of business situations. In an overall sense, this may be a good thing, as it leads people to attempt things that seem crazy to others, but it can obviously also lead to excessive risk-taking and sundry disasters.",1238443091

This person puts up with all the same b<i>s</i> that you have to put up with on your daily job.\nHe/she was smart to get into the automotive and have a great job. One because they can support their family put their kids through college so their child has more of an education then they do. (that helps out America) and their children can succeed in America and not rely on the automotive to support them. Second,because this person turns around and puts that money they made, right back into their fellow communities. Spending money so others can benefit off of their hard earn money.Thirdly, they can give to charities help out others and do good for their communities.\nSo, why does everyone bug the guy on the line....becasue he makes good money and has no education, so what!!!??<p>What about the endless managers that leave the office and go golfing on company time that are educated? Or the endless lunches that they never return from that the company has to pay for? Or how they can micro manage everything and make it twice as worse then when they started it. Or the guy who works out of his house and only puts in 3 hours of work in a day. Please give me a break!!! this is not only automotive but it is with every corporation in America! When will the educated people quite ripping off the corporation's so that the people that can't get an education can make a decent living and survive in America and enjoy the American dream!! So please quit wasting your time to find out of much the average line guy makes and start looking into your own company and start making changes!! Why do you have to have a degree to flip hamburgers?? because that is what is happening to us. Quit pointing the fingers and start seeing what every manager and salary person is doing with the company money.

539019,comment,538619,538979,0,0,brodie,,,"I believe the initial consensus was that a Python-based version control system was greatly preferred over anything else, and that for Git to be considered someone would have to show that it's much more compelling than the other systems. Git was allowed into the PEP later on, however.<p>Besides being able to say they're eating their own dog food, I think having the ability to easily extend their version control system was a factor in the choice. The Python developers would just be writing Python, after all, and Mercurial has a very simple extension system.<p>I believe Guido has had direct communication with some of the core developers of Mercurial as well, which was probably another factor. I'm not sure what Brett's DVCS usage survey had to say about Mercurial or Git, but that could also play a role in his decision.<p>Here's the original thread that led up to the PEP: <a href=""http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/98191"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/98191</a>. From what I understand, there wasn't supposed to be a lot of discussion until the PEP was written, but people couldn't help but voice their opinions on the matter. I'm guessing this is why Guido put his foot down: to prevent an endless religious debate. Hopefully the PEP will be revised with a more detailed explanation of his rationale.",1238442502
539018,story,,,1,0,PatrickAllen,"Diversifying opportunity - A coming age of the copy cat model?",,"""Don't put all your eggs in one basket."" Whether it was mom encouraging you to apply to more than one dream college or an elder discussing their positions in the market, we've all been touched somewhere along the journey by these words of wisdom. In wake of web apps like AirSet's Web Publish, I'm inclined to believe we're breaching a new wave of web businesses that will utilize aforementioned diversification to silently propel margins and profitability.<p>With access to tools like web publish, what keeps a company from developing, let's say a collaboration website specifically catered to the needs of Boy Scouts of America, bringing it to market, and all the while having their creative gurus designing templates in the same layout for Fraternities and Sororities sans a few widgets and sub a few gadgets (all available on Web publish)? Copy cat that site with one for little leagues, small business, restaurants, classrooms... rinse lather repeat.<p>Hence a web business comprised of 90% marketing and design engineers vs. the standard CS team. Systems for unparalleled customer service/retention at full throttle and all revenue driven by subscriptions for the service.<p>Participate in 2,4,6 markets. Find that only 1 or 2 hit, yet those two bankroll and justify the 4 month worth of pure web design and to market activity for the flounders. Less in one, more in many, spreading risk and overall opportunity while boosting % chance of capitalization.<p>This was all sparked after a long discussion with Brian Dougherty, CEO of AirSet, and I thought the better to bring it up for open acclaim and abuse.<p>I'm not rattling about Ning. I understand the link, but I behoove you to check out the power of AirSet's cloud computing service before drawing the correlation.",1238442460
539017,comment,538619,538891,0,0,etal,,,"The way I read it, and the document discussing the VCS switch (PEP 374), was that the Big Three DVCSes (git, hg, bzr) were essentially all just fine. Git is the fastest and hairiest, Bazaar is the slowest and cutest, and Mercurial covers both ends fairly well without introducing any glaring flaws. All three systems have big, well-known projects actively running on them, with developers singing about how much better their respective choices are compared to the SVN or CVS systems. Any choice would have been fine; it was fairly obvious.<p>Python has a history of fussy programmers. Remember the web framework wars of a few years ago? Everyone complained that there were too many choices, picked favorites to champion and nitpicked at the alternatives (which were not actually bad), and nobody could sleep at night because there were <i>alternatives</i> and nobody knew which one was <i>right</i>. Then Guido announced that Django was <i>right</i>, and the lost souls breathed a sigh of relief and did the Django tutorial, and the folks who were already using Turbogears and Pylons productively continued to do so. Django isn't necessarily the best Python web framework for everyone, but it's rarely a bad choice.<p>That's pretty much what happened this year with DVCSes. The Biopython project was stalled on a CVS-to-SVN transition for over a year, for example, until some grenades were thrown and tears were shed and finally Git was picked because a few people liked it, nobody really had a problem with it and all the other options were triggering nasty blog posts. Case closed. Sometimes we just need a quick slap to shut us up.",1238442456

538984,comment,538725,538944,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"We've bootstrapped our company since August of 08, so I can absolutely relate to the desire of wanting a healthy, low maintenance revenue stream; sometimes I'm awoken at night by nightmares of raising money. One of the reasons we are bootstrapping this is because 1) we generate cash immediately, and 2) the upside is a VERY NICE revenue stream (no dilution) if we can manage to make, maintain, and keep our place as a premium app developer.<p>This is something that takes time to build and structure for true sustainability, period. You have to plan for more than a years worth of work if you're really interested in having that type of stream from the AppStore as it matures and pollutes. There will be cases of one-hit wonders for indie shops (especially in video games) and the major blogs will cover it, but make no mistake about it — it takes work.<p>The developer who was making $10k a month is likely no longer making that amount. He also has a reputation of producing  'junk' applications by his former and future customers (star ratings mostly 1-2), and will have an extremely difficult challenge in the coming months IMHO. So in a sense, his greed and desire to cut corners has poisoned his long term sustainability.<p>My company and partners are looking at the upside of our product revenue across 3-5 years, not 3-5 months. We're maintaining 4 premium apps (+ 1 junk app), and have roughly 4 new apps we'd like to introduce this year. Our existing products have features that will take over a year to build in and mature, but we're in this for the long haul. This seems to be in line with the thought and actions of the companies that inspire us such as TapTapTap, AppCubby, Polar Bear Farm, Tapbots, Tapulous, and Smule to name a few.<p>It's two different approaches to building a revenue stream, I know our approach will last longer once it's well established.",1238441162

Coming in at eight, they never left their desks all day, eating and drinking while working. Then, at three o’clock, they marched into the men’s room and stood at the wall opposite the urinals. Dropping their pants, they bet $100 on who could train his stream the longest on the urinals across the lavatory. As their hydraulic pressure waned, the three traders waddled, pants at their ankles, across the floor, desperately trying to keep their pee on target.

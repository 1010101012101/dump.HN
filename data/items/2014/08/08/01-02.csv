We had a very similar arrangement (USR modems and all) for dial-in until we financed out and bought proper hardware, I wish I could remember the details. We hosted something like 3000 users, all their websites, shell access, Usenet, everything off of just 2 or 3 Pentiums with even fewer specs than what you describe. Everything ran quite well. We even ran a couple very high volume corporate websites for some rather famous television shows of the time off of this arrangement.<p>I&#x27;d point out that it appears even a high volume site like HN hasn&#x27;t knocked this ancient system offline.<p>It drives me nuts when I read about figuring out how to handle some couple hundred requests a second on racks full of modern hardware with <i>Gigabytes</i> of RAM.

I&#x27;m a huge advocate of using files and version control (specifically markdown and git) for published content, so I hope this workflow catches on.<p>Two improvements that are worth thinking about:<p>1) A public repository for content, separate from the main codebase.  I was excited by the inclusion of &quot;anyone&quot; in the post title, assuming that they accepted pull requests on existing content (typos, improved documentation, FAQs) from outsiders.  Turns out <i>anyone</i>, in this case, refers to anyone on the Pixlee team with access to the private repo.<p>2) Adopting the GitHub Flow [1] for content.  I didn&#x27;t see any mention of approval before publishing, which is an awesome freebie from piggybacking on git.

This is especially true of uranium bombs. Is there any case of a weapon being deployed operationally without ever being test-fired, other than dropping Little Boy over Nagasaki? That&#x27;s how simple uranium bombs are.<p>Gas centrifuges (when not being sabotaged) make uranium enrichment pretty simple, and they have been around since the &#x27;80&#x27;s as a fairly well-understood technology. There were warnings back then that they would lead to a wave of proliferation, which to an extent they have.<p>So the only plausible way Iran could have been &quot;working on&quot; nuclear weapons for 30 years without producing one is if they aren&#x27;t working very damned hard. Their economy is about half the size (GDP per capita) than the US economy was in the early &#x27;40&#x27;s but much more concentrated in terms of the state&#x27;s ability to control it.<p>So it isn&#x27;t lack of resources that is holding things up. It is most likely lack of political will: Iran would like to be seen to be working on a Bomb, but for whatever reason isn&#x27;t actually doing much toward building one. If they were, they would have one by now.<p>A team of competent high school students with a billion dollar budget could manage it in a year.<p>[Edit: this is not a defense of the theocratic monsters that run Iran, I just don&#x27;t think they are as big a nuclear threat as is commonly assumed.]",1407462082

Waiting for 6 confirmations is &quot;excellent&quot; whereas 1 confirmation is &quot;good enough&quot; (when was the last time we saw a Bitcoin double spend attempt? Never!). But arguing whether 1 confirmation is good enough is a moot point. Bitcoin competes with traditional international payment systems where it is common for transfers to post in 1-3 days especially across weekends or bank holidays (&quot;post&quot; has a specific definition, look it up). So even waiting for 6 confirmations makes Bitcoin faster than traditional systems.<p>On the other point, true, many people rely on 1 exchange, or place their coins in 1 online wallet service, which makes them vulnerable to incidents typically affecting centralized systems. But this is not a problem inherent to Bitcoin. Not at all. This is solved by educating users, by new services (eg. hardware wallets like Trezor), and by &quot;natural selection&quot; (eg. people who lost coins on MtGox tend to learn their lessons, weak exchanges die, secure ones remain in use, merchants can very easily use multiple Bitcoin processors at once, etc).",1407461351

8151017,comment,8149425,8149425,1,0,jerf,,,"It seems to me nobody has properly explained the issue, including the original article or any of the comments so far. The problem with adverbs is best viewed through the lens of information theory. In the sentence &quot;&quot;Well, I guess if you had grown up with it, you would understand polo,&quot; Minx said snobbishly.&quot;, the reason snobbishly is a useless adverb is that absent any other context, the <i>most likely</i> way in which that sentence was said was snobbishly. Yes, it is true that the sentence may not have been said snobbishly... in that case, use the adverb because it will be adding information. For instance, I can imagine that the sentence was said &quot;sweetly&quot;, in which case we are not probably in a very sarcastic context. &quot;Flatly&quot; puts another spin on it. Etc.<p>Doing an adverb search over a document is a good idea. It is something I&#x27;m doing more routinely in my larger writing work now (but not HN comments, so please spin down the hypocrisy detectors, I&#x27;m not claiming perfection here). If an adverb disappears from a sentence and the most likely meaning is unchanged, toss it out. If on the other hand it puts an <i>unexpected</i> spin on the sentence (and &quot;the degree to which something is unexpected&quot; is a reasonable short summary of what something&#x27;s information content is), it&#x27;s equally important to leave it in.<p>When your adverbs simply reinforce the already-most-likely meaning, they are visual noise. When they draw you away from it, they can breathe life into the drollest of scenes.",1407461131

Here&#x27;s how we did it:<p>When son was born, my spouse took 6 months off work whilst I continued to work full time. We were exhausted, house was a mess, lawn not mown etc. It was HARD, but we coped. Mum got to take a couple of short holidays, which helped her a lot.<p>At 6 months, Mum went back to work 2 days/week, with son attending childcare on those days. These are long days for us and son but great for his socialisation, learning etc. Mum gets to have an adult conversation and exercise her brain. House/lawn still a mess.<p>At 12 months, son started crawling. We had to learn to tidy up just to get the dangerous/breakable things out of his reach. Lawn still a mess, house is a little bit better.<p>At 2 years, son started walking (late developer, I know). He can now follow around the house as we do simple chores, but he also learned how to switch off the vacuum.<p>At 2.5 years, he is happy playing on his own just knowing that one of us is nearby. Mum & I can now tag team on weekends, she cleans whilst I sit with him or I mow the lawn whilst she reads him a story. House & lawn start to recover but we can&#x27;t take on big projects.<p>At 3 years, son is potty trained. Words cannot describe just how awesome this is: we can go places, we can do activities, we can be people again!<p>Mum still works just two days/week but also has a side business and volunteers for some committees, flexibility is still very important. Son has childcare, kindergym, swimming lessons, early learning so lots of variety and learning opportunities.

My friend has an old Fujitsu FM-7, but <i>man</i> the X1 Twin looks cool with it&#x27;s integrated PC Engine! <a href=""http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomput...</a><p>Amazingly, not a single one of these machines made it to the U.S. Commodore and Atari were simply far too dominant. Jack Tramiel even addresses keeping the Japanese out of the U.S. market as a principle concern. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gmODkpnjO0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gmODkpnjO0</a><p>Also, not a single one of these architectures lives on today. I think the FM-Towns (an <i>almost</i> PC clone) and the Sharp X68k series went on the longest. But it&#x27;s a tremendous surprise that <i>so</i> many personal computers were available, in a country that&#x27;s never really been known for personal computer ownership. Even today, the typical Japanese office space is piled full of file cabinets and paper. It&#x27;s like something right out of the 1970s and 80s. <a href=""http://www.accountant-tokyo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Japanese-Office-Space.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accountant-tokyo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/J...</a><p>All of the basic system architectures dead-ended. Most were using Z80s, which never evolved beyond the 16-bit-ish R800. 6502 variants were common, the NES ran on this, the SNES ran on a 16-bit variant 65C816. But that&#x27;s it. The X68000 series ran on the Motorola 68k chips, which as we all know dead ended with the switch to the PowerPC line (which BTW, still powers all sorts of consoles <i>today</i>). The only system which picked up on the Intel lines was the FMTowns, but architecturally deviated from normal PCs enough that it&#x27;s not compatible.<p>Japan during during and right after the bubble was <i>amazing</i>.<p><a href=""http://www.thebubblebubble.com/japan-bubble/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thebubblebubble.com/japan-bubble/</a>",1407460225

Locative and temporal adverbs are (<i>rightfully</i>) banned from formal and news writing because they&#x27;re useless or redundant at best and misleading at worst (&#x27;Yesterday, August 7, 2014, an unidentified driver crashed into a family of five heading home.&#x27; vs. &#x27;August 7, 2014: an unidentified driver crashed into a family of five at the intersection of Main St and  Governor Blvd in Albany, NY.&#x27;). In creative works, there&#x27;s more lenience, but it&#x27;s usually due to a character being the narrator or informal dialogue.<p>IMO people should use adverbs as literary scaffolding to get a thought down before later expanding on it (if expansion by the author is even necessary).",1407460203

8150972,story,,,1,2,shmerl,"How to report a problem with Google Talk to Google?",,"Recently[1] DuckDuckGo updated their XMPP server (Prosody) to the new version which makes server to server encryption mandatory. This broke federation with the Google Talk service, essentially cutting off all users who were communicating between these two services before. While the move to mandatory encryption is reasonable in this day and age, if Google won&#x27;t fix that on their end, many would lose communication with majority of their contact lists.<p>Is there any way to report this bug to Google? Since Google focuses on walled garden / non federated Hangouts now, they don&#x27;t make it easy to report anything about Google Talk to them. On the other hand they still run the service, so some maintenance should be normal to expect. Any advice how to reach Google with this problem?<p>Thanks.<p>[1]: https://duck.co/blog/xmpp-s2s",1407460057

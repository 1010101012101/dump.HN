The nice perks are only one factor - the competitiveness of the interview process must be considered as well. When my competitors, such as the guy who wrote TFA, are willing to go to fanatical lengths to do well in the interview process, it's not worth the trouble of applying.<p>In fact, with lower competitiveness among applicants at other companies, I could demand a higher salary, and then use that salary to buy gourmet food/coffee and pay for Instacart to get the same grocery delivery services you get for free at Google.

4857023,comment,4856452,4856452,11,0,firefoxman1,,,"I was reading an article in an <i>OLD</i> print magazine published in the year 1900 (probably around when that picture was taken). It spoke of the increase of college students in the U.S. and made some comments on how past countries had suffered because of too many college graduates:<p><i>""There can hardly be too large an attendance at our colleges so long as the sturdy common sense of American life keeps its balance — the common sense that forbids even an effort to make a distinct ""educated "" class which when ""educated"" is unwilling to do the common tasks at which young men must first try their mettle. In Germany there is a surplus of scholars who are worth nothing to the community. They might have been good craftsmen, but university training has left them unwilling to do the common work of the world.""</i><p>Has the U.S. lost that ""sturdy common sense"" recently? Too many degrees are handed out (a large part thanks to for-profits) to those who probably shouldn't have a degree. If they were to attend a vocational school or become an apprentice instead of college, college degrees wouldn't be watered down by those who don't even need them, meanwhile colleges would have a student body of only those fit to be there.",1354343300

The value of bringing together a large number of young, intelligent people with all kinds of interests is incredible.<p>In terms of what's wrong and suggestions for improvement, it's hard to know where to start. One big, doable change may just be more standardized testing. The price of education is simply a reflection of the fact that employers and students overvalue degrees. This leads to this perverse effect that causes people to enroll because they feel like they have to, not because they want to. The whole dynamic just seems to create an enormous amount of problems. Tying so much economic value to a college degree drives prices and attendance up and the effectiveness and true value of education down.",1354343172

One of the things that I have noticed about eBay in the past couple of years is that I just don't go there anymore.  I mean, I used to hit it a couple of times a week looking for all kids of stuff.

The benefits of Apple to the consumer market is that you don't have to know much about the insiders of the device in order to use it.

Honestly, I don't believe that girls are always only thinking socially, nice and eco-friendly, while boys dream of guns and bombs. Too bad she only presented anecdotal evidence, which makes me suspect they only saw what they wanted to see. For example, it would have been interesting to see 20 pictures drawn by girls and 20 pictures by boys, instead she only presented one each.<p>Maybe women have more choices in their work life (because they can always marry and have children, so they do not have to worry as much about their career), so they tend to choose more attractive professions (less stressful or higher social status - I hear a lot of women are becoming doctors and lawyers). That is my theory (I know it sounds a bit cynical), at least I think that is a factor. Now to me personally software development is attractive, but only so so - I like to build and create things, not necessarily the part where one sits in front of the computer all day, hardly talking to anyone.<p>Also, where are the campaigns to make more men become school teachers and kindergarden workers?",1240572824

If the article was about strictly zappos I would have had no objections. I'm happy to hear success stories too.<p>What I'm not happy to hear is scoble's agenda. What I objected to was the mudslinging on O'Reilly, for promoting an event which focuses on number of followers and promoting 140 conference where he is a speaker. When scoble itself focuses more on number of followers than community and engage in trash talking O'Reilly (and TechCrunch) for the same, I see lack of credibility.<p>What scoble cleverly tried to say is ""See, Zappos is doing great with twitter without focusing on followers.

That left England and America which became the standard.  Then England inflated, so it was down to America.  America got off the gold in standard in 1971, but there was no one else to go to.  America could then inflate its currency essentially taxing all holders of US Dollars, many of which are over seas.<p>This is the cause of the current economic problem.  By removing all ties to gold the FED was able to inflate the currency causing malinvestment & seeking risky returns to stay ahead.

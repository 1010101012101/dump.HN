As such, I suspect that those that have the most experience with startups on average tend to be below the mean in the karma pool.  Thus giving those with the most karma an additional boost in shaping the site dynamics would push the site further in the direction of ""fans of startups"" as opposed to ""people working on startups"".",1215093546

Thorp (that allow a broad choice of probability distributions) and removed the risk parameter by using put-call parity.<p>3) Option traders did not use formulas after 1973 but continued their bottom-up heuristics.<p>The Bachelier-Thorp approach is more robust (among other things) to the high impact rare event. The paper draws on historical trading methods and 19th and early 20th century references ignored by the finance literature.

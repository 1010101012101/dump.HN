5208673,comment,5207914,5207914,0,0,Terretta,,,"Part of the issue around transparency is that email inbox silos may be the wrong tool for a collaborative and productive tech company.<p>In general, email is now being seen (as often remarked by ShowHN MVPs) as To Do lists, and in a tech shop, multiple people have an interest in that process. This results in unenforceable policies about To: vs Cc: and unwieldy threads you're never sure if you should delete the tail nested indent history from.  As the ShowHN projects assert, email's a poor To Do list tracker.<p>To refine that slightly, emails tend to be <i>requests</i>.<p>You don't create a new email thread to give yourself a To Do item.  You create a new email thread to ask someone for something.  The recipient doesn't care about your agenda.  You're the interested party asking, and you need to track your requests.<p>Employees and clients email requesting action from someone: do this for me, let me do this for you, give me a resource, read this, take action on this, file this, and of course, receive a copy of this to cover my ass.  Your To Do items (emails) are now in their lists (inboxes), and once there, you've lost control over the prioritization and handling of them.  You'll probably lose visibility too, the moment you stop getting CC'd on your own email thread.<p>So, we quit using email.<p>Instead, we use Request Tracker, tracking all those requests. Instead of the Inbox, we have the RT dashboard, backed by automation with full extensibility:<p><pre><code>    http://bestpractical.com/rt/screenshots.html
    http://bestpractical.com/rt/features.html
    http://bestpractical.com/rt/extensions.html
</code></pre>
We all use it, and clients are trained (by sales, by contract, and by firm account managment and support response) to use tickets for anything as well.  If there's no ticket, you didn't really request it.  RT makes this easy, because the client can still just use email -- there's no web interface (well, there is, but they don't have to use it) for them to have to learn. They can just email a team (internally, an RT ""ticket queue"") and be sure the team will sort out who's handling it with an SLA promise.<p>If someone on a team has a family emergency, it's no issue, as anyone else on the team can take over that person's tickets till they're back, and immediately see the whole history.<p>All this is public within the company and fully searchable, going back about a decade.<p>When I said above we quit using email, I lied!<p>We actually all use email, but what we're emailing are RT tickets.  So throughout the day, we can use any email capable device in the world to interact with this shared request handling history.  RT automates the history and the cc lists.  You can search your own requests using your email client, or hit the web interface to search everything.  Through the web interface we enjoy the benefits of the dashboard summary, automatic response SLA monitoring, cross linked issue tracking, and visibility/searchability by everyone.<p>Note that RT can pick apart email addresses and subject lines, so you can route all your RT queues through a single Gmail account if you want, spam protecting your system and giving you a master archive searchable using Google's search tools as well.<p>Stripe is essentially slowly reinventing Best Practical's Request Tracker.  Might be worth giving RT a try.",1360695280

5208659,comment,5208565,5208565,1,0,patrickk,,,"Has anyone pondered what it could mean if Google hypothetically partnered with Tesla for it's initial rollout of driverless cars? Just some fun speculation on my part.<p>The advantages (in my opinion):<p>- Going driverless means a threat to existing, big car companies since there would likely be less cars needed on the road. Partnering with Tesla would sidestep that - it would allow Tesla to ramp up production of it's electric cars, and would fit nicely with Elon Musk's stated life goal of making energy consumption sustainable (along with sustainable energy generation - SolarCity, and making humanity a multi-planetary species - SpaceX).<p>- Google would get a partner that would be likely to enthusiastically embrace driverless.<p>- An investment in Tesla by Google would provide a huge cash boost to open new factories, expand it's existing factory, re-tool for new Tesla models. It would greatly aid Tesla's goal of mass producing the electric vehicle.<p>- Driverless technology gets around the initial range issues for EV batteries while the technology is new - a driverless, electric car would bring you to the office door, drop you off, and drive down to the basement to recharge itself until summoned via smartphone for the commute home.<p>- Simpler, cheaper servicing and running costs since EVs have less parts - no oil filters, radiators, gearboxes, drive trains, heavy engines (and potentially pedals, steering wheels etc if driverless). The twin technologies of electric and driverless means the cars are more reliable, as there's less parts to break, cheaper (once initial technology costs drop), lighter and greener (as the bill of materials for a driverless electric is a fraction of that of a regular 4 cylinder gasoline car). If every car on the road was electric and driverless, most/all vehicle safety equipment could be eliminated along with accidents - less weight, hence more range for lithium-ion batteries, and cheaper vehicles as less parts are needed to manufacture them.<p>- For re-fueling, EVs don't need to drive to a dedicated re-fueling spot, they can charge up in the same house/workplace/shopping center that a passenger is going to anyway.<p>Thoughts?",1360695173

Most tools they used (in our case licensed from X/PARC) had C underpinnings for performance, but ultimately consumed specifications that were very much like Prolog or Haskell in character.

5208583,comment,5185423,5190980,1,0,lutusp,,,">> Meanwhile, in psychology, virtually all ideas are excuses for debates between differing factions.<p>> I'm not aware of any serious debates against cognitive psychology.<p>That's not what I said -- read it again. I said that factions <i>within</i> psychology differ about which of them is real, is scientific. For example, clinical psychology and psychiatry famously doubt the validity of the other. But neither of them have scientific evidence to support their claims, which is why that debate goes on and on.<p>Before you make a predictable objection, remember that in real science, fields are united by theory, not divided. Genetics doesn't only guide the activities of geneticists, it unites all of biology. SO does evolution, in exactly the same way -- any evidence that either supports or casts doubt on evolution changes the entire field of biology at once. This pattern is true of all legitimate sciences -- all of them are simultaneously defined and united by their theories. It is not true of psychology, which has factions that pursue similar subjects but come to diametrically opposite conclusions, with no on noticing or caring. The reason? Everyone tries to describe, but no one tries to explain.<p>> Psychology is an intrinsically much more difficult field than physics. Comparing other fields to it is what is disingenious.<p>1. Unless you're planning to invent a new word, do look up the word ""disingenuous"".<p>2. There is precisely one kind of science. Science is not an ice cream store with dozens of flavors -- science has one flavor. Any scientific field can be compared to any other scientific field as to methods and results. When this comparison is made with psychology, psychology fails the comparison, as the more candid commentators within the field freely acknowledge (see below).<p>> Cognitive psychology is the future of psychology.<p>Yes which partly explains why psychology is being replaced by neuroscience.<p>> It is perfectly scientific ...<p>Scientific fields craft and then test falsifiable scientific theories, <i>explanations</i>. Cognitive psychology can only describe, a failing freely acknowledged by its practitioners.<p><a href=""http://www.simplypsychology.org/science-psychology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simplypsychology.org/science-psychology.html</a><p>A quote: ""Despite having a scientific methodology worked out (we think), there are further problems and arguments <i>which throw doubt onto psychology ever really being a science</i>.""<p>I could produce any number of quotes like the above, included in the papers of psychology's honest advocates and supporters, but I don't think it will make any difference -- your mind is made up and you refuse to be confused by the facts.",1360693986

5208577,comment,5207265,5208258,2,0,jfarmer,,,"As I read the article, I don't think that's what Fowler was talking about.  I think he noticed a trend in things like Less, Sass, Haml, CoffeeScript, etc.  The relationship between, say, Haml and HTML is qualitatively different than the relationship between Clojure and Java (or JVM bytecode).<p>So, it feels like something new is happening and this essay was an attempt to more precisely define an otherwise qualitative feeling.  In my reading, here's how he did it.<p>We say a compiler from language X to language Y is <i>transparent</i> when two things are true:<p>1. The compiler produces a clear and human-understandable mapping between the syntax of X and Y.  That is, given code in language X, a human could predict the compiler's output in Y.<p>2. (1) is not merely a happy accident, but a stated design goal of the compiler or underlying language X.  That is, it's not whether (1) is the case, it's whether we're guaranteed that (1) is the case.<p>It's (2) that separates ClojureScript and CoffeeScript.  Lots of compilers satisfy (1), e.g., a really nave C compiler, but it's not by design.  There's no intention, no promise to the developer, that the mapping from X -> Y has property (1).<p>For example, ClojureScript's priority is not about producing a clean mapping between Clojure and JavaScript, it's about bringing the expressiveness and power of Clojure to client-side development.  If you look at the ClojureScript example page you see lots of ""Here's how you do X in ClojureScript, but there's not native way to do X in JavaScript.""<p>If we had two ClojureScript compilers A and B, and A produced 10x faster JavaScript than B at the cost of lots of crazy optimizations, we might very well choose A.<p>It'd be a much harder call for CoffeeScript, because part of the pitch CoffeeScript makes to developers is that it's ""like JavaScript without all the bad parts.""<p>I don't necessarily agree with the above, but that's my understanding of Fowler's argument.",1360693958

This would be a disaster for Google (and arguably, the consumer), as they'd have no market power (and the switching cost for a search engine is much lower than the switching cost for a smartphone).  The introduction of Android was simply to ensure more competition in the market (in fact, back when Android phones had a hardware search button, you could find many phones that mapped it to Bing).  Android was less about making money off the product directly than about shaping the environment of the mobile industry in a manner that was less unfavorable to Google.
As another example of this strategy, see Chrome:  Performance of the dominant browsers was hindering what Google could do with their products...until an alternative was launched and both Firefox and IE magically decided that performance gains were possible, and now the state of the browser market is in much better shape than it was.<p>It's more than a little shocking that so few people seem to understand these concepts.  You still see articles (whether from Wall St or the online tech community) about how Android makes X dollars in revenue, as measured in AdMob revenue from Android phones and Google Play revenue.

Giving users a procedural programming language is only going to help a small number of Excels users - the ones who like thinking in a procedural way.<p>For me, the real pain point in Excel's formula language is in how the path of least resistance leads you towards unmaintainable code.

Obviously it's noise to me because I'm completely disconnected from that world. I definitely agree that we're growing into a world where there is a heck of a lot more noise, in fact compared to the 90s I'd say it's pretty deafening these days. I hope that people have become smarter consumers of media and discussion to cope with this, to be able to spot obvious spin and hopefully see through it.<p>But as we grow used to the noise around us I wonder if there's still a place for a disruptive technology that filters noise and provides us only with signal. Would users feel as though they're missing out? Would the quiet make them feel unsettled?",1299142520
2283360,comment,2282894,2283230,0,0,ryannielsen,,,"Shoddy at best? iPad 2 ships on the 11th, with an enormous portfolio of apps. Do you think that's worth nothing?<p>I'm betting the average consumer cares about four things:<p>- How the product feels in the store. (Is it solid and how responsive is it?)<p>- What they can do with it. (What apps can I run?)<p>- Who's recommending the product. (What does the NYT say? What do my friends say?)<p>- Price. (Can I afford this?)<p>On which of those things does Xoom beat iPad or iPad 2? Who will walk into a store and see the Xoom next to an iPad or iPad 2 and say: I'm gonna buy the Xoom, even though it costs more, doesn't run the apps my friends are talking about, and isn't recommended by anyone I know! Hell, I'll go out on a limb and just guess, since I've held neither a Xoom or iPad 2, that the iPad 2 feels better in my hands. Past performance being a future predictor, I bet Apple nailed that experience.<p>So, given that, is the argument that there's only 16 apps shoddy? By your post, it's an argument that there's no unique content for Honeycomb for the next 6 months – that there's no unique content vs. iPad <i>or</i> iPad 2 for the next 6 months. And don't forget that those 6 months are not a vacuum of development for either Apple or 3rd party devs. Apple's likely to announce a new iOS release, and there will be tens of thousands of new, unique apps posted to the iOS App Store.<p>I think that's a pretty solid argument against Xoom, especially since Xoom loses on every other factor (I think consumers care about) right off the bat.",1299142506

2283265,comment,2280051,2282268,0,0,mitcheme,,,"It would be so much more useful to hold happiness or quality of life constant instead. I really don't think it's a meaningful improvement to have ten times as much material wealth if that goes along with a fifteenfold increase in the amount of material wealth you think you ""need"", especially if that goes along with increased workload, stress, responsibility, etc., and decreased leisure time, time with family, health, etc. To most westerners it seems obvious that a nice house and your pick of hundreds of mates will make you happier, but that's just because it's how we grew up. If we packed it up and tried to go hunter-gatherer tomorrow, we would fail miserably and be miserable doing it -- but that's what exactly happens when hunter-gatherer societies and agricultural societies suddenly go western. Either way it takes several generations to adjust, so the fact that you wouldn't feel comfortable living as a hunter-gatherer, now that you've already been raised in this culture, doesn't have anything at all to do with which lifestyle is better. Even your ""objective"" measurement made a value judgment that meshes with industrial, not hunter-gatherer, societies. Of course an industrial society will do better by industrial standards.<p>Being a hunter-gatherer born in a stable hunter-gatherer society is not at all the same as being a homeless person in the industrialized world. For the most part hunter-gatherers in a hunter-gatherer society aren't ostracized or looked down on by everyone they know, criminalized/shamed for living (finding ""acceptable"" opportunities to sleep, eat, piss, etc, are much more difficult for a homeless person), or surrounded by messages that a person's worth is measured by whether they own the right things. Being able to comfortably meet biological needs, having meaningful social connections, retaining dignity and self-respect -- these things mean a lot.'N!ai, the Story of a !Kung Woman' is an interesting documentary about a woman whose life took a dramatic turn for the worse after the introduction of western culture, even though she probably ended up being the richest person in her tribe.<p>AFAICT more technology has nearly always led to us taking up different kinds of work to fill up that time, not more leisure. When modern household appliances were introduced, the result was higher standards for housekeeping. Women in the 70's spent slightly more time doing housework than women in the 20's did despite all the new ""conveniences"". Were houses in the 20's disgustingly filthy? No. Did the increase in cleanliness make society as a whole happier or better off? I doubt it. If anything, I suspect the obsession with cleanliness has just contributed to increased rates in allergies, weaker immune systems, etc.  Technically, access to these appliances are considered a standard of living increase, but all it really did was make us pickier about what an ""acceptable"" living is. Now people who can't afford those conveniences have to work harder to keep up or be shamed by others for having a ""dirty"" house.<p>People comparing themselves to others is very relevant, because those comparisons have a huge impact on happiness and quality of life, and it is generally assumed that a higher standard of living correlates with those things. (If you disagree, can you explain why having a higher standard of living is a good thing? Why is it rising? Why do we even care about it?) If that's a wrong assumption it needs to be challenged because from what I can tell it's basically a cornerstone of western civilization right now.",1299139614

Inside the room is a man who does not speak Chinese.  He receives paper with Chinese symbols on it, consults a vast library of books with rules on what to do in response to particular symbols, laboriously copies his response onto paper, and pushes it out through the slit.  The response is intelligible as Chinese responsive to the input Chinese.  Searle argues that the man can't understand Chinese.  Personal opinion: it's navelgazing that only matters to philosophy, but I think the man and books together constitute a system which speaks Chinese, in the same way that people bidding in an auction together constitute an efficient price discovery mechanism even if none has expert knowledge of the ""true value"" of all items at auction.)",1299139243

This updates continuously as the charge goes on. They use different protocols for this communication (which is why Tesla&#x27;s CHAdeMO adapter is $450 instead of a simple piece of plastic and dumb metal) but neither one is very specific to the battery pack or other electronics.<p>One wrinkle is that the charger has to be able to put out enough voltage to actually charge the battery. There are some rumbles about future cars with 800V packs to improve charging speeds, which would make them incompatible with these chargers. But all current and near-future cars could potentially use all current fast-charging standards with an adapter, or with a bit of engineering effort to build in a port.",1453049974

Github provides a potential blind audition scenario - don&#x27;t mention your race or age or gender or weight or anything else. Just submit code and prove yourself. Yet, diversity advocates generally see this as not helping minorities in tech.<p>2. Tech companies constantly publish their diversity stats. They are trying to hire more women and minorities, and are motivated to do so. Blind auditions tend to help in industries where the opposite is true.<p>Still, I&#x27;d love to see a source for your claim, and I&#x27;d be happy to be convinced otherwise.<p>Regarding the one link you do provide: The headline figure is meaningless without some more data on the survey - such as how was the survey conducted, and is it random.

You really have to go further and explicitly sandbox a potentially malicious program.</i><p>Definitely. But I think the trust model has also changed over the years. We have gone from trusting a handful of well-vetted programs (10-15 years ago I primarily used a browser, Pine, CenterICQ and a handful of traditional UNIX utilities) to more and more programs that are all newer and typically connect to the net, embed browsers, etc. Consequently, we should trust our applications less.<p>As you say, you really have to sandbox each program. Apple has pushed this quite hard: applications have UI isolation and App Store applications are sandboxed. In the meanwhile, much of the Linux community has been outright hostile to this idea (except the SELinux, AppArmor, and systemd folks) because it builds walled gardens and applications are provided by trusted distributors anyway.<p>The reality is that people want to install applications outside what is provided in the distro repos. And perhaps, we don&#x27;t even want to trust every possible application packaged in a distribution.<p>We should really go to a small and trusted core operating systems where everything else is sandboxed by default.",1453049169

However, I think this is obligatory, if a bit obvious:<p>> &quot;If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?&quot;<p>You know who :) George also wrote this ( <a href=""http://www.openculture.com/2014/01/george-orwell-explains-in-a-revealing-1944-letter-why-hed-write-1984.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openculture.com/2014/01/george-orwell-explains-in...</a> )<p>> Already history has in a sense ceased to exist, ie. there is no such thing as a history of our own times which could be universally accepted, and the exact sciences are endangered as soon as military necessity ceases to keep people up to the mark. Hitler can say that the Jews started the war, and if he survives that will become official history. He can’t say that two and two are five, because for the purposes of, say, ballistics they have to make four. But if the sort of world that I am afraid of arrives, a world of two or three great superstates which are unable to conquer one another, two and two could become five if the fuhrer wished it. That, so far as I can see, is the direction in which we are actually moving, though, of course, the process is reversible.<p>Remember, you don&#x27;t have to convince everybody. You have to convince (or force, or brainwash by force) a few million people, and then you simply need weapons and robots to slaughter all the rest. We have no serious safeguards against this, it would require <i>everybody</i> to be able to think critically, to be able to choose their jobs freely, and other things we don&#x27;t have (not for <i>everybody</i>). I&#x27;d wager we have more than few million people who&#x27;d be up for it, given half a chance and one order, and given current trends, I&#x27;m fully expecting a big purge &quot;at some point&quot; (even in 500 years it would be like it happening tomorrow, compared to the near-infinite empire that might follow it) that might make Stalin and Hitler look like choir boys. Pessimistic, sure, paranoid, we&#x27;ll see, and I guess off-topic for sure. But alas, it&#x27;s the one fear in my heart. We tend to take the best people in their brightest moments as the standard, instead of thinking of it like security: it&#x27;s the weakest links that really matter.

You can have a situation where the past matches the present with 99% accuracy, but that 1% makes a huge difference in outcomes. This is related to chaos theory, where small perturbations in the initial conditions can cause the evolution of the system to change dramatically.  Many people lost money shorting Amazon and Facebook stock between 2012-2015 on the belief that we are in another tech bubble, and while there are many similarities between 2000 and now (such as high stock prices) there are some subtle differences, too, such as better fundamentals. And those subtleties make the difference between a profitable trade and losing your shirt. Or another example, may people got burned betting against the stock market recovery, since 2009, believing that there would be a double dip recession, that there would be a &#x27;Great Depression&#x27;, or that America would become Japan 2.0, when, in fact, neither happened despite the many similarities.

Now if, say, someone were pointing a gun at me, my greatest emotion would be fear for how it would hurt them.<p>Fear of death is just a piece of hard coded programming to make sure we successfully reproduce and raise healthy offspring. It&#x27;s not an intrinsic part of being sentient or conscious. It&#x27;s possible that intelligences that reproduced in some other way would lack it entirely, e.g. AIs that explicitly create their offspring or hive like aliens. For ants only the queen might fear death, and we indeed see ants behaving this way.<p>I think this explains why radical life extension tech is underfunded. Even being a billionaire doesn&#x27;t change this. Bill Gates has kids.",1453046412

Simultaneously they are being fairly inflexible at fixing those mistakes and ultimately forcing abandonment, at least by dougwilson. My prediction:<p>1) IBM continues with the typical corporate policies which are probably not great for the sort of OSS project that involves independent contributors<p>2) dougwilson leaves permanently<p>3) the project sort of wallows a bit<p>4) IBM puts some resources on it, and claims it all worked out.<p>As to #4, they&#x27;ll be sort of correct, assuming the goal was to see resources and progress on express. They&#x27;ll be wrong if the goal was to properly maintain an open source community around the project.<p>NOTE: I don&#x27;t know anything about this, but I&#x27;ve seen this play out many times before. I chimed in here because the other comments in this thread seem to be wildly off topic given the content of the github discussion.",1453046405

It's pretty clear that Facebook is winning there, and may very well be the only game in town.  Let's take these stats again in six months and see where we are.<p>(I say this not even using Facebook very much, but it's pretty clear that the demographics and momentum favor it.)",1185231243
36218,comment,36152,36152,0,0,staunch,,,"It's an exciting idea because it has that magic ""Why didn't anyone do this before"" feel to it. That's always a good sign. Good luck. I haven't had any coffee yet but I totally missed the voting thumbs on the left, and I was looking for them. Not sure if that's good or bad though. ",1185230998

36210,comment,36132,36194,0,0,dhouston,,,"maybe i'm getting trolled here :) but i don't see how joel's background makes his points less relevant:\n- it's easier to fix problems on sketches/paper than in code weeks later\n- specs cut down on amount of communication needed -- especially with outside stakeholders \n- and help with schedule estimates, etc.<p>sure, in your typical web 2.0 app, many things are easy to re-work, but others (e.g. end-to-end unicode support/other i18n issues, scaling, schema design, etc.) are better baked in from the beginning (just ask friendster.) or at least be cognizant of the tradeoffs you're making and budget time to throw away your prototype.<p>also, google and ms have pretty rigorous software engineering processes and tools (hell, they hired GvR just to write a code review tool.) sure, in the early days it was probably looser. but not zero structure whatsoever -- the total free-for-all that ""just do it"" implies -- hell, even ""release early and often"" is a kind of software engineering discipline.<p>there are benefits to cutting corners (i.e. the zero planning implied by ""just do it"") like getting to market faster for certain kinds of startups (early market feedback, etc.) but these come at a cost later on! i like dharmesh shah's idea of 'technology debt': <p><a href=""http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/165/Development-Short-Cuts-Are-Not-Free-Understanding-Technology-Debt.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/165/Development-Sh...</a><p>and your assertion that QA is something that happens only after a product already exists is equally misguided -- you can save a lot of time overall by thinking early about how to structure and instrument your code to make it easy to test.<p>if your response is 'well of COURSE you'd think about all these things up front', then that's not really 'just do it', is it :)",1185229036

36207,comment,36152,36200,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"So, what you're saying is ""Who would want to be rewarded based on performance, given that some people won't perform well?"" I guess I might be irate if I said ""Let my customers tell me how good my ads are,"" and the answer was ""They suck,"" but wouldn't I be better off knowing, or at least having the option to know?",1185228267
36206,comment,36139,36139,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Loved the article, though I have to wonder how useful this ""Founders at Home"" stuff is -- I read all the time, as do most of my friends, but most of my more entrepreneurial acquaintances don't have the time. It isn't stated in the article, but having a huge library is probably something you should do either before you start or after you sell out.",1185228138
36205,comment,36152,36152,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"I wonder when people are going to get it. We have been talking about ""IN-vertising"" for ever but NO, NO, NO. We still want to guess what the user wants. No software can tell what a user wants better than the user him/herself. I believe we should spend more time and resources providing users with services that let the user initially decide  the ads they want. For me send anything that rhymes with coffee, mobility, startups and thick women. Block the other ads. If I feel like buying a car in the next few weeks, then let me pull the firefox or IE plugin and tell it to serve me a few VW Golf ads and listings. Would it be hard to build such a plugin?

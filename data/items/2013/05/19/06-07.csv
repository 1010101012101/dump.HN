It means avoiding sounding like a PR drone, blatant lies, and avoiding coming across too arrogant.<p>The Harrelson AMA seems to have blown up because a few of his responses were pretty much interpreted by Reddit users as ""I am above you peons, be honoured I'm spending time on talking to you about Rampart. Did I mention Rampart? Oh, and Rampart"". Which is a bit like walking up to a wild animal and kicking it in the nuts. That it seemed like a PR effort in a setting like an AMA where people <i>expect</i> something else but are also quite wary about the intrusion of marketeers made it doubly bad - ads are different, we know their purpose is to sell a product, and so merely trying to sell the product won't cause a stink, whereas the first time Harrelson tried to steer the conversation to Rampart, he'd already made a grave mistake.<p>I'd think for advertising on Reddit, a limited run asking for <i>feedback</i>, and being responsive and friendly in comments would be a good start.",1368946374

5732091,comment,5731164,5731839,3,0,ww520,,,"I think one of the problems of most Haskell tutorials for beginners is assuming well known facts or knowledge in Haskell is also known to the readers, which is a pretty wrong assumption.  Haskell has its own set of vocabulary that first timers would have difficult to grasp.<p>A simple example in the blog, it talks about Just 2 or Just a but don't explain what Just is.  Also 'a' as a parameter for type is not explained.  Leaving the readers to wonder whether a is argument to a function or it is a value since Just 2 and Just a are mentioned in the same section.<p>Also a lot of tutorials are afraid to draw parallel concepts from other languages that would be familiar with the readers, instead preferring to invent abstract definition to build things up.  Most people learn by relating and inferring from familiar concepts.<p>E.g. Functor is just like template in C++ for constructing type.  As a template it has placeholders to let the programmer to fill in to build a concrete type.  These placeholders are the parameters to the functor.  The programmer supplies a type as the parameter to the functor to construct a concrete type.  E.g.  ""List a"" is a functor which is called List and its parameter is a.  ""List int"" would build a concrete type for values of list of int.<p>Maybe and Just are not a good introduction functor for beginners.  Few other languages have a similar concept and people just roll their eyes when they learn what it is since it's not as useful in general.<p>List is a better introduction to functor.  Most programmers have work with List and know what it is and its problems relating to its element type.  Seeing ""List int"" people immediately know it's defining a list of int, and they know right the way what functor is and what it is for.  Doing a couple more examples of List float, List string, and people will see why functor is very useful.  May be adding Tree or some other functor operator like Eq or Show to how to have generic behaviors applying to any types.",1368946223

5732068,comment,5731366,5731869,3,0,ealloc,,,"At some point you _do_ have to use floating point (the whole point of numeric computations is to do things you can't do symbolically), however, this project might enable judicous use of symbolic manipulation in coordination with floating point. Holding off the computation until further in the program might have advantages: Automatic reordering of computations to help preserve precision, automatic symbolic manipulation to cancel out large terms, and perhaps automatic calculation of the amount of precision needed (eg if calculating ""a < b"", generate the digits of a and b until they differ). The programmer could specify exactly when symbolic manipulation is desired vs numeric.<p>The quadratic equation case he shows is pretty good. Say you want to solve ax^2 + bx + c = 0. In C you might write ""(-b + sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c))/(2 * a)"" which has all the precision problems he described. However, in his library that code would be converted to an AST, then symbolically simplified given the variable values, and _then_ evaluted numerically. The intermediate symbolic step would be able to automatically account for the edge cases, eg if c was 0, so that the numeric step wouldn't fail. In this case, the symbolic solver would recognize that (+, (sqrt, (-, ( *, b, b), 0)), b) is exactly zero before the floating point computation occurs.<p>I often write scientific programs with the issues he describes, and I have also wished for something along these lines but kind of suspect it is impossible. I usually have to play in mathematica/on paper a bit before finding an algorithm that takes care of the numeric issues (yes, even when using multiprecision), and while it would be nice for it to happen automatically, my impression is that the algorithms I find on paper are nontrivial for a computer to come up with. In some cases, however, the computer could have done it for me. But I have a feeling that in the case precision becomes an issue, even if this library gets me 90% of the way, I would still want total manual control of how the calculations occur.

And that entire cities should be underground, so that the surface could be one big green park/forest thing.<p>As I grew older, I later learned that the inability to ""turn off and on"" a nuclear fission power plant is a big problem for jurisdictions (like Ontario) where nuclear power is a major source of power. It's not uncommon for the price of power to turn negative in decentralized power markets during periods of low utilization. (It's easier to pay someone to shut off a coal/hydro/gas reactor than to shut down the reactor and then have it down for weeks before you can turn it back on again.)<p>Regarding the kid's idea, building things underground is, in and of itself, a tricky task that I'd want well-trained engineers working on. There's the risk of tunnel/shaft collapse causing death. There's also the issue of the water table and figuring out where to build it such that it doesn't contaminate the groundwater. I suspect this'll increase the cost more than he expects.<p>Then again, I also grew up being taught that CANDU reactors are way safer than most reactors in the US, which use carbon control rods (think giant thick rods of pencil lead that could catch fire), and that nobody in the US builds them simply because of cost reasons.

5732024,comment,5730690,5730690,3,0,mindcrime,,,"(Note: I'm going to put links to my own posts here, not to be blatantly self-promotional, but to illustrate points I'm talking about, since the topic of this discussion is blogging.  Feel free to ignore the links).<p>I've been blogging more than ever lately, and - FWIW - here are my observations:<p>1. Time is my biggest ""problem"" vis-a-vis blogging.  Given everything else I could be doing with that time, it's sometimes hard to prioritize writing a blog post over writing code, or any number of other things.<p>2. There's not a lot that I <i>want</i> to write about, but feel constrained <i>from</i> writing about.  We haven't had a lot of internal co-founder drama or turmoil, or any inter-personal scandals, or especially bad relationships with investors, customers, media, etc. so there isn't a whole lot that I have to restrict myself from talking about from the ""avoid upsetting people"" point-of-view.<p>3. That said, I do sometimes write a post[1] that challenges something somebody else said, or is a bit argumentative or controversial.  A good recent example was when I read a WRAL Techwire post by Joe Procopio, took it one way, and sat down to write up a testy response.  But then I emailed Joe to say ""Hey man, I read your article, and I'm thinking about posting this in response, do you have any comment first""?  He replied, clarified some points, sent some links to other works, etc., and I rewrote a big chunk of the post.  The spirit of the post remained the same, but it became less of a specific response to his article, and more of a general observation / commentary.  So no hurt feelings or conflict needed.<p>4. The blog is marketing.  Blog posts are a way to drive traffic to our site, gain search engine positioning, achieve TOMA, establish credibility, etc.<p>5. I feel that I need to stop writing about ""startup stuff"" so much, because writing about startups isn't doing anything to drive revenue for us.  It's time for us to focus on blogging stuff that will attract <i>our customers</i> to our site, by writing about: the industries we are targeting, the  executives we want to attract attention from, the kinds of problems we are working on solving, etc.  The blog is content marketing, and people who want to read about startup drama just aren't our customers.  People running plants making nonwoven technical textiles, or furniture, or farm tractors, etc., are customers. Ergo, we need to write about the nonwoven technical textiles industry, the furniture industry, or the farm tractor industry, OR something that will be relevant to people in those industries.  So, for example, if we want to get our message to CIOs, CTOs, IT Directors, etc. we write posts like this[2] and this[3].<p>6. The blog is a form of ""market education"".  So it's important for us to blog things that educate the market in a way that helps align them with what we're trying to do. We are working on incorporating a specific methodology into how we engage with customers, so we write blog posts that explain it and advocate for it.[4][5][6]<p>7. I'm not a big fan of ""newsjacking"" per-se, but if there's a topic that is ""in the news"" AND I happen to actually have a strong opinion on the topic, I like to write about it[7][8].  It's usually good for getting traffic and sometimes it leads to an interesting discussion.  And, per <i>The Cluetrain Manifesto</i> - ""markets are conversations"".<p>8. Sometimes it's cool to just have fun and post something kinda random or seemingly silly.[9]<p>9.  I wouldn't have a problem blogging about <i>some</i> aspects of our strategy, and we do strive for a high level of transparency.  Heck, we're an Open Source company, so we have to be transparent to a certain point, by definition.  But there will always be <i>some</i> secret sauce that we don't go around telling everybody.

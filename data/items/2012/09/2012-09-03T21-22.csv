Even switching workspaces sometimes took 15 seconds or so. Yes, it only has 1 GB of ram, but like I said, I used the same applications that I always did without problems.

If I were to keep my old employer's coverage through COBRA, it would be closer to the $2000/month number.

4471950,comment,4470537,4471537,6,0,tmurray,,,"You basically missed the entire point of it or why it's interesting.<p>Current Intel CPUs have a very small GPU built on to the die of the CPU. By buying the CPU, you're paying for an Intel GPU anyway.<p>At the same time, unlike CPU performance, GPU performance really does scale with die area; if you want more graphics performance, get a bigger chip with more ALUs/texture units/etc, and because graphics is so parallel everything will just go faster. However, larger chips mean larger amounts of leakage when the chip is powered but idle, which means that battery life can be significantly worse.<p>What Optimus does is allow the Intel GPU to be connected to the display hardware and be used most of the time (e.g., when you're looking at email or whatever) when high performance isn't called for. At that point, the NVIDIA GPU can be turned off completely, meaning no leakage and no battery life degradation. If you want high performance, the NVIDIA GPU is enabled on the fly, rendering is done on the NVIDIA GPU, and the final result is sent in some way to the Intel GPU, which can then use its actual display connections to put something on the LCD.<p>Prior to Optimus, there was generally a mux that would switch which GPU was outputting to the screen. This was messy because everything had to be done on one GPU or the other, it was noticeably heavyweight, occasionally required reboots, increased hardware complexity, etc.<p>The biggest issue with Optimus on Linux is that the infrastructure for the actual sharing of the rendered output didn't really exist until dmabuf appeared--you need two drivers to be able to safely share a piece of pinned system memory such that they can both DMA to/from that memory and be protected from any sort of bad behavior from each other. (I also think it's impossible to have two different drivers sharing the same X screen, which is why bumblebee works the way it does)",1346708720

Hence their quality of work would usually be lower, unless you found someone better than you for much cheaper.

I use mockups, screenshots a lot(especially since i work with english-as-a-foreign-language people). Initially i put in a lot of time QAing stuff. But i was proving to be a bottleneck where i would interact with the client, then divy up work to the devs and then QA it back. I just didn't have the hours to do all that. So i've been making clients become more involved in the process. So allowing them to help out on testing, project-management side and trying to make my presence minimal. Also all communication is kept on tickets, and linked to exact git commits for it. So i can catch up and see where we are, even drop right down to the code to see what changed.<p>To be honest, it's still a work-in-progress.

Assuming there is a hole in the wall, which is a curtain wall, not a containment wall, then it leads to work areas around and outside the base of the reactor containment vessel. The presumed hole is above the wet well and may or may not be on the side facing the containment pool.<p>If it is on the side of the containment pool, the wet well may not be covered by a floor (I have seen conflicting schematics on this). However, Unit 4's primary issues were with their spent rod pool. If that is involved, there are two concrete decks between the bottom of the pool and the space exposed by presumed hole.<p>So, my guess is the wet well may be exposed by that hole in the curtain wall, and may or may not have any damage, but the wet well is definitely failed in Unit 2, and I can see where they wouldn't want people whooping and hollering about wet wells. I'm sure the insides of that are a complete mess at this point. Even if this was a normal construction site, it would be a complete mess at this point.<p>I see others have mentioned there may be a truck access tunnel at this spot.

I'm a consultant, and I'm charged with completing development on a large asp.net web application. It's about 25-50% of the way to being complete thanks to the previous devs who abandoned the project. I have full creative control of the project, so I am faced with a conundrum: If I stick with asp.net, I'll likely end up rewriting the app in place. The developers abondoned the project for a reason. They followed OO to the point of making a huge and hard to manage code base with hundreds of classes thatneed to be finished. Should I trudge on and finish this? I ask because I gave the client a substantial discount on my services for an equity stake in the company, and we have already made plans for extensions to my contract to deliver peripheral apps and additional features once the web app is delivered. My instincts are:
Put all the functionalities into an API,
Call the api from a new web app, possibly using bootstrap.
When phase 2 comes around, call API from native apps.<p>Or I could just stick with asp.net and have no jumpstart come phase 2, but it just seems so inefficient.  Can I get some feedback as to what you would do in this situation?",1346706431

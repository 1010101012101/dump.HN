Was Apple too personal to Steve? Is it even possible to define what made Steve Jobs the person he is and in turn what really made Apple a success?",1317902334

This is needed for my project - a platform that will configure automatically whole project and run CI for you. Good configuration management practices are especially important for projects in rapid growth phase, when it is easy to lose quality. I have huge experience in this field so I could really help.<p>So, what comes to my mind might be:<p>-	Running the build after each commit esp. when commits flood in and local build takes long;<p>-	Support for all the major frameworks (RoR, Django, Play). Any others?<p>-	Automatic creation of functional tests based on URL mappings;<p>-	Various code metrics, like cyclomatic complexity (number of paths through a piece of code) for instance;<p>-	Getting big picture what is going on in the project and what the trends are;<p>-	Sharing best practices of configuration management.<p>Are the above important to you if you could get them out of the box? Is anything missing? Do you have any problem I could help with?<p>Also if you would like to you see the beta and test it, please drop me an email:

Off a single digit marketshare (iphone as a % of the phone market) Apple makes more than half the profits in the industry (<a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2011/01/31/fourth-quarter-mobile-phone-industry-overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asymco.com/2011/01/31/fourth-quarter-mobile-phone...</a>).<p>When I wonder which model is sustainable, the questions I have are about the companies struggling to make profit from massive marketshare, not the one making good money from modest sales. I'm not saying Apple are nailed on, just that the whole industry is very very uncertain and there are questions and issues across the board.<p>Picking up a couple of specific points:<p>As for a 2+ year old design doing well against newer models. The iPhone 4 (15 months old) is the biggest selling phone in North America. The second biggest selling phone? The 27 month old iPhone 3GS. This is less of a fashion market than a lot of people make out. Plus if you're looking for precedents, I'm not clear where we see one for HTC, Samsung or LG doing anything particularly innovative in this sector. Good phones yes, market changing, I don't see it.<p>The Mac as a ""ghetto"" with limited software availability? Do you have a Mac? The Mac has for years had a far more active independent developer community that Windows ever did. For c. $30 (less now in the AppStore era or if you shop around) you could pick up high quality bits of software to do just about anything. When I got my first Mac 6 years ago (Windows user for 20 years before that) I was staggered by the ecosystem.

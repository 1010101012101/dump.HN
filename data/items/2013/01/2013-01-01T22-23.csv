4994341,comment,4992401,4994253,26,0,gaustin,,,"First I have to say that my symptoms have been pretty well-controlled for years. After my diagnosis I lost a lot of weight and became very physically active. This seems to have helped in a miraculous way (according to several doctors). Managing stress, sleeping well, eating well and keeping active seem to work as good or better for me than medications.<p>I have mild hallucinations. Pretty regularly I have odd physical sensations, like the skin on my legs is sloughing off or very convincing body dysmorphia. Stuff like this is worst when it keeps me awake. Exercise or a hot shower tend to fix this.<p>When I am really stressed out I have some auditory (usually more or less ambient noise) and visual (usually motion at the corner of my vision) hallucinations. The visual/auditory hallucinations usually only kick in when working 50+ hours a week for extended periods and worried about personal things. To minimize these periods, I work super hard when I am working and try to keep complications to a minimum. I'm sure it has held my career back somewhat not to have the same capacity for work hours as others. (Yes, 50+ hours a week is minimal for a lot of people, but for me I need that extra time to relax and recuperate.) The last visual/auditory hallucinations I had were pretty recent. The past couple of months required some 60ish hour weeks, I had a good deal of disrupted sleep and my wife had some health problems.<p>I have strict routines. When they are broken I tend to get upset. For example, I have a rigorous exercise routine. When it snows and it makes it harder to get to the gym or out for a run, I get disproportionately angry. I eat things in a very particular way, if someone disrupts this I get angry and will probably tell them about it.<p>I don't like it when people repeat what I say unless I explicitly give them permission. An example is that my wife might discuss something with me and then discuss that with someone else, and include my view on the subject. That upsets me.<p>I do not struggle much (at all?) with paranoia or catatonia.<p>There is some more, but I'm not super comfortable sharing in a public venue where potential future employers are likely to see.<p>I recognize all of these things are not normal. Over the years I've built up a good set of filters that keeps most people from even noticing. That's not to say I bottle up the reaction, it's just that I've built in some mental processes that help keep the keel even.",1357080681

4994335,comment,4992845,4992845,11,0,pnathan,,,"I'd like to twist the title to be, ""We need to solve more hard problems"".<p>A considerable amount of what we do in computing is either (1) re-solving old problems with a new shell/language/os/widget library or (2) plumbing between said solutions for communication.  This is a fairly ridiculous state of affairs. At the risk of being a snob & starting a flamewar, I'd like to point out that node.js doesn't need to exist: it reimplements systems that already existed, and forces a contorted programming style. Why isn't that energy poured into Erlang or better libraries in C++ for event handling? The same argument can be made for a number of different technologies (why do we have F# divergent from OCaml, why do we have D instead of a better C++? why does MS have to keep spinning their APIs and forcing rework?).<p>My point is, when something is solved, it's good to move on until a compelling reason is found. Operating systems are largely solved, but most of the research stems from the 60s-80s, AFAICT.  A number of concepts brought up back then got dropped in the rush to PCs and DOS. One that I particularly remember is the idea of multilevel security partitions. OK, maybe that's a bad idea. But it'd be good to look into it again.   What about operating systems written in dynamic languages? What would that look like in a multicpu/multithreaded/multiuser environment? It'd likely be absurdly slow, but maybe it doesn't have to be. There's got to be some great work that was done in Genera that can be leached into the modern world.<p>Why, for instance, is the most common text entry solution a QWERTY keyboard? Why even a keyboard? Isn't there a better solution (voice has worked really badly for me, sadly). Isn't there a better way than what amounts to a revamped typewriter?  What about the mouse? My mouse looks suspiciously like Englebart's mouse from '69 or so. Tablets are a <i>great</i> step in this regard. I don't really <i>like</i> them, but I have great respect for Apple, Google, and MS for trying to move beyond the WIMP paradigm.

4994332,comment,4992401,4992954,9,0,dkarl,,,"I bailed on a similar situation where I could feel myself falling for someone with schizo-affective disorder with a side of bipolar disorder.  I certainly understand where you're coming from.  I think the question is whether you can know someone apart from their mental illness.  The woman in my case was extremely functional despite ongoing symptoms, but she also behaved destructively.  She was skilled and enthusiastic at creating drama between people and heedless of the consequences of her personal behavior.  She was good at creating beautiful things, situations, and emotions, but compulsive about destroying them.<p>This is a bit confusing to talk about, because the terms colloquially applied to such behavior (the insensitivity of which the current context makes clear) are ""crazy"" or ""psycho.""  Every time she did something destructive, I had to ask myself:  is she doing this because she's mentally ill, or because she's ""psycho?""  Meaning, in less offensive language, is this purely mental illness, or is she also a cruel, capricious, irresponsible person?  I couldn't even be sure it was valid to ask the question, but my intuition said the latter.  She was just as destructive to herself as she was towards everyone else, but then again, so are many people who simply have ""issues"" without  major mental illness.  On the other hand, she had ongoing symptoms including auditory hallucinations (her version of ""well"" was when she knew they weren't real), and she often made strange connections between things, strange jumps in conversation, which she couldn't explain coherently.  I always felt guilty about holding her responsible for her behavior.  After I cut off contact with her, I felt very guilty about it at first, because I had such intense feelings for her.  I thought, ""If <i>I</i> run away from her, who will ever stay?""  When I caught myself thinking that way, though, I knew I had made the right decision.<p>The reason I tell my story is that it's possible Kas has satisfied himself on which aspects of Sally's behavior and personality are ""her"" and which aspects are due to her mental illness.  He says she's ""Guileless, straightforward, self-aware, good-hearted, open-minded, always truthful, always kind,"" which does not describe someone acting under the influence of schizophrenia.  When he says he would throw himself in front of a bus if she asked him to, he's clearly not talking about the schizophrenic Sally, unless he has a death wish.  If he has separated her from her mental illness, perhaps it's no different from loving someone who has any other disability.<p>This is all bound up in the question of free will, of course.  People generally believe in free will, and they treat mental illness as a limitation on free will.  If you believe that personal history is just as binding as mental illness, then any discrimination on the basis of a person's behavior is equally just or unjust whether they are mentally ill or not.",1357080529

Instead of being subject to arbitrary powers, the 'people' rule themselves - we are only subject to laws that we ourselves have authored (or delegated to others to author in our current cases).  But allowing everyone to vote on everything violates autonomy.<p>Most people recognise that autonomy requires having some/equal say in matters that materially affect them.  Yet few realise that giving others a say in matters that don't affect them undermines the autonomy of those affected.  So while laws apply relatively equally to all those in a jurisdiction, the distribution of effect is far from equal.<p>Proxy voting allows those with little skin in the game to drown out those significantly affected by proposed laws. The fact that people don't have the time to vote on every issue, and so will only likely vote on matters important to them, is one of the major strengths of direct democracy.",1357079486

             scraped the comments for each article or (even better)

Precision and accuracy are two different things, and both are entirely context dependent.  There's a famous book, <i>How to Lie with Maps,</i> all about it.  Maps are how we take things from others by drawing a line in a different place, or how we explore boundaries by drawing what we know and wondering what's everywhere else.  They are stories on paper that sometimes have legal or royal or personal meaning, but they are always still stories.  Geography is a social science, and cartography is as much art as it is evidence.<p>In <i>Sketching User Experiences,</i> Bill Buxton tells a story about maps, where your Google Glass example breaks down:<p><i>Imagine that you were kayaking off the coast of Greenland, and needed a chart to find your way.  You might have a paper chart, but you will probably have trouble unfolding it with your mittens on, and in any case, it will probably get soaked in the process and become unreadable.  From the urban perspective, an alternative solution might be to go to your PC and use a mapping program on the internet... However, there is a minor problem here, too. You don't have your PC with you in the arctic, much less in your kayak. We all know about internet-enabled cell phones and PDAs--they might provide another alternative. Why not jump on the internet using your cell phone, and get the map that way?<p>But here is the problem. You probably can't get cellular service where you are in your kayak. And even if you can, your battery is probably dead because it is so cold. Or, your phone won't work because it is wet. Even if your mobile phone does work, and you have service, you probably can't operate it because you can't do so without taking your mittens off, and it is too cold to do so.<p>Now let's look at a third approach, one that the Inuit have used... This shows two tactile maps of the coastline, carved out of wood. They can be carried inside your mittens, so your hands stay warm. They have infinite battery life, and can be read, even in the six months of the year that it is dark. And, if they are accidentally dropped in the water, they float. What you and I might see as a stick, for the Inuit can be an elegant design solution that is appropriate for their particular environment.</i><p>There are entire cultures where your Euro-centric view of mapping does not compute, so much so that researchers at my alma mater would go into jungles and teach third world tribes how the usurping white man views their world so they can make maps that you, the outsider, can understand what they had previously only expressed emotionally.  There are entire continents where your ""Mirror World"" cannot <i>accurately</i> represent <i>anything,</i> and I feel that puts your seminal moment much further away than you imagine.",1357078289

  - 13 years of engineering.  
  - 4 years user growth.
  

  Looking for long-term or short-term consulting work.


  Specialize in Rails (full stack) and user growth 
  (marketing/advertising). I'm a hybrid coder and marketer
  with a proven track record. I love working on-site and
  work just as well remotely.
  
  
  I'm a friendly guy with an aggressive attitude and good 
  communication skills.
  
  
  I'm looking for projects solving real problems. My belief
  is that the product (features) reach customers ASAP and     
  that's what ultimately matters. Testing code is good, but 
  not the end-all be-all. Iterate on what works and make it 
  better. 


  I'm a believer in customer development, mining data for 
  user behavior that we can code into features and marketing 
  campaigns.
  

  Have built new, and worked on existing, Rails applications 
  including (but not limited to):

  - A permission based advertising platform.

  - An e-comm up-sell marketing platform.

  - A social media platform.

  - Most recently one of the      
    largest e-commerce flash sales sites.
  

  Contact me below to have your problems solved.
      
  Cheers!

Shutting these guys down isn't going to do much except stifle innovation.""<p>The Internet <i>is</i> a net full of cool, informative, and deep articles about just about every subject imaginable. The content farms are not where you find them, and they're getting in the way of the quality results.<p>The fact that eHow shows up, at all, in Google listings, is a failure of Google on an epic scale. There are <i>always</i> better sources for any given topic than eHow (or Mahalo, except <i>maybe</i> on cooking a turkey).<p>Killing content farms by blacklisting them from Google would not stifle innovation, it would allow the the quality content to rise to the top, as it should. The best content on any given niche subject is usually found on a tiny niche site run by someone that <i>loves</i> their subject. Google punishes tiny niche sites, comparatively speaking, despite the fact that they are <i>better</i> for niche subjects. And, it rewards big-ass content farms like eHow, despite the fact that 99.9% of their content is literally worthless.",1297227456

Those are not mere ""body shops.""<p>If so, they are providing actual value that I can not see.  I have never seen such an agency consistently deliver good people.<p>Or maybe I haven't seen the right agency?   as far as I can tell, only the very best of them pay contractors on time.<p>The very best body shop I've ever worked for or seen was one guy who never actually met me in person.  But he paid me on time, and the guys he sent to the client were consistently technically better (and socially worse; or, at least, more weird.  Remember, this guy hired me.) than other body shops.<p>I think the main problem with quality is that all other things being equal, people prefer safe jobs with benefits.   Even the really top end body shops that give benefits usually don't pay you for bench time, so a full time job is safer, and generally more desirable, so the people who end up working for the body shop (or contracting house or whatever you want to call it)  are people who, for whatever reason, can't hold down a full-time job.   the inexperienced or otherwise less desirable.<p>Yes, there is a premium paid for contractors by the client, but that is nearly always entirely taken as overhead or profit.

It's certainly very applicable to the money you just raised, since by definition it was a trade of equity-for-money.<p>It's not just about being able to ""afford it"" (which is obviously better than not being able to afford it).

The only user modifiable media was a floppy disk (which didn't have autorun enabled, I believe). PCs were becoming ""multimedia"" computers and the CD-ROM was the center of that. CD-ROMs could then only be manufactured by rather large companies and typically cost a significant amount of money to acquire. The idea that people would acquire autorunnable media casually was foreign. The idea that the ability to create autorunnable media would be common as dirt was also foreign. Moreover, the internet was still new and not widely popular so the problem of malicious autorunnable media was thought to be fairly limited in scope.<p>The modern era of dirt-cheap user modifiable CDs and USB drives along with ubiquitous internet connectivity opens up the seemingly small (though still serious) security problems of autorun into gaping holes.<p>Moreover, at the time many developers didn't take security issues very seriously.",1297224450

You ship, and discover that (a) people who have a Symbian phone and can afford to buy your apps are just waiting to upgrade to iOS or Android, and so won't invest any time in new apps on their Nokia phones and (b) Symbian is only growing in use in the developing world, where people are very unlikely to buy your app because the cost is a lot more significant.<p>So you give up, and go back to iOS and Android where the toolsets are nicer and there is more money to be made.",1297224431

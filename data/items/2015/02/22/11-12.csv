This is true, but you could use ssh forwarding or VNC (at a considerable performance penalty). I believe the other security issues (mainly related to PID 0 and which user processes are run at) will be solved shortly. Running applications in Docker is never going to be as secure as running an app in a full VM, but it can definitely be better than trusting random code on the internet (the recent Steam client issue springs to mind).",1424606309

9089086,comment,9086330,9088983,0,0,makomk,,,"The official CDC website says that they found it definitely <i>did</i> cause intussusception:<p>&quot;The results of the investigations showed that RotaShield® vaccine caused intussusception in some healthy infants younger than 12 months of age who normally would be at low risk for this condition. The risk of intussusception increased 20 to 30 times over the expected risk for children of this age group within 2 weeks following the first dose of RotaShield® vaccine.&quot;<p>See <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/rotavirus/vac-rotashield-historical.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/rotavirus/vac-rotashield...</a>. Now, that&#x27;s not much of an increase in absolute terms because intussusception is relatively rare, but so is infants dying due to rotavirus infection in the US - the estimates I&#x27;m seeing are 20-60 deaths a year without vaccination. Even a relatively rare adverse reaction is enough to outweigh the benefits of the vaccine in the US.<p>Now, you&#x27;re right that the clinical trials &quot;detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects&quot;. That&#x27;s because they were so small that, even though the adverse reactions were common enough to outweigh the benefits, they couldn&#x27;t actually detect them as being statistically significant. Hell, even if the vaccine was somehow hypothetically killing ten times as many babies as would&#x27;ve died from rotavirus, I don&#x27;t think the trials used to approve the vaccine could have detected that.

Or, you could have a more fine grained API to allow GC on these custom heaps. Perhaps you could even allow copying objects back to the main heap. You&#x27;d have to ban cross heap references or have a smart API that lets users pin an object in the main heap while it is known to be referenced by an object in custom heap.<p>Most of the time in client applications, you only care about GC pauses on the main UI rendering thread, but GC pauses in other threads are less obvious because there&#x27;s no jank, just that latency may go up for some operations.<p>You could have a kind of best of both worlds with languages that support non-GC allocation for your UI thread, but GC everywhere else.",1424605950

That is a massive handicap that the system will have (it&#x27;s not going to be co-located and probably won&#x27;t have access to early information, etc). I&#x27;m wondering whether it&#x27;s possible to develop a system that accommodates these deficiencies while still ending up on top.",1424603232

The only thing this exercise achieves is whether &quot;you&quot; personally can make money with a low-touch approach using software.",1424603188

It triggered my previous comment as it serves as another example of the life of well off westerners becoming one more step abstracted and insulated from reality, which is something that ought to be resisted. The more removed you are from your source of food, water, clothing etc. the more wasteful the process of obtaining it is in terms of resources and damage to the environment. Also, if you read Jared Diamonds book &#x27;Collapse&#x27; (wherein he deduces from various examples of collapsed societies a framework of factors that lead to collapse) one common factor in societal collapse is: the elites and decision makers being insulated from the negative consequences of their decisions. A modern example would be, an oil magnate decides to maximise profit by  using a dirty refining process, this pollutes the ground water in that area, but of course he can afford to live far away in a gated community and drink bottled water. Thus he is insulated from the negative consequence of his actions. This can lead to the elites and decision makers making a series of decision that eventually lead to the destruction of the entire society (for example cutting down all the trees on Easter island)<p>I&#x27;m aware that this may all seem a bit dramatic when we&#x27;re talking about pizzas, but the mindset of the elites is important in this case. Services like this encourage not knowing where your food, water, clothing etc. is coming from.",1424603186

From OP&#x27;s blurb it&#x27;s pretty obvious he&#x27;s very new to this and most likely hasn&#x27;t traded much stocks even using the &quot;simplistic human investing&quot; approach. If you&#x27;re planning on using this exercise to help &quot;mature&quot; your understanding of how you should start tracking/investing stocks then this could be a rewarding effort. If, however, you&#x27;re planning on jumping straight in to build this to &quot;actually&quot; trade stocks I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ll be in a world of hurt before you even know it. If you&#x27;re serious about the journey, then the choice of programming language or DB is a long long way down the road; start from the basics and work your way up from there.",1424602944

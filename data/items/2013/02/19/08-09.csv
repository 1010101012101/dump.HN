In that sense, many of your friendships are predicated on chance encounters. Most are, as someone pointed out, serendipitous.<p>If you want to make friends out of people who aren't your colleagues, you need to take actions to ensure your friendships aren't dependent on chance encounters anymore. If you meet someone you think is really interesting, <i>you</i> need to go out of your way and invite them to lunch/dinner/parties/events. This does blur the line between networking and friendships though. Then again, the strongest network is a network of friends.<p>I also wonder if there's a difference between SF and the Mountain View/Palo Alto/San Jose area. It seems to me like it would be easier to stay connected with people in SF, since you'll often bump into the same people at different parties/events - I know that this has certainly been true in my case whenever I go up to SF.

It was a surprise aerial attack on a strategic port city back in 2001. Almost 3,000 people were killed.<p>I don't believe any cyber attack is likely to be that dramatic or destructive for the same reasons that computer systems are hard to protect. Complexity. It's hard to protect a computer system because there are so many potential vulnerabilities. It's easier to take one down, but that won't necessarily result in much damage. To do that you need to take over a complex system and exercise sophisticated and dynamic control of it, to orchestrate very specific behaviour, which is not easy. For example shutting down the computers at a nuclear power plant may be feasible. However taking control of it and manipulating it with enough sophistication to engineer a meltdown, while overcoming all the computerised and physical safeguards would be a lot more complex to pull off.",1361262753

I understand the principles of supply and demand, but scalpers subvert this because you don't necessarily have to resell all the tickets you purchase to be profitable - just enough that your margin covers the unsold ones.  The only people losing are the fans, who can't get affordable tickets, even when the venue is half full.<p>I had no idea how bad the scalping situation was until I tried to buy tickets to a show in Chicago (in Australia where I live, it's a problem, but I've never been in a situation where I couldn't get tickets by buying them when released).  I stayed up late (in my time zone) to get tickets, and missed out because the website wasn't dealing well with the load. Next morning, I got up, and there were 400+ tickets for sale on StubHub. For a 1300-person venue. Even if 100% of scalped tickets went on sale, on one website, within 10 hours of the event going on sale, that's still 30% scalping rate.<p>There are a number of solutions both easy (printing name and date of birth on the ticket, which is matched to ID at the gate) or difficult (personally I like the idea of taking 'bids' for tickets - the maximum someone is willing to pay, and then at a cutoff date taking the nth person in line's bid (of an n capacity venue) and issuing all tickets at that price.  Minimal risk for promoters as they can cancel if they can't manage a reasonable margin, and no one overpays for tickets).<p>Anyway, I digress.  My point is, I think potential sellers would see this service as ripping them off, and would be hesitant to list tickets unless they weren't confident they could resell them, and buyers would resent them because you're essentially taking a large margin for almost no service.  If the algorithm works there's minimal risk for the company, you'd just be taking free cash.  I could see myself as a buyer actively avoiding using this (hypothetical) service where possible because of it, and sellers also avoiding it as they perceive an offer from you as a way sign that value would go up and they shouldn't sell now.<p>As an aside, when I was in the US I got a ticket to see the SF giants for about $10 for great seats on SeatGeek.  Was super happy with the experience (and the people next to me who so generously offered rules clarifications for me).",1361262658

If they add a new regulation regarding health concerns in food processing, it is assumed that they do some form of balancing of cost and benefits. It is also assumed that we do not use the same cost and cost-benefit analyze they have laying around from the 19th century. Most people assume that what ever was true a few hundred years ago might have changed in the years and thus a new check regarding cost and benefits to society is in order.<p>When government goes out using patents to influence the market to produce more inventions, they don't do a cost-benefit analyzes. They barely even use the 200 year old check regarding previous invention, obviousness and discovery, as the number of inventions has increase beyond what is human possible to check. They just grant the same sized 20 years state enforced monopoly to anyone who ask, and hope that any problems will be solved by the court system.<p>The core of this case is how one should read the patent-exhaustion. It really shouldn't be about that. It should be about how and if the government should give aid to an company that invented, produced and successfully sold a grain that they modified with a discovered gene. It should be about the check and balance of the actions of government trying to influence the market with monopolies in an effort to encourage more inventions/discoveries regarding gene modified plants.",1361262591

There isn't a list of features you're theoretically able to use but the compilers don't support (templates in Old C++) or common things you do differently in every implementation.<p>If only this was true<p><a href=""http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-...</a><p>I had to develop with multiple C commercial compilers between 1999 and 2002, across several OS. The code had quite a few #ifdefs because of them.<p>Are you aware that C11 has optional features?<p>> Pascal figures in this in that the official standard Pascal was basically unworkable as a language, due to features like the size of an array being an obligatory part of its type and the resulting lack of a way to write a function that could handle more than one size of array. Having it be optional, as we see here in C, is really the only way to go unless an array knows its own size and won't let you overstep the bounds.<p>The first ISO standard yes, but all Pascal dialects always had feature parity with C, while being more type safe, fast compile times and direct support for modules.<p>Most of it was made part of the ISO Extended Pascal standard, which most people ignored as the industry cared more about Turbo Pascal compatibility. Both solve your arrays example.<p>The common complaint that the stronger type checking languages impose performance penalty with arrays bound checking is always wrong, as the compilers allow for it to be turned off.<p>In both cases it is the problem with standards and vendor differentiation, you seldom get a 100% compliant implementation of any standard.",1361261996

I really like the work, but the intention of the work is completely different.<p>> Live coding is absolutely everything about live feedback. This gives you access to performing in front of a live audience, but that is only part of it. It also allows new styles of collaborative programming, and exploring of ideas in composition.<p>This really isn't the point. The ""live feedback"" is not about performance, its not about new styles of collaborative programming, its not about composition of time-based media. It is simply a better way to debug your program, it is simply better feedback to the programmer while they are writing their program.<p>> Live coding is about using programming languages to manipulate running code, maintaining state (if there is any).<p>You've stated this differently before:<p>> For me, live coding is about live, end-user programming of time-based media. Live coders write software for themselves, and the timeline of software development is often shared with the end result. This brings both social and creative aspects of programming to the fore.<p>Now, imagine my frustration when I'm trying to promote a new way of debugging a program, and people say ""we've heard about this before, but we aren't very interested in music."" Do you understand why I'm frustrated? Live programming aims to change programming in general, you should be able to live program a web app, a map reduce program, an operating system, a compiler, anything! This is not the goal of live coding as I understand it.<p>> Check out the code in the ""hacking perl in nightclubs"" article that this one links to. The software it discusses takes on live updates without restarts or losing state (in fact, the code in the editor is part of the state).<p>But you see, that's where our disconnect is: LP is not just about updating code without losing state, its about changing the entire program's state as if the new code HAD ALWAYS existed. Simply preserving state is not good enough. Now in a dataflow language (like quartz composer), there is no state and you simply re-execute the new wiring; very easy. But if there is state involved, the problem becomes much harder. The live coding crowd hasn't done anything to solve that problem yet, and in fact, they don't really need to; it seems like preserving state is sufficient for your use cases.<p>> It also has an option to take on edits every keypress, but it's off by default, because it's impractical. Sometimes you just don't want 1 and 10 to be interpreted on the way to 100.<p>Did you ever watch the quicktime videos embedded in my 2007 paper? I did just that ('1', '10', '100') and the effect was quite nice; I got applause right there when I gave the talk at Onward. It is definitely a UX challenge, and Chris's discussion about steady frames, I think, is the key to a decent live programming experience. Also, Bret Victor's demos have no delay in them whatsoever; continuous feedback can be nice and exciting. Of course, we need to do a lot of UX and implementation work before it is actually practical. The live coding community has working systems today, you guys already have what you need; we don't, we just have a bunch of prototypes and demos (unless we count visual languages where liveness is easy).<p>> Live coding arose in an interdisciplinary context of music performance, pedagogy, media theory, psychology and computer science.<p>Sounds like a nice focused story to me :)<p>> The thesis you link to is really excellent, but has shared roots with live coding and is referenced in the live coding literature.<p>The important point to make about Chris's thesis is that it is very close to Bret Victor's demos and goals as stated in his learneable programming work. That this is a new way to understand code while we are writing code, the story is very narrow, nice, and easy to understand; there is no reason to expand it in other ways.",1361261333

You're right that the final diff, in this case the second-order diff, cannot by itself prove that my final adjustment fixed all of the broken sentence-end links. But I wasn't merely going on that evidence.<p>The whole point of using a second-order diff was to allow me to reliably carry forth the knowledge gained by my exhaustive review of the <i>prior</i> diff.  That exhaustive review told me that there were a dozen broken sentence-end links. And that's how many showed up as fixed in the final, second-order diff: one dozen.<p>So the prior and final evidence, together, allowed me to be confident that the adjustment worked as intended.",1361260950

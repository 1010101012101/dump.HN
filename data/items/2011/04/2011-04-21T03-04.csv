2469401,comment,2469186,2469351,12,0,tomdale,,,"I'm sorry that you were turned off by the Ruby build tools.<p>Many people see the build tools and assume that you need to know Ruby to use SproutCore. This isn't true. SproutCore apps are written 100% in JavaScript, and Ruby just happens to be the language we used to create the tooling needed to build serious web applications.<p>For example, the build tools will automatically concatenate your JavaScript and CSS files, minify them, ensure that dependencies are loaded in the correct order, provide a proxy so you can work around the single-origin policy during development, generate unit tests, and much more. We think that the trade-off is worth it, especially since all Linux and Mac OS X distributions come with Ruby and RubyGems.<p>One of the guiding principles behind SproutCore is that it allows you to build well-architected JavaScript applications where the separation of concerns is clear. Being able to organize your JavaScript files is an important part of that. I think you'll find that when you start building web apps of any serious scale, you'll end up assembling a collection of command-line tools that do all of these things. We just put them all in one place for you.",1303358201

Do it privately, discuss your concerns etc etc. If you just go for the public 'you are doing it wrong' approach, you breed resentment & distrust. OTOH, a good rant in public sure can make you feel good even if it probably isn't going to sway your target to your side. Then again, that wasn't really the reason it was done, was it?<p>Or put another way... if you are going to rant, rant. Don't pretend like your public ranting at someone is an attempt to get them to agree with you. It is about making yourself feel better.

At least, not in all cases. With care and some tuning, people can get extremely good performance out of the thread-per-connection approach. Please check the document linked in the parent to this thread (<a href=""http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2008/03/writing-java-multithreaded-servers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2008/03/writing-java-multithrea...</a>)<p>What's more, even the systems that are very good at this do not use something like NIO, epoll, or select (as anything other than a very buried implementation detail). Erlang, for example, doesn't restrict you to the kind of model that raw NIO does. NIO is a fine thing for what it is, and a potential building block for many things, but it's not a very compelling as a server framework. MINA is a better suggestion, but still not a universal catch all for these sorts of problems.<p>I'm not trying to say, ""NIO is never right, tpp is never wrong."" I'm just saying your categorical statement is not always correct. Making that statement is wrong, and it's misleading, and I don't think the problem you found was really due to the unavoidable overhead of the threading.",1303356991

If you've achieved FU money, meaning you don't really have to worry about money or working a regular job ever again, then it's hard to imagine what an early $100k or $1m liquidity event can mean for another person. And it may not even be the case that the founder wants it for bling-and-hookers reasons: he may want it for health reasons, or to help out family members in some way, where there's not really an option to put it off another 5-10 years. Now add to the equation that founders may very well be underwater on a home mortgage, may have debts racked up, unpaid college loans, etc. and early liquidity, even if it means a smaller <i>potential</i> total payday overall, starts making a lot of sense.

Millionaires were being made every day. Really the only thing you had to do was put up a site with a few images and videos, pay someone to link to you, and you could see the money start rolling in.<p>Then, the affiliate model came into play, and TGPs were created (thumb gallery posts). Some owners complained that these would hurt sales because affiliates were giving away content for free. It didn't hurt - in fact, sales grew much stronger.<p>MGPs followed (movie gallery posts), where images were replaced with short video clips. Sales remained strong. The industry was quick to see how these tools benefited them.<p>What the industry did not see coming, however, were the tube sites. How can you have a profitable business selling adult videos and images online when some website is letting you stream full-length videos for free? Why would you pay for adult content? Thus, adult companies have been dropping like flies. Not only providers, but also payment processors. Millions have been lost or stolen.<p>I know, I know, ""Boohoo those poor porn people aren't getting their money""... but what if you woke up tomorrow and realized that someone was giving away YOUR software for free (assuming you've created software that is not open sourced)? All of a sudden your income gets sliced and diced.<p>Nowadays, the only adult companies making a good amount of money are those that offer a more ""personal"" experience - live cam shows, girls/boys who blog with their members and do requests. Things you can't pirate: the human experience.<p>Oh, and gay sites. Gay always sells.<p>Porn companies can't really go after these illegal porn tube sites. Many are based in China, and the owners are hidden behind layers of privacy sheets. The know what they're doing is hurting thousands of people, but their greed for personal profits are first in their minds.<p>While I would not like receiving robocalls from lawyers threatening to sue me if I don't settle, I can see how some of these guys really have no choice but to turn to litigation to recoup some of their lost income.",1303355243

They&#x27;re the plastic version, not the metal snow plow survivable version. There&#x27;s almost never snow down there anyway. Driving at night is amazing. The downside is that the roads are so nice people get a little too comfortable and relaxed when driving. So there&#x27;s massive amounts of accidents and pedestrian hits and fatalities.",1397447961

Also, &#x27;Google Safe Browsing&#x27; reliably, and in a semi-privacy-protecting manner, informs multiple browsers of a blacklist of scam/malware sites.<p>I can see the problem has some tricky parts to it... but it doesn&#x27;t seem any parts are thorny, intractable problems.<p>Have CAs prepare a digest (maybe bloom filter?) of revocations regularly. Sign the hash of this digest, and make the digest available via many redundant paths (mirrors, CDNs, P2P networks). Interested servers – perhaps every server reliant on a certain CA – gossip via headers (or even DNS) about the latest and greatest CRL versions they&#x27;ve seen.<p>Then browsers can be reasonably sure they&#x27;ve got the latest, or that it&#x27;s somehow being kept from them (gossip from third parties says there&#x27;s a signed later one, but all usual sources are unreachable) – without an extra, slow, privacy-compromising poll every new TLS session.<p>Pirates have no problem flooding the world with fresh media files, against active legally-privileged interdiction efforts, with each such file much larger than all revocations ever. Why can&#x27;t certificate/TLS professionals and &quot;cyber infrastructure authorities&quot; match that?",1397447837

In other words, there&#x27;s only one winning strategy : always betray the company. In this case that would mean say whatever needs to be said to get you hired/an offer. Also this works reasonably well in normal situations as well, if you&#x27;re negotiating about anything, make it clear that your default first play in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is to betray, but it&#x27;s up for negotiation. If you don&#x27;t do this, any sales/management drone worth his salt will immediately exploit this.<p>If you don&#x27;t know yourself, and have attempted and failed to look this up, why do you assume the other person knows, really ? Either the other person is competent or not (ask a <i>really</i> difficult but slightly wrong question to find out, in a roundabout way, like &quot;I can&#x27;t get my head wrapped around how &#x27;static&#x27; affects global versus local variables. It makes global variables no longer stack allocated, but what does it do to local variables ?&quot;. It&#x27;s a nice obvious error that shouldn&#x27;t make a capable person think worse of you, because it gives the perfect explanation, just assigns it to the opposite concept it should be assigned to).<p>If they don&#x27;t catch the error, assume they don&#x27;t know anything, because they&#x27;re a manager or HR drone checking boxes. The only thing to do is get past them. For the love of God, don&#x27;t tell them they missed the error. Frankly, you&#x27;ll be doing both yourself and your future team a favor by inaccurately checking their boxes. Also, getting past them is a good exercise in corporate skills, if you get hired, it won&#x27;t be the last time you need to get past them. If you feel like honesty is a value, I would advise you to save your perfect honesty for obviously technical people, not for management. Don&#x27;t outright lie, but absolutely try to avoid saying &quot;no&quot; because of technicalities. &quot;Do you have experience with windows vista ?&quot; -> &quot;I have experience with windows&quot;.<p>Keep in mind that the interviewer may be trying to do the same, stating an obviously wrong fact and asking you to check that box. &quot;Do you know java 9 ?&quot; is way too obvious, but something along the lines might be asked. Best answer to this is to inquire, not directly state it doesn&#x27;t exist. E.g. &quot;I&#x27;m following the java 8 updates, and there are some proposals that have been decided to be beyond java 8, but to my knowledge there is no java 9 software existing outside of Oracle. Can you clarify ?&quot;",1397446644

I have been thinking about this for a while, so I&#x27;ll throw it up to see if there is any interest. I would really like someone to create a website full of information and resources for first time startup employees regarding stock options.<p>It would be great if there was a calculator which would allow you to experiment with different liquidity outcomes given your existing/proposed stock options.<p>For example, you would be asked to enter the total number of outstanding shares, the number of shares you have now, the number of shares you are entitled to, your vesting schedule, if you have any acceleration upon change of control or other scenarios and if so how much, whether you have preferred vs common shares, liquidation preferences (if any), etc.<p>Once you enter all of the information that you have, the calculator can estimate  how much you stand to make in certain scenarios. You could answer &quot;How much does the company need to be bought for in order for my options to be worth $X?&quot; or &quot;If the company sold for $Y amount, how much would my options be worth?&quot;.<p>If certain pieces of information were not entered into the calculator, then it could show error messages and link to additional resources explaining why that particular number is so important.<p>I realize that the calculator would likely not be exact because of missing information and the complexities of each particular company&#x27;s structure.

Chinese civilization is united, apart from Taiwan, Singapore, and the overseas Chinese. The Indian subcontinent is (approx) 75% united into the nation of India, the rest splintered between Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, etc. Europe is more divided, but because there were 4 approx equal countries (60 million people in each of West Germany, France, UK, & Italy), they federated easily. North America is mainly the US, easily controlling Canada (and Australia/NZ). South America is 50% Brazil, so they can successfully electioneer in the ""South American Union"". The Muslim world is more divided, with a few equally sized players (Egypt, Turkey, Saudi, & Iran) who won't ever federate because of religion and foreign interference. And sub-Saharan Africa is the most divided of all. Unity and modern success seem to be correlated, though of course not necessarily one causing the other.",1281934763

Total tuition costs over the 5 years I attended college were ~$133,000 USD (including housing while I was living in the dorms my first two years). It is possible to pay for most of your school as you go along. I was fortunate enough to have my parents pledge $40,000 ahead of time. The rest was mostly paid for by either myself or by scholarships. I started working full time after my sophomore year at a job that a ""tuition assistance"" program that paid you more if you were going to school. A lot of large companies have these (although sometimes there are strings attached, such as requiring you to work for x amount of time after you graduate) and I'd highly suggest looking for them. Also, I hunted down scholarships in my free time. I got about $52k in scholarships - many of which I won because I was the only person who applied for them (although the largest was an academic one for good marks in high school).

1606888,comment,1605361,1606838,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't really understand the confusion surrounding how much debt is bad.  Debt is good when it allows you to make more money in the future than your cost of capital.  It is bad when your cost of capital is higher than the amount of additional income you derive from that capital.  If your cost of capital was greater than the income derived, then you lost money over the long run by taking out that debt.  There's only one good in play (money), it's completely fungible, and so this should be self-evident.  If it's not, it's also covered in first-year econ.<p>Now, there's a lot of uncertainty as to whether a particular investment will yield returns greater than the cost of capital, and this is why CEOs and CFOs get paid big bucks.  But the fundamentals themselves are not hard.  Nor is it hard to look at $9T in federal debt, $2.5T in consumer credit, or $600K mortgages taken out by families with $30K in income and realize it's virtually impossible that the additional income generated by taking out that debt will pay for the interest on it.",1281934420

The author just grabs at everything potentially unappealing he can and throws it in a pot:<p>> (The UAE was one of only three nations—the others were Saudi Arabia and Pakistan—to recognize the Islamic fundamentalist government in Afghanistan.)<p>There's no analysis of why there - notice how Dubai is one of the most progressive countries in the Middle East about dress, culture, and women working, and yet gets no trouble/bombings from fundamentalists? They kind of have to appease knuckleheads geopolitically. Saudi Arabia do the same thing because they control Mecca and Medina and want to recognize all even nominally Muslim countries. Pakistan shares a really large, poorly guarded border with Afghanistan and a lot of citizens live along that border with no particular loyalty to either country's government - again, not rocking the boat for geopolitical reasons.<p>A lot of world nations recognize backwards places, which just means they'll negotiate with them - most of the world countries recognize North Korea, for instance, where the rampant abuses are 1000x worse than anything you could imagine in Dubai. That's not to say nothing is wrong in Dubai, but its demise has been greatly exaggerated, and this particular article isn't particularly well written.",1281933323

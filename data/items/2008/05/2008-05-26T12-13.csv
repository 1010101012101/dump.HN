200162,comment,200086,200086,0,0,mark_ellul,,,"No, its definately rigged, and I doubt the votes are taken from the user sms... Because I have been watching Eurovision for about 10 years now, before people voted at home... and which country votes for which has not changed...<p>It was news here in Spain that Franco (the dictator) bribed another country to vote for spain's entry one year... which happen to be the year that Cliff Richard almost won...<p>So basically the way I see it as is political voting... which a music competition tacked on...",1211806632

In fact the two supplement each other -- collaborative filtering using the entire customer database and then do a weighted merge of that with an algorithm ranking things based on social graph traversal.",1211806341

However, when I find a company blog that hasn't been updated recently, I assume nothing is happening.<p>Even if nothing is happening and/or something is happening and it can be divulged, I feel the company blog gives me a behind-the-scenes into how the business is growing. If nothing is happening, why not write about other companies (in other industries) like SmugMug's Don MacAskill does?<p>Two fresh blogs

Particularly all the Eastern countries vote for each other.<p>Most of the votes could be and were predicted by Terry Wogan.<p>The best reason to keep the Eurovision though is as a stark warning to what would happen if the UK integrates any further with Europe.",1211805419
200152,comment,200086,200086,0,0,jan_g,,,"Rigged ? I don't think that anyone is meddling with tele-voting. However, it is true that some people vote accordingly to nationality more than to song quality. The principle is the same as in politics, where people are more likely to support someone from their state, regardless of his/hers views. Nothing new here, move on.<p>And, if I understand eurovision voting correctly, at least top 5 songs need many more points than just those of neighbouring countries.",1211805144

With video comments I'm at the mercy of the commenter. I have to sit through the whole thing, watching it at whatever speed they choose to speak at rather than whatever speed I can read/scan text. It's also unsearchable.<p>Additionally, I think people tend to ramble more when they speak than when they're writing text that they can go back and edit.<p>Most of the time video just doesn't add anything to the discussion. <i>Maybe</i> they would be useful if the commenter needs to physically demonstrate something, or sing or recite a poem or something. But that's not the common case.<p>Now, if you could automatically transcribe the words from video comments and post it alongside the video (thus making watching the video <i>optional</i>) I wouldn't be so opposed to it. Video certainly has the potential to make the conversation a bit more personal. Sometimes it's nice to put a face to a name/comment (which could also help deter trolls)<p>(perhaps some sort of combination of speech recognition and crowd-sourcing could be used to transcribe video comments...)",1211803894

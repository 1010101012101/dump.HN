Most cloud storage options don&#x27;t lock the file when it&#x27;s being accessed.  Other people are able to open and edit the file and therefore the cloud software doesn&#x27;t know which file was the parent holder and instead updates the file based on the most recent changes.Even Microsoft&#x27;s Dynamic Cache Service doesn&#x27;t have a file locking feature.

9226376,comment,9224880,9226037,0,0,eitally,,,"We pay MS $3-5m/yr for desktop & server licenses to support a company wtih about 25,000 users/PCs.  Their licensing model is extremely convoluted, and near impossible for a single person to fully understand.  All the VARs have their own teams to work with enterprises on MS licensing & true-ups, and of course MS have their own org to help, too.  It&#x27;s not just counting usage, either, because so many products can be licensed in so many different ways.<p>For example, you can license Windows desktop OS by named user or by machine.  If you do it by machine, it&#x27;s cheaper, but if you do it by named user then that user can utilize the license on up to 5 (I think) devices (PCs, tablets, phones, whatever).  Generally speaking, licenses by machine are called CALs (client access licenses), and the way you get to a number is by running a report in Microsoft&#x27;s System Center Configuration Manager (MS SCCM), which is a server platform that helps you manage and distribute software to machines attached to your Active Directory domain(s).  However, there is another option for desktop licensing: desktop virtualization using Microsoft Remote Desktop running on a server or VM.  In this case, you have to pay for RDP CALs, which cost about 3x what a desktop &quot;Core&quot; CAL does.  If you&#x27;re running Terminal Server (for the RDP clients to access), you have to license that (the server OS + Terminal Server itself) ... however, you can reduce the Server OS license by also licensing Windows Server Datacenter Edition, which lets you pay once per Virtual Host and lets you spin up as many Windows Server VMs on that host as you want.<p>Anyway, counting all this and figuring out the contract amount is done using these SCCM reports, plus a bunch of manually counted stuff plugged into a complicated Excel workbook with many tabs, formulae and hidden VBA ... and then you start the person-to-person negotiations with Microsoft, because depending whether you&#x27;re a category A, B, or C enterprise you get different pricing, and you can be in different categories for different products or product lines.<p>I&#x27;d say that each time we have to do a true-up it consumes about 1000 person hours.",1426694223

9226370,comment,9225307,9225993,0,0,tonyarkles,,,"In (non-Quebec) Canada, there&#x27;s often an option to do French Immersion, even though the primary language is English. My parents put me in this program for elementary (K-8) school, and gave me the choice for high school, which I opted out of. There&#x27;s a few positives and negatives that I found watching myself and my peers:<p>Pros:<p>- The 9 years that I spoke French in the classroom for every class except for English was enough to make the language stick. I&#x27;m 31 now, and I can still speak, read, and write French. My vocabulary is weak since I don&#x27;t use French on a regular basis, but when I was in Paris, I had no problem understanding what was going on, ordering food, taking a cab, etc.<p>- I feel like having the 2nd language has made it easier to pick up other languages. I&#x27;m by no means fluent in Spanish, but when I was regularly doing DuoLingo Spanish lessons, I felt like things stuck very quickly.<p>- I also feel like some kind of structures in my brain from this help me pick up different programming languages. It seems like, compared to most of my peers, switching between new languages and learning new languages is generally a straightforward task for me, including weird ones like Erlang and Haskell. The majority of the effort goes into learning the concepts, not learning the syntax.<p>Cons:<p>- After graduating high school doing full immersion all the way through, many of my peers struggled with  writing in University. I distinctly remember my first roommate getting an essay back and he was freaking out about the terrible mark he got. He asked me to look over it to see if I could see what was wrong with it. I read through it and just told him &quot;Well... the problem is that you used English words, but you wrote it in French.&quot;<p>- Likewise, many of them had difficulties in math and science, where they understood the concepts very well from high school, but didn&#x27;t have the English vocabulary to describe what they were doing.<p>All in all, I&#x27;m super happy that my parents made the choices they did, and that I dropped out of immersion before high school. I think, too, it helped a lot that I read a <i>pile</i> of English books growing up, both fiction and non-fiction, which hopefully helped supplement my English vocabulary while I was learning French at school every day. I was the 10 year old who held on tightly to his copy of the Peter Norton pink shirt book :)",1426694183

The client may record the keys in known_hosts, allowing it to upgrade to better host key algorithms and a server to gracefully rotate its keys.<p>> The client side of this is controlled by a UpdateHostkeys config option (default off).<p>I wish it were on by default, but I guess they want to test it further before enabling it by default.

9226341,comment,9225079,9225824,0,0,redler,,,"I walk through that intersection most days. What they&#x27;ve done in NYC is interesting. That part of First Avenue used to be, like most in mid and upper Manhattan, six (or sometimes more) undifferentiated lanes.<p>The first change was the addition of dedicated bus lanes (right-most lane, painted reddish), complete with violation cameras and automated ticketing. This reduced competition among buses and cars -- in favor of buses, leading to somewhat better bus throughput. Cars now had five lanes -- although with parking in at least the left-most lane, and delivery trucks double-parked adjacent to the cars, more like three.<p>Then came the big bike lane initiative. In the book Traffic, by Tom Vanderbilt, some of the takeaways are that parked cars can form a buffer between flowing traffic and bike lanes, and that narrowing roads at intersections through the addition of islands with trees on them increases pedestrian safety (in no small part by reducing the speed of turning cars at intersections). To varying degrees they&#x27;ve applied these ideas -- the left-most lane is now entirely a bike lane (painted green, complete with its own traffic signals). Next to that is a dedicated parking lane -- yes, in lane two -- often buffered by concrete islands at intersections, with a tree or two. You can see this here [1]<p>Cars now have three or perhaps four lanes for general travel. For left turns, the bike and parking lanes are cut by a dedicated left-turn waiting lane [2] (usually with its own left turn signal, so left turners are not fighting pedestrians in the crosswalk).<p>On some avenues they then added &quot;Select Buses&quot;, which work on a &quot;trust-but-verify&quot; honor system so riders can enter and exit quickly through any of three wide doors without queueing to dip a Metrocard.<p>Finally, they cut the city-wide speed limit to 25 miles per hour, adjusting the timing of avenue traffic signals accordingly.<p>The result of all this has been much gnashing of teeth and rending of garments, but as a whole it&#x27;s made the city substantially better for bikers and pedestrians, and in many cases left turns are much easier for drivers.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@40.771088,-73.9538,3a,75y,53.97h,67.76t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1svoxzueWCAGhdwHjSDRETtQ!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/@40.771088,-73.9538,3a,75y,53.97...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@40.771088,-73.9538,3a,65.7y,194.74h,66.74t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1svoxzueWCAGhdwHjSDRETtQ!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/@40.771088,-73.9538,3a,65.7y,194...</a><p>[Edit: clarity]",1426693981

These tests are also hugely expensive. The answer, however, is to increase the amount of testing we&#x27;re doing - not eliminate it. The &#x27;problem to be solved&#x27; is to create a way to integrate trusted assessment into everyday instruction more often and less intrusively.<p>This requires us to develop a way to accredit (through national scale use/vetting) assessment materials on a much smaller scale. PARCC, ACT, et al. will maintain their current level of influence (functionally, not politically) so long as we can&#x27;t assure that teachers are assessing their students against agreed upon benchmarks.<p>If these benchmarked assessment materials could be integrated into everyday instruction (which, as a teacher, they surely can be) AND we can accredit them as accurately assessing student ability on &quot;competency X&#x27; then we will no longer need centralized, high-stakes assessment.<p>This accreditation will come from a decentralized exchange of classroom instructional materials/artifacts which will allow for the &#x27;cream&#x27; (i.e. materials that accurately assess &#x27;competency x&quot;) to be used, assessed, modified, re-used and finally accredited. Currently, teachers are silo&#x27;ed and rarely exchange learning materials beyond person-to-person contact or by physically gifting photocopies. Google docs facilitates exchange with real gains in productivity, but only within your immediate department (which could 4 people, could be 20 - but will hardly be >1000). We need the ability to fluidly exchange learning and assessment materials from all over the country/world that can be easily personalized for our classrooms.<p>As we more thoughtfully mediate the average classroom (which is inevitable) I hope we see these sorts of changes - but right now I don&#x27;t see very many edtech designers attempting to create tools that will enable my teaching in this way.",1426693384

I was hired I think about two years before it went public, and stayed for six years overall.<p>My equity came out to about $300k.  Which I know does not hit the thresholds that you put in the post, but clearly many of my coworkers who came in earlier and were more senior -- but still not founders nor part of the founding team -- did a lot better.<p>EDIT:  I should point out $300k was more or less actual.  If I had been really good at selling at the top of the market, it would&#x27;ve been more like $400k.  I suppose that overall it might end up being more or less, I still have a few tens of thousands in stock, but most of it ended up being the down payment on my house.  The $300k was after buying into the stock (since I wasn&#x27;t a super-early employee, many of my options cost like 10-25% of the then-market-value to buy), and after some taxes?  But not all?  AMT and prepayment of some taxes and stuff and my overall lack of financial discipline made it really hard for me to figure out how much tax I owed specifically on the stock.<p>Another EDIT:  Something else to point out was that at NetSuite, this was NOT principally from my initial grant at hire.  NetSuite gave new grants of stock every year with ones yearly review, and those grants were pretty generous.  Everything was on the same five year vest with a one-year cliff, so I got my entire year 1 and year 2 grants and then fractions of my remaining years.  The year 1 grant was at the lowest rate to buy in, but that wasn&#x27;t hugely important.  I would guess that about 1/3rd of the stock that I eventually realized came from my year 1 grant.  I&#x27;ve never been sure if that&#x27;s common practice or not with other companies, and if someone could shed some light on that, it&#x27;d be awesome.",1426692999

the article and more, sadly, it
sounds like a <i>Math Olympiad</i>
is not a very good way to do well
on the criterion.<p>Why not very good?  Because it looks
like the students are given what, for
the criterion, is poor direction
and use of time and effort.<p>E.g., when I look at my education
in math and its use in applications, 
most of the best of the education
had nothing to do with anything 
like a contest, especially a 
contest in the early and mid teens.
Instead, the best education was
well selected, well presented
material into the best work in
math, e.g., via the best authors --
Birkhoff, Halmos, Rudin, Royden,
Neveu, Tukey, Kelley, Suppes, 
Simmons, etc.<p>Or, my impression of <i>encouraging</i>
kids in their early and mid teens
to pursue math is to 
give them some <i>enrichment</i>
material such as Pascal&#x27;s triangle,
some number theory, various
puzzle problems, a lot of
recreational math, etc.  Why?
Because mostly the people
directing the efforts and
selecting the materials are
not very well educated in math.<p>In simple terms, to have kids
do well on the criterion in the
title is just to have the kids
proceed along the main line --
get through the standard
high school material in algebra
and geometry, with some applications
to high school chemistry and physics,
and then move on to a fairly
standard college major in math --
calculus, modern algebra,
linear algebra,
advanced calculus,
ordinary differential equations,
advanced calculus for applications,
partial differential equations,
point set topology,
measure theory,
functional analysis,
probability, statistics,
stochastic processes,
etc.<p>Then that background 
promises to be good for a good
answer 30 years later for

It won&#x27;t work, the theory goes, because when congestion reduces more people start driving, until the congestion reaches equilibrium again.<p>If buses take cars off the street and reduce congestion, the same argument applies; emergent demand will mean any cars taken off the street will soon be replaced.<p>Personally emergent demand has always struck me as a rather defeatist idea :)",1426692525

It may not be possible to schedule to avoid busses bunching up during peak times, if that&#x27;s how traffic behaves. The only way to fix it might be to run an excess of under-utilized busses, which cuts into profit margins. Which is something a private company with higher rates might be able to do, but the TTC is limited because service has to be accessible to everyone.<p>The risk of a private company like this showing up is that it&#x27;ll decide to focus intensively on the 20% of routes that yield 80% of profit. This bleeds the public transit service of funds needed to run less profitable services at off times that are used by people without 9-5 jobs, or people in less privileged areas. So the rich get better bus service, and no longer subsidize the service for the poor.",1426692449

So somebody has to provide security, as well as business sense. There&#x27;s a lot of opportunities for middlemen to get their middle on, and disrupting a market, under those conditions, just means shuffling in a new deck of middlemen. It doesn&#x27;t change the game.<p>In the same way, my guess is that disrupting a market which is inherently full of criminality risks - incentives to drive unsafely, opportunities for kidnapping and rape - means you just shuffle the deck of regulations.<p>Yet another criminality risk: taxi services of any kind, whether Uber or not, hold terrific opportunities for armed robbery. In some cities, being a cab driver is very dangerous, for this reason.<p>So, if Uber kills the entire taxi industry, then governments will have to scrap their taxi regulations and re-build a similarly gigantic regulatory infrastructure around Uber instead.<p>I think Uber is a really good lesson for entrepreneurs in how a market can look awesome but actually suck.",1426691478

It has two meanings:<p>1. the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness.<p>2. the state of being whole and undivided.<p>Some Christians would consider anti-homosexuality as a model for integrity, and how can you argue with that? They in fact are protecting integrity of the Bible.  They are at least honest about it.<p>When something is said, it needs to be put in correct context. What Warren Buffet was talking about probably meant loyalty, honesty, and consistent work ethnics and attitude. It should be clearly stated in order to have an objective measurement.<p>Also, I find organizations putting Integrity as part of their motto distasteful.

Later, he agrees with that but says he&#x27;s never involved. Well, it&#x27;s cause he chose to not be involved.<p>Then he says the news doesn&#x27;t help with his voting choice and he can get everything he needs to know from a simple guide but nothing could be further from the truth. If you really want to get involved in that, you can gather much more information about candidates and their real thoughts and if they would vote how you want them to vote on issues. You won&#x27;t get that from any simple guide or the TV news.<p>For example, maybe a bad one, I knew the brother of one of the candidates running for governor a while back. He&#x27;s an asshole. I worked next to a lady whose husband was in the state legislature and knew the candidate closely. When I mentioned that I met the candidate once before she said, &quot;Good family!&quot;. From there I could have learned a lot if I pursued it. You won&#x27;t learn any of that from a brochure or the TV news.<p>The problem with TV and radio news is you can&#x27;t pick and choose what you want to see or hear. Newspapers were good for that. You could flip pages quickly. Online news sources have that ability if online source is worthy and organized but those are few and far between.<p>In the past, TV news at most stations was its own department, especially at the networks, and not under control of marketing or advertising. This is no longer true. Despite some great reporters still working in newspapers, marketing has taken that over, too, cause the idea is to sell newspapers, not news.<p>The same is true for television. How often, now, do you see ads for upcoming entertainment shows during the &quot;news&quot;? How often does a new product come out and it finds itself on the &quot;news&quot;?<p>Unfortunate but true, the real news, along with in-depth discussion and analysis, can be boring to most. PBS probably is the only daily national news worth watching if you really want to learn but you may find yourself nodding off if the subject isn&#x27;t of interest. Again, advantage newspapers and properly structured online news sources that don&#x27;t emulate TV (CNN).<p>I worked in television news for about 10 years long ago with reporters who used to work in respected newspapers.

No sim has a history; every move was to the first available location that an invisible &quot;seeker&quot; agent found. So, by not having history, more agents had to be used in order to find available locations. Not to mention that water and electricity were basically implemented as &quot;wandering&quot; agents that just randomly walked the grid and &quot;deposited&quot; at every location they passed until depleted. Which, in turn, meant even more agents, because they had to be populous enough that the random walking would ensure visiting the entire grid.<p>TL;DR: There were a lot of decisions SimCity made that directly increased the number of agents required. This in turn directly impacted the #1 issue about the game: City size.",1426690940

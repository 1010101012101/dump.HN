Also, something like Heroku or google app engine <i>can</i> be a first step if you have only one developer for front/backend/&quot;dev ops&quot;. I prefer a VPS like like Linode as a first step but there is some specialized knowledge involved in setting up and maintaining a VPS correctly.<p>For the business person:<p>- Heroku first (if your dev hasn&#x27;t setup a VPS, dedicated server before)<p>- Once something like Heroku starts costing you more than $500 a month, it&#x27;s time to pay to move it to a VPS like Linode or digital ocean (new than Linode but cheaper). You can start out with just a server for the app and one for the DB",1376618370
6221792,comment,6221077,6221618,11,0,enoch_r,,,"First, the CPI absolutely <i>does</i> include housing, energy, and medicine[1].<p>Second, it&#x27;s incredibly hard to accurately measure such a nebulous concept as inflation (because there&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;general price level&quot;), but it&#x27;s pretty bold to definitively state that the CPI understates inflation. Measuring inflation is <i>hard</i>. We can buy an iPhone 5 for half what we paid for the first one in 2007--how do we quantify that price change in the CPI? Does a 2013 vehicle that costs the same as its 1995 counterpart represent high or low inflation? It&#x27;s not just prices that change--quality changes and spending behavior changes. And then we have to take the wildly changing behavior of 300 million consumers, buying god knows how many products, and consolidate that into a single number.<p>Then that single number has to stand up to those same 300 million people, each of whom is biased by 4 billion years of evolution to be loss averse, to <i>notice bad changes</i> and <i>grow accustomed to good changes</i>, and, inevitably, lots of them will point to things that are much more expensive, unconsciously blind to all the things that have gotten cheaper, and claim that the CPI understates inflation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_7</a>",1376618353

During spring and summer, there&#x27;s a stand from a tomato farm. They have something like two dozen different varieties of heirloom tomatoes. Lots of different colors and sizes, and all of them have wonderfully intense tastes. They don&#x27;t all taste the same, either.

I love SF, but hate living here.<p>Quite often, I find that I&#x27;d rather stay in than deal with the frustrations.. and, this has made me the most socially isolated I&#x27;ve been since I was a kid.<p>I live in a great home in a beautiful but remote part of the city. Nothing is convenient. The nearest restaurant or convenience store is a 25 minute walk away. Traveling just 5 miles to a F/T job in the soma can take longer than driving from the south peninsula.. and public transit in this city is terrible, so I just won&#x27;t tolerate working at a F/T job that requires daily presence in an office. Parking, if you can find it, is expensive and just a PITA.<p>The things I love and do to blow off steam are only available outside of the city.. Trail running the PG&E trail at Rancho San Antonio was one of them, and I&#x27;d do it several times a week before coming here. Now, getting to them takes a 90 minute round-trip drive.<p>Sometimes you&#x27;re heads down on code, and you just want to refuel and get out to clear your head, so you jump in your car and drive a couple minutes to a 24 hour drive-through to grab some food. Not possible here. Sure, you can hit the Jack in the Box on Geary, which does have a parking lot, but that can be perilous.. Or, you might need to pick up some RAM or a new HD.. The Fry&#x27;s in Palo Alto was 10 minutes away from my last home.<p>The SV has evolved the support the tech lifestyle.. and it will always be more friendly and efficient for many of us. Day to day living is generally easier for most. The schools are significantly better for your kids, too. SF is, and will always be SF, such as it is.",1376618151

6221764,comment,6220820,6220820,16,0,NathanKP,,,"As someone who only recently switched to Node.js from PHP I personally haven&#x27;t had any difficulty switching over to the callback frame of mind, and I haven&#x27;t experienced the &quot;callback hell&quot; so many people complain about. At first I was hesitant to start with Node because I saw blog posts by people bemoaning the spaghetti callback code that they ended up with. But I haven&#x27;t experienced any of that, although I am a relatively newbie Node programmer with only a few months of experience so far. My current project is quite non trivial as well, running into the tens of thousands of lines so far.<p>The key I&#x27;ve discovered to nicely organizing callbacks is to avoid anonymous callback functions unless absolutely necessary for a particular scope, or unless the function is going to be so trivial and short that it can be read in a single glance. By passing all longer, non trivial callback functions in by name you can break a task up into clear functional components, and then have all the asynchronous flow magic happen in one concise place where it is easy to determine the flow by looking at the async structure and the function names for each callback function.<p>Another major advantage to a code organization like this is that once you have your code such that each step has it&#x27;s own discrete function instead of being some inception style anonymous function tucked away inside another function inside another callback it allows you to properly unit test individual functional steps to ensure that not only is your code working and bug free at the top level functions, but also that each of the individual asynchronous steps that may make up some of your more complicated logic are working properly.<p>Most of the bad examples of callback hell that I see have anonymous callback functions inside anonymous callback functions, often many levels deep. Of course that is going to be a nightmare to maintain and debug. Callbacks are not the problem though. Badly organized and written code is the problem. Callbacks allow you to write nightmarish code, but they also allow you to write some really beautiful and maintainable code if you use them properly.",1376617856

6221759,comment,6221077,6221457,35,0,VexXtreme,,,"> Hence the somewhat curious (and I think, very American) idea of the &quot;Golden Years&quot;. If you put your head down and work hard, taking no vacations, until you&#x27;re age 65, then you flip 180 degrees in the other direction and retire into a life of full-time leisure. So if you live long enough, it really won&#x27;t be a waste; you cash it in all at the end!<p>And this exact kind of thinking is what the societal overlords want you to subscribe to. Give them the best years of your life to get a degree of freedom later in your life, when the freedom won&#x27;t matter anymore anyway, cause you&#x27;ll be pissing in your diapers and be limited to a very small subset of things a healthy young person can do.<p>I see it this way: when you&#x27;re retired and old, the overall potential of what you can do with your life is much lower than that of when you were in your 20s and 30s. Why is that? Because an old person with the same amount of time and money can do much less with those resources than a young person.<p>When you live your life like a run off the mill robot, living your life according to a set of societal expectations and rules set by other people, what&#x27;s the point of such a life anyway?<p>PS.

Or in a new while or for &quot;instruction&quot;.<p>But then the next construct is discovered, and its bad uses considered harmful, and its good uses need to be wrapped.  In lisp, mere programmers will just write the next macro to abstract away this new construct.  Other programming languages need to evolve or have new language invented with new &quot;instructions&quot;.<p>So now it&#x27;s the callbacks.  Yes, in lisp we&#x27;d just use closures, but this is only a building block for higher level constructs.  If those &quot;callbacks&quot; are needed to represent futures, then we&#x27;d implement those futures, as a mere lisp macro.<p>Yes, in the other languages you&#x27;re still powerless, and need to wait for the language designers to feel the pressure and implement a new &quot;future&quot; instruction or whatever.<p>Any language construct can be considered harmful eventually.  Concretely, a repeative use is a hint of that: the construct becomes meaningless because it&#x27;s used all the time, or apparently randomly (just like those GOTOs).  But it&#x27;s not that the construct is bad, it&#x27;s that its usage is not abstracted away in higher level constructs.  And the only way to do that is lisp macros.<p>So unless you&#x27;re programming in lisp (a homoiconic programming language that let you write easily macros in the language itself), you will always reach a point where some construct will be able to be considered harmful for lack of a way to abstract its uses away.",1376615088

Assuming the Big Mac was still 45 cents in 1969 (as it was when it was introduced in 1967), and using The Economist&#x27;s average US price of $4.56 for 2013, we get a roughly 10x increase, so it&#x27;s worth about $1,000 today.<p>That&#x27;s substantially different from the CPI-based value.

I was tired as hell when I wrote that.<p>Judge it as a mix of petty revenge and mindgames if you want, but it helps me to deal with incredibly superficial people just fine. In fact, after making them question their modus operandi, they tend to become a lot more agreeable. Of course I could go the regular route of either ignoring them, putting up with them or agressively lashing out at them, but at the end, that doesn&#x27;t improve the situation for anyone. They&#x27;ll go their merry ways, irritating everyone.<p>And before that transition happens, they&#x27;ll strain very hard to put you in a box, and that&#x27;s kinda cute.<p>Anyways, you&#x27;re good at quips, I tip my propeller hat.",1376614999

There is authenticity and uniqueness in the things people do <i>despite</i> their soul killing jobs, but what&#x27;s authentic about, say, selling your body? I find this just as condescending, sorry: If those people complain, i.e. if they say it sucks for them, then it sucks for them. Talking about authenticy and uniqueness, and pretending they have much a of a choice, is respecting a strawman (i.e. decisions they never got to make), while disrespecting their actual situation.",1376614996

The previous six years were a mix of freelance, contract, and startup work -- sometimes full-time, sometimes way-more-than-full-time, and sometimes not at all... but usually part-time.<p>There are some things I like about the current job, and if I stick around at least another six months, I&#x27;ll likely play a key role in overhauling the front end of a major automaker&#x27;s website using state-of-the art. Not a bad feather to stick in a cap.<p>On the other hand, the chances that I&#x27;ll do anything else in the meanwhile seem pretty slim. I notice in the last year alone, my energy for original/personal projects is diminished, I feel less creative/thoughtful in general -- and arguably even less <i>interesting</i> than during the aforementioned freelance period. I do feel, as Bukowski put it, somewhat emptied out by my work.<p>It&#x27;s possible what I really need is a different full-time gig, since I have been in some full-time situations that felt energizing. But I&#x27;m starting to be convinced that when I&#x27;m hiring myself out part-time, I stay more personally grounded <i>and</i> sharper as far as my general skills and strength in the field goes.<p>Unfortunately, steady skilled part-time employment seems to be considerably more difficult to find than full-time.",1376614819

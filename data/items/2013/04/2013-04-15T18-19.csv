My point is simply that there could be multiple masters being served here by these policies.

There is no material difference in these tradeoffs between a prisoner in Gitmo and a prisoner in the US other than the <i>legal</i> rights being afforded the prisoner.<p>Instead, they try to say ""well, they are in gitmo for a reason"". This is actually completely irrelevant to preventing the next terrorist attack.  Either you need to torture them/deprive them/render them/whatever or you don't. The fact that they are in Gitmo does not change this.<p>The only thing closing down Gitmo or not closing down Gitmo does is allow certain folks to try to play fast and loose with the legal and political realities around us having a constitution and being a nation of laws.<p>As an example:
We find a guy.  He may or may not have been complicit in terrorism (he was a driver for a bad person).  He may know the location/time of the next terrorist attack.<p>Torturing him (or not), detaining him forever (or not) certainly presents complex tradeoffs.  None of these tradeoffs change whether I put him in Gitmo or not.<p>The only thing putting him in Gitmo does is:<p>1. Often make us feel better<p>2. Allow you to try to deny him what would otherwise be various rights he would have if kept in the US<p>3. Keep him out of sight and out of mind, and enable you to more strongly control the public narrative about the guy.<p>As you can see, none of these are related to the complex tradeoffs involved in deciding what to do with them, only the <i>legalities</i> of those tradeoffs, and ability to convince the public of those tradeoffs.  We should not play fast and loose with these legalities, we should be straightforward and clear, and accept the consequences.<p>So, if the argument is ""well, if we close Gitmo, to get the same effect we'd have to make torture/deprivation/indefinite detention legal in some cases in the US"" (which is what you seem to be saying), we've already got a problem, and it's not related to closing down Gitmo or not.<p>If we want to declare torture and indefinite detention is okay in certain cases, that should be a national discussion we have, because, as you said, it involves complex tradeoffs.<p>Right now, with Gitmo open, it enables a lot of folks to ignore having this national discussion, and thinking hard about which tradeoffs they are willing to accept.<p>This, of course, is why Gitmo is still open.
It's the only available compromise position between the two currently extreme sides around what it is okay to do to in the situations you posit that doesn't involve either of them really losing.",1366049559

We've all read the Hack News posts about how no amount of programming can compensate for a poor personality.  Image that you're looking at an applicant and their former employer tells you:<p>""He was a good coder, but he had a serious anger management problem. You should do code reviews over the phone if you don't want books thrown at your head.""<p>You're probably not going to hire this candidate.<p>Now, imagine that you're a manager who has a great, professional programmer who is leaving your organization.  When other companies call for a reference, you could tell the truth, causing your competitors to hire her and their business to improve.  On the other hand, you can make up a story about poor inter-personal skills and keep this talented worker out of the workforce.  If you can't have her, no one can.  On the reverse side, you give glowing recommendations to your worst coders so that their terrible practices fill your opponents sites with massive security holes and performance bottlenecks.  As an added bonus, when your current employees figure out that they'll have a hard time finding a new job after working for you, you can keep their salaries below market rate.<p>Now, this won't work in the long term, since you'll eventually gain a reputation as a liar and your recommendations will be ignored.  However, as long as you remain small, it will take you quite a long time to get this reputation.  Is the CEO of FerriDyne systems honest or a liar?  Meanwhile, you can keep a promising employee out of the job market for six months until they come crawling back for their old job at a fraction of their old pay.<p>This technique also makes recruiting difficult, since your employees won't recommend their competent friends for new positions.  On the other hand, you can just get in the habit of hiring other people with large gaps in their record.  If they're incompetent, then you let them go and recommend them to your competitors.  If they're good, you hire them on at a discount since they haven't been able to find a job in six months.<p>Granted, I'd never do this and I'm sure you wouldn't either.  It's underhanded and, ultimately, irrational.  Lying leads to a breakdown of trust that weakens the whole financial system.

These languages are great for heuristics and analysis but you would really want all 'static' components such as connectivity built in assembly/C/C++.  For 'algo' components I like Java as you can still pull microsecond order latencies when crunching numbers but more importantly it gives you a huge time to market advantage than the C/C++ for almost the same speeds.  I'm also not clear on if you are connecting directly to the market for market data or using aggregation (like reuters). The latter would be too slow.  I'm also not clear on what middleware you are using which is probably the biggest decision you will have to make.  Most either use inhouse tech or 29west LBM (everyone still calls it that even though they were bought out).<p>An overlooked part of HFT in my experience OS optimisation and even things like TCP bypass (for some components) which can lead to huge speed advantages and end to end latency reductions.  I agree with those about FPGA.. in my experience they really don't come into the equation except for components that rarely change.<p>Anyway a few guys including Martin Thompson have felt similarly to you and initiated the lodestone project (<a href=""http://lodestonefoundation.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lodestonefoundation.wordpress.com/</a>).

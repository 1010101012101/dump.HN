1200026,comment,1199513,1199513,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"""American Empire"", if it could be called such, is one of the most unusual in the history of the world. Firstly, it is not one of direct dominance, as nearly all others in history have been. It is primarily one of mutual beneficial relationships, and most frequently of voluntary associations. Secondly, it is less a dominance relationship and more of a leadership relationship. Why do factories in Malaysia produce Intel processors, because of the power of American military might or because of Intel's innovation and product excellence?<p>America hasn't retained it's position on the top of the economic stack of the world merely out of some abundance of natural resources, military might, or large corporations. Rather, America has proven to be more innovative and more dynamic than the rest of the world, generally by a fair margin. America has germinated and grown not just many of today's largest corporations but many of today's biggest industries. A huge percentage of the Fortune 500 companies didn't even exist 20, or 50 years ago.<p>No country has been able to match that dynamism, nor do any countries look likely to match that dynamism in the near future. The rest of the world is still struggling to break out of business models that would be more familiar in 1950s America, meanwhile America is transitioning to an even more dynamic and innovation centric economic model as startup culture begins to spread and more and more individuals start to see themselves as and become freelancers and founders than mere employees. For that reason alone I think America will probably do just fine and keep its place at the top of the heap in the world economy. That being said, there's plenty of room for everyone in the world to be rich, regardless of where the engine of dynamism in the world rests. I think in the next 20 to 50 years we'll see much of India, South America, and at least coastal China become fully first world societies, with individual income and wealth in the same range as that of America, Western Europe, Japan et al.",1268870357

I have two ideas for getting rid of the last use of them in your last step, but I'm sure they're kosher.<p>1) From the equation x0 + x0 = x0, you don't need inverses, just cancellation. I believe that cancellation is a strictly weaker property.<p>2) From the equation x0 + x0 = x0, note that x0 is the additive identity. Inverses are unique, thus x0 = 0.<p>Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with Peano arithmetic to know if proving either of these statements requires the statement we're trying to prove, that x*0 = 0. I'm more familiar with algebra, where inverses exist axiomatically. But at least we've weakened the hypotheses!",1268869943

Much to their frustration and chagrin, no matter how they tweaked it, the results showing low cost places with good opportunities for high tech jobs strongly favored Texas.<p>Obviously, the data is old.  But I would think Texas is still your best bet for family-friendly prices and access to the tech scene.  The state is quite large, so there are several large cities you could look at.  All you would need to do would be to confirm this general trend, then check out which of the larger cities had the other factors you are looking for.  (I personally would avoid Houston.  It's horribly polluted.  But that's just me.)

You surely won't be buying DACs and such cheaper than Sonos, so your only way to be cheaper is to accept lower margins.  You could maybe carve out a tiny niche at a lower price such that it is not worth it for Sonos to lower their own prices (for fear of lowering their total profits), but I know I would rather be Sonos selling at $800 than a competitor selling a smaller volume at $250.<p>3) A $50 BOM is probably a $250 product.

1) It focuses more on developing entrepreneurs, vs. necessarily companies.  The requirement that you incorporate to graduate is kind of at odds with this, but definitely the curriculum for the first half of the program is compatible with coming up with an idea and launching it within the program.
2) It's compatible with having a day job during the program -- if you have good time management skills, you can keep the day job while attending FI, launching your company, and thus not have to worry about funding.  This is a major differentiator vs. YC.
3) Some of the mentors (IMO Aaron Patzer, Jon Betts-Croix, Ram from A9, and some others) were fucking AMAZING.  It's worth $600 just to see their sessions.

The current implementations of TPM have the potential for massive privacy violations and abuse, but I'm hopeful that projects like OpenCore will eventually lead to open source TPM designs.  In any case, in such a system anti-virus is not even necessary.<p>More complex but less restrictive methods include:<p>(1) Building machine learning algorithms around a set of data that measures the normal operation of the machine.  Because 99.9999999999% of the time Grandma's computer shouldn't be acting as a server.<p>(2) A feedback system built into your antivirsus where users report applications that don't work or have malicious behavior.  Then Grandma can look up the greeting card creator she wants to install and see that 100 users have given the application 5/5 stars over a period of 6 months.  Bonus points for open source applications where people will take the time to audit them for free.<p>There's tons of research in this area and I don't have time to reproduce a complete summery here.  The point is that signature based detection is a method that is not sustainable in the long term because the number of unique malware variants is something that is growing exponentially.  Most people don't even have anti-virus installed, and those that do have to deal with the fact that the AV slows the machine to a crawl.<p>Signature based AV is just a stopgap measure until we can properly implement our operating systems and detection methods.  In the future we will have operating systems with trusted computing bases and detection methods based on behavior and crowd sourcing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module</a>",1268867030

You've got a local one initialized to sensible defaults, and you .merge! it with the param one, and then just use the hash values as your local vars.",1268866982

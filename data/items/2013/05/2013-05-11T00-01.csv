5689356,comment,5688803,5688803,5,0,ikkyu,,,"Haskell looks very interesting but I can't help but ask 'why do I need it?'. Currently I am learning Java since I want to get a jr.developer job later on and Ruby for some scripting and personal projects(maybe even Rails later). So Java is used in industry, Ruby is used in web and metasploit/ronin (something that I like to mess with), but what about Haskell? I am genuinely curious what Haskell can offer. I always see it mentioned on Reddit but I have yet to come across any notable project written with it. Could somebody with experience give me some reasons for me to learn it?",1368233949

Very few org's have the data required to pull it off.<p>And that can be seen in the limitations of Siri, WolframAlpha and IBM's Watson. The human brain takes a decade or more of processing all kinds of data, to build up a language model good enough to have a productive conversation. So even if these companies come up with the better learning algorithms, required to build up a decent language model, the bottle neck will always be access to quality data.<p>Google has the data, but since they are off busy defending their advertising empire, innovation in search and therefore NLP has taken a backseat.<p>For the paradigm shift in NLP to happen, things like Siri, Watson and WolframAlpha would need access to Google scale/quality data.<p>Google can spur things along by building a marketplace around search so people can access the data.",1368233229

In addition, agree to a tolerance - if your revised forecasts suggest you will exceed the tolerance at any point, you will contact the client and give them the option of cancelling the project and paying only for costs already incurred or setting a new higher tolerance.<p>If a client really wants a fixed price contract, consider breaking the project down into smaller, lower risk, very well defined tasks, and contracting each one separately (and only quote later tasks when you have more information available from earlier ones, so you can add tasks for things like a second design iteration).

5689291,comment,5685903,5688759,6,0,ubernostrum,,,"A statically-typed language is one in which (1) names and values both are typed, and the only legal binding of a value to a name is when the type of the value is compatible with the type of the name; (2) all expressions have types, and only values or names of the appropriate type may be used or returned. Often but not always, some form of source-code processing prior to execution will evaluate all types in the program and determine whether these conditions are met.<p>A dynamically-typed language is one in which only values have types, and there are no restrictions by type on what values may be bound to particular names. Expressions may or may not have defined types, and may or may not check these types (some dynamically-typed languages do allow statements to be made about the types of functions, for example; some use these in a ""static-y"" way, while others treat them more as hints for runtime optimization).<p>Strong and weak typing are far less precisely defined. The most broadly-used criterion I've personally seen is that in a strongly-typed language, attempting to perform an operation with values whose types are incompatible with the operation will fail immediately, and will not try to implicitly coerce the values to acceptable types for the operation.<p>Python is generally considered strongly typed, and dynamically typed. There is no consensus that these two labels are incompatible, just as there is no consensus that weak and static typing are incompatible (C is often described as being both statically and weakly typed, for example, due to C's casting and conversion facilities).",1368231952

5689265,comment,5688462,5689047,8,0,tikhonj,,,"Structs are an example of a ""universal construction"" called a <i>product</i>. Other examples of this include cartesian products, logical AND and join in a lattice (e.g. getting the least upper bound of two partially ordered elements).<p>For types, this is defined exclusively based on the functions it has. Roughly speaking, the product of two types A and B is the ""simplest"" structure that has a function to A and a function to B--that is, if you imagine a nice diagram, there is an arrow from A  B to A and an arrow from A  B to B. For structs, these two functions are just field accesses.<p>The notion of ""simplest"" here essentially just means that given any other object C with these criteria--that is, a function to A and a function to B--there has to also exist a function C to A  B. I'm skipping some details, but you should get the general gist.<p>The notion of duality just means taking the above diagram and flipping all the arrows. So the co-product of two types A and B is the ""simplest"" type A + B that has a function from A to A + B and a function from B to A + B. These functions correspond to tagging elements from A or B as appropriate.<p>For logical AND, the dual is logical OR. For getting the least upper bound, the dual is getting the greatest <i>lower</i> bound. And, following that same logic, for structs the dual is tagged unions.<p>I hope that made sense.

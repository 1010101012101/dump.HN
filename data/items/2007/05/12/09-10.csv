But it's also why it has such a bad reputation - PHP makes it easy for novices to build websites with terrible code.<p>PHP is a domian specific language:<p>Of the popular scripting lanaguages, it's the only one  designed specifically for running on web servers. Perl, Ruby and Python are general purpose languages which can also be used for web scripting.<p>In summary, if you want to build efficient, scalable websites then PHP is a very good choice.<p>Some people look down their noses at PHP, but if anyone thinks that PHP is a blub lanaguage then try solving the following puzzle in your favourite language:<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/jobs_puzzles/?puzzle_id=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/jobs_puzzles/?puzzle_id=5</a><p>I've written a solution in PHP which runs in less than one second.<p>The point being, there's no such thing a blub programming languages, only blub programmers :-)<p><p><p>",1178963990

The app was kinda slow initially, but it's getting much better. I read posts on it a couple of times a week now, although I don't necessarily prefer it to traditional forum systems. It seems unfocused at the moment, but I suspect that's largely part of their plan to let the users decide where to take the app.<p>I do agree with bootload that they need to get rid of the second click through layer for topics. That does bug me a bit. Some better visualisation of topics within groups might help too - I feel lost without hierarchical navigation.",1178963088

Choose one tool and get good at using it.<p>I went with Python and Django because :<p>- Python is simple, clean, multi purposes and popular<p>- There are many available libraries ( and it has been helpful to me )<p>- Django is the python framework with the most contributors<p>- Django has good documentation available<p>\n===<p>\nDjango is not the fastest framework but when you'll have to deal with scalability, the solution is to cache and put everything in RAM.<p>Try the tutorial and see if you like it.<p>I needed about 1.5 months to get used to the underlying concepts.<p>My advise is to code as seen in the examples and relax.<p>Don't worry about optimising, they thought about it for you.<p>===<p>Tutorial:<p><a href=""http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/tutorial01/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/tutorial01/</a>",1178961860

If so, why did you take it? I can't speak for you, but I want to guess the money made up for the suckiness, right? So, it seems like if people know what the conditions are in a job before they sign up, isn't it up to the individual to decide whether the money is enough to get them to put up with the sucky conditions?<p>Just curious.",1178960456

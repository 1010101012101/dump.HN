But there can very well be more than one contributing factor.<p>To grasp onto your last statement: Try writing a book when you&#x27;re an unemployed, uneducated mum if she did not have a working welfare system to &quot;break my fall&quot; as she herself put it.<p>It was her effort, but the welfare system made it possible for her to put in that effort.<p>EDIT: Though just for the record, as rich people go she is definitively one of the most sympathetic, not least for the way she has made it exceedingly clear that she believes it is fair for her to pay her taxes in the UK without complaint, given what she believes she owes to the system in the first place - and to the extent that she explicitly hit out at the conservatives for wanting to cut taxes for the rich.",1383559195

This includes a system for synthesizing and verifying F18A code using two different solvers (Z3 and Sketch[4]) as well as a system for automatically partitioning and laying out code over the different cores.

I mean, kudos to you, you will probably attract a lot of skilled developers with this attitude. You will also get almost as much done as someone who does 80-hour weeks.<p>Where I live, <i>by law</i> you&#x27;re not allowed to work more than 40 hours a week. If a company violates this, you can literally go to court and get a summary judgement to get paid for every hour beyond this you worked, plus a 40% bonus for every hour beyond 40 each week.

6667746,comment,6666050,6666331,12,0,vidarh,,,"This idea is way older than Buckminster Fuller. A key aspect of the rise of socialist ideologies from the mid 1800&#x27;s was the view that technology would eventually render poverty &quot;obsolete&quot; by making production so efficient that redistribution would leave everyone able to do largely what they want.<p>E.g. in the German Ideology (1845), Marx wrote: &quot;\nIn communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.\n&quot;<p>But this was not to my knowledge an idea that originated with Marx, but was a general driver behind a range of socialist and proto-socialist ideologies dating back to well before the term socialism came into use.<p>Though to Marx it was one of the reasons for why he saw the fall of capitalism as inevitable: It will, according to him, chase efficiencies due to competition to the point where it will eventually saturate markets at the same time as it seeks to minimize labour and minimize labour costs. Since capitalism is geared towards continuous expansion, he believed this would lead simultaneously to eventual increases in poverty and overproduction as society tries to reconcile a situation where labour becomes less and less necessary while capitalist companies depends on more and more spending.<p>So to Marx, the crisis of increasing economic output coupled with reduced need for labour is what eventually pushes society to a tipping point where Marx argued socialist revolutions becomes not only viable, but necessary (you&#x27;ll note that noe of the countries where people tried to force through revolutions in the name of socialism have been anywhere near this level of development; starting with Lenin, a number of people went through any number of contortions to try to make excuses for how socialist revolutions would be viable in countries that did not meet the criteria set out by Marx, and every one of them have been proven wrong; though of course that does not prove Marx right), and that they will eventually happen with or without help.<p>Marx tacitly admitted that capitalism would be more <i>efficient</i> at growing manufacturing etc., for the very reason that capitalism diverts far fewer resources to welfare. And this is one of the reasons why a well developed capitalist society according to Marx is a pre-requisite for socialism.",1383558762

But, 80 hrs of that? No.<p>If, however, you are doing something you would literally be doing anyway because its &quot;you&quot;, then the number of hours &quot;working&quot; is no longer relevant.

I don&#x27;t know that google is able to find that type of structured info in each news page. Actually a specialized search engine which is focused on date functionality would be invaluable. Maybe someone like archive.org would tackle that. It would be great to search even pre-WWW results, such as historical archives or radio transcripts.",1383557880

If you want a new house or a new car, I think saving money until you have enough is a much nobler way to do it.

Hoarder&#x27;s money will work just the same when he decides to spend them. Thus, what you have to discuss here is not hoarding, but rather &quot;spending now&quot; vs &quot;spending later&quot;.

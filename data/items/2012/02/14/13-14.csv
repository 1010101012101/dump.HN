It is hardly something which attracts fans.<p>What is unique is the level of violence for a team sport - it is the rare college or professional game in which someone is not carted off with an injury that puts them out for at least several weeks.",1329227923

He supported very much to the policies of globalization,liberalization and India became a member of this draconian policy. The poor people of India thought that by this change in economic policy their standard of life will change. But it is very unfortunate that after two decades of its implementation the poor people are ruined now. The marginal farmers are ending their life by taking pesticides and insecticides due to debt. More and more people are coming under below poverty line. Every night some million Indians are going to the bed in empty stomach. Inflation level is increasing day by day. Industrial workers are losing their job on daily basis. On every part of this universe Indians are working as daily wage laborers. Employment is a very big problem.

See other Kotlin examples here:\n<a href=""http://kotlin-demo.jetbrains.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotlin-demo.jetbrains.com/</a>\nKotlin copies much of its design and syntax from earlier Scala versions e.g. the use of companion classes, constructor syntax etc. but leaves out some of the most useful features found in Scala today. Kotlin, unlike Scala cannot make existing classes implement a new interface, nor can it do structural typing (<a href=""http://codemonkeyism.com/scala-goodness-structural-typing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codemonkeyism.com/scala-goodness-structural-typing/</a>).

8724811,comment,8723548,8724003,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>&quot;Enhanced interrogation technique&quot; is an uncontroversial, accurate factual description.</i><p>I disagree. &#x27;Enhanced&#x27; certainly refers to intensification or increase, but also has strongly positive associations. If you experienced two injuries in a row you wouldn&#x27;t normally say that the second one had &#x27;enhanced your pain experience&#x27; - if you did people would assume you were a masochist of some sort. The measure of <i>interrogation</i> is surely in the quality of results it yields; if some technique actually results in a decrease in the quality of intelligence then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a degraded interrogation technique.<p>To the extent that you want a neutral description of an action whose efficacy is unknown, you could say &#x27;aggressive interrogation technique&#x27; or &#x27;intensified interrogation technique&#x27; or any number of other words. Just because &#x27;enhanced&#x27; <i>can</i> be read to mean intensified or increased without necessarily being <i>better</i> does mean it is commonly understood to mean that; when you&#x27;re choosing terms to describe something to the public - and especially when you&#x27;re choosing words for their referential rather than explanatory power - that lowest common denominator of meaning is the one that matters.<p>I appreciate the fine legal distinction that you&#x27;re drawing here in the context of war crimes and so forth, but I suggest to you that phrases like &#x27;enhanced interrogation technique&#x27; are actually part of the problem - deliberate euphemisms chosen primarily for their anodyne qualities.",1418151382

8724787,comment,8720835,8720835,0,0,RestlessMind,,,">... when someone at a very early stage startup approached me....<p>> When the developer mentioned her pregnancy as a negative to her potential employment, I immediately froze up and didn’t know how to handle the situation. It felt like I was supposed to agree that she might not be as dedicated or invested in the role because of her status as a mother.<p>I have a genuine question about this - &quot;very early stage startups&quot; seem to be the kind of places where every single employee can make or break the company. Are pregnant women a really right fit for such setting? I am a father myself and after watching my wife over the last few years of her pregnancy + motherhood, I can see the following reasons where pregnant women and an early stage startup can be a bad mismatch:<p>1. Women are allowed to take 15-17 weeks of leave in CA by law (2-4 weeks before delivery, 13 weeks after). If one of your employee is unavailable for ~4 months, won&#x27;t that affect an early stage startup?<p>2. Early stage companies seem to be a high stress environment (my first hand experience, maybe anecdotal), where as pregnant women 
/ new moms are advised rest (or at least avoid stress).<p>I might have my own startup one day, when I can come across candidates who are pregnant. So it would be good to know if there is any flaw in my thinking, or if I have missed anything.",1418151102

It&#x27;s a 1&quot; hole in the face of a 5.5&quot; member (2x6). In structural engineering plans that I&#x27;ve seen (see below) that would be allowed (for certain placements) w/o explicit permission of the engineer. From that I deduce that such sized holes do not substantially weaken the member. But perhaps there is more to it. Also consider that a larger bolt means the wood-metal interface is spread over a larger area, so lower pressure - perhaps reduces splitting?<p>>With lag bolts you could actually inspect everything with a torque wrench and the correct size of socket and that would work just fine.<p>True, but unless the lumber is pre-dried, it will shrink after construction. Whether it be lags, hex bolts, or screws, it will need rechecking after the wood settles.<p>All that said, I too would not have used 1&quot; bolts. Seems like 1/2&quot; or 5/8&quot; would suffice. But my main objection to 1&quot; is that it&#x27;s overkill, and engineering is, after all, the science of achieving the stated objectives with the least resources. I&#x27;d love to see the calcs and assumptions of the professional engineer who mandated the 1&quot; bolts.<p>From some structural engineering plans for a house:<p><i>Do not cut, bore or notch wood members expect where show in the details. Maximum holes at studs to be 0.4x width of stud. Maximum hole diameter at beam joist or rafter to be depth x 0.25, or 2 inches whichever is smaller, and are to be places within the middle third of span. Holes not permitted when depth is 4 inches or less. All other holes require engineers approval</i>",1418151052

When SOAP first came on the scene, complicated AJAX based applications were not typical.  But as more and more JSON/HTTP APIs emerged in conjunction with browsers becoming more powerful and rich apps build built in them, the meaninglessness & complexity of SOAP grew.<p>Also, another major issue with SOAP is that most all of the popular tools would generate classes based on a WSDL.   This creates a toolchain issue that is readily solved for someone experienced, but can really suck if you are new to the idea of generated code working it&#x27;s way into your project.<p>Much worse was the scenario of WSDL versioning in conjunction with these tools that generated classes.  If the API never broke backwards compatibility, you should be OK and can just use the newer class representations, counting on the service and tools to deal with null fields appropriately (not always true unfortunately).    But if version bumps of an API/WSDL broke backwards compatibility... then you had to have separate class hierarchies for different versions of the WSDL; what an intense headache.  Contrast that to web REST APIs; without a formal schema and a lack of class-centric tooling, client libraries would often let the author stuff in the params themselves and let the serializer stuff in the body based on the params; so yes your API is not as formal, but this isn&#x27;t a big issue but offers infinite flexibility in dealing with one-off versioning issues or interop issues.<p>As someone else mentioned, some platforms couldn&#x27;t interop with others (differences as it related to simply stuff like nullable fields or primitives existed all over; total nightmare), and some features of WSDLs didn&#x27;t translate well to certain languages.<p>A great WSDL author would know to make their WSDL as simple as possible, because they had spent time working with various language toolchains and new the limitations out there, but that&#x27;s asking way too much and not realistic for someone to have to spend all their time trying to understand all the ways someone in language XYZ might use their WSDL.",1418149873

In my experience, SOAP services are okay plug-and-play if you own both the provider and the consumer. But consuming external APIs can be nightmarish, especially with SOAP 1.2. SOAP exists in our organization for legacy reasons but we recommend all new consumers use RESTful services.<p>Our mobile clients like REST because it&#x27;s faster and easier to consume from outside the .NET platform than SOAP. Even within the .NET platform, a client can get up and running consuming a &quot;RESTful&quot; service in fewer lines of code than a SOAPy one. Not only SOAP tooling, but HTTP client tooling in general, is a lot easier to use these days.<p>WSDLs are cool because they are a fairly standard metadata format. Our clients like them because they can perform data validation with proxy/firewall systems before the request ever enters the corporate network. I&#x27;ve yet to see a concrete benefit from that kind of strictness, though. IMO, SOAP schema validation is so brittle that it causes more problems than it fixes.<p>Of course, you can also use non-SOAP document description formats like RAML for describing your RESTful services. It&#x27;s not like SOAP offers anything you can&#x27;t get for REST. But once you start adding all that on top of your REST API stack, you might as well use SOAP 1.1. (Never use SOAP 1.2).<p>I don&#x27;t think the main problem with SOAP is that it&#x27;s over-engineered, although it is. The issue is that the supposed benefit of &quot;interoperability&quot; was never really realized. It&#x27;s supposedly protocol-agnostic, but nobody cares.

It was not my fault and if I was in a car, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have been hurt at all. Roughly a year after the accident, I started to ride the motorbike again, albeit not that often. I don&#x27;t see anything I could easily improve with the driving style to reduce the risk. I think I&#x27;m already quite defensive both on the motorcycle and in the car and I try to always remind myself that I&#x27;m no expert.<p>Maybe I don&#x27;t correctly evaluate the risk or I just assign too much value to the benefits I get. It&#x27;s very hard to calculate with a cost of own life. Moreover this cost is changing. It can temporarily increase for example when you support a family. But how do you account for the fact that you have a finite amount of time here no matter what you do? There are much less risky things to do and also much riskier ones than riding a motorbike. Are all the people who take more than the smallest possible amount of risk crazy or unable to assess the values? Honestly, I still don&#x27;t know.",1418149559

I mention the salary only because you mention you aren&#x27;t a young fresh out of college person, so I would guess you have some real bills and possibly a family.  After about 6 months of work you will need to be on the track to raising your next round as well to get money in place at month 12-14.  This all assumes you have never raised before and so have no proven track record using someone else&#x27;s money, and of course is just my opinion.<p>An incubator might be a good idea if you can find one that will take you as solo founder, again not impossible but they play to the VC&#x27;s desires.<p>Some other ideas/points,<p>1: look for traditional angel money outside of just the well known SV firms, people etc.  High net worth people invest in companies fairly often and usually are more personally involved in the deal (not in a bad way) and many times are a little more flexible with founder salary if that is needed.<p>2: Bootstrap a little longer and pay a developer part time to help you meet the other goals.  If you have a full time position now take $1,500-$2,500 of what you are making monthly and spend it on hiring part time help to get some of the stuff over the finish line before going after money.  Either way this moves the ball further down the path so that if  you go after money you are that much better off.<p>3: Definitely put it up on AngelList.<p>4: Don&#x27;t focus on a PR firm, they generally are expensive and a waste of money for early traction.  We worked with a startup this summer that spent well over $100k of their money on a PR firm that got them less exposure then did spending $2,500 on a 30 second video and spreading it through friends, family and social media sites.  As well the founder figured out that by contacting reporters and bloggers directly the response he received was way better than having the PR firm do it, and all it cost him was a few hours every week talking to these people.<p>5: Update your website, right now it looks like a side project that isn&#x27;t getting a lot of love.  The website is the first impression people see of you and your service/product.  If it looks poorly, so will your chances with converting the client.

I&#x27;m not familiar with the details, but I believe that Upstart development was primarily one person prior to the decision to switch to systemd. Supporting existing stable releases surely requires far less. So it&#x27;s hardly an onerous burden.<p>There is also the question of supporting packages that integrate with Upstart (eg. via Upstart init script), so this involves some more work as we&#x27;ll be supporting packages that use Upstart (in 14.04) as well as systemd (from Vivid, if we complete the switch this cycle).<p>But I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so much work as to be considered a contributing factor in &quot;spreading themselves so thin&quot;.

Its job is to present a file system to each process built from mounting virtual file systems from all sorts of programs and remote machines.<p>Wow, that sounds really powerful. I&#x27;ve just read a bit about inter-process communication and sharing in Linux, and that seems like much more of a hassle than this.<p>> Even the editor acme has its own file system, which makes writing a script doing something fancy in my editor really easy. The file system gives easy access (read/write) to anything from the currently selected text in each window, to the &quot;menu&quot; at the top (called the tag). And if I write a script, it is executed anywhere in acme by middle clicking its name.<p>That sounds like it might be the answer (an answer) to something I&#x27;ve been wondering about: how to let another process - outside the editor - have access to the contents of the editor. Like for example synchronizing the editing/viewing of a file, instead of the outside process only using the file stored on the disk, and reloading whenever the editor saves the file. Could one use the file system of Acme to have another process view for example the file that it is being used to edit, in real time? I&#x27;m thinking that something like that might be useful for collaborative editing (at the least, letting one person edit the file while the other person watches the editing, maybe in the same kind of editor but hopefully through whichever editor or program that she wishes to use).",1418148911

Many frameworks actively encourage a monolithic architecture through conventions, all to increase productivity during the initial construction phase of a project. If you&#x27;re sprinting to launch a project, modularity and loose coupling matter a lot less than sheer productivity to churn out as many features as quickly as possible. Rails was designed with this mindset and it excels in it more than any other framework out there.<p>Refactoring to modularity and loose coupling down the road after choosing something like Rails is non-trivial, especially when compared to the rapid pace the development team enjoys in the early stages of using the framework. So one needs to be aware of that before diving in.<p>Other lightweight tools like Node.js front load the cost of modularity by forcing you to design on your own conventions early on.

I do spend a fair amount of time programming in a way that makes it less likely I&#x27;ll have to debug (asserting contracts, implementing tests). Whacking out some random spaghetti code, then spending days navigating it isn&#x27;t productive.<p>And secondly, thinking about the recent projects I&#x27;ve worked on, the debugging I have done has not been about finding where a variable got the wrong value. The only day-sapping bugs I&#x27;ve had recently have been figuring out why some piece of code performs an incorrect calculation; and figuring out how to ensure the correct order of different operations. The latter I suspect would have been more difficult in an FP with a more complex stack trace and tail call elimination. Most of the smaller debugging problems I have relate to impedance mismatches between my code and 3rd party libraries.<p>Library interface problems seem less in FP, but mostly because there are fewer libraries. It is easy to make a totally understandable, simple, programming environment if you never have to do any heavy lifting with other people&#x27;s code.<p>I program in FP, but a lot of the time I end up in OO languages with good library, tool, testing and debugging support.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think this is another case of FP-zealots interpreting the world in a way that maximises the problem they know how to solve.",1418148190

Mr. X By Carl Sagan
This account was written in 1969 for publication in Marihuana Reconsidered (1971). Sagan was in his mid-thirties at that time.

Russell Ambrose (a pseudonym) is a musician: aged 47, composer, jazzer, conductor, teacher.

Marijuana Stimulates Creativity and Enriches Experience
By Jon Byrne, MD
Dr. Byrne has, on and off, explored the role of cannabis in enhancing consciousness and enriching experience since his late teenage years. After attending a top five medical school, he came to San Francisco to undergo residency training at UCSF and currently lives and practices medicine in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a successful part-time researcher, he has published in prominent journals and has frequently presented his work at national meetings. (Jon Byrne is a pseudonym).",1215488917

I'm with PG on this one, if he wants to think hackers are like painters then he can. If someone wants to write that they are not alike, then they can, which will presumably be refuted by another PG essay on why they are, in fact, alike. Either way, hackers and painters can be like lots of other people, because its a free world and everyone can make up their own damn simile if they please.<p>In PG's defense, the critic tried to actually disprove the simile. Unfortunately, as he himself pointed out, hackers can be like painters in that they are both makers. The critic then goes on to say they are nothing like each other, having just pointed out that PG came up with something where they are, in fact, like each other. When you're writing an article disproving something someone said, its not wise to disprove yourself as well. It just makes reading it a big waste of time.",1215488069

Shit, Shulgin has 3 whole books, which, in addition to being keys from an extraterrestrial into the ways our brain works and we experience ourselves, are also recipes for unique psychedelics.<p>I could imagine people could make a lot more money then doing your legal shit a lot faster by making those analogues and distributing them at high price to the real heads that hang out at places like Alex Grey art shows or consciousness or AI conferences.  You'd make a lot of money by knowing a few interesting people and supplying their scientific and artistic circles with these analogues.  You could write a very interesting thesis on the results.  And, you'd be advancing science a great deal.<p>In theory of course.  We would never expect authentic scientists and hackers to break the boundaries the authority system have prescribed for them.  A good scientist will always obey the authorities, and only look in the allowed places for knowledge about how the world works.  Any new lens with which we might perceive reality will be brushed under the rug.   In fact, we will always bow down to power and aggressively attack anyone who conflicts with the normal way of looking at the world, just like the original scientists did (huh?).

I have one friend who is a true apple fan-boy and finishes his phone contract early so he can get the latest iPhone earlier at much cost etc.<p>I recently finished an app and said - hey, do you mind downloading it for me and checking it out? He says, &quot;but it costs £1?!&quot; I said, &quot;ok, no worries, I&#x27;ll GIVE you the £1 right now&quot;<p>He still said &quot;No&quot;. Why? Because &quot;he never spends money on apps.&quot; Weird, right?<p>Then last night I&#x27;m watching Horizon - &quot;How we make decisions&quot; [1], and they talked about how when we feel we are ahead we are much more cautious than when we feel we are behind, when we experience &quot;loss aversion&quot; and are more likely to take a gamble.<p>I wonder if this is the best way to monetize apps. So you offer the app for free (no risk at all), then instead of offering &quot;add-ons&quot;, you offer to remove &quot;restrictions&quot;, implying that the user is already behind and they should take the gamble to get back to their &quot;free&quot; app.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10658646/Horizon-How-You-Really-Make-Decisions-review.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-r...</a>",1393322375

The goal of NCD is to allow hackers to <i>program</i> their network config however they want, not just in ways foreseen and implemented by their declarative config system.<p>NCD can already react to many kinds of events, including the basic network stuff (interface appeared/disappeared, cable plugged in/out), input devices (via evdev) as well as an IPC protocol which works with structured data (for GUIs and CLI control).<p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/wiki/NCD"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/wiki/NCD</a>",1393322367

As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s common to sell downgraded parts at lower price points, just to be able to compete at those price points as well. In <i>theory</i> they could&#x27;ve just dropped the price for 64GB cards, and killed all cards with less capacity -- that would at least have made more (apparent to consumers) sense than sell all cards at the same (cost+margin) price.<p>I speculate that as manufacturing processes have gotten better, several segments of the industry simply continue to follow the old pattern of lower performance/lower price (GBs of flash, frequency of processors) from processes that did produce &quot;quantifiable&quot; low yields (eg: disabled core that didn&#x27;t pass q/a, unreliable flash etc).<p>As for re-enabling flash on lower capacity cards, I remember seeing a reference to some people being able to flash/reprogram/reconfigure SSD drives for higher capacity -- not sure about sdcards. Also not sure if that was just to alter the reported capacity, or actually enabled more flash on the drive -- I can&#x27;t find the article right now.<p>Given stuff like:<p><a href=""http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554</a><p>It doesn&#x27;t seem too far fetched that it&#x27;s possible.",1393322272

Post war Hong Kong was economically driven by 80% government housing which in turn reduced the cost of employees (who didn&#x27;t have to pay huge rent or mortgages). some smart state will realise this and compete in international businesses like tech. imagine the attraction for the youth if the next silicon valley had government provided housing.",1393321623

How do I determine which of these 30 applications has the best value/cost balance?<p>Isn&#x27;t straight-up downloads, because who knows how many of those people still use the app. Isn&#x27;t necessarily rating, because we know those responses don&#x27;t really answer the big question.<p>A small curated market solves the hard question (which is most valuable for the price?) but short-cutting the question. The user doesn&#x27;t need to ask or research, because by the nature of having a small, curated marketplace, the marketplace organizers rely on their own credibility as curators.<p>Like the news industry, whose job it was to curate the news, eventually a few small curators float to the top and then attract more quality curators, growing that marketplace.<p>But it&#x27;s still inherently weak, because you&#x27;re still not supporting the user answering their own question - which of these has the best value for the cost?",1393321454

The fact we have spacecraft in distant orbits which will remain exactly as they are for centuries or millenia is surely a much greater monument (albeit one which is hard to find). Our major cities (which are so entrenched that even if they were abandoned today would exist in some form for centuries, and certainly be easily identified for millenia) are vast monuments of human achievement.

To prove that open access is worse than close access, you need to do experiments comparing both, not just do experiments on open access and say the results are bad. Try imagining a study using the same methodology to show that American journals are bad.<p>2. Even assuming that open-access journals on average are worse than closed-access journals, it does not follow that all open-access journals are crap. I think it is safe to say that 80% of all publications venues are crap regardless of their access policy. Fortunately, scientists usually do not choose a venue at random among open-access or closed-access ones, they pick those that have a good reputation. So to establish that open access is bad you should do so by evaluating the right venues.<p>To give another analogy, this is like looking at random emails in transit, observing that they are spam, and concluding that email is worse than Twitter, without observing anything on Twitter, or taking into account the fact that people are not reading random emails.<p>I think this study does exemplify the fact (well-known among scientists) that there is a huge mass of low-quality publication venues with little or no review of the submissions, but branding it as &quot;open access is bad!&quot; can only be explained by further political motives.",1393319381

If they were to introduce those features, they would have to do it at release 1, not 10 years later. They agreed it would have made the platform better, but now it&#x27;s too late.<p>As for the &quot;deep architectural&quot; changes required, Roslyn is indeed that change. But the team was very clear on wanting to deliver in stages. 1: Deliver the new compiler and then 2: later when it all has proven to work well, <i>then</i> start using this new architecture to deliver new features.",1393319021

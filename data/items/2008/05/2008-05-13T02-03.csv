You definitely need a teacher, and consider focusing on the spoken language if most of your communication will be verbal.<p>Korean is useful because very few Westerners speak it.

necessary documentations evidencing your claim purported to have been
signed personally by you prior to the release of your contract fund valued

your fund to the Bank informationโ€™s which was forwarded to them by
the
above named Lady, so that was the main reason why they contacted us so as
to assist them in making the investigations.<p>They further informed us that we should warn our dear citizens who must

obv it has great use too.<p>the big economies of the future are speculated to be:
china - mandarin
india - ok english we all know
brazil - portugese, also some african countries have portugese a s alanguage
nigeria - english<p>if you dont want the tough ones(mandarin, russian) and spanish you are already learning then i dont know how big the use is but:
  french, portugese, german<p>i would probably learn spanish really well instead of learning yet another one with limited use.<p>i mean knowing to speak just the basics of a language doesnt really help you with anything except when you travel.<p>but im hardly an expert on the matter.",1210644705

Pursuing one theoretical framework may make some issues either disappear or be invisible (like garbage collection makes the issue of memory management appear to disappear -- but it still has to be done at some level, and this causes new issues, as evidenced by many talks given and books written about how to deal with $LANGUAGEs garbage-collector) but that doesn&#x27;t mean that you won&#x27;t have issues remaining or even create new issues.<p>You call &quot;Aversion to Extremes&quot; a cognitive bias that doesn&#x27;t work well in practice, but you should realize that the opposite is true; the more extreme a language pursues a theoretical concepts, the less used it typically ends up being in practice. For every success-story you can give me about Agda (pursues dependent typing), haskell (pursues functional purity) or smalltalk (pursues object-orientedness) I can give you a thousand success-stories of people using C++, java or C#.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine that you will be able to come up with any measure of &quot;how well something works in practice&quot; that is remotely sensible and makes these &quot;purity-oriented&quot; languages appear to &quot;work better in practice&quot;. The reality of programming is just that there are many different requirements one might have to a language and its implementation, and properties that are <i>very</i> clear advantages in a theoretical framework seldomly translate to practical benefits in a nontrivial way.<p>A nice example (IMO) of a language that pursues functional programming without attempting to be needlessly pure about it is erlang; each &quot;process&quot; itself is written in a functional language that promotes separation of side-effects and communication, but from a &quot;further up&quot; perspective, each process is like an object, holding onto state. That way it gains the [for erlang] important advantages of having functional traits, while not sacrificing flexibility through needlessly strictly adhering to the functional paradigm.",1398599696

7654770,comment,7653274,7653274,3,0,tokenadult,,,"What&#x27;s with the spate of press releases from hospitals in Canada recently here on Hacker News? One statement in the press release seems frankly incredible to this father of four children in the United States: &quot;Not so long ago, obstetricians would tell women to take it easy and rest during their pregnancy. Recently, the tides have turned and it is now commonly accepted that inactivity is actually a health concern.&quot; What is the definition of &quot;not so long ago&quot; here? My wife exercised (rather more vigorously than what&#x27;s described in the press release) during all four pregnancies with our children, the first of which was more than twenty years ago. (Our oldest son is now a hacker in New York City.) It would never have occurred to us to do otherwise, and we lived in Seattle, Washington; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Taipei, Taiwan as our children were expected and born, and in all those places it seemed to be recommended for expectant mothers to exercise during pregnancy.<p>What has changed over twenty years in the United States are weight gain recommendations for pregnant women. As our first son was in utero, the recommended weight gain figures for pregnant women were at the peak that they ever reached. My wife, while exercising moderately but more vigorously than described in the submission here, also dutifully ate far more than she usually eats, and managed to gain up to the full recommended weight gain of that era. Later, the weight gain recommendations were actually revised downwards again. (Whew!) My petite and formerly rather slim wife ends up after four pregnancies with a baseline weight, more than a decade after her last child was born, heavier than she ever was before having children, but still at the low part of the &quot;normal&quot; body mass range for women in the United States, and she still exercises, more vigorously than ever. (She bicycle-commutes year-round here in Minnesota, and we do a lot of our discussion of family business on walks to do grocery shopping or visits to the library that involve us carrying objects home for a mile along our city trail system.)<p>On the whole, I&#x27;m rather astonished that as of the date of this press release submission (LUNDI, 11 NOVEMBRE 2013) there could be any controversy in any part of Canada that the kind of exercise described in the article could be anything but beneficial for expectant mothers and their children. How fast does news about better prenatal care spread around the world? I know that the place where we live, Minnesota, is ahead of the world curve in obstetric practice (indeed, my late father was present for my birth and the birth of two of my three siblings, very unusually for that era, beginning in the 1950s), but I didn&#x27;t think after living in two countries and having children in both that ANYWHERE doubted the benefit of exercise by pregnant women.<p>AFTER EDIT: I&#x27;ll add here some links to official statements about exercise for pregnant women.<p>&quot;Physical Activity: Healthy Pregnant or Postpartum Women&quot; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/pregnancy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/preg...</a><p>&quot;Exercise During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period&quot; by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists:<p><a href=""http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Obstetric_Practice/Exercise_During_Pregnancy_and_the_Postpartum_Period"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opi...</a><p>&quot;Exercise in pregnancy&quot; by National Health Service (Britain):<p><a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/pregnancy-exercise.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/pregna...</a>",1398599661

7654766,comment,7652925,7654534,4,0,tormeh,,,"Money is a leaky abstraction. What epicureanideal was really saying is that everyone&#x27;s potential to create things or services of value to other people increase. Assuming people act on this potential and the monetary base stays constant  we will get deflation. Of course, Uber and AirBnB are partly replacing taxi rides and hotel rooms - the total amount of rides and rooms for hire will stay more or less constant. So deflation for that reason is unlikely. It&#x27;s not about the value of money overall.<p>But what are taxi drivers or hotel staff going to do? They can lower their prices (and thereby limit Uber/ArBnB) or they can do something else. Probably something less enjoyable and/or lower paying, or they would already be doing it. So money moves from professionals to hobbyists and the firms that organize the hobbyist movements. But who are the hobbyists really? Not millionaires, I would bet. The Uber drivers may be hotel staff and the AirBnB hoteliers may be taxi drivers. People who need money, in other words. So lower-class services get less expensive, low-class people get less purchasing potential and the potential go to the middle-upper class people at Uber/AirBnB directly, and to other trades not suited for hobbyisation indirectly.<p>It doesn&#x27;t look very good.",1398599604

7654742,comment,7654601,7654665,10,0,PaulAJ,,,"Its an example of the &quot;blub paradox&quot;: if you haven&#x27;t used a pure functional language then its hard to see what the problem is.<p>The crucial thing about pure functional languages is that they decouple the logic of the program from the order of the computation. In an imperative language control flow and data flow are explicitly interleaved, with complex dependencies between the two. In many cases a particular bit of code is only correct if another bit of code has been executed previously, and its up to the programmer to keep track of all these dependencies.<p>In a pure functional language this coupling between data flow and control flow is broken because all the data dependencies are made explicit and visible to both the compiler and the programmer. That frees the programmer from bothering about it (and automating low level programming issues is always a Good Thing), and it also enables the compiler to optimise it. So for instance in Haskell the compiler will rewrite this expression<p><pre><code>    map f (map g xs)\n</code></pre>\ninto this<p><pre><code>    map (f . g) xs\n</code></pre>\nThe first line would iterate through the list &quot;xs&quot;, building up an intermediate result list by applying &quot;g&quot; to every element. It would then iterate through this intermediate list applying &quot;f&quot; and building up the result.<p>The second line iterates through the list only once, applying &quot;g&quot; and then &quot;f&quot; to each element in turn. Haskell can do this because &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are guaranteed by the type system to have no side effects, so it doesn&#x27;t matter what order they are executed in. In impure languages the order of execution matters, so the compiler can&#x27;t switch things around in this way without changing the meaning of the program.<p>The programmer also gets the benefit. If you see &quot;x = complexThing&quot; you can always replace &quot;x&quot; with &quot;complexThing&quot; and vice-versa anywhere that &quot;x&quot; is in scope, without changing the meaning of your program. That makes it much easier to reason about what your program does.",1398599054

That first version was indeed pretty simple to patch (decompile, find a class with a method that ran a bunch of license checks, and just replace that bit with &quot;return true&quot; then rebuild the JAR).  Then they released another version with more serious obfuscation applied to it.  I found myself digging through classfile specs, writing my own code to edit classes directly (where decompilers failed), etc..  As obfuscators evolved (and they upgraded), it got more interesting.<p>I bought a license after a while (and I certainly didn&#x27;t distribute my cracked versions; I liked the tool and wanted to support them), but I kept cracking new versions when they came out for a few years; it was entertaining & highly educational.<p>I worked for a while on a standalone classfile editor, but eventually ran out of time for the hobby.  But along the way I learned a good amount about Java bytecode, how the VM interpreted it (and how much flexibility there actually was involved).  I learned about UTF-8 (and realized quickly that most text editors didn&#x27;t seem to actually support it properly), put quite a lot of thought into security (trickier than I had thought) and how it relates to program flow (e.g., good design can easily mean more-easily-bypassed security).<p>The real downside is that I couldn&#x27;t brag about it to my colleagues, or online -- I didn&#x27;t want to tangle with any potential legal issues, or reputation problems, especially at the start of my career.<p>So I&#x27;d be walking around, buzzing with the new stuff I&#x27;d figured out (and new obstacles surmounted), but unable to say a word about it to anyone who would know what I was talking about.

The idea was to give journalists laptops on which they could write short items (about 100 words on the fly while they were actually in conference sessions - if Bill Gates said something interesting at the Keynote we could have it published in 3 minutes. The journalist would type the story into a structured Web form,  hit send and the story would go to an editor for proof reading, who would then publish. The item would appear not only on the Web, but would be formatted for Palm Pilots: We had a bespoke app people could install on their handhelds and sync-stations around the show floor for them to plug them in and get news stories squirted into their machines when they wanted.<p>In the pre-Twitter, 3G world, where mobile Internet meant WEP this was a quite advanced.

A more appropriate example would be for a family to own a second or a third car. If you own a second car, you have one more item that you own but don&#x27;t absolutely need, therefore an item that provides financial security and independence because you can sell it when in need of money (even if at a lower value, it&#x27;s still a way to get instant cash for an emergency). This is the kind of financial security that will allow you to show your boss the middle finger or ask for a bigger wage, because you know that that if you get fired you can still get by until you find another job, or you have enough stuff to sell and move to another place even if you bank accounts get frozen etc.<p>This is good because:<p>1. it make people less likely to accept a lower wage, driving wages up<p>2. it makes people with very risky but innovative ideas willing to start a business from their garage, because they know they still have enough savings to not end up homeless if everything goes south (note: I&#x27;m referring to the kind of ideas <i>no sane VC would throw a penny at</i>, but might very well change the world)<p>3. it makes people give more to charity, in two ways: (a) most people donate at some time the things that they buy but not use and (b) the fact that you &quot;own stuff&quot; gives you a sense of security that makes you worry less about your future and care more about the needs of others (dunno how healthy this way of thinking is, but this is how our minds work)<p>I know it&#x27;s not a fashionable mindset, but I think that <i>owning more</i>, <i>sharing less</i> and <i>giving (away) more</i> (or reselling at way-below-market prices, which is close enough to it and doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone&#x27;s pride :)... ) is a much healthier, financially secure and more freedom promoting way of living than what we seem to encourage today!

7654710,comment,7654601,7654601,30,0,PaulAJ,,,"The software engineering world is in danger of repeating the mistake it made with objects two decades ago.<p>Back then there were legacy &quot;structured&quot; languages like C and Ada, and new exciting &quot;object oriented&quot; languages like Smalltalk and Eiffel. C++ was promoted as a &quot;middle way&quot; that let you &quot;choose the best tool for the job&quot;. This made the pure OO languages look extremist. So, it was argued, if you had a problem best solved by structured programming you could do that, and if you were doing an application with objects in it then you could use those. It also meant that your old C programmers could pick up the tool and start using it immediately without having to relearn how to design a program.<p>&quot;Aversion to Extremes&quot; is a well-known cognitive bias, and these arguments play up to it, but of course it didn&#x27;t work well in practice.  OO features didn&#x27;t dovetail neatly with the existing structured features, leading to an exponential explosion in the rules defining how the various features interacted. The mess was not helped by experienced structured programmers who felt they should use the new sexy OO features; the result was often a conventional structured design with some random virtual functions sprinkled around.<p>The book &quot;Industrial Strength C++&quot; is a case in point. It is basically a catalogue of C++ language features that interact in dangerous ways.\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Industrial-Strength-Recommendations-Innovative-Technology/dp/0131209655"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Industrial-Strength-Recommendations-In...</a><p>Today we have the same story happening again. On one hand we have legacy OO languages like Java and C++, and on the other hand we have pure functional languages like Scheme and Haskell. So along come &quot;hybrid functional&quot; languages like Scala which basically make the same promise as C++: if your problem has lots of objects then you can carry on doing the same OO designs you know and love, but if you think that these magic first-class functions would be useful in some complicated algorithms then you can use those as well. And its going to fail for the same reasons that C++ failed: the OO and functional features don&#x27;t interact well, so we are going to have lots of messy rules about them that cause subtle bugs, along with attempts by OO programmers to use chains of map and filter functions that work inefficiently because the compiler can&#x27;t optimise them. And in ten years time there will be an &quot;Industrial Strength Scala&quot; book consisting of a long list of features that should be avoided if you want reliable software.",1398598022

In the initialisation phase I put the points in each square that are closest to any search point in that square (some points were in multiple squares). Therefore, when a search was run, the square the search point falls in is looked up, and the list of twenty or so points was looked through for the closest point in a slightly optimised way (no square roots here).",1398597320
7654679,comment,7654392,7654392,119,0,kator,,,"First to be clear CRUD makes the world go around! I always find it interesting when people in our industry somehow look down at work that makes users happy and gets us all paid so we can do other things. :-)<p>I&#x27;ve been in tech for more then 30 years.  In that time I&#x27;ve done so many things it&#x27;s hard to pick just a couple interesting ones.  I think some of the fun ones are really old but even a couple are very recent:<p>* In the good old days HD&#x27;s would die and people would bring them to me hoping I could revive them.  I&#x27;ve swapped logic cards with working HD&#x27;s to recover data.  One disk was soaked from a fire sprinkler system in a small business&#x27; office.  I took it apart and rinsed it with distilled water, cleaned up a bunch of parts by hand, swapped logic boards and applied lubricants to various parts and was able to spin it up just long enough to back up the customer&#x27;s data.  Don&#x27;t try this at home with modern drives, get a recovery team to help you if the customer can afford the cost.<p>* In 1988 I was approached by a military contractor with a GPS board they built that needed to have a device driver built for SCO Unix.  They wanted 50ns realtime responses and I had to keep explaining to them that SCO Unix was not an RT OS but they were cornered into the OS by contract and had no choice.  So I pushed on them &quot;why this strict timing&quot; and after many signed documents and stuff I don&#x27;t really want to know I showed them we could build a device driver interface that allowed them to achieve their needed result. After many tests it turned out we were able to beat their timing requirements.  The contractor was very happy, I went as far as to make it a SCO Install disk etc, and they were able to make the install part of their build process.  The strange part was two years later I got a call from the contractor, they were in a panic because the driver didn&#x27;t work with the latest version of SCO and they had to &quot;urgently deploy a lot of these things&quot; into a undisclosed &quot;middle eastern territory&quot;.  I told the guy I was really busy (I was) even after that the next day he showed up at my house (literally my house) with a machine in his car and a blank check and begged me, he said his job and a lot of others were on the line and they didn&#x27;t have time for someone else to come up to speed and make the adjustments.  I caved in, I updated the drivers over night, it wasn&#x27;t too bad just some changes in the kernel interfaces and SCO had made some dumb changes to the way installs worked etc.  I gave him the results the next day late in the evening and he thanked me and drove off into the sunset.  I was never told exactly what they were used for... I&#x27;ve always wondered.. And no I didn&#x27;t burn them I charged my regular rate, but I did work about 18 hours on it in a 24 hour period.<p>* In recent years I&#x27;ve taken to building low-latency high scale systems.  One such system must respond to upwards of 1.6 million queries per second across six data centers and the response must be received by the requestor within 10ms.  The reality is with jitter even on local networks you really have about 7ms to respond.  I wrote this system in Python, Java, C, C++ and Nginx/LutJIT.  Each time I re-implemented the same solution but new tech with twists to leverage the strength of the underlying tech (Long living objects in Java to avoid GC, Cython, etc.) and my best implementation ended up being nginx/LuaJIT.  I was able to get about 15k qps/core using this configuration and it was rock stable, running for weeks without need of a reboot.  The best part is I&#x27;ve been able to publish the system internally with all the system settings (lots of network tweaks) and a script so others can deploy it and do their own testing.  Previously everything was C with Libevent and it&#x27;s just painful trying to get a large pool of people up to speed on using that to do their projects.  Most recently I&#x27;ve re-written this system in Go and am working through some crazy performance issues there.  I can&#x27;t seem to get Go&#x27;s scheduler to react as quickly as Nginx and often times it seems to latch on to just four CPU&#x27;s even though GOMAXPROCS is set to 8 or more.<p>I could go on for pages about all the other things I&#x27;ve done but, the underlying thing about them all is problem solving at a level of detail where most people give up.  I often say I&#x27;m not very smart; I&#x27;m just really persistent. I&#x27;m willing to change just one thing, retest, tweak another, retest and onward until the problem starts to present itself.  I often find people give up too soon, they think something is impossible or they&#x27;re scared of how much time it will take to find the solution.  For me if I see forward progress and I have the intuition that what I&#x27;m doing will work I keep pushing until I can disprove my intuition or prove it.  I think the sign of a good technologist is less about how super smart they are and more about how they approach solving real world problems.  I find it annoying when someone tries to get me to do some puzzle for an interview or other thought experiments that have little basis in reality.  That said, if someone asks me to solve a real world problem in an interview I&#x27;ll jump up to the whiteboard and tear it to up with great passion.<p>Don&#x27;t belittle yourself because you&#x27;re doing CRUD to pay the bills.  Instead challenge yourself to do more when someone isn&#x27;t paying the bill.  All my life I&#x27;ve worked and played in with technology and most people can not tell when I&#x27;m working or playing.  I am always pushing to learn new things.  As the example above shows, the system I built is working fine why do Go?  Why not?  In 30 more years all the languages will change, all the tech will be different but the problems will be related to today&#x27;s problems and the more you learn to stretch your mind and solve problems with many different approaches the more valuable you will be in the complex future that is coming at us every single day.",1398597251

Devs didn&#x27;t know how to find expressions that were at risk so they could cast them to a type for which the libraries worked reliably.<p>I discovered a useful combination of compiler flags and wrote an awk script to take the compiler output and make a list of source files and lines that produced calls to the broken lib function.

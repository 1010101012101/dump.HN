They are both walled gardens.<p>While at one point AOL was powerful and rich enough to purchase Time Warner.  AOL still hangs on, a shell of what it once was.  The main difference, is that AOL had a clear monetization strategy:  it charged its users for access.  And, it made craploads of money because it simplified computers and getting online for millions of people.<p>Facebook does a similar thing.  It allows people to do interesting things with their computers without having to worry about the dark and scary bits of the internet.<p>Us older people remember the devastation that occured when AOL unlocked the gate it's walled garden to let people access the internet at large.  It's know as the eternal September.  Finally, when AOL's users got tech savvy enough to use the wild internet without AOL's hand holding, they left in droves.<p>I suspect similar things are going to happen to Facebook users.  I could be wrong.",1245750289

It always seems fine from a distance, but when you're actually sitting in the waiting room or lying on your bed in the corridor, waiting to be put to sleep, it's truly a terrifying experience. ""Someone will put me to sleep now and there's a small chance I may not wake up"" is what usually goes through my head. It gives me the shivers to think about it even now.<p>And then you wake up and feel immensely drowsy and this pain thing keeps nagging at the edge of your consciousness (but that's ok, you can get an extra morphine shot and make it go away).<p>On the whole, I think the conclusion has to be: don't get yourself in situations which will require you to be operated (both of my surgeries were caused by things I had done).",1245749780

It stipulates, that you underestimate the power/usefulness of a new product 3 times and overestimate the  old product 3 times as well. This means a new product has to be ten times better to be successful.<p>As you mentioned, underlying to this whole thing is, that most people are change averse and therefore resisting it. Only around five percent of people truly like change (early adopters). All the others have to be forced to use something new.",1245749479

Also, this set my Small Sample Size Alarm off some:<p>> Bing is off to a remarkably good start. Microsoft has historically had 8% to 9% of the US search market compared to Yahoo!’s 20% and Google’s 65%. Early results show Bing’s share surging as high as 13% of 14% in the <i>three weeks after its introduction</i>. [emphasis added]<p>Still, interesting read. I actually feel better about Yahoo after reading it - I didn't realize they had that much cash in the bank. That means that barring an epic screwup, they've got at least 5-10 years to develop a new big revenue source. I wouldn't count them out yet, but they do need to develop some new products that make cash.",1245748655

670039,comment,668356,669527,0,0,voidpointer,,,"Well, since there is the need for this work to be done, it makes sense that someone gets trained to do that work. I remain skeptical though whether a university is the right provider for such a kind of education.<p>I'm from Germany and we do not really have an equivalent to US college education. Secondary education is partially integrated in our equivalent to a high school and you go to university after that. Alternatively, there is another path of secondary education/apprenticeship where you split your time between working for a company to get hands-on experience in your chosen line of work and attend classes the rest of the time. Such apprenticeships are also available for IT and software development related work.<p>Nevertheless, a lot of people believe that programming a computer is a sufficiently complex activity which only people that have attended university are capable of. That may be a part of the problem that the guy in the original article was complaining about: although people can acquire the skills needed to be a programmer elsewhere, they still go to universities in order to secure some credentials that will increase their chances of employment.",1245748311

670037,comment,668157,669415,0,0,Yrlec,,,"I think you are mixing runtime scalability with the actual complexity. Big-O definition from Wikipedia: Let f(x) and g(x) be two functions defined on some subset of the real numbers. One writes
f(x) = O(g(x)) as x -> infinity
if and only if, for sufficiently large values of x, f(x) is at most a constant times g(x) in absolute value. That is, f(x) = O(g(x)) if and only if there exists a positive real number M and a real number x0 such that
|f(x)| <= M|g(x)| for all x > x0.<p>In the above case M = 32, f = mergesort and g(x) = x because no matter of large input you have mergesort will always take less than or equal to 32n operations (since log(n)<=32) .",1245748249

Shouldn&#x27;t the exclusive control over a limited resource<p>Capital makes money by unpaid labor.<p>A woodshop is inherited by an heir.  The carpenter comes in and creates furniture - let us say tables.  The material for the table - wood, screws, varnish etc. cost $80.  This would also include other costs - if a saw blade costs $100 but is good for 100 tables, then that 1/100 of a sawblade ($1) is included in the $80.<p>The table sells for $100 in a store attached to the woodshop.  So all totalled inputs are $80, and the labor from the carpenter produces $20 of wealth per table.<p>The carpenter produces two tables an hour, and works for eight hours a day.  So the carpenter creates $320 worth of value a day.  The carpenter keeps all the wealth he creates for the first six hours a day - his daily take home pay is $240.<p>However, the carpenter is not paid for his labor for the last two hours a day.  He is working for free, with all wealth generated going to the heir.  This is surplus value he is generating, which is expropriated by the heir.  This is where the profit comes from.<p>All modern rentier wealth is generated through these means.  In the case of farmland, it is similar to the woodshop and carpenters, except we have workers, mostly of Mexican descent, working unpaid at the end of the day picking fruit in the Central Valley for those who took control of the land after Commodore John Sloat sailed his warships into Monterey Bay in the 1840s.<p>If the farmowner rents houses to the braceros, it is the same process, just one but removed.  The landlord is not working for rent, the person doing the work to create the wealth is still the renter, it is just one level of abstraction.  Usury is similar - moneylenders don&#x27;t work for the wealth - they collect interest from those who do.  Ultimately the value of all commodities derive from the work needed to create it.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort to collect and commoditize rainwater, so water is cheap.  To find and mine gold takes more effort, so it is more expensive.<p>The social relationship of expropriation of unpaid time is what is important.  It is all social relationships.  There are no signs pointing down from the heavens saying who owns what.  If it did, the farmland taken in California at gunpoint would belong to the Indians and Mexicans who lived there, not the heirs of that thest 175 years ago.  With the profits derived from the labor of fruit-pickers, the theft continues to this day.  As it does in the air-conditioned offices of Kifer Road and Market Street.",1436129289

Greece had a spending deficit for several decades now. This spending deficit accumulated to such a big dept, that no investors were willing to lend greece any more money.
18 european countries transferred billions of euros in the last couple of years to greece, to help the country and the people. In return they had an agreement that greece would cut their spending. Greece never lived up to the agreements it made.
In the last weeks 18 european countries offered greece another bailout, where greece would receive several bilions again. In return they asked greece to finally cut spendings.<p>Now greece voted against this bailout. There are a lot of people in europe (myself included, I am from Germany by the way) who are not willing to transfer further billions of euroes to greece, just so that a socialist party can fullfil its &quot;promises&quot; and increase their deficit.",1436129183

Heck, all they&#x27;ve been loaned so far is basically donations so that Europe could say to Eurozone members, &quot;well don&#x27;t anyone say we didn&#x27;t try&quot;.<p>What Greece needs is a mix of debt forgiveness, market reform (labor market and otherwise) to unfreeze a sclerotic economy which is more about bribing the bureaucracy than actual competitiveness, and a measure of austerity (starting with a later retirement age, and going from there). They were starting to go down that road! They made real progress with economic growth during the recovery! But the reforms were unpopular and might be impossible to do with their internal politics, leading us to the current crisis.<p>So instead they&#x27;re going to do the alternate version of hard-and-mean austerity by replacing euros with worthless drachmas and making everyone poorer (hope you don&#x27;t owe money in Euros). Then they&#x27;ll either rot for a while in stagnation before gradually getting their act together after all, or they&#x27;ll turn to Vladimir Putin for bailouts from the great petro-state as long as they last (with all the relevant geopolitical consequences and &quot;screw you Europe&quot; strings attached).",1436129165

Every half an hour or so his memory resets, and so 20 or 30 years later he still thinks that he&#x27;s an 18 year-old man who just got wounded in the war. There&#x27;s a particularly poignant moment in the story where his brother comes to visit the man in hospital in the 1970s, and how Jimmy is puzzled why his brother looks so old.<p>Another well-known case of retrograde amnesia is Clive Wearing, a British pianist who was the subject of a BBC documentary, &quot;Man Without a Memory&quot; [2].

Doing something unlawful to coerce someone into giving you something of value is extortion. Don&#x27;t extort people.<p>* Be extremely careful testing other people&#x27;s sites. The short answer to &quot;is it lawful to test someone&#x27;s site&quot; is, &quot;probably not&quot;. If they&#x27;ve posted a bug bounty or a list of thank-yous to researchers, you can reasonably infer that they&#x27;re allowing remote testing --- but if your testing crashes their site or compromises user data, all bets are off.<p>* Do not under any circumstances post actual user information, sanitized or otherwise.<p>* Do not post exploit code, or information that makes exploitation trivial. If the world doesn&#x27;t believe you about the severity of your finding, get better at gauging severity, or become a better writer.<p>If it were me, I&#x27;d probably sketch out a policy as follows:<p>* A calendar and set of escalations for confirmation of a finding --- first contact in order to find a safe way to relay the finding, escalating to public (Twitter) requests for someone to relay the finding to (maybe 2-3 business days later), escalating to simply sending the finding to public support addresses (maybe a week later). With no acknowledgement of a finding after, like, a month, I might escalate to posting the name of the company and a SHA2 hash of the finding, repeatedly confirming the finding every other week or so, and then maybe a month later more details on what the finding enables (the &quot;Phone numbers. Names. Location.&quot; thing you wrote here, I would not write for a long time.)<p>* Once the finding is confirmed, a simple schedule for public announcement. Maybe 30-90 days, depending, on generating a patch, and then N days after than for an announcement on my blog or whatever. If we&#x27;re doing a coordinated announcement where you send a bulletin that credits me and agrees with my assessment of the finding, maybe I&#x27;ll give you an extra 30 days after the patch if you want it. If I&#x27;m the only one who announces, maybe I&#x27;m announcing 5 days after the patch. Things like that.<p>The important things are:<p>1. Write a policy and stick to it.<p>2. Get the vulnerability confirmed before you announce it.<p>3. Negotiate with the vendor to minimize harm.<p>Again: be especially careful when you&#x27;re testing someone&#x27;s servers.

The other nations benefit significantly:<p>1) They gain political and economic stability for the institutions involved (the EU, the Euro, etc.) and for Europe in general.<p>2) They avoid an economic and political meltdown in a European country. Such situations spawn other problems (crime, refugees, political extremism, etc.) and those problems tend to spread across borders.<p>3) They gain a more prosperous and stable trading partner, which helps everyone.<p>4) They gain the precedent that when they are in trouble, for whatever reason, other nations will help them. Germany might recall the forgiveness of their massive crimes (and war debts) by their neighbors, enabling them to become the largest economy in Europe today. (EDIT: And all the creditor nations are depending on another country to defend them in case of war.)<p>5) They avoid Greece forming stronger bonds with other powers, such as Russia and China.<p>6) There also is the simple moral gain, that the impoverished in Greece won&#x27;t be driven to further misery.<p>The perspective that all that matters is money, and that it&#x27;s every nation for itself is unrealistic.",1436128822

We have had good results with it, and nearly all the people that we have disclosed vulnerabilities to have found it to be more than fair, and motivating. The researchers have found that it also gets results quickly.<p>By default it requires you to disclose that you are following this policy, disclose the vulnerability, as directed in the document, then give them 5 days to respond.  If you have done everything you could to contact them, and they will not respond, then disclose.<p>However, as others here have been saying, it may take a while to fix this problem. If they <i>do</i> respond, they may want to &quot;negotiate&quot; more than 5 days to fix the issue. That&#x27;s great. Get some details, set up a reasonable timeline with them, and get a contact&#x27;s information. Then it&#x27;s up to you to hold them accountable. Sometimes this means disclosing on the agreed upon deadline, other times it means following up and seeing if more time should be given before disclosing.<p>The main issue, as you point out, is keeping users/data safe. If the company is unwilling to work with you, not disclosing could put other people at risk, because you didn&#x27;t stop unsuspecting users from signing up for the service. On the other hand, disclosing without working with the company can unnecessarily put the current users/data at risk.<p>It&#x27;s good to have a balance.

I keep hearing this threat from people who really ought to know better. Inequality is a major talking point from the left, but it reflects complete ignorance of how the world works.<p>The French Revolution is memorable precisely because it&#x27;s so incredibly unusual. Look at Mexico, India, China... almost anywhere in the world aside from Europe and North America. There is virtually no society on the planet that doesn&#x27;t concentrate wealth and power among the elite one percent, gated off from the lower classes. I&#x27;m not even speaking historically -- show me a modern country on any other continent that even remotely approaches a middle class.<p>Also, re-distributing wealth doesn&#x27;t necessarily solve the cultural problems that create inequality. Egypt massively subsidized food... and Egyptians promptly had massive numbers of children that overwhelmed even the ridiculously cheap food prices. Just this week, Afghanis threw acid in the faces of schoolgirls trying to get an education. The Saudis cling to power through massive welfare programs to pacify their increasingly fundamentalist populace. Even here in the US, cultures that discourage education and responsibility aren&#x27;t suddenly going to churn out engineers and doctors if billionaires give away their wealth.<p>The US will just continue down the well-trodden path that the rest of the world has already blazed, where tiny pockets of wealthy elites try to shelter themselves from the increasingly lawless masses. A revolution requires organization and discipline, which is absurd to expect even before you consider the unbeatable modern surveillance of all communications and movements in developed countries. The only threat that masses pose is lawless violence, much like what we saw in the Arab Spring -- but that&#x27;s not really a problem when you can concentrate the rabble outside of elite pockets. Particularly when the rabble lack a unifying religious fervor, like what you see in the coalescing identity of fundamentalist Islam across MENA and Europe.<p>So please stop making vague threats about the French Revolution, people. The Second Amendment is not going to help rednecks water the tree of liberty. The people are not going to surge against their capitalist oppressors as a tide of justice or whatever. At worst, less developed countries will turn into Libya... but the more likely result is India, where elites gate off the masses and let them cultivate self-destructive cultures.",1436128104

9834774,comment,9834209,9834614,0,0,cperciva,,,"Greece is like an orphaned child who really likes eating candy.<p>Back in the 1990s, Greece was eating lots of candy, but it wanted to be adopted into a big and wealthy family, and the parents of that family had a rule that they would not adopt children who ate too much candy.  Greece kept on eating lots of candy, but it made faces and pretended that some of the candy was actually vegetables; and because some of the other kids in the family had grown fond of Greece, the parents overlooked the continued candy-eating and officially adopted Greece in 2001.<p>Now, it&#x27;s sometimes difficult for orphaned children to get their hands on candy, but if you&#x27;re part of a big and wealthy family, it becomes a lot easier.  Just like most children would, Greece started eating a lot more candy.  Greece&#x27;s adopted parents also had rules about how much candy their kids could eat (not just rules for children they were considering adopting) but Greece wasn&#x27;t the only child who was eating too much candy so they pretty much forgot about those rules for the moment.<p>Then 2008 hit.  Some children on the other side of the world started getting sick from eating too much candy, and immediately people started looking around at other children who were eating lots of candy and worrying about them.  Greece, which was by this point very much overweight, came to the top of everybody&#x27;s lists of children who had eaten too much candy.  Suddenly nobody was willing to give Greece any more candy, and this made Greece very unhappy.<p>So Greece turned to its adoptive parents and begged them to give it some more candy.  While they had ignored Greece&#x27;s growing waistline earlier, they had also gotten worried about it recently; so they offered Greece a deal: They would give Greece more candy -- not a lot, but enough that Greece could still feel slightly good about itself -- if Greece promised to go outside and get lots of exercise.<p>This worked for a while, and by 2014 Greece was starting to lose weight; but it wasn&#x27;t very happy with the situation -- Greece wanted to be playing Candy Crush, not running around outside.  In January 2015 Greece finally rebelled and told its parents that it was sick of running around outside and wanted a new deal which would allow it to keep eating candy <i>and</i> to be allowed to keep playing Candy Crush.<p>Greece&#x27;s parents were not very impressed by this, and promptly told Greece that this was not acceptable, and Greece was not going to get any more candy if Greece didn&#x27;t start doing as it was told.  Today, Greece thought about this, answered back with a resounding NO, and slammed the door as it ran away from home.<p>So what happens now?  Well, Greece isn&#x27;t going to be getting any more candy, for one thing.  Greece is going to be hungry, but the only way it will be able to eat at all is if it goes out and works hard to get it -- which means it won&#x27;t have much time to play Candy Crush either.  Greece might change its mind and go back to its parents, but at this point they&#x27;re pretty tired of Greece&#x27;s rebelliousness and they&#x27;re not likely to start handing out candy unless they see Greece start running laps first.<p>All in all, Greece is in for a few unhappy years.",1436127859

A glacier accumulates mass, principally from snowfall in winter, which compacts into ice and flows downhill. It losses mass through what&#x27;s called ablation - for a typical mountain glacier this is principally surface melt in summer, or for a glacier in polar regions it may be ice calving into the sea.<p>For obvious reasons, the accumulation zone for a mountain glacier will be at higher altitudes, and the ablation zone will be at lower altitudes. The equilibrium line altitude is the altitude at which mass lost equals mass gained.<p>As Mount St. Helens&#x27; glaciers disappeared following the eruption, the glacier(s) will start to regrow as snowfall causes ice accumulation above the equilibrium line altitude. Eventually, as the articles hints, the glacier will come back* into mass balance.<p>I&#x27;ve simplified this all somewhat, as there can be lots of other factors that influence mass balance (as the article mentions, rock cover will reduce surface melting).<p>*I say come back, as because of the natural variations in climate from year to year, mass balance is never steady-state.",1436126987

If Greece defaulted back then, investors would have lost their bounds and countries like Spain would have had big problems to sell their bounds.<p>It is much harder to consolidate your finances if you have to pay higher interests than already solid countries.<p>Before the Euro countries had a mechanism to tackle this: They could just print more of their own money. Italy was an example for that. They just weakened the Lira while Germany did not weaken its Deutsche Mark, so it was easier for Italy to export and harder to import goods.<p>The US entities that default do not have this problem, because there is always the state and federal governments that can step in after the default and help finance them. The Euro group did not had any entity that could help before the crisis. Now there are two mechanism ESM [0] and EFSM [1], but these two are essentially just fonds + some rules and can help only to a certain extent. They are too small to save a country like Italy or Spain if it defaults totally, let alone several of them. There is no entity above like the US federal government except the ECB itself, which does not have the mandate to do stuff like that (even if they do it anyway [2]).<p>Another reason is of course that state bonds are considered safe, so French and German insurance companies and the like invested in them, which would have needed to be bailed out later on anyway.<p>I think if Spain, Ireland etc. would not have saved their banks back then, it would have been safer to let Greece default.

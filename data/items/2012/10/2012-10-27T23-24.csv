Neither of them discuss Microsoft's general strategy hardly at all (Marco slips a few paragraphs in at the end, but it's not exactly the focus of the piece), and they <i>sure</i> don't talk about deeper trends regarding anything cultural whatsoever.<p>You're being extremely gracious by describing Marco as having ""touched on...Microsoft's retail strategy"" -- what he actually did is insert about ten jokey comments showcasing what he perceives as their incompetence.  It was pretty funny, but if you re-read it, I don't think you'll honestly claim that you learned something credible or useful about Microsoft based on his description.<p>If you want to write a blog post connecting Surface to other components of Microsoft's strategy, and you have some interesting things to say about that strategy or about culture or about whatever, that sounds potentially cool.

4707608,comment,4706892,4707462,4,0,jtheory,,,"A few suggestions based on my experience (I have the same problem sometimes...):<p>- ""get it working and keep it working"": get the minimal possible functionality working (outputting some result, even if there's utterly no error handling, input is ignored, all of the requisite services are stubs and any actual processing is faked), and make sure you keep it working -- if some refactoring is going to take more than an hour or two, plan it differently.  This helps you get really quickly to a proof-of-concept (with TODOs everywhere in the code), and stops you from shredding it to ""do it right"" because that would break it.<p>- keep a list of your ideas of how to do it correctly, in a separate file.  Yes, for the moment we're dropping the input directly into a SQL query and returning the result directly wrapped in a <pre> tag; for the real product we'll need parametrized queries, a dynamically loading JS table (to research), etc. etc.<p>- stay offline.  Do not download libraries or frameworks, do not research the best way to do X, do not research the problem domain or look for open source projects that do similar things but are huge and will suck up your entire afternoon when you could have just hacked out a completely unreuseable, inflexible, one-time fix for this particular problem in an hour.  Research is fun, it's interesting, and it's a way to avoid actually doing what you need to do -- half-assed work.  If you <i>really</i> need to look something up, put it on a list, and give yourself 10 minutes to research everything on the list in a few hours.<p>Good luck!",1351381473

4707600,comment,4707475,4707566,10,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Well I for one vote for Surface reviews and similar articles. And I think there is a lot to talk about with Surface, both on the product in itself and on the product as a signifier. Surface is a major product release, and iconic of a big shift in corporate strategy by one of the largest tech companies in the game. Surface is Microsoft's first step as an Apple-esque high-end device manufacturer. It speaks to the evolution of Microsoft specifically and to the continued development of post-iPhone UI and consumer tech in general. So there is a lot of interest riding on how Microsoft has executed the Surface, how well Windows 8 lives up to its promise, and the problems, potentials and future development of the platform. And Marco's review touched on all those points, as well as the issue of Microsoft's retail strategy and the Microsoft-Apple rivalry. Then consider that all of these issues plug into even deeper trends of the growing relationship between IT, everyday life and popular culture, including Apple's successful fashion-isation of technology (always a hot button for the traditionally specs and functionality oriented IT enthusiast crowd.)<p>So it's not surprising I think that people are interested and emotional about these issues. It would be surprising if they weren't. But just because they are appear populist does not mean they aren't rich potential sites of inquiry - it just becomes harder to explore why they are interesting when the debate so easily spins out of control.",1351381259

You become a part of a tribe and naturally begin to see the world in an us vs. them paradigm.<p>It's worth noting that this is an irrational behaviour set, and best avoided if you want to learn anything objective. In typically-emotive arguments like these, you have to make the decision yourself and realise that, whatever you choose, you'll likely justify it to yourself afterwards however you can.

But I am in my early 40's and I find the iPhone display too small. I also do a lot of napkin sketching, so the stylus feature is a plus for me - not a negative.<p>But then I am old enough that I learned how to use the original palm. Had a color Handspring for a while with a folding keyboard that I used for notes in business meeting. The more things change, the more things stay the same.<p>I also loved the promise of Siri but find the execution wothless at least 50% or the time. The android dictation seems to work better. Last but not least, I hated the old version of iPhone maps and he new version seems to be worse.<p>YMMV",1351379016

It's beneficial to both parties to trade.<p>There is an American show called Dirty Jobs. In an episode sometime in the last couple of years, the host visits a medical waste recycling plant. It's a family business, and the owner describes how he got started.<p>Years back, there were no state laws governing the disposal of medical waste. The owner had been working as a forensic cleaner (cleaning up bodies after murders and such). His mother was a nurse. Around that time, the state passed new laws regulating med waste disposal. His mother, who knew about this because of her job, made an offhand comment that her son should start a business disposing of the waste. So he ran with it.<p>Over the years, the owner and his sons have built a thriving business based on the disposal of medical waste. It's a dirty, hard job, but apparently profitable.<p>Don't forget, there's lots of ways to build a business if there are market opportunities.",1351379012

The S3 is actually a great phone and I find it hard to believe people don't know the iPhone and accept something they don't like. At the least they consider both and go with the S3 because they like it and partially because they can't buy the iPhone anyways. Remember Microsoft / Nokia paying more commission to sales people hasn't taken WP anywhere.<p>Tangentially is Apple losing their acclaimed  grip on the supply chain if they can't make enough iPhones but Samsung can make and sell double that after paying sales people more and still making 7.4B in profit?",1351379005

Most people find sex a pretty pleasant topic, even if occasionally juvenile.<p>We filter out hateful or racist things.  (I.e. those aren't happy things.) We also filter out the random letters, though I like to leave in the JavaScript injection attempts.<p>Jon writes on behalf of himself for techcrunch.  As I'm sure you realize, we aren't interested in ""locking things down"".<p>We are always looking for good people, as is everyone else. The level of skills and capabilities out there is much lower than the demand, and given how much money is involved it is pretty surprising that we aren't, as a society, as the globalized interconnected species we are, training more people to develop the skills. Especially when the tools are so in reach and you don't need formalized training or get licensed or whatever.<p>We hire between 2-4 people a month, whenever we find a good fit. We are especially looking for team leads and technical project managers, but if you are good then we find a way to make it work.  Engineers who can communicate and lead are the limiting resource.<p>And if you don't think that ""jiggly breasts"" qualifies as a ""happy thought"" on a corporate homepage then it's probably not a good match...",1351378808

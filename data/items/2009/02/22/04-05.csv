It is hell to write a new parser for convoluted standards.<p>2. permissive parsers have to waste more CPU cycles trying to fix everything (admittedly this is not as big of a problem in the current day and age)<p>3. Weak standards leads to badly coded pages. Badly coded pages generally have bad design. Badly designed pages don't help anyone.<p>4. It drives the people who care crazy (Ok, maybe that's not a real reason :))<p>5. I'm sure there are others I can't think of.",1235278590

Every OS that I know of offers scalable fonts, and a higher resolution allows for nice smooth fonts without hacks like anti-aliasing and cleartype.  My 13.1"" laptop has a resolution of 1600x900, my 4"" Nokia 770 has a resolution of 800x480, and my cell phone's 3"" display is 480x320.  I don't think anybody's complaining about not being able to see their phones or tablets, and I certainly have no trouble using my laptop.<p>In what way does a higher resolution hurt anything?",1235277740

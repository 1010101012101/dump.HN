So if you really believe in your idea launch it and see if the market accepts it.  If not tweak the parameters till it does. Build a minimum viable product and try to fail cheaply.  If it works, investors will come running to you. A good way to look at it is that your startup is like an experiment and your product/service is the hypothesis you are testing.

I would summarize your first two points as ""there is tremendous demand for this concept"".<p>Your first point is that this basic concept has been so successful that governments have felt the need to regulate it to combat its adverse effects, which is a risk Airbnb is pretty well aware of. In fact, all of the adverse effects you list are true of hotels as well, except for ""shorting cities on their hotel taxes"".  If municipalities eventually decide to force Airbnb to charge hotel taxes, that would diminish their appeal but probably not destroy the business. Hugely successful companies like Amazon are facing similar problems.<p>Your second point is essentially that the idea of providing an online marketplace to remove inefficiencies of brokerages is not a new one, and therefore Airbnb should not be ""overly"" congratulated. But we're not congratulating Airbnb for the novelty of the idea, but for building a business which is apparently worth <i>a billion dollars</i>.  Many hugely successful startups have ideas which might be obvious.<p>As for your third point, there might be something legitimate there. I don't know anything about VRBO vs. AirBNB in terms of traction and customer satisfaction, but it appears from one of your other replies that your only evidence is anecdotal. My personal anecdotal evidence is that everyone I know has been very happy with using AirBNB.",1306789975

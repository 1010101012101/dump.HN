326915,comment,326532,326532,0,0,mkn,,,"I think that the point about risking the incomprehension of those around you points to something deeper. I always marvel at Goddard's courage, for example, when he was launching liquid rockets out of a cabbage patch. Here's a guy who <i>moved back in with his mom</i> and  faced the ridicule of local and national newspapermen who fundamentally misunderstood the physics of what he was doing.<p>The incomprehension of the tribe nearly always leads to the most crushing kind of social defeat. And when you factor in the inevitable failures of any novel challenge, I'll bet you'll find that the life of an intellectual hero isn't just lonely, it's leadenly depressing. (I'm thinking right now of a comment made by one of the Wright brothers on the train home after a failed flight attempt: ""Man will not fly for a thousand years."") It's no fun to be a depressed hero, I'm sure. For every Goddard and Wright brother, there must be thousands of failure stories, each of them detailing a life you'd never want to live.<p>The cost associated with real innovation is generally very high. We are, after all, paleolithic creatures living in a technical world. Conformity means a successful hunt. We're monkeys with mp3 players. Thus, this innovator's penalty is an atavism, but it's not one we're going to overcome anytime soon.",1223492066

The government gives then $2000 for free.<p>You come to the bank and ask for $1500. They give it to you. Over the next 4 years you work for an employer, giving him about $4000 of value.

Yes, there's an art to it, but that's not a technical challenge in the programming domain. The outside veneer is important, but it's not interesting to work on from a technical viewpoint. And furthermore, it's best left to UI experts to design -- any sane GUI designer makes it easy enough for 90% of the UI to be done by drag and drop. (Yep. No sane GUI designers that I've seen yet exist for web apps,partly because there's no standard GUI toolkit.)<p>It's not like mechanical engineers spend the majority of their time deciding on the trim and positioning of internals which compose the interface to the car. Instead they collaborate with the designers the constraints on the interior layout, and then they leave the interface details to the designers, while working on the drivetrain, suspension, frame, and so on.<p>The point I'm making isn't that GUIs are unimportant. The point is that GUIs are uninteresting if you are looking for a technically challenging problem to solve with code. This lack of challenge can be compounded today with the trend towards designers providing specs to programmers, and then leaving the programmers to implement it, as the creative element is reduced.",1223489886

However, it's a strictly weaker tool in terms of structure and semantics than a proper VCS. Also, not only does using a raw filesystem put the burden on <i>you</i> to remember the associations between branches and versions, it also gives you zero support for merging once those branches are made.<p>Git is pretty good about following renames, moves, and other changes to the underlying filesystem, while still maintaining a proper graph structure to relate revisions to each other. Fast network replication and mirroring is just another benefit, as is the ability to quickly merge changes from multiple branches.<p>Finally, as another commenter has already suggested, it's really just about establishing good habits as part of your workflow early. It's much like testing: if you start out with a decent test suite, you're much more likely to maintain and use it than you are if you have to overlay testing onto an established project.

It will take a while to get it off, but it's a freakin powerhorse we're talking about here. It's not South Africa, it's the biggest economy in the world.<p>All these things you speak about are momentary things. They react to short term events.<p>The problems right now are due to the gambling nature of many American businesses - but it's that same nature that makes American #1 in so many ways.<p>This is just a correction. It's not a recession. America has been living above it's means and will drop down a notch or two, but the fundamentals are very strong.<p>Education - good
Science & Research - good
Investment & Risk Taking - good
Intellectual Capital - good
Natural resources - good<p>America is fine, people are just using this bubble cycle as propaganda for an election, and you guys are panicking. Take it easy - go scoop up some stocks at rock bottom prices like the richest man in the world is doing.",1223489305

One of my elementary school teachers made this rule in class to write out numbers from [one to ten] and then use numbers to represent everything greater than ten [11, 12, ...].  Helped remove a lot of confusion then as to when is it OK to use numbers vs. writing-them-out!",1223489030

Most hackers have a personality that tends to be strongly focused at the task at hand, often at the expense of paying attention to others things around them.  This means that while they might be technically capable of functioning as an office assistant, it will be a very poor use of their skill set and others are likely to be able to do a better job with it, as they enjoy using the skill set required for the job.  If the sole responsibility of the role is a tour guide, or PR individual, then there is a good chance that they are the hacker is the wrong individual for the job.  On the same note, if there is a lot of repetitive work that requires an intense focus and can't be automated, quite often the hacker personalities may lose interest.<p>Just because one is qualified to do the job does not mean that you'll be meeting the companies unspecified needs.  If you aren't agreeing to work for X amount of time, the company may lose out solely because the costs of hiring and replacing you are greater then the benefits you'll provide.<p>In summary, there are occasions where HR is required and does it well. Just because most companies err too far in one direction does not mean that there aren't legitimate reasons hiding in the original guidelines that will need to be addressed.  For a specific instance, I have friend who is looking to go into coding from QA.  We had a QA opening at my current employer, but the desire to leave QA means after X amount of time means that my friend was not the right candidate for that job.",1223488968

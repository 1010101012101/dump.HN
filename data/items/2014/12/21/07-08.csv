In many cases, they will already have revenue, sometimes meaningful revenue.<p>If you want to get into YC, I would advise taking whatever steps are presently possible to create the business, and then demonstrating that you&#x27;re making forward progress when you apply.

These people are actually copy pasting all the way down to HTML and CSS. All the design work and nitty gritty of how user interaction should look like is already done for them. They already know how it was bootstrapped, why it is successful and what users would expect from it. In other words they bypass most of the risky unknowns that causes large number of startup to fall. Backend is sure not replicable but given that they operate on smaller scales, most applications such as AirBnB would boil down to creating simple database and shuttling data back and forth which becomes college-level project that can be done quickly and thrown in market. I would not expect them to clone startups that is heavy on CS skills such as those requiring machine learning or computer vision or large amount of computing power. They would mostly go for startups where formulation of user experience is key and implementation is basically a relational database with UI doing simple read/writes.",1419147748

Moons are an excellent spot for life, in some ways maybe even better than planets. They are more numerous, they can be cozy even outside of the Goldilocks zone, to some degree they can be protected by the magnetic field of their gas giant, they are never tidally locked to the star, and they might have a better chance for volatile chemicals on the surface than your average rocky planet.<p>Since the thread was originally about the Fermi paradox though, one has to wonder about the likelihood for bearing technological civilizations.

In the same vein people would say that a girl had a short skirt, so likely a slut and totally deserved the treatment she got.<p>What you&#x27;re doing is rationalizing the crime. People do that because they can&#x27;t stand the alternative - admission than those in power can and do railroad people&#x27;s lives because they feel like it, and there is nothing you can do to stop it. The mere thought of it is unbearable, so it&#x27;s easier to come up with an excuse as to why the victim had it coming, and therefore why this won&#x27;t happen to me and people I care about. It&#x27;s called &quot;the just world fallacy&quot; - a mistaken belief that everything happens for a reason, and so nothing needs to be done about it. It&#x27;s where the fear of doing something meets the excuse for not having to do it.<p>But here&#x27;s some good news - you can actually admit that those things are unjust, and you are not obligated to right the wrongs by yourself.

But the market wasn&#x27;t buying them because nobody knew their true value. Everyone lost faith in the ratings agencies so it was chaos.<p>Small banks benefited from this as well. It stabilized the market for mortgage securities, which small banks had large exposure to. It solved the liquidity crunch so the banks could stay open.<p>If the big banks fail, it would take the small ones with them. It would also take a lot of good businesses with it.

Imagine you just started working on updating a house last month. The owner comes to you with a request that they be able to see what&#x27;s going on in the kitchen from the living room; you _could_ just knock a hole in the wall. That would satisfy the basic requirements, but it&#x27;s going to make a mess, it&#x27;s going to look like shit, and it may disrupt the electricity/plumbing/hvac or even the stability of the house itself. But even if we make a proper window or door between the rooms without disrupting other systems in the house and clean up our mess, it&#x27;s still possible we make a door or window that is a little different than all of the other doors and windows the past builders have put in the house.<p>In 2 or 10 or 20 years, after several maintainers have come and gone, the owner discovers that they&#x27;re being bled dry by the house&#x27;s energy inefficiency. The new maintainer may go measure a window twice and get the dimensions down precisely and then count all of the windows in the house that look the same. Then they go place an order for N new energy-efficient windows. When the windows arrive and they&#x27;re getting ready to replace them, they come to the terrifying realization that every window in the house is actually custom, and only a few of the windows will fit. They install the windows that fit and try to return the others only to find out the vendor charges a healthy restocking fee. Down 40% of our budget for replacing the windows but only having actually replaced 15% of them, we no longer have enough money to replace the rest. The owner decides to just use the remaining 60% to cover the increased energy costs instead of fixing the issues.<p>The new maintainer goes to put the diagonal blinds back up on the windows that did get replaced and discovers the custom mounting hardware has gone missing in the shuffle, so the blinds get left in the corner with a note that someone needs to find a way to put them back up when there is time and money. It&#x27;s the middle of the winter anyways; the sun is always under the horizon when the owners are home. Because this is a _funhouse_, these were of course the blinds with the greatest role in reflecting summer heat, and despite the improved window technology, total energy efficiency is going to be in the shitter come summertime. For now, perhaps quixotically, energy efficiency is buoyed by the extra solar heat; the owner seems happy enough with the updates, and the metrics all show good performance.<p>Houses need maintenance. Things on or in them break and can&#x27;t be fixed because either the parts aren&#x27;t made that way anymore or the knowledge of how to fix it has eroded. They end up with empty telephone nooks and doors that were sheet-rocked over instead of being removed. A major appliance stops working and you discover the house needs infrastructure updates before a contemporary version of the same can be installed. The maintainers want to add a floor and some new rooms and they need an architect and an engineer to make sure they aren&#x27;t going to ruin the roof line, slab or overload a wall. Down the road it will have different rooms built in the fashion of three decades over a span of 80 years. Further down the road a room will get sealed off when the roof caves in and the owner doesn&#x27;t have the funds to fix it.",1419145792

There are so few in whatever is new, and all it takes is 1 year of effort to become an expert in that field.<p>Having the expertise remain valuable is more about luck and intuition, but I don&#x27;t really care one way or the other if what I spend my time on remains valuable. The valuable part is being able to learn something, and developing the skill to learn tasks. If you repeat this with a different thing for every year of your life, you will become an expert at becoming an expert, a skill that far exceeds knowing any one domain.<p>I don&#x27;t, and have never desired what you seem to desire, learning an expertise that lasts generations. Which means, learning a domain that lasts for generations.<p>The very act of being an expert at becoming an expert makes you impossibly valuable to any corporation that exists.

The electron and the photon are entangled. Continue this line of thinking and you arrive at the famous Schrodinger&#x27;s cat... it&#x27;s a cascading entanglement of larger and larger groups of particles until you open the box and the waveform of every particle in the whole cat collapses to either alive or dead.<p>The waveform is not really a physical object; I think of it as a probability distribution about the state of the system when observed. These probabilities can be highly correlated; in this case, the probability of observing the electron at one energy level or another is 100% correlated to the probability of observing or not observing the photon at all - which is the definition of entanglement.<p>Yes, you are constantly observing collapsing wave functions. It might be some solace that most of said wave functions have highly-degenerate probability distributions. By this I mean that 99.999...% of the &quot;mass&quot; of the distribution lies in something reasonable happening. For example, each particle in a tennis ball is so highly entangled to every other particle, that when you throw it against a wall, it&#x27;s exceedingly likely that the ball will bounce back. A single unentangled atom may have been able to pass right through the wall, but the tennis ball&#x27;s &quot;waveform&quot; is much more stable and localized such that it&#x27;s better approximated by classical mechanics.",1442264245

It&#x27;s one of several things I&#x27;ve worked on, so I&#x27;d like to use this opportunity to toss out a question of sorts:<p>For one project, an influence has been the Bloomberg Terminal. The concept relates to aggregating large amounts of publicly accessible data, using a proprietary system of sorting and arranging, and then present the customer with a batch (folder?) of useful information relating to their business pursuits. It&#x27;s kind of like a business intelligence / lead generation platform, but that&#x27;s simplistic and misses the value of the concept.<p>Now, how this relates to hardware! As a musician I&#x27;m very familiar with the iLok USB-key concept used for certain software suites (some of which have gone cloud-based). This also gets back to the Bloomberg Terminal. Would pursuing a &quot;Subscription Service Requiring Desktop Box/Key&quot; type design be an initial Negative or Positive?<p>I do feel like this isn&#x27;t exactly a hardware question, but with the amount of data and investment that would be involved to build the system in mind, having a physical, subscription component seems practical. I suppose that&#x27;s about the extent I can describe at this point without getting explicit about how it works, what it works with, and who the target audience is/will be.

It felt like something out of a movie.<p>-  Passages to the roof outside the normal fire escapes.<p>-  A bunch of underground tunnels (not steam tunnels) that ran under the school and connected to god knows where - all three tunnels ended at another set of locked double doors we couldn&#x27;t seem to open with our lockpick set at the time. We think it may have been some 1940&#x27;s bomb shelter or something.<p>-  The best was being in the maintenance rooms where they fixed stuff and had some really cool tools and tons of stuff in various stages of being torn apart. We also figured out the janitors had tools to break into the combination locks that secured all of our lockers which raised a few eyebrows.<p>-  All the outdoor storage areas. My school had four huge garages built into the side of a hill where all the sports equipment like track and field hurdles, landing mats, soccer goals and nets. They contained all kinds of balls and other things that probably shouldn&#x27;t be stored there like jersey&#x27;s, warm up suits, etc. It felt like stepping back into time since a lot of the stuff in there hadn&#x27;t see the light of day since the 1970&#x27;s.<p>-  Tons of empty storage rooms that were located throughout the school. This was the real reason we wanted to get those master keys. They just seemed completely random. Like in one hall, there were three, non-descript doors. No &quot;Maintenance Only&quot; or &quot;No Students Allowed&quot; posted on them. You&#x27;d almost miss them if you didn&#x27;t recognize them. Some were empty, other held trophies from the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s. Others had boxes and boxes of financial and academic records of students from long ago. Others had political flyers and pins from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s.<p>The one thing I was really proud of is that we didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious. We explored the school and never vandalized anything and for the most part were responsible with the power we had.

10217376,comment,10212629,10214429,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The reasons are somewhat complicated, though some are straightforward. There is a ton of money in software, and a ton of people who want to be devs. Which means that even if a company makes a lot of mistakes they can still be profitable. And even if they burn out or drive away a ton of talent there is still no end of bodies willing to try to do the work, they just may not have the same level of skills.<p>I think rigor is an important part of the &quot;solution&quot; but in a way that&#x27;s too easy. It&#x27;s simplistic to just say &quot;do better&quot;, which is sort of what a call for rigor is. Ultimately I think it&#x27;s not rigor but just seriousness which is called for. Right now the industry is downright delusional and avoiding even talking about some of the fundamentals of software engineering as a practice. So many people want to feel like they&#x27;re on the bleeding edge, rather than struggling through the mire (which is the reality). We have to get to the stage where people are talking about these things first before we get to the stage where we can do anything about them.<p>Right now the industry is in a rough shape. And the industry doesn&#x27;t realize this mostly because there&#x27;s so much money still (and money is a salve for many wounds) and because not long ago the industry was in crisis, so we&#x27;re still seeing improvement from that state. Merely producing anything of value from a software project is still a big deal, and not a sure thing. Moreover, shipping any major product or service without relying on &quot;crunch mode&quot; or a death march is a rarity in the industry these days.<p>But we can do better. Not just with rigor but with how people use their time and do work. The norm is still too close to everyone running around in firefighting mode all the time, while technical debt blooms and burnout looms. A better mode is to work at a slower pace, get the right work done at a higher quality level, and still maintain good development velocity because you aren&#x27;t slowed down by your technical debt all the time. There are some, small, pockets of the industry where that&#x27;s the norm, but it&#x27;s still a hard sell. At the end of the day the default is <i>still</i> to fall back to the ridiculous notion that software dev is like factory work and you get more bang for your buck by just adding more bodies and by having more butts in seats (or fingers at keyboards) for more hours per week.",1442263807

The article even mentions the sexual harassment in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, which only concerned interactions (and not even ones based on &#x27;sexual desire&#x27;) between men.<p>Plus, I disagree with your definition of a police state. The laws can be crystal clear about what&#x27;s considered a crime - eg, holding a meeting with more than 5 people without permission, publishing without first getting an authorization stamp from the censor, not having an internal passport to move around the country, spending the night in a place not designated for people of your skin color - and still be a police state.<p>The underlying difficulty is that &quot;police state&quot; is ambiguous. If you want a boss to be free to fire a employee who refuses to have sex with a potential customer, then a law banning that practice may be a sign of a police state. If you think a company should be free to reject veterans, Catholics, or Indians as employees, then certainly you might consider the existing civil rights laws to be examples of police state action.<p>For someone who thinks that anti-discrimination laws are part of a police state, then of course anyone who supports anti-discrimination laws supports a police state. But that weakens the meaning of &#x27;police state&#x27; to something rather tepid and useless. &quot;There should be a law preventing the setting off of fireworks during periods of extreme fire danger&quot; is a limit on freedom, yet hardly something that deserves being called a police state.<p>So again I ask, &quot;What does &quot;police state&quot; have to do with this article?&quot;",1442263491

1036586,comment,1036379,1036470,0,0,mbreese,,,"You're only hosed if you use the C library.  If you use a Free/Open source licensed language (Python,PHP,etc...), you're in the clear.  MySQL has a FOSS licensing exception (and always has).   So the clients for these languages aren't GPL-viral.<p>Now the C-library is a different story.  If you want to use it, then you're looking either GPL or one of their supported FOSS licenses.  So, it isn't quite as bad as you're making it sound.<p>What really needs to happen is to have someone write an LGPL or BSD MySQL client library.  That would pretty much put up a licensing firewall.  This might even be the case with something like DBSlayer.  It would be even more clear if the middleware supported multiple DB backends.<p>MySQL has always straddled this GPL/FOSS/proprietary fence, and never made it very clear if you really needed a commercial license.  I could be 'misremembering', but I thought that at one time they even explicitly said that if you used Python/Perl/PHP/etc you could write proprietary software w/o a commercial license.  However, they also said that if your program ""required MySQL features"" that you had to have a commercial license.  They made all of their money off of this confusion.  But I think that if a third-party BSD client library spoke the correct binary protocol to the server, that you'd be in the clear.  Then again, I'm not a lawyer...<p><a href=""http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/</a>",1262843917

1036582,comment,1036530,1036530,0,0,celticjames,,,"I worked with David on the Mozilla Education project. Here's my two cents.<p>It's easy to put out the call for volunteers. It's hard to cope with the deluge of people who want to help.<p>Code bases are complex and/or large in any meaningful project. Even skilled programmers may take time to get up to speed. Core developers have limited time available to answer questions. (People don't scale.)<p>For someone working outside of a classroom, this may be fine. They aren't on a schedule and can claw their way into a community over time.<p>But if you plan to unleash a classroom of students on an open source project, what you really need is an instructor who operates at or near the level of a core contributor to that project. The instructor is the one who bears the overhead of scaling up developer time by funneling student questions into a high signal to noise stream.<p>Mozilla is a bit unusual in that they actual pay someone (David) to do that.<p>I know instructors have attempted to replicate this model with other large open source projects, but it hasn't been a success. Attempts I know of to work with openoffice or the Eclipse Foundation didn't really go anywhere. RedHat/Fedora might be a good place to look. Try to get in touch with Greg De Koenigsberg there.",1262843802

Reserving the right to create non-GPL'd versions is a legitimate business model and way to finance copyleft software. It's just that since it was an allowable strategy for MySQL AB, it should be allowable for Oracle Corporation, too.<p>FWIW, a variant of the same business model was used by Sleepycat Software for the BerkeleyDB family of products -- which have continued to be supported and improved and sold since Oracle acquired them.",1262843708

1036579,comment,1036379,1036379,0,0,gojomo,,,"I'm concerned about having a leading (by usership) free SQL database under the control of the leading (by revenue) proprietary SQL database vendor.<p>And, I believe it would ultimately be better for MySQL users for it to be under a more permissive, non-copyleft license. It allows for a broader commercial ecosystem.<p>But, I'm uncomfortable with regulators telling companies what to do with their lawfully acquired property/rights based on speculation about potential abuses that haven't even occurred yet.<p>And, I'm uncomfortable with someone who chose for their own benefit one doctrinaire set of rules -- the GPL -- now asking for the rules to be rewritten, against the wishes of the people to whom he sold his package of rights.<p>So I can't support the campaign, even though I'd like one of its sought end states (non-copyleft MySQL).<p>Maybe if someone other then Widenius led a purely-antitrust-based case for divesting or relicensing MySQL.

If you practice  (guitar) for 20 -30 minutes <i>daily</i> for a year, you should be good enough to play some popular songs at parties and so on, ideally with people playing other instruments.<p>The key is to regularity (don't miss practice) and focus (be aware of what you are doing when you practice) and not so much short bursts of intense practice.<p>As mentioned above if you can get <i>good</i>  private lessons , go for it.

Python is an open source project and the developers get to choose what they will work on. If the Unladen Swallow guys want to merge into 3.x, that's their right.

> Change forward word is in a mainstream editor: [Shift]+[Ctrl]+[Right]<p>I stand corrected.<p>> Change line: Home, [Shift]+[End]<p>Here there is a translation at work: the editor lacks an atomic ""change line"" command, so users resort to ""move cursor to the beginning of line, then select text up to the end of the line"", which is something you could do in Vim, too, if you wanted.<p>> Moreover you forgot to mention that you always need to switch modes...<p>I don't understand. Do you mean you have to switch between Insert and Normal mode? If so, this is where newbies - including me some years ago - make their bigger mistake: you don't linger in Insert mode, you hit Esc as soon as you end entering text. Either you are typing text, or you are in Normal mode. This is the reason you need the Esc key as easily accessible as possible. On my keyboard, it is on the Caps Lock key. And : is unshifted.<p>> BTW: Has any vim fan ever used the refactoring feature in Eclipse? Or edited Code during runtime using the Graphical Debugger? I doubt it... ;-)<p>I'm with you on this. Still, people confuse Vi-style editing with either Vim or other Vi clones. Vi-style editing is neither Vi nor Vim nor Elvis nor [name an editor]. I used Eclipse and Visual Studio, yes, and guess what: I had Vi-style-editing plugins on both. What people call ""the best of both worlds"".<p>EDIT: Vi-style editing rocks at <i>editing text</i>, which is a subset - or not the same - of <i>editing code</i>. A user editing code with a mainstream editor offering powerful code-completion and refactoring facilities may have at her disposal a more powerful tool than a user editing code with a Vi-style editor lacking such facilities.",1342198509

This is why, at least in the US, we have 3 branches of government, so that each one will check the other out of self-interest and balance possible abuse/corruption (not perfect - but pretty darn good!).</i><p>I think you have the right intuition, but you don't go far enough. The root problem in finance is that people have turned over to government the power to control money. There is too much trust in government officials and in the banks that fund them.<p>Government's ability to control money has resulted in fiat money that is constantly being devalued, encouraging people to make risky investments and to take on debt. This has been very profitable for government, which has ready access to low-cost funding. Fiat money has also been very profitable for banks, which through the ""magic"" of fractional-reserve banking, have been able to loan with interest money they can simply create.<p>The solution is to take away the power to control money from government. Let people decide what they will use as money and they will choose money that maintains its value. They will also invest in institutions that do not use fractional-reserves and other risky schemes and thus are not subject to bank-runs.<p>A US politician that is talking about real reform is Ron Paul. The bill that would allow currency competition is The Free Competition in Currency Act. It's about one page long. <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1098/text"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1098/text</a><p>Give people the freedom to choose their money, let them choose to invest it in the institutions of their choice, and problems like the Libor scandal will stop being so important. The people who committed fraud will be prosecuted. Damages will be paid. Reputations will be damaged. People will choose to bank elsewhere. No problem.<p>By trusting government to control money, fraud in the few institutions favored with a bank charter becomes a very important issue. It doesn't have to be.",1342198084

He's not the rocket scientist that's inventing a revolutionary technology before he brushes his teeth in the morning. It's true that he's got the opportunity to stand on other people's shoulders, both technically and logistically (e.g., the use of NASA's tracking stations).<p>But I think that in your caution, you're taking away too much credit. The reason that SpaceX has been so successful is because they <i>are able to</i> take those ideas that were already out there, and bring them to fruition. NASA has not been able to do so, whether that's because of politics, bureacracy, inertia of decades of tradition, or a culture that's too risk-averse.<p>And that's the whole point: NASA hasn't been able to do these things, despite government funding (i.e., no investors to report to), and over the decades, every bit as many starry-eyed fanboys as follow Musk. NASA has boatloads of brilliant people, but SpaceX has (or seems to have) what's needed to turn the brilliant technical ideas into something real.<p>IMHO, this isn't something absolutely unique to Musk; it's more a liability in NASA's balance sheet. Their dependence on governmental funding, and thus the whims and nepotism of politics, prevent real success.

First, my Mt.Gox is mostly inactive, so I actually had to reset my password and setup a new one that I had never used before. Then, after I sold my coins, I realized I cannot transfer my money to my Dwolla account; MtGox needs a scanned copy of my SSN! While I was deliberating whether I should trust MtGox with my SSN, 24 hours had passed, and I got an automated email from MtGox saying my money had been converted to bitcoins and has been transferred! Everything gone! So, the fact that :
1. My account was mostly inactive.
2. I had recently changed my account password to a new more complex one : 2 upper caps, 5 lower case, 2 numbers and one special character.
3. My money was sitting in my account for only 24 hours.
4. The time between my money getting converted to bitcoins and the actual transfer was just a few seconds, as if an automated script scans all accounts and the performs some tasks on them.

People on HN think of software patents as patenting an e-mail notification indicator, where independent invention is likely to be very common. My experience has been things like complex signal processing algorithms where the probability of independent invention (within the patent period) is very low.<p>Besides the probability of independent invention, the other key difference between the two cases is that in the former, you could never sell someone the idea of e-mail notifications in the absence of patent protection. In the latter case, the idea itself is very valuable--the patent just provides a legal structure that facilitates transactions.<p>As for the ""standing on shoulders"" angle, I think it's all about the difference between applied research and fundamental research. There isn't any money in giving away the fruits of your labor for the good of humanity (which is why top students from Harvard, MIT, etc, head to investment banks rather than fundamental research labs). And even amongst the altruisticly-minded, some fields are much more engendering of generous feelings than others.

From the ones I did, it was far more focussed on math and abstract problem solving. I guess that will help you understand how to do basic things: looping/recursion, and conditionals, but to me problems that involve things like user interfaces, visualization, IO or the way you structure your code are far more interesting.<p>Project Euler reminds me of when I did computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for a while. From a programming standpoint, a lot of CFD is fairly simple--the place where CFD methods really differentiate themselves is in their modeling of the underlying physics. From that standpoint, I wouldn't really advocate doing CFD as a way of learning to program, because being a great programmer isn't really the thing that will make you great at doing CFDbeing great at math and modeling is.

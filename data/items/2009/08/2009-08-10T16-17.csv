Attorney finds a class and a cause and moves forward on suit<p>3. AT&T objects, possibly countersues<p>4. Attorney now has small-to-medium sized fight over non-enforceability of the clause<p>5. Class action suit goes ahead as planned<p>It's steps three and four which are new, and require more lawyering by the class action attorney - who will no-doubt do it, since they wouldn't have started the class action to being with if they hadn't thought they'd win.<p>As for how this compares to mandatory arbitration clauses, the theory behind them is that people can get similar levels of justice through that process as they can through the courts, with less cost and general overhead required. Preventing class action suits, however, takes away a form of legal remedy - the class action - and doesn't replace it with something similar. There's no legal theory like this behind this clause; it's pretty blatantly about taking away a form of legal recourse without replacing it.<p>I am pretty sure a clause like this has never been tried before the courts, but if it was, my money would be on it being thrown out rather quickly.",1249922728

753308,comment,752948,753008,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Another thought:<p>Why doesn't Java make it easier to refer to a method and call it dynamically?<p>For this example:<p><pre><code>    List<Person> beerDrinkers = new ArrayList<Person>();
    for (Person p: persons) {
        if (p.getAge() > 16) {
	        beerDrinkers.add(p);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
If we had a legalAge method defined on Person returning true for any person over 16, then it would be nice to write the equivalent of<p><pre><code>    List<Person> beerDrinkers = filter(persons, legalAge);
</code></pre>
which would call the legalAge method on each person and keep the ones returning true.  Like most things with Java, you can do this, kind of, but it means getting the instance class, looking up the method for the method name and signature, then invoking on the instance, all of which makes it just not worth it.  Objective C has the idea of selectors, which is an easy way to specify the message you want to send to an object, which probably comes from some similar concept in SmallTalk.<p>This is arguably a more object oriented solution to this general problem.  For one, it better follows Demeter's Law, as you do not need to expose the getAge property.",1249921360

753291,comment,752864,752864,0,0,mdasen,,,"Here are my thoughts for what they're worth.<p>If you hire contractors, it becomes really difficult.  Do you know who to hire?  You can't just say ""I will pay X for you to make Y"" and then assume you're good to go for several reasons.  First, there are many flaky contractors out there.  Since you don't know that much about programming, you wouldn't be able to determine who is a good programmer and who isn't.  Likewise, with programs the devil's in the details.  That means that, if you aren't paying much, you might get what your spec is, but won't get the details that make it something worth while.<p>In terms of what to pay them, it's a hard question.  Sometimes quality and price run in tandem, but as I've mentioned, if you aren't so much a programmer, you aren't going to be a good filter there.  You kinda have to pay by the hour which is crappy because it means that you don't know what the bill will be, but the other way means that you either pay way more than it's worth or you try to skimp and end up getting a developer that quits a month and a half later leaving you just where you started.<p>And, well, good programmers have better options than being used as cogs.  If you were to hire me, I'd want to be a partner in the venture.  And I don't mean in terms of the money even.  I'd want to be an equal socially - that we respected each other's opinion, liked bouncing ideas off each other, enjoyed being in the same space working, and meshed like that.  That contrasts to many arrangements where someone sees themselves as the ""vision"" person who is so uber-important and then there's some programmer who's a glorified translator who doesn't have the intelligence and vision to be like you.  You don't sound like that type and that's wonderful. And project management and prioritization and all that detail work takes a lot of time and you can do that.<p>--<p>That brings me to another point.  Ideas are cheap.  Everyone has ideas.  Few can execute.  When I used to freelance, I'd get people coming to me with ideas all the time.  None were that original (I remember one person pitching an idea of ""MySpace, but for bands"" seeming not to realize that MySpace is already for bands).  Facebook didn't become big because they had an idea for a social network.  Many had tried before.  Facebook became big because their implementation (from the layout of the pages, to the features added, to the annoyances removed, to the architecture that was fast and didn't fail often) worked well.  Heck, Gmail is so loved simply because of implementation.  Email was a very well defined and well adopted system.  Google just made it fast, a joy to use and reliable.<p>And you can help out somewhat with the implementation in terms of layout, design, and features, but ultimately you need someone really smart at implementing solutions if you want something good.<p>--<p>Right now, I'd go with #1.  Keep learning at least enough that you can filter programmer abilities. Until you can tell a good programmer from someone who talks a good game, you should learn.  It's easy for someone to say that they know OO PHP, but most people who say something like that can't tell me what a reference is.  It won't eat up too much time and you might find that your learning curve hockey sticks and you don't need outside help.<p>If you do need outside help, you'll be better equipped to get good outside help rather than being stranded with someone crappy.  YC (and other similar programs) are good, but work best when you have a partner.  If you're going to take on a partner, make sure they're who you want to be working with and don't be too proud to put them on an equal footing.  You don't want someone who is an inferior programmer and the good programmers want a nice happy relationship, not something that feels like a business deal that they're on the short end of.  And really, when businesses succeed and people like each other in the business, money is plentiful enough that you'll be happy you enjoy the people you're working with rather than dreading dealing with them.<p>Good things usually don't come out of negativity.  If you want to create something great, you have to treat people like they're great.  Then you get the best people, they do the best work, and everyone is happy.  I'm not saying you have to give someone more than their due, just that if you decide you're going to hire a programmer for $10/hr you'll get what you pay for - they'll resist the work, make crap, and be of low ability.<p>Good Luck!",1249921072

753280,comment,752878,752878,0,0,jacquesm,,,"There are many ways to interpret those lyrics, here is mine:<p>#1 -> don't brag. common sense<p>#2 -> never let them know your next move, is not exactly about innovation, it's about being unpredictable so it's harder to hit you. For crack dealers this makes sense. Innovation in the drugs scene would be to come out with a new way to get high (which crack actually was...).<p>#3 -> never trust nobody: Paranoia is the hallmark of the true junkie, as well as of the dealers scene. It serves no place in business, you <i>have</i> to learn how to trust people. Key employees, business partners and so on. This is coming from somebody that has been burnt once. I'd rather get burned again than to live my life in fear of what my partners could be doing to screw me over. And patents are totally against my principles, time to market is what it is all about and the internet has made that easier than ever before. You actually <i>can</i> make a killing on an idea+good execution these days. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't investigate if there is a fire when you see smoke. Paranoia spoils the atmosphere like nothing else will though, so use with caution.<p>#4 never get high on your own supply: crack dealers parlance to make sure you understand the difference between the stuff you've got for trade and for personal use. If you can't make that difference you'll use up your trade stash and you'll be out of business. For regular business people this is bs, if you would not use your own product you're basically telling people that it is not good enough for you. The chairman of a major car brand had better drive his own product, not a competitors or the press would have a field day with it.<p>#5 don't sell to friends and family: I've got mixed feelings about that one. It's true that you might not get the best feedback possible that way, but look at it from another angle, if they won't use your product, how on earth are you going to sell to perfect strangers. And discounts for friends, family and employees are quite ok, especially if the product is virtual.<p>#6 no credit -> agreed 100%, but also the other way around, take no credit for the company unless you absolutely have to. Very few startups need (large) lines of credit. If you're working on something virtual there are only a few things that will actually cost money. It's probably better to save for a bit and then to execute than to load up your fledgeling startup with interest payments right from day #1.<p>#7 separate family and business -> It depends. Some people work great as a team, even though they are family, some people can't even go to a birthday party together even though they are family. Just as with strangers with family it is important to have your responsibilities and rights absolutely clear. It's a lack of clarity and confusion that will lead to trouble, not whether someone is family or not.<p>#8 no weight -> this relates to not carrying stuff so that when you get stopped for a check you don't happen to have a load of stuff on you, so use dead drops and so on. Good advice in the drugs world. This is good advice, so keep your passwords where you can get at them but nobody else can, preferably in your head.<p>#9 I don't understand the slang, so no comment<p>#10 is about accepting drugs that you can not pay for, in other words consignment sales. Bad move for a crack pusher. For a business it's a way to finance real world stuff that they are sure they can move, it's a lot cheaper than going to the bank which is why it's done all over the world. But mostly in the physical goods trade. Hard to 'consign' a bucket of bits. The equity or loan question is a tough one, each startup sooner or later has to face it and if and when the time comes you'll have to weigh the price of equity very carefully against a standard loan.<p>So, no offense to the late Notorious BIG, but the interpretations were a little stretched.<p>If anybody should get any weird ideas about me because of the above, I grew up in a city with a very lively drugs scene, but I never even smoked a cigarette.",1249920810

There are old functional programming languages and there are young functional programming languages.  The fact is that most of the interesting research into programming languages these days goes ends up in functional languages such as Haskell or an ML-variant.<p>And I really don't buy your ""bloat"" claim.  Surely mutating member variables unnecessarily is ""bloat"".  And having redundant getters and setters seems pretty bloated to me.  In fact, forcing everything in the universe into a paradigm that largely consists of straight-line imperative code boxed up in classes seems like the ultimate example of bloat, given that one could simply code in an imperative style without using objects.<p>If anything, I would think that the measures suggested would result in marginally <i>smaller</i> code-size, which I assume is the metric you are employing to measure ""bloat"".  In performance terms, I would imagine that these suggestions would result in no performance impact, or some small improvement as it is quite likely that the optimiser will be able to do a better job if you apply this style uniformly.  As you say, it might be a <i>minimal</i> gain, but don't we as programmers have something of a responsibility to write the best programs we can and use our tools to the fullest of our abilities, especially when the cost is zero or almost-zero?<p>So what metric are you using here?  I assume it's something a bit fuzzy like ""readability"" or ""ease of maintenance""?  In that case, you're basically saying ""things that are different to what I already do are harder to do"", which in addition to being mildly silly, is a total cop-out and is intellectual dishonesty.  Too many good ideas in programming languages have been sunk by programmers who hate the idea of not being the expert all of the time, with such behaviour being hidden behind very weak justifications that sound technical, but are actually just about egos.<p>Naturally, this might not be the case with you at all!  However, I'd be very interested to know on what objective basis you are making judgements about the awfulness and bloatedness of code (in any language) that employs a more ""functional"" style.",1249920349

Your password will display the same sequence each time, so you can learn to expect ""blue, red, pink"", for instance; if you instead see ""green, purple, yellow"", you'll know you typed it wrong.

Other than your basic problems, such as malware, screen spying, and the like, whenever you use your password manager, all of your passwords will be decrypted in memory and displayed on the screen. This leaves your passwords exposes in two places. Cold boot attacks make it very easy to grab this from memory, especially on desktop machines where they might remain in memory for a good while. On the iPhone, screen leaking is of particular concern as the device has several things going on in the background transparent to the application. These include a keyboard logger which caches input into insecure fields and a screenshot utility which takes screen snaps to process animations and transitions, among other things. I've seen some password managers that input your passwords into normal, insecure fields where your password winds up in the keyboard cache in plain text. I've also seen plenty of passwords show up in screen shots taken by the iPhone unbeknownst to the user.<p>It's far better to adopt the good habit of committing passwords to memory, and reduces your risk of exposure greatly. And if your data is that important that you absolutely have to protect access to it, you should be using one-time passwords or RSA keys.",1249920027

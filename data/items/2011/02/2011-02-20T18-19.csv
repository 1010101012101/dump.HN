For example, what role are technical tools playing in the arabic revolutions right now? Obviously Wikileaks, reddit, youtube, twitter and facebook are playing major roles. And what role are hackers playing? Assange, Anonymous, and the Egyptian Google guy are all using technical skills to create worldwide revolution. That's pretty exciting, using technology to make political change. But should discussing it be banned? Is it necessary to ban that to get rid of the various latest cop shooting incidents reposted from reddit where technology is at most a minor role.",1298228336

Using Lisp, he had access to everything that would <i>eventually</i> become C# features and <i>then some</i>, because if you want a fancy new language feature in Lisp you just add it. You don't have to touch the compiler (you write functions, macros, or a micro-compiler at the limit).<p>So there's some hyperbole there, but it's true that C# 2.0 or 1.1 was really not anything special and felt a lot like ""Microsoft's Java"" at the time.",1298227379

If it were strictly about the education (courses, books, etc.) there would be no purpose -- most of it can be found for free online.<p>University is about the whole package, of which a strong alumni network is often a major piece.

Undoubtedly, as I progress further in my career, that fervor would have grown with team success, and also made my attachment more real - while my current alma mater (Chapman University in Southern California) - would have fallen away from consciousness with no legitimate way to grab my attention.
Whether I make a donation to any school in the future is up for debate, and I am now not likely to get an MBA based on many of the points raised here and elsewhere - but the point made on this comment hits the nail on the head.
I find it extremely unlikely that I will ever donate to my small private school in Southern California - because the thoughts of how it's helped me depart with every passing second, and they have no way to get it back.</i><p>This obviously leads to a weakening of the school on a whole, in terms of future enrollment and overall reputation, leading to a decline in the quality of education.",1298227367

Print journalists compete directly with the 6am/12pm/5pm/10pm news on radio and TV in that they're providing exactly the same material.<p>An author isn't competing directly with Radio, TV or Cinema, in fact the three are generally seen as complimentary markets. I've barely seen a good/great movie in the past decade that hasn't come from a book. From these films made from books, they explode the sales of the books.<p>Movies and TV is never going to replace literature, the cost->outcome ratio is far too big for movies than it is for books. I'm a writer, I'm currently working on a novel and I only have to do a couple of hours a night to be doing 1,000 words a day. Supposing I'm hitting only 250 words an hour (about 1/2 of what I usually do and I'm by far from the ideal writing situation that I used to have when I was working as a reviewer; this would easily factor in editing and other work for sale) it would take about 320 hours to write a novel length book would cost me as an author about 3300 dollars (as I'm unlikely to get paid any more than ontario minimum wage if I get a second job), which would more likely be 2500 after taxes.<p>That's 2500 dollars for a book you could publish. Worst case, self-pub an eBook on Lulu at $0.99 with their 50% royalty rate and you'll only have to sell to 5,000 people to break even. If you actually sold the book, you're likely to see between $2,500 to $5,000 for a first-time advance at a genre imprint, which means break-even or profit from the get go.<p>Break even for a movie is in the millions of dollars. Survivability for most TV shows is in the millions of viewers.<p>There's such naivety, yes traditional publishing sales have diminished and hasn't been immediately translated into eBook sales of the same figures (no shit sherlock the books cost a lot less, meaning there'll actually be market for more books for the same dollar value). In the 1940's 60% of the US population went to the cinema <i>weekly</i>. Since the late 1960's it has been steady at 10%. IIRC Nielson reported a 6% decline in TV viewership between 18-34's during the 2010 summer months.<p>Markets change, which is a fact of the free economy. The written word isn't going to die off because the paperback declines. Video isn't going to die off just because we stop going to the cinema or watching TV.<p>Just look at webcomics and the dozens of artists who are self-sufficient because of it.

I asked about one in particular as an example, the flag.<p>I know flagging from youtube, it is used much for erotic and violent content which after being reviewed manually by employees of youtube (which undoubtedly has significant labor costs) has a warning label assigned and age sign-in or click through added. Perhaps it means the same thing here. If so it's not clear what sorts of posts it would be used on since I have not seen violent or erotic posts here, or even spam. So that is why I asked how does it work and please give some examples of actual posts is should be used on. Also discuss how introducing new punishment features will not have unintended consequences. A discussion of these sorts of things should precede any vote on what actions to take, that's how they do it in various congresses and parliaments.<p>(Regarding the other topic, I don't know if there is a S/N problem or not. There are different kinds of posts than there were a year ago. There are more people here and different people. This is not what my comment was addressing at all though. I assume as a starting point that there is a problem with wrong posts and here are some proposals to solve it. I don't know if that is the case but I am assuming it to move on and discuss proposed changes to the board. The question I had was how will these solve the problem. The mechanisms of how these would work to improve things is no doubt clear to the OP, but is not obvious to me. Then again, since we are being asked to rank them, perhaps it is not so obvious even to the OP. If it is very obvious and clear to all we would just be told these should be implemented, and not asked which ones we have a gut feeling might work.)",1298226936

And you're right that, in one (extremely narrow) sense, this grants recipients of BSD-licensed code more ""freedom"" than recipients of GPL-licensed code.<p>The free software movement is about granting users freedom in this narrow sense, but it is <i>also</i> about building a society in which software freedom is valued and protected in a much broader sense.  Software freedom is a social, moral and cultural goal in the same way that freedom of the press, freedom of association, or freedom from malicious prosecution are.  These are ""freedoms"" in a broader sense than the dictionary definition, perhaps, but that doesn't mean that ""freedom"" is the wrong word to use.<p>Indeed, the broad sense of ""freedom"" is the one that is of primary importance, because without the social institutions that implement the broad sense of ""freedom,"" the narrow sense of individual freedom in a particular setting becomes irrelevant or, worse, non-existent.  Unless we have freedom of the press in the broad sense, for example, the fact that any <i>particular</i> publisher is free to say what it wants remains hollow.  (One could hardly say, for example, that a country which has a single publisher that's free to publish as it pleases -- the state-run media outlet -- has a ""free press."")  A whole series of institutions are required to have a free press: a legal system that protects free printed speech, a system of publishers that actually produce that printed speech, an economic system that supports those publishers, and so on.  In the same way, a whole series of institutions are required for software freedom: a system that protects certain freedoms of use for all users, as well as a system for developing free software, and for supporting that development in one way or another.  It is these institutions that the GPL helps create; and in their absence, the possibility of BSD-licensed code, whether or not it would be ""more free"" in a particular case, is irrelevant to the social goal of software freedom for everyone.<p>Unfortunately, it is precisely the broad sense of ""freedom"" as a network of social institutions that define, protect and promote individual freedoms (in the narrow sense) that introduces the trade-offs and hard choices, the balancing act between certain particular freedoms of certain individuals and other freedoms of other individuals.  But again, this hardly means that freedoms in the broad sense are not properly so called.

Example: a small group with relatively low karma could simply upvote every post and comment made by others within that group (a complete directed graph of upvoting). It would not take a particularly large group to be able to artificially inflate its karma at a greater than linear rate.<p>The quick (and probably flawed) solution I came up with was to have a tiered base amount that is determined by the karma percentile of the upvoter (eg, 75th percentile might get you an additional 2 points, 25-75 1 extra). Furthermore, there is an additional potential bonus based on the karma delta between voter and votee (ie, upvotes from top HN'ers are more valuable to newbs than to other top HN'ers). As an example, we'll say that we add one point for every 25% tier between the voter and votee (no bonus if they are the same). Using this example, a top-tier vote would be worth 5 points to a newb but 3 to a veteran.<p>This would allow high-quality posters with more recent accounts to quickly gain the necessary karma for voting, polls, etc without causing such massive karma inflation on the high end.",1298225733

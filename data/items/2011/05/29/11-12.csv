I worked at a company where we discussed doing this with carriers for their corporate customers, where obviously you have all the historical data and tariffs. On the technical side every bit of activity was an event, so we could easily replay it through a theoretical tariff, and we wanted to use genetic algorithms to come up with new, better tariffs (which were pretty complicated as they involved various different international voice and data rates). You might think it was in carriers' interests not to do this as they make tons of profit on their customers overspending, but apparently not.<p>We never ended up doing this, however, and most of their tariff discussions continued being back-of-cigarette-packet calculations.<p>The idea and technology would actually be applicable to all sorts of domains - utility bills, for example.",1306670308

I think it's a stronger movie than the original with a better villain, a bit of Shakespearean mistaken identity, new characters that you care about, and foreshadowing for the final movie (Stinky Pete asks ""Is Andy going to take you to college?"" and claims they'll all end up in a landfill.) The climatic scene at the Airport is almost as good as the ""Bird Rescue"" scene in ""A Bug's Life"" (which I contend is one of the best action scenes in any animated movie).<p>In fact, the only thing I don't like about it is how easy Woody gives up on Andy. Woody is, in my opinion, Andy's surrogate father and probably should have come up with ""Come with me to Andy's House"" much sooner.<p>(With all this obsession about Pixar movies, can anyone tell I have a three-year old?)",1306669185

I have enough technical skills/experience to get iphone, android, java, and google app engine apps done -- but I am afraid of taking the plunge from comfort of salary.<p>My wife and I are planning for a child next year and I am not sure the current lifestyle is suitable for a family life -- work from morning till late night and through weekends.<p>Help! Some critical advise will be nice now.<p>Feel like shit. :-(\n(this is a throwaway account)",1306666972

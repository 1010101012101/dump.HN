Their market share is as big as it is because of the fact that Baidu is essentially the Chinese Pirate Bay.<p>Feats somewhat more difficult to reproduce when competing on a level playing field where promoting, aiding and abetting piracy is somewhat frowned upon.<p>Who would want to compete with the deck stacked against you like that? Sure, China's market may be big enough to mask such deficiencies, blinded as everyone is by that 1 billion+ number, but its a net loss, long term, losing access to a quality competitor.",1269338210

1212566,comment,1211904,1211904,0,0,petewailes,,,"What people paid for was for the businesses to pay for their own costs and make enough of a profit to keep going. What people got in return was content.<p>However, why they paid was because their was no good, free alternative. When people are offered a product that very closely replicates their current experience, but at a largely reduced price point, they switch.<p>Case in point 1 - the good replacement: digital downloading of music. People are willing to download from iTunes because the cost is less than that of a CD, and they don't listen to music on CD players anymore. As such, it reduces cost to them, both in terms of financial cost and in terms of time expenditure (don't have to go to the store, and don't have to rip it to their computer).<p>The problem here is that you need something that people are still willing to pay for. Which means something they think they'll use more than once. That's why people still buy books and periodicals. Because they're building librarys, not reading something for one-time consumption.<p>Case in point 2: Linux. Linux does not yet closely enough replicate the experience of Windows for people to be able to switch. ""Where's the exe file for me to click to install something?"" ""Why isn't their a download button on Apple for iTunes on Linux?"" ""What does compile from source mean?"" ""Why can't it install the driver automatically?""<p>The problem here is that it's very hard to make Windows again without getting your ass sued off, and it's even harder to do it for free. Also the myth that anyone anywhere can fix a problem found in the codebase is a myth. Most people can't (lack of knowhow), and there's no guarentee that their fix wouldn't break something for other users, or that it'd be safe and not introduce security issues.<p>Case in point 3: real estate. The housing market collapsed because people were given access to morgages they couldn't repay, by people who couldn't afford to take the hit if they didn't. Of course if you offer people more money, for the same or lower levels of repayment they're going to take it. In this case, it was perceived immediate value, against long term reward that brought the problem, but the underlying mental process is much the same.<p>The problem is, how do you differentiate yourself in a market, where you can only offer a sensible product that matches the needs of your consumer, when every competitor can match you exactly? That's where market research and common sense need to come in, to find better ways of meeting your consumers needs, and balancing what the consumer desires against what you can offer as a responsible business.<p>Takeaways:<p>* Consumers pay for the value they perceive their getting<p>* Businesses set the prices based on the maximum ROI they can get based on their marketing efficacy<p>* Everyone trys to find ways to cut costs whilst maintaining the ROI, to attract more customers or increase ROI whilst maintaining price points",1269337835

Within the feminist movement, the vitriolic anti-male segment has really shrunk since the 1970&#x27;s, and if anything there is a much bigger subset today that seek to validate and justify traditional gender roles.<p>In my personal experience, I&#x27;ve encountered a decent number of men who point to innate gender differences to justify the skewed representation of women in engineering. I have also encountered a decent number of feminists who embrace traditional gender roles. I have yet to encounter any feminist of the vitriolic anti-male persuasion, though I read about them in my American Legal History class. In the mainstream media, I&#x27;ve read a few articles along the lines of Susan Patton&#x27;s regressive letter urging Princeton women to &quot;find a husband&quot; while they had the opportunity to do so at an Ivy League institution, but none of the vitriolic anti-male screeds that people assure me exists.",1392148546

Worth a shot, but there are deadline pressures which often force your hand and there are likely physical constraints which would limit the amount of increase you can legitimately experience.

How quickly can other people absorb the genius thought flows you are expounding?  +4 seems like a fair upper bound, plus you get to feel better.<p>I think it depends to some degree though on the type of work you are doing, but the power degradation that occurs when pushing yourself is kind of akin to going insane, you probably won&#x27;t realize it is happening until you are staring at some javascript error haplessly and suddenly remember that you used to be able to summon the solution at will, or remember that you used to know that it was considered impolite to scream at random people on the street.",1392148395

No Bitcoin protocol exists outside of the single source of truth, which is &quot;how does the Satoshi client actually operate?&quot;<p>Both exchanges use the JSON/RPC interface to the Satoshi bitcoin client.  That is the One True Way to use Bitcoin to develop Bitcoin-consuming applications.  To do otherwise is madness.  (I&#x27;ve seen explanations that Mt. Gox was using a custom client, but I believe they mean &quot;Mt. Gox was using a custom system which took care of bookkeeping for itself, because the Satoshi client cannot operate thousand of wallets in any sane fashion, but used the Satoshi client for interacting with the Bitcoin network.&quot;)<p>The Bitcoin RPC interface exposes many methods.  I don&#x27;t have intimate knowledge of which one these exchanges were using, but since they all have similar issues, let&#x27;s assume they used sendtoaddress.<p>The message signature of sendtoaddress is (pseudo-code):<p><pre><code>   #returns transaction_id\n   sendtoaddress(from_account, to_bitcoin_address, amount, optional_message)  \n</code></pre>\nThe mistake which both exchanges made is they assumed transaction_id is the same transaction_id used for gettransaction(transaction_id).  It is.  If you send a transaction, wait an hour, and then get it by ID, that will work.<p>But it isn&#x27;t.  Transaction ID means absolutely nothing.  It can be changed by any party, worldwide, for up to one hour after the invocation of sendtoaddress.  If you use gettransaction(transaction_id) and it returns nil, that does not prove that the transaction you previously created did not succeed correctly.  You should not attempt to retry the transaction until first verifying that you have all the coins you started with and that the recipient does not have some of your coins.  You can conveniently do this with an O(n) scan over all Bitcoin transactions ever.  (Someone pointed out to me on twitter that it isn&#x27;t O(n) if you have your database indices set properly.  Well, yeah, true.)<p>You&#x27;ll need to know what addresses you actually sent from, which is obscured by the sentoaddress API described above, for that scan to succeed, so essentially you&#x27;re going to reimpliment much of the Satoshi Bitcoin client, particularly around the area of wallet management.  Don&#x27;t reimpliment everything, though -- down that path lies madness.  Also, try not to make any bugs anywhere, particularly not the kind which only show up when someone tries to steal from you.<p>Good luck!",1392148041

Could you explain this a bit more? Did you mean that keystores are less secure than a browser logged into Persona/email account? If so, TPMs/HSMs are also getting more and more widespread (although rarely supported and used in practice, which is regrettable) and can further improve situation with secure key storage.<p>Password sync can be made both usable and reasonably secure (proven both by both Mozilla and Chrome), why key sync can&#x27;t? One can sync a single key over multiple devices using some kind of key escrow, or trade a bit of convenience for security with the necessity for one-time initial device setup (signing device key with a master key).<p>I&#x27;m no security expert, but I think the most problematic part with certificate-based credentials is not syncing or storage but revocation of compromised credentials.

Heat correlates with increases in violence; that is not a reason to depopulate the equator and colonize the Antarctic.<p>In general, the reinforcement learning present in humans mean that neural systems that are activated more are more influential, easier to activate, etc.. Exposure to violent media unsurprisingly results in increased availability (basically, increased access speed) of violent cognitions and behaviors, and lowered emotional responses (which is not a good thing -- it is very good to be disgusted at violent images, this is indicative of a trait called empathy which can be very adaptive in even the modern world).<p>Humans are not designed, evolutionarily, to disbelieve things we see. In our evolutionary environment, everything we saw was real. Special effects did not exist. It is actually cognitively effortful to disbelieve -- making research participants complete distractor tasks while having them discriminate between information marked, explicitly, as true or false causes them to be less accurate at judging. When you see a video game character kill someone and experience reward, that is an observational learning experience that is associating positive valence with violent behaviors.<p>Within the scientific community there&#x27;s virtually no disagreement on this topic. Denying it is in the same class as denying climate change.<p>There is definitely a causal link between violent media consumption and violent behavior. Violent media consumption is neither necessary nor sufficient for violent behavior, but it is causal.<p>(This also does not imply that violent media causes large violent outbursts -- heightened availability of aggressive behavior could manifest as simply as being more easily frustrated or having a slightly quicker temper. But very small effects build up over time, sometimes into large amounts of lost value.)<p>I suppose your rhetorical question could be read as a value statement, in that it&#x27;s ethically subjective whether violent behaviors caused by violent media are &quot;bad&quot;.

But, as with all things, the devil is in the details. Assassination as a weapon of war can sometimes be worthwhile, even moral, but when it requires the spread of the &quot;battlefield&quot; to nearly the entire world and when it routinely takes the lives of bystanders needlessly then its validity and usefulness comes into sharp question. Even more so when it is exercised based on secret information.<p>We&#x27;ve been blowing up a lot of down-level al qaeda leaders and operatives (at least folks who have been alleged to be such) and in the process we&#x27;ve killed a substantial number of bystanders and innocents. Either through accidents or through collateral damage. As I mentioned, in practice the drone strikes have been about as effective and as precisely targeted as using car bombs would have been. If the US had been blowing up al qaeda leaders using car bombs I think the perception of the campaign would be markedly different.<p>The existing rules of warfare are there because war is chaotic and anarchic, and without a firewall between warfare and civilized society then it becomes all too easy for violence and warfare to be used as a political tool at home.

The two are inseparable. Without izs, any real development of npm would slow to a crawl, until someone else familiar with the codebase takes ownership.<p>I know izs personally and he is a stand up guy and a lot of the negative comments about him selling out in this thread are completely unjustified, especially without knowing more details about the rights he has relative to the contract he has with npm, inc. as its CEO.<p>If push comes to shove and izs disagrees with the direction the VCs push company after later rounds of funding where izs and the other founders lose control, does he still have the right to split off from the company and continue supporting npm the open source project independent of npm, inc., including taking it in a direction contrary to the goals of npm, inc.? If the answer is no, then there is risk that the community has plenty of time to mitigate if we really care about keeping npm as a public good. The risk is that we lose the most valuable person to this project because he can&#x27;t work on it anymore.<p>That being said, the license information on the npm github repo shows that the most valuable assets are owned by izs and not this new company. He owns the trademarks &quot;npm&quot;, &quot;the npm registry&quot; and the copyright on the npm codebase. npm, inc. does not own these things. I assume that he, the individual, licenses rights to the npm name to npm, inc. With all this in mind, does he have a non-compete clause that would prevent him from supporting npm if, for whatever reason, he splits off from npm, inc. If there are no legal restrictions on his rights to contribute/maintain, I&#x27;d say the risks are much lower than we thing.<p>At the end of the day, if people in the community really feel strongly about all this, the best thing they can does is start building equity around a different trademarks other than &quot;npm&quot; and the &quot;the npm registry&quot;. Those are the two most important assets and given that the codebase is licensed as Artistic License v2, the name of any fork in the future would have to change its name even if the trademarks were unprotectable.<p>If all this bothers you, do the work to build a community fork of npm with a different name (and give ownership of the trademarks to the community), maintain feature parity and compatibility with npm and maintain registry mirrors for this community version. Add to this community fork a dual publish feature that simultaneously publishes modules to npm, inc. controlled registry servers and community maintained ones. This is the best insurance policy the community can have.<p>Either put your time where your mouth is and start working on a community fork that lives peacefully in parallel or quit whining and especially quit criticizing izs. izs has contributed an incredible amount of time to the needs of the community and has more than earned the goodwill and benefit of the doubt. If npm, inc. one day starts doing something truly anti-community, that is the time to cry foul, not now.",1392145797

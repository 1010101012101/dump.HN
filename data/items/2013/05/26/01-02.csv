You have a long term maintenance relationship set up that typically doesn't require chunks of work at a time.<p>The overheads to doing a 10 minute fix are massive: they email/call you to make a request, you change work contexts, fix the issue, test and release it, notify them that you're done, keep track of the time you spent working, send an invoice at the end of the month, keep an eye out for payment, thank them for paying etc.<p>Rounding up to the hour mitigates this, but unless you're doing several maintenance requests per client per week, or are charging very high ($250+) hourly rates, your business is probably losing money by keeping this client on the books.<p>I think it's better to negotiate a monthly retainer that ensures making tiny updates is worth your while, and then just have a set-and-forget invoice that gets sent automatically every month for that amount.

To be honest, nearly all the people I know that are good at observational drawing are crackerjack designers.  And they are not limited to popular fads and patterns.  When you can see, and _know_ what you see, inspiration and information rains from the sky.  Everything you look at becomes a source of ideas.<p>And similarly, if you want to be good at color styling, learn to mix paint to match observation.  Oh, it doesn't have to be _actual_ paint. Mixing pixels in Photoshop will work, the point is to try and match colors by observation and manipulation, rather than simply ""eyedropping"" it.  Good photographers often pick up good color skills simply by doing a lot of color correction and manipulation.<p>If I'm selling anything here, it's the importance of learning see and observe. Drawing, and painting, are simply an immediate and practical method for testing and improving your observational skills.<p>(Plus it does come in handy when you need to whip up an illustration ...)<p>And don't conclude that design skills has _anything_ to do with learning the current set of tools, digital or otherwise.  Far too much design that I see these days falls into the category of ""what's easy to do with, or automatically baked into, the tools I currently use.""  Similarly, don't confuse design skills with production skills, which can be heavily tool oriented.<p>(Not knocking production artists and designers here. Theres a great deal of satisfaction that can come from designing a workflow and production pipeline.  And a good designer _is_ concerned with production because it can have a great impact on how their designs are eventually realized.)",1369532696

But I'm surprised it didn't mention the elite group who fly considerably faster:  private jet owners and corporate jet ""beneficiaries"".<p>These individuals are not nearly as price sensitive as the average consumer, and face much larger opportunity costs when sitting around at the airport or moving slowly in flight.<p>With some of the newer (and very expensive) private jets like the Gulfstream 650 and Citation X, passengers benefit from an approximately 15-20% flight time savings (depending on the length of the trip and desired fuel efficiency). This is a considerable amount of time for most c-level execs of large companies.<p>However, where I personally see the biggest time advantage in flying private is the process of actually boarding and securing the plane. Private jets and smaller airports are orders of magnitude more efficient.<p>Pulling up to a hangar at Van Nuys instead of waiting 2 hrs in the delta check-in line at LAX is well worth the extra money to the ultra rich. Time from pulling into the airport in your car to takeoff can be as little as 10 minutes.<p>In the late 1990's, as research on super sonic flight was becoming very popular, there seemed to be a divergence in thought: One camp was for larger, slower, but more comfortable airplanes; and the other for smaller, sleeker, uncomfortable supersonic rollercoaster rides through the stratosphere.<p>It would be interesting to see airlines' market research around higher speed aircraft, and whether there was enough demand for super sonic flights.  My intuition tells me they did perform this research, and the data told them that it wasn't economically feasible.<p>With the introduction of the A380 and other mega jumbos on the way, it became clear that the conclusion is that we'd all prefer to fly slower, but more comfortably. Though, while it appears we only have 2 market segments, super expensive and super cheap, there are some companies who are innovating on the fringes to make private jets more accessible.<p>NetJets and FlexJet are the first few that come to mind.  Maybe there's a YC company that can further optimize this market?  I for one would love to travel out of smaller airports if there were more options...",1369531699

Hopefully doing so will indirectly address the issue of evidence that we were discussing.<p>The main problem is that the BIG is an unnecessary and unhelpful concept.  I believe the sociology is that people like to believe in causes, rather than fine grained facts or principals, and so BIG is attractive as a cause in spite of not being a useful concept.<p>First, BIG confuses the issues around redistribution.  Assuming welfare is only conditional on income, the sum total of taxation, welfare, BIG and others, can be thought of as a negative taxation system.  BIG obscures this because it implies there is something special about redistribution through a ""guaranteed"" income.  E.g. economists are very concerned about the incentive effects of welfare, because every dollar you earn results in less welfare.  BIG obscures this by focusing on the flat portion (the guaranteed income) and drawing attention away from the more progressive income taxes that would be needed to pay for it.<p>Second, BIG is different from many current welfare systems because it is unconditional on being part of a special group (e.g. a parent, farmer, elderly) or certain actions (e.g. education, training, looking for work in good faith).  I consider this to be a bad thing, in that it is too extreme in the direction of being unconditional, at least for the developed world.  Both in terms of ethical fairness, political feasibility, and economic incentives, giving away money for nothing has strong limits on it.  Adding a few conditions, like ensuring people are really looking for work, strikes a much better balance.  So again, BIG takes a sliding scale decision (how much should welfare be conditional on certain actions, and should it be conditional on things other than income) and makes it seem like a binary decision by only providing one extreme as an alternative to the status quo.<p>btw, below I give a well argued article which claims BIG <i>is</i> a useful concept.<p>www.usbig.net/pdf/manyfacesofubi.pdf",1369531381

If your static type system is getting in your way, you need a better static type system, not a dynamic one. The same goes for dynamic scope—much as I like having it available in Perl and Emacs Lisp, it’s best used sparingly.<p>Memory safety is also kind of a no-brainer. I <i>enjoy</i> working at all levels of abstraction, and having control over memory layout is great, but I don’t <i>miss</i> it when working in a higher-level language. Compilers and runtimes for statically typed languages can usually be trusted on matters of value representation.<p>Efficient storage reclamation is something I’m particularly concerned with. In the absence of mutability and laziness, refcounting is an excellent GC replacement because you can’t get cycles. :)<p>I came to that choice from working with Haskell—it’s wonderful, but it suffers from performance issues due to the GC–laziness combination. Both immensely useful features, to be sure, but they come at a cost. OCaml hits a certain sweet spot: it uses GC, but also eager evaluation by default; has convenient access to mutable values; and the runtime uses unboxed primitives.<p>Windows support is…well, an unfortunate truth. The state of programming on Windows isn’t great outside the Microsoft stack—MinGW and Cygwin notwithstanding, as “using Windows to emulate Unix” isn’t the same as “using Windows”.

So we've kind of re-invented the null pointer exception, by having cases where the easiest thing to do in our program in response to some failure is to just abort the program.<p>The difference here is that the programmer is making a conscious choice to violate the option type by writing a partial function which escapes it. It also makes very plain and clear (via type annotations) which functions are allowed to fail and which are not (pure functions). With NULL pointers you're basically making every pointer in the entire program an option type with the potential to crash if you haven't written the boilerplate to handle it.<p>Oh and by the way, Haskell's Maybe and Either types are monads which can be handled very elegantly via do notation, simple combinators or monad transformers (MaybeT and ErrorT).",1369530590

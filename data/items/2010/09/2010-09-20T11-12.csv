I mean, if it's on your CV, it basically reads like ""I worked on something for 10 years, and nothing was delivered (nothing usable in real life, at least)"". What does the potential employer say -- ""Welcome aboard, we hate delivering products anyway""?<p>Also, how do those projects acquire new developers? Say, you're an open source enthusiast with a set of relevant skills / preferences (VM skills, programming languages, technical writing, FOSS project management, whatever), looking for a project to join. Why would you choose a project with a history of staying in ""experimental, unstable and incomplete"" state for 10 years, no deadlines mentioned and unusable for anything serious in production? At this rate, it will probably still be in the same state in 3 years; what will you have achieved by then? ""I wrote a lot of highly complex code / documentation, but almost nobody really uses it""?",1284983828

1708439,story,,,1,0,nuitblanche,"Ask HN: Your most awesome experience (UI/computation/language...)?",,"Here are three examples of what I call awesome experiences and while they are a little dated, I still cherish them. They are also very easy recalls as I can say exactly what changed at the moment I first used these models/processes:<p>* Back in the days, I used to write most of my graudate research with Fortran generated results... the process was excruciating. Then one day, I discovered Matlab quite by accident (Matlab was not part of our domain limited culture) and I never looked back, thereby becoming an evangelist on the matter with other grad students. The ah-ah moment came when I could produce in 15 seconds and 3 lines of code a graph that would have taken me much longer in Fortran. The example is simple but for the first time, I also discovered that a language could be an impediment in my thought process and got me interested in listening in on the LL1 and LL2 conferences.<p>* Some other times, the revelation is seamless. The UI for a search engine like Google really puts the search at the center of the user's concern. It's not about ads (well not in the first screen), it's not about building portals and categories (which presumes that you think in terms of category first), it's about a sober interface centered on the user and a capable algorithm. The HN login session also falls in that category.<p>* Another example is the pay-as-you-go payment process with Skype. For the first time, I was not paying for a monthly payment for my phone bill. The pay process, even if more expensive sometimes, is worth a lot to me and I now always evaluate payment models with this one in mind.<p>Do you have any other similar awesome experiences that swiftly became your gold standard for future interactions ?",1284983033

Ignore the fact it still feels stubbly, you're taking off the worst of it.  Now lather up again (avoid a razor on bare skin, that's going to burn) and do it again.  Finally one last time (having lathered up again) going up the face if you have to to clear up anything remaining.<p>Then cold water to rinse, and moisturise afterwards.<p>On top of this an old fashioned safety razor did make a positive difference both to how clean the shave was and the razor burn (remarkable given that it's one fixed blade) but for me the extra effort involved in shaving with an old safety razor wasn't quite worth it.  I like to be able to be a bit careless first thing in the morning while I'm half asleep and I can do that with a Gillette Fusion.<p>(Can I just say, for the love of god anyone making the move read up on how to shave with one first - it's not the same and you will cut yourself to pieces if you go at it the way you go at it with a modern Gillette).",1284980865

Lots of these things seem to be common across the experience of many people, but some of them while be uniquely yours.<p>But lots of what you'll have to do won't be cool or new, it will be tedious and time-consuming drudgery. Of course, it still might be worth it, but don't expect it to be all sunshine and light.",1284980766

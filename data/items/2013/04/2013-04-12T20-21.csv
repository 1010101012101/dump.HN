Why have we not put adequate regs in place to eliminate squatters?  I liked a particular domain name for a new startup.  I approached the domain name owner -- a FB engineer no less -- who had bought the domain, and I offered him a price that would have yielded him 7500 in profit.  He turned us down and continues to squat on the domain and do nothing with it.  We ended up going with a dotme domain, which isn't ideal.<p>Now, as a lean startup we probably shouldn't have been looking for an expensive domain name in the first place. But ineffective squatter rules (10K for an arbitration!) are preventing the marketplace from making the most of attractive, catchy domain names, and instead we're settling on domains that do not adequately describe the business.",1365800334

The amendment you're talking about would require all threat data to use (presumably commercially reasonable methods) to scrub PII. The concern there is accidental inclusion of PII; it's that disclosure of, say, IP addresses in NetFlow information might uniquely identify customers. But providers today aren't required to fully anonymize NetFlow when they cooperate with investigations. The amendment was a sensible measure and I wish it had passed, but its failure does not break new ground for privacy nor does it change the original scope of the bill. When we last discussed CISPA on HN, that amendment didn't exist, and I still didn't think the bill was scary.<p>The PII concerns I'm referring to involve the idea that CISPA could be used to frame individual citizens as cyber threat protected entities so that raw information about them could be shared by AT&T incident to some supposed attack. That is an interpretation of CISPA that was explicitly rejected by the bill's sponsors; they cite specific language they added to the bill to counter that interpretation.<p><i>(I didn't downvote you and don't understand why anyone would downvote you, but I could get downvoted here for saying ""water is wet"", so oh well.)</i>",1365800219

You need to rely on the weight of the law and the reputation of the seller to give you the material item you requested.<p>However, (a) that's not a deal-breaker, otherwise fiat currency wouldn't work, and (b) you can programmatically enforce rules on the transfer of <i>intangible</i> assets.<p>For instance, Namecoin adapts the Bitcoin protocol for the purchase of domain names, which are a limited but intangible commodity. If I buy a domain name with namecoins, the network itself enforces the sale.<p>Even when dealing with something that requires a central authority, like regular currency, Bitcoins have worth. For instance, if I want to transfer money between service A and service B, Bitcoins can act as a common intermediate protocol.

Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter have done the same.<p>But other companies, including AT&T, are far more likely to exploit this loophole (in fact they persuaded Congress to immunize them for illegal activity, post-facto): <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9986716-38.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9986716-38.html</a><p>Your claim that a company could ""not find authority"" to share emails under CISPA is close to the mark but not quite there. First, the House Intelligence committee rejected an amendment by a 4-16 vote that would have required companies to ""make reasonable efforts"" to delete ""information that can be used to identify"" individual Americans.<p>Second, data that can be freely shared with FedGov including NSA encompasses broad categories of information relating to security vulnerabilities, network uptime, intrusion attempts, and denial-of-service attacks, with no limit on sharing emails or personal data.

Kernel density estimation is also considered a non-parametric density estimator.<p>The kernel function you use does not depend on the distribution of your data.  If you have normal data, you can use an equation to provide the 'optimal' bandwidth in that case, but this is about bandwidth selection and not the kernel itself.<p>You can also, say, fit a spline to a univariate dataset.  We can also call this non-parametric in the sense that the number of knot parameters, etc., can grow with the data size.  This doesn't use any probabalistic machinery until you actually 'fit' the spline.<p>My takeaway from the original post is that you should probably be aware of how things work if you use them, or the defaults might bite you.

If people aren't spending money, then prices just fall until the people that are spending money can afford it.<p>But remember that the reason the prices are dropping is because no one is spending money. This is a <i>positive</i> feedback loop: the only reason that sellers are dropping prices is because they are under extreme pressure to make <i>some</i> income somehow. So they drop prices and receive a bit of income. So these businesses are then unable to pay <i>their</i> suppliers, who are forced to either drop their prices or suffer default, and so on straight up the chain.<p>So it's not that deflation itself is hazardous per se, but that it tends to amplify its own effect.

See Ask Patents <a href=""http://patents.stackexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patents.stackexchange.com</a> for such a community on patents, and <a href=""http://goo.gl/5YDHa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/5YDHa</a> for such a proposed community on copyright.<p>Anyone who feels strongly about these issues, please go get involved by ""Follow""ing the proposed CopyrightX community and submitting 5 Example Questions. With enough voting and other participation, the CopyrightX community proposal can graduate to an actual community like Ask Patents.<p>And with two vibrant communities full of good questions and answers related to IP law, perhaps future legislation will be free of perverse incentives, and we can once again rely on our laws to serve ALL of our best interests.<p>In the interim, thanks again Rackspace for being willing to continue the costly game of ""whack-a-troll"" on behalf of all of us.",1365798109

But we also don't want them to think that we're a bunch of rubes who don't know what we're doing, or to think that we'll do anything less than bend over backwards to provide the best possible support to those who take a chance on us at this early stage.  We also want people to know that we genuinely believe that we have what will be the best product offerings in our space, as things mature and we finish fleshing things out.<p>It's a tough balance to strike, but this post has me thinking about really trying a different tack on this.",1365797497

If people aren't spending money, then prices just fall until the people that are spending money can afford it. Sure you make less income, but everything is cheaper too so it's not a loss. Actually it's a gain. The same amount of goods are in the economy, but since some people aren't buying things, everyone else can afford more things. The pie is the same size but the people saving money haven't taken any slices of it, leaving more for us.<p>Besides when people save money, they generally invest it or put it in a bank which loans 90% of it back out.<p>>Countries have actually sometimes arranged to devalue their own currency to help with the local economy by boosting exports, so in that sense it is beneficial to have a central organization in your country's control to do that.<p>Exporting more things isn't necessarily a good thing.

Due to a flaw in the merkle tree Bitcoin used to calculate block hashes, you could trivially create a new invalid block with the same hash as almost any valid one. If you managed to feed the bad block to a node before it heard the good version, that node wouldn't ever accept the correct version because it ""knew"" that block was invalid. Do that to an exchange or wallet and maybe a couple of big mining pools and you could fork the exchange onto a different version of the blockchain, convincing them you'd sent them bitcoins when you hadn't.

They make an arrangement with developers where they reduce the price of their app to 0 for a day and in return AppGratis will deliver a certain  number of installs for an agreed-upon price.<p>App developers like this because it is a form of promotion for their app, it increases their chart ranking, and the next day they put the price back on their app and continue to get lots of installs via an increased ranking. There are also numerous opportunities to monetize those free users from in-app payments.<p>This whole thing differs from normal advertising in that apps like AppGratis drive a ton of installs in a very short amount of time.

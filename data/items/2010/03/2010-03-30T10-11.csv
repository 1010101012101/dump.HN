Explaining why things are as they are does show deep understanding of the language and a desire to learn the dirty details, IMHO a valuable trait.",1269946710

Also higher density displays allow for better looking user interface. I would imagine Apple wouldn't want to be outdone in either respect.<p>In short, I don't think we should draw conclusions neither from Gruber's post, nor from the densities of other devices Apple may be selling.",1269946614

However, the statement (like a lot of the rest of the article) sounds qualitative, and I take issue with that. The underlying problem is that copyright law doesn't work and YouTube's founders know it. They didn't have respect for stupid legislation and therefore pushed it as far as they could without getting in trouble.<p>I think it's imperative that lawsuits such as this aren't seen as a search for right or wrong. It's two giant corporations arguing about dollars and cents, so typical ethical standards we use when dealing with humans do not apply.",1269945458

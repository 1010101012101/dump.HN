What's really interesting is that there are only between 150 and 200 countries in the world.

There are 125 of these detachments (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Security_Guard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Security_Guard</a>). 125 and 150 are within the standard rounding error of urban legends, but there's probably another 25 countries you could add to the list if you count military advisors, peacekeeping/humanitarian missions, and even a handful of actual foreign deployments.<p>It's pretty disingenuous to count 1,000 Marines distributed over 125 embassies as stationing the US military around the world, if that's indeed what the people who came up with this number are doing.

For the vast, silent majority of normals, who know nothing of security but desire convenience above all, this means one thing: using the same username and password over and over. And it's probably a simple password, too.</i><p>> <i>This is the status quo of identity on the internet. It is deeply and fundamentally broken.</i><p>What I do is, I have a couple of hard passwords that I use for email and Dropbox and important services like that, and then I have a couple of stupid usernames and passwords that I use and re-use and re-use for services whose security I don't care about.  (I've arrived at this strategy after years of using the internet.)<p>A couple of times, I have actually tried to register an account with my usual username, found that the name was taken, wondered ""Hmm, did I already create that account?"", tried logging in with the usual password, and found that the login worked.  ""Oh, yeah, now I remember making that account...""  I took this as a good sign, that I wasn't wasting brainspace on that login.<p>I think my strategy works fine for dealing with ""a dozen websites who all want a username and password"", given that only one or two of them are critical.  And therefore I'd question the need to change, as opposed to people figuring out a strategy like mine and passing on the idea.  Also, currently, anonymous throwaway accounts are easy to create; would it be that way if sites required something like OpenID?  (I guess if the idea is just to reduce password complexity for customers, then sites could just add OpenID as a secondary means of logging in--rather than having it be the sole means--and you could still make throwaway accounts.  Note that I don't know anything about OpenID; maybe there is a way to do anonymous throwaways within OpenID.)",1290615254

My dad always brews his own tea, and he makes like 4-5 cups and then when the tea gets cold he microwaves it in a glass (yeah, not a cup, he's Iranian). Anyway, this is much simpler, I'm lazy and I don't want to brew tea, the cleaning and everything involved takes too much time, so I just use teabags. This seems so much better than teabags since I can use higher quality tea.",1290615006

However, it feels to me like what is happening in the software startup world is that, thanks to the falling cost of launching a product, the pie is not only being distributed to the smaller guys, but it is also shrinking... because the small guy is willing to put out a competing product in some cases just for the fun of it.<p>Edit: One more thing... I think the end-game here is perfect competition, and I don't think that will be good for anyone.",1290614994

From the original article:<p><i>RLB: Could you describe at a high level what Netflix is doing on AWS?<p>AC: Encoding movies for streaming, log analysis, production web site and API, most everything that scales with customers and streaming usage. Easier to say what we donâ€™t have there: most internal IT that scales with employee count, legacy stuff, DVD shipping systems, account sign-up and billing systems. We use Akamai, Limelight and Level3 CDNâ€™s for streaming the movies, which is a cloud based service. There is an AWS CDN service, but they arenâ€™t a big enough player in this space at this point.</i>",1290614670

We have green bars, yellow bars, blue bars...   Expect the pink-unicorn-bar any day now (IE9?).<p>So yes, currently the users are conditioned to look for the padlock only and you can get away with it in most cases. But I wouldn't be surprised if the browser-makers soon get strongarmed into displaying those ""unworthy"" certs in a less appealing way - crackled padlock, perhaps?<p>The net result will be more fancy address bar colors and even less understanding for the average user whether the site he's looking at is ""secure"" by any means or not.<p>This whole tragedy is one of the rare cases where I'd be glad to see legislation to step in.

I'll be graduating from university soon, and I'm looking forward to moving to a more hacker friendly city with brighter prospects. My question to the community here is... if you were in my position, which city would you choose?<p>Some background information:
I'm a bit of a laggard in graduating, being that I'm 25. I spent two years abroad in Japan, and upon entering university, switched majors more than once. However, my time has been well spent, working on various software projects.<p>I live near Boulder right now, but I'm originally from Detroit. While the Boulder/Denver area is certainly in a better position than Detroit in terms of tech related jobs, I feel that there are better cities out there.<p>Here are some cities and locations I'm considering:<p>* Chicago<p>* New York<p>* SF Bay Area<p>* Seattle<p>* Boston<p>* Houston/Austin<p>From a lifestyle and interests standpoint, any of these cities are acceptable. However, my gut tells me that the SF Bay Area is where I should really be. Some of my tech proficiencies are a bit esoteric (read: Erlang). So I think that given the large concentration of tech related companies in  the SF area, the probability of me finding a suitable job there would be greater than that in a different city. I could be totally wrong though.<p>What do you think?<p>Thanks for the help.",1237951490

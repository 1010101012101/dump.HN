The latter is often inaccurate.</i><p>That may well be the case, but my only other information source is HN comments, and not those made by detractors either. If there are sites or articles dedicated to the deconstruction of LW ideas, I&#x27;m not privy to them, nor am I interested in seeking them out. Basically, I only remember LW&#x27;s existence when it comes up, always accompanied by fawning comments, on HN.<p><i>> the reasons why the Basilisk does not work are _not trivial_ - it&#x27;s not a simple Pascal&#x27;s Wager</i><p>Correct. While my value judgement of both is the same, my reasoning about why the Basilisk is not a thing ultimately consists of more components. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s worthy of more consideration though.<p><i>> because with Pascal&#x27;s Wager, we don&#x27;t have the ability to actually create God</i><p>I would not say this is centrally important, because the processes leading to the creation of AGI are in all likelihood not going to be influenced by the existence of the Basilisk thought experiment either way.<p><i>> and in fact publicly stated that he won &quot;the hard way&quot;, without a one-size-fits-all approach.</i><p>Again, I have to take my cues from the perspective of an outsider looking in, and there are several people who commented in this thread alone who described it very, very differently. Of course, a movement is not directly responsible for all its fans and members - but among the advocates for the validity of the AI Chat experiment, the idea that out there is a mystical one-size-fits-all rhetorical exploit seems very much alive. It may be cynical, but I can&#x27;t help noticing how this aura of mystique and secret knowledge seems to work very well when it comes to attracting fans.<p>Of course, ultimately, these are just memes - and like many memes they propagate best when reduced to an absurd core.

9922274,comment,9921557,9921929,0,0,cameldrv,,,"The obvious but security-oblivious way to do this is to just connect the entertainment system that has the internet connection to one of the car&#x27;s microcontroller busses.  Even if it just needs to send a single command, it&#x27;s easier than adding another pin and another wire to the appropriate microcontroller on the other end.  The problem is that everything on these busses is completely trusted, and there&#x27;s no authentication.  The window motor can&#x27;t tell whether the signal to roll down the window came from a switch or from the entertainment system.<p>The simple solution is just to have a separate wire for everything, and source devices that aren&#x27;t supposed to control destination devices don&#x27;t get those wires connected.  The problem is that the automakers went to microcontroller busses because this creates a rats nest of wires.<p>The level 2 solution is have some sort of low-level filtering on the commands that are going out from a controller on the bus, so any command that the entertainment system sends to turn off the transmission doesn&#x27;t make it onto the bus.<p>The level 3 solution is to have some sort of cryptographic authentication of entities on the bus, so that the endpoint can decide what commands it&#x27;s going to accept from what source.<p>As you go from level 1 to level 2 to level 3, the system is more flexible, adaptable, and upgradable, but it&#x27;s more complex, and thus more brittle to attack.  Sorting out how to handle this sort of thing is going to be a big challenge as IoT pushes into more devices.",1437487135

When you load up a site I do it is as well designed as a mobile app.<p>You appear to have missed my entire point, which is that if I try to zoom, there is no reason to prevent me from doing so, as the fact that I have tried to zoom is proof your attempt at design to meet my needs failed, and zoom <i>might</i> make it better, and certainly won&#x27;t make it worse, while denying me will make me annoyed or angry and potentially mean I can&#x27;t use your site.<p>I can tell you with 100% certainty that you are unable to find a font-size, for example, that will satisfy everyone, as e.g. what is comfortable for me is too small to be readable for a lot of people.<p>Arguably, disabling zoom might even violate disabilities protections in some jurisdictions. E.g. in the UK you are required to take reasonable steps to make your site available to people with disabilities. Disabling zoom does the opposite, by making it harder to access your site for weak sighted people.<p>> Surely people don&#x27;t complain about the inability to zoom in their iOS settings app, or in the clocks app. Why would my site be any different?<p>Why do you think people won&#x27;t complain if they can&#x27;t zoom? The first screen magnifying application I saw was ca. 1986. And that was on a home computer where font sizes etc. could be freely adjusted up to very large sizes. People <i>still</i> wanted the ability to zoom to make their usage easier.<p>I don&#x27;t know about iOS, but on Android you can turn on &quot;magnification gestures&quot; and zoom any app everywhere by triple-tapping the screen. At least in my version.<p>But for e.g. the browser, assuming you&#x27;ve done your job properly, then zooming in a way that allows re-layout would save a lot of weak-sighted people a lot of panning that they are forced to do if they use the built in magnification since the latter doesn&#x27;t have any knowledge of the page structure.",1437486748

Everyone&#x27;s salary is some countries are available to the public.<p>Quoting from that Atlantic article:<p>> The worse the individuals&#x27; pay was relative to the median, the worse their satisfaction. Those at or above the median, however, experienced no change in job satisfaction or job search intention.<p>> These economists conclude that pay transparency just makes workers who are on the low-end of the pay scale feel worse about their jobs, so it accomplishes little. Linda Barrington notes, however, that this contention misses a benefit of being unsatisfied: the likelihood of moving on .... to another job, which would match that improved performance with better pay<p>Regarding the second, backchannels, again we can look to real-world examples to show how difficult or delayed those backchannels might be. Consider Lilly Ledbetter, who was hired as a supervisor in 1979. It wasn&#x27;t until (quoting from <a href=""http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1874954,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1874954,0...</a> )<p>> Shortly before she was due to retire in 1998, an anonymous co-worker slipped a note into her mailbox at work comparing her pay against that of three other male counterparts. Ledbetter was making $3,727 per month, while men doing the same job were paid $4,286 to $5,236 per month.<p>Quoting now from <a href=""http://www.nwlc.org/resource/lilly-ledbetter-fair-pay-act-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nwlc.org/resource/lilly-ledbetter-fair-pay-act-0</a> (emphasis mine):<p>> Her co-workers bragged about their overtime pay, but <i>Goodyear did not allow its employees to discuss their pay</i><p>She filed an EEOC complaint, which the Supreme Court said wasn&#x27;t allowed under the law because it the discriminatory acts of the past decades were older than the statutory 180 days for filing an EEOC complaint. The result was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which resets the clock after each paycheck made from the result of a discriminatory act.<p>Here&#x27;s another article, <a href=""http://www.financialsamurai.com/never-tell-anyone-how-much-money-you-make/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.financialsamurai.com/never-tell-anyone-how-much-m...</a> , which says, basically, never tell anyone else your salary.<p>Since it&#x27;s easy to show existing cases where people <i>don&#x27;t</i> talk about their salaries though back channels, your belief that &quot;people already talk about salary&quot; may be true for some, but surely is not universally true.<p>Plus, how many of those people are not telling the full truth?",1437486524

9922182,comment,9921897,9922126,0,0,WestCoastJustin,,,"At their most basic level, Kubernetes [1] and Mesos [2] both use a client/server type architecture, where you install a client on many compute nodes, then the server part farms out jobs (in the form of containers) to these client compute nodes. Mesos does not do scheduling, and is pretty low-level in terms of interfaces, so you would typically run some type of software which talks to it via API, like Marathon [3], Aurora [4], or Hadoop [5]. Then Marathon/Aurora/Hadoop/etc tells Mesos to farm out compute jobs to these end client nodes (aka schedules). Complexity can quickly go up depending on your hosting environment, scale, and HA requirements. There is actually a really good high-level overview diagram of what a mesos/hadoop/zookeeper setup looks like here [6].<p>The stack looks something like this for Kubernetes/Mesos (top down):<p><pre><code>  - Kubernetes and Mesos (client/server packages depending on node type)
  - Docker (container engine)
  - OS (Ubuntu/RHEL/etc)
</code></pre>
What are some use-cases?<p><pre><code>  - you have more work than can fit into one server
  - need to distribute load across N+ nodes
  - Google heavily uses containers (not k8s, but that inspired these patterns)
    - Gmail/Search/etc all run in containers [7]
  - Apple, Twitter, and Airbnb are running Mesos today [8, 9]
</code></pre>
There are a bunch of revolving services, like:<p><pre><code>  - distributed key/values stores (etcd/zookeeper)
  - load balancers
  - image registries
  - user interfaces
  - cli tools
  - logging/monitoring/alerting
  - etc
</code></pre>
But, to answer your question, the main difference between Kubernetes and Mesos, is that Kubernetes offers an opinionated workflow, built-in scheduler, and patterns for how containers are deployed into this cluster of compute notes. The pattern is baked in from the start via Pods, Labels, Services, and Replication Controllers. It also helps to know that Kubernetes comes from Google, where they have been running containers in-house, so much of this workflow (pods, services, replication controllers, etc), comes from their internal use-cases.

Also 256b versions of most FP (AVX) and int (AVX2) insns.<p>We don&#x27;t really think of that making SSE obsolete. More like, think of AVX as a new and better version of the same old SSE instructions. They&#x27;re still in the ref manual under their non-AVX names (PSHUFB, not VPSHUFB, for example.) You can mix AVX and SSE code, as long as you use VZEROUPPER when needed to avoid the performance problem from mixing VEX with non-VEX insns (on Intel). So there is some annoyance to dealing with cases where you have to call into libraries that might run non-VEX SSE instructions, or where your code uses SSE FP math, but also has some AVX code to be run only if the CPU supports it.<p>If CPU-compatibility was a non-issue, the legacy-SSE versions of vector instructions would be truly obsolete, like MMX is now. AVX/AVX2 is at least slightly better in every way, if you count the VEX-encoded 128b version an insn as AVX, not SSE. Sometimes you&#x27;d still use 128b registers because your data only comes in chunks that big, but more often working with 256b registers to do the same op on twice as much data at once.<p>SSE/AVX/x87-FP/integer instructions all use the same execution ports. You can&#x27;t get more done in parallel by mixing them. (except on Haswell, where one of the 4 ALU ports can only handle non-vector insns, like GP reg ops and branches).",1437486186

Because while you&#x27;re busy building a well-secured system, your competitors are busy implementing new features that give them an actual advantage in the marketplace. As unfortunate as it might be, consumers tend to understand things like “remotely start your car with your phone” better than “your ability to brake won&#x27;t be taken away from you while you&#x27;re barrelling down the highway at 70 mph.”<p>It&#x27;s sad and more than a little scary, but it&#x27;s also nothing really new. Computer security, at least in the consumer sector, wasn&#x27;t really a feature until viruses started showing up in the Eighties, and Internet security wasn&#x27;t really a feature until the average Windows user&#x27;s PC was getting taken over remotely the moment it was connected to the Net. Even Apple has only been able to tout security and privacy as a feature in its products by juxtaposing it to Google&#x27;s business model—had the latter not existed and its data grab become part of public discourse, I doubt that Cupertino would have been able to make so much noise about it.<p>So, it&#x27;s perfectly possible that every engineer and manager who worked on these systems is really quite competent  and perfectly aware of the potential for security flaws (indeed, I doubt that they would have been able to make something so complex work otherwise), and still the sum of all the decisions made and market pressures applied caused the resulting product to be so vulnerable despite everyone&#x27;s best intentions. It&#x27;s not because people don&#x27;t care or don&#x27;t know, but rather because there are only so many resources available, and the market has pushed them all in a specific direction that happens to be <i>away</i> from security.<p>But this is also why we need this kind of research. Now that these problems are out in the open, and politicians are starting to take notice, security <i>will</i> become a feature that the public will care about, and, hopefully, car manufacturers will start adopting (or be forced to adopt) better standards.",1437485933

Cars are increasingly taxed (inc. fuel tax).<p>It&#x27;s hard to legitimately say which is cheaper. Buses don&#x27;t need their own infrastructure, but they do need roads and these are often funded by various car taxes. Still, they often need subsidies to run. Many also have subsidized rates for poorer people on top of that.<p>Transport is generally expensive. I don&#x27;t think it can be taken as plain fact that driving cars is the most expensive method, especially outside of dense urban areas. If you gave those same subsidies to poor drivers, many <i>would</i> be able to afford to drive.<p>Excluding taxes, driving a low cost vehicle has a fairly decent cost per-km. A litter of petrol can take you 15-20 km in an efficient, small car. Untaxed, that&#x27;s <$1. If you travel 500km per month, that&#x27;s about $30. Add $110 for purchase and repairs (cheap car), $40 for insurance and we are at $170 per month. $5.50 per day. Pretty close to the price of public transport in many European cities, maybe less.<p>This is driving relatively little, but most car owners just consume more transport (travel more/farther) that public transport users. Also, more than one person can ride.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t take into account for infrastructure costs though, but public transport&#x27;s purchase price often doesn&#x27;t&#x27; either.<p>I&#x27;m not saying cars are better/cheaper, just that it&#x27;s not a clear win for either mode.

9922061,comment,9921895,9921895,0,0,bit2mask,,,"The &quot;level&quot; of a programming language is largely based on a function of the degree to which the language provides abstractions that separate the programmer from the details of the implementation in machine code. A low-level language provides few or no such abstractions; higher-level languages provide increasingly more abstractions that separate the programmer from implementation details.<p>Obviously, the lowest level language is machine code itself, which has no abstractions at all, and is just sequences of numbers. This is just about as low as it gets. Assembly language provides one level of abstraction: instead of dealing with opcodes directly, the programmer uses mnemonic names for the instructions, which the assembler converts into the opcodes. The assembler will generally also allow the programmer to give memory locations names so that they can be addressed in a symbolic way instead of by their numerical addresses. But the programmer still has to write each machine instruction himself or herself, keep track of what is in what memory location and in what register, and so forth. Assembly is therefore the &quot;middle level&quot; of programming languages.<p>The next step up introduces abstraction at the instruction level. Instead of specifying the exact instructions to be used, the programmer specifies what operations are to be performed and the compiler figures out the best way to do that. Programmers no longer have to keep track of what is in what register from instruction to instruction; the compiler does that for them. This also allows for programs to be written that do not depend intrinsically on the underlying instruction set of the computer. A program written in FORTRAN (the first language at this level) should run the same way on literally thousands of different architectures (although you&#x27;ll run into issues with the definition of &quot;number&quot; being different). This is arguably the gravamen of a &quot;high level&quot; programming language.<p>Unfortunately, once you go past this level (the level at which FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, and C all live, along with other relics like PL/I and Modula), it gets confusing, and often argumentative. That&#x27;s because beyond this baseline, languages add different additional abstractions. Not all further abstractions are compatible with one another, and different abstractions provide different solutions to similar problems. It&#x27;s not possible to arrange them into a hierarchy. Is Haskell higher level than Prolog? Is Clojure higher level than Ruby? Where does APL fit into this picture? SNOBOL? FORTH? (I&#x27;ve been around a while and have probably forgotten more programming languages than a lot of today&#x27;s programmers know.) These questions can&#x27;t be meaningfully answered because the languages are on different branches of a very complicated tree that has lots of interactions between its branches. In some cases you can make a coherent argument, such as when one language is a clear evolution of another, with additional abstraction layers added. So, for example, it is fairly reasonably arguable that C++ and Objective C are higher level than C, because both are evolved from C, and add abstractions that C lacks. But you can&#x27;t really say which of C++ or Objective C is &quot;higher level&quot;. And when dealing with languages that are not well-related to one another (such as, say Clojure and Ruby) it&#x27;s quite impossible to say that one is &quot;higher level&quot; than the other. All you can do is enumerate the ways that they are similar and different.<p>So, while I&#x27;ve seen people try to create definitions for levels beyond &quot;low&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;high&quot;, these definition usually reflect value judgments by the person making the definition (e.g. &quot;functional languages are higher level than imperative&quot; or &quot;languages with intrinsic memory management are higher level than those with explicit memory management&quot;).",1437485251

And in general, we didn&#x27;t let the migration tools write our scripts for us, we used them to automate the testing and deployment of our scripts, maybe that is the key difference in how we used them.  Which is maybe why I have never experienced what you are saying, when we added the tools in place, properly set things up and used them consistently we had less issues, and smoother deployments (not perfect, but smoother).  But again, they were larger teams all working in the same data sets so we had to have coordination etc.  Plus we had DBA&#x27;s that were gate keepers for the database systems, and we never allowed developers write access to production, that is just asking for issues.<p>As for some of the issues I have seen with teams moving fast or that are larger.  In one case we had around 40 commonly used databases, hundreds of tables in most of them, millions of data rows, multiple servers etc. Not saying the DB architecture was ideal, but it was not uncommon for larger systems at mid+ sized Enterprises I have seen as a consultant.  Many times it is when an organization is between rapid growth still and getting discipline that you see a lot more of these types of issues (larger teams, fast moving still with a lack of BTDT leadership).  The issues we saw between dev, stage and production were 1. the datasets were too large to replicate from Production to each environment, 2. security concerns over too many people having access to some of the data, 3. multiple teams split functionally instead of per sprint.<p>So how did these cause issues.<p>1.  We would not see all the data in each environment and while we would test across a wide swipe of data and also run queries trying to validate our alter and update scripts it wasn&#x27;t uncommon every couple of deployments to have DB scripts fail to run because of some data we couldn&#x27;t test against.  The toolset helped us a little here, because the DBA&#x27;s set it up to auto test changes against the production data before it would let the script run.  And every time a script would fail they would add new test cases if it warranted it.<p>2. Since not everyone could have access to all the data they couldn&#x27;t predict every outcome, see #1.  So the toolset helped us automate what they couldn&#x27;t see so we could prevent some issues.  This is very common when dealing with financial or PII in health care settings.  Also, this SHOULD and could have been mostly resolved by not splitting teams functionally #3.<p>3. Teams were split by their function instead of sprint.  We had a data team, analytics team and development, each working mostly independent of each other.  Meaning it wasn&#x27;t rare for the data team to release a script to production in the morning which didn&#x27;t get applied to dev/staging and then development comes along a few hours later tests and gets sign off on their changes in staging.  Then development deploys to production and has scripts fail to run in production or causing some data havoc (or vice versa between the teams).  Had the teams been integrated better this would have been less likely but still not impossible.  And I hear all the purist saying well the problem was someone skipped stage etc.  Yep, it sure is a core problem, but frankly in every environment I have worked I have seen it happen and so to dismiss it as it shouldn&#x27;t happen is naive.  Like saying well I am not testing for any errors in my code because there shouldn&#x27;t be any, uh huh.  So when we used the toolset it would tell us hey, something has changed here, and the DDL looks different than what you said it should look like, abort.<p>Also, most places I have seen need to routinely do production to stage and dev refreshes to help prevent a lot of these types of issues, which right there tells you that shit happens and it is nearly impossible to plan for all outcomes when it comes to complex systems.  So tools are the right thing to help you.<p>Last point, when we did have major deployments and a lot of DB scripts were going out, the toolset also would run through all the scripts and warn us of conflicts.  It would give us false positives sometimes, and miss some things, but it really saved our asses more than once.<p>Sorry for the length, just wanted to share.  FWIW, we agree the simple methods work, its just that tools and frameworks, implemented properly really do mitigate some of the human and process failures we all have from time to time.",1437484647

Poker saw a huge birth of statistical analysis from 2002-2008 when Online Poker was legal/legal enough in the US. People who only played live (in person at a casino) their entire career might only play 50k-200k hands. When online poker came about you could play 200k hands in a month. It turns out these so called &quot;best in the world players&quot; were just on a really good run. It also turns out it takes millions upon millions of hands to really find out if you&#x27;re truly a winner or just benefitting from the good side of variance.<p>This affect gets even worse because the so-called &quot;Best players in the world&quot; were MTT players and MTTs have the highest statistical variance of all.

The internet combines this system of information transfer with machines that know how to respond to messages without human intervention - under the condition that the messages follow a certain set of rules. By defining these rules in advance, the telegraph system, which up to now only transferred individual letters, can be co-opted to send things such as pictures and films.

This is, thus far, corroborated by the behavioral sciences.<p>In that model there are two essential approaches (aside from negligence) one can take: enforcement or empathy.  The former says &quot;it is in the greater good for this to be restricted,&quot; without paying much mind to the individual.  The latter focuses instead on the individual or condition and says &quot;how can I help this individual transition from a destructive state to a healthy one and/or integrate them into society?&quot;<p>I think we see the enforcement approach fail when banned activities can&#x27;t be clearly demonstrated to cause acute harm.  It&#x27;s easy to stand behind a law designed to restrict a deadly substance, reduce drunk driving, et al. -- that gets harder when you start restricting abstract behaviors that don&#x27;t have graphic or clearly-definable consequences (e.g. a drunk individual behind the wheel of a car is a simple and acute danger; I challenge you to quantify the impact of a generalized, individual &quot;gambler&quot; on society).<p>Regardless of your own value associations, we as humans are dynamic creatures and &quot;laws&quot; are static values -- that is to say they exist on a spectrum of opposing force that occasionally shifts dramatically in one direction.  I think we&#x27;re seeing that shift now through the lens of the failed &quot;war on drugs,&quot; in how innate these behaviors are to our biology.  You may feel better banning an activity that you feel is destructive, but you shouldn&#x27;t be so naive as to assume your ban will have any effect on individual human motivation when dopamine is involved--it&#x27;s deferring the problem, and distracting from the factors that predispose an individual to &quot;destructive behavior&quot; in the first place.<p>I do think enforcement is necessary (re: balance, the key to everything in society), but it&#x27;s hard to argue that the &quot;war on drugs&quot; (as an example) has done anything other than establish a black market global economy, the supply chains of which bring instability and violence to much of South/Central America... not to mention the egregious legal precedents toward non-violent offenders we have set in our own country under the guise of reform and in the interest of subsidizing for-profit prisons.<p>If we&#x27;re really interested in improving our quality of life as a society, maybe we shouldn&#x27;t regulate &quot;activities&quot; so much as how we respond to them in terms of statute and precedent...",1437484184

9921892,comment,9917773,9920301,0,0,tel,,,"Let&#x27;s try this one.<p>&quot;A monad&quot; isn&#x27;t a thing, but we can ask what it takes for something to &quot;have monad-nature&quot; or &quot;be a monad&quot;. For this to occur our something must be three things, a triple<p><pre><code>    (T, mu, eta)
</code></pre>
The names are all meaningless so for the moment they just get short letters.<p>T must be what&#x27;s known as a Functor. For PLs really, though, it&#x27;s even more specific. It&#x27;s an &quot;endofunctor on the type category of your language&quot;. What this means is simple<p>* For any (static) type `a` in your language, `T a` is also a static type.<p>* For any function `f` from type `a` to type `b`, `T f` is a function from type `T a` to `T b`.<p>If your language doesn&#x27;t have static types then you can approximate this by pretending that it does. Also note that `T f` is not usually the syntax used, but it&#x27;ll do for now.<p>Now to make a monad we take any choice of Functor `T` and give it two operations. `eta` takes values in type `a` to values in type `T a` while `mu` takes values in type `T (T a)` to values in type `T a`. In other words they give you a &quot;layer manipulation toolkit&quot;.<p>They must follow laws as well, but these laws are all &quot;common sense laws&quot; which allow you to think of values in the following types: `a`, `T a`, `T (T a)`, `T (T (T a))`, `T (T (T (T a)))`, ... as all being the same as values with just one layer: `T a`. This is the &quot;flatten&quot; idea.<p>And there you have it! Anything at all which can be regarded as equivalent to one of these triples following this design and laws is a monad!<p>---<p>So the real question is why should someone care? The answer is simple.<p>Lots of things have monad-nature in a typed language. By recognizing their common nature we can (a) see them in a new light full of perhaps previously unknown similarities, (b) share terminology lightening the burden of how to use them, (c) write generic operations which work over any monad and expect them to work with each specific one in a similar way, (d) introduce new syntactic sugar which is built entirely from (mu, eta) and expect it to work similarly for every thing with monadic-nature, (e) begin to form theories and impressions of &quot;what it means to be a monad&quot;.<p>The reasons (a-d) show up all the time once you recognize this pattern since monads are really common.<p>Reason (e) is what everyone wants to hear about but it&#x27;s hard to talk about without being super arm-wavey. But I&#x27;ll try.<p>In order to provide the operation `mu :: T (T a) -> T a` the type `T a` must be able to &quot;internalize itself&quot; without losing too much information. In order to follow the laws, one bit of important information is an idea of sequence or nesting—but one unique to each particular monadic triple.<p>In this way monads are a <i>very, very, very general way</i> of talking about sequencing or nesting.<p>What makes thins interesting is that you can see imperative languages as being about sequencing or nesting as well. If you have a listing of statements { X ; Y ; Z } then you can see { Y ; Z } as being nested in the execution context that X created and { Z } being nested in the execution context that { X ; Y } created.<p>This would maybe make you think that imperative languages have monad nature and indeed they do. This leads to an interesting study of questions like &quot;For some given imperative language, what is a pure-functional representation of the monad representing it?&quot; which sometimes has interesting answers.<p>What&#x27;s even more interesting is that one example of reason (d) above is to introduce a syntax sugar which makes <i>any monad</i> look a bit like an imperative language. This leads to an interesting study of questions like &quot;What does the imperative language for some monad X feel like?&quot;<p>So if you really like imperative languages and recognize that there&#x27;s a larger design space here that most have any familiarity with then monads are a good thing to keep an eye out for.",1437483725

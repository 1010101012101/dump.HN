3820608,comment,3820431,3820431,10,0,LeafStorm,,,"I admit, PHP sucks. But there is <i>one</i> thing it has going for it. It's simple to configure and secure a server that your general userbase can run applications on. I work at ITECS, the Engineering IT department at NC State University. ITECS is responsible for maintaining the server infrastructure for dozens upon dozens of university Web sites, most of which have dynamic content. Not to mention the people server, which anyone affiliated with the College of Engineering can get directory space and a MySQL database on.<p>I was once talking to our Systems people about, why not allow Python applications. They said that every time they have experimented with allowing CGI scripts in any language supported by their Web servers, someone has always found a way to exploit their sandbox. With PHP, the applications can still get exploited, but they have never had a breach that affects the servers themselves.<p>So if you're a startup or a major tech company who can spend time customizing a Web server and trust everyone who has access to it, then you're crazy for using PHP. But if you're a college with 8,000 students, almost 1,000 faculty, and a bunch of support staff in addition, and a good quarter of them need Web sites, PHP's pretty much the only option that will keep you sane.<p>In my opinion, that's something that seriously needs fixing. But it's certainly an explanation for why PHP is still around <i>now</i>.",1334030259

PHP is probably nuts. I've purposefully left out things like PHP frameworks, setting up a database, or doing any sort've advanced web development.

My current favorite method is to use mongoose to create a very simple HTTP interface for any C(++) project (mongoose is great!) and then use AJAX and JSON for any and all communication to and fro client and server. However, this leaves people that have JS disabled out of the loop.<p>My problems with PHP aren't so much the language as much as it is the environment. It's such a mess with so many dependencies that keep breaking any time you want to do a security update. I'm running PHP-FPM w/ nginx on Ubuntu LTS (Lucid), with the suhosin patch, xcache, memcached, and libcurl (I try to keep the external dependencies down to a minimum. PHP's 3rd party libs are so poorly developed and leak memory like crazy. They're also strictly non-TS builds, and will segfault like there's no tomorrow if used in a TS environment.). Trying to keep up with all the security patches means rebuilding a zillion different packages and applying a few dozen patches each time. It's not a piece of cake.<p>As soon as I've found a nice, convenient, and lightweight C++ web interface (wt is nice, but it's very intrusive and all your code becomes wt-specific), I'm planning a series of tutorials and open-sourced projects that can help anyone else interested in dumping PHP.<p>Honestly, it's not so much moving towards C++ as it is away from dynamically typed languages. I've had it with subtle bugs that appear only during run time and only when a certain codepath is taken with languages that let you implicitly define variables. I've come to the conclusion that implicitly defined variables and structures are of the devil himself, and no developer should ever end up working in a language where the compiler doesn't alert you <i>at compile time</i> that your codepath uses previously undefined values. ugh.",1334029135

WRT loosening semantics, though, in general you'd be surprised how close we come to quirk-for-quirk compatibility. The problem is that real PHP programs, including ours, end up depending, often unintentionally, on those quirks.

If components of an asynchronous system can wait on an event you can make it synchronous by driving it with deterministic synchronous events. Imagine a bunch of independent actors that always wait for a clock signal and then processing one piece of data then waiting for next and so on.<p>So I actually see a synchronous system a restricted case of an asynchronous system.<p>If you think about it, the world is inherently asynchronous.

3820443,comment,3818046,3818934,10,0,rdtsc,,,"> No programming language or tool can eliminate this complexity.<p>But some languages can help get you there.  Programming languages are tools and these tools come with idioms and paradigms of their own.<p>Certain paradigms help, often by constraining the developer to think and write in a way that makes the final result more parallelizable.<p>For example functional languages with immutable data structures help guide the implementation towards that. Actor models also do that.<p>Take a program in Erlang that someone wrote 5 years ago. They split it into 10 concurrent, cpu-bound, actors. Years ago it ran on a single CPU hardware. So the code was robust and it benefited from process isolation but didn't actually execute in parallel. It might have even been slower than the equivalent C++ or Java code.<p>Now all of the sudden there is a performance requirement. The site goes ""viral"" as they say. Now there are millions of requests per day not hundreds. If the program was written idiomatically correct all they have to do is get a big hunkin' box with 16 cpus and lots of ram. And all of the sudden those actors are working in parallel. No change to the code needed.<p>Next month the site goes ""pandemic"" so now they have to think about scaling beyond a single machine. No problem, they just move some of the processes (actors) to another node running on another machine. The way to send a message to an actor is still the same Pid ! Msg, just like it was in 2006 when running on a single core CPU. Still minimal code changes needed.<p>This is an example where languages and toolsets help guide developers in a certain way.<p>You brought the example of algorithms. The thing is, I believe, not that many programmers these days design algorithms, unless they are involved in research or are in graduate school. Most programmers engineer systems by stitching together components and APIs. I think with the right frame of mind and after some practice, it is not that hard to see how to split a lot of these components into concurrent pieces that can then be parallelized if the correct language and toolsets are used. It is often not the inherent problem but the way the mind of the programmer has been molded by years of applying another paradigm (ex. imperative, OO, mutable state).",1334026830

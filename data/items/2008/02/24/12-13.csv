Your post makes her ideas seem more attractive to me, but I think you're misrepresenting her.<p>I'll read the book. Maybe it's not as bombastic as this video. Still, from what I've heard about it, I have little hope.",1203857494

It proposes a hypothesis based on a verifiable doctrine proposed by a very influential person and then looks at the last few decades of history and tries to see if it can fit that hypothesis, which it seems to do very well, then it suggests that this doctrine is, in effect, an unspoken aspect of modern life.""<p>You saw all that in a five minute video? I didn't see much science in it. 90% was just showing pictures of torture videos or war bombings. If you think that amounts to verifying a hypothesis, I don't know what else to say (where is the example of societies that didn't change without a crisis?). It is exactly what I hate about that kind of videos: they exploit a weakness of the mind to connect unrelated things, to make you believe that connections exists where they don't. TV and videos are doing that all the time, but the case here was one of the more extreme ones.<p>As I said, of course politicians and power people are playing their game, and exploiting psychology is surely a part of it. I just don't see any connection to free markets, that is what I take issue with.",1203856413

You don't become one of the most economists with such a thesis.<p>Rather, I suspect that the quote was taken out of context or blown out of proportion. You can find something weird to quote from anyone. I am sure you could find a quote by Paul Graham and work it into that video to replace the Miltion Friedman quote, for example.",1203855821
122446,comment,122287,122439,0,0,NSX2,,,">> Her main thesis is that free market capitalism is bad.<p>Not really her thesis at all.  Her main thesis is that we're not really even given a chance to experience free market capitalism, we're just told we're experiencing it by people who are force-feeding us ""free market solutions"" during times when we're not thinking clearly (after a disaster) and that these solutions would never actually be adopted by people through a legitimate free market system.<p>I think she's not so much arguing against free market capitalism as saying that what passes for it is really a centrally-managed sham.<p>>> Instead, she attacks the character of famous proponents >> of it, by suggesting that they forced their will upon >> the unwilling populace. That's ad hominem.<p>She doesn't ""suggest"" that they forced their will upon an unwilling populace, she points to an actual, documented and verifiable economic doctrine of a person who advices presidents and Federal Reserve boards.<p>If she implies it, that is an attack on their character.  If they themselves have actually said that this is a good way to force development that would otherwise be impossible in face of free-market opposition, than they damn themselves - she's just saying, ""Look at their own words and theories, and see if recent history seems to follow this pattern, if it does, then these people are doing it on purpose - and they even claim as much themselves.""<p>>> The only way her argument could be not an ad hominem is >> if there was a causal link between the merit of the \n>> idea she is attacking and the populace's willingness to >> accept it.<p>I'm not sure, I wasn't there, but I doubt any of the people affected by the Asian Tsunami would have given up their beachfront property for chump change to major corporations in the hospitality business who wanted to build resorts BEFORE they were traumatized by natural disaste, like they did after.<p>Or take domestic matters - how many people would have put up with all the domestic surveillance B.S. we have here now if no such thing like 9.11 happened?<p>Or New Orleans - hospitals and such shut down to be torn down to make way for upscale property development - what resident would have agreed to that prior to Katrina?  None.  But after, they were in no position to agree/disagree with anything because most of them didn't even have a place to live.<p>I think she's basically saying that what passes for ""free market capitalism"" is a sham perpetuated by people whose ideas/solutions would never be adopted in a free market system and so they rely on the irrational emotions produced by disaster to get otherwise weak ideas through the market mechanisms.<p>In other words, if there were no disaster, many ""free market solutions"" that saw the light of day after disasters would never actually be accepted in a free market.<p>This then leaves open a disturbing scenario: at what point do people whose economic contributions would never be adopted by others unless it was in a state of fear, panic, shock, emotion, etc., consider it useful to actually initiate disaster in order to have their ideas accepted more readily?",1203855558

122442,comment,122287,122417,0,0,NSX2,,,"I'm not sure I understand; you start off with ""Bullshit!"" and then go on to say, basically, ""Of course what is implied in this theory happens all the time.""<p>I don't think she is ""attacking free markets"" ... free markets suggest a democratic adaption of free market solutions.  I think she's basically saying, in one way or another, that recent economic developments/failed developments are anything BUT free market developments; they are, as presented here, things that would never actually work in a free market society but rather have been shoved down everyone's throats while they were too busy trying to survive a disaster to actually participate in a free market.<p>So I don't see it as an attack on the free market system as much as a suggestion that much of what is heralded as free market solutions are anything but - rather they are force-fed solutions imposed undemocratically by a small cross-section of society which stands to benefit from whatever ""solution"" they offer to a crisis.<p>In other words, I think she's saying that most ""free market"" cheerleaders don't really seem to believe in free markets themselves and instead seem to believe that a small, centrally-organized group should centrally manage market systems (ie, communism) by exploiting people's weakness, fear, trauma, insecurities after a disaster.<p>""The movie just mixes togetehr totally unrelated things and claims a connection.""<p>Not really.  It proposes a hypothesis based on a verifiable doctrine proposed by a very influential person and then looks at the last few decades of history and tries to see if it can fit that hypothesis, which it seems to do very well, then it suggests that this doctrine is, in effect, an unspoken aspect of modern life.<p>To the extent that it can PREDICT economic phenomena, then that connection is very real.<p>I for one think the next time there is a natural disaster like a tsunami or something, people suffering the most will most likely be ignored while governments and corporations will rush to make development deals for luxury high rises, hotels, shopping malls, casinos, etc with no opposition from people too busy trying to survive to put up opposition.<p>""So who is Naomi Klein, a Super-Communist?""<p>It's funny you say that when all she's basically saying is that most people in the public eye cheerleading capitalism are actually behaving more like communists themselves ...",1203854411

The folk who laughed at the joke weren't meaning to be offensive either, but again, that's not a good thing.<p>There are no easy ways to deal with a situation like this - one group will advocate a quiet word with the speaker, and while that educates him, it does little for all the other potential future speakers in the room who learn from that session (or worse, put the joke away for use later on.) A public display of offense makes for an uncomfortable moment, which in turn should lead to at least more awareness that some material is offensive.<p>Incidentally, one measure of how offensive it is, is to replace the group in question with the most ""politically incorrect"" group you can. So had the phrase been ""explain it to a black man"" would it be funny? I think perhaps not.<p>As a rule you should never make fun of any group, of which you're not a member, from the podium. Just. Don't. Do. It. Self-deprecating humour is almost never offensive, even to the group you're a part of. Well almost. Clearly we can all imagine some exceptions to that rule too.<p>Yes the computing industry is enormously sexist, and it's behooves both men and women to point out instances of this sexism when they occur.

Even if wine, food etc is like ""consuming works of art"", their is an underlying tangible artifact in front of you (the food, the wine). Wine experts are paid and consulted because they can supposedly judge this underlying quality.<p>The ""interpretation as art"" comes into play, and is expected (different wine critics are expected to have differing opinions).<p>You wouldn't call someone an art critic if you could pass an Archie comic to him signed ""Picasso"" and he would believe it and judge it as a work of Picasso.<p>The same holds for the described experiments: changing your opinion on the same wine based on a more expensive label or a taste-less red dye is way more off than ""artistic interpretation"".

What is a good way to find a business-side co-founder with a great idea that needs implementation in addition to various networking events?<p>We are an experienced 3-person tech & product development team from Europe, looking for a new challenge. We want to make users happy, solve real problems and change the world for a better place.<p>1 of us is mostly a UX / UI / JS / graphical design person, 1 SW dev / frontend / backend, 1 product design / business (although with tech background). 2 of us have 10+ years experience of working together, the 3rd 2 years. We are a great match working as a unified team.<p>Our team experience includes designing, implementing and operating both consumer and B2B services, which this far have usually been on the scale of up to a few hundred thousand weekly visitors / ~10 distributed servers. A lot of our previous work has been very backend/database intensive. Have done some HTML5 mobile stuff recently as well.<p>We are pretty well connected to both US and European investors, accelerators and tech press. Have previously raised both angel and VC funding in US as well as Europe. Currently might be able to bootstrap our costs for some time from our own resources.<p>We are interested in a setup where we build the product development team in Europe and customer facing operations/HQ in the US. We know the challenges of distributed startup teams and why it is good to be 24/7 in the same room, but also believe this is not a problem with strong people, have seen distributed teams work out well if you know what you are doing. Willing to travel and spend up to 50% of our time either on East or West Coast, but not relocate permanently.<p>In whatever we do, we also take an active role in discussing the business, idea and customer experience side of whatever company we are involved in.<p>Our advantage includes also hiring additional developers and tech people at speeds and cost level times lower than in the US.<p>If you are someone with an exciting B2B or consumer idea who think this might be a good match for you and you need tech co-founders, please do contact us.<p>You can contact us at eutechteam@gmail.com or give some helpful suggestions / comments here.",1319977130

3174186,comment,3174082,3174082,9,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Oddly enough, I read this and came to the conclusion that the author was not so smart.<p>The premise here, that there is some underlying objective version of reality when it comes to consuming works of art (wine, food at restaurants, TV images, or even haircuts.) is extremely flawed. This article is like comparing the price of haircuts to the amount of hair removed. Yes, there is a metric, but I'm not sure it has meaning.<p>You drink wine or eat in a nice restaurant <i>for the experience</i> you receive, not for where the food comes from. Expectations are part of that experience, sure, but trying to assign it all to ""expectations"" is just a rhetorical dodge. How can anything experiential not involve expectations? It can't. It's ludicrous to think otherwise.<p>These things are not evidence of you not being so smart, they are evidence of the wonderful experiential nature of being alive. Isn't it great that we can plan and dream about a very inexpensive upcoming trip to the mountains and end up having a better time than somebody who spent 100 times as much for a much longer holiday? Or that we can spend an extra 40 dollars on a bottle of wine and imagine how much better the experience will be -- thereby increasing our eventual enjoyment? There's nothing dumb or not-so-smart about this. This is the human experience. Anybody who has ever spent any time around children understands that this subjectivity is a huge part of our makeup. In fact, to suppose that somehow this would be news to anyone is to assume the audience thinks of themselves as super-rational machines. Perhaps that's the problem: I'm not a member of the target audience. Still, I didn't like it. These books are the kinds you read and end up thinking ""People are really broken! They are pretty stupid!"" which is most likely the same damn thing you thought before you picked up the book in the first place.",1319977103

Once paranoia sets in, it's hard to cure. It's costing us (mankind - I am neither a US citizen nor live in the US) resources that could be better employed. I am sure the FBI folks would prefer to spend their time investigating actual crimes instead of shadows.

I've got no real opinion on the evolution of Ubuntu, but we must stop thinking about beginners and expert users as rigid, separated categories. First, there are many degrees and variations on the tech savviness scale. Second, people can learn. Granted, many people won't, since they don't care about the tools they use. But others will learn, if you give them computers that don't push toward laziness and reduce the steepness of the learning curve.<p>I think Mac OS, in <i>some</i> aspects, is a good example of empowering. For years, Preview and iPhoto had basic tools for editing pictures that Windows lacked. You can adjust saturation, levels, and so on. You can realize that these tinkerings can be not hugely complicated. And if, as a newbie, you end up stuck in Photoshop someday, you will be less scared and hopeless than if you had never used Preview.",1319976649

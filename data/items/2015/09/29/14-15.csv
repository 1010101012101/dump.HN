I had a plastic copy of it that I would spend hours rearranging.<p>For those who aren&#x27;t familiar with this puzzle, the goal is to take the 12 pieces and make a 10x6 rectangle. The 12 pieces are known as Pentominos, and each one is a unique arrangement of 5 squares connected on the edges. There are more than 2000 different ways to arrange the pieces into a 10x60 rectangle.<p>It&#x27;s a lot of fun!",1443538796

10296769,comment,10295187,10296066,0,0,Gankro,,,"Depends on the precise details, but generally speaking the nastiest problem would probably be the fact that `region analysis + type erasure = sadness`.<p>For instance, you can&#x27;t <i>just</i> have all your objects be some opaque thing, you need to know if it holds borrows into other types. On one end you can certainly do runtime checking (basically everything is a RWLock) which is slow and still just crashes at runtime. Or you can maybe do whole-program analysis (slow, weird non-local errors).<p>As far as I can tell, Rust strikes a really clean balance for region systems. Everything about signatures needs to be declared, and the rest can be locally inferred. But when you use type erasure (runtime vtable-based dispatch) you need to decide whether the erased objects are allowed to contain borrows, and what they borrow, upfront.",1443538728

I guess it&#x27;s just a different way of looking at land, and the history is a big part of it. The parks of the west existed before the land was touched, so they have an air of wilderness about them. The East Coast was largely settled, so the National Parks here (what few there are) had to be slowly cut from owned lands like you&#x27;re talking about.<p>It&#x27;s no better or worse, just different. I&#x27;m glad that Acadia is reclaiming the private lands for the public good, and I&#x27;m glad that Yosemite has reserved them to prevent them from ever being privately owned. Both are a net positive.<p>But I still can&#x27;t shake the difference in attitude about the land on the east coast versus the west. In the west, the National Parks are for the land itself, and I feel like a visitor being allowed to set foot as a privilege and an honor granted by the great wilderness so much larger than myself. On the East coast, National Parks and beaches and forests somehow feel like they exist for <i>people</i> and the land is there for us, and has no greater purpose than that. I find this in how people treat them and think about them and talk about them; it&#x27;s why I said &quot;Disneyland parks&quot; before, it feels like people go to them for their own benefit. It&#x27;s a subtle but remarkable difference, and it&#x27;s pervasive in the culture, I find.<p>No one will probably read this, but I find it interesting all the same.",1443538662

The former feature allows us to achieve very aggressive batching and GL state optimizations, since we always know we have the entire draw list available to us. The latter feature has two benefits: (1) it makes all these optimizations much easier to do, since there are no vector paths involved and clipping regions are much simpler; (2) it allows us to skip all the difficult, slow stuff that arbitrary paths require (CPU path rendering, complex tessellation, stencil buffer clipping, etc.) in favor of simple hand-optimized code that renders CSS directly.",1443538534

It often matters less whether you know something than whether you know how to strategically derive something. This involves an element of risk.<p>In tests specifically, you can usually knock out a couple obvious wrong answers. Then, if you are still not sure, you are supposed to decide which is the best answer. You take a risk with that decision.<p>To give an analogy from programming, say you are not sure of which algorithm applies best to a situation. You are stuck between two solutions which both look good. You can either stay stuck all day meticulously deciding which is best, or you can actually get work done and take a risk on which one you feel works best in the situation.<p>If you take your time on deciding which works best, surprise, a competitor took a hunch on a solution, got to market first, and put your company out of business. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if your solution was better in the long run. (See: Windows vs Mac OS in the 90s)<p>It&#x27;s not just blind guesses.

When you are acting upon a judgment of fact, one&#x27;s certainty in that judgment is a deciding factor in the severity of the action one takes in responding to it.<p>For example, suppose you have a family friend, Randall, who is accused of being a child molester. If you are perhaps 5% certain that Randall is a child molester, you would be justified in not letting your children stay at his house unattended. Just to be safe. If you are 51% certain that Randall is a child molester, that&#x27;s more certain than not, but 49% is still &quot;reasonable doubt&quot;. Ok, let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re about 90% certain Randall is a child molester, which is probably enough to get a jury to convict. 1 out of 10 times, that&#x27;s a false conviction, but that&#x27;s ok because people can be released from prison and dropped from the sex offender registry if it turns out they were innocent. Let&#x27;s suppose, for the sake of argument, that we agree that child molesters should get the death penalty. What level of certainty is needed before we kill Randall? Surely more than 90%, or else 1 out of 10 people we kill will be innocent, and while that&#x27;s an acceptable margin for imprisonment, it&#x27;s probably not good enough for doing something completely final and irreversible. So does the level of certainty have to be 99%--so that 1 in 100 executed inmates is innocent? 99.9%--perhaps 1 out of 1000 is a more palatable rate of innocent people being executed? 99.99% then?<p>The question isn&#x27;t whether someone is guilty, the question is whether we are confident enough in his guilt to take the risk of killing an innocent man. &quot;Is he guilty?&quot; isn&#x27;t a binary question of fact, it&#x27;s a question of certainty and implicit in that question of certainty is the acceptance of killing some innocent people as well.<p>The more nines we need to kill someone, the fewer people are left as candidates for the death penalty. Getting those nines means an exponential increase in legal costs. It also means spreading the fixed costs of execution infrastructure over a smaller number of executions. At some point, either you have to stomach a lot of innocent people being executed or the death penalty just becomes completely impractical, even if you start from the assumption that it&#x27;s morally justified.",1443537993

But if later, we have, say, an Account class (not equivalent to a Customer) that also needs a report, we find ourselves with two likely similar looking methods. I&#x27;ve found this to become problematic as the codebase grows, and ultimately your code exhibits a massive DRY violation.<p>2) His complaint about singletons is interesting but I think irrelevant.

In designing his grammar, Pāṇini used the method of &quot;auxiliary symbols&quot;, in which new affixes are designated to mark syntactic categories and the control of grammatical derivations. This technique, rediscovered by the logician Emil Post, became a standard method in the design of computer programming languages. Sanskritists now accept that Pāṇini&#x27;s linguistic apparatus is well-described as an &quot;applied&quot; Post system. Considerable evidence shows ancient mastery of context-sensitive grammars, and a general ability to solve many complex problems.

That&#x27;s why tipping is so important in that case: if you don&#x27;t tip then it&#x27;s likely the driver lost money on you, because they&#x27;ll pay more for gas and maintenance on their car than they earned delivering to you without a tip.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything special about 57.5 cents per mile when it comes to compensating employees, either.

Obviously the platform isn&#x27;t doomed, because the competitors aren&#x27;t much better!<p><i>Android updates have been incremental updates for</i> three years <i>now.</i><p>Hmm, OK! I have seen some news articles around that, but I can&#x27;t find an authoritative bit of documentation or official blog post. If you have a link handy, that&#x27;d be great.<p>I&#x27;ve observed in practice that all my test devices seem to do full downloads rather than deltas, though many of them are running older OS versions. And I&#x27;m mostly concerned about expansion files. It&#x27;s possible that the APK parts use deltas at least some of the time, though again, in my spot checks that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.<p><i>why can&#x27;t the developer do it, but also why does the developer have to do it?</i><p>What I&#x27;m envisaging is, the developer builds APK version 2 locally. They send a v1 -> v2 patch to the Play Store (which already has the master copy of APK v1). Use checksums to ensure it&#x27;s all working as expected, and in the worst case fall back to a full upload of v2.<p>Maybe from Google&#x27;s point of view it isn&#x27;t worth spending any engineering effort to help developers who don&#x27;t have access to really fast uploads. But it&#x27;s not rocket science and it sure would be nice.<p><i>A bug regarding expansion files...what is the point of even linking that?</i><p>I think it&#x27;s relevant because their recommended method of shipping a really big app is to put resource data into an OBB (a virtual filesystem), but the tools for building an OBB don&#x27;t actually work reliably. Worse still, Android itself can&#x27;t mount an OBB reliably! So if you care about stability and/or supporting a decent range of OS versions, you can&#x27;t use OBBs at all. You have to use a zipfile or something as your expansion file, and manage it yourself.

The human body I can&#x27;t recall exactly but if I remember correctly it&#x27;s centered around 20% or so for most exercises.<p>Two is that 1 m2 of a solar panel converts around 15-20% of insolation to electricity, whereas 1 m2 of random plants gets about ±0.5%, most crops around 2% and the top performer is sugarcane which is still at just 8%. Typical diet however would probably be 2% efficient crops, a lot of which is then wasted before it gets on your plate, not in the least due to a lot of agricultural output going towards animals who turn it into &#x27;meat-energy&#x27; in another inefficient process known as life with food-conversion rates of anywhere between 1.5 feed for 1 poultry, to up to 20 to 1 for cattle.<p>Lastly while we have regeneration capacity in our feet when say running, when cycling downhill or breaking we regenerate nothing, whereas electric motors can have 20-40% electric regeneration efficiencies when going downhill or breaking.<p>In short, electric bikes and likely small electric vehicles in general probably beat cycling in terms of energy. Of course this is a pretty narrow perspective. One can argue that solar panels and electric bicycles require massive investments which is an opportunity cost for other energy-efficient processes. One can argue that the cyclists fuelled by food will reduce their other activity (e.g. going to the gym) and thus don&#x27;t expand any excess energy, or that most electric vehicles today wouldn&#x27;t be powered by the sun, whereas the vast majority of food (excluding some greenhouses, hydroponics and pot installations) today is.

Imagine that what you usually want to do with segments are intersections and unions and if the original segments already have this x < y invariant, then the algorithms, if correct, will also have it. Therefore forcing usage of mkSegment will be a pain in the ass, because then you have to deal with the Maybe monad everywhere.<p>As @pron is saying, this is still a runtime check. And the problem is, there is no need for it unless you receive outside input that needs to be processed. Otherwise the internal algorithms should always respect the contract anyway. Consider this ...<p><pre><code>    intersect :: Segment -> Segment -> Maybe Segment\n</code></pre>\nWhat would a Nothing result mean? Would it mean that the 2 segments do not intersect, or would it mean that one of the segments was invalid? Treating the error in this signature is totally unneeded and forcing usage of mkSegment would do exactly that.<p>In Scala I sometimes use the mkSegment pattern that you described when receiving data from the outside (like from the database), but in this particular instance I prefer doing the following, because of the above reasoning (i.e. Segments should already be valid, input should be validated elsewhere, if we&#x27;ve got invalid segments then we need to fail as fast as possible):<p><pre><code>     case class Segment(x: Double, y: Double) {\n       require(x <= y)\n     }\n</code></pre>\nAnd I find this to be totally fine, in addition to whatever the static type-system can pull off.",1443535695

I know many, many people who only buy their break from the supermarket and that is all industrialized. Bakeries still exist, but many less do than several years ago.<p>For automation to be a success it doesn&#x27;t have to replace 100% of the market, and it&#x27;s unlikely for it to ever truly reach 100% for the reasons you mention.

There was also a program called &quot;lime&quot; that generated an LL(1) parser, but I&#x27;ve long since lost that code.<p>Lemon was intended as a yacc-replacement.  The advantages of lemon over yacc are that lemon has a less error-prone syntax (it uses symbolic names rather than $1, $2, etc), and that lemon generates a reentrant and thread-safe parser.  (At the time, yacc/bison parsers were neither reentrant nor thread-safe.  I don&#x27;t know if that has been fixed in the intervening decades.)<p>Lemon has always been open source.  But it languished with little attention for 10 years until I used it to generate the parser for SQLite.  Then suddenly people started to notice and use it.<p>Lemon does not have a separate version control system.  The source code to Lemon (a single file of C plus a template file for the generated parser) are part of the SQLite source tree.",1443535207

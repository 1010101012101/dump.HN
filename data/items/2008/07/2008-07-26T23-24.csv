In Finland, two sectors are highly subsidized via R&D: Information Technology (Nokia) and Forestry (which is highly scientific).<p>Interesting article: <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071127.rmtimber1127/BNStory/robColumnsBlogs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071127....</a><p>These two drivers for the economy surely reinforce the importance of science and math in school. Students are more focused on areas of study with practical applications (jobs) in their own country - hence high math and science scores. And where you have more competition you have a positive feedback look (Kenyan Runners: <a href=""http://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/2007/11/kenyan-runners.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/2007/11/kenyan-runne...</a>)<p>My two cents anyways.",1217116449

257857,comment,257588,257840,0,0,enra,,,"No. We only have one nation wide test, which is a marticular exam(consisting of atleast four subjects: math, natural/social sciences, Finnish, English) in end of the high school. Even there they only publish(with your permission) if you passed or failed. At the ceremony where you get your final report and certificate, they usually state in loud if you scored Laudatur(10) or Eximia(9)(in scale of 4-10) and thats about public at it gets.<p>In elementary you only get grades at the end of the school year, and for first years you only get stated that if you're good or not so good in some subjects. At junior high to high school you usually get grades(4-10) on single courses which are then averaged and rounded to annual grades. So particular exam scores are not so important. If you're a good and active student, a one bad exam won't affect your annual grade so much or even at all.<p>So grades aren't public, but usually other students and teachers know who is doing well and who isn't.<p>And I would add that none of our exams are multiple choice. In social sciences they are mostly essays and open questions, in languages vocabularity, listening, grammar, and writing tasks, math is math, and natural sciences are math and essays/open questions. So you cannot probably even fully compare your answers since sometimes there are more than one right answer and a way to answer it.",1217115490

But when I actually spent some time reading and evaluating the evidence, it turns out that is far from the case.  The official scientific consensus is that the jury is still out.  But there is certainly a strong case for the genetic basis - see this article in Slate for example:  <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2178122/entry/2178123/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2178122/entry/2178123/</a>",1217115147

I mistakenly assumed ""long time"" meant you'd had an account for a long time.<p>I don't know what to say about 1 and 3 other than that I disagree.<p>Edit: I'll say one thing about 3, lest I seem to be secretly agreeing with your nasty straw man. Lower IQ is a factual claim (which no one here has disputed - are you saying it's false? or just that it's offensive to talk about?). This by no means implies lower intelligence unless you equate IQ with intelligence, a leap that I personally find rather dumb.  lexlibra did use the word ""intelligence"", but the thread was entirely about IQ, so this seemed more like a careless word choice than an expression of racist hatred.",1217114909

It seems to me sometimes that Silicon Valley built something great based on widely available, merit-based, quality public education. Then around the 1970s they stopped funding that and started to rely only on prodigies from wealthy families, or outlier freaks from America, and the educational product of all the other countries.",1217114645
257846,comment,257491,257491,0,0,akeefer,,,"It might be an unpopular position to take here, but I really think that what I think of as ""language snob languages"" (Lisp, Haskell, Erlang, OCaml . . . not Ruby or Python, though) can't ever be mainstream because the barrier to entry is just too high even for competent programmers.  There's a network effect problem to be sure, where people don't use it because the docs/frameworks/examples/toolkits aren't there, but part of the reason those things aren't there is that the language doesn't appeal in the same way to people who want to build those things and the languages themselves have enough of an impedance mismatch with how people think about things to keep a lot of otherwise-competent engineers from investing their time in them.<p>In other words, it's not just about tools or marketing or docs:  some languages, while certainly more useful in the hands of a skilled expert, are so complicated and require so much dedication to perfecting their use that they can't possibly ever become mainstream.<p>The high barrier to entry for those languages is not just because of docs, tools, lack of standards, etc.  It's just an inherent part of those languages, and what makes them so powerful is exactly what makes them difficult to get started with and what keeps them marginalized.",1217114628

Indeed (and listen well here), failure to denounce x, if one knows x to be false, is WORSE than believing x.<p>This is the mechanism by which ignorance persists. The above is the opposite of education and what makes it even worse is when the silent party has the demagogue-ic status to immediately educate the many with a simple statement.<p>I don't know what you believe - as I said before I won't speculate. All I know is that if you knew lexlibra's comment to be nonsense, your silence (and calling it lame (and my comment 10x lamer) - <i>sigh</i> - just an embarrassingly juvenile response of the type I thought you sought to avoid here) says something you perhaps didn't want it to say; if you didn't know - I really should be spending my time elsewhere.",1217113840

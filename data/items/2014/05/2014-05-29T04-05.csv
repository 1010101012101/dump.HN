While it&#x27;s a funny skit, in real terms keeping on calling it &#x27;shell shock&#x27; would have been bad - because the PTSD hits you in other situations too. Victim responding badly to a rape? &quot;It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s shell-shock, get over it&quot;. That sort of thing. It was called PTSD because the same symptoms were being seen in relation to all sorts of traumatic experiences.<p><i>I also can&#x27;t help but wonder if the DSM is for physicians and pharmacists more than patients.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re overly concentrating on the failings of the DSM rather than the successes. Without something like the DSM, there isn&#x27;t anything canonical for doctors to compare notes on given diseases, and that is definitely bad for patients.<p>Also, mental illness is notoriously difficult to diagnose in the first place, which is why it&#x27;s the weakest area of the DSM, and why there&#x27;s a lot of overlap between mental illness diagnoses.

There are 30k vehicle accident deaths each year in the US (1.3 million world wide), and it used to be <i>much</i> higher (especially per mile driven).\nNumber of deaths per mile driven has been going down drastically in large part because technology has limited a driver&#x27;s direct control of the vehicle.<p>> Autonomous cars are fine - trying to take for granted that personal freedom is dangerous and stupid and that people need to be controlled like herd animals is not necessarily a good thing.<p>ABS/traction control/drive-by-wire takes direct control away from the driver and gives it to a computer.

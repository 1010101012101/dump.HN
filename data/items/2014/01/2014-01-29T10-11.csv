7143122,comment,7141496,7142356,49,0,csmithuk,,,"Actually no, you are completely wrong. It might be a popular opinion but it&#x27;s wrong.<p>Some facts:<p>1. Firstly, there are a couple of COM APIs that were broken with IE8 which mean that some horrible &quot;intranet applications&quot; that use ActiveX won&#x27;t work with IE8 properly. They worked fine with IE6 and IE7. These are now no longer supported by the vendors with no upgrade path so people are stuck with IE7 whilst applications are rewritten or disposed of. This can take years. In fact I know a company that has taken 4 years to rewrite an ERP system away from this model. The compatibility flag deals with some rendering issues but it doesn&#x27;t change the script engine or the ActiveX hosting situation.<p>2. No they can&#x27;t install another browser side by side and just keep that for legacy. Chrome has a poor privacy and configuration support. The GPO side of it really is crappy. Firefox ESR is impossible to configure using GPO. Not only that users don&#x27;t want to browser-juggle. Most of them don&#x27;t actually give a shit about any of this as long as it works.<p>3. Also, IE7 was released in 2006. I personally maintain software that was written in 1988. People are very quick to hang software, particularly the non-engineering background trendy startup pushing culture. IE7 isn&#x27;t going away until April 11, 2017.<p>To be fair, I&#x27;m recommending people away from the web and the cloud for business critical applications these days. The churn, culture and attitude (as your post outlines so readily) is very negative and a realistic 10 year cycle isn&#x27;t possible any more. People need stuff to work undisturbed for years for their investment to be recouped.",1390992422

Almost all patterns supported by LiveScript syntax are already present in JS and CS as a libraries. For example the cascade syntax in LS is almost the same as what raganwald&#x27;s KaTy.js provides semantically. Similarly, function composition is supported by more than one library (Underscore.js has &quot;compose&quot;, for example) and currying is also easily implemented in both JS and CS (see raganwald&#x27;s writings, for example <a href=""http://raganwald.com/2013/03/07/currying-and-partial-application.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raganwald.com/2013/03/07/currying-and-partial-applica...</a>), so once again the only thing LiveScript provides is a bit of syntactic sugar. Is it really <i>that different</i> from Coffee or JS?<p>In my opinion LiveScript is as similar to JS as Coffee is, just where CS adds syntactic support for more imperatively and OOP oriented constructs LS focuses on functional and declarative ones. Which are all expressible in JS.<p>Actually &quot;different&quot; would be ClojureScript, Amber or Objective-J. Or any number of compile-X-to-js projects.",1390992068

7143083,comment,7141660,7142170,13,0,netcan,,,"I&#x27;m far from an expert. In a lot of cases, what you say seems true. The Nationalization angle is BS for sure. But, there are some differences that <i>are</i> important. Foreign depositors did not get bailed out, not by Iceland. That in itself is a big deal. That&#x27;s a clearer definition at least of what a bailout is. The banks went bust and deposits were lost. Then foreign central banks returned some despots to <i>their own citizens.</i> Iceland paid out its own citizens and some depositors were not guaranteed by anyone.<p>It&#x27;s clear for instance that UK public money went to UK depositors. The UK is entitled (though maybe unwise) to do this and it sets up a framework for explicit guarantees. In Ireland&#x27;s case, god knows who really got bailed out. The EU loaned Ireland money to loan to their banks to pay back depositors who were other banks..etc. There was pressure from Germany as both the source of much of the financing and the destination of much of it (Irish banks owed money to German banks). No one went bankrupt, for a normal definition of the term.<p>It amounts (in my limited understanding) to a few important difference that leave the system far more robust. (1) there is some transparency. It is knowable who is getting bailed out and where the money is coming from. (2) Some long tail risk is put onto depositors, especially foreign/large depositors so it can be priced in. A Hayekian sort of systemic risk reduction. (3) It appears to have reduced the flow of money from poorer future people to current rich people. (4) It clearly defines depositor bailouts as depositor bailouts. Money goes from the public purse to Ms Gunnarsdotter&#x27;s. In other bailouts (Ireland) the public was driven to fear that banks would collapse and their savings wiped out unless some unknown quantity of money was put into an unknown funnel from where it would flow (among other places) back into their deposit accounts.<p>IMO we need to come to a long term setup that is simple enough for a first year economics student to understand and first year finance student to price. A guarantee is fine, if we can set it to an affordable level (say, deposits up to €25k) payable directly from the government to <i>qualifying</i> depositors with potential recovery by a bankruptcy court.",1390991404

In the datacentre, heat determines how much computation you can do in the volume of space you have, and how much you have to spend on cooling systems (the running of which is expensive too). So datacentre operators that already have a building are facing a choice: get a new building, or make better use of the one they have.<p>ARM cores are typically slower in absolute terms than Intel cores, but at a given level of power, you can run more of them.",1390989839

Unfortunately continuing to date both of them is unsustainable so I must choose one. In order to make such a choice, I wish to construct a ranking function - a function which takes as input the characteristics of a woman and returns as output a single number. This ranking function is meant to approximate my utility function - a higher number means that by making this choice I will be happier. If the ranking closely approximates utility, then I can use the ranking function as an effective decisionmaking tool. In concrete terms, I want to build a function f:Women→ℝ which approximately predicts my happiness. If f(Svetlana)>f(Elise) I will choose Svetlana, and vice versa if the reverse inequality holds.</i><p>Yeah I don&#x27;t think readers who disliked your choice of &quot;models&quot; necessarily count as &quot;social justice warriors.&quot; I figured the post itself was just meant to troll people in an attempt to show how superior your powers of logic and math were.",1404676795

7995468,comment,7991152,7994298,1,0,rapala,,,"Recipes and other manuals are also extremely vague when compared to computer programs. Humans have such vast amounts of context and prior knowledge available to them that pedantic instructions are not needed. The only prior knowledge the computer has is the rest of the program. For this reason I don&#x27;t like the comparison of natural language and programming languages very much.<p>I would argue that we use recursion quite a lot. For example, here&#x27;s how clean a bunch of dishes. If the bunch is no more, your done. Otherwise, take a dish and clean it. Then clean the rest of the dishes like you did with the first one. We often leave out the end condition as it is often clear from the context.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating a deep knowledge of math as I know from experience that it has very few applications in software development. But to me a professional is someone who is not just skilled but knows the history and fundamentals of his trade. He knows not just that <i>for (i = 10; i > 0; i--)</i> terminates but also has an idea why that is so (and what it means that a program terminates).<p>Why would recursion be any more dangerous than iteration?",1404676524

This seems like the other side of the same coin.<p>Look over your facebook or twitter feed whenever some significant event happens -- the Hobby Lobby court decision, a vote on same-sex marriage, even a sporting event.  People will, for the most part, divide into camps of rage or euphoria.  There&#x27;s very little recognition of the validity of other points of view, very rarely mixed feelings, and often rejection of any facts that might potentially support another conclusion.  In my experience, those who express any sort of nuance or recognition of key points from multiple sides tend to be treated disrespectfully (not merely argued with, but mocked, insulted, unfriended, stuff like that.)<p>It&#x27;s as if everyone has been taught to act like an extremist troll in order to avoid the ire of extremist trolls.",1404676438

Ideally we want to &quot;empower interest-based communities to rank the best stuff out there&quot;. That sounds gay, and it is - but at the same time, it&#x27;s true. I love red wine for example; and it can be really hard finding comparative lists between different kinds of red wine. Sure, you have Vivino (the app), but that is all kinds of fucked up. So I might want to create a list called &quot;Best wines from Tucany&quot;, which directly compares the wine.

7995451,comment,7995074,7995074,18,0,tzs,,,"> Last month, Google announced its plan to spend $50 million over the next three years encouraging young women to give coding a try. The website for the project features articles about inspiring women, like Erica Kochi, who leads UNICEF&#x27;s Innovation Unit. The first item on a page of coding projects for girls to try is a 3-D-printed bracelet.<p>> &quot;It&#x27;s insulting, not only because it&#x27;s highly gendered, but also because it perpetuates this idea of women as consumeristic and narcissistic,&quot; said Losh. &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like a trifecta of badness.&quot;<p>Professor Losh needs to do some field research. A few hours hanging out in a mall or other place popular with young people will show that a large fraction of young women do in fact do seem to have quite an interest in jewelry.<p>Including a 3D bracelet project sends the message to young women who have not considered coding that it can be a part of their current world. It&#x27;s something they can apply to their lives, not something they have to change their lives in order to use.<p>What&#x27;s insulting is Losh&#x27;s implicit assumption that women who wear bracelets must be doing it because they are narcissistic and consumeristic. Why can&#x27;t they wear them for aesthetic reasons? Or sentimental reasons?",1404676180

It&#x27;s for this same reason I don&#x27;t believe so much his argument for readability and short classes - breaking everything up does not make things simpler, it makes the complexity spread out over a larger area; while it may be true that it is easier to understand an individual piece, it becomes more difficult to understand the system as a whole.<p>Preach it!

I&#x27;d just hope that you have a seriously tight set of acceptance criteria put down in writing that legally binds them to a definition of &quot;done&quot;.

Anyone complaining about basically anything then becomes a maladapted pest- we are all self-interested, the HNer believes, so those who openly claim to be outraged on behalf of what is happening to others are just looking for something to get upset about.<p>It goes hand in with this romanticized view of what a &quot;real&quot; activist does:<p><i>>> Ultimately, Internet outrage is the milquetoast cousin to direct action, a way to protest by tapping and clicking rather than boycotting and marching. It is a noble endeavor to become incensed about a cause and risk arrest or toil without acclamation for one’s deeply held beliefs. Less honorable is joining a digital pile-on as a means of propping up one’s ego, even if it comes in the form of entertaining zings.</i><p>Although social justice is always an uphill struggle against the entrenched power, apathetic bystanders request again and again that its advocates handicap themselves- no social media, no having fun, no heroes, toil in silence else you&#x27;re doing it for ego.

7995423,comment,7994673,7994673,44,0,gexla,,,"Four hours per day of work where you are in high focus is about normal. You will see that professionals across many creative fields only work 4 hours per day.<p>There are a lot of posts here from developers talking about how they are more productive than their peers working less hours. Really, they probably have the same capacity for hours, but the less productive developers are carrying a lot of baggage in attempting to manage themselves (trying to push themselves when they shouldn&#x27;t be.)<p>I think you could actually put in more. The trick is to observe your own natural rhythm. For example, energy and your ability to focus is like a wave through the day. For most, I think the time of the most energy is early in the morning and then it declines from there. You aren&#x27;t burning hours so much as you&#x27;re burning that fuel in your brain.  But if you put in your 4 hours early, then you could probably take a good break and get another good 90 minute session.  You could also find other tasks that are much less cognitive demanding to fill your day. If you put in your 4 hours that you believe are more productive than what your peers put in, then fill out the rest of the day with things that are lighter and less &quot;forced.&quot;<p>If you are running a business, then after your creative work you still might have email, quotes, meetings, marketing, billing and a long list of other things to do. It could be pretty easy for a business manager to knock out 4 hours of creative work per day and then still fill out the rest of a normal working day with other tasks.<p>If you didn&#x27;t have these other sorts of tasks, then maybe you could work out a side project with your employer. After you do the &quot;forced&quot; work, then maybe there is something that you could work on which is more a &quot;scratch an itch&quot; type of project. This could be something that you see as a glaring problem for the business which also happens to be something that you are highly interested in. Maybe it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s a different area of expertise that you might want to move into in the future.<p>Or maybe your 4 hours is all you can do without burning out.",1404675665

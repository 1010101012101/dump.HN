Then, that 80%, who is unemployed, will work on making sure the agriculture is healthy, harmless, diverse, etc. You can expand this thinking to anything else, but regulation is the key. By regulating you create jobs that weren&#x27;t possible in a pure free market.<p>And of course don&#x27;t forget the entire realm of possible jobs we can&#x27;t even phantom about these days. Jobs such as a &quot;ventriloquist&quot; should not be ridiculed. Our societies should nurture the diversity of possible things that can be done via regulations and laws and minimum wage.<p>Then you still have those people that simply don&#x27;t want to do anything. Which is fine, but if you give them a very large spectrum of possibilities to choose from, and not limit them to a few fields, they will probably find something they like and contribute to the whole system.<p>But again, the key here is that the government must regulate the free market to expand the possible amount of jobs - this is important because these jobs are not created by the free market, but rather are needed for reasons such as our health, culture, research, exploration... we need more of these.",1445684197

Compared to some other big cities London feels more &#x27;human friendly&#x27; (for want of a better term), wide streets can make a place feel more car focused, less a place that feels like a destination and more somewhere you travel through to get to where you want to be.

I think in London the problem is that brits have this curious obsession with owning property and be willing to bid as much as they legally can, burrying themselves into debt, in order to achieve that.

Please forgive this, as I didn&#x27;t have anywhere else to post it.<p>In the first link, it says,<p>>According to the 2012 CIA World Factbook, 98.5% of the residents of Japan are ethnically Japanese. Doujinshi arose largely due to the uniformity of intention, good will, perception, and morality of Japanese people.<p>This seems a rather poor reason to me.

As someone who isn&#x27;t ethnically Japanese in Japan, it makes me feel uneasy as it just seems to be widening this gap that people make between ethnicities and countries of origin, especially with regard to Japan.<p>It&#x27;s a borderline 日本人論 statement that I&#x27;ve seen is popular in Japan. Countless books about &quot;Japanese style&quot; and how it&#x27;s accomplished through the &quot;harmony&quot; achieved by something innate in Japanese people or culture (that God forbid cannot be learned, silly foreigner! /s) that&#x27;s brought about through the fact that Japan is an ethnically homogeneous country.<p>tl;dr rant about how I think the author makes a link between two unrelated things, and furthers the divide between two groups of people while still managing to be offensive during the course of it.",1445683172

I found a great team while finishing my masters degree at the university.\nEven though founding a company is a ton of work, you learn a lot by doing so. Thus, here is the advice I can give:<p>Silicon Valley is a good place for you to go when you need to get in touch with other tech companies. But in order to find skilled developers you don&#x27;t need to go to Silicon Valley at all. I&#x27;m living in Austria and I know that there are excellent developers right here (and I bet the same is true for Germany). You just have to know where to find them. And once you found them you need to start talking to them. I know its hard to tell total strangers about your big idea, but it needs to be done. \nYou don&#x27;t need to worry about someone stealing the idea as long as you and your expertise are still required. If the developer you told about the idea wanted to do it without you, he would face exactly the same problem as you do right now. He would need to find someone like you. And convince him of your idea. So why should he bother stealing the idea in the first place if he could just join you?<p>So, where do you find people that have a technical background and are also prepared to take some risks?\nGo to coworking spaces. That is where you find people that may be working as freelancers or in small teams up to 3 or 4 people (if the team gets bigger than that its often cheaper to rent an office for your own). But maybe you shouldn&#x27;t just walk in there and distract people from their work.\nFrom time to time such coworking spaces host events. Usually they post about it somewhere on the web. And usually the people that work at the space go to such events. So this would be an ideal chance for you to talk to people that are both talented and not bound to a fixed job. \nMy advice: Go there.<p>And now a suggestion concerning investors and money: Consider public funding. There are many funds that you don&#x27;t have to pay back and in contrast to an investor the funding organizations don&#x27;t ask for shares.",1445681789

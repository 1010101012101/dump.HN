Instead, have a single new functionality, maybe along the lines of ‘New ! Option to save your work’. The rest should be all bug fixes.

""And everyone said, 'Absolutely not.' ""<p>> Neitz and his team tried the experiment anyway.<p>Doing the experiment is empiricism; relying on a conceptual theory is rationalism.  Theory is effective for predicting the logical consequences of what is already known; it cannot predict anything else. Whereas empiricism can discover things which are not dreamed of by a particular theory.<p>Even the famous examples of rationalism, such as Einstein's theory of relativity, and Maxwell's equations which predicted radio waves, were based on empirical observations: that the speed of light appears to be constant in all directions (inconsistent with an <i>ether</i>); and Faraday's observation that a magnetic field can affect the polarization of light, respectively.<p>Excessive rationalism is popular in software researchers, but it is not appropriate for any software that interacts with reality - as all useful software does.",1253190864

Those customers they are pissing off, but aren't seeing leave, are staying because there isn't another option; as soon as there is, the exodus will begin. As it does, this company is screwed, because the mediocrity they worked into their codebase assures they will be able to react about as swiftly as rock can to someone threatening to kick it.<p>This is not the first appeal to mediocrity I've heard, but the authors or orators I've heard make this same appeal in the past are really offering an apology for their own apathy. They <i>want</i> this to be true, regardless of veracity, because then it will justify their own desire to not give a shit. They hope that their self-fulfilling prophecy becomes the same to everyone else, so no one is forcing them out of mediocrity. No one is making them actually work for their monthly lifestyle installment, and instead join them resting on past achievements, hoping this grants all of us a perpetual annuity.<p>On the other hand, if this <i>is</i> satire, it's really bad satire.<p>Oh, and to reflect on his clever quip about spelling: yes, I did catch the spelling mistakes, and they did piss me off.

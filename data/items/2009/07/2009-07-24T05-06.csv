721060,comment,720742,720742,0,0,nick-dap,,,"As an online organizer I can say that this is the best website I've discovered in ages. I am craving for this information and have been unable to find much sources that focus specifically on the issues that I face. Thank you for linking to this site! Really, thank you!<p>The article itself couldn't be truer. I see organizations going head over heals into social media thinking that there is some mother load of new ""activity"" at the middle of it. In reality all they are doing is waisting time that they should be spending doing ""traditional organizing"".<p>Community organizing is by far time better spent. I will submit to the experiences of a community organizer any day of the week. These people are the ones making any difference. They are the ones nurturing real connections with real people. By contrast, friending on Facebook is close to meaningless. We, online organizers, are here for a ride trying to figure out what to do with this relatively new medium (the Internet in general). The best tool an organizer has in her arsenal is a face to face meeting where you can build a real connection. This tool is taken away as soon as you move online.",1248415101

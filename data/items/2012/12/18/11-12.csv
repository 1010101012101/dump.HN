Brand extension is a crime against marketing and against common sense.<p>The reasoning goes like this:<p>- we have a strong brand<p>- we have a new product<p>- no one will know this new product exists unless we spend huge amounts of advertising to inform the public about its existence<p>- oh but wait! we have this strong brand! why not attach the new product to the existing brand, to jump start it?!<p>- (and BTW, our strong but old brand can only benefit from this hot new cool product being attached to it)<p>At first it seems to work: the new product grows faster with brand extension than without.<p>But very fast, people become confused about which is which and what does what, and prefer two uniquely branded and well-positioned competing products against the whole ""line offering"".<p>The ""hot new product"" usually ends up polluting, weakening, if not killing the parent brand, instead of rejuvenating it.<p>This is exactly what is happening with Windows RT.<p>Microsoft isn't the only culprit however.

4937059,comment,4934855,4936428,4,0,pfisch,,,"No I am just being realistic as an actual game developer.  This is not a conceptual discussion.  It doesn't make any sense to implement this change because if your fixed timestep for the physics system is breaking down then gravity not calculating correctly is the least of your problems.  The controls would be unresponsive if the dt became large anyway.  You are talking about more than doubling the number of operations for all acceleration based movement which is just about every movement and applied force in the game.  If you thought the framerate was hurting before because too many objects were on screen doubling the physics calculations is not going to help you out.  It might not hurt that bad but it really depends, you would need to profile it.  It doesn't matter though because the tunneling would be another bigger issue that you would also have to address for this to even matter, and that would definitely hurt bad to check for.<p>During the far majority of use cases the timestep is fine, and you are just creating deadweight by doing this.  Plus I guess you are now doing tunneling checks as well to create further deadweight for the rare occasion when someone has framerate issues.<p>I am looking at this in the sense that I would actually implement this in a game I make, and I would not because the upside of doing this is basically ""if the game is already fucked I want it to be maybe not as fucked but still having many other big issues with pretty much every other component of the game logic"", vs a bunch of deadweight when the game is running correctly, which should be 99.5% of use cases.<p>Am I adding assumptions here?  I guess so but they are real ones for real game developers.

Have you felt that language was pushing down its own self believed principles down your throat? What happens when programmers face such situations? They just leave the tool and go to something else. Perl is one of those few tools that adapts to the programmer, rather than expecting the programmer adapt to it.<p>Now like every other design choices you can ever make, it has its own tradeoffs. Being flexible, adaptive, powerful and quick to evolve means at times you have to sacrifice a little consistency. You can sure present your arguments and your design perspective against it, but your design again will have its own trade offs.<p>Why so many different ways of doing things? For example why do we have something like 'map' and 'foreach' in Perl? You won't understand this when you have used and written code that leverages these keywords to their power. Its more or less like explaining why Ice cream is delicious to somebody who has never eaten it. Unless you taste it yourself won't truly understand.<p>Perl is quick to learn. You can learn as much Perl to do the kind of work you can do in Python/Java/whatever. But as you learn more Perl, you become productive at solving problems. You can do it quickly, with succinct code with more powerful syntactical features.<p>EDIT:Corrected typo.",1355828663

Because OCaml is eagerly evaluated and that its compiler is extremely simple, I find that the ""tools"" that I learned in school and in my time coding in other languages apply to making OCaml code fast (and predictibly fast).  With Haskell, you need to be more keenly aware of how evaluation is handled, and I guess I have still a lot of things to learn there, because I still have problems making really simple Haskell functions that don't crash.",1318931063

Everyone who wrote some web/servlet code, that needs to output stuff to the web over several classes (might not be the best design in the beginning) uses a Writer (or other class) to aggregate output. He therefore, as global vars are bad (and thread local are worse ;-) adds a Writer to every method.<p>public T doSomeStuff(T input, Writer io)<p>This is nasty and ugly, and the IO monad is in essence just another way to write this in a neat form, make it composable and control the IO environment.<p>public IO<T> doSomeStuff(IO<T> input)<p>But you would not get this insight from any of the monad tutorials written by Haskell people (except the link above).

I have a stack of Panasonic Toughbooks that have a locked BIOS configuration, and absolutely nothing can be done with these machines (they were thrown away, stupidly) because nobody knows the password to re-configure them to boot properly.  The BIOS is completely locked down.<p>So, we will start to see this happen on a broader industry scale, and in my opinion the benefits of ""secure boot"" definitely do not outweigh the liability of making hardware that won't be useful in the future, simply because 'the OS it originally had on it was such utter shit to require such measures in the first place'..",1318928591

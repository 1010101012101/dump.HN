If I already know (or suspect) I have some illness, I would join this group just before I go in for expensive care, exploiting the risk-bearers.  Some ways to avoid this problem: phase in benefits, force full medical disclosure to you, be able to detect fraud.<p>One possible benefit: if geographically organized, the community could negotiate bulk discounts from local hospitals and doctors.  The business could make this mostly automatic -- grow your community, keep your community healthy => get better rates at the local docs.",1221723752

Speed has never been an issue for my particular application (relatively small scale online research) - and I've often just been using old fashioned CGI technology.<p>My only negative comment about the experience would be that I tend to accumulate some C extensions which take a little effort to deploy when you move servers.",1221723547

For example, the erosion of IEâ€™s dominance following the introduction of Firefox and others (although the barrier of IE being pre-loaded onto the majority of personal computers means this dominance will continue for some time).

You cannot put pressure on men not to have work-life balance and not to be the one looking after the kids without also pushing women into becoming the main carer for them, and likewise you can't lift that load from women without some way for the men to pick up the slack.<p>Sadly, what generally happens is that once activists for women's rights have categorised something as a men's issue, they stop caring about it. So you get articles like this one which never question the underlying assumption that women are the ones that need to compromise their careers in order to raise a family, and that men have no interest in doing so. The article talks about women being locked out of positions of power because of this - if we could change things and make it just as normal for men to put their career goals aside to raise kids, that'd have huge implications, but that's a men's issue and hence ignored.",1366754167

(""Opaque"" syncing of symlinks means to sync the links themselves and not what the symlinks link to.) I use symlinks heavily and so I absolutely require this feature. Most of the commercial solutions just ignore symlinks, but Dropbox does the worst thing possible and treats symlinks <i>transparently</i>. This is utterly wrong and, in fact, downright dangerous!<p>Another feature that I need for telecommuting software development is to be able to exclude artifacts from what is synced. Eclipse, for instance, constantly churns out artifacts, and I certainly don't want or need those artifacts to be synced.<p>Two problems with my roll-your-own little syncing system remain: (1) The large file issue that you mentioned. (Sparkleshare is much worse in this regard than my system, last I tried.) (2) I know of no way to have the Git instance that I use for syncing not pay attention to the .gitignore files that are used by the Git instance that I use for version control. Annoying!<p>In any case, I'm very glad to hear that BitTorrent seems to be coming up with a solution that will address all my issues, and I won't have to roll my own anymore.",1366753991

How do you distinguish between someone who felt empowered to make a choice and someone who was socialized to accede to others' needs first?<p>In general I'd probably be skeptical of someone who said that raising children was more fulfilling than any other pursuit, but what's more important than that is that there should be a choice in the first place.

You get a web-based view for your albums, you can share easier outside of your own devices, you can - as he says, compete with the top services for photo, video and music sharing. Cloud sync makes you a media company.<p>Personally, I use cloud sync for a lot of backup stuff. Granted, it's mostly Git to BitBucket, but in school I used to push documents to Dropbox or Box just to have a backup. I wasn't interested in having my essays synced to my phone, just that if my other versions died I could download my work again to another device.<p>If you're referring to companies though, no I doubt they'd want a seamless and perfect system in somebody else's data center.

Sometimes it helps determine a need for more headcount but beware the mythical man month.<p>2. The process of estimating also unearths project risk. How risky is a particular item? Well, humans also suck at estimating risk so it's hard to say. But at least the risks are stated openly and everyone knows about them.<p>3. Estimating makes many assumptions explicit. Or at the very least, they're often implied as ""large tasks"". This may or may not be the same as #2.<p>I'm not about to make any claims about magical methodologies that will work for every team everywhere and I don't have any Agile training to sell anyone but I think those two goals are worthy ones.

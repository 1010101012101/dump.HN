They do just fine not soaking people for their ancestors wealth.<p>Secondly, university costs are in a financial bubble, for the exact same reason as house prices in 2007. The bizarre funding schemes and underwriting are a temporary state of financial cprruption, not the natural order of things.<p>Thirdly, the free rider problem only applies to zero sum games. If FedGov stopped blackmailing parents, it would not be education that collapses, just the bureaucracy grown fat on the back of ill gotten money.<p>Fourthly, to the extent that higher education is a zero sum game, that problem is trivially solvable by funding it with taxes.

two years he knocked off one of Hilbert&#x27;s
problems, like Gleason did, then he
could also become a Harvard &#x27;Fellow&#x27;
and skip a Ph.D.!  But, again, we&#x27;re
talking engineering, not being so
advanced as a ugrad that really should
end up with a Ph.D. in math instead of a
Bachelor&#x27;s.<p>What&#x27;s so wrong about just taking the first
two years of college as just the
usual first two years?  A CC can 
provide that.  A CC can use a
good calculus book; when I took
calculus, I used the same book
Harvard used; that is, Harvard
was willing to teach a calculus
course, just calculus from just
a common book, to I don&#x27;t know
who took it.  Given the book
and anything like a competent CC teacher,
the Harvard course doesn&#x27;t have much
room to be better than a CC course,
especially if the student followed
my recommendations on self study before
the course.<p>I know; I know; maybe the freshman 
English lit course at Harvard is taught
by a Nobel prize winner in literature
and can provide some astoundingly profound
insights into Henry James and, thus,
change the lives of the students.  I&#x27;m
not impressed.<p>You seem eager to &quot;pay a lot&quot; for the first
two years of college.",1375950446

6177835,comment,6173757,6174383,6,0,vidarh,,,"My favourite example of memory allocation anti-patterns:<p>A decade or so ago I worked on a GUI and we needed a Type 1 font parser. Freetype was not a good fit to our (very memory constrained, slow) platform. I was suprised though, how slow the library was, and did some profiling. First thing I noticed was a huge number of malloc() calls. And  they were all small. A huge portion of them were only <i>4 bytes</i>. The malloc() implementation on our platform had an overhead of at least 12 bytes per allocation, so not only was it slow, it also wasted a ludicrous amount of memory.<p>All in all there were multiple allocations <i>per glyph</i> despite the fonts being loaded and unloaded as a single unit. Yikes.<p>Since we were in a rush, my hacky fix was a search/replace for malloc()/free() to special a special version of malloc that would just grab the next free chunk from a pool, or if the pool was full allocate another 4KB block and start allocating from that, and nothing for free, and then I added code to initialise the pool and free it to the open/close parts of the font API.<p>The result was drastically reduced memory usage and at least an order of magnitude speedup on our platform.<p>(The library in question was t1lib, a library originally released by Adobe, and the stupid memory handling is still in there as of today despite sporadic updates over the last decade; I guess it&#x27;s not used much any more with FreeType, but I&#x27;m almost tempted to do a cleaner fix and submit it - the fix we did was not suitable for general usage as it explicitly assumed a single set of fonts would be loaded and unloaded in the same order, as it didn&#x27;t keep pools per loaded font)",1375950368

I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with me writing my own--original--free ending to the free preview:<p>Those links mean that instead of communicating through Internet pipes run by ISPs, that communication is completely free. Further, any peer can connect with any other peer. So as peers join up, the network grows. Eventually if one peer in this cluster also has an Internet connection, then the network also does. Obviously bandwidth constraints limit infinitely sharing one ISP account with an arbitrary number of people. However, if that peer has purchased space within a data center, a cloud-hosted machine, then Internet access is realistic for those currently without access. In effect it not only allows nodes to connect, it allows any node to provide Internet.<p>So, the ultimate aim is not to replace the Internet. And it&#x27;s not to piggy back on the Internet. It&#x27;s simply to let computers communicate freely.<p>And part of free communication, in every sense of the word, is that communication must be encrypted. One node must be free to communicate directly to another without others listening. The idea of free speech is not merely to allow freely speaking to the public or a group, it&#x27;s to allow individuals to communicate amongst only each other, while at the same time not restricting them from communication to a wider audience should they choose.<p>The way this security is implemented is through IPv6. Each IP is associated with a public key and shared secret. It would be feasible to incorporate a negotiated secret. But as part of the initial phase, the idea is to test the core of the project: cjdns (on Github as <a href=""https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/</a>). This &quot;invite&quot; system, in effect, controls the spread of meshnet and limits the possibility for abuse of the network, since each member of a meshnet must share a secret to bring a new node in.<p>Plans are underway for rapid expansion of the meshnet. But careless growth is not possible, due to the current nature as a circle of trust, and importantly, the ability to de-peer malicious users.<p>This basic model of adding peers and sharing secrets is now being automated. And I&#x27;d tell you their specific plans, but that&#x27;s a secret. Pass it on.",1375950100

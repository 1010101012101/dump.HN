If you have the balls to submit an app with $15 billion, you're pretty likely to have the balls to try to get there. The IRL interview'll sort out whether you're crazy smart or crazy dumb.",1191904873

65132,comment,65081,65081,0,0,aschwo,,,"A web-based interface for building and managing shaders for 3D apps and renderers.  Features would include a node-based shader builder, plugins for the various 3D packages (Maya, Max, Houdini, XSI, etc), suppport for the various shading languages (RSL, VEX, mental ray, Cg, etc), and user groups and permissions.  Think sourceforge for 3D artists, small studios without the ability to roll their own management solutions would like this.<p>Workflow is like this:  user creates shader using node editor (think Maya's Hypershade, but Ajaxified...), then sets permissions for the shader.  Any user with permission to use the shader can see it from the plugin for his app of choice on his machine and use it.  The user sets the renderer that he wants to use, the shader is compiled on the server and sent down the pipe to the user.  That way, source code is kept in the hands of the people who created it.  Scene renders.<p>I would love to build something like this, but it requires a lot more CS knowledge than I have.  So if you think it's cool, roll with it and invite me to the private beta.",1191904618

So say I receive an email about a new bug, I could just jot down more details into another layer on top that email in transparent font/colour. I've noticed other people often print out emails and do something like this with a red marker. <p>I use Thunderbird and I've thought about digging around in the source to see if this is possible. It's not something I've found time to do though.",1191903002

I'm thinking separate login and application servers, as well as load balancing for the back end. <p>Is anything in particular well suited for this? The two languages I was initially planning on choosing between were C++ and Java, although obviously I wouldn't be bound to one language for the entire project. Or is there some kind of framework designed with something like that in mind?",1191902520

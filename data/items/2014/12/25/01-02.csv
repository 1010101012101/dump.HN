Every scientist is working out of fear and therefore is doing the minimal amount possible to not be scolded.  I lived in a communist country and the same way the economy was in the hole, so was scientific advancement.  A good analogy is Cuba- they have one of the most rigorous schools for becoming a doctor, but they wouldn&#x27;t know how to operate an MRI since none exist in the country.  An NK citizen may have taken security class at an university, but may not have the talent, like a logical anarchist, required to become a great hacker.  The number of skilled, motivated hackers outside NK is greater than those inside.  Look at the video-how do you find the 10x programmer in that computer lab?<p>NK&#x27;s way of keeping 24M people from protesting is by controlling INFORMATION.  To have a hacker untraceable and talented enough to enter SONY, they must be read on the latest trends.  This same hacker, if informed, would be smart enough to google his way out of the horrible living conditions in NK.  The nuke scientists copied 1950&#x27;s tech.<p>To me this sounds like the WMD&#x27;s of the early 2000&#x27;s.  If NK doesn&#x27;t have any credibility they will be easily blamed for political leverage with no evidence.<p>I welcome the FBI to open source the malware, traffic and trace logs for community analysis.<p>Come back and read this comment when hackers acquire this data themselves and provide technical proof of NK NOT being at fault.",1419472790
8795178,comment,8795037,8795064,0,0,yazaddaruvala,,,"So for me.. &quot;Engineer&quot; is actually different. Honestly I think they are all different however I&#x27;m especially fond of engineer and care to differentiate it.<p>In my opinion an Engineer is a problem solver, at scale. Similar to a Contractor vs Civil Engineer. Sure a contractor can build you a good bridge for your backyard but you don&#x27;t get them to design you the Golden Gate.<p>Similarly you don&#x27;t build DynamoDB or BigTable with programmers, in my opinion you need Engineers.<p>Outside of analogy, the biggest difference I can think of is probably the ease at which youre able to be taught new things and the breath of knowledge that they already have. An engineer, at least in my experience/opinion has more breath of knowledge and a far easier time teaching themselves new things than a programmer. However, some programmers actually have more knowledge about a specific topic. For example I couldn&#x27;t currently profile a running JVM (I&#x27;m sure I could learn) but to someone taught to program in Java and specifically took classes on Java, it is second nature. Again similar to how a civil engineer couldn&#x27;t build you a closet. Or mechanical engineer couldn&#x27;t fix your Honda Civic.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m just being a bit defensive since I had to go through 1 year of general engineering (physics/chemistry/project management) 1 year of electrical engineering and 2 years of computer engineering.<p><i></i>For the record, I don&#x27;t think you need to have gone to university to be an engineer. That was just my motivation for segregating its definition as much as I could.",1419472618

8795161,comment,8794695,8795112,0,0,kcoul,,,"I agree. The emerging field of data science can help us to make more sense of the patterns and lack thereof that can become apparent after high fidelity capture of our brainwaves.<p>On that note, I would have to say I was a bit disappointed by the Neurosky Mindwave Mobile unit I received - despite being able to bypass their simplified attention/meditation/blinking reduction of the raw input signals and capture the {delta, theta, ..., gamma} filtered bands for further processing, many people (myself included) complained about the apparently low quality of the data, specifically showing large amounts of delta band activity and little else. I resigned that the low-cost interface was simplified to the point where it was a novelty and little else.<p>Now I am narrowing it down to OpenBCI vs. Muse vs Emotiv. Picking the right one for the handful of projects I want to use an EEG for is proving to be difficult. I&#x27;m simultaneously attracted to the ability to take matters more into my own hands with OpenBCI, and the ability to just get started right away with a product like Muse or EPOC.<p>I&#x27;m curious if you were planning to use the Rift for photic entrainment. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else intending to get into photic stimulation with the Rift besides a project or two that never seemed to take off like Ocunaut, so if you do plan to, it would be great to collaborate somehow.<p>Some research has indicated that photic entrainment might be even more effective than the various kinds of aural entrainment (binaural, monaural, isochronic).<p><a href=""http://www.mindalive.com/articleone.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mindalive.com/articleone.htm</a>\n(1/3rd of the way down, Frederick, Lubar, Rasey, Brim, &  Blackburn, 1999)<p>My impressions from that study are that eyes-closed photic-only worked best for two reasons:<p>1. Closing the eyelids blocks out extraneous light which reduces interference.\n2. No one knew how to properly combine the entrainment modalities yet.<p>However I believe that if a proper theoretical model is applied, AVE techniques might then become more effective, perhaps even more so if tactile audio were involved as well.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio-visual_entrainment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio-visual_entrainment</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_sound"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_sound</a><p>To me, a unit like the DK1 is not really usable for anything besides this sort of thing. After all, panning anywhere nearly as quickly as would be needed in a game on a DK1 would get most nauseated fairly quickly. (The DK2 is much better in this regard, and Crystal Cove hopefully even more so)<p>But the one saving grace for the DK1 was things done very slowly and deliberately, like a relaxed exploration of the Tuscany demo or something like this: <a href=""http://guidedmeditationvr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guidedmeditationvr.com/</a>",1419472179

First, navigable rivers by definition service twice the land area of a coastline (rivers have two banks, coasts only one). Second, rivers are not subject to tidal forces, greatly easing the construction and maintenance of supporting infrastructure. Third, storm surges often accompany oceanic storms, which force the evacuation of oceanic ports. None of this eliminates the usefulness of coastal ports, but in terms of the capacity to generate capital, coastal regions are a poor second compared to lands with navigable rivers.&quot;<p>This is just after explaining all the economic benefits to a river system like that of the Mississippi. I am just wondering now about the time after which the ice caps have receded and the river system in question occupies more land; would it be wrong to think that this could possibly increase its potential economic output?",1419471841

They teach 3,000 characters, which is numerically even more than the 1,800 characters taught in South Korea in school. But as you said, in North Korea you don&#x27;t even see the very limited usage of Chinese characters in newspapers that you see in South Korea, so it is not much beyond a subject you learn in school. You could say the same about the situation in South Korea, though, since the usage of Chinese characters is really, really limited, mostly to certain newspapers.<p>The notion that North Koreans say 얼음보숭이 (ŏrumbosung&#x27;i) for &quot;ice cream&quot; is a bit of a myth. The authorities in North Korea did indeed introduce this word as a part of a linguistic purification effort, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to have caught on. A 1962 North Korean dictionary only has 아이스크림 (aisŭk&#x27;ŭrim) &quot;ice cream&quot;, just as in South Korea. A 1981 edition of another dictionary and a 1984 encyclopedia introduce 얼음보숭이 (ŏrumbosung&#x27;i), but the official dictionary that appeared in 1992 again has 아이스크림 (aisŭk&#x27;ŭrim) &quot;ice cream&quot; and not 얼음보숭이 (ŏrumbosung&#x27;i). The 1992 dictionary also has 에스키모 (esŭk&#x27;imo) &quot;eskimo&quot;, which in North Korea is a popular everyday word for &quot;ice cream&quot; which comes from a name of a brand that was popular there.<p>You have plenty of examples of South Korean language authorities introducing &quot;purified&quot; (often pure Korean) words to replace loanwords, which don&#x27;t necessarily catch on.

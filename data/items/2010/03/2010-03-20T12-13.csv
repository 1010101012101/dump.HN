Suddenly 130 million dollars for On2 doesn't seem that bad an investment.<p>(Obviously Apple <i>could</i> adopt a royalty free format, but would they unless forced to?)",1269089907
1206355,comment,1206035,1206279,0,0,andrewcooke,,,"yes, that's the only way it could help (encrypting the whole thing), and then not only do you have the problem of not being able to see the data, you also have an efficiency issue (which, even in some future state where this is improved enough to be usable, is still going to be a real drag).<p>i was thinking that somehow encrypting each piece of data individually would help, but the kind of processing netflix requires (and the kind that make it possible to extract data based on statistical properties) isn't doing calculations with the values, but doing statistical processing of the tokens (which is why only equality is needed, really).  so encryption of individual items doesn't change much.",1269089860

The headache of managing bought content in terms of backups, syncing to various devices, changing formats, essentially making everyone a expert in storage management is one that could use some creative destruction.<p>I already got rid of my collection of music videos in favour of youtube playlists, movie collection in favour of a netflix subscription, document store for Google docs and would dearly love to get rid of my mp3 collection in favour of a streaming service. Spotify et al cant get here soon enough for me. Once that happens I wont be in perpetual fear of my laptop breaking down (just replace with another netbook) or losing my various cd/dvd/flash-drive backups.
If one day I'm not able to afford these services or a net connection, I have bigger issues to worry about than being able to enjoy the movies/music.<p>This stuff is not rare enough to make it worth me owning a copy (unlike in the 90s or before)",1269089655

1206348,comment,1205527,1205569,0,0,chr15,,,"You must already have a clearance, or the OP's company must be willing to pay thousands of dollars for you to get one. A TS clearance is not something that can simply be applied for. Yes, you fill out the SF86 (for a TS clearance), but your clearance must be sponsored by your current employer or your to-be employer.  You cannot fill out the SF86 and mail it in expecting to get a clearance without a sponsoring organization.<p>TS clearances require a rigorous background investigation on the applicant and sometimes require 1 or more polygraphs. The entire investigation/adjudication process can take up to a year or more. The intelligence community that will adjudicate you is trying to determine whether or not you are a risk to the country if you are given classified information.<p>Clearances are very difficult to get, and people are often disqualified because they have poor credit history or have lied on their SF86 (especially about drug use).  This is why people that hold a clearance command a premium on their salary. Current figures are that TS-cleared individuals make up to $15K more than their non-cleared counterparts.",1269089212

No big feats to brag about here, but I'll join the game anyway :-)<p>* started my first 'gig' translating books/magazines, printing them in a borrowed dot-matrix printer and selling around the town (at age 9).

No harm done, but it was fun fun fun<p>* founded and leaded a programming 'association' (PBJug, a Java User Group) - the first one in my hometown's region (now with 500 people signed up)<p>* got a couple of articles published as reference material on PhD and Msc thesis of people I don't even know. I'm a college dropout, btw<p>* had access to a lot of prototype mobile phones from two different makers.

one customer.

1206343,comment,1205163,1205365,0,0,DougBTX,,,"Using an abstraction which increases the total amount of code could be worthwhile if it makes the difficult parts of your code simpler.<p>Pulling an example out of thin air, shorter total code:<p><pre><code>    var counter = 0;

    function foo() {
        log(""Incremented"");
        counter++;
    }

    function bar() {
        log(""Incremented"");
        counter++;
    }

</code></pre>
Code with an abstraction which makes foo and bar shorter:<p><pre><code>    var counter = 0;
    
    function increment() {
        log(""Incremented"");
        counter++;
    }
    
    function foo() {
        increment();
    }

    function bar() {
        increment();
    }
</code></pre>
Even longer code, but which encapsulates the counter variable, possibly making it easier to reason about:<p><pre><code>    var Counter = (function ()
    {
        var counter = 0;

        return {
            increment : function() {
                log(""Incremented"");
                counter++;
            },
            current : function() {
                return counter;
            }
        };
    });

    function foo() {
        Counter.increment();
    }

    function bar() {
        Counter.increment();

One of the major problems in financial markets is that if you've got a large position you need to buy/sell you can't just put an order out in the market because you'll move the market price.<p>One of the more popular ways of solving this at the moment is through the use of ""dark pools"", third parties who will match up counterparties anonymously who want to do large trades in opposite directions. However this isn't ideal because going to a third party introduces latency and complexity with credit checking, etc.<p>If you could have some way of allowing firms to place orders with each other directly without exposing the details of the orders, it would have a major impact.",1269088290

More to the point, would everyone do something good with the free time?  Certainly not, but that's OK as long as there are limits on the negative externalalties (sp?) of that free time (e.g. our version of Rome's ""bread and circuses"" is atomizing, most people watch sports on TV, at home or perhaps in relatively small groups at sports bars, and we do a pretty good job of maintaining order in our stadiums (compare to  soccer in the U.K.)).",1269087568

788982,comment,788856,788856,0,0,Nervetattoo,,,"I'm amazed as well that it went that well.
And its really great to hear that they weren't put off, lets hope the coming generation can help improve the genre ratio within programming workplaces.
I like you approach, and choosing shoes probably was a good choice. Instant gratification should be #1 goal in classes like this, its all about building excitement, which it seems you nailed.<p>""Another girl dug into the documentation she had seen me use, and figured out how to use the color picker to let the user select a color for the line!"" 
I'm impressed. Figuring out manuals can at times be hard even for us who use them on a day-to-day basis.",1251370651
788981,comment,788377,788711,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Also, you also seem to be implying that people should only be interested in making huge amounts of money. That it's a bad thing to become a doctor or a lawyer because it places a ceiling on how much money you can make.<p>I ought to be more eloquent - though I've been under the impression that a lot of people do become doctors and lawyers for the mix of prestige and money. Many lawyers love the law - but many go in because it is a high paying field. Yet, there are better paths to wealth than law. That's why I wanted people to come and discuss - there's young readers here, they ought to consider that if they'd like to be wealthy, university may not be the best path.<p>> Most people would rather do a job the enjoy and make a decent amount of money rather than doing a job they hate and making enormous amounts of money.<p>This is such a false dichotomy. You can have both - really. You can find an intersection of doing something you enjoy and making enormous amounts of money. It's such a brutally bad false dichotomy - choose between hatred/enormous money or enjoyable/decent money, and a lot of people are poorer or lead less enjoyable lives because they don't fight it. It's a societal cliche, but it is false. That's worth pondering.",1251370617

788975,comment,788816,788915,0,0,almost,,,"That's what shell scripts do in general, they automate things you could have done yourself with a bit more typing. With a todo list I feel it is absolutely vital that there is as little friction as possible. You don't want the process of recording and tracking what you have to do to distract you from actually doing it!<p>Plus how long would it take <i>you</i> to accidentally type ""echo blah > todo.txt"" instead of ""echo blah >> todo.txt"". I'm thinking a few days for me :)<p>This is all academic of course, everyone should be using org-mode for todo lists. What do you mean you don't have Emacs running all the time?? ;)",1251370152

We’ve also tried websites such as http://www.supply2.gov.uk/ but I’ve found these to be of limited use. Getting clients at this stage is critical to us as we need to increase our portfolio of work.<p>My question is for those that do web development for a similar audience; where do you look for potential clients, RFPs etc? Do you hit the streets? Hold workshops? Attend ‘networking’ events? Search online?<p>Note that I am based in London - although it would also be interesting to know how this works internationally.

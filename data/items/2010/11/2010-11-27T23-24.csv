1946210,comment,1945282,1945823,0,0,jrockway,,,"What are you talking about?  That is nothing like the topic of the article or what the parent comment is talking about.<p>Many Common Lisp runtimes compile things that you ""eval"" into native machine code when the eval statement runs.  That is what the parent is referring to.<p>Many other languages have different ""phases"" of compilation.  An example is Perl 5's BEGIN, which is Perl code that runs at compile time.  This means you can write Perl to affect the compilation of the Perl program.<p>(Why would you do this?  Here's an example. When loading the module List::Util, you want to be able to use its ""first"" function as though it was declared in your module.  You can do this because List::Util can run some code at <i>compile-time</i> that installs the ""first"" subroutine into your namespace.  Then as compilation (and runtime) continues, you will magically have that ""first"" subroutine in your namespace, and the program will compile properly.<p>If there was no ability to run code at compile time, then importing stuff from a module into the caller would have to be a language feature.  Making the action of running code at compile time (and installing subroutines at runtime) makes it possible to implement this without help from the language author.)",1290902214
1946209,comment,1945908,1945908,0,0,viraptor,,,"I'm confused by this article for a couple of reasons:<p>- There is ZRTP, SRTP, SIP over TLS and many proprietary systems. Why add yet another one?<p>- Right now, adding a new extensions to what providers offer is extremely tricky - unless you have a massive number of customers who support / want it. Basically it's easier to add a new VPN connection on top of all the traffic to some site, rather than adding support for feature X (especially if your infrastructure is a mix&match of many solutions)<p>- I don't know the amount of standard trapezoid-type SIP connections on the internet these days - but I assume it's very low. If you have a local server with some serious usage, it will be a PBX and not a proxy. If it's a VPBX provider on the internet, it's most probably a PBX not a proxy. This (for many reasons) means that any encoding you can get is only between you and the provider. There, you lose the control over what's happening.<p>- ""Identity"" in SIP networks is a completely different concept than email ""identity"". Calling a sip uri, you might end up on a sip client, pstn phone, voicemail, redirection to someone else, or any crazy automated service you can imagine. I don't see this being addressed in the article. With user-controlled e.164 directory you may end up on someone's door intercom for all you know.<p>In reality my recommendation is - You want your call secure? Use your own network only. - You want your PSTN call secure? Forget about it - any serious provider is expected by local laws to provide means for wiretapping, so your call will have to be decoded. The best thing you can do is vpn/tls to your provider. Basically I disagree that the phone call security is something that can be solved by adding features to sip, rtp or other protocols...",1290902192

After all, government is not in the content-production-for-profit business, and legislation like the DMCA is designed to benefit established publishers and manufacturers whose business model is threatened by unlicensed distribution.<p>So we might as well ask what is the fundamental problem with business, that makes it preferable to enlist law enforcement in defense of its interests than to do well by offering consumers a value they can't get from content piracy? I think there is some merit to the argument that leaders in the content industry have bought off political interests, but if they were somehow restricted from doing so, wouldn't that be a violation of free speech too?

You paid to rent it for a finite period under certain conditions, and signed a contract to that effect. the same is usually the case where software is concerned, but since you don't like the terms of the software contract too much, you feel free to ignore it, and redefine your licensing of the software as a purchase, granting yourself all kinds of new rights which the original creator never intended to give to end users. Now, you're welcome to say that software is way overpriced or those terms are so onerous you refuse to comply with them, a point of view I have some sympathy with. But at least be honest about the fact that you're choosing to ignore the contractual terms offered by the licensor and agreed to by the licensee.<p>edit: I don't mind being downvoted, but at least point out why you think the argument is flawed.

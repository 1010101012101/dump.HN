Do you both work through the same recruiter?<p>Any number of variables could lead to the discrepancy. You're likely being offered positions on different teams with different budgets. As crappy as it sounds, salary offers are often based more on budget than relative worth.<p>Within a given company, there can be a wide range of recruitment approaches. One recruiter may expect you to haggle more than another. My advice for first-time job seekers is to do one, at most two offer-counter-offer rounds. Remember that in these kinds of negotiations, the relationship is more important than the particular outcome. Being hated on day 1 sucks.",1239818160

563847,comment,563732,563732,0,0,rarestnews,,,"I don't really work with SQLite too much (I mainly work with mySQL and in-memory-structures, like hashes), but here are a few observations that kept me from using it:<p>1. It uses a lot of IO unnecessarily. (Actually, necessarily, due to their motto, but 99% odf developers aren't aware that this is not necessary) SQLite-based applications often make my hard-drive sqeak like it's on a last spin - SQLite does A LOT of hdd activity (Chrome, Firefox, Adwords editor are notorious for that). It's SQLites motto - 100% consistency first! journal everything!.. but... that's my HDD and I don't want it to be dead because SQLite thinks it's great idea to write every byte it receives to insure me against 0.01% chance of data loss.<p>2. Head-to-head runs of mySQL vs SQLite in real-world applications - well, SQLite loses badly.. and I mean badly. I use a lot of hash-style databases (i.e. id-value storage, 2 columns only) in some of my tests SQLite lost with 10 times worse performance against mySQL (again, if they didn't try to record everything, like mySQL does with MyISAM - they would've got the chance).<p>That being said - in-memory SQLite tables are very performant! Very! But... almost nobody uses that. As a result - Chrome/Firefox downloads phising update and my HDD lights like a christmas tree (download Filemon from SysInternals and watch how much Chrome or other SQLite-based engine uses your HDD for simple data that MUST be in-memory... or at least used by in-memory cache, like in MySQL... so your users' HDDs will eventually die because of this). I know it's none of developers troubles to think about the fact that their software unnecessarily uses much IO and leads to early hard drive replacement, but still, that's a big reason why I avoid using SQLite.<p>I mean, there are a lot of in-memory structures that can (and should) be used, but once the developer sees how convinient SQLite is, he jumps right on it. I mean.. 99% of times SQLite should be used like this - load data from disk to :memory: table (i.e. replicate it to memory), work with :memory: and eventually dump it to drive (like once in a couple of minutes) and dump on ""Save"" command. But instead every popular program uses disk-based tables. Why? Because it's a lazy way. Who wants to add in-memory pre-caching when you can just open a table from disk in less commands?<p>It's sad to see the current state of programming. Coming from an area where I had to write programs that would fit into 64KILObytes of memory and 3.5MHZ (that's 1000 times slower than modern single-core processor) - (ZX Spectrum)... and we've had whole huge games in that, working in real-time, with color graphics and almost unlimited galaxies (Elite)... it's just sad to see how the available resources are used these days. People had to use a lot of tricks to make things work with acceptable speeds... And now? I mean it's 3GHZ and gigabytes of data, yet I have to wait 10 seconds for Word (or Firefox) to start up?<p>My main points are: 1) SQLite is convinient; 2) Disk-based SQLite (which is used by 99% or more pieces of software) is nowhere near the possible performance of in-memory; 3) disk-based SQLite is putting a heck of a load on HDD (fire up FileMon during your Chrome session and be amazed); 4) SQLite is nowhere near one-fits-almost-all solution, like mp3 is; 5) even so it will gain more popularity because it's convenient for developers.<p>I have MySQL table with 72billion denormalized items (72million rows) and it's in realtime application... and it performs! I can't even imagine what would SQLite be like with that kind of data.<p>Still, please note that I'm not saying SQLite is bad, I'm saying the default route almost all devleopers take with it has some serious issues and yet nobody seems to care.",1239817851

This won't put you at the same level as you friend, but take comfort in the fact that he'll be axed before you. At 6 months, quit if you're getting crappy assignments, not learning anything, or otherwise being underestimated; if you're getting good projects and doing good work, negotiate another 15% raise at the end of the year, and another 15% at the end of the year after that, closing the discrepancy.<p>Do not mention the discrepancy to them.

When the donor is aware of the recipient's identity, but the recipient is unaware of the source.<p>2. When the donor and recipient are unknown to each other.<p>1.

Tax payers will subsidise some of the costs and Google will undoubtedly analyse the traffic to deliver yet even more personalised advertising. The local government will subsidise parts of the installation and make it legally as smooth as possible.""<p>As much as I agree with you, this quote highlights something that cycles through my mind whenever I read about Google's ambitions. Basically, Google is doing and motivating people to do what our government should (and as we read, apparently somewhat <i>can</i> in some ways) do to improve our communications infrastructure. It annoys me to think that we could simply be building a new (potentially more neutral) fiber ""highway"" across the country with a similar model, run by the government. If only people weren't so afraid of government and hell bent on handing things off to private sector instead of the public sector. It's disappointing, and I feel in the very long run it could very well backfire on all of us if google succeeds and becomes the next AT&T.",1347065850

4491854,comment,4491554,4491554,68,0,ChuckMcM,,,"During my tenure at NetApp I got to see all sorts of really really interesting disk problems and the lengths software had to go to reliably store data on them. Two scars burned into me from that were 1) disks suck, and 2) disks are not 'storage'.<p>The first part is pretty easy to understand, storage manufacturers have competed for years in a commodity market where consumers often choose price per gigabyte over URER (the unrecoverable read error rate), further at the scale of the market small savings of cents adds up to better margins. And while the 'enterprise' fibre channel and SCSI drives could (and did) command a hefty premium, the shift to SATA drives really put a crimp in the over all margin picture. So the disk manufacturers are stuck between the reliability of the drive and the cost of the drive. They surf the curve where it is just reliable enough to keep people buying drives.<p>This trend bites back, making the likely hood of an error while reading more and more probable. Not picking on Seagate here, they are all similar, but lets look at their Barracuda drive's spec sheet [1]. You will notice a parameter 'Nonrecoverable Read Errors per Bits read', and you'll see that its 1x10e14 across the sheet, from 3TB down to 250GB. It is a statistical thing, the whole magnetic field domain to digital bit pipeline is one giant analog loop of a error extraction. 1x10E14 <i>bits</i>. So what does that mean? Lets say each byte is encoded in 10 bits on the disk. Three trillion bytes is 30 trillion bits in that case, or 3x10E13 bits. Best case, if you read that disk from one end to the other (like you were re-silvering a mirror from a RAID 10 setup) you have a 1 in 3 chance that one of those sectors won't be readable <i>for a perfectly working disk.</i> Amazing isn't it? Trying to reconstruct a RAID5 group with 4 disks remaining out of 5, look out.<p>So physics is not on your side, but we've got RAID 6 Chuck! Of course you do, and that is a good thing. But what about when you write to the disk, the disk replies ""Yeah sure boss! Got that on the platters now"" but it didn't actually right it? Now you've got a parity failure waiting to bite you sitting on the drive, or worse, it <i>does</i> write the sector but writes it somewhere else (saw this a number of times at NetApp as well). There are <i>three million lines of code</i> in the disk firmware. One of the manufacturers (my memory says Maxtor) showed a demo where they booted Linux on the controller of the drive.<p>Bottom line is that the system works mostly, which is a huge win, and a lot of people blame the OS when the drive is at fault, another bonus for manufacturers, but unless your data is in a RAID 6 group or on at least 3 drives, its not really 'safe' in the ""I am absolutely positive I could read this back"" sense of the word.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.seagate.com/files/staticfiles/docs/pdf/datasheet/disc/barracuda-ds1737-1-1111us.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seagate.com/files/staticfiles/docs/pdf/datasheet/...</a>",1347065506

4491841,comment,4491274,4491695,1,0,KevinEldon,,,"I agree, and I think Google could have more in mind then just replacing television providers (no small feat). They can start to eliminate television channels. Why must NBC, CBS, or ESPN exist? If Google did ""adwords"" for television they just allow producers to release a show and then Google injects per-user targeted ads. Google's choice of a tablet as a remote hints at more interactive TV, not just big 30-second commercials, but opportunities to buy, learn, tag, etc. while you're watching a show. It gives producers more control over their content and an opportunity to look at different ways to fund the show's production. Forget 30 minutes show slots... do 48, or 10, or whatever makes sense.<p>Sure, it probably means more ads, but it could mean more innovative, targeted, and available content too.",1347065131

If the public and the police are not in a 'fair fight' so to speak, this is a problem and should be taken up.  We just need to frame the problem. Properly though, so it makes sense.<p>Right now, it does seem pretty <i>unreasonable</i> to expect citizens to line their house with lead shielding, for example, to keep from being visually intruded upon.  Because the cost and complexity, if nothing else.<p>The wi-fi example is more tricky, because of a couple areas.  You are technically using unlicensed public spectrum in 2.5ghz.  You can secure it (somewhat) with simple, lo-cost steps, etc. Its broadcasting signal beyond your propert lines, etc.<p>Now, what about 3G datacard?  Thats protected because not only is it encrypted but its a 1 to 1 telco connect which requies a warrant. 1 to 1 calls are not exempt from warrant requirements. are on private spectrum. and because 1 to 1 their is no broadcast element.  etc. Even though this too is lookingh alot like wi-fi in a diagram (radio, spectrum, mobile etc)<p>So, these are some things in the context that are relevant.  Generally, if the authorities have <i>007</i> technology that we cannot see, hear, smell, detect or ever reasonably avoid, then we have a major problem.

Do you have full control of both ends, or only the server?  Are you streaming or is the whole file always transferred?  Do you need encryption?<p>For simultaneous large files with no special needs, my instinct would be to just choose any lightweight HTTP server that supports sendfile().

But when you are running a dozen apps with completely different functionality, but all of them are fairly simplistic, a touch-screen (especially a good one) does a better job on average, as compared to a keyboard where you quickly descend into the buttons being meaningless ala Nokia endless 2-button menu navigation.<p>Now obviously you can have both (I bought a G1 back in '08 and I like having both), but it took balls for Apple to make that decision and say that a touchscreen <i>only</i> would be sufficient.  However the impact of that decision on the elegance of the form factor is undeniable, and something that I imagine had a large if unmeasurable impact on the success of the iPhone.

All his critiques are obvious issues that Apple was probably thinking about from day 1 of product design in 2005 or whenever.  Buttons too small for touchscreen; make them bigger.  No tactile feedback; make the UI super-responsive.<p>On the other hand you can cut the guy some slack since he made these predictions before release.

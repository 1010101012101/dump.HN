4768835,comment,4767789,4768753,4,0,eropple,,,"<i>How cool would that be, your files are in iCloud so you know they are safe</i><p>My open-source stuff is on Github, sure, but none of my private code is. I run a Redmine+gitolite instance on a physical box in my house for my private and private collaborative projects (one on-site backup, taken daily and rolled over three days; one off-site backup, stored every week). My code stays local and on machines I control, and the same is the case for many other businesses. It's for that reason that I don't think what you're describing is likely to be so commonplace as to make local development ""fall by the wayside"" in the near future.<p>While I get where you're going, I admit I had to restrain an eye-roll at the idea that this will be ""the thing"" anytime soon if only due to inertia. A development environment for Android in the cloud would be ""cool,"" <i>until it breaks</i>. I have a very overpowering need to control my toolchain and my environment and that doesn't mesh with what you describe. I find the situation you are describing to feel <i>really fucking oppressive</i>. Unsettlingly so.<p>(I don't see Apple locking down the Mac, by the way. I see Mac sales being cannibalized by iPads, but I do not see Apple, at least in the near future, killing its most attractive feature--flexibility. Both for developers and for consumers. I think Microsoft has a much better chance of offing the traditional desktop/laptop with WinRT, though I'm personally not a fan.)<p>.<p>I fully agree that something similar will eventually happen for a certain subset of development; there are certainly some developers to whom this no doubt sounds really awesome. But I think that, and I don't say this to be either insulting or patronizing, this may be a bit of projection on your part. This feels like a ""Valley bubble"" idea, a ""wouldn't it be cool if"" that ignores a lot of real-world use-cases. Even aside from the ""ew, remote"" factor for me personally, I think there are enough infrastructural hurdles to make this really difficult to do in the sort of timeframe you're suggesting.<p>But I am not the target market for such things anyway. I find ""always-on"" technology overwhelming. I find that my best development time is when I turn off the Internet and go sit outside and write code; I keep local copies of the Python manual, the Java APIs, and the MSDN library for that reason. (And my Mac is silent when I'm doing development work, FWIW.)<p>Perhaps I am wishcasting, but I don't think so. Here's hoping you're wrong. =)",1352613016

4768830,comment,4768789,4768789,22,0,luu,,,"Many years ago, I applied for a Google job that I was totally unqualified for. I didn't even get an interview, but they sent me a nice <i>snail mail</i> paper rejection letter anyway. I've heard mixed things about their interview process, but I still get a have a nebulous warm fuzzy feeling when I think about possibly sending a resume in again one day, because of one simple, probably automated, $.29[1] response.<p>Conversely, at a company I won't publicly name, I got the silent treatment [2], <i>after getting an offer</i>, for asking if I could take two months off between jobs. I can only imagine what would have happened if I tried to negotiate salary.<p>I understand and appreciate the blogger's comment that people should behave decently, by the simple virtue of being human. But, that's not going to convince anyone who doesn't already want to be a decent person. But what ever happened to unenlightened self-interest, naked greed, and pure avarice? Not only did they sour me on the company, they lost two other potential hires into the same group, when I told them how their potential future boss treated me when I didn't take the offer without negotiating, after being asked why I didn't take the job.<p>There's pretty much no benefit to treating people shoddily, and a huge potential downside, when the candidate pool you're trying to employ hears about it. Why do it?<p>[1] Probably less, since they doubtless qualify for bulk mail rates.<p>[2] I sent a couple of emails to follow-up, and tried calling and leaving a voicemail once. I had the hiring manager's number (and that's the person I would have been directly reporting to), because he gave it to me in case I had any questions. Months later, I asked a friend of mine at the company what happened, and he told me ""Yeah, X is pretty  busy"". The funny thing is, it was a huge microprocessor project that was staffing about 40 circuit designers / logic implementers, and the hiring manager told me they were expecting to continue hiring for another six months. It actually took them longer than that to fill all the positions they wanted, and I would have started before they were finished with the arch/perf simulations and moved onto real logic work anyway, even with a two month delay. I would have saved them paying me two months salary without having any work for me to do!<p>EDIT: Sorry for adding something after there have been replies, but it's been a long time since this happened. After looking through old emails to jog my memory, I see that they sent me a standard form with a bunch of info they wanted filled out, before I interviewed. One of the fields was availability, which I listed as 2+ months out. It's a big bureaucratic company, so it's understandable that there are standard forms which get sent out that hiring managers never look at, but ignoring this particular thing this particular time is a bit funny, ex post.",1352612752

<a href=""http://www.iter.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iter.org/</a><p>One of my professors from college moonlights as a consultant for the project.<p>What most people don't acknowledge about the ""30 years away"" joke is the type of environments in which the statement was made.  In the 1950's the confidence was rooted in naivete (similar statements were made about making artificial life), but in the 1970's the confidence was rooted in economics.  The fuel crises led to substantially increased funding in alternative energy sources.<p>Much lamented by my professor from college, as oil prices dropped back down so did research funding for fusion reactors (although given that the bulk of electricity in this country comes from coal, nuclear, natural gas, and to a lesser extent hydro I'm not clear why that would've been the case, maybe we were running more extensively on fuel oil back then).<p>If ITER proves promising (beyond energy break even) another facility will have to be constructed that will be more expensive and will take longer to construct, this facility will prove promising only if it indicates potential for economic break even (I think it has to put out >7x the input energy).  If that can be accomplished then there's still a few material challenges (neutron bombardment has a tendency to make metals brittle, the appropriate containment chamber materials aren't even a glimmer in a material scientists eyes yet as well as the radioactivity issue (the entire plant will gradually become more radioactive).<p>If this kid built a fusor he clearly has a great deal of potential, while I'm skeptical that he can make a difference alone I wouldn't be surprised if he could offer contributions to the current projects underway to advance this field.  Plasma magnetohydrodynamics has so few people that understand it that every additional mind has potential to make a difference.",1352612215

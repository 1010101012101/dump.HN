One of the biggest offenders is its complete unwillingness to ever shrink the system allocated memory, even if the heap is 95% empty. For instance, if your application has a huge peak allocation period (whether your fault or an issue with soft references sticking about when you really don't want them), it will put memory pressure on the OS for the rest of its (process) life. If the JVM has an option of garbage collecting large amounts of objects or growing the heap, it generally prefers growing the heap. You can run quite a few Java applications with amazingly small heaps at everything will be fine (except for performance due to GC overhead).<p>The abstraction breaker here is that your application often has a set of ideal GC settings, which need to be set.

3232736,comment,3232603,3232603,5,0,narrator,,,"Yes, Java uses a lot of memory.  It uses a lot of memory mostly because it doesn't mmap static shared lib files. Most c library based systems (e.g PHP, Python, Ruby) do.  When the system can mmap read only shared lib files, that uses a lot less memory because multiple processes can share them and they are only read in to memory as they are accessed thanks to the page fault mechanism of 386 protected-mode architecture.<p>Java can't do this because Java self-modifies code (JIT) to run faster while it's running.  Once all your classes are loaded into ram though, the memory gets consumed at a much more leisurely pace.  However, multiple apps can't reuse each other's already mapped into memory code like they can with PHP, etc.  As far as appserver restarts, just pay the money for JRebel already and quit complaining.

The fact is memory <i>is</i> cheap these days and the convenience of the JVM is something thats tough to overlook.

I can run multiple processes on the same JVM instance and stay within reasonable memory bounds.<p>Also, we need to consider the alternative.  Where would we go if we didnt have the JVM?  Its not like .Net is much better in this regard.  We could go without a system as heavyweight as these two but then we lose all the advantages that come along with that weight.<p>Certainly, those advantages are <i>not</i> needed for a lot of purposes.

I feel like I can just get stuff done.<p>But then I try to work, and things just fail... A lack of common UI controls (Cocoa, OS X's killer feature) drives me insane when ctrl+a won't work, or a text field won't spell check for me, or I can't right click a word and get the definition of the word.<p>I find this is my problem with the iPhone as well. I got the iPhone 4 and 4S when they first came out as they are my best option out there, but I hate them so much. Other platforms are doing much more interesting things, such as Windows Phone 7's fresh interface, or the power of Android. However, all of these platforms lack the high level of polish and vibrant ecosystems the iPhone has.",1321240388

An increasing population could not easily be represented by an increasing number of delegates, so each one had to represent more people. Representing the desires of a few thousand people is fairly simple, and there is less voter 'inertia' to carry delegates if they fail to adequately represent the people.<p>Let's just say for the sake of argument that a typical congressman can fairly represent 20,000 people. This gives them the ability to hear the issues of those people, and a group that size can pick a representative who is close to those issues. Given congresses current size the limit of effective government is  about 10,000,000 people (or perhaps just voters). To represent the United States, congress would need to have 15,000 members. As it currently stands, each member of congress represents on average 560,000 people. I'm not proposing any solutions here.

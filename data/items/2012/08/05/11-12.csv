This is the same reason we've got generations of bad PHP developers out there - they can't tell what's good or not.<p>""scores of software developers out there who have learned their craft enough to want source control""<p>How many people 'want' to learn source control, and how many people are told 'this is what we use here, go learn it'?  I suspect far more of the latter, especially with git.  People would <i>not</i> flock to git purely based on the documentation quality.  Further, I suspect that had git just been written by some random dude off the street with no major project behind it, it would have never taken off.  Using it for Linux kernel work has ensured a sizeable number of people are going to have to use it, whether they like it or not.",1344167807

Sales is generally seen as incremental value adds, and sales people get paid accordingly.<p>So how can you get seen as an incremental value adder if you're working in IT? Simple: start projects and clearly explain the impact to the bottom line. If you show the executives that you've saved the company $2MM/year forever, and that project wouldn't have happened if you hadn't dreamed it up, that's going to get recognized.

And i am also not a fan of libraries like jquery. Most of the modern browsers can do what they do a lot quicker.<p>And i should have mentioned, it is not strictly chrome only, but i have told all teachers to use chrome because firefox does not have date pickers yet. But the site is still completely functional in latest firefox and safari plus ie10 (provided teachers add dates manually). I just don't like using libraries at all. I try to avoid them until absolutely necessary. So much that i have never had to use jquery, or any other library for that matter. The app in question is quiet elaborate (feature wise) but still does not have a single file not written by me.

4341218,comment,4339262,4340254,2,0,SatvikBeri,,,"> If providing something has high impact, but that something is very common, then it has low worth, irrespective of how high impact it is. People would die without oxygen and water, but neither of these things are expensive.<p>With employees the heuristic is (very roughly) market price + VORP (value over replacement player). If an average programmer typically adds $300k of value to your company, and market price for an average programmer is $70k, and you find one who is twice as effective-you can pay them a lot more than $140k.<p>> The biggest reason CEO compensation is so high is because they are in a pyramid peak position where they can skim off a small percentage of a lot of people's productivity and claim it as their own.<p>This isn't a bad thing. If the CEO can boost the average employee's productivity by 1%, that can be enormously impactful. The difference between a CEO who makes a 1% impact and a CEO who makes a .5% impact translates to huge sums in large corporations.<p>So assuming that we had the ability to distinguish between good and bad CEOs, and that good CEOs were rare, it would certainly make sense to pay good CEOs huge sums and average CEOs much less. Unfortunately as you said, no one has gotten good at evaluating CEOs yet.",1344167129

4341162,comment,4340047,4340399,24,0,ubernostrum,,,"Hi.<p>I'm someone who is neither unwilling to learn, nor attached to how Subversion did things. And I dislike git.<p>Superficially, I dislike it because it seems very little thought has been put into giving it a coherent interface. TFA points out instances of this, and it's true: whether something is implemented as its own command or as a flag to another command sometimes seems to have been decided via dartboard rather than any sort of intelligent process.<p>I also do intensely dislike git's own man pages, which are the first thing I'd ordinarily turn to. Unfortunately, the concept of an acyclic graph has not yet arrived in that part of git.<p>I dislike the way git overloads ""branch"" with multiple meanings or, rather, forces end users to do so. Mercurial does a better job of this currently, and has built-in support for the most important case (bookmarks vs. branches, in hg's terminology).<p>I dislike the fact that every repository and every branch is on equal footing except for all the commands that work differently with a remote branch or require you to do extra setup before they do work.<p>I dislike the fact that side-by-side inspection of different branches requires me to jump through hoops, since git only wants me to see one branch at a time. SVN, for all its faults, at least got that one right -- I can actually see two different branches, at the same time, using tools that require no knowledge of anything beyond my filesystem.<p>I dislike the fact that even people who use git day in and day out still can't seem to agree on a workflow. And I'm not just talking about things like whether rebasing is fashionable this week, but very basic things like when and how to branch.<p>I also agree with the article's point about contributor workflow; git and GitHub <i>are</i> more complex for contributors. There's also very little that's ""decentralized"", since GitHub is full of canonical central repositories, which makes me wonder what we gain from pretending we're using the ""D"" in ""DVCS"".<p>And that's really just the tip of the iceberg.",1344165262
4341161,comment,4340047,4340366,3,0,chousuke,,,"The thing most people seem to miss is that you can't actually mutate a commit in git. You can only appear to do so by removing the old commit and replacing it, and all of its children if it has any, with new commits.<p>If someone depends on your ""mutated"" commit, they <i>will</i> notice that it's gone, and you can deal with the issue.<p>The most common use for rebasing and commit editing is to make commits actually sensible.<p>Huge end-of-the-day commit-all-my-work chunks do not benefit anyone. The index and rebasing allow you to create commits that make sense, regardless of the state of the working tree. In subversion, this is a painful, dangerous and error-prone operation that involves manually using diff and patch. Git frees the developer from having to worry about when to commit.",1344165258

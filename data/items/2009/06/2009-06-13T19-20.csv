656400,comment,656285,656285,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"My wife works outside the home and I work from within it, so to save on daycare costs the baby stays with me all day.<p>To keep from going utterly insane, I often make trips out to nearby coffee shops and try to work there for awhile (assuming the baby stays asleep and/or quiet). Almost every day someone will come over to me (usually an older man or woman) to ogle the cute baby and ask one of the following:<p>- Have the afternoon off work today, huh?<p>- Daddy baby-sitting this afternoon?<p>- Did mommy need a break?<p>- Mommy out shopping?<p>When I tell them that, no, I take care of the baby all day every day because I work from home, they have no way to respond. It's an utterly foreign concept in their world. Sometimes they simply say, ""wow!"" and walk off, but every now and then I get the impression that what I said was so alien that they didn't process it and continue with small talk designed around the notion that what I'm doing that particular afternoon cannot possibly be how it is every day. Mommy is still the primary and daddy is simply mommy's backup - and boy it sure is nice of me to give my obviously tired and overworked wife some time off!<p>I'm not really offended by this - more amused, I suppose. It does bother me sometimes that the men's restrooms almost universally lack baby changing tables. I've taken to just using the women's on occasion so I can change the baby. I look forward to the day when some self-rightous woman gets in my face about it... :) (At small coffee shops, this is easy since they are single-occupancy restrooms - but if I were at some large-scale place with multiple stalls per restroom, I'd be pretty much screwed.)<p>What bugs me more than the language surrounding this issue is the ""unusual"" situation of my being the primary daycare provider combined with being a programmer. As it is, very few people ""in the public"" seem to understand what programming is. Being a work-at-home dad just adds insult to injury, frankly, because the nature of the work is such that distraction and/or stress pretty much destroy the ability to do it well - and having your baby within earshot is a surefire way of becoming distracted and/or stressed out.<p>The response to the whole ""I'm a programmer and a stay-at-home dad"" thing is usually along the lines of, ""it must be so nice to have a job you can easily do from home - you're so lucky!"" ""Easy"" isn't the word I'd be using here - but since there's no simple way to associate how programming is done with any kind of work that the general public tends to understand, it's pretty much a lost cause. I'm certain most people go away thinking that I somehow get paid to play with a computer all day, so watching the kid at home must be pretty easy. Ugh.",1244921868

Huh?  I thought we flattened the management hierarchy and instituted agile programming to get rid of that nonsense.<p>He gives an extended example where pair programming enabled a new hire to configure his work environment in a half day (plus Misko's half day).  I have found that a well documented setup procedure enables a new hire to set up his environment in half a day without involving a senior programmer.  The second example of walking the new programmer through his first bug fix seems quite reasonable, but that is not pair programming in the large.<p>The comments seemed to be divided into two groups: those who were doing pair programming and loved it and those who were skeptical but were not pair programming.

In fact, the rational numbers have the same cardinality (the same infinity) as the integers, but they have the same property that you use to characterize the reals, i.e., that between any two distinct rationals there is an infinite number of rationals.<p>One way to see that there are as many integers as there are rational numbers is just to find a way to count the rational numbers.  There are a number of ways to do this.  There is a very nice and explicit way to do enumerate the positive rationals that involves the prime factorization of the integers.   Suppose first that p is a prime number.  We identify p^k with the integer p^{2k}.  For the rational number 1/p^k (p is still prime), we label it by the integer p^{2k-1}.  For a rational number p/q in lowest terms, we take the prime factorization of p and the prime factorization of q, apply the above identification to each factor p_i ^k and then take the product.  This gives a very explicit bijection between the positive rationals and the positive integers.with<p>My favorite way, though, is just to make a grid of pairs of integers (numerator, denominator), and then count them by spiraling outward on the grid.

According to some people with brains apparently wired differently than mine, you can learn all kanji in a few months with this method. The method starts with giving each compound part that appears in more complex characters an English language name. These names are then used to create stories that tie the more complex kanji together. After this you have English names for all characters. Then you go on to study their pronunciations.<p>Yes, I have seriously tried it. Maybe it works for some people. It's of course quite hard to recall why you really remember something, but in the 800 kanji I know according to the test, the vast majority I seemed to remember from seeing/using them in context while reading/writing Japanese. Mnemonics are an attractive thought, and I hope they do really work for some people. Personally I am a bit skeptical. My feeling now is that learning doesn't have to be brought up to conscious thought, but is something that happens naturally as you re-encounter things. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition</a><p>If you'd like, you can combine these two things too.

378397,comment,377991,378315,0,0,ruddzw,,,"I truly would believe that some companies like this one really don't fit in with the fake pushing of deadlines.  They believe that they really are <i>the</i> company to work for, nay, not just a company, but a movement.  If you don't want to give it all up for the idea, then they don't want you.  That's the kind of thing to stay away from, unless you really do believe in the idea, whether its your own or someone else's.",1227757892

Bacteria can't build a bigger petri dish or perhaps they wouldn't stop growing.<p>Humans could grow their food sources to match massive population growth (up to some maximum amount determined by the Earth's natural resources) our country did it. Many impoverished nations did not, but that doesn't mean it's impossible.<p>If computers can just become intelligent enough to spread beyond Earth, given the energy they have available now (which clearly they can since we did) they would theoretically be limited only by the amount of energy in the universe, but the curve would stay vertical for so long as to be effectively infinite.",1227756673

A consequence of the advance of democracy -- itself arguably a prerequisite for survival -- is that the grasshoppers will always be with us, and will always have a voice.<p>If there were a way we could magically reserve the benefits and spinoffs of human space exploration, up to and including the potential preservation of the species, to those who agreed to pay for them, I'd be much more accepting of this kind of question.<p>But colonization of other celestial bodies is too big a job for only part of humanity to tackle.  We all need to pull in that direction, or we'll fail.  So the fundamental problem becomes one of how to convince people of all walks of life that this is a worthwhile goal that can, and should, be achieved.  It's a tough sell -- like the great European cathedrals, it will take longer than any one lifetime, and cost more than any one king can afford.  But it seems possible to make sound, rational arguments in favor of such a mission.  There are times when I <i>almost</i> believe that the necessary case can be made, and that the necessary work will be done...<p>... at least until some overly-clever bozo asks an unanswerable question like, ""What's so special about humanity that it needs to be preserved?""<p>Then, I sink back into my usual unproductive attitude: ""Fine.  Screw you.  Stay behind, see if we care.""  And sure enough, as usual, nothing changes.",1327726742

The point is that people can always learn to be adequate programmers.  But if the experience of programming is so different from the way they process information, that the act of programming is mentally uncomfortable for them, then they will never be great.  The discomfort has NOTHING to do with hard work.  It's like sales.  You could spend  your whole life being a decent salesperson but if you hate interacting with people you'll never be a great salesperson that closes multi-million dollar deals.

I find the Unix way more understandable, particularly when things break.<p>Only the most simple of Windows applications get away with putting everything into a single folder under $PROGRAM_FILES. More usually, lots of stuff is in $COMMON_FILES, and may or may not be shared. And these common files are tied in to the program files via a giant complicated global variable, the registry; the program looks up ProgIDs and CLSIDs to instantiate COM objects, so the registry becomes a very sensitive source of failure, particularly when you have different versions of $COMMON_FILES that break the various linkages.<p>Furthermore, these days Windows Installer is often used to manage the Windows equivalent of packages. These too are sensitive to corruption; if you end up missing the MSI files from c:\windows\installer for one reason or another, you can easily get into a situation where you can't even reinstall an application cleanly, because the installer notices that you already have it installed, and tries to uninstall it first, but fails (usually quietly, in the middle of the installation, where the progress bar goes into reverse and at the end you get a cryptic and unhelpful error message). To fix this, you must venture forth once more into the registry, find out the cryptic (hex) name for the relevant package, and surgically excise it. Not even the MSI/MSP/etc. files have meaningful names. It's tortuous.<p>All that said, I by far prefer working in Windows to any other OS.

3521312,comment,3514721,3515172,2,0,psykotic,,,"Here's yet another proof. This one uses probability theory.<p>Let's warm up with a probabilistic proof of<p><pre><code>    1 + p + p^2 + ... = 1/(1-p)\n</code></pre>\nin the form<p><pre><code>    (1-p)(1 + p + p^2 + ...) = 1\n</code></pre>\nThis says that if you have a Bernoulli process with failure probability p and success probability 1-p, you will eventually succeed with probability 1. Indeed, (1-p) p^n is the probability that you will succeed after n failures.<p>To see this is true (it is certainly intuitively plausible), note that the probability of taking longer than n tries is p^n, which goes to zero as n goes to infinity.<p>We can apply the same kind of reasoning to<p><pre><code>    (1-p)^2 (1 + 2p + 3p^2 + ...) = 1\n</code></pre>\nAs before, we have a process with failure probability p and success probability p-1. However, rather than stopping after the first success, we will continue until we have two successes. Now take a look at the terms of the equation's left-hand side:<p><pre><code>    (1-p)^2 (n+1) p^n\n</code></pre>\nThis is the probability that we will have gotten 2 successes (and hence n failures) after n+2 steps. The second success must always be the final trial, so there are n+1 possible positions for the first success. That explains the factor of n+1.<p>With that understood, the equation simply says that we will eventually get 2 successes with probability 1. To see why, note that the probability of never getting any successes in n tries is p^n as before, which tends to zero. So we will eventually get at least one success with probability 1. But once we have that first success, getting the second success is just our first problem repeated, so we know that happens eventually with probability 1.<p>This proof technique generalizes easily. If we keep trying until we have 3 successes, we get a factor of C(n+2, 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2 for the number of ways the first 2 successes can be placed before the third and final success when there are n failures and 3 successes. We show that a first success occurs eventually with probability 1 as before, which reduces the problem to getting two subsequent successes, a problem we already solved.<p>You can see this yields a proof by induction for this whole class of series identities, but it's not of those unenlightening proofs by induction that shows you something is true but does not tell you why.",1327724453

My right-brain solves the problems, connects the top to the bottom, and is cold-and-calculating about the inner-workings.<p>It's also my experience, that if you are design-forward people discount your programming skills (all the more reason to prove them wrong) and if you are development-forward people discount your creative side (""oh, I _totally_ trust your opinion, but just to be on the safe side...."").<p>IMHO Diversity of skills gives you insight into your work and the world around you.

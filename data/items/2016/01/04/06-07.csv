10834362,comment,10832295,10832295,0,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"&quot;The Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 is a body of United States federal law designed to prevent disclosure of new inventions and technologies that, in the opinion of selected federal agencies, present a possible threat to the national security of the United States.<p>The U.S. government has long sought to control the release of new technologies that might threaten the national defense and economic stability of the country. During World War I, Congress authorized the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to classify certain defense-related patents. This initial effort lasted only for the duration of that war but was reimposed in October 1941 in anticipation of the U.S. entry into World War II. Patent secrecy orders were initially intended to remain effective for two years, beginning on July 1, 1940, but were later extended for the duration of the war. The Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 made such patent secrecy permanent, though the order to suppress any invention must be renewed each year (except during periods of declared war or national emergency).<p>The decision to classify new inventions under this act is made by &quot;defense agencies&quot; as defined by the President.&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_Secrecy_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_Secrecy_Act</a>",1451890620

It is the author&#x27;s prerogative to decide which license the software should be under. While I use permissive licenses for my work usually, I see the merit in GPL licenses and might even switch back to it at some point. They serve different goals, and I suspect that in future we&#x27;re more likely to converge towards GPL-like licenses.<p>GPL protects the rights of independent developers better than permissive licenses; and as software development becomes more accessible, we&#x27;re likely to see more work pocketed off by companies without giving due credit, or even entirely forked off. GPL clearly recognizes that companies will not give back unless required by the law. If we&#x27;re to have a fairer and more decentralized (political) power distribution, we need the protections of the GPL.<p>If I could flick a switch to turn all OSS projects to GPL, it&#x27;ll impact the entire industry in a good way. OTOH, changing everything to permissive licenses will have absolutely no impact.",1451889937

It&#x27;s mostly about risk aversion and personal responsibility of the person who&#x27;s doing the hiring. If you hire someone who doesn&#x27;t work out, it&#x27;s a failure that falls back on you. If you pass on someone amazing, nobody will ever know.<p>In my opinion, this is also the mechanism behind the &quot;<i>we just can&#x27;t find enough good people</i>&quot; trope we hear so often. The sad truth is people who interview amazingly well don&#x27;t even work out nearly as well as they hope. So instead of taking bigger risks on candidates who don&#x27;t fit the risk aversion profile, they become even more conservative in the future. The climax of this pathology can be observed inside inefficient but high-profile companies who only hire top university grads so they can tell themselves &quot;<i>we only hire the best of the best at Acme Inc</i>&quot;.<p>We&#x27;re not really in danger of implementing the hiring model you criticize any time soon. But since you bring up the human cost of that hypothetical model, I disagree. Jobs are fluid to begin with, and that trend is going to intensify. It&#x27;s not a problem as long as the company is generous with both relocation and employee exit procedures. Those who are not generous deserve to be called out anyway.",1451889257

The exact method they follow is irrelevant in comparison.<p>I&#x27;m not sure mainstream still means the same thing he&#x27;s talking about, but even in your example of &quot;industrial production&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that clear that that contradicts him. He seems to be just saying that whatever that means, it&#x27;s not enough to <i>fully</i> describe software development. But perhaps competent engineers would end up doing so anyway — in fact, if they follow a similar set of ideas that they carry with them from project to project, they would then have a theory of other people&#x27;s software that they didn&#x27;t build themselves, just from being in the same environment.<p>On the other hand, he does directly say that under the TheoryBuildingView, when the theory of a program is lost, from people being replaced too much, it is really lost, and it is very expensive to reconstruct it. So it really depends on the details of how exactly that &quot;component-based production&quot; works out in practice.<p><i>[Note: maybe I misunderstood the paper or something, don&#x27;t trust me.]</i>",1451889092

The approach I took is using the ruby gem compass and sass. I moved any sass variables into a skin.sass file and that way each site can just implement its own skin file very easily with only editing a single file and not having to jump into the main css. This has made it relatively painless to create another skin for a new site.<p>One issue I'm dealing with on this setup is that these skin files are site dependent and outside of the base code repo. They're in their own repo, but the issue is every site has its own files, so to add a new variable to the skin file requires adding it in 5-10 places, and that number is just going to get bigger. I'm curious if you guys have any suggestions.",1272643189

1308498,comment,1307944,1308381,0,0,KrisJordan,,,"Re: ""The $ before all variables is a feature [...] but we think it adds readability.""<p>The argument for the $ sign is <i>not</i> readability. If it were you'd see JavaScripter's prefixing all of their variables with a dollar sign, too. var $foo = 'bar'; is completely valid JavaScript. (Aside: $ prefix is handy in JS when holding references to jQuery objects ie $container = $('#container');)<p>The argument is for simplified string manipulation with magic quotes and is an homage to unix shell scripting.<p>Without the $ prefix string manipulation would be reserved to concatenation/printf/replacement/etc. With the $prefix you can do things like:<p><pre><code>   $base = __DIR__;\n   $user = (object)array('name'=>'Foo','dir'=>""foo"");\n   $size = ""lg"";\n   $image = ""$base/users/$user->dir/images/$size.jpg"";\n</code></pre>\nvs:<p><pre><code>   image = base + ""/users/"" + user.dir + ""/images/"" + size + "".jpg""\n</code></pre>\nWhen doing a lot of string manipulation and scripting the $ is quite handy.<p>The dollar sign also enables variable variables and dynamic property access. i.e.<p><pre><code>   $foo = 'Hello, world.';\n   $bar = 'foo';\n   echo ${$bar}; // 'Hello, world.'\n</code></pre>\n- and -<p><pre><code>   $user = (object)array('name'=>'Foo','dir'=>""foo"");\n   $prop = 'name';\n   echo $user->{$prop}; // 'Foo'\n</code></pre>\nThe dollar sign for variable variables is weak because variable variables is usually an indication of code gone awry. Dynamic property access, on the other hand, is much more useful in a dynamic language like PHP/JavaScript. That said, I believe JavaScript's solution is much more elegant. i.e.:<p><pre><code>   var user = {name: ""Foo"", dir: ""foo""};\n   var prop = ""name"";\n   alert(user[prop]); // 'Foo'\n</code></pre>\nBy overloading the index operator on objects to accept a string that dereferences to an object's property you get the same benefit in a much more elegant way.<p>Thus the $'s primary justification is magic strings and string manipulation.",1272642999

Or are businesses throwing away $1500 just to pitch to the VCs who don't have enough deal flow/opportunities that they need to attend these events (I think the big name VCs are invited to these things for free).<p>Sure, it's nice to get the 'opportunity' to pitch in front of 80 VCs. But hopefully you've already pitched to 1 or 2 in private.<p>Also, when you're pitching to a large group, assuming that there are 50 other companies pitching, is your opportunity getting lost in the drone? I think it is safe to assume that if you meet a VC during their office hours, they are likely excited to hear about a new opportunity. It should be a refreshing break from their busy day answering emails, going through financials, due-diligence, and other managerial parts of the VC life that most people probably never consider.<p>Save yourself $1500 (or whatever it costs) pay yourself $100/hour to do some research on a few local VCs or Angels you like (read their blogs, don't aim only for DFJ)  select a few and then work on  getting intros. \nGo through the history of companies they've funded previously, see if there is a connection through a friend who knew the CEO or Marketing person and see if that person will get you an intro, or something like that. \n(this is how I met with Jeff Clavier, but I didn't get funded. he had met with the CEO of a company I used to work for, he didn't fund them either)<p>Be resourceful, show that you're resourceful.

1308477,comment,1307681,1308096,0,0,roc,,,"It's always just been ""own the platform"".  ""The experience"" is just short for ""the experience of using my new platform"".<p>The platform of the day chases technology somewhat, but it's mostly a business-driven cycle:\nThe entrenched winners on the current platform have little incentive to move boldly forward into a new domain where they have little advantage and little to gain by rushing forward.<p>Competitors face an uphill battle on the current platform, but much greater opportunity by rushing into these new domains and pitching them as an alternative or unambiguous step forward. (When nothing of the sort has ever actually been true.)<p>So now we roll on to a fight over the mobile platform.  The simple analysis would be to assume that one company will again dominate and squeeze the platform.  But if we look more closely at the battle over the internet, we see the very interesting fact that <i>no-one won</i>.<p>When we look to <i>why</i>, it's almost entirely due to the emergence of Open Source as a serious competitor.  It became the vehicle whereby underdog competitors and jaded customers could gang up against the favorite to prevent any one company from truly controlling a platform.<p><i>That's</i> why Google took the Open-Source route with Android.  Not because it's necessary, but because they <i>saw</i> the iPhone coming and they knew that with an Open approach, <i>everyone</i> would help them fight Apple or any other would-be dominant.<p>(As in other areas, Google's underlying strategy is: we'll do fine as long as we can compete and don't get marginalized by someone else controlling the platform and writing us out.)<p>So my guess is that no-one will ""own"" mobile either.  There will be some large-ish companies that together dominate much of the space, but it will be more like the MS/Google/Facebook share-split on the net than the MS/Apple split on the desktop.  Also, as with the internet, the roster of the major players will be far more fluid.<p>(I don't buy ""the cloud"" or ""services"" as a distinct platform unto themselves.  They're just the continued maturation of the last platform, the same way the desktop continued to get better even after the fight over the network was well under-way.  They're being pitched as a companion feature in the mobile fight the same as integration to particular desktop software was pitched as a companion feature in the network fight.)<p>As for the 'next' platform, that tends to be something laying in plain sight while the current cycle thunders on.  Something promising but clumsy. Exposed as necessary, but still nascent.<p>My guess? Personal area networks; specifically to effect less-awkward Augmented Reality and end the proliferation of redundant sensors.<p>Anyone with a powerful laptop, smartphone and/or tablet has wanted a way to sync session, state or data streams between these devices without waiting on a slower, spotty intermediary.  Does each and every device I own need its own (mostly lame) camera?  How about one camera on my necklace/ear/glasses and a data stream?  How about my phone's GPS stream and net connection gets naturally shared to my tablet?<p>The clumsy stabs at this so far will pale to the ultimate platform the same way the first forms of the internet pale to the web today.<p>And the refinement of it, after the PAN fight settles down and everyone starts to look at the <i>next</i> big thing, promises to be truly the stuff of science-fiction.<p>Wow that was long. Sorry.",1272642570

Plugged it to the account on the Mac Mini, and now had her 5GB of photos and 20GB of music.<p>Three weeks later, Apple gave her a fixed Macbook Air.  At boot it asked if she owned another Mac, and she plugged in her Time Machine drive.  Slightly less than 9 minutes later, a reboot, and ""her"" Mac was back, again with every app and tweak.  MobileMe sync ran, and by the time she opened her iCal, it was up to date.<p>The hardware essentially didn't matter.

PHP code's ability to be run on almost any server with Apache is a big plus, but this project requires a JVM. It's different enough from PHP that the plethora of PHP programmers will need to learn a new language, which is another hurdle. It's not backwards compatible so existing PHP code will need to be rewritten. In fact, it looks very different from PHP except for the intended use of the PHP library, which is one of PHP's weakest points.<p>The project has a lot of great ideas but I don't think branding it as a PHP derivative is one of them.",1272639840

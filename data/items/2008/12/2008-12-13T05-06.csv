I use photoshop for some special effects but try and stick with vectors as long as i can until the gif/jpg stage so as i can transform them easily.<p>A lot of the most frequently used special effects in PS can be used in illustrator now in vector format which is handy like drop shadows etc. PS was never really built to make graphics, just to manipulate photographs but it serves the purpose to some extent. you might use it for blending a photo into a gradient for a banner and things like that but you can also do this in FW.<p>If you want to learn how to make graphics for web - get Fireworks and/or Illustrator, it'll make the job a lot easier and Fireworks has the best engine of the three for compressing images for the web. you'll notice the difference. The three all work together though.",1229146851

I don't know much about auction laws, but I've never heard of it being illegal to charge for participation, and if it is in fact illegal then there must be someone online who has complained about it or files a case somewhere ...",1229145837

This process was understood to begin after just four or five minutes. If the patient doesn't receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation within that time, and if his heart can't be restarted soon thereafter, he is unlikely to recover. <i>That dogma went unquestioned until researchers actually looked at oxygen-starved heart cells under a microscope. What they saw amazed them, according to Dr. Lance Becker, an authority on emergency medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""After one hour,"" he says, ""we couldn't see evidence the cells had died.</i> We thought we'd done something wrong."" In fact, cells cut off from their blood supply died only hours later.""",1229145350

The easy answer is to just gray out the older posts (only remotely challenging because the gray background of the page is about the color I WOULD have suggested for old comment text) -- and just leave the new comments as they are.<p>That allows you to easily skim the page for new content, while still allowing you to see the new posts in context.<p>A Digg-style collapse would also probably work, but for some reason, I see grayed out text more in line with the ycombinator mantra.",1229145260

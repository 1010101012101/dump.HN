Since Bitcoins cost $40 today, its a good deal, so you buy these contracts.</i><p>That sounds... unusual. A more usual formulation would be ""I give you the right to buy BTC from me for $20 on Wednesday if you give me $x today"". The fair value of x (the premium) depends on other factors besides the current price. But, more importantly, there's no ""good deal"": if you set $x below the fair value then the buyers will arbitrage the hell out of you.<p>E.g. if the fair price for the call option above is greater than $20 but you sell it for $20, then a buyer will happily take your offer: they sell 1 BTC short and get $40 in cash, pay you $20 and put the remaining $20 in the bank. Come Wednesday, they withdraw $20 (keeping the interest) and use that to cover their short sell: at worst they have to buy the stock from you for $20 (but they still make money on the interest), at best the stock has crashed and they make even more.",1362566804

Most of them were absolutely useless (at least to me), but one I found tremendously useful in various job and life settings. It was a course about assertiveness (and, in particular, assertive communication).<p>Assertive communication is about expressing a contrary position in such a way that you are totally firm, but not aggressive. Your interlocutor must understand that your stance is strong, but that you are a person who listens and is not just trying to impose mindless authority on them.<p>A basic template for assertive communication is something like:<p>1. ""I understand that [description of your interlocutor's position and why it's understandable that he holds it]"",<p>2. ""BUT [description of your position and firm arguments to support it]"",<p>3. ""THEREFORE, [conclusion, which will typically match your position but make some concessions to theirs if you can]"".<p>It sounds like something pretty trivial, but believe me, it makes a load of difference. People will be <i>way</i> more likely to accept your arguments if you explicitly show them that you have carefully listened to theirs and respect them. I have had people coming into my office to complain about something, and going out almost thanking me for that very thing!<p>Of course, this is a personal informal explanation and you'll be able to find much better explanations of this principle on Google.",1362564274

5330393,comment,5327247,5330149,2,0,tolmasky,,,"* >Incorrect in what parallel universe?\n>Yes. OS X is just a collection of applications of which iPhoto is NOT one. IIRC, they don't even bundle iLife anymore (you're supposed to get it from the App Store) but that's beside the point.*<p>iPhoto IS one. As I distinctly explained in my previous post, iPhoto comes installed on every every single Mac that Apple sells with the <i>sole exception</i> of the server configuration of the Mac Pro. Go to the Apple web page and click on any Mac and look at the ""Built-in Apps"" section, you will see iPhoto displayed right alongside ""system"" apps like Mac App Store, Mail, and Messages. iLife is just a marketing name. iTunes used to be part of iLife too. Now they're just apps, apps that 99.9% of people that purchase a Mac will find on their computers pre-installed when they open them. That was half my point: that iPhoto today is just about as much a part of a default installation of Mac OS X as any.<p><i>>Are you some naive end user OR an HN commenter that CAN tell the different between OS X and iPhoto, and doesn't complain about the latter on a thread about the first?</i><p>Now that we've gotten the fact that iPhoto will almost certainly be on my machine when I open it, it should be clear to you that it doesn't matter which of these I am. For better or worse, iPhoto is a part of the Mac experience. Drawing an imaginary line around a subset of applications and calling them ""OS"" or ""not OS"" does not take away from the fact that a bad iPhoto experience will understandably contribute to a bad Mac experience. As such, both by technical and laymen's understandings of OS, the critique is valid.<p>Edit: My mistake, iPhoto is included in the server one as well. So it turns out iPhoto comes installed on <i>every single Mac</i>.",1362564212

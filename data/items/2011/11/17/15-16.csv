""The Joy of Sex"" became so popular (in an era in which sex was widely seen as a leisure pursuit and before the scares over HIV) because many people actually did need to be told what to do. It concentrated on the emotional as well as the physical aspects.<p>Poor analogy time: owning a car does not make you an instinctive driver, suggesting you just keep taking it round the block until you figure it out is the kind of thing that only a non-driver would say.",1321545520

Perl 6 is barely Perl in any classical sense.<p>The ""Swiss Army Chainsaw"" was never intended to be Java or C#. Its weaknesses, a lack of formal typing, a small, simple set of core data structures, a terse and convoluted syntax, are actually its strengths.<p>Just as C++ is not really C, and Java is certainly not C++, Perl would be better suited by some kind of successor language that embodies the Perl spirit without having to carry forward on the same code-base or concern itself with legacy.

You can be diluted down to epsilon, but not to zero.  Also, the board has a legal fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of the shareholders, so there are limits to how capricious they can be.  At the very least they have to be able to provide themselves with plausible deniability that what they are doing is in your interests.<p>There are two legal mechanisms for avoiding future dilution.  One is to have a class of non-dilutable stock, but that is hardly ever done.  It's a huge red flag for future investors.  The other is to have a ride-along clause that gives you the option to participate in future rounds to maintain your current percentage share.  It is rare NOT to have this clause, but the problem with that is, obviously, you have to be able to come up with the cash.<p>But by far your best option, since your stake is so high, is to take a board seat.

Sure, there might be no politics within the startup, but there can be a lot of politics involving investors and their other portfolio companies, or partners and customers who are large/few enough to drive product or technical direction, etc.  I've been at startups that have been told ""don't do X because it will cannibalize stablemate Y's market"" by investors.  I've recently become aware of a VC telling companies ""use stablemate Z's product and don't criticize it in public"" situation.  This same pressure can be applied by customers and partners, driven by politics within those larger companies, and can be hard for a small company to resist.  So don't think you won't need those political skills when your working at or with a startup.",1321545306

Saying ""just use HTML5"" is fine when you serve the consumer space; it's not if you serve enterprises.<p>HTML5 is just not a go-er for enterprise products that need a rich UI.  Even if it could do everything Flex can (and it can't, yet), you need a modern browser.  Many enterprises still use IE6.  I'd say 60% of our customers are on IE6; and the remaining 40% use IE7.  Demanding IE9 would make an enterprise product dead in the water.<p>Flex fitted here.  You have enterprises who say ""no more client server, everything should be web"" but then don't give you the web platform to be able to deliver the required user experience (i.e. you must use IE6/7).  Flex let you deliver on the web, with a rich UI, on legacy browsers.<p>So you had a choice:<p>- Stay on client/server (lots of enterprises won't consider you)<p>- Develop for HTML5 (not quite prime time, no-one can buy your product as won't work on their browsers)<p>- Dumb down the UI and deliver in IE6 (workable for some projects, but not for many - some products really do need a rich UI.  Especially not doable when porting existing rich client/server app to being webbased - clients don't like backwards steps on the UI)<p>- Develop in Flex<p>So it's all well and good saying people yelled 'iceberg' but really you're between a rock and a hard place, and even with this news I'm sure most Flex enterprise developers would make the same decision again - because there really weren't many alternatives.",1321545213

Some of the problems are bugs, some are not bugs but flaws.<p>You have two hands, two independent hands. Every object in each hand has a different effect on the overall combination.

Weapon + shield or 1 weapon = block enabled.<p>There is no way to hotkey combinations (1 = sword + shield, 2 = bow, 3 = double fire, 4 = shield + heal spell, etc)<p>Furthermore not all abilities are hand abilities, some are ""Z"" abilities (shouts, powers) which are independent but each ""Z"" ability is used in combination with hand combos. You may want diff Z abilities at diff times.<p>So instead of a two-mode choice where one selection is about hands, and the 2nd is about Z you have 1-8 keys, which pressing 2x means different things depending on what you have bound to it. And no combinations. Basically they solved for the most uncommon use case, leaving the most common use case as... bleh.<p>Not to mention inventory management being gawd awful.

Your application's interactions are probably unique. There may be some design patterns (God, I hate the abuse of that phrase) that apply.<p>Bootstrap, etc are simply tools used to implement interfaces. They are not magic bullets. Design, like programming, takes time. It's not about gradients or drop shadows, but those are tools used in design.<p>It's often an iterative and collaborative process. It is not, however, ""Agile"". You can't design the interaction for a piece without looking at the whole.<p>Find someone who cares about interface, interaction, and usability. Ideally they can do graphics, html, and css. Ideally they've done some user testing before or are just really good at getting users. If you find someone like that, be prepared to pay. The good ones are few and far between and all that I know are gainfully employed or have hourly rates exceeding $200USD/hr.<p>If you want to learn more about this, there's a library of stuff out there. But just reading a bunch of books won't suddenly make your UIs prettier. But if you implement what you learn, it may improve their functionality. And that's far more important.",1321543205

But Technocracy isn't defined as well as Democracy because there's no real context from history to draw on, so I stand by it. Italy has a Technocratic government right now.<p>That said, A Technocracy does not imply dictatorship. Nor does it imply despotism. These are two ""aspects"" of a Technocracy you've just made up on the spot to support what you believe.<p>All I ask is that my chancellor be a qualified and learned economist. That my minister for health be qualified in a related field such as medicine or biology. That the scientific/ethical debates in parliament (or congress) be argued between scientific experts and philosophers and economists, not by people who have never actually had a real job outside of politics, or have little to no education in the field they are responsible for. When our leaders can say sincerely ""I asked God what to do"", and everyone thinks that's ok, we've lost the plot. That's Tyranny.<p>What I want is to feel confident that the people making the decisions that govern my life know what the hell they're talking about. What I have right now, what we all have right now, are leaders who make decisions based on how much money someone is willing to pay them, what they feel in ""their gut"" to be right, or what some magical fucking tyrant living in the sky tells them to do.<p>Democracy my arse. It's a joke.",1321542013

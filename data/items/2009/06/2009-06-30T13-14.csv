In 98 pages they basically show that the science IS NOT conclusive. It may well be C02, it may not. Having worked with the EPA before, they find pretty much every excuse to ban or regulate something so when they say it is NOT doing what others say, I listen.<p>Interestingly one of the main factors they contribute to their differing results from the IPCC report is that the IPCC report closed its paper submission windows in early 2006 even though it was published in 2007, so the work is 3 years out of date. This paper was written in the last 2 months and cites dozens of papers over the last 3 years that contradict the IPCC's ""findings"".",1246370354

It's really unpleasant to look at and think about people doing unpleasant work in unpleasant conditions""<p>That really is the crux of the issue in many regards. The aid programs that I have seen work focus on education and loans for people who wish to better their skills or go into a different field rather than trying to come in and 'fix' the system till it looks like the what we in the western world recognize. At the same time, there are certain conditions that no human should ever have to be exposed to.  As anything, it is a balance and I believe both viewpoints are needed for there to be a total solution.<p>Thank you again for the thoughtful discussion.",1246367152

Companies that weren't much more than pot-fueled ideas scrawled on napkins by up-too-late bong-smokers were taken public via IPOs, hyped in the media and sold to the public for megamillions. It was as if banks like Goldman were wrapping ribbons around watermelons, tossing them out 50-story windows and opening the phones for bids. In this game you were a winner only if you took your money out before the melon hit the pavement.<p>It sounds obvious now, but what the average investor didn't know at the time was that the banks had changed the rules of the game, making the deals look better than they actually were. They did this by setting up what was, in reality, a two-tiered investment system - one for the insiders who knew the real numbers, and another for the lay investor who was invited to chase soaring prices the banks themselves knew were irrational. While Goldman's later pattern would be to capitalize on changes in the regulatory environment, its key innovation in the Internet years was to abandon its own industry's standards of quality control.<p>""Since the Depression, there were strict underwriting guidelines that Wall Street adhered to when taking a company public,"" says one prominent hedge-fund manager. ""The company had to be in business for a minimum of five years, and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. But Wall Street took these guidelines and threw them in the trash."" Goldman completed the snow job by pumping up the sham stocks: ""Their analysts were out there saying Bullshit.com is worth $100 a share.""",1246367119

The difference is that some of them have quite a lot of results (Techcrunch, Wired), but not nearly as high of a average score.<p>In fact, it looks like the sites hitting the top of the list for average score are ones that are written by a single author, who has several strong opinions (ZedShaw is a good example).

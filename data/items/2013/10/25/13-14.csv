C# (my primary language) has parallel collections as of .Net 4.0 and with .Net 4.5 you have the async keyword support on top of the TPL. Could you elaborate on the differences between Scala and C# which make Sala more preferable for you? I&#x27;m not trying to start a war on C# vs Scala, I&#x27;m genuinely interested in the differences (I enjoy learning new languages, but for the right reasons)",1382709569

Knowing what other sovereign actors do and think without filters removes suspicion. Government officials getting spied on just shows incompetence from those go spied and they should up their game. I think security agencies in many countries will now update their  policies and get funding for doing so.

This might be used, for example, if you want to depreciate fixed assets using a method your accounting software does not support.<p>2.  Post-processing data.  You might do this if you have a report from an accounting system but your final report needs to take into account additional factors.  Some of my customers use Excel to turn trial balance data from their accounting systems into financial statements.<p>Another example of post-processing might be if you take aggregated sales reports from an accounting system and further process it by business folk who don&#x27;t know the programming environment.<p>As for paper:  Yes, separation of duties is a part of it but paper has an advantage that no computer system can match, namely that if you keep your books in indelible ink, then alteration of numbers is obvious on audit.  This is a weak point of electronic media.  You can lock it down, but it is always possible for someone to unlock it.  So with comparable policies, paper wins out anti-fraud-wise.",1382709020

I&#x27;ve never needed that it comes naturally.<p>My life partner, actually, is sort of stepping into the role you describe.  It&#x27;s hard for me letting go, but I&#x27;m far more likely to be okay with my partner taking that role than some random sleazebag.    I mean, her background is more technical than mine;  which is a downside in that role (though an upside for me actually following.  Like most technical people, I have a hard time accepting leaders who don&#x27;t have a technical background.) but eh, hiring for that role is really hard; judging from my past, when it comes to evaluating business people? I&#x27;m worse than random.<p>But it&#x27;s still ultimately my business, and ultimately mistakes (or unethical decisions) made by that business are still my responsibility.     Perhaps I will feel differently if someday I&#x27;m no longer the majority shareholder?  (my partner is vesting in over time, so I am still the majority shareholder by quite a bit..)<p>But it&#x27;s probably good that it&#x27;s her;  we have a lot of shared values and cultural background, and ultimately I see her as a good person, so while she&#x27;s probably not the best businessperson available, she might be the best at working with me.<p>>I simply weigh the downside to any decision vs. the upside. It&#x27;s almost automatic. After a while your brain just works that way.<p>Yeah, but almost nobody weighs moral concerns as zero.  I mean, for an extreme example, you wouldn&#x27;t murder someone for money even if you were certain you wouldn&#x27;t get caught, and wouldn&#x27;t face any negative consequences save those you imposed yourself.<p>(I&#x27;m not claiming that &#x27;sharp&#x27; business practices are anything like murder;  I&#x27;m just pointing out that you have the same line I have, even if yours isn&#x27;t quite in the same place as mine.

Back in the 40s through 60s, both the Swiss and American watch companies standardized on a 6-point case back that was removable with a two or three-pronged adjustable wrench. The same design is still being used for the most part in middle luxury brands. Though, if you ever look at the back of a modern mid-100 dollar watch (Casio, off-brands, etc.), you&#x27;ll probably see a little lip where you can place the blade of a knife. Giving the knife a slight twisting motion easily pops the back off, giving anyone the ability to change the battery. But go take a look at some of the higher luxury brands and you&#x27;ll see various variations of case backs. Rolex uses a fluted design unique to themselves. Breitling uses a design similar to the older 6-point, but it&#x27;s more like a 18-sided polygon that requires a wrench with flat jaws. Omega uses a design with a number of deep holes in the case back, requiring a wrench with points that fit loosely on the back (instead of tightened onto it).<p>The reasons for the &quot;proprietary&quot; case back designs, especially with Rolex, is exactly the same as Apple using non-standard Pentalobe screws, which you point out. These things are not serviceable to 95% of the population (and if you think that number is high, go visit the mid-west for a week and get out of the big city costal echo-chambers). I can&#x27;t tell you how many times some wiseguy walked into my shop with a small container containing all but a couple pieces of his watch asking me to put it back together after they took it apart to do some trivial task, most of the time one that probably didn&#x27;t require any disassembly to begin with.<p>If you think you can personally  take apart a retina MacBook Pro and replace the trackpad, no one is stopping you from buying the special screwdriver and doing it yourself with help from iFixit, but Apple certainly isn&#x27;t going to honor that warranty. Requiring at least one hoop for you to jump through in order to even get the back off is enough evidence for them to know that anyone walking through their door with their product rattling around in an altoids tin intentionally decided to disassemble the thing themselves. It&#x27;s a premeditative action, instead of an accidental impulse.",1382708539

6611488,comment,6610593,6610593,12,0,karterk,,,"I&#x27;m part of a team who moved from Java to Scala recently (C# is a nicer language than Java these days). Apart from me, nobody else had real-world Scala experience but were generally good programmers and were able to pick up the functional aspects of Scala fairly quickly. The move was a big success, and a frequent comment I hear is &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine moving back to Java&quot;.<p>One of the reasons why the migration worked for us was that one can (with a bit of discipline) get into idiomatic Scala slowly. You can definitely start off writing Java-ish Scala and still gain a lot from the decreased verbosity and nicer APIs. You can safely stay away from over-using implicits, functional programming etc. till you get a good grasp of the language. With excellent Java interoperability, you don&#x27;t have to convert your entire stack to Scala overnight, but slowly replace old code with Scala.<p>With respect to performance, if you insist on writing idiomatic Scala, there is definitely a performance overhead, because the JVM is not suited for large amounts of small allocations, as is often the case with an immutable style of programming. However, we run a pretty large scale data crunching system, and depending on what your code does, CPU bound performance hit pales in comparison to the network and I/O waits, so for us, it was not a big deal. When we absolutely needed to optimize a tight loop or something, we wrote C-like Scala, using while loops and mutable data structures.<p>Addendum: The greatest win for us was the readability of the code base. Scala allows you to largely keep your data structures immutable, so it&#x27;s much easier to reason about. With parallel collections, Actors and Futures, concurrency support is excellent as well. You definitely need to pick up a few new concepts, but the time is well spent as once you get a hang of those things, your productivity will be 10x - you don&#x27;t have to wrangle with primitive concurrency constructs.",1382708392

I already posted a more detailed explanation here:<p><a href=""http://pl.atyp.us/2013-10-comedic-open-storage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pl.atyp.us/2013-10-comedic-open-storage.html</a><p>I tried to post a comment on the NSOP (Not So...), but first I got &quot;HTTP internal error&quot; and then I got &quot;duplicate comment&quot; but it still hasn&#x27;t shown up, so I&#x27;ll post it here.<p>&quot;The private bit is important; although various techniques have been created for shared (multi-master) access to the interconnect, all were relatively expensive, and none are supported by the consumer-grade drives which are often used for scale-out storage systems.&quot;<p>I was working on multi-master storage systems using parallel SCSI in 1994.  Nowadays you can get an FC or SAS disk array for barely more than a JBOD enclosure.  Shared storage is neither new nor expensive.  It&#x27;s not common at the single-disk layer, but it&#x27;s not clear why that should matter.<p>The idea of network disks with an object interface isn&#x27;t all that new either.  NASD (<a href=""http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/NASD/Talks/Seagate-Dec-14-99.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/NASD/Talks/Seagate-Dec-14-99....</a>) did it back in &#x27;99, and IMO did it better (see <a href=""http://pl.atyp.us/2013-10-comedic-open-storage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pl.atyp.us/2013-10-comedic-open-storage.html</a> for the longer explanation.<p>&quot;Dont fall into the trap of thinking that this means well see thousand upon thousands of individual smart disks on the data center LANs. Thats not the goal.&quot;<p>...and yet that&#x27;s exactly what some of the &quot;use cases&quot; in the Kinetics wiki show.  Is it your statement that&#x27;s incorrect, or the marketing materials Seagate put up in lieu of technical information?<p>&quot;they dont have to use one kind of (severely constrained) technology for one kind of traffic (disk data) and a completely different kind of technology for their internal HA traffic.&quot;<p>How does Kinetic do anything to help with HA?  Array vendors are not particularly constrained by the interconnects they&#x27;re using now.  In the &quot;big honking&quot; market, Ethernet is markedly inferior to the interconnects they&#x27;re already using internally, and doesn&#x27;t touch any of the other problems that constitute their value add - efficient RAID implementations, efficient bridging between internal and external interfaces (regardless of the protocol used), tiering, fault handling, etc.  If they want to support a single-vendor object API instead of several open ones that already exist, then maybe they can do that more easily or efficiently with the same API on the inside.  Otherwise it&#x27;s just a big &quot;meh&quot; to them.<p>At the higher level, in <i>distributed</i> filesystems or object stores, having an object store at the disk level isn&#x27;t going to make much difference either.  Because the Kinetics semantics are so weak, they&#x27;ll have to do for themselves most of what they do now, and performance isn&#x27;t constrained by the back-end interface even when it&#x27;s file based.  Sure, they can connect multiple servers to a single Kinetics disk and fail over between them, but they can do the same with a cheap dual-controller SAS enclosure today.  The reason they typically don&#x27;t is not because of cost but because that&#x27;s not how modern systems handle HA.  The battle between shared-disk and shared-nothing is over.  Shared-nothing won.  Even with an object interface, going back to a shared-disk architecture is a mistake few would make.",1382708377

Whatever the trade offs in monthly premiums vs. deductibles, the minimum plan has a 10 or so less or non-essential benefits, like covering your children to or through age 26; the old &quot;real insurance&quot; high deductible major medical (catastrophic coverage) plan is soon to be illegal except for around 2 of the 18 million who managed to squeeze through the needle of grandfathering.  Letting just anyone window shop would enable a lot of bad press.<p>It was decided the Federal system was the only one that could calculate subsidies, the state exchanges and insurers have to use it.  Whoever does it, this process is absolutely essential to avoid screwing worse many of the above who will lose their insurance come Jan 1 and can&#x27;t afford the new plans without a subsidy.  That, BTW, is the really hard deadline to all this, it&#x27;s one thing to be changed an already delayed once penalty for not getting insurance, quite another to lose it altogether because your old one was outlawed and the government can&#x27;t get it&#x27;s act together to let you buy a one compliant with the new law.  And to the extend young whippersnappers feel public spirited enough to buy insurance they don&#x27;t really need (beyond major medical coverage) so they can help to pay for the 50-64 bracket this system is truly subsidizing, showing them after subsidy prices makes that easier.  The initial financials of the system require about 3 million of them out of the total 7 million.<p><i>Someone</i> should do a bunch of verification things, and in theory we trust &quot;the government&quot; to do this....<p>FICO scores are understandably part of new insurance policy pricing (<i>someone&#x27;s</i> going to be on the hook for when customers don&#x27;t pay co-pays, deductibles or premiums, so it&#x27;s an input into pricing), so Experian is checked for yours (which is currently a nightmare for those who don&#x27;t have one, like sick children who&#x27;ve never really needed to get a credit card etc.; there&#x27;s supposed to be a process, but it&#x27;s hard/impossible to get to it on Healthcare.gov or the phone numbers for it).<p>Credit scores are absolutely tied to real identities, and you can&#x27;t let just anyone find a particular person&#x27;s one, directly or indirectly.  Only way I can see to have done this differently would still be a stiff identity check and then telling a person what their&#x27;s is, so they could plug that in along with everything else prior to &quot;window shopping&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d note that the current system doesn&#x27;t allow &quot;what if&quot; games, which due to the subsidy etc. system would be incredibly useful.

Two future clients are discussing your company.  What are they saying about it, in specifics? If one of them asks the other &#x27;What do you love most about them?&#x27;, what would the answer be?  How about if the question is &#x27;What annoys you the most?&#x27; (be honest and think hard, there are always tradeoffs)&quot;.<p>Make notes for each of these thought exercises. Trello is good for this, as is a mind mapping tool like XMind.<p>Then go over your notes with your friend and brainstorm about ideas, capturing all of them with no filtering.  No idea is off the table at this point. You are looking for over 100 names.<p>Next go over your list and rate each one with 1-5 stars.  When you are done get rid of anything that isn&#x27;t 5 stars.<p>Now it&#x27;s time to go over each of the 5-star names and ask the following questions:<p>.. is it generic enough to not tie you to specific technology, while specific enough to capture what distinguishes you?<p>.. is is short?<p>.. is it memorable?<p>.. how whimsical is it?  Higher is usually better, but YMMV depending on your niche (financial software consultants might not want ButterfliesAreFree,Inc., then again they might...an no you can&#x27;t use that one :) ).<p>.. is the domain name taken? Are variations on the name taken?  Depending on your creativity you might want to use this as a first pass filter on your 5-star names.<p>I also tend to advise clients to either (a) pick a single word that represents them and change it with a prefix or suffix not usually used (e.g., Aptivity [not a client], Communitivity), or (b) pick two words that together represent them and use razr-spelling ( remove one or more of eliminate some vowels, phonetic spelling, etc.).<p>An important thing to not forget is branding.

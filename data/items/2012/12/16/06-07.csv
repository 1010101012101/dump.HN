Taking a course in the stats department alongside an econometrics course was bound to confuse any student.<p>Come on, this is silly.  Calling things RSS vs. SSR might confuse an undergrad, but I've taken both classes (stats intro to linear regression + econ intro to linear regression) at the same time and saw barely a difference in the material.  The stats class had a greater emphasis on finite-sample properties under normality and the econ class on asymptotics.  Not a huge change, and the differences were complementary.<p>We both know that the ""bizarre obsession with [generalized] method of moments"" is because moments come out of models with rational agents, not distributions.",1355641091

There is no scenario in my system in which the browser sees any keys or passphrases, encrypted or otherwise--that would only happen in a signed standalone client program capable of running native code. (The browser <i>does</i> see a password in the potential ""send-only"" scenario I described earlier, but that's a separate secret unrelated to the PGP key.) Yes, it would be possible to maliciously alter that code and redistribute it, but it would be difficult since the source would be open and anyone could verify the hash. At that point, it's probably easier to just infect the host computer with a keylogger some other way (and wait for the user to lose their key so that they need to use their passphrase, then intercept 2 factor auth somehow), but that's like the <i>deus ex machina</i> of computer security (and still not at all automatable at large scale as far as I can see, especially due to 2FA).",1355641071

Understand that web works on a client/server architecture and a web developer has to deal with both client side technologies(that your browser renders e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and server side language/frameworks/databases(you've got many language choice in PHP/Python/Ruby/JavaScript/C#/java/etc)<p>3. Focus on front-end first. It will make you a web designer if not a web developer. You don't need any web server to do this. Just write code in files and run it using your web browser.<p>- Learn how to make web pages using HTML5.<p>- Learn how to style it using CSS3.<p>- Learn how to do client side scripting using javascript. I will recommend you to use the book - ""JavaScript : The good parts"".<p>- You can then learn javascript libraries like ""jQuery"" or front-end frameworks like ""twitter bootstrap"" which will make life easier for you.<p>4. Setup server environment on your PC. I would suggest you to start with PHP programming language, MySQL database, Apache Web Server. You can also choose python, ruby, etc but php will be easy to learn if you are new. If you are using linux you can install LAMP(Linux Apache MySQl PHP). If you are using Windows you can install WAMP. If you are using Mac you can install MAMP. Learn how to serve your html/css/javascript code using server and access it on your browser using localhost.<p>5. Learn server side scripting using PHP. Use MYSQL as database if needed. Learn to use tools like phpmyadmin.<p>6. Do a small web development project like making your own Website/Blog. Don't use blogging softwares like wordpress. Make everything yourself.<p>7. Buy a domain for your personal website and a shared hosting account from a web hosting provider(e.g., <a href=""http://www.webfaction.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webfaction.com/</a>). Use a FTP client to upload your code and host your website online.<p>9. You can then choose to learn MVC architecture and any MVC php framework like codeigniter, kohana, symfony, etc. Rewrite your website/blog using framework.<p>9. Once you are comfortable you can think about switching to any other language/framework combinations like Ruby/Rails, Ruby/Sinatra, Python/Django, Python/Flask, JavaScript(Node.js)/Express.js , C#/Asp.net MVC, etc.<p>10. Remember that it is a long and slow process and it will take you years to evolve as decent web developer. Focus on ""learn-do-learn-do"" approach. keep learning new things and use it to make new things. Best of luck.",1355640690

I tried to read a few books on the topic, and this is the first one that managed to catch my attention. It's straightforward and thorough, and he's very good at explaining things that are very hard to put words to. Mindfulness is the core of the book, meditation (as in exercises) is secondary. I think it's an outstanding introduction to the what and why of mindfulness, and a gentle intro to meditation. The audio book version is quite good to, he's an outstanding speaker, with a distinct voice. Look him up.<p>Anyone who often feels like the mind is a chaotic stream of thoughts and emotions that one can barely control might find this read quite useful. I wish I had read it twenty years earlier. That said I've met a couple people who couldn't latch onto it, so your mileage may vary.",1355640464

I've found Django's ORM pretty useful in that, it reduces the amount of typing you need to do. BlogPost.objects.filter() is shorter than ""SELECT * from BlogPost where ...."". Of-course, Django's ORM gives you a few ways to implement complex SQL statements. However, ORMs in my opinion aren't that great with dealing with complexity. They can take you only so far before you realize that ""Hey, I could write this query much better manually"". At the point where you need that, ORMs are pretty useless. There've been times that I've manually enforced database level constraints and enforced uniqueness on 2 or more columns with a replace statement to avoid race conditions. An ORM wouldn't be able to handle that kind of thing. Not at the moment anyway.<p>But that brings me to my point.

If a pathogen enters the body and is not attacked, it may easily kill you, for this reason pathogens, once identified, are <i>always</i> attacked. There is a system that is responsible for identifying threats(lymphocyte), some times this messes up and identifies the wrong thing as a threat. This is easier than you might think because your body makes antibodies(attack living stuff like bacteria but quasi stuff like viruses) and antitoxins(attacks toxins), when the body sees a foreign substance in the blood, it only takes one lymphocyte is misread it as a threat, and boom all-of-sudden your body fights like the devil to kill/remove/subdue that thing.<p>Backing down the response would alleviate some allergy problems, but it would also cause the body to perhaps miss some actually-bad things in your system. It&#x27;ll be hard to change this, and problem inadvisable, as the system has been tuned over millions of years. The best course of action is probably treating symptoms, or finding targeted and intelligent ways to trick the system into handling these corner cases better.",1428451128

This kind of approach has failed whenever it is tried, from Alexander&#x27;s empire to the Crusades to the Soviet Union to the modern social-environment movement. Huge sweeping changes, driven from the top, that resulted in failure, war, starvation and suffering.<p>The Malthusian argument that even though everything has been getting better for hundreds of years, everything is about to get much, much worse also requires extraordinary evidence at this point, given it has failed so many times as to be counted as an extraordinary claim.<p>Might there be a grindingly ugly end to global civilization in the next few hundred years? Sure. It could happen.<p>Can it be prevented by any kind of massive top-down command scheme? On the overwhelming bulk of the historical evidence, probably not.<p>Could it be prevented by increased urbanization, empowering women, and technological improvements? Quite possibly, as those things are the drivers of so much good over the past several decades.

9337926,comment,9336392,9337869,0,0,andrew,,,"In principle, I love the idea of weighting the distribution of an employee equity pool away from up-front grants and toward follow-on grants. It solves what I think is an even bigger challenge of equity grants, which is that someone&#x27;s financial outcome is largely dependent on a guess you make about their impact before they&#x27;ve even worked a day.<p>In practice though, I think it&#x27;s hard for a lot of companies, because unless you&#x27;re planning on having a larger % of the company in the employee equity pool in the long-term, you&#x27;re basically robbing from the size of the up-front grants to feed the follow-on grants. So when you give your employee his or her offer letter, you&#x27;ll say, &quot;I know this is less than what you&#x27;re getting at other companies, but if you perform better than 50% of the employees here, you&#x27;ll end up getting more than what you&#x27;d get from other companies.&quot; A lot of employees are just going to go for the sure thing, making recruiting harder.<p>At Detour we do give big follow-on grants, but we can do that because our employee option pool is like 45% or something, which we can only do because I&#x27;m funding the company, so it&#x27;s not really a replicable model (while progressive equity is, I think).",1428450379

I really like the concept of giving everyone financial independence, but it must take the right combination of culture, investors, and valuation to make it more motivating than it is inhibiting.<p>Also, could the redistribution of equity at the time of sale have more cost in tax obligations than earlier redistribution?<p>While I really appreciate the legal docs, the truth is in a longer description that remains easily comprehensible.

The big difference I remember with etcd was partition tolerance. Last I checked Zookeeper was all on the consistency side and it&#x27;s partition tolerance basically just wrote off the smaller partition. Either choice can be a good thing or a bad thing for a directory/orchestration store, but particularly as you scale up to large numbers, partition tolerance semantics seem to better match the use cases.<p>So I don&#x27;t think etcd is all inferior to Zookeeper, and I understand the desire to build a system where all components are fundamentally AP, but sometimes having a bit of impurity and some duct tape hackery in your model can help you get out the door faster and focus on more significant technical challenges that will help you build your community.

All my life, I&#x27;ve struggled with procrastination. I find it very hard to sit down and work on a project without an external motivator, and on many nights I end up vegging out in front of the TV or aimlessly clicking around on the internet. As a result, even though I am successful on an absolute scale — CS degree from a top-10, worked at a startup and a large company, enough savings to last a few years of solo development — by my own metric of success, I am crippled by the feeling that it&#x27;s &quot;too late&quot;. Every day, I read an article by some hot-shot young dev who has a handful of fancy projects behind his belt (not to mention a great website and design sensibility) while I have exactly zero — and he&#x27;s half a decade younger than me! How will I ever be able to catch up? Experience-wise, I&#x27;m still a junior dev.<p>It&#x27;s a constant, irrepressible gnawing in my chest. Every morning, I take tally of my age. Whenever I encounter a technical article, I immediately and compulsively investigate the author&#x27;s age. If I&#x27;m behind — which I always am — I will lock myself in my room and force myself to work, even though I still end up on HN half the time. It&#x27;s exhausting and terrifying, but I also don&#x27;t want to loosen up. At my core, I am intensely ambitious. I have so many great ideas, and knowing that the main obstacle between them and me is only myself keeps me in an endless state of panic.<p>It&#x27;s been getting better. For the first time in my life, my procrastination is starting to get tamed. I&#x27;ve been working hard on my first big project, and I expect it&#x27;s going to be a great one. But I can&#x27;t help but feel that if I had started in earnest at 25, at 21, at 19 — then maybe the list of accomplishments at the end of my life will be longer. Mentally, I&#x27;ve resigned to the fact that I&#x27;ve procrastinated away a decade of valuable time, and it just endlessly haunts me.<p>Does anybody else have this problem?

These various chemicals trigger reactions when humans consume the plants. There&#x27;s a credible argument that the increased &quot;intensity&quot; of modern agriculture has resulted in stressed plants dominating the modern food supply. This is very easy to see if you buy fresh potatoes. The ones that have been cut up a bit by the harvester often smell weird, taste bad, and can even be a bit green with solanine production. You&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s typically much harder to get good potatoes in March and April as the ones on sale have been in cold storage a long time and are stressed.<p>I think peanuts as a crop have suffered from very intensive industrialization more than other crops.

Germany has about a third the rate of gun ownership the US does and its rates of serious violent crimes, both with and without guns are much less than a third those of the US. All of Scandinavia, Switzerland and Iceland have high rates of gun ownership and even lower crime rates.<p>The prisons might have an impact, but I think at least as important is the post-release re-integration in to society. The parole system in the US is set up more to ensure that released prisoners can be easily subjected to further punishment if need be than to help them lead productive lives.<p>An important factor is that those countries have a distinct culture and sense of community. People are more willing to hurt others they don&#x27;t see as part of a group to which they are loyal.

But I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s important to defer belief and judgement until after having made a confirmation. So I&#x27;ll answer as if you might be interested in a sincere discussion.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with the specific claims you&#x27;ve articulated as they are articulated, but that&#x27;s not an immutable fact, merely a contingent one. But I think the discussion has value, even if we disagree. And I think we might agree on the substance more than is apparent through the disagreement on the particular expression.<p>> What you&#x27;re missing is the fact that only an enlightened being knows how to make others be enlightened<p>Taking, for the sake of argument, this is true (I don&#x27;t think that it has been justified, however), it doesn&#x27;t follow that a teaching from another source might not be useful in the course of enlightenment, only that the source couldn&#x27;t <i>know</i> that the teaching was useful.<p>> and only an enlightened being can give a teaching which can be practiced in order to obtain enlightenment.<p>Assuming that enlightenment comes from practicing something that can be reduced to a teaching, if any being achieves enlightenment, they must do so on the basis of a practice they engaged in prior to achieving enlightenment, which they could also have provided to others as a teaching at that time. Even if they could not have <i>known</i>, for whatever definition of knowledge you are using, that it was a practice that would lead to enlightenment.<p>So, the specific argument you make here is unconvincing.<p>In general, and in wider scope, your broader argument seems to conflate the essential truth of enlightenment with practices which are useful along the path from where people are to enlightenment, and to conflate the inability to fully and accurately relate the former with an inability to relate anything about the latter. I do not disagree with the claim that no religion can communicate what enlightenment essentially is. I do disagree with the claim that no religion can communicate practices which are useful to those seeking enlightenment on that path. (I would also disagree with the claim that such useful information is the exclusive domain of any one religion.)<p>And I&#x27;d also say that many of the observations you make are things that <i>many</i> religions already teach, and which are <i>among</i> the teachings that they teach which are useful to enlightenment. (Its also true that while they are in the body of teachings of many religions, they are also teachings that are also often de-emphasized by religious authorities, and that that is a real problem.

If you leave, then those shares you earned slowly deflate in value.<p>You could even recognize higher risk of earlier employees by issuing special shares which have some mechanism by which if they leave, those shares may still deflate, but at a slower rate than later ones. e.g. for every time-period distribution of shares, these shares receive some fraction of the new distribution.",1428447914

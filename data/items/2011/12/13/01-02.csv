It would remain to be seen whether or not this proves to really be the intractable problem you're imagining it to be - let's not forget that any other method will also produce bugs. The question is whether they're produced at the same rate or not. I have no evidence to really say whether or not what you're imagining would be prohibitive to using this method but my (strong) opinion is that it wouldn't be (time will tell as I put this into practice though, and I'll be following up with more posts about it).",1323741139

Almost 40% of women, \nhowever, believed not enough time was devoted to \naddressing company diversity. Additionally, women in \nstartups were much more likely to endorse companywide practices to increase diversity than their male \ncounterparts in startups (65% versus 41%).""<p>""Female status and underrepresented racial/ethnic \nstatus were both significant predictors of negative\nworkplace experiences suggesting that negative \nworkplace experiences increase with membership in \nboth demographic groups  (F(1,555)=15.4, p<.00, and \nF(1,555)=7.47, p<.01;  B=.68, SE=.18, p<.01 and B=.73, \nSE=.29, p<.05; Appendix 2)""<p>Now that's the way to shoot down a ""there's no problem here it's just that women don't want to do startups"" argument.<p>Thanks, I had no idea the numbers were so compelling.

3345968,comment,3344982,3345469,1,0,jen_h,,,"I think it's fantastic that you're encouraging them to do this--things will never get better without us chipping away at it, but also understand, too, how hard it is to be ""confidently independent"" when it comes to asking for recognition for one's work--it may be a bit illuminating to ask the women you care about how being ""confidently independent"" when negotiating raises and salaries when job hunting really works out for them.<p>In my experience, people (both men and women) can be really turned off by a woman asking for what she's worth. Personally, I haven't gotten <i>too</i> worked up about this when it happens to me--I think it's educational--it's good to know what you're getting into and how a prospective employer or current employer responds to that, to me, tells me a lot about whether I'd want to work or stay there.<p>But, witness, just a few small bites when job hunting or negotiating raises:<p>""You answered all the database questions right, but you laughed when they gave you the logic question about the lockers and prime numbers. You're just not technical enough! You ask for too much money anyway.""<p>""We just can't justify giving you a raise of <i>seven</i> percent. Sure, we just justified adding three headcount to replace you and will end up paying a way less qualified guy 30k more than we paid you in just a few months, but still, whatcha thinkin', girlie? A seven percent raise is nuts right now!""<p>""We can't believe that you won't accept our job offer--sure, it's got fewer benefits, you'll be locked in a closet all day doing boring work and will make only 3k more a year, and we understand that due to the benefit reduction and longer commute, you'll actually be making a good 5k less than you are now - but we're a WONDERFUL company with great people...and you're TOTALLY overpaid now! Honestly, Jen, we don't know what your current company is thinking, paying you as much as they do.""<p>It can be kind of exhausting and can really knock your confidence if you don't pretend it's just a game...we've either got to keep chipping away at it...or? What's wrong with saving a little money, figuring out wtf to do about health insurance, then jumping off the track and going our own way? I assure you that I don't have to be held back by these goofy attitudes anymore in my startup (full disclosure: you WILL have to deal with this when dealing with some investors and potential acquirers--but this just forces you to work that much harder at staying independent and self-sufficient so that you can tell them no if you need to). Bootstrapping a startup, right now, it can be terrifying, but you're not held back - people love or hate your work, not you - your users likely don't even know who you are and don't care, either. It's actually pretty amazing.",1323741121

Lighting, ceilings and floor choice are tremendously important in workspace design, and that place looks, frankly, like most other poorly designed office spaces.  Once you commit to open plan, you've already thrown acoustics and a quiet working environment almost entirely out of the window.  At that point the awful carpeting and 1970s style ceiling tiles only serve to reinforce the disingenuous nature of their supposedly hip concessions to progressive workplace design (I'm looking at you, Herman Miller fluorescent light fixtures).<p>Then again, it's really shocking how strict most office space management companies and building code bureaucrats tend to be when it comes to how you can use your space.  I've seen several really great spaces with all kinds of potential just completely hamstrung by idiotic restrictions surrounding fire sprinklers and ancient ventilation systems.

It is highly likely that some incarnation and/or descendant of SOPA will eventually become law.  However, it's critical that SOPA does not.  If publicly defeated, future versions will be less ambitious and more rational.",1323738380

Turning off a site is a clear message, it's very direct and not manipulative beyond declaring your support either way.<p>Changing the algorithm is more insidious, unless or even if you had a disclaimer on top saying you modified the result to fit your agenda. I think this is comparable to modifying the Wikipedia SOPA article to be non-neutral, which is a terrible idea of course.<p>In the same vein, I don't think blanking Wikipedia can violate NPOV (in its Wikipedia sense), since this policy refers to editorial content: the articles themselves need to be neutral. The concept of NPOV is simply not applicable to the Wikipedia enterprise as a whole.",1323738224

However, you're forgetting that for some of those 140 hours you're being lectured by the top professors in the area. You're unlikely to have a question that they can't answer. Other parts of those 140 hours are spent talking with some of the smartest students on the planet. Some more of those 140 hours are spent solving problems carefully designed to maximize understanding. If you can't figure something out, you have fellow students, TAs and professors to harass. Somebody studying alone at home doesn't have this environment.<p>And then you need to take into account the fact that if you're undergrad at MIT you're already smarter than 95% or so of the population. Basically, the takeaway here is that your 70/140 hour number applies to something like 0.1% of the population under the assumption that they're studying CLRS at home.<p>You need to see this in context. This is advice for CS undergrads looking for jobs. This advice is being given out on reddit. Anybody who needs this advice (and CS undergrads from MIT certainly don't) will not be able to work through CLRS in a week.",1323738201

3345839,comment,3342194,3344298,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I don't see you as entirely off base either.<p>The thing is, our economy is based on two fundamental assumptions:<p>1)  Labor and capital are separate.  Capital hires labor.\n2)  Labor works outside the home, capital can control things.<p>The second problem arises pretty clearly (and intractably) from the sort of worker protection laws that Belloc describes in ""The Servile State.""  I.e., by treating employees as the responsibility of the employer, you have serious issues regarding workers comp and so forth when an employee is working outside of an environment that the employer controls.<p>The example Belloc gives is this:<p>A farmer hires two men to dig a well.  The first is being lowered into the hole by the second and he lets the rope slip and the first worker is injured.  If all three were independent agents, the first worker's lawsuit would be against the second worker, but instead it is the employer who is responsible.  So this leads to an employer legally compelled to control the workplace.  Things like telecommuting are challenging this but only seem to work in certain narrow domains.<p>So a lot of kinds of work cannot be done in the home for this sort of reason.  This means that family life cannot be integrated with work life and therefore must be separate.<p>To me the answer is to recognize that a labor/capital divide in context with fundamental differences in the nature of motherhood and fatherhood, leads to economic discrimination against women.  If we recognize that, then we can challenge that divide and build a more just economy based on smaller units where work life and family life are not so separate.<p>So these are all pieces of a very complex cultural phenomenon.",1323738027

But they don&#x27;t really understand numbers or how this algorithm works.  And the bang numbers in and hope for the best.<p>Show them &quot;speed = distance / time&quot;, and give them distances and times and they&#x27;re fine.  Now given them some speeds and times and ask them to find distance and they&#x27;re stumped.<p>Math should be teaching children how to think, not just how to put numbers into a calculator.",1401555538

Certificate Transparency only makes the problem worse [1]. Browsers currently have no way to securely verify <i>either</i> self-signed <i>OR</i> CA-signed certificates.<p>- It&#x27;s the best security you can get because unlike certificates based on the aforementioned pay-for-insecurity &quot;X.509 PKI&quot; (public-key infrastructure), the security of a self-signed certificate depends on <i>NO ONE except the issuer (i.e. _you_)</i>. Plus, they are 100% free.<p>I like to refer to today&#x27;s X.509 PKI as &quot;the internet&#x27;s oldest backdoor&quot; (about two decades old now [2]), because browser vendors have been aware of this problem for quite some time now and haven so far chosen to either do nothing, or make the problem worse (like with Certificate Transparency [1]).<p>Aaron Swartz wrote in 2011 that the solution to this problem is to use the blockchain [3]. I spoke with him about this at the time [4] and today am working on a project to bring that vision to life [5].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/trans/current/msg00233.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/trans/current/msg00233....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2014-April/006482.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2014-April...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://okturtles.com/img/Aaron_Swartz_Email.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://okturtles.com/img/Aaron_Swartz_Email.jpg</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain</a>",1401554177

The cert allows you to put meaningful authentication on your site (otherwise passwords go in plaintext, for example).<p>For a medium security level, sufficient for online money transactions, you would have to get a higher-assurance type of cert - this requires more money, sending business and personal ID documents to verify your business to the CA, etc..<p>For really secret communications - getting into a degree of NSA-proofing - among other things you have to avoid involving a CA, and preferably make browser certificates for trusted clients, to spare them the warnings that browsers throw up on non-CA server certificates. This is unsuitable for (legal) commerce (commercial payment processors would reject your business), and still vulnerable to metadata collection (unless you put it on TOR or equivalent), and  still vulnerable to state coercion of private keys or forced code-trojaning.<p>Note that the third solution requires that your clients have a means of verifying that the site is yours rather than an imposter - you avoid a CA having the power to enable some other site to impersonate yours, but trusted users must have a basis for trust by a &quot;side channel&quot; such as knowing you personally, you being their employer, or reputation of your digital signature over time.",1401553951

Here are some of my reasons:<p>- I have a lot of opportunities to learn because there are so many people with diverse skills and expertise and Google has the resources and motivation to let people investigate novel technologies.<p>- I work with amazing technology. Google has the resources to devote many engineers to internal development tools and production technologies.<p>- I don&#x27;t have to work with (many) crazy people. At startups and small businesses, I found that one crazy founder or manager (who is probably related to the CEO) can completely ruin the experience. Google has processes to avoid hiring such people or to deal with them post-hire.<p>- The work I do effects a lot of people. My Mom has commented on features that I&#x27;ve implemented. And, since we usually work in small teams, my impact isn&#x27;t usually diluted by a lot of people.<p>- There is a lot of project diversity and ability to relocate (if you want). So far I&#x27;ve worked on Google&#x27;s support systems (Dublin), search (Dublin), App Engine (Sydney) and Chromecast (Mountain View).<p>- I get paid well without a lot of risk. At Google my base salary is pretty high and I can treat my bonus and equity awards as extras that I don&#x27;t need to count on.

7826381,comment,7825925,7825925,2,0,SonOfLilit,,,"In his “Intuitive Explanation of Bayes’ Theorem”, Eliezer Yudkovsky wrote:<p>It’s like the experiment in which you ask a second-grader: “If eighteen people get on a bus, and then seven more people get on the bus, how old is the bus driver?” Many second-graders will respond: “Twenty-five.” They understand when they’re being prompted to carry out a particular mental procedure, but they haven’t quite connected the procedure to reality.<p>I was awe-struck, so I asked a friend who sometimes teaches second-graders to try this. 11/18 wrote “25″, 5/18 wrote “25 passengers on the bus” and 2/18 returned a blank note.<p>I think this is a big part of the explanation. If you’re taught addition as a process that happens in a notebook, not in reality, then you have no way to separate answers that make sense from those that don’t. You also have no way to connect math to things you experience in your life, and I think the most common way to develop an interest in something is to find out it’s related to something else that you’re already interested in.<p>In the last Super Bowl, the Seattle Seahawks scored 8 points in the first quarter, and 14 in the second quarter.

(Yeah, it's not that much for > 100G HDD, still, it can be quite a lot for 4 or 8G SSD. Especially when it is completely useless for the computer.)<p>It's not different, because fatelf doesn't help with this. You can still make some tiny wrapper, and have completely the same thing. Vendor still have to make a package fit for your system, for the set of libraries that you have, correct versions of them, and so on. Yes, Mac OS X system has two or three recent different versions, mostly mutually compatible. If you were trying to make a package for only one or two mostly compatible Linux distributions and one or two of their versions, then it would be also that easy. But it is not, and fatelf doesn't make any difference.",1257418788

923643,comment,922872,923077,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>is it just me or is that not in fashion today</i><p>The advanced militaries of the world (British Army, USMC, IDF etc) are set up for maneuver warfare. This is what is known as third generation warfare (see William S Lind), and it has its roots in the Blitzkreig practiced by the Germans in WW2. When a third-generation military meets a second-generation military (one that thinks in terms of position-holding and massed formations) in a stand-up fight the result is always a rout (e.g. Six Day War, Gulf War 1, even Rommel virtually conquering France with a single armoured division). The Soviets knew this. Their genius strategy in WW2 was to force the Germans to fight in a second-generation style (and the Germans fell for it). This is also a major reason the Soviets were reluctant to enter Western Europe. All Western militaries thought very hard during the Cold War about how to defeat the Red Army, but the Prussians knew it all along.<p>Unfortunately the Taliban are a fourth-generation military (adept in psyops and propaganda, insurgency, guerilla tactics, information warfare) and the West is not well configured for that (and can't become so easily, as there are still second-generation potentials enemies around - we have to <i>think</i> in third-generation terms still).",1257418312

""Hi all — I’m serving up the first comment!<p>I’ve received about 6 comments from C# developers all giving me their take on a better version of the liquid-value code above. A couple of them using Linq, which simplifies the code substantially. I’ve taken a drastic step in deleting all those comments — sorry guys!!<p>Not because they didn’t present valid points, but because they entirely missed the point — I tried to spell it out with the K example — We’re discussing principles here, not code examples. I have no doubt that my rusty C# can be written in a more idiomatic sense, using better libraries etc. But thats much beside the point. The point is, that while the language so freely permits and even encourages me to code that way — I will end up seeing that type of code in my systems. If I had the privilege of hiring a team of superior geniuses and unspeakable coding skills, then sure, they might consistently produce rock solid functional code even in C# — but that’s not a real world scenario.<p>So lets stick with the principles. And if anybody does provide examples, please connect them with something discussed in the post. That makes for a better discussion than just swapping code.<p>Thanks to all for taking the time, sorry for being so harsh

The piece is a lot better than the title - author does realistic math on the range stock options are likely to be worth, then discusses whether it makes sense to jump into a risky venture with a chance of a big win, and talks about what to look for in more stable learning gigs if you're not going for a big win.

Content accessible to the public is not constrained by publishers anymore. If you're a big organization, people want to hear things from your employees directly and not from the usual boring PR channels, and they find a way to do so because it's so easy.<p>I believe companies have to embrace allowing their employees to communicate independently while making it clear that what they say is not the official position of the corporation. There's simply no other way, the age of controlled communication channels is just over. A good example is MSDN blogs - anyone at Microsoft can launch his or her blog and talk about whatever they want (except, of course, confidental information).",1257417345

Lisp is very, very nice, and while I may have a preference for it, someone else might not.  FWIW, MicroEmacs uses an in-house extension language that, while really repulsive to look at at times, gets the job done.<p>That said, I also have a preference for Lua when it comes to more maintream languages, and to boot, there's a project called LuaJIT that performs just-in-time compilation of Lua to native code.<p>There's also MetaLua, which adds the feature of macros to the language.<p>Better still, there's lua-Coat, which is a port of a subset of Moose from Perl (which is, in turn, a port of CLOS and other things to Perl) to Lua.<p>Consider also just using Python or Io or any number of other languages.<p>I guess my point is that it really doesn't depend on the language.  If the environment isn't going to be extensible within reason, I probably won't use it.<p>(Did you know that vim lacks the functionality to emulate Emacs' `create-frame`?

None of these languages is designed to make it easy to make a compiler/runtime that is from the ground up efficient. They are instead a rather inefficient interpreter with a really good library.

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it.<p>Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.<p>The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.

When treating red meat intake as a continuous variable, the elevated risk of total mortality in the pooled analysis for a 1-serving-per-day increase was 12% for total red meat, 13% for unprocessed red meat, and 20% for processed red meat.”</i><p>This is a calm, cautious, undramatic statement.<p>The problem is that risk is presented as a percentage, and most people have no idea what that means to their life expectancy; or how to compare that risk to other things.<p>Check my math, but I think the above figures mean a decrease of one year in life expectancy over 80 years.

More effort == more billable hours. You also have the chance to up-sell existing clients. It's a win-win all round if you have the skills to do it.<p>The current problem is persuading the client that a responsive design is worthwhile. I still regularly encounter folk who don't understand the number of folk looking at the web using mobiles - let alone the necessity to design something to work on a variety of displays and contexts.<p>This is getting easier as more people interact with the web with more devices. Once folk actually use two different kinds of device to look at stuff online selling responsive solutions becomes <i>much</i> simpler. When it gets to three or four it sells itself.",1333357442

But then Windows got much better with version 7 and Ubuntu took a nosedive into crazy UI fantasy land.<p>The final straw was when text started randomly disappearing and reappearing in emacs and xterms in Unity.  I don't know why it happened, just that it was too much trouble to diagnose some weird bug for the millionth time.  If I can't trust my desktop to run emacs(!) without glitching, see ya.<p>I'm getting older, and after about 15 years playing around with config files, I just want something that's stable and consistent, and OS X was never to my taste.

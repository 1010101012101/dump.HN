The immoral of the story is that in piracy the copyright holder loses money from the theft. In code theft, the immoral of the story is not that the holder loses money, but that the thief makes some illegitimaly. Both should probably be considered equally wrong<p>- The page was ""stolen and branded as their own"", but<p>a) only a tiny non-critical page of the product was copied, and<p>b)There was no way to pay the original creator for the reuse.<p>I too found the backlash disturbingly intense, given the previous relaxed laisez-faire attitude towards other people's IP in this forum.

I lead a team of app developers for my day job, and one client once sent us some code from a previous development house to troubleshoot.<p>The thing was polling for new data <i>every 15 seconds</i>. What was particularly surprising was the developer who had written it had quite a good reputation, and was highly though of - on the desktop. And perhaps that's the problem - that people are coming to mobile, writing apps and not considering that what's OK on the desktop is not going to fly on mobile.<p>(...before someone chimes in here: polling every 15 seconds on a mobile device is unacceptable if you're on a cellular network.

3525241,comment,3524008,3524199,2,0,darklajid,,,"At which point in the past did we establish that these wages are in _any_ way reasonable. We talk about a 'bubble' in our sector every other day. And you seem to imply (please, correct me if I missed the point) that these are 'market rates' and need to be payed by someone to get a decent end result. Which then kind of defends the existence of Hollywood as the one to make it happen.<p>I'd argue that this is turning the thing on its head. The Hollywood crowd overcharges from the position of a quasi monopoly that is protected by IP and copyright laws in most places of the world. They dictate the prices and are therefor able to sustain the costs of having to pay ridiculous (you can argue, but there's no way in hell I change my pov on this one) amounts of money to single persons for 'a project'.<p>Take away the quasi monopoly and yes, dear god: 200million+ might be a tad too much. But the market will adapt and we'll find awesome actors that are happy to do that job for 300.000 USD per year. Or less. No idea - let's find out.",1327845524

Which part of ""not suitable for cryptographic purposes"" did you not understand?<p>Neither FNV, Jenkins, Murmur <i>nor</i> this new City Hash are supposed to be used for cryptography.<p>Besides, the way one generally requires hash functions in cryptography, performance is the <i>least</i> of your worries (unless you're trying to crack), so there's no reason whatsoever not to go with a proper cryptographically strong hash such as SHA256.<p>That said, Jenkins has worse avalanche behaviour than FNV--though I'm sure with a few tweaks that could be fixed, non-crypto hash functions aren't exactly rocket science (check out where FNV's constants came from)--but as it is, Jenkins is more of an academic example.<p>Spooky (also developed by Bob Jenkins) seems better. Oddly enough Spooky claims 3 bytes per cycle, but the author cannot confirm CityHash's 6 bytes per cycle ( <a href=""http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html</a> ). Though whatever it is, both are obviously blazingly fast, picking one over the other because of performance reasons should only be done once you've established that the speed of the hashing function is indeed a bottleneck, and you can compare the performance on the specific hardware it's supposed to run on.",1327845193

That had a difference though: they were pressurising Elsevier to take specific courses of action.<p>In this case, it appears to be more of a ""we won't work for you because we don't respect your ethics"" stance. Which is fine, but they'll have to continue reading and <i>citing</i> articles in Elsevier journals in their work to be respected as academics.<p>Ultimately, the value of copyrights giving Elsevier exclusive control over access to thousands of existing ""must cite"" articles in searchable format means it would continue to be a profitable entity if it stopped publishing new material of comparable quality or any new material at all. It's a drop in profits I'm sure the Elsevier board would rather avoid, but the boycott doesn't seem to be offering them any more attractive alternatives.",1327844659

3525216,comment,3524819,3524819,1,0,SudarshanP,,,"Reading DNA without taking it out of a cell sounds like such an awesome idea. All you need is bunch of proteins to do that. All those proteins are just <i>DNA sequences</i>. possibly even Biobricks. So all that translates to ""Just introduce a plasmid into a cell and the necessary woodoo happens inside the cell... which sets off some kind of cascade which can be read out by say a CCD or voltage detector."" So the startup is all about just designing DNA sequences for protein. And these days even novices have begun to design proteins. This is just brilliant!!! Instead of 1000$ per genome how about 99 cents?? Of course I have no clue how long it should take to reach there beyond extrapolating on a log graph...<p>Someone here stated the moore's law for sequencing. Which while true needs disruptive startups for each transition. Fortunately or unfortunately these startups dont work like an intel doing similar drudgery year after year to continue doubling... each major leap happens by a radical switch of strategy. As he states the case of Ion Torrent, each step centers around an awesome breaktrhough. But it also raises the question... Will the cost of computation become a bottleneck for a 99 cent genome. Sequencing and synthesis are a lot more useful than just medical diagnosis. Let us not undermine the value of a 99 cent genome or a 1 cent genome sequencing/synthesis capability.",1327844448

I'm not here to comment on the article contents but on what happened to it here on HN.<p>When I opened HN it was as I mentioned #3.  I went and read the article, it was short, took about 90 seconds to read.  I came back to HN, refreshed the page to see if it had been voted on any more (as I intended to up-vote it) and bam, it was gone.  So I went looking for it...  found it at #136 with 12 votes and 2 comments.  So in 90 seconds it went from #3 to #136 despite extra upvotes. As of me finishing writing this it has 14 upvotes and has dropped to #137.<p>This isn't the first time I've seen this happen, and it's happened frequently enough that I'm starting to get curious.  Perhaps I notice it more as I do have a habit of refreshing the page after reading an article to see if it's trended any more in the meantime.  Can someone explain why this happens?

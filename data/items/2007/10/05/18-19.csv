Wait, the 'hackers' are the reason it's hard to provide, right?  So why the ""even harder to protect"" part?<p>Later there's the typical focus on stock price instead of market cap.  This is the ""ooh, shiny!"" school of business writing.<p>""This curbs the riskiest kind of hacking""  Please reduce hacking risk; wear a helmet.  <p>You know what this reminds me of?

They want your name and email just to download the software, then they want your name, email, age, phone number (for customer service ?!) they send you the email which went straight to my spam label in gmail and inform me that <p>""You will be receiving a series of emails offering\nInternet Safety Tips and other instructions on how to\nget the most benefits from your new Kid Safe Browser.""<p>Then to register as a parent they ask you for your name, street address email phone and whether you are over 18. <p>Then they want your childs birthday and your presented with this gem:<p>I give my permission for my child to receive email from Club Tuki via their e-mail account (without checking this box, you child will not be able to receive Auction Notification emails through our TUKI Moola auction site). <p>After that they did deliver as promised, I got an animated Miss America (think clippy) that tells me when sites are not on ""the master list""<p>If you want to close the browser you are informed that you have 30 days left on your trial before the premium features expire because it hijacks the close button and makes you read through a pop-up. It also leaves the taskbar up, so any kid smart enough to find start will be able to launch Firefox and surf where ever they want. It also starts at Club Tuki or some such where you can earn Tuki bucks by playing arcade games but I think there's a registration involved there too.<p>One thing this does the REAL kid friendly browser could clone... it has a banned words list which includes our first and last names so that would be nice (it also has an encouraging words list like ""My family loves me!"" and a chores list with I'm guessing chore reminder pop-ups, but I don't recommend implementing those features)<p>She does indeed say ""Buh-Bye!"" as promised though.",1191607872

I think Korea is behind Japan in these trends but catching up.<p>I do agree, though, that Japan does have a reputation of being not very inviting to foreigners that is to some degree deserved.  I don't know as much about S. Korea in this regard.<p>Japan could probably do much to solve some of their looming economic problems (low birth rate and rapidly aging population, for example) by allowing more people to immigrate and integrate into Japanese society and culture.  Especially entrepreneurial, technology loving types who could contribute a lot to Japan's high tech economy.",1191607815

4966764,comment,4965868,4965868,8,0,duopixel,,,"I worked in the online booking industry for a couple of years, coincidentally I also live in Playa del Carmen now.<p>What most likely happened was this: Expedia and other big players buy wholesale room inventory from large hotel chains. Expedia might come up and say that they want to buy 30% of the rooms of a hotel for a certain period at a steeply discounted price.<p>This might be something that the hotel itself can't fill, so the happily sell to Expedia et al. To Expedia, selling these rooms might be something like 80% profit, against 25% for a small hotel such as the Luna Blue.<p>Expedia then promotes the hell out of the hotel through their website: they make it appear on top of search results, they ""pimp"" they profile of the hotel, and such. They are not allowed to undercut the price, because other retailers might ask for the same price.<p>Then, the office managers of Expedia Cancn are most likely on some sort of incentive to sell most of these wholesale rooms (travel is dominated by such economic incentives). The hack is is pretty clear: ""closing"" smaller hotels causes users to book another hotel, and it will most likely be one of these pimped out hotel profiles that provide much more profit than other hotels.<p>I'm guessing this is a regional issue, just some dim witted office managers at Cancn that are trying to game the system in order to get a big incentive.",1356461920

If you're booking off-season at the last minute, I've found discounts on hotels.com of 40-60% relative to what the online-booking system of the hotel's own website was showing. One example where I've stayed a few times (<a href=""http://www.hotel-maritime.dk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hotel-maritime.dk/</a>) was offering 50/night via hotels.com in late January 2012, at a time when their own website was listing 80/night.

4966735,comment,4963914,4966561,2,0,syedkarim,,,"This is my suggestion: 
1. Find many people who want to invest in these markets. You don't really need many people, but you do need a good bit of cash. The only way to make this work is by having a portfolio approach; it's extraordinarily difficult to pick individual winners. Let's say you (the investor collective) are investing $50,000 per company. My advice is to invest in at least 10 companies.<p>2. Find a local subject matter expert; someone who is plugged into the startup community and understands what the context is like. This person may need to get paid, but not much (it's a limited amount of work). You really should have a contact in each local market (not that hard to find).<p>3. Set up weekly calls with your collective and assign individuals specific verticals to monitor/research. For example, you take e-commerce, your friend takes UGC, and a third person takes marketplaces; similar to the way that conventional fund operates.<p>4. Find local counsel--even if you insist that the companies be re-incorporated in Delaware.<p>5. Schedule monthly calls to go over deal flow. Spend more time (virtually is fine) with those companies that receive approval from the collective. Make sure you have had enough time to verify that the founders do what they say they do. Look at traction and budget.<p>6. Review the docs and disburse funds. Monitor the investment.<p>As you can see, it's not a complicated process, but it does take time and energy. Do you have that (as well as sufficient capital to put at risk)?",1356461506

4966730,comment,4965997,4965997,1,0,virtualritz,,,"The probable reasons this app failed, and any app that competes with PS will (regardless of how well it tackles the resolution independence/feedback speed issue): are two things:<p>1. Workflow must match PS 1:1 for the majority of everyday image editing operations.
People that use PS are mostly creative folks who do no understand image editing from a technical perspective. Solving a problem (a use case) to them means to internalize a workflow.
Mastering a 'deep' app like PS this way takes years.
If you write a competitor to PS and dont honor this experience that took your target users years, often over a decade to aquire, you're shooting yourself in the foot too hard to ever gain enough momentum on a market that is dominated by PS (resp. its users).<p>This is imho also the reason why Adobe hasn't touched basic workflow in PS, <i>ever</i>. Because if they did this, they risked alienating users and driving them to test a competitor's product.
Recall when Apple 'improved' the UI/workflow of FinalCut Pro? The screams of outrage echoing through the web? :)<p>2. Feature set must be more or less identical to PS. You can 'plus' in some areas but you can't 'minus'.
If you have a use case that is not covered by your app but by PS and it is even used by the average target user only once a week in PS, this will be enough reason for them to not consider your app a worthwhile alternative, even if you do get 1. right.<p>1. is not too hard to do, engineering wise. But 2. is a huge task. PS simply has <i>a lot</i> of features.",1356461409

In order to gain the discipline I need to reach my full potential, I want to engage in an institution(s) that will help me instill the discipline I need to succeed, ideally for a year, although I am definitely open to shorter/longer options. I have read a bit about Hacker School and feel like it is a great fit for me, so I plan to apply for it, but I am in dire need of suggestions (other than finish college. not my cup of tea.) I'm open to anything, job, internship, program, camp, etc. Thank you for taking the time to consider this, I really appreciate it.</code></pre>",1356461171

I'm a techie by trade (if not by nature), working on a startup and we don't have a dedicated ""marketing guy"" so I need to learn enough to get us off the ground at least. Luckily I actually find this stuff interesting, and I did a lot of studying on marketing stuff in 2012 (Chet Holmes FTW)<p>2. Sales.  See above.  We don't have a sales guy, so I need enough sales knowledge to at least get that first push going.<p>3. Influence / persuasion.  Always good stuff to have in the repertoire.<p>4. More and more diving into ""big data"" / ""data science"" stuff.<p>5. More on NLP, ""text mining"" and information retrieval.<p>6. In addition to the aforementioned Scala and Clojure, I have a goal of learning some R and Prolog as well. Haskell would be nice as well.<p>7. Lockpicking. I learned the basics last year, but I need to practice more.  I want to get a lot better.<p>8. Electronics / hardware hacking.  I got into the Arduino scene a while back and started doing more low level electronics stuff in conjunction with that, and I'd like to continue down that path.<p>9. Physical fabrication stuff.

Why pre-suppose that 2 per year is an acceptable norm, that is not problematic in itself?<p>Consider a US with a mean value of 10,000 mass shootings per year, with the occasional 0, 20.000 or 50,000 etc mass shootings fitting the poisson distribution.

As they say, there are lies, damned lies, and statistics.<p>As an extreme example, in a country where there are no guns (either legal or illegal), there would be no mass shootings AT ALL. No ""spontaneous random activity"" pertaining to mass shootings could change that.<p>In a similar, but more practical way, if other western countries have a median of about 0 mass shootings per year for decades (with the occasional exception), this tells us that even if the number of mass shootings per year in the US is random, the fact that it has mass shooting at all is not random but a cultural/structural result.",1356460463

However, the OTA must really help both parties, and resolve any disputes, instead of washing their hands off it and saying they're just a messenger confirming the booking. There's little value in an OTA that only provides booking confirmation and that's it.<p>As far as I'm aware airbnb has made a lot of progress in this very area, verifying photos and information posted, checking the identities of the guests, that helps protecting both the host and the guest.

4966641,comment,4965997,4966157,2,0,virtualritz,,,"I dunno how this particular app worked but there is this thing called ""deferred processing"".<p>The thing to realize is that the max resolution I can ever see on screen is the resolution of that screen I am working on.<p>Even a retina MacBookPro has only 4 Mpixels on screen, at any time.
Now lets say I am painting a mask on a 30 Mpixel medium format image with a brush of 500 pixel diameter.
Lets say I am zoomed out, so the image is displayed filling the entire screen. This requires a zoom level of 13% for the retina example.
That means I only have to paint with a brush of 67 pixels diameter on a 4 Mpixel image in realtime and record the stroke!
Because the brush path is recorded, the brush is resolution independent. That is what the claim refers to, no to the source material.<p>When I zoom into such a 30 Mpixel image, to better see what I am doing, the area visible on screen remains 4 Mpixel. Many image editing apps (or most) completely ignore this.<p>What's more, while I am working, I do not have to use sub-pixel precision when blitting brushes onto the image )or doing whatever else) because this level of precision, in general, but specificially when editing, is almost always irrelevant at that high resolution.<p>Memory wise, too, I don't ever have to hold (many layers) of 30 Mpixel res in ram.
When a user loads an image, I build a pyramid (a mip map) dump that to disk and load tiles into a cache, as I go.<p>This never changes. When I have finished my 6 hour editing session, I press 'render' and everything is carried out, at 30 MPixel res. and subpixel precision. This render may then take an hour, but I don't care, I can go to bed and deliver the result to the client the next day.<p>When I do this in Photoshop, everything is always done at full res, with full subpixel precision. Ok, since a few years PS, too, uses a pyramid (mip mapping) in RAM, but it is far from optimal.<p>That is the reason why Photoshop's speed always sucks (because as hardware specs increase, so does the res. and number of layer people use when editing images).<p>It always uses too much RAM and too much CPU because it carries out a shitload of stuff you can't ever see until the final image is used in print or you zoom in at 1:1 and pan the entire image. Two things that, together, almost never happen in image editing.<p>P.S.: the only acceptable minimal bitdepth for image editing is 16bits/component float (linear space). Anything else will compromise quality, one way or the other.<p>P.P.S.: I was the product manager for Eclipse after Alias/XYVision sold it to Form & Vision in 1998. AMA. :)",1356460321

4966625,comment,4954894,4955930,1,0,jenius,,,"Yes, I thought you would probably take some offense at it (which you clearly did), which is why I said ""I mean it in the least offensive way possible"". I have nothing against you personally, and frankly I'm sure you are a wonderful person. I just strongly disagreed with your critiques in this particular subject.<p>As a response, I'll say this: you're right about design being subjective. This is something I tend to consider common knowledge, and when one says that a design (or anything subjective, like a song) is 'better' or 'worse', you must assume this means that the majority of people would judge it as such. I can promise you that things are popular for a reason, whether you personally think so or not.<p>However, this 'majority rule' is not the singular and sole influence - often times experts or tastemakers can influence how 'good' something is perceived to be. Great examples of this are modern art and wine -- the overwhelming majority of people do not have sophisticated taste in these two areas, so they often allow themselves to be guided by experts who have dedicated a lot of time and study to the area. And this makes sense, no?<p>So let's think about how you can figure out if you have good taste or not in an area. If you find that your taste often aligns with <i>both</i> those who have experience and training, and the majority of normal people, whether or not you have expertise yourself, it's likely that your taste in this area is good. On the other hand, if you find it to be quite the opposite, it's likely that your taste isn't so good. Again, it doesn't matter here whether you an expert or not, although the more expertise you have, the more likely it is that your taste will 'improve'. If the masses and experts are at odds, although this doesn't happen super often, I'd be more likely to side with those with training, but that's just a personal opinion.<p>This is nothing really to take too personally. I find that I have terrible taste in movies, for example. Most movies that critics like and that are popular with my friends and the masses, I really don't like very much. And that's fine, I just accept it, move on, and know that I'm not going to be writing movie critiques any time soon, since I don't have good taste in movies. I don't write poor quality movie reviews anyway, then rage on anyone who tells me that my taste in movies isn't so good. That's some American Idol shit right there.<p>There's no arrogance or elitism here, it's self-awareness. I made this comment about you rather than the contents of the comment because the the comment you wrote is about you, not the contents of your comment. It's about this -- what we're talking about: subjective critiques, how valid they are, and how they can be backed up. You are arguing against both (many) trained designers and heavily up-voted items -- don't you think that means anything?<p>I would like to truly apologize for the extent that I offended you with this comment though, I really honestly didn't mean for it to go over quite so poorly as it did. You don't seem to draw any difference between the two, but intentions and results are different things, really. And my intention was (and still is) not to incite anger, just to discuss.<p>Also, I agree that the type on roots needs a little bit more contrast, other people (both designers and non-designers) have mentioned this as well. I'll be making that change soon : )",1356460050

I think the enormous user base prevents them from changing the interface.  That's probably a good thing, even if the interface is sub-optimal.<p>AutoCAD has a very powerful interface, with a mix of WIMP and typed commands, with some scripting.<p>In theory GIMP being open source means anyone can give it a new interface, but even though the interface is one of the biggest reasons many people give for not liking the GIMP there are few projects that have given it a saner interface.",1356459396

Work through it as a checklist, clicking the box next to each step as you do them. We've found that works really well with people.<p>The two big things in my opinion, as you start out, are:<p>* Find a project that you care about. Otherwise, you'll lose momentum. It's cool that you want to work on Mozilla-y projects! My only warning is that the long build time means you are going to have to plan to wait a while (about 1 hour) between downloading the code and actually running your local build.<p>* Find a task that is doable, so you can actually get it fixed, and you actually enjoy it!<p>Some things to watch out for:<p>* The build process could be super slow, for big projects like Firefox.<p>* Eventually you're going to have to get used to navigating enormous projects. This might sound daunting, but actually I think you'll find it fun after a bit.<p>* Make sure you have a place where you can reach out and get help. You'll probably be running into all sorts of new things -- version control tools, patch submission guidelines, an enormous codebase -- and you're more likely going to have a good time if you can get your questions answered.<p>For that last one, feel mega free to join #openhatch via IRC on freenode.net (more info on that here if you don't know IRC -- <a href=""https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/JHU/Laptop_setup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/JHU/L...</a> ).

At first I was pretty amazed in finding out that Italy (which also happens to be the country where I am from) gave a strong contribution to type design during Renaissance. However my purpose of reading wasn't about history. It was about going less random when having to choose a font from a set for a presentation or a website. At least having in mind what are the basic rules to follow when mixing type and setting paragraphs. This is what the second and third part of the book deal with and I would say that the book helped me to get acquainted with that altought much of the experience comes with practice and further reading.<p>For what concerns the book about color the main reasons for reading it were that I wanted to know what color fit well together and even though I am at 75% of the book I would say that I am still not 100% satisfied with the book because it lacks a bit of exercises for the reader.
So far I particularly appreciate the highlights at the end of each chapter and the part of the book dedicated to light<p>Since Illustrator is a great playground for color and type I thought to give it a try. As it appears a bit complicated at first sight I decided to 
If you already have some web design technical background this book flows very fast and I would recommend it together with vector tuts for getting your hands on illustrator in a fast way.<p>I have been eating a lot of information since I got online. 
I have 1000+ RSS feeds, 1000+ facebook pages and 500+ followed people on twitter, 1000+ subscription to newsletter which crowd my inbox.
But what is really important to me?
The Information Diet gives a framework for healthy information consumption by comparing information consumption to food consumption. The gist is that you should consume more information from the source and less from re-posting content factories which chase the synonyms just to get better SEO ranking.
What I particularly didn't like about the book is that the author has been writing too much about American politics as an example. As a non-american I would have preferred more international topics. But I must admit that politics is a good example to get concept like self reinforcement of your own truth across.<p>In Gamification by Design I got some best practices for design patterns that make websites more stimulating for the user to participate.
The best concept I got were: walk the user throught all the steps from beginner to master, useful stuff to do this are leaderboards and badges. 
The book however is a bit of advertisement for ruby on rails and badgeville.<p>Last but not least Enterprise Games: Using Game Mechanics to Build a Better Business has a lot of concepts which are probably already known to a web designer but not to a manager in a manufacturing enterprise but is still a good way to get started with gamification for people who don't have an extensive experience with online tools.<p>Hope you will find my comments useful.

We're just in the process of trying to sort out a dispute with a hotel we booked via booking.com. It doesn't feel like it's booking.com's problem, but rather ours. We were essentially forced to pay for full 7 nights even though we stayed only one, after it wasn't possible to stay any longer with a non-functioning toilet. Not to mention false information published on booking.com.<p><pre><code>    > or make sure you have somewhere else to stay because you're now their customer
</code></pre>
That's interesting. In our case booking.com has never offered any such help. We went by ourselves to try to find alternative accommodation. Not that it makes a huge difference, but it is our honeymoon so I'm sure yo'd agree there are many better ways to spend it...<p>So far you guys are trying to help, but I can't say that the problem is resolved or that it feels like you're treating it as your problem. To quote a part of the latest email from booking.com on this:<p><i>> ... the hotels themselves are responsible for all the information provided to you. Booking.com acts as an intermediary between the guest and the hotel and is therefore responsible for delivering the reservation correctly to the hotel. Once the hotel has confirmed the reservation it then becomes their responsibility to accommodate the guests.</i>",1356458479

For instance it makes sense for me to control access to things like my glasses, bike, pajamas, etc. Property rights work pretty well for defining that arrangement.<p>At the other extreme, we have situations where property rights can be overridden, such as taxation and eminent domain, and entities whose value depends on a stable money system provided by the government -- I see no a priori reason why the workable way to manage those things is not through a system of <i>limited</i> property rights. In broad terms, one such limitation is an agreement that taxation is not a violation of a fundamental human right.<p>The more abstract and artificial &quot;property&quot; gets, the more reasonable that property rights are balanced against other things, such as redistribution.<p><i>This is the core of our system. And that system will always generate inequality.</i><p>Sure, and to the extent that it works, it&#x27;s OK. When it doesn&#x27;t work, then it seems reasonable to manage it in order to make it work better. Some broad-brush ideas are for the government to provide a functioning money system, and a way to redistribute wealth against the tide of inequality.",1451782749

And its not like the oligopoly is not trying - why are there so many appeals for more H1Bs?<p>If you need skilled workers and the varying skill of a worker produces magnitudes of difference in wealth created of course you need to both be huge enough to afford them and centralized enough to take advantage of them.<p>The article itself seems like a blinders on interpretation of the US tech industry. Corporate consolidation is at all time highs in areas like food processing, farming, finance, raw materials, and industry. Mom and pop shops the world over are bellying up for Walmart and Starbucks. Startups and creative culture in the tech bubble are against the general grain. Its why money in politics is being considered such a larger problem now than twenty years ago - as dozens of economic effects interact, from people having less spending money to companies consolidating and having guaranteed revenues to regulatory meddling in their favor.<p>Fundamentally I think that newer generations growing up on the Internet are turning out <i>much</i> more hive minded than their grandparents, because there are just more of them as a fraction of the population. The perfect white nuclear family of 1970 still only accounted for a stark minority of the American public - it is just strange that a disproportionate number of people on HN ended up coming from that class. There was still extreme social unrest throughout the century - prison camps for the Japanese, the KKK, segregation, and the banning of many chemicals due to being &quot;foreign&quot; like opium and marijuana.

10828927,comment,10826836,10826836,0,0,jcfrei,,,"While the article is rather long and touches on many subjects, I believe I agree with the underlying sentiment. Namely, that income inequality is rising and social cohesion is eroding (whereby the former is largely responsible for the latter in my opinion). Looking at historical income inequality in the US, we see that it&#x27;s just returning to pre 20th century levels. This is not surprising, since the 20th appears to be at odds in many ways with other centuries. Especially the rise of the middle-class (which quickly was understood as a society&#x27;s default state) seems like a purely 20th century phenomenon. The real question is whether societies in developed countries will accept a return back to more divisive wealth distributions (where people are either clearly upper or clearly lower class).<p>Furthermore I think it&#x27;s very important to differentiate between total wealth and wealth distribution. Some (probably rather right-wing politicians) advocate total wealth creation and others (rather left-wing politicians) promote (equal) wealth distribution. Economically speaking the former is clearly preferable, while for social cohesion the later is clearly preferable. Which way we go is (hopefully) up to the democratic electorate (ie. you). And should that not be the case, then at the very least we can all agree that fixing the democratic (legislative) process must be our very first priority - no matter if you seek more or less taxation.",1451782613

Small businesses are in fact still losing ground and importance to larger businesses (see for example <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/running_small_business/Small%20Business%20GDP.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/running_small_business/...</a>). What definitely is happening compared to the mid 20th C is that the economy is more complex and thus there are more diverse industries represented in government, and also the lifespan of large companies is reduced, particularly as technology advances faster now than ever before. Jobs are also becoming ever more centralised in cities due to their increased need for direct communication which hasn&#x27;t been countered by technology yet (despite a minor trend for remote work). These are the major trends for me.<p>I&#x27;d also add that while networks of smaller companies may have some innovation advantage over large companies (depending on the industry and innovation), many are focussed on industries where they can reduce labour rights, safety standards, avoid tax and lower wages e.g. in construction industry subcontracting, clothing manufacturing, hardware manufacturing, etc.)<p>Whats also glossed over here is the advances to society made through mechanisms which aren&#x27;t people trying to get rich, or seek a &#x27;market price&#x27; for their &#x27;wealth creation&#x27;. Lets not forget that most of the true computer pioneers were people in the corner of some university or military institution somewhere. Similarly in medicine and most sciences, research which is not profit-driven has been core to much of the &#x27;wealth&#x27; of the 20th century across the world.",1451782538

I still disagree with a bit of it, but I don&#x27;t like shutting off others&#x27; ideas due to my biases[0]. You make an interesting point though, the idea of how wealth is distributed after does have an underlying value judgement,  as you point out.<p>To be fair to pg, he is responding to an often used argument that assumes wealth is a zero sum game rather than it being who gets more of the wealth created. He is right then to claim that given his values (and those shared by most people in America, remember, we still are center-right on most things) and within that moral framework where ownership determines who reaps the benefits, his logic is correct. However, with your values where it seems that benefits should go to those who invest more[1] should earn a proportional amount, it may be suspect.<p>[0] At least the ones I can identify.<p>[1] On second thought, many in America would agree this is a worthy moral framework.

I certainly think that there are some broader problems to be solved which involve how one deals with investigation into a domain that appears to be reflexive. &quot;Consciousness&quot; is a valid domain of investigation, but the question to ask becomes &quot;Can we come to an agreement over how to distinguish what we are investigating?&quot; Additionally, can we really call consciousness an &quot;object&quot; of investigation? The problem is that we, the subject, are investigating an object, which is us, the subject. It seems like there is some analogue of the subject-object problem that injects itself into the situation at that point.<p>The investigation of consciousness (among other things) becomes muddled when the majority of participants in the discourse can&#x27;t stabilize on how to actually \ndistinguish or demarcate consciousness as an object of investigation - that problem is tangled because the act of explaining consciousness presupposes consciousness.<p>Similarly, we must use the condition of living in order to explain life, and we must use the condition of &quot;being embedded in language&quot; in order to describe language. \nOne cannot escape those systems in their attempts to describe them. A scientist&#x27;s description of consciousness must necessarily account for the process by which he describes it.<p>But this isn&#x27;t anything too radical or new.

10828910,comment,10826838,10826944,0,0,questerzen,,,"There are two separate issues here and it is important to distinguish them clearly. \nPG is correct that there are two basic strategies for making money: rent and productivity.\n1) rent, although it has a positive aspect (it helps to efficiently allocate scarce resources to where they are most valuable and provides an incentive to add scarce resources to the economy), provides an inherent redistribution of wealth which makes owners of capital richer at the expense of non-owners. Piketty etc. have noticed that capital owners have recently been able to gain a greater share of wealth. This is socially and morally a bad thing, especially when it keeps non-capital owners in a state of relative poverty. \n2) productivity, in general, is more positive because it provides a net gain to the whole economy as PG points out. If the incentives to a small number of people are very high for adding productivity, then there is no particular problem with this. So in this sense PG is correct. \nHowever, this is largely irrelevant as the main problem is that productivity gains are predominantly going to NEITHER workers NOR entrepreneurs. Rather they are going to existing owners of capital. The biggest problem with massive wealth accumulation by founders isn&#x27;t whether it was deserved, but that when people stop being productivity enhancers they become capital owners and CONTINUE to earn wealth excessively not due to further productivity gains but through rent.\nThere are many solutions possible, but none of the sensible ones would affect new founders very much. PG can sleep easily on this account. \nThe reason PG should feel &quot;hunted&quot; is not that he is a founder enjoying the rewards for benefits he has provided to society, but that as a successful former founder and now capital owner he is continuing to gain excessive wealth by extracting rent from his YC investments such as AirBnB, and even worse, helping PASSIVE YC investors to capture that rent also.",1451782341

I don&#x27;t mean to say that it&#x27;s all VC&#x27;s fault - I just want to make a point about how VCs can make a poor person&#x27;s life difficult.<p>About 6 years ago, before Weebly came out, I was working on an open source drag-and-drop (user-friendly) content management system - I had spent 2 years on it (all my spare time) - \nI intended to offer it as a service eventually. Then I found out about Weebly (who got funded by YCombinator) - They had a huge well-funded team and so they were able to quickly develop a great product and they got massive traction. To be fair there were other competitors in the space, but they also had lots of funding - I decided that without funding, I could not compete with these products (in that space) and I so ended up just giving up my 2 year project.<p>Then I started working on a new open source project (3 years ago); in the area of realtime data; my plan was to build a tool which would improve how data is transferred between the database and the frontend client.\nUnlike my last attempt, this time, my open source project got a lot of traction; I later found out about Meteor (YC), then later Firebase (YC)...\nI&#x27;m still working on this new open source project though; I have decided to keep working on it forever (or until it becomes completely outdated) I intend to turn it into a service - I feel that no matter what I do, some great company will come out of YC to make all my work economically meaningless so I might as well keep going.<p>Basically YC is just churning out competition and putting huge amounts of money behind them. It&#x27;s taking opportunities away from the poor, hard working engineers and giving them to the few lucky ones who happen to be selected by YC.<p>It&#x27;s not just YC though, it&#x27;s VC in general; the huge amount of funding that they give out creates an artificial barrier of entry for newcomers.<p>Basically the idea is that if you don&#x27;t have a good social network, you cannot raise funding and if you cannot raise funding, you cannot succeed. If VC funding didn&#x27;t exist, the system would be a lot fairer.<p>I think YC does select good founders, but they miss a lot of really good ones too and these suffer greatly.<p>If you&#x27;re an investor, you should be mindful that for every investment you make, you&#x27;re probably hurting someone else somewhere in the world - So make sure you&#x27;re investing in the best of people (not just your friends).",1451782173

Under the new rules, merchants that don’t have the technology to accept chip cards will assume full liability for the cost of fraud from purchases in which the customer presented a chip-enabled card.<p>But those rules don’t apply to fuel stations in the United States until October 2017, and a great many stations won’t meet that deadline, said Verifone’s Turner.\n----<p>According to &quot;Yearbook 2005: British Retail Consortium&quot; [1], by the time of the liability shift (1 January 2005) &quot;retailers accounting for 75% of transactions&quot; had a chip+PIN terminal, with the remainder &quot;well on the way&quot;.

Given that the welfare state takes money from people and redistributes it to others by force, as the &quot;others&quot; grow larger due to immigration, people start to hate on immigrants for shrinking the part of the pie they think they deserve (even if the welfare state is responsible for more people being on welfare, not immigrants). A huge welfare state also discourages many people from working, making it more difficult for immigrants to integrate like they used to and creating tensions and resentment from the part of the population that works and the one that does not. This is why most Muslims in the US are well integrated while in Europe they are pushed into ghettos and victim of racism.

Most of which is currently flowing into real estate, powering various bubbles around the world.<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example: from what I understand, Larry Ellison doesn&#x27;t actually sell his stock in order to buy islands.  He uses it as collateral to secure a loan.  Those loans (something like 10 billion dollars worth at this point) can be spent/invested/leveraged, but it&#x27;s not directly taxable because it&#x27;s a loan.  That&#x27;s the kind of thing that you can do when you have a few billion.  You don&#x27;t even have to spend your own money.  The net increase in the value of his real estate holdings is more than enough to pay the interest.

If the stock doubles, Apple doesn&#x27;t get that money.  Indirectly, of course Apple does issue stock as bonuses to employees, and buys back stock to return cash to investors.

The developers have done an excellent job at maintaining the balance of the game and not pushing any outlandish changes. (After all, the game thrives on a nostalgia factor.) However, it&#x27;s apparent that it comes from a tiny dev studio. Releases are usually littered with bugs and playability issues. This is a great shame, because they manage to garner significant hype and excitement, only for the release day to be somewhat frustrating for most players.<p>* In fact, due to the small size of the dev team, there usually is a long turnaround period on fixing smaller gameplay issues. This means that most of the more invested players, who are more easily irritated than the casual players, use other, older, more established clients to play the game, where the new expansions are not available. Indeed, the new expansions, while very similar in spirit to the 13-year-old expansions, change the metagame so significantly that at the competitive level, only the 13-year old expansion is played. This deeply fragments the player base. The new expansions, and AoE2 on Steam in general, are mostly played by newcomers.<p>* It&#x27;s very difficult to get the advanced players to take the expansions seriously because the competitive scene has been basically unchanged for about fifteen years. As such, the theoretical metagame has been nearly perfected, and the random components in game generation do not make a difference to the point of needing true <i>improvisational</i> play. Competitive players have spent months, if not years, carefully practicing minutely differing iterations of the same game scenarios. I&#x27;ve seen professional players end games over early-game mistakes that an intermediate player might not even notice. I consider it a little similar to chess, in the sense that the metagame/opening theory is so well explored that the game can rarely be considered improvisational, but is more like a ballet performance: an extremely well-studied routine that has to be executed as perfectly as possible (which, by the way, means above 400 actions per minute for a top player). Considering the immense amount of study that has gone into the game, and the even larger amount of practice required to become truly good, it is clear that most competitive players would rather keep spending their time on the old game, as opposed to on the new expansions -- the latter would necessitate a great amount of exploration of new strategies, and a similarly enormous amount of practice.",1451779380

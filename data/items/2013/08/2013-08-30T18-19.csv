6303517,comment,6302773,6303466,8,0,cobrausn,,,"The whole thing as a system requires it to &#x27;police&#x27; itself internally, because we don&#x27;t have enough information to be able to do it effectively (i.e., file lawsuits with 100% accuracy).  I&#x27;ll say it again - when a case review finds withheld evidence that led to a wrongful conviction, this should lead to immediate criminal charges from within the system - no lawsuit should have to be filed from the victim.  If it was unintentional, let the jury decide.  This is how the rest of us get treated.<p>I disagree that this is simple cost-benefit analysis.  This is about the integrity and trustworthiness of the system, and it&#x27;s not worth writing off a whole bunch of people to make the wheels squeak less and clean up easier when they grind up an innocent person&#x27;s life.  It needs pressure from the outside to reform itself from within.<p>EDIT:<p>I guess I&#x27;m asking for the justice system to do a better job policing itself and start treating transgressions like this as major offenses that threaten the system itself.

I&#x27;ve seen companies like square and level up succeed at selling payment systems to small businesses near me. Is anyone in the HN community aware of a company trying to do something similar for small print shops?
I&#x27;ll make up an example company, LocalPrint, to give an idea of what I have in mind. LocalPrint would provide print shops with an out the box way to connect a printer to their cloud printing service, perhaps the hardware and printer would be  included to simplify configuration and enable other businesses like cafes to providing cloud printing capabilities. LocalPrint would also build software that enables users to print through their service from a variety of platforms and pay in advance using services like paypal and google wallet. LocalPrint could then generate revenue by charging a few additional cents for each print job.",1377888145

You&#x27;ll also want to fail the check if the time value read is less than the one stored (indicates overflow or other tampering, and overflows <i>should</i> be far enough apart that this will never happen).

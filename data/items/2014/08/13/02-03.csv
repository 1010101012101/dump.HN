8171152,comment,8170318,8170864,2,0,ixwt,,,"> This is no different than big companies hiring unpaid interns. Sure it can kinda work in a handful of cases, but it&#x27;s harmful to exploit people to perform unpaid labor.<p>There was a set of rules that came from a court ruling regarding unpaid internships[0]. I would like to go over the points here. These rules dictate whether an intern can go unpaid or not:<p>> 1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment;<p>Your intern can&#x27;t be a coffee jockey for you. They have to actually learn things from the job. In this case, I believe this is <i>more</i> than can be gained from an educational environment. This involved many more intricate details, and probably a bunch of analysis of the patents at hand. I imagine they were trying to pick apart this patent.<p>> 2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;<p>This experience was beneficial for both parties.<p>> 3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;<p>Unless the startup had a legal team that they didn&#x27;t use, I feel this is self evident.<p>> 4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;<p>While the startup did obtain an advantage (having a legal team), if the clinic team had failed, there is a very good chance they would have been greatly impeded.<p>> 5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship;<p>I highly doubt that any of the team got immediately hired, or were promised a job at the end of the internship.<p>> 6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.<p>They had come to an agreement that the students would be working for the clinic pro bono.<p>I feel that all of these points were met, and in this case there was no exploitation of unpaid labor. Both sides benefited greatly from this.<p>> But, the reality of the situation is there are massively degenerate patent laws at work here and the solution isn&#x27;t for startups to expect a contingent of students to work there buts off gratis for them.<p>You&#x27;re right. But I don&#x27;t see any other solutions right now. There isn&#x27;t any drastic reform bill being pushed through Congress. There aren&#x27;t any big companies standing up to these patent trolls, in fact most have given in. There was a patent troll going around suing companies for shopping cart technologies. Amazon and several others gave in, but Newegg finally stood up and denied them a settlment. Newegg went on to win the court case. They have won several others as well. Given the recent rulings of passing court fees on to patent trolls, I imagine they are getting less complaints in the long run than others that have given in.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/the-court-ruling-that-could-end-unpaid-internships-for-good/276795/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/the-cour...</a>",1407896123

That was only proven 30+ years later by Ives–Stilwell.<p>You&#x27;re registering agreement with my point. Or didn&#x27;t you notice?

It isn&#x27;t.<p>Notwithstanding its popular name, string theory is not a scientific theory, it&#x27;s a conjecture without an empirical basis.<p>> Science observes, formulates hypotheses, and then falsifies or shows them to be true.<p>Yes to the first, no to the second. Science never proves anything true, only false. This idea was perhaps best expressed by philosopher David Hume, who said, &quot;No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion.&quot;<p>> The &quot;linked artice&quot; is journalism, not science.<p>So science journalism is free from the responsibilities of science itself? If that were true,  it wouldn&#x27;t be either possible or responsible to call it science journalism.<p>> Ah. You digested 35 years of research, and found no evidence? Or you skimmed the overview I provided, and chose to not further investigate?<p>There is no demonstrated cause-effect relationship, it&#x27;s a correlation. If there were evidence for a cause-effect relaitonship, it would have been included even in the popular accounts.<p>> You didn&#x27;t read any of the papers, did you?<p>This is what you think constitutes scientific debate? If the evidence existed, you would be linking to it rather than arguing in bad faith.<p>> Yes, there is no clear mechanism, yet. That&#x27;s because we don&#x27;t understand psychology well enough to always define clear mechanisms. That&#x27;s what science is about - furthering our understanding.<p>Psychology isn&#x27;t science, and until it tries to explain what it has until now merely described, that status won&#x27;t change.<p>> The metastudies indicate that research is doing a decent job to control for other factors, and still reproduces nicely.<p>If reproducing unexplained results constituted science, astrology would be a science.",1407896023

All people, even black teenagers.<p>I think that every time a police officer fails in that simple duty so badly that they actually kill one of the people they are supposed to protect, that there <i>needs</i> to be an assumption of guilt and failure on the part of the police.<p>I think that if we don&#x27;t do that, if it becomes accepted that the police can occasionally kill people as part of their job, that we lose sight of what we have a police force for.<p>I think that being a police officer is hard because they have to deal with bad people without insulting them, restricting their rights or hurting them. The reward for doing this job right is the respect and co-operation of the community they protect. The penalty for not doing this job right is the loss of that respect and co-operation.<p>So I think whatever happens at the trial is irrelevant. The police failed here, and have lost the respect of their community. They need to do their jobs better.",1407895672

With the smaller compose window, users can view many emails while composing a single one, and the compose window stays out of the way. No back and forth to get the details you need.<p>For reading the mail as you are typing it, most humans find their eyes get tired after reading lines longer than 120 characters. A full screen compose window, could mean 200-250 characters. The current smaller popup wraps text after 72 characters, which is easier to proofread when writing (many novels wrap around 60-100 characters for this very reason).",1407895362

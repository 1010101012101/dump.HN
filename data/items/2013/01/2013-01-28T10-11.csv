I'm not sure if it's always been the way it is now, I never bothered to look at the loaded artifacts and page source for the older sites, but I get the impression that it wasn't like this before.<p>There was a big fanfare a few months back about how gov.uk was modern, useful, using industry best practices, open source tech and was just generally awesome and cool. I think what's happened is that they've either outsourced to or hired in a bunch of hip, trendy web developers s who had no real comprehension of data protection.<p>As someone with an interest in computer security, and who has in the past lived with data protection consultants, this disturbs me.<p>Anyone know which minister or ministry in the UK government is ultimately responsible for the UK government electronic data presence? Or who I might approach about these Data Protection concerns?",1359370726

If anything it will force a lot of introspection among the string pullers and any illusions people still have about privacy in the cloud (without encryption) will hopefully be shaken.

One company I worked for even required us to read a book on identifying strengths; this was not as exciting as it sounds.

And archives being locked until sometimes in the future, who knows when we will finally know about the truth.<p>For most of my life I believed Oswald wasn't the killer.  Then I found a web site that was pointing out all the problems with the Oliver Stone film and it completely convinced me that Oswald killed the president and acted completely alone (I'm not going to look for it, but this should be enough info to go on).<p>There are problems with the official story and their are things that were locked up in the archives.  But all those problems come from the <i>Kennedys</i> not anywhere else.  The reason was that the Kennedys were trying to hide JFK's numerous medical problems (e.g. his horrible case of gonorrhea that a doctor had been unsuccessfully treating for years).  Some of which he had openly lied about during his campaign and that info coming out could have wrecked Robert's political future as well.  So the family took steps to limit the effectiveness of the autopsy (it was clear how he died anyway, right?) opening the door for all the crazy conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination.<p>I saw that elsewhere you mentioned the ""back and to the left"" thing.  This is explained on the site as well.  If you watch closely you can see that his wife is holding his suit jacket and his head <i>does</i> jerk forward initially but after hitting resistance (her hand holding his suit) it goes back the other way.",1359369851

5127924,comment,5127400,5127400,13,0,AgentConundrum,,,"Cool site. I can definitely see myself browsing through it to learn some new stuff.<p>If you're interested, I made a few notes to try to help you improve the site:<p>* The point count on each Q&A section gives the points for the <i>question</i>, not the answer. The answer score doesn't seem to be given at all.<p>* Selecting a user/question which is low on the page doesn't change the scroll position. You need to manually move the browser up to the top of the content. For questions, this is easy to notice, but it's pretty jarring for users lower on the list, since there's no obvious suggestion that you're not at the top.<p>* If you select a question for which the users answer isn't the accepted one, nothing loads in the answer section, with no indication as to why.<p>* Your onclick hand;er is a bit overzealous. Ctrl+Clicking the SO link at the bottom of the answer closes the question on stack-ed. Same thing when selecting text. I'd suggest having explicit open/close buttons, or possibly just an explicit close.<p>* If you do add an explicit close, you may want to think about having the large question title at the top turn into a link to the question. I know that there's a small link at the bottom (see above), but I instinctively tried to (Ctrl+) click the larger link before I found the smaller one.<p>* You may want to consider allowing sorting by vote, in addition to your presently available view and answer count options.<p>* You may also want to consider making it a little more obvious that ""topic"" means ""tag"". The most popular tags are for languages, so its easy not to realize that it's not limited to just that.<p>* Deselecting all tags doesn't collapse the other portions of the page (top users, questions). This is a bit confusing when you're trying to select a new topic.<p>n.b. Ctrl+Click is the same as middle-click. On most laptops, there isn't a middle button under the trackpad, so we use Ctrl+Click instead. My laptop is like this, so I can't say whether a true middle click would make a difference, but I expect it wouldn't.",1359368112

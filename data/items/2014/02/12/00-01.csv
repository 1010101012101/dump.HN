I think if you spent time carefully observing people you&#x27;re around a lot with the intent of figuring out how they think you&#x27;d be able to do something very similar. It&#x27;s just that most of us (including me) don&#x27;t do that very often. Most people are reactive about such things rather than proactive.<p>As far as userids, neither you or I should be making guesses about people based on such things. :-)",1392166794

7221773,comment,7219872,7220260,4,0,urs2102,,,"Reiterating austennailred, despite being miles way from ESR or Linus, the &quot;curse of the gifted&quot; is 100% real, but I think it can actually be beneficial in the long run for a certain type of &quot;gifted&quot;.<p>There is one on hand the &quot;gifted&quot; who runs on his own fumes with no other form of external effort. Much like @austennailred notes about his efforts in high school mathematics, this type of &quot;gifted&quot; often suffers from something similar to the Dunning-Kruger effect in the long run --> in other words, a sense of superiority can potentially drive you into believing you are better than you actually are.<p>This, I believe, can happen when people attempt to pursue things which do not particularly satisfy their innate curiosity or their genuine interests. Sure you can be great at math naturally, but your view of how good you are limited by the population size of those you compare yourself against can leave you damagingly unprepared when you realize that you actually aren&#x27;t as great as you thought you were.<p>What makes the &quot;curse of the gifted&quot; the &quot;blessing of the gifted&quot; on the other hand, is when that moment where you realize your own fallibility seems to provide a moment of illumination rather than a sense of dejection.<p>For me, my first attempts at genuine college level discrete mathematics versus having used basic counting, permutations, probability, number theory principles in the past showed that computer science or at least the mathematics of computer science can be difficult. I had a similar issue in chemistry as well. The difference was even though I was always a strong math and science student, approaching college level chemistry made me just feel inferior and made me drop it. On the other hand, when faced with adversity in mathematics/CS I tended to take the difficulty as a challenge. Rather than drop it, realizing that perhaps there were others who could be better at mathematics, CS in this new environment drove me to pushing myself to a place of intense focus I had had before.<p>Now this is where I think passion crosses with the concept of the &quot;curse of the gifted&quot; to make it more of a blessing than a curse. When you love something and you know what it feels like to be best, realizing your own shortcomings can sometimes cause you to miss that feeling. Now in order to get back to a place where you &quot;feel gifted&quot; you have to be in love with the work to get there over &quot;the idea of being gifted&quot; and this I think can happen to those who are put in a position where the feeling of &quot;being gifted&quot; is compromised.<p>Anyway, just my view, first &quot;longer&quot; post I&#x27;ve written on HN but I thought austennailred had a great point and just wanted to comment.<p>Great piece by both Eric and Linus and crazy to think how 14 years later, we have Git.",1392166724

I&#x27;ve known multiple adults who skipped grades as kids, and all have said it was a good thing.<p>What <i>can</i> mess things up is throwing a kid into a group of older kids if they aren&#x27;t socially prepared for it.<p>Stupid and boring homework <i>is worthless</i>. There&#x27;s no point in defending it. Kids who have no assigned homework <i>ever</i> (in primary and secondary school [1]) can still grow up with a work ethic, a top college degree, and a great job. Heck, I know adults that were &quot;unschooled&quot; [2] as kids and who got exactly the jobs they wanted when they were ready.<p>Learning isn&#x27;t something that should be restricted to school, hard or soft skills. You can develop way more soft skills <i>interacting</i> with others than you can being forced to sit still and not talk for hours at a time. What skill does the latter teach, exactly? I don&#x27;t know why the constraints of school are <i>celebrated</i> when they should be condemned.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling</a>",1392166718

7221770,comment,7220917,7221703,1,0,sparkie,,,"Nix is indeed a replacement for package managers, but the point still stands. Package management and software builds are not completely disjoint - the latter is depends quite heavily on the former.<p>Nix itself should work on BSD (I think it&#x27;s tested on FreeBSD), but Guix is linux-only so far, as it is still in early development. I&#x27;m pretty sure Guix intends to be fully portable, even to Hurd in the long term. The ideas behind Nix is platform independent though - there shouldn&#x27;t be any reason it can&#x27;t be ported to other platforms.<p>As for building individual software on other platforms - they require different targets. (Or in fact, just an alternative configuration of the same piece of software on the same platform requires a different target). This is intentional though - targets have an identity (a SHA1 of their entire inputs), so any new platform will require a new package.<p>The package configuration format is quite useful in that regard though, as you can derive new package definitions from existing ones, so it should be possible to make partial &quot;generic&quot; configurations, then derive the platform specific targets from them. There&#x27;s quite a bit of configuration for each platform though, as the dependencies will all have different identities, all the way down to the compiler and the kernel.<p>Another potential option would be to create a template system to automatically generate the Nix configuration for multiple platforms, which would be somewhat similar to what autotools et al are doing today. The difference being, once one person has performed a build and tested it for a platform, anyone else should be able to reproduce it exactly, or to explicitly specify where he wants the target to differ.<p>In effect, Nix removes the &quot;hidden knowledge&quot; that goes into building software by requiring that you specify even the commands you used to perform the build.<p>Of course, Nix isn&#x27;t a panacea - it introduces a new set of problems, including some social ones. It might take more effort to write portable targets for each platform - but for that trade off you get reliability and simplicity for the users of the software.",1392166672

7221767,comment,7219060,7221653,1,0,dnautics,,,"> The U.S. domestic economy unlinked in 1933, permanently. Only international trade continued to use gold-backed currency, and it is that aspect which was finally eliminated in 1973.<p>If the iternational market for dollars is still linked, in spite of domestic unlinkage, there is still some level of grounding, because of the possibility of commodity arbitrage (both directly and indirectly).  Certainly there was inflation during that era, and the dollar slipped so far that it led to Nixon&#x27;s actions...  But for the most part the standard of living was able to keep up, largely thanks to technological and infrastructural improvements.  Moreover, you couldn&#x27;t soak the bankers/financial sector quite as easily because of the international connection to gold (and international currency arbitrage is more important to bankers and finance than your average domestic schmoe).<p>> Likewise you have mixed up your cause/effect for the Great Depression<p>Sorry, I should have said, I believe if we hadn&#x27;t unlinked it we would have only had a shorter, not-so-great depression (emphasis on great, not on depression).  Obviously, I&#x27;m aware that the unlinking came after the stock market crash of 29.<p>> Holding currency to a gold standard by some fixed price would be called &quot;price control&quot; in any other context, and we already know price controls to be bad policy.<p>No, price controls are setting the price relative to a standard that&#x27;s backed up by guns (guns = &quot;control&quot;, as in, if you don&#x27;t do what I say I can shoot you, or point a gun at you and take you to jail).  Dollars are already backed up by guns, so the notion of &#x27;price controlling&#x27; dollars makes no sense.  If anything, you want to back dollars by gold to keep the people with guns honest.<p>The dollar is already an &#x27;amarket&#x27; entity by virtue of its backing by the state.  A better example of &#x27;letting the market decide&#x27; in the context of &#x27;valuing currency&#x27; would be letting the interest rate float, without manipulation, which is also something we most certainly don&#x27;t do.<p>>The biggest irony for me with regard to Bitcoin is that it proves the fiat concept.<p>There are goldbugs who insist that Bitcoin is silly because it&#x27;s not tied to anything with &#x27;intrinsic value&#x27;.  That&#x27;s one interpretation of the fiat concept.  But I (and many others) interpret fiat to mean &#x27;by a higher power&#x27; (by analogy to <i>fiat lux</i>) except in the general case of state currencies, the higher power being the authority of the state.<p>Indeed a gold-backed dollar is still a fiat currency, albeit a <i>more responsible</i> one.",1392166627

For the most part those transactions would simply be reversed. Bitcoin exchanges seem a lot more exposed to computer security breaches to me.<p>> With cryptocoins, you have the advantages of keeping dollars under your mattress while still bring able to spend them anywhere that accepts them.<p>Paper currency is a bearer instrument. It can be used for offline payments. Cryptocoin can&#x27;t be. Both parties need to be connected to the rest of the coin network so the transfer can confirmed by other nodes.<p>Not to say that cryptocoins have no under-the-matress advantages.

For example, this article wants to count &quot;graphemes&quot;, and the author goes through three versions of an algorithm to account for surrogate pairs and various combining marks. All seems well in the test cases the author shows, but combining marks are only one class of codepoints that can join to form a grapheme, and the algorithm will fail for other grapheme clusters such as &#x27;நி&#x27; (Tamil letter NA + Tamil Vowel Sign I), or Hangul made of conjoining Jamo (such as &#x27;깍&#x27;: &#x27;ᄁ&#x27; + &#x27;ᅡ&#x27; + &#x27;ᆨ&#x27;), or other control characters.<p>Luckily, the Unicode Technical Committee has figured this out for you, and UAX#29 provides an algorithm for determining grapheme cluster boundaries [1].

One might have CAs vouching for one&#x27;s ownership of IP addresses.<p>All of this was simple and straightforward, with a clean model (unlike the XPKI mess which conflates identity and authorisation), so of course it failed utterly.",1392166105

If you insist on doing this then in your search for innovation you&#x27;ve drawn a box so narrow that you should not be surprised to find nothing in it. There are only so many pure text-editing actions with positive ROI and E&V mastered the bulk of them long ago. Even so, E&V haven&#x27;t been standing still. It&#x27;s true they refuse to innovate in certain directions:<p>1. Out-of-the-box integration with modern toolsets (0-configuration documentation, smart autocomplete, build, debug, jump-to-definition, etc)<p>2. Present an interface that is easily discoverable by GUI-minded folk<p>3. Take advantage of the opportunities afforded by non-textual displays<p>but each of these is done &quot;poorly&quot; in E&V for a good reason, as per your text editor / IDE distinction. They can&#x27;t change these things without stepping on the toes of their power users (i.e. all of them) and leaving behind part of what made them great, which is why this kind of innovation is happening away from E&V. Most of the apps I listed address between 1 and 3 of the above issues.

FDR temporarily unlinked in 1933 and we had the great depression [1].<p>The U.S. domestic economy unlinked in 1933, permanently. <i>Only</i> international trade continued to use gold-backed currency, and it is that aspect which was finally eliminated in 1973.<p>Likewise you have mixed up your cause/effect for the Great Depression, which started 4 years before 1933. On the contrary, the very election of FDR in 1932 was due to the economic crisis, and the unlinking of gold reserves was in response to the depression, not the cause of it.<p>One funny thing is that many people who are otherwise economically intelligent get so confused with gold. Holding currency to a gold standard by some fixed price would be called &quot;price control&quot; in any other context, and we already know price controls to be bad policy. By unlinking currency from gold we can well and truly &quot;let the market efficiently decide&quot;.<p>The biggest irony for me with regard to Bitcoin is that it <i>proves the fiat concept</i>.

I built it quickly and didn&#x27;t think much about scale.<p>Isaacs continued to improve and maintain that code. At one point he even wrote up an open standard for generic js package registries for CommonJS but they didn&#x27;t seem to care (they were too busy arguing about promises).<p>At the time I wrote the initial code I was employed at CouchOne and we had a small CouchDB hosting platform operated by Jason Smith which is where we ran the registry free of charge. Later on, after CouchOne was aquired by Membase and became Couchbase, it decided to break off the hosting company and give/sell it to Jason Smith, which became IrisCouch.<p>IrisCouch continued to run the registry for free for several years. They had no venture funding and limited resources but they provided this service for our community anyway. They announced a product for enterprise (hosted) NPM but as far as I know it wasn&#x27;t really marketed or sold. Last year IrisCouch was acquired by Nodejitsu.<p>Nodejitsu continued to host the registry for free. Some time last year the infrastructure hit a breaking point, mostly around CouchDB. Remember, I wrote this in a weekend when less than a hundred node packages existed. Many of the semantics from me and Isaacs&#x27; initial &quot;prototype&quot; persisted until just a few weeks ago. For instance, this single database held all the package binaries, for every version of a package, attached to the document for that package.<p>Once the registry started to have serious stability issues a few things happened. Isaacs started to work on ways to improve the reliability by changing how the registry worked and Nodejitsu sought community support for keeping the current registry up. At some point Isaacs also decided it would be best if he worked on NPM full time and built NPM Inc.<p>In the early days we weren&#x27;t thinking about 58K modules, that was just crazy, we were just figuring out the simplest way to store a couple packages the node community was writing. Since founding this company Isaacs has already managed to re-write the way the registry works to fit the kind of load we have now.<p>Nodejitsu is now free of the financial burden that was dragging them down as well and Isaacs&#x27; new infrastructure can keep the registry up more cheaply than the previous system and more reliably.",1392164770

7221602,comment,7218651,7219813,2,0,ArbitraryLimits,,,"> As long as the costs of fraud are borne by the individual merchants I doubt it will be fixed. Fundamentally flawed system design / perverse incentives.<p>Sure, but be sure to empower consumers against the banks if you make the banks liable instead.<p>I&#x27;ve always found this case study from the classic &quot;Why Cryptosystems Fail&quot; fascinating:<p>In some countries (including the USA), the banks have to carry the risks associated with new technology. Following a legal precedent, in which a bank customer&#x27;s word that she had not made a withdrawal was found to outweigh the banks&#x27; experts&#x27; word that she must have done [JC], the US Federal Reserve passed regulations which require banks to refund all disputed transactions unless they can prove fraud by the customer [E]. This has led to some minor abuse - misrepresentations by customers are estimated to cost the average US bank about $15,000 a year [W2] - but it has helped promote the development of security technologies such as cryptology and video.<p>In Britain, the regulators and courts have not yet been so demanding, and despite a parliamentary commission of enquiry which found that the PIN system was insecure [J1], bankers simply deny that their systems are ever at fault. Customers who complain about debits on their accounts for which they were not responsible - so-called `phantom withdrawals&#x27; - are told that they are lying, or mistaken, or that they must have been defrauded by their friends or relatives.<p>The most visible result in the UK has been a string of court cases, both civil and criminal. The pattern which emerges leads us to suspect that there may have been a number of miscarriages of justice over the years.<p>* A teenage girl in Ashton under Lyme was convicted in 1985 of stealing £40 from her father. She pleaded guilty on the advice of her lawyers that she had no defence, and then disappeared; it later turned out that there had been never been a theft, but merely a clerical error by the bank [MBW]<p>* A Sheffield police sergeant was charged with theft in November 1988 and suspended for almost a year after a phantom withdrawal took place on a card he had confiscated from a suspect. He was lucky in that his colleagues tracked down the lady who had made the transaction after the disputed one; her eyewitness testimony cleared him<p>* Charges of theft against an elderly lady in Plymouth were dropped after our enquiries showed that the bank&#x27;s computer security systems were a shambles<p>* In East Anglia alone, we are currently advising lawyers in two cases where people are awaiting trial for alleged thefts, and where the circumstances give reason to believe that `phantom withdrawals&#x27; were actually to blame.<p>Finally, in 1992, a large class action got underway in the High Court in London [MB], in which hundreds of plaintiffs seek to recover damages from various banks and building societies. We were retained by the plaintiffs to provide expert advice, and accordingly conducted some research during 1992 into the actual and possible failure modes of automatic teller machine systems. This involved interviewing former bank employees and criminals, analysing statements from plaintiffs and other victims of ATM fraud, and searching the literature. We were also able to draw on experience gained during the mid-80&#x27;s on designing cryptographic equipment for the financial sector, and advising clients overseas on its use.",1392164134

I consistently failed in high school despite being pretty promising in primary school ... but that&#x27;s just &#x27;cause I &quot;wasn&#x27;t trying&quot;, right?<p>Well, maybe so, but maths is a skill. You can&#x27;t ignore it for 4 years and then pick it up in the same way you can with English or Japanese or Sociology.<p>So when it came to year 11 and 12, when I actually wanted to do well at maths, I couldn&#x27;t, so I <i>borderline</i> failed high school maths.<p>A foible of the (Australian) state in which I went to year 11/12 meant that, despite not using maths towards my university entrance score, I was still allowed to use it as a pre-requisite to get into a university course.<p>I didn&#x27;t go to uni straight away because I didn&#x27;t really know what I wanted to do. At age 21 and on a whim, on the last day that you could mail your applications in, I picked Mechatronic Engineering from the handbook and sent in my application. Why? Because I thought it sounded cool (I used to love Robotech :) but I had no idea that Engineering was so maths heavy (that&#x27;s how ignorant I was of the field).<p>First year I failed everything. The only thing I did well in was programming, so I took 2 years off and got a job as a programmer. In the last 6 months before I started uni again, I went through my Calculus text book from the beginning, going over my first year uni notes and assignments at the same time. Answering all the problems in the book, etc.<p>As it turns out, the things that were most nobbling my ability to do calculus was lack of understanding of algebra, trigonometry, geometry ... things like logs and graphs and functions, factorisation, all that stuff. Once I&#x27;d learned that, I discovered the rest wasn&#x27;t so bad.<p>I re-did my first year subjects in summer school that year and passed (even got some Credits which is 65+!) and then managed to get a low distinction in one of my second year courses.<p>You never saw a guy so happy with his 75 in Vector Calculus :) all the engineering geeks were crying in their pillows because they got a 98 instead of a 100 but I was punching some serious air.<p>Getting past this personal myth that I was &quot;just bad at maths&quot; is one of the most important things I&#x27;ve ever done. It really taught me that, with persistent execution and incremental improvement, you can learn and do anything (within reason: ie. I probably can&#x27;t learn to levitate although I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong :)",1392164037

Likewise I don&#x27;t think people look on Wikipedia to check if they might be feminists.<p>My point is that many who say they are feminists because they want equal rights have actually joined forces with something much more negative instead.<p>&quot;In either case, economic realities dictate who stays home and how long -- and that is an impediment to equal (parenting) rights.&quot;<p>But what if women choose jobs with lower pay but higher flexibility, so that they can stay at home with kids? Isn&#x27;t that a sensible and reasonable choice? Which, btw., nobody is forced to make. There are plenty of women who earn a lot of money.<p>You will argue that society expects women to stay at home, but ultimately, people in the Western world are free to choose their own mates. I think a lot of men wouldn&#x27;t mind staying at home and marrying well earning women.<p>As I said in other comments, I think it is actually a female privilege to be allowed to stay home, and also to choose jobs with lower wages. That&#x27;s where I think feminists have it completely backwards.<p>If you think about it, why would a woman support a man staying at home? Why not pay a nurse instead, might be cheaper than paying half of your income. The other way round it doesn&#x27;t work because women give childbirth.<p>Of course all the articles about relationships breaking when the woman earns more than the man make the cause out to be male desire for dominance and vanity. What if instead it is the women who can&#x27;t cope with it - because they don&#x27;t have to?<p>You look at the numbers and decide women must get a bad rap - you claim all you want is free choice for everyone. But the possibility that women chose their path deliberately doesn&#x27;t enter your mind. That&#x27;s the feminist bias at work. Which, btw., seems to assume women are stupid. Feminism is a weird beast indeed.<p>Another indicator that women&#x27;s choices might not be so stupid at all is their significantly longer life expectancy over men&#x27;s. Personally I&#x27;d happily trade a chunk of my pay check for a 10 years longer life.",1392163361

In a debate I&#x27;m usually able to rationally disassemble another person&#x27;s arguments and &quot;win&quot;...and I remember the moment that she presented her argument and it was different than mine and I realized she was absolutely correct and I had built a sloppy argument in my mind.<p>I told myself, &quot;I can&#x27;t let her do that to me again&quot;, because it didn&#x27;t feel good to actually really lose an argument because the other person was authentically correct and I was wrong.<p>And then it happened again and again.<p>I had never met another human being where that happened, ever.<p>If I feel this confident about my argument, it means I usually know it well enough that I can out argue anybody, it got me out of lots of fist fights in school, but also into lots of trouble with my teachers as I disassembled their lessons -- literary symbolism was a bad class for me for example as I challenged many of the asserted symbols and interpretations.<p>If I don&#x27;t know it well enough I usually just keep quiet about it or don&#x27;t get involved in a debate in the first place, and instead sit back and quietly learn.<p>But with her, she was able to, with less information, completely out-think me. To this day she still does it with alarming regularity.<p>She&#x27;s been amazing, she helps me clarify my thinking and keep focused and not get caught up in negative thinking and actions too much. She comes up with and gives me constant challenges that take years to complete and keep me engaged in constructive positive thinking rather than destructive/deconstructive thinking. She&#x27;s helped me get past decades of hurt and social isolation from my childhood and has literally polished me into a productive member of society.",1392163321

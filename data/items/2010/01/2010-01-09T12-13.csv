[1] Ask my clients.<p>Websites can be very <i>cheap</i>, provided your entire vision of web publishing is stuck in 1995: a bunch of $5/month web hosts full of cookie-cutter blogs that will fall over every time they get linked by anyone. But good web hosting costs money. Good web software with any custom feature whatsoever costs much, much more money. Designers cost money, and cost the time required to find them.<p>Google are masters of the art of making ad-supported websites <i>feel</i> ""free"", but Google operates at massive scale, milking a giant cash cow whenever they need to support a loss leader for a while. Most other free sites come with very strict limitations: If their traffic drops below a certain point, they cease to be financially viable, whereupon they only last as long as a publisher is willing to pour time and money into them with no hope of return. That leads to phenomena like SEO-oriented blogs whose authors write with one eye firmly fixed on their ad traffic. Those are fine, in their role, but there are times when one wants something different.<p>--<p>[1] That's ""free as in beer"". There are many websites built entirely on free software, of course, but those fail your first criterion.",1263041734

1041415,comment,1041071,1041402,0,0,olavk,,,"In my experience it is easier to change a normalized scheme then a non-normalized. The redundancy and integrity issues of non-normalized schemas are really difficult to deal with when the schema has to evolve due to changing business needs. I have certainly never observed that un-normalized data should make it <i>easier</i> to evolve a schema - can you provide an example of when this would be the case?<p>Regarding performance optimization, I think it is valuable to distinguish between the logical model and the physical model. Any kind of caching is a kind of redundancy, but that is not a problem if the database engine guarantees the integrity of the logical model. Relational database engines provides ways to optimize the physical storage and querying of data without compromising the logical model. For example materialized views can provide the same kind of optimization as a denormalized table in the 5-way join case - but without the integrity issues.",1263041024

That’s called “stretching”.<p>My understanding is that unless you add a nonce at each iteration, this wouldn't help at all, and probably would just increase the number of collisions. Is that correct?<p>I recently had to look at the phpBB password hashing scheme. As I recall, they iterate MD5 a small-ish number of times without adding a new nonce. There's a comment which says their scheme would be improved if they did something - but then it would be slower, which means they'd use fewer iterations, which would make it less secure.",1263039265

1041380,comment,1039896,1041007,0,0,lispm,,,"the price of FEXPRs is not 'dynamic scope', the price is that compilation gets hopeless. No matter how fast your interpreter is, for most practical purposes a native code compiler will a) do some checks at compile time and b) the compiled code runs orders of magnitude faster.<p>Dynamic scope is not about 'power', initially it was an implementation error. Then it stayed in Lisp for a while. Unfortunately most Lisp compilers implemented lexical scope (also because it runs faster), while interpreters stayed with dynamic scope. With Scheme the whole thing got cleared up and interpreters and compilers of the same language now were using lexical scope. Dynamic scope was now an extension (so-called 'fluid lets'). The developers of Common Lisp accepted that this was the right thing (like anyone else in Functional Programming and most Lisps like ISLisp, EuLisp, Dylan, ...) and adopted lexical binding, also requiring that the compiler and interpreter behave the same. Common Lisp additionally allowed to use dynamic binding when declared, because in many places it is a useful feature - just not be default.<p>The so-called 'Newlisp', from 1991, invented some of their own ideas, went back to old ideas and reused names (like 'macro' for 'fexpr') in confusing ways. The thing where it gets stupid is where people believe that it is 'better designed' (it is as ugly as most Lisps) or that it is 'faster' (for constructed benchmarks).<p>The problem with dynamic scope is not name clashes. The problem is that I don't know what bindings MY code will use, because somebody else might have rebound variables or functions in his code. That's the purpose of dynamic binding: injecting new bindings into old code. Additionally it is bad for compiled code, etc.<p>Newlisp is full of potentially scope problems and writing anything larger than a small script with FEXPRs is a maintenance nightmare. There has been lots of code being written with FEXPRs in the past, but today it is gone. Much of the dynamism that it provides is just not needed and simply gets in the way. One can generate artificial requirements where FEXPRs would be useful, in practice they are a relict of the past. Scheme and Common Lisp and all the other lexical scoped dialects are plenty expressive.",1263038416

It was based on anonymized tracking of cars with cell phone GPS signals to better understand the whole traffic network of the Bay Area. Identifying choke points for traffic led to a policy proposal.<p>""John Goodwin, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the region's transportation planning agency, says the best way to spread out traffic coming from these neighborhoods is to install metering lights at their freeway onramps, which spaces out the traffic to help both those drivers and everyone else get to their destinations quicker. Though many important Bay Area freeways already have metering lights, such as Interstate 280 in the South Bay and Interstate 680 in the East Bay, others don't.""<p>The Twin Cities metropolitan area, where I live, was the first place in the United States to gain special federal permission to put on-ramp metered signal lights on federal Interstate Highways used heavily by commuters. They empirically help a lot in smoothing traffic. One reason we know that is that for a while a doofus state legislator shut down the freeway metered ramp program, until traffic here became so unbearable that the meters were put back in use. I have heard from friends who travel here from other parts of the country that the ramp meters (implemented as red-yellow-green traffic signals just before a car gets onto the freeway) are confusing to people who usually drive where on-ramps are just unimpeded paths onto the freeway. But they definitely speed up traffic.<p>The Twin Cities has one federal highway, Interstate 394, with a pair of reversible lanes, usually eastbound (into Minneapolis from the suburbs where I live) in the morning, and westbound (out of the city into the suburbs) in the evenings. That helps with rush hour commuter traffic, except that a lot of cars are eastbound for evening appointments even as commuters are leaving the city, so the reversal of lanes still leaves the regular, nonreversible lanes badly congested each evening. I wonder if a traffic study like the one reported in the interesting article submitted here could identify how to smooth out the traffic problems we still have here.",1357677728

5028340,comment,5027480,5027795,2,0,betterunix,,,"""if there are any photos on the internet that will go away it's these, if for no other reason, because they're illegal.""<p>I doubt it; the existence of an FBI database of known child abuse photos suggests that long after these images are identified, they continue to be shared online.  Given how many amateur porn websites there are, and how older teenagers can easily pass for adults (thus reducing the likelihood that whatever moderators such websites have will reject the photos), it is almost certain that such photos will continue to be available online long after the girls/boys are adults and have forgotten the whole episode.<p>I think this argument is a red herring, though.  The problem as I see it is not what happens when the photos are out there, the problem is that our notion of sex ed still comes out of the 1950s.  We teach children about sex when they are old enough that there is a non-trivial probability they already started having sex.  We limit sex ed to information about STIs and a reminder to use a condom (but in New York City, we were not actually shown how to apply one).<p>We need to update our approach to sex ed to reflect the realities of this century.  First of all, children should start receiving some amount of sex ed long before they start having sex; clearly it will need to be explained in a way that is age-appropriate, but we cannot continue to put it off.  Second, we must include a discussion about modern technology as it relates to sex -- that includes cameras, computers, and the Internet; if we know that teenagers are doing this, we need to explain to them how to be responsible (in the same way that we say, ""use a condom because some STIs last forever,"" we should be saying, ""don't let photos or videos be taken, because they last on the Internet forever"").  We need to be frank with kids about these issues, or else they are just going to run wild and ""learn"" from their friends (who will almost always give them bad advice, betray them, or otherwise ""do it wrong"").<p>Yes, technology changes things.  That is not a surprise.  That is not shocking.  If we fail to adapt to those changes, we'll just wind up in the same position as the RIAA and MPAA:  crying, whining, and pushing for destructive laws.",1357677361

Issues about consent, how you treat current and former partners, slut shaming, perceptions and stereotypes about gender with regards to sexuality, and about sexual agency are all a part of bullying via spreading of explicit pictures/video. These issues are tremendously important because many people do not have any basic information about any of these subjects and these issues shape the way they experience the world. The popularity of sites like Scarleteen show that there is a very real demand for this kind of information and sex education should include this information at a minimum.<p>I agree that what I mentioned isn't enough and that the situation is more complicated.

Think of how the app works: You take a picture, add a caption, and draw on the picture if you please. Then you select friends to send it to and you're done. That can be accomplished in < 30 seconds. Viewing snaps sent from friends is at MAX 10 seconds per snap.

But on the flip side - having some single pool of up-to-date knowledge is different than a circlejerk, and the ""our way or the highway"" attitude is very prevalent in some programming communities. Besides being incredibly alienating to newbies, it actively holds back development of new features and discussion of new ideas because these community managers are not trying to solve the same set of problems as the developers using the language/framework.<p>Yes, it's a damn shame that plenty of PHP example code is from 2006 and still sitting at the top of Google - but by and large, it still works just fine and has accurate information. It may be doing messy stuff like mysql_real_escape_string instead of prepared statements, but the end result is the same.<p>All of the community and documentation in the world won't stop people from using the tools wrong, and if you take away all the potentially-dangerous tools, you're left with very few things that are actually useful.  I'll reiterate my previous point here: something with a low barrier to entry will tend to attract novices, and novices tend to make a lot more mess than seasoned practitioners. If PHP didn't exist and Python or Ruby took its place as the easiest thing to get up and running with, most (no, not all - I've worked with PHP long enough to know which ones are genuinely PHP-specific, and it's not many) of these PHP-hate comments could be run through s/PHP/NEWLANG/g and be completely accurate.

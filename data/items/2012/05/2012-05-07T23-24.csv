3941513,comment,3940180,3940180,6,0,SeoxyS,,,"I think Chat is one of those core services, like Email that has standardized around one common standard. People use a wide variety of clients, and very different uses from basic to power user needs. The reason most chat services fail is that even if they have fantastic mobile and web clients, they cannot provide the sheer range of clients needed for the entire range of use cases.<p>At Chartboost, we've tried pretty much every protocol there is, but we still stick to IRC. It's the only protocol that has clients that suit all of us, from hardcore `irssi` to newbie Adium integration. There's also bouncers and solid local histories and it's easy to hop onto tech channels for some help and it's widely supported with chatbots and libraries for building your own chatbot. (eg. Ruby-IRC)",1336435194

It's not hard at all to participate in the ES-Discuss mailing list. You just have to treat it with at least the same degree of respect you'd treat any other forum full of people smarter than you.<p>Now when I say that, I don't mean that just because they are smarter you have nothing to contribute, but you have to pick up your game a little bit and try not to be completely ignorant when you make a suggestion- since all that does is increase the noise level.

I'm inclined to agree with you there, especially when the target sortfolio customers are businesses, $99/m is easy to forget about until you're asked to renew your details. I wonder if 37 Signals will publish information on how many of their $99/m paying customers (although at $99/m that's only about 200?) actually login and use the site every month, although maybe they'll disclose that to interested parties.",1336434985

3941492,comment,3937871,3937871,1,0,cbsmith,,,"I think the amazing thing about this post is it suggests an incredibly myopic view of the world. Even if you look at the most basic function of what a web site is and compare it with the non-web version, you see complexity. Billboards, magazines, newspapers, books, etc., all have incredibly complex and intricate development processes, much of which is done by hand. The tools are somewhat more standardized, but that is mostly because the technology is much, much older. You try going back to the first 50 years of those technologies and you'll find it is pretty messy.<p>The reality is that these things get complex and intricate because that is what the system demands. I can make a website in <1 minute. It's not hard. However, it won't stand out amongst the sea of sites out there, which kind of defeats the purpose. This is why tools that facilitate the process, while improving the quality of the final product, don't actually reduce the time it takes to build a site, because improving efficiency just raises the bar higher about what a quality site needs to be.",1336434768

Otherwise any patching would not produce a leak free roof that would last for 20+ years like it should. I've worked on software projects where we went back in and completely re-worked the UI or re-wrote some data access layer stuff without a full rewrite.

In the public markets for active fund managers, there is almost no correlation. For vc funds, there is a decent correlation. My hypothesis is that the reason for the difference is information inefficiency. In the public markets, everyone is oerating with the same information, so it's hard to create a sustained advantage. In the private markets, one fund may have access to information (seeing companies no one else sees, knowing customer or acquirers, etc).

3941374,comment,3939779,3941327,4,0,hej,,,"Not so much evidence (from trials, say), rather plausibility. We do not understand how Homeopathy works, but it goes even a level deeper: There is a certain and very specific process for creating those homeopathic remedies and from what we currently know about, say, physics, that process cannot leave you with some sort of active ingredient. If homeopathy were to work, our understanding of physics (which we have lots of evidence for) would most certainly be wrong in some ways.<p>That doesnt mean that homeopathy is definitely wrong, but it does mean that the signal should be very strong for us to even be considering it to be not wrong. There are also levels to this: Im pretty sure there are remedies about which we dont know how they work, but them working would at least not require us to overhaul the laws of physics. Thats still worse than remedies for which we already have a model of how they work in mind, but at least its something.<p>Although you cant really quantify that, I think such plausibility arguments are vitally important for any research. In fact, since time and money is limited, all researchers (in any field) will always try to limit themselves to what is plausible. Explaining why your model and your hypotheses are plausible is a big part of any scientific work. Plausibility is already a big part of science.",1336432332

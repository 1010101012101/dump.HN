UTF-32 captures all of them but wastes at least 11 bit per code point, more right now because most of the code points are unassigned.

But then if you continue to think about it, the reason wordpress is so successful is not just because of the ease of installation etc, it is because of the eco-system it has created. I have looked at a few closed source CMS&#x27;s and in fact been thinking of building my own from scratch, but I keep going back to WP for CMS. It just works and so many clients are already using it or at least &quot;heard&quot; of it.<p>You can literally setup a decent working website in a day with WP. Want to create pages in WYSIWYG ? Done. Want to manage users ? Done. Wnat to add your social icons ? Oh, there is a plugin for that which is rated by 1000s of other clients. Want to sell stuff ? Np.

9573075,comment,9571870,9572579,0,0,geebee,,,"&quot;Normally, when I heard this whole &quot;I don&#x27;t do coding tests&quot; attitude, it comes from a candidate who thinks that he/she is so amazing that the rules don&#x27;t apply.&quot;<p>You know, I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s it for a lot of people who don&#x27;t like technical &quot;interviews&quot;.  You&#x27;re seeing this as an ego issue, when there really are problems with the technical exam/interview, especially when it is abused.<p>Personally, I think the problems start with the fact that we&#x27;re calling what is actually an exam an &quot;interview&quot;, and it&#x27;s an exam taken under very stressful circumstances.  Think of it this way - I read a blog post about someone who studied for the california bar for 100 hours and passed.  The exam itself was 3 days long.  Now, 100 hours is notably low, and part of the point of the post was to suggest that you don&#x27;t actually need to study as long as people often do.<p>But think about this think about what it takes to prepare for a technical interview.  Have you read &quot;cracking the coding interview&quot;?  Those are difficult problems, and you need to be able to solve them at a white board within 45 minutes (or at least get close enough that you can do it with some, but not too much, coaching).  It&#x27;s not at all over the top that a rusty person would need to spend 50+ hours to get fluid with this.  If your data structures, bit manipulation, tree traversal, dynamic programming, threading, or other topics are very rusty, you will need to study before beginning your study.  It&#x27;s not at all uncommon to spend an amount of time that starts to approach bar exam preparation levels.  One interview typically lasts all day.  So preparing for and completing three interviews is actually roughly on a par with taking the bar exam.<p>Unfortunately, you rarely get feedback on your performance (for legal reasons, I understand).  You have no idea if your exam was graded fairly or consistently, and you have no idea if your examiners have the credentials and expertise to actually understand a novel solution.  Sometimes you get advance warning about what might be tested but other times you are completely blindsided by the questions.  Once you pass the bar, you&#x27;ve passed.  Software interviews, on the other hand, you have to do over and over.  And even worse, we often present these tests as sniffing out frauds rather than looking for exceptional talent (ie., an exceptional performance on these exams rarely get you much above the job offered, so it&#x27;s more about not losing than winning).<p>Really, there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to object to here.  You don&#x27;t have to think you&#x27;re amazing or above it all to start thinking this is a serious problem that may be driving talented people away from our industry.  I&#x27;ve read various blog posts about potentially promising candidates who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> interviewing anymore simply because they&#x27;re too intimidated, or because they just can&#x27;t afford to put 50+ hours of study into something that may be completely capricious and depend purely on what some overworked programmer thinks is important that day.  I can&#x27;t imagine my graduate program&#x27;s MS exit exam, or the bar, or the state nursing license board, or any respectable exam committee getting away with being so capricious and opaque.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve hired before, and I&#x27;d be afraid to hire without a technical exam.  So I hear you, I really do.  And I&#x27;ve been on technical interviews, even tough ones, that I actually kind of enjoyed (I so rarely do real dynamic programming or tree traversal, and it is actually kind of fun, under the right circumstances).<p>But we spend so much time talking about a desperate shortage of software engineers, and so little time actually recognizing some of the things that make our industry really exceptionally unpleasant.  I think we should recognize that tech exam/interviews, while perhaps necessary, are also a potential problem, enough of a problem that some people are starting to boycott them altogether (I will do them, though I won&#x27;t do an unpaid take-home ever again).<p>It may in fact be an ego problem some of the time, but since there&#x27;s clearly a more legitimate reason to object to this practice, let&#x27;s start there, rather than dismissing this as an ego problem.",1432068981

9573072,comment,9571322,9571322,0,0,mc32,,,"Public radio is a mixed bag.  It&#x27;s better than most but I dislike the pretense of being better, because in my view they are only marginally better when presenting news.<p>One of the things I&#x27;m most disenchanted with is how on uncontroversial things they&#x27;ll offer an opinion.  &quot;lack of oversight is bad&quot;.  But on controversial issues they tend to appear neutral (offering no opinion) while at the same time couching the questions and loading their questions.  So when it comes to controversial subjects they take a position, but they try to hide it, which, to me, is more perverse than the blatant left and blatant right, who at least aren&#x27;t pretending to be objective.  That&#x27;s to say nor, while marginally better, comparatively, isn&#x27;t all that good and show bias in their reporting and choice of news.<p>For example, the strife in some inner cities was cast as police vs population when in reality government is at greatest fault.  They put the police there to mop up after their failed or non existent policies to better peoples desperate lives.  So the police are their last desperate attempt at controlling a situation for which they fell asleep at the wheel then blast police for the situation.",1432068949

9573060,comment,9572288,9572878,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"I think a deeper discussion of what it means to be a technology company and the focus of bay area companies would be a hijack here.  But, very briefly, if you view Google and Facebook as &quot;technology companies&quot;, we disagree.  The closest analogue to Google in terms of business model is a company now called Dex but for decades known as R. H. Donnelley and Sons, which published telephone books and sold advertising in them in the form of the Yellow Pages.  Facebook&#x27;s best analogue is probably a reality television show production company.  These companies and many of their brethren are not in the business of developing and marketing new technology.  They are in the media business and any technology they happen to develop is a sideshow.  It may be used internally and never shared or it may be made open source for any of a number of (usually sound) business reasons, but the development and marketing of that technology is neither the company&#x27;s primary business nor a significant source of its revenue.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, read the 10-Ks.  You are what your revenue says you are.<p>There are many, many other examples.  If you look at a random sampling of promotional posts to HN, you will see a cross-section of the entire global economy: retailers (lots of &#x27;em), restaurants, media, manufacturing, and yes, technology.  It&#x27;s fair to say that a lot of people in the bay area are interested in technology, but most of their employers are properly placed in other sectors based on their business models, revenue sources, and other objective metrics.  The development of new technology for sale as a business model has been in decline for a long time and is far from dominant in the bay area today.<p>Note that this is not necessarily good or bad.  It just is, and reflects a transition among a group of people from developing new technologies to exploiting that technology in more traditional business models.",1432068808

You have views, CCK and a lot of handy stuff.<p>On the other hand, one cannot customize Wordpress without writing more than a few php tags or downloading a plugin that will mess up with the original db schema.

Civil disobedience (openly democratic) is about kickstarting the political process, swaying society in the hopes of swaying their representatives. But civil noncompliance (covertly democratic) is about bypassing politics entirely, forcing authorities to either punish the community at large or acknowledge the impotence of the law in question.<p>This is all very stream-of-consciousness on my end, hopefully it&#x27;s coming across with some clarity.",1432068108

9572984,comment,9569718,9569718,0,0,Gnarl,,,"The condition of electro-hypersensitivity mentioned in the article is real and research results into objective physiological markers were presented at a recent scientific conference in Belgium by Prof. Dominique Belpomme of the ARTAC institute. I expect this to be published soon but for now I copy here the abstract from Belpomme&#x27;s presentation:<p>-----------\n&quot;Since 2009, we prospectively investigated clinically and biologically 1200 consecutive EHS (Electro-HyperSensitivity) and/or MCS (Multiple Chemical-Sensitivity) self reported cases, in an attempt to establish objective diagnosis criteria and to elucidate the pathophysiological aspects of these two disorders. Inclusion criteria were: absence of diagnosed pathology; reproduced symptoms under the influence of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and/or chemicals, whatever their incriminated source; and regression or disappearance of symptoms in the case of EMF and/or chemical avoidance. We report here our preliminary results, based on the analysis of 839 originally enrolled cases of which 810 met the inclusion criteria and 727 were evaluable. 521 were diagnosed with EHS, 52 with MCS and 154 with both EHS and MCS. Sex ratio (F/M) was 495/232, meaning that 2 out of 3 patients with EHS and/or MCS were female; mean age (years) was 47.9 ± 12.4 and median age was 47 (range 16-83), with no significant difference between the 3 groups in those characteristics. Concomitant multiple food intolerance was found in 28.5%, 41.9% and 70.4% of the cases in the 3 groups respectively. Since inflammation appears to be a key process resulting from the EMF and/or chemical effects on tissues, and histamine release is potentially a major trait of inflammation, we systematically measured histamine in the blood of patients. Importantly, 37%, 36.7% and 41.5% of the patients respectively in the 3 above individualized groups showed a significant increase in histaminemia (>10 nmol/l), meaning that a chronic inflammatory response can be detected in these patients. As the release of oxidants is part of the basic process of inflammation and they are a key contributor to damage and response, we also measured nitrotyrosin (NTT), a marker of both peroxynitrite (ONOO .- ) production and opening of the blood brain barrier (BBB). NTT was increased in the blood (>0.90 μg/ml) in 29.7%, 26% and 28% of the cases in our 3 groups, respectively. Likewise protein S100B, another marker of BBB opening was found to be increased in the blood (>0.105 μg/L) in 14.7%, 19.7% and 10.7% of our cases, respectively. Circulating antibodies against O-myelin, Hsp 27 and/or Hsp 70 protein were also found to be increased in 43.1%, 25% and 52% of our cases respectively, indicating that the EHS and MCS disorders are associated with some autoimmune response. Since most patients reported chronic insomnia and fatigue, we also determined the 24h urine melatonin/creatinin ratio and found it was decreased (<0.8) in all investigated cases.<p>Finally, in order to gain further information about the underlying mechanisms of EHS and MCS, we serially measured the brain blood flow in the temporal lobes of each patient by using pulsed brain echodoppler. We found that both disorders were associated with an hypo-perfusion in the capsulothalamic area, suggesting that the inflammatory process may in fact involve the limbic system and the thalamus.<p>This ongoing study already strongly suggests that EHS and MCS can be objectively characterized and diagnosed with very simple tests. Both disorders appear to paint a common picture of inflammation-related hyper-histaminemia, oxidative stress, autoimmune response and BBB opening, and a deficit in melatonin excretion. EHS and MCS probably share a common pathological mechanism mainly involving the nervous central system.&quot;\n-----------<p>My note: The take home message here is that chronic, low-level, microwave exposure (like from cellphone & wi-fi) causes immune-system activation and inflammation, possibly leading to immune-system burnout if not controlled. Based on the results it is advised to reduce exposure now.",1432067940

High-end graphics chips have, in the past, pushed the boundaries of possible chip sizes right up to the edges of the reticle used in photolithography. Since HBM requires an interposer chip that&#x27;s larger than the GPU alone, it could impose a size limitation on graphics processors. When asked about this issue, Macri noted that the fabrication of larger-than-reticle interposers might be possible using multiple exposures, but he acknowledged that doing so could become cost-prohibitive.<p>Fiji will more than likely sit on a single-exposure-sized interposer, and it will probably pack a rich complement of GPU logic given the die size savings HBM offers.

On one hand you&#x27;re now forced to more completely define the semantics/syntax from scratch (you can&#x27;t bootstrap, though I think to some degree that &#x27;definition by implementation&#x27; here is a big fallacy) but then on the other you&#x27;re also facing a much greater task if your primary end goal is to just better focus on the domain.<p>In my opinion, DSLs are just languages with an intent to hit a target domain. External DSLs, as I call what you call DSLs at large, are one mechanism for doing that. Internal DSLs, which are not really distinct from APIs + their conventions, have the interesting property, however, of arising in layers. This aids composition and speed to develop.<p>But they absolutely suffer from being compromised on semantics and syntax due to their embedding. And before a Lisper comes by and talks about macros, I think the tradeoff is fundamental.

Stem cell treatments are clearly beneficial, but will most likely give way to other methods of directly altering the behavior of native cells. Delivering signal molecules into the environment, or small molecules capable of otherwise adjusting cell epigenetic state.<p>In the final analysis if you can repair other forms of damage, many of the issues with regeneration should go away, as lost healing capacity is a result of age-related stem cell decline that it is in turn largely a reaction to a damaged environment. This of course needs to be proved. The best way to prove it is to implement the damage repair biotechnologies, see what happens.<p>Currently the major research focus in the mainstream is not to repair damage at all. It is rather to identify changes in signals and reverse them, and thus wake up stem cells and put them back to work on tissue maintenance, even damaged as they are and damaged as the tissue environment is. This is actually producing far better results with far less cancer as a result than you might think it would, which is always a bonus, but it isn&#x27;t what I would consider the best path ahead.<p>Replacement of stem cell populations in the old are probably a necessary treatment. Clear out all damaged cells and generate a set of replacement cells from the patient&#x27;s own tissues. Do that and then the organs should sort themselves out, except for gross damage that might need more treatment to rescue, such as deformation of the cardiovascular system as a result of hypertension that probably won&#x27;t reverse itself.",1432067262

As I read the story about Mr. Wilsey, the father and husband, I was <i>constantly</i> reminded of my grandfather, directly but more indirectly.<p>He was 51 years old when I was born, and I spent most of my first six years with him and my grandmother.  At that time, my parents divorced and assigned full legal custody of me to my grandparents.  I grew up there, leaving when I was 18, and my grandfather was 69, my grandmother 67.<p>My grandparents were kind to me, but my grandfather was distant.  He was distant with everyone.  He had only a single close friend, who died of cancer in the late 70s.  He almost never spoke of what he went through in the war.  He rarely spoke at all.  He had a quick wit, and rarely, he would inject acerbic barbs into conversations.<p>He took me to some Veterans of Foreign Wars meetings in the early 80s, where I met and spoke to two other old men, whose names I can not recall.  They served with him in Burma.<p>Several times, they took me aside and told me things about my grandfather.  Things he would never speak of.  How he could fire a clip from his BAR on full automatic and lethally aim individual clusters of bullets, singly stopping a Japanese assault.<p>They told me that he lost, killed, six different ammunition carriers.  How a slug lodged in his femur and extensive fragmentation wounds had no impact on his ability to slaughter the enemy, day after day, night after night, week after week, month after month.<p>I learned how he had received the pile of ribbons and medals that I had caught a fleeting glimpse of in the attic.<p>The daily horror, fear and relative certainty of death.  Of the horrors they inflicted, all too often needlessly.<p>The man who raised me also raised my father.  But those 25 years made a big difference.  I&#x27;m sure that all of the critical words and quick anger were still inside him in the 70s and 80s, but inside they stayed.<p>Though I never heard the word &#x27;love&#x27; come from his mouth, I had no doubt that my grandfather would do anything for me.  And he did.<p>Though notoriously cheap (for instance, we &#x27;harvested&#x27; ketchup and mustard packets from Jack in the Box to refill our supply), my grandfather spent many hundreds and thousands of dollars to buy me a Color Computer and a TRS-80 Model 100 laptop in the early 80s.  Though he had only a 6th grade education, he knew, in broad strokes, what the future would look like, and the things his grandson would need to learn.<p>I speak little of my grandmother here.  She was a far more open and loving person, but she took heavy doses of Valium and related drugs the whole time I was with them, and after.  She and her husband had slept in separate beds since before I was born.  They had no love for each other.  They were house-mates, generally tolerating each others presence, and helping each other as needed.<p>In many ways, my grandparents were progressive, open-minded people.  But they did not support of &quot;mixed marriage.&quot;  Though it didn&#x27;t drive them crazy either.  &quot;Live and let live&quot; was their credo.  Yet they were raised in casual, abstract and always present racism.  I heard a lot about how the &quot;Mexicans are taking all of our jobs&quot;, growing up in Southern California.<p>This isn&#x27;t all that pleasant, but it is Real Life.  Real Life is muddy and complex and conflicted.  And people in the past carried different cultural burdens than we do today.<p>After their deaths, I, like so many others, venerated the Greatest Generation.  During their lives, I took my grandparents for granted.  But they were patient with me.  They were pretty sure I would grow out of my selfishness and arrogance, even though they would not live to see it.  And they were ok with that.  Their love and support were iron-clad and steadfast.<p>The Greatest Generation is important.  So are the Baby Boomers, and my own Generation Xers.  And my son&#x27;s Millennials.  All important.<p>And complicated.  And conflicted.  We will find that every generation is generally laden with backwards cultural norms.<p>This article solidifies much that I already knew about the raw, life-long impact such things have on people.  It helps me understand my dad a little better.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to end this somewhat emotional ramble, so I&#x27;ll exhort everyone to embrace the complications and conflict that make up every person, of every generation.

This comes with the usual downsides of static binaries.<p>I&#x27;m interested in seeing it tried though.  The learning is in the doing.",1432065789

So people often get meaningful choice in a two party system.<p>Also of note, in some multi party systems like Britton a minority party’s can end up with vastly outstated control. EX: The largest party got < 37% of the vote but they are a clear majority right now.  One party got 3.8% of the vote and got 1 seat another got 4.7% of the vote and 56 seats.  <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/05/britain-s-election-2015-seats-votes-calculator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/05/britain...</a><p>PS: You really can&#x27;t design a voting system without clear downsides, but zero voting is clearly worse.",1432065783

But I didn&#x27;t do any background checks on the founders and the guy who recommended me to them I had known and worked with for a decade.<p>Fast forward 4 years later - I&#x27;m still quasi-employee #1 (and the only one, the 2 other part time contractors quit because as I learned later, they were tired of getting paid late), the company is now selling data to enterprise level customers (instead of to &#x27;consumers&#x27; in this market) so the workload has increased... and I&#x27;m working on weekends trying to keep up with the IT needs... while constantly being paid late.<p>I finally wised up / burnt out when it became apparent the CEO had &#x27;negotiated in bad faith&#x27; with a enterprise customer and they were threatening to sue unless they got exactly the data they&#x27;d paid for. Yes, I made a ton of mistakes and I hope no one else ever does what I did!  I ignored all the warnings signs over the years because I got so caught up in the work due to various personal stuff. The whole company (me and 2 salesguys) quit in the space of 2 months and had to go thru months of hell trying to get what we were owed.<p>The guy who introduced me to them finally decided he should have told me of the fraud the CEO pulled 30 years ago, the other founder (who has a criminal record as I recently found out) told me of the CEO&#x27;s fraud in his other business, one salesguy told me of the multiple identities the CEO was managing to make it seem like there were more employees...  the list goes on.<p>Character matters.  Contracts are worthless in comparison unless you have the resources (i.e. enough lawyers and money) to tangle with the other side - and bad actors know this fact, and how to twist contracts into balloon animals. Business ethics may be an oxymoron in the real world, but ... my story is a perfect example of why they should be fundamental / mandatory and the inherent flaws of capitalism.<p>Now the CEO has divorced his wife, who funded most of the company, and is trying to walk off with it having it valued at $350k, while a real estimate is that it&#x27;s worth a few million.",1432065692

My humble attempt at constructive criticism follows.<p>The ""play song"" overlay is too obtrusive.  It feels interruptive, which is what the transparency is trying to avoid.  Maybe make the X out button bigger and more prominent?<p>Also, does anyone know if there is a way to kill the Flex initialization and loading bar? It just feels amateur.<p>Finally, the biggest thing I'm looking for in a site like this is the ability to quickly download whole albums? Maybe you should cross-reference the album search with an index of the album, so as to ensure it only downloads one copy of each song, and have a one-button album download feature.<p>Also, isn't it a trivial process to determine which links are still live by seeing if each user plays through the song's entirety?",1208948374

Simple link count works well for evaluation of the importance of the web page until the Heisenberg effect kicks in (people start to adapt their pages to score better in the algorithm). My hunch is that it is enough to know the local structure of a densely-connected social graph.",1208947428

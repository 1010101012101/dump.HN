436090,comment,435230,435686,0,0,randallsquared,,,"""What do you do if, halfway through the year, the corporate board tells you to cut spending?""<p>Whatever you would otherwise have done.  If you have to lay people off, you lay people off.  Since the yearly pay is known in advance, the only odd bit is the schedule of payments... if you have to lay someone off, you've actually spent less than you would have if all their paychecks are the same.  But the details of all this aren't really the point -- I'm sure they could be worked out, if someone wanted to try it.  I may if I hire employees at some point.<p>Paying partly in equity seems nice, but it seems even less sustainable than distributing an employee's paycheck unevenly.",1232074760

436080,comment,436053,436053,0,0,lsc,,,"I dono... do you think you can compete better by marshaling lawyers?  or by implementing a product better and sooner?   How much of an opportunity cost does that money represent?  (I mean, do you need that funding to run?)<p>The big thing I see is that it takes money to be a patent troll.  I guess if the patent is really strong, you might be able to get your lawyers to work for a cut of the proceeds (maybe ask your lawyer?)  but that sounds unlikely to me, not that I know anything about patent trolling. if your resources are like mine, I'd not worry about the patent, and I'd focus on making something that is worth copying.<p>But yeah.  I'd argue that patent trolling is a lot like starting fist fights-  don't start if you can't win.  If you loose, you get nothing.  You just get a black eye and look like an asshole.   On the other hand, if you build a product and then get crushed by copycat competition with better resources, eh, you still learned something, and you still look good.  You created something that was worth copying. At the very least it helps you get your next job.<p>But then,  Maybe you have access to cheap lawyer time like I have access to cheap SysAdmin time.  that'd change the equation.",1232073685

436073,comment,435956,435956,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I just wanted to add that I <i>love</i> eMusic.  Holy crap, what a bunch of awesome it is.  I've been a subscriber since the first year it started, and I've never hesitated to re-up each year, as the selection just gets bigger, and the site just gets better and better at helping me find cool new music.  Growing up, I was the kind of kid that made the rounds of independent record stores every week just to check out the new releases and pick up a few underground classics from the used bins.  eMusic is like a drug for someone like me...and I spend as much each year as I used to spend per month at record stores, and end up with at least as much music that I love (because previewing is more efficient, reviews are right in front of me, and the cost per track is a bit lower than the average used CD).<p>The interesting thing to me is that it only took one study by a somewhat biased organization that believes strongly in, relies on, and supports, the ""blockbuster"" version of the music industry, for a large number of people to call ""the long tail"" bunk.  When you already know what outcome you want to see, and you have a very strongly vested interest in seeing that outcome, it'd be foolish for folks to take those results at face value...and yet, a lot of people have.",1232073150

436071,comment,436053,436053,0,0,mixmax,,,"I've started two companies that took out patents, and thus have seen this up close. My experience is:<p>- The market doesn't care about patents. Whether your product is good or bad a patent makes absolutely no difference to a customer.<p>- Competitors care very little about patents. They know the cost of patent litigation, and that you probably can't afford it. Even if you could they would probably be able to strike a deal.<p>- Investors, on the other hand, do care about patents. The thinking seems to go along the lones of <i>I have no idea which company to invest in, but the ones that have a patent must be the smart ones. So those are the ones I'll invest in</i>. - This is from Denmark, and may be different depending on your meatspace coordinates.<p>- Patents take time and focus. Patenting takes the focus off your product and selling it, and patents don't get you customers.<p>I would say that if you're gunning for investors get a patent, if you're not don't.<p>Hope it helps.<p>Edit: bonusinfo: If you have to go out and get a job at some point later in life a patent definitely helps. Employers are pretty impressed when you can say that you're so smart that you've taken out a patent...",1232072959

I don't know inner cities well enough to know whether that is true.<p>If we're going to cite problems, mine would be that the concept probably only works with one person. With any more, everybody has to coordinate what ""rooms"" are available and the dependency graphs could be quite odd. Can I cook breakfast if you're sleeping in? Can I get to the shower if you're watching a movie? I would expect that even two people would be significantly inconvenienced and three might just lock up due to contention.

436053,story,,,12,26,goodgoblin,"Ask HN: To Patent, or Not To Patent",,"We filed for a provisional patent a year ago, and the year is just about up, so we need to decide whether to go for the full patent.  Our lawyer is saying $5k for an opinion of counsel and then up to $10k more for the full patent.  This is basically all of our remaining capital and then some.  The patent, if we get it (82% were rejected last year), would theoretically protect us from competition if we could afford to litigate.  More likely it would serve as a reason for us to get bought.  If we don't go for the patent we won't have protection (not that it would come in for 3+ yrs or whatever), but we could still try and rule the market we are in.  A patent might also help us get funding, if we try and seek it (more funding, right now we've got friends and family money).  Needless to say, spending the rest of our money would put us in a tight spot.<p>Just wondering what HN's denizens thought of our situation or patents in general. thx.",1232071401

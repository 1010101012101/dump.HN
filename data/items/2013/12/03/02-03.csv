Sev:medium in security-researcher-land is XSS and CSRF, both of which probably merit thank-yous.

Nothing wrong with offering a place sell whatever. It&#x27;s bad in that the vast majority of them are junk coins and will die in short order.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t even consider trading in this world of alt-coins unless you know what you&#x27;re doing.  You should research each of them thoroughly and do your due diligence. You stand a very good chance of losing most of your investment in this sort of market.<p>They&#x27;re really like pink sheet stocks, which I traded back a decade or so ago.  I enjoyed that world, with its community of traders researching tiny, tiny, TINY companies to invest in. But like Pink Sheets, altcoins are the very definition of high risk. Even worse than pink sheets, altcoins are wholly unregulated and some may be outright scams.<p>As for the site itself, it&#x27;s had some serious growing pains the last few days. Nearly unusable at times, and last night entire order books were somehow wiped, which caused some confusion and some VERY sharp changes in price.<p>I think the founder is making a legitimate attempt at things, he may or may not be up to it.<p>I&#x27;m having fun, and making a bit of money, but I can&#x27;t recommend anyone else try it just yet.",1386038418

Transit routes are most efficient when structured as point-to-point.  I&#x27;ve seen several commuter systems in which buses collected riders over a small area, then travelled to a (preferably concentrated) business / commercial area where riders disembarked.  You limit loading/deloading and dwell times, and maximize time-in-motion (which increases net average speed).  Most urban transit systems achieve net speeds little over a walking pace (10-15 MPH isn&#x27;t uncommon) due to frequent stops and congestion.<p>The real killer with transit systems though is transfers.  Having to wait 5-10 minutes (or 20-30) for a connection <i>really</i> extends your commute time.  Realize that at highway speeds, that translates to 5-30 miles of commute distance, and even at urban speeds, 3-10 miles of lost travel distance.  To say nothing of the stress of wondering where the bus/train is and when / whether it will arrive.<p>So:  with an autonomous self-driving multiple-occupant vehicle, passengers could flag a ride, the dispatching system would match requests with livery by start and end points, and route accordingly.",1386037997

I didn&#x27;t really give much background information.<p>IE: I was having a conversation with some techie friends back when the SOPA scare was still at its peak. We were discussing purely hypothetical doomsday scenarios that would involve a &quot;darknet&quot; and the technical implications of creating an entirely subversive network. The idea was brought up that we could use our existing telephone infrastructure to send data, and only a way to transfer data via sound would need to be developed. This was shared amongst a few of the participants until I piped up and said &quot;you know dialup has done this already, right? The information is already there.&quot;<p>This is a conversation amongst people who are involved with and passionate about technology and are around my age or older. These are the kinds of people that I&#x27;d expect, if not to think of specifics right away, but to at least be lead to something that was as pervasive as dialup. True, I don&#x27;t expect an 18y/o of today to know or think about it, or even a 20y/o, but a 25+ hacker, developer, or general tech geek? I&#x27;m just surprised at how many in that former category just don&#x27;t remember it.",1386036624

Nokia created an appstore with N-Gage, it didn&#x27;t work and created a carrier backlash.<p>What Apple did was to stealth in their app store. It was all due to a strategic mistake by AT&T. Sure the Apple was a great device, but remember, the first version was 2G with a crappy camera and an amazing UI/UX and already seen as obsolete in developed 3G markets like Japan (I was working at Nokia in Japan at the time).<p>AT&T&#x27;s mistake? Unlike any previous carrier or vendor relationship, AT&T ceded control of software updates to Apple. Apple could update the phone any way they wanted. They already had enough market power in the US that would prevent carrier boycott. At the time, all the carriers were trying to copy Docomo and push out their own appstores, and this decision by AT&T killed it.<p>In terms of smartphones being a commodity, it already is, anything that sells int he hundreds of millions is effectively commoditized, that doesn&#x27;t prevent new players from coming in to try and disrupt the market. This is probably the third disruption in mobile phones, from dumbphones -> feature/early smartphones -> current smartphones, however it may be &#x27;too soon&#x27; as each cycle has been around for about 10 years each.",1386036515

I have a PT who uses chiropractic methods but I also have seen a chiropractor who does nothing but lower back manipulation and traction methods, both of which have evidence backing their methods to fix lower back mechanical issues. He is not a charlatan. It would be unfair to group him with the subluxation magicians.",1386036117

And few of these cases are high profile. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t working to protect people.<p>Second: What does that matter? I&#x27;m no lawyer, but I&#x27;m almost certain a law isn&#x27;t nullified as soon as one person gets away with breaking it. 23andMe is pretty high-profile. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much a part of the tech entrepreneur inner-circle their founders may be, if they&#x27;re doing something that might be harmful or misleading, it&#x27;s completely appropriate for legal remedies to be explored. Especially when it sounds like they&#x27;re thumbing their noses at the rather polite requests of the FDA.",1386036047

There are plenty of chiropractors who perform manual therapy and spinal manipulation to fix mechanical low back issues - and there is a LOT of evidence behind these methods. They don&#x27;t delve into the bullshit subluxation theories.<p>That isn&#x27;t &quot;physiotherapy.&quot; That is quite clearly chiropractic medicine. And in that regard, it works. Just section them off into subluxation believers and people who work on lower backs. That&#x27;s how I split them, considering I refer my clients to chiros all the time (and use them myself for my herniated lumbar discs).",1386036046

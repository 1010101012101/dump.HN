Before becoming president, you make promises, have goals, and overall think you know what you're going to do on day one.<p>However, after inauguration you go for your first big debriefing with the CIA, FBI, etc... The things you learn there completely change the course what you want to do, or can do. You find that we were constantly in significantly more danger than any citizen could have anticipated.<p>Now, I don't find this to be likely, but just something I've considered. Why in the world would have Obama gone from wanting to close Gitmo, to being pretty much against it? Politics alone don't seem to cover it, since pretty much everyone wants it closed. Logistics?

5551783,comment,5551257,5551555,10,0,lispm,,,"COBOL, Fortran, C++, Ada... were the scripting languages of what exactly?<p>If I were staying in your argument, then Lisp was the language of symbolic AI. The language where things like symbolic mathematics (Macsyma, Reduce, ...), planners, theorem provers, natural language understanding, reasoning systems, expert systems, knowledge-based systems (Cyc, ...) were explored and first tried to commercialize (mid 80s). Symbolic AI funding went away with the cold war ending...<p>Lisp was actually invented and designed for this. John McCarthy was designing Lisp as a vehicle for (his) AI research.<p>There might still be a lot of Lisp users. Even among AI researchers (and related domains) there are many using Lisp tools which you probably have never heard of - like ACL2 (a theorem prover), PVS (a theorem prover used at NASA), ACT-R (a cognitive architecture with more publications written about then you can ever read). The usage of Lisp may even be constant in these domains. There was an explosion of programming in general. Outside these domains Lisp never really participated in this explosion (with a few exceptions like Lisp in Autocad, Lisp in Emacs, ...).<p>But should it? Lisp's almost unbounded flexibility is obviously not needed by the average programmer. It is actually a something which makes a bad programmer worse.<p>'Lisp Machines' were just one development/deployment platform - 10000 sold in a decade. Lisp was used before Lisp Machines and after Lisp Machines.<p>> It never became the scripting language of something else that was exploding in popularity.<p>Autocad sold millions of copies and is still widely used today. Several Autocad 'clones' support the use of Lisp for CAD scripting.",1366037807

How would we go about empirically measuring whether too much power"" is harmful?<p>Do we give 100 teams a task to accomplish in Lisp, but tell 50 of them that they can't write their own macros? Or tell 50 of them that they can't use continuations?<p>If continuations correlated negatively with success, how would we know whether continuations are ""too powerful,"" or merely ""poorly designed?"" (There is a lot of talk these days about whether continuations are a ""Turing Tar Pit"" and that a better mechanism needs to be invented)<p>Or perhaps our 100 programmers are merely unfamiliar with them, and as a result don't use the features well?<p>My feeling when I consider thought experiments like this is that it is very difficult to define expressions like ""too powerful"" with precision. This imprecision leads to the effect where we twist our explanations to suit ur biases.<p>So if we think Lisp is ""too powerful"" and that it failed in some sense, the lack of precision around ""power"" and ""failure"" allow us to draw whatever conclusion we like about the relationship between the terms.",1366037798

Thats the whole point of autoloading - to load a class file when the class is not defined.<p>Of course, if projects adopted namespaces and sensible file naming, they wouldn't need their own autoload classes at all - SPL handles it out of the box with between one and three lines of code:<p><pre><code>    set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . MY_INCLUDE_ROOT); // if your include path needs to be set specifically
    spl_autoload_extensions('.class.php,.interface.php,' . spl_autoload_extensions()); // if you prefer class/interface files to have a suffix

But there was a time when I did not use Facebook, but still kept in touch with friends and family. I transitioned to Facebook because it worked better than the previous technologies I used (snail mail, phone, email, MySpace, etc.).<p>There was nothing magically unique about that transition; it could happen again if someone makes something better than Facebook.<p>I actually don't think Facebook is a great example of rent-seeking because Facebook makes so little rent...Zuckerberg is rich on paper because of how he played the investment market, not the rent he charges on his product. Facebook's profits are very small.<p>Microsoft or Apple are probably better examples, but even those fail the typical definition of ""rent-seeking"", which is economic activity that is captured by regulatory exclusion. Neither Microsoft nor Apple achieved their position because the government mandated that everyone must use Windows or iTunes. They achieved their position by out-competing the alternatives.<p>It's true that once they were on top, they were harder to defeat. But that does not make them rent-seekers. And historically this sort of advantage tends to be pretty temporary. History is full of dominant companies that are no longer around.

Which is usually pretty low.<p>The worst part is that if you can't find the people to occupy your apartment your costs are pretty low (you don't have a profit but that's not the same as money being drained from your account). So you can buy and hold apartment for years at very low cost. This creates artificial scarcity (in addition to actual scarcity) of places to live that keeps the prices up.<p>I think progressive property tax would enliven real estate trade. Prices would drop and more ordinary people could afford to buy one on credit instead of renting. This could save working people a lot of money so they can actually start their lives instead of slaving on their first job with just enough money to pay the rent.<p>Tax should be constructed in such way that holding even large apartment, or even two or three would pose no burden or almost no burden, but you might be better of selling your fifth apartment even at 50% below market price than holding it for a year.",1366037554

You're right about everything you say (if only you glossed over notable exceptions like Java or C++), but we're discussing ""power"", not popularity.<p>Unfortunately, power has a very positive connotation. As a programmer, wouldn't you want to use a more ""powerful"" tool? However it's different when it comes to programming languages. Too much power can hurt you. Realising that there can be such a thing as ""too much power"" is new to me or at the very least, it's counter-intuitif enough to deserve being debated. That's the point of, or at least that what I take away from, this page.<p>Arguably, the success of Java comes from its complete lack of Lisp-y power. Python may be ""powerful"", it makes a big deal to enforce the ""one way to do it"" culture and has always had a love/hate relationship with functional features for this exact reason. Speaking from experience, I find it easier to read and understand Java or Python than I do Lisp or Lua (another ""powerful"" language where every project will inevitably implement its own object model, basically rebuilding Python or Ruby).<p>So yes, I believe that there's a spectrum of ""power"" between programming languages, and more ""power"" isn't necessarily better. It's a characteristic, nothing more.<p>But more importantly, I wish we could start discussing and comparing programming languages without talking about something as meaningless and volatile as popularity. I don't care if my favorite language becomes the most popular. I don't want to unify all programming languages into one. I am happy when different languages solve the same problems differently, more or less elegantly, and I have so much fun learning all these approaches. I don't care what ""succeeded"" and what ""worked"".<p>I sincerely mean no offense, but I'm tired of having people cut the debate short by turning any meaningful comparison into a popularity contest.",1366036740

You don't ""work with"" software engineers. We don't even ""work with"" each other. If you don't learn anything else from this, get this: we work alone. Always. Even when we think we don't. Sure, we occasionally get together to plan, analyze, discuss, white board, even ""pair program"" whatever that means, but sooner or later, we all sit down alone and do what we do. With that in mind...<p>2. Leave us the fuck alone! If you see a software engineer looking at a screen and typing, that means we're BUSY. Do not interrupt. Do not call. Do not text. Do not IM. Do ask if we're busy (WE are!). Do not tap us on our shoulder. And whatever you do, don't just stand there waiting for us to stop typing (We won't; that's a test of wills you will lose). Just send an email. That's it. When we break, we'll check email and reply. If you don't write well enough to communicate with us, then learn how to.<p>(If my language seems a little strong, it's because I feel so strongly about this. Nothing is more frustrating to us than having work to do and being kept from doing it when we want to. We often need large blocks of time and room to focus deeply.)<p>3. Don't try to understand how we work, what makes us tick, what turns us on, or the ""secret"" to making us more productive. a. All those things are different for every one of us. b. We don't even know what they are ourselves.<p>4. Don't patronize us. Sure, we all appreciate beer, donuts, chocolate, and foosball, just like everybody else, but don't bother trying to get something from us with a gimmick. It may work once or twice, but then never again. That shit doesn't even work on your dog. Why do you think it would work with us?<p>5. Provide us with the resources we need. This is pretty binary. Do this and get results. Don't do this and don't get results. For the most part, we're fairly easy. A comfortable chair. A decent machine. Good lighting. Fresh air or HVAC. Peace and quiet. Decent facilities. Specs or requirements > 50% accurate. (Forget about 100% accurate; none of us has ever seen that; we'll live with 50-80%.).<p>6. When we tell you we need something, believe us!.If we need clarification on something, get it. If we need more time, give it to us. If we need access to someone/something, make it happen.<p>7. Never lie to us. We are used to our machines always telling the truth. We insist on no less from other humans.<p>8. Contrary to common belief, we do not hate the following classes of things, we just hate idiotic instances of them: meetings, status reports, timesheets, processes, procedures, policies, mission statements, motivational posters, HR, reviews, interviews, reports, specs, and team-building exercises.<p>9. The best thing you could possibly do for us: everything you must and not one thing more.<p>10. Top ten lists suck (except this one).",1366036710

The ship had the power to self-replicate; it also carried a small defensive weapon and a powerful lightning-bolt type tool for breaking-down and gathering resources for ship replication.  The Slylandro wanted more probes faster so they turned the replication priority up to 11, overriding all other priorities.  When a ship meets you, it attempts to initiate contact but is quickly forced into resource-gathering/replication mode & proceeds with breaking apart your ship into raw components.

But in my experience very few latency problems I've come across are down to language choice vs. badly written database queries, lack of caching etc.</i><p>5 ms you save in your runtime -- for free, without any work on your part -- is 5 ms longer you can now afford to spend waiting on the database.<p>> <i>But there are also plenty of situations where in-memory queues are also not acceptable, and the moment you hit disk, the entire performance profile shifts so dramatically that you suddenly often have much more flexibility.</i><p>I can only disagree here. I view CPU cycles and memory as a bank account. If you waste them on an inefficient runtime, you can't spend them elsewhere, and there are <i>always</i> places where they can be spent.<p>Excluding huge sections of the problem domain -- such as ""decoding/encoding framed packet data"" -- is a cop-out. There's no valid reason for it, unless you're going to go so far as to claim that Ruby/Python et al increase developer efficiency over other language's baselines <i>so dramatically</i> that it outweighs the gross inefficiency of the languages.",1366036044

The goal is to create value while you can and leave a legacy that allows newer and better institutions (formed decades or centuries later, so perhaps long after individual death) to learn from it.<p>I've written a lot about the concept of <i>simple trust</i>. Essentially, it means trusting people to do their work and generally do the right thing. It doesn't mean you'd hand them a suitcase with $5 million in it; it means you think the person is competent and not an idiot or scumbag. Not all trust is binary, but simple trust (""bozo bit"") is, and it's also symmetric and usually transitive, so it becomes systemic. It's actually binary across a company (trust-dense or trust-sparse) and I think those tie into K- and r-selection.<p>If you don't have simple trust, you'll end up with a company where employees are treated badly, so they treat it badly (as they should) and it eventually fails.",1366035782

Are there any of these arguments that you haven't heard at least <i>once</i> in the last eight years about Ruby? That it's too powerful, that programmers make their own idiosyncratic worlds, that programs are too complicated to understand, &c. &c.<p>Yet, somehow, There is tons of working Ruby code in production and people have found a way to harness its power. People are awfully clever, I very much doubt that any serious language (i.e. a language not designed to confuse) can't be whipped into shape by a team of reasonable people who are motivated to succeed.<p>The ""failure"" of Lisp has a very simple explanation, so simple that people gloss over it. Every successful language began as the scripting language of some system that was itself exploding in popularity.<p>To be a hit, a language must arrive in the mass market's consciousness in tandem with its ""platform."" Objective C failed until the iPhone was a hit. C was a hit with Unix and then Windows. Ruby was a hit when Rails was a hit.<p>Lisp was the scripting language of Lisp machines. When the ""AI Winter"" hit Lisp machines, it hit Lisp.

Must a scripting language be interpreted? Is Java interpreted? What about JIT techniques for JavaScript? When we transpile CoffeeScript to JavaScript, what is going on? I have a CPU that executes microcode. Is ASM for this CPU really an interpreted language?<p>All good stuff. By the way, Lisp was originally interpreted, compilers didn't come along until later. So...

There are a few people doing HFT research with zipline, and there's a lot of work to do. At quantopian (my day job), we focus on longer hold periods, so there is room in the zipline ecosystem for you to do HFT.<p>The main benefit we've found with python as the algo language is that it allows for stat programming with pandas, but also OO or functional programming for the algo logic. This smoothes the transition from research to production, just as you're describing with R -> haskell, but you can stay in one language.<p>I think one of the biggest potential wins with parallelization is if you can assume all positions are closed overnight, most often true for HFT. That way, you can simulate all the trading days in a test range in parallel. This is quite similar to the parallel processing we do to handle the large number of concurrent backtests running at quantopian. We did all of that with python, but I'd be fascinated to see it done with haskell.",1366035213

dropped.""<p>A few more occurrences of the term and we get to section 3.2 ""Haskell is pure"" which says ""Necessity being the mother
of invention, this embarrassment ultimately led to the invention of
monadic I/O, which we now regard as one of Haskells main contributions to the world, as we discuss in more detail in Section 7.""<p>""Section 3.8 Haskell and Miranda ... More fundamentally, Haskell did not adopt Mirandas abstract data types, using the module system instead (Section 5.3); added monadic I/O (Section 7.2); and incorporated many
innovations to the core Hindley-Milner type system, especially type
classes (Section 6).""<p>""Section 6.4 Higher-kinded polymorphism
The rst major, unanticipated development in the type-class story
came when Mark Jones, then at Yale, suggested parameterising a
class over a type constructor instead of over a type, an idea he
called constructor classes (Jones, 1993). The most immediate and
persuasive application of this idea was to monads ... Joness paper appeared in 1993, the same year that monads became
popular for I/O (Section 7). The fact that type classes so directly
supported monads made monads far more accessible and popular; and dually, the usefulness of monadic I/O ensured the adoption
of higher-kinded polymorphism""<p>The entire Section 7 is called ""Monads and input/output""<p>Section 7.3 ""Monadic I/O
Although Wadlers development of Moggis ideas was not directed
towards the question of input/output, he and others at Glasgow soon

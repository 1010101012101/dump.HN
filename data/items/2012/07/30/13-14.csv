Despite advances modern browsers are making with Web Sockets support, the current compatibility is not there yet.<p>For starters, IE has no support, though that is starting to change with IE10. But the biggest issue is with personal firewalls / corporate proxies. These are unfortunately quite horrible at handling Web Sockets. Many popular firewalls such as avast! and Bitdefender cant handle the WS protocol and completely blocks traffic despite browser support and it being valid HTTP.\nThe socket.io guys did some extensive research on what firewalls are causing these issues. I dont think their list is exhaustive but it features most major personal firewalls out there. Have a look at <a href=""https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/wiki/Socket.IO-and-firewall-software"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/wiki/Socket.IO-and-f...</a> , it's no reading of joy.<p>Ive deployed quite large installations of Beaconpush (a push server incidentally based on Netty as well). First going from Web Sockets with fallback, over to pure WS and were looking at going back to using fallbacks once again due to these incompatibility issues. This time we are looking at using SockJS instead of rolling our own (to be fair, there were no open-source libs doing this when we started). Ive ported SockJS to Netty (<a href=""https://github.com/cgbystrom/sockjs-netty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cgbystrom/sockjs-netty</a>) and its working although I wouldnt say it is production ready.<p>I urge you to have a look at SockJS and socket.io. Personally I prefer SockJS since it aims at emulating the Web Socket interface and nothing more as compared to socket.io (which adds a pub/sub layer). Also, it does not rely on a Flash fallback (which is another story). The socket.io guys are however working on engine.io, which will split the transport fallback mechanisms of socket.io to a separate library. That's a good idea, but it still uses Flash and IMHO a more complex ""transport upgrade"".",1343655075

Journalists are also using these services to report news very quickly and from the location of the event.<p>The idea is to build an emergency-type social notification tool that would notify the world when a journalist or an activist is under a threat.<p>A usage scenario: a journalist went undercover to a hot area (like Syria). They would use the service/app to create an emergency situation (before they go) in which they specify where they're going, how long it should take, and a notifier & an action, like (If I don't tweet in 1 hour then let the world know that I'm in danger). The notifier could be anything from FS checkin, tweet, FB post, instagram photo, etc. and the action could have multiple options like tweet something, send a DM to someone, or something like that.",1343654894

Being able to ship (server) software as a single JAR file with everything you need embedded makes life a lot easier.  It is very nice not having to fiddle around setting up servlet containers, configuring them, deploying applications into them and then, inevitably, having to restart everything when a rogue application decides to ruin the party for everyone.  (And it just gets worse when you try to automate it).<p>One thing I'm still looking for is a good skeletal project for a REST server making use of JAX-RS annotations, Netty and having support for asynchronous request handling.

The $35 or whatever OEMs pay for Windows 8 becomes part of their manufacturing costs. When Microsoft makes their own design, they essentially don't have that cost.<p>Google can afford to sell at thin margins because they make most of their money off advertising. The more Android units out there, the more ads they can display. Microsoft hasn't yet cracked the post-sales revenue problem; once the OS is sold it goes into the hands of the OEM who tends to make their money off hardware upsells, crapware preinstalls, service contracts, etc. So, Microsoft can't discount their Windows 8 licenses to near-zero without the risk of making <i>nothing</i> on the deal.<p>If you read further down into the article, I think that is what the ""services"" part of the 10-K is implying. Microsoft is looking for a way to slice off some of that post-sale revenue. An easy way to do that, obviously, is to make their own hardware, but it will be even more interesting to see how they transition from their OS-licensing revenue model to a post-sale-services revenue model.",1343654753

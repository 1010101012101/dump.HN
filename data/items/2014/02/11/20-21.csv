7220398,comment,7219872,7220260,50,0,bradleyjg,,,"It&#x27;s bad in more ways than one. Not only do you eventually hit a wall in the subjects you are naturally gifted in and find yourself without the skills to keep going, you also probably avoided the subjects your weren&#x27;t naturally gifted in. So for example, maybe you can&#x27;t keep going in math because you can no longer do it in your head and never learned how to do it on paper, but you also never learned to write well, so moving over to some liberal arts major isn&#x27;t going to be any walk in the park either. Even if you find something else that you are really good at, you are only keeping the house of cards standing a little longer.<p>Although this may be just deflecting the blame, I do think that the educational system in the US by and large poorly serves gifted children. The underlying notion seems to be that gifted children are already ahead of the game and so don&#x27;t deserve any special attention. Another piece of the puzzle is grading-as-certification rather than grading-as-progress report or some other scheme. Straight As can mask a lot of problems.",1392152307

It&#x27;s not so much about studying as it is about finding subjects and venues of learning that just kick your ass. If you don&#x27;t have the experience of getting your intellectual butt kicked, and if you don&#x27;t have the ability to learn from the experience, you can only grow so much.<p>The easy stuff shouldn&#x27;t be avoided; you should just expect yourself to pick it up as necessary. If you are not getting challenged, if you don&#x27;t encounter people who are way ahead of you in some subjects, then you are doing it wrong. The feedback is key. Getting stopped in your tracks, just when you thought you were running along at a good clip is invaluable.<p>Not that I ever achieved greatness, and I do sometimes ask myself why, even in my private life, I always pick the really hard to study (and have for decades now).

Poof - all gone, with more or less proper security measures in place and no clear sign of an intruder other than the missing money.  Several other people reported similar events in that thread.<p>These are still major problems for mass adoption of crypto, completely setting aside the massive cases of fraudulent pools, online wallets, exchanges, etc., etc.  There are many subtle problems that are difficult to diagnose and cure that come with a technological solution like bitcoin, that paper money simply does not have.",1392152228

I never learned to do algebra &quot;by the book,&quot; because I didn&#x27;t need to. Or maybe because I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to.<p>The math teacher would teach &quot;3x + 6 = 9.&quot; Basic algebraic problem-solving says you subtract the 6 from both sides, then divide by 3. So &quot;3x = 3&quot; then &quot;x = 1.&quot; Easy. But I learned pretty early on that I could do it in my head. It was a little bit challenging, but then I wouldn&#x27;t have to waste the time of writing it out, and I wasn&#x27;t handicapped like all of those suckers who had to go through the motions no matter how simple the problem was. If the teacher wrote &quot;x + 1 = 6&quot; I didn&#x27;t have to subtract 1 from each side, I just thought about it logically and knew the answer. Of course, the math got more complex, but I was good enough at doing it in my head that, at least for a long time, it never really mattered.<p>I thought it was because I just &quot;got&quot; math, and the other kids were on a lower level. But as the math grew in complexity, I fell behind. By the time we reached Calculus I was still doing most of it in my head, as I had never <i>really</i> learned to write it out on paper. And the complexity of the math outgrew my capacity to visualize. I showed up to my AP calculus test without a calculator, partially because I was forgetful and partly for fun, and it wasn&#x27;t until I got my score back (a failing 2 of 5) that it finally hit me: I was actually behind. In school. I was cocky enough that this was a slap in the face.<p>I had to start from scratch, and I&#x27;m still not sure if I&#x27;ve made up for a lot of that. I ended up in more creative fields, mostly because I felt inferior to those who had learned the rules and not been cocky douchebags like I had been in the beginning.<p>This really sucks to write.

It&#x27;s easy to plug numbers in without really understanding what they mean, and also believing a number that is several orders of magnitude out. And after the first week of converting between micro and nano and pico you&#x27;ll have a good grasp on what those numbers mean.<p>2) draw circuits by hand.  You&#x27;ll be working on small circuits and drawing them is a bit like the &quot;learn whTever the hardway&quot; approach of typing stuff in.<p>3) for analogue DC circuits it&#x27;s about manipulating current, voltage, resistance.  For ac circuits it&#x27;s power and impedance.  For digital it&#x27;s 1s and 0s and timing.<p>3a) in context components serve a role - decoupling or current limiting or amplifying or etc etc.  you get to learn the configuration of a few components means an amplifier, and so you know that a voltage across those pins means a bigger voltage across those other pins.<p>Years ago the advice was to grab some second hand equipement and some new components and a breadboard and make circuits.  The eauipment would be a powersupply, an oscilloscope, a signal generator, maybe a multimeter.  The components would be a few resistors and capacitors and transistors with so e 555s and 741s. (With a few 4xxx series thrown in).  Nowadays there is almost certainly a virtual set of this stuff that you can run on a computer.  Perhaps some HN reader is involved in it?<p>The Art of Electronics (and the Student Lab book) used to be a solid introduction - hard work but good.

A pending message may be changed before its delivered, altering the hash. This makes the hash unsuitable for identifying pending messages.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;So how do I identify messages?&quot;<p>Them: &quot;Ideally you wait until they&#x27;re delivered, but if you really need to check for pending messages, you can search through them looking for a message that matches on to, from and content.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;That kinda sucks.&quot;<p>Them: &quot;We know, but it&#x27;s a difficult issue to fix.

There&#x27;s no deterministic method that you can use to crank out the &quot;right answer&quot;.<p>- At a lower level, the same applies to choosing algorithms: Will an algorithm that&#x27;s much simpler to implement but provides reasonable average performance over most of the cases I need to handle be better than a complex algorithm that will take much longer to implement? Are there heuristics that can help me solve a problem that&#x27;s computationally intractable? The answer frequently comes from intuition.<p>- When debugging, being able to quickly narrow down the possible causes of bugs (is it a memory leak? a race condition? a compiler bug?) requires a lot of intuition.

Expect those companies to appear (unless regulators start messing up with exchanges). If they don&#x27;t appear, it means there&#x27;s not enough demand. If there&#x27;s no demand for audit and government is still trying to regulate the industry, it means they&#x27;re wasting taxpayers money on something taxpayers don&#x27;t want.",1392148911

Time will tell how the experiment will pan out, but even if most projects fail, my gut is that at least a few will succeed in the long run.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mastercoin.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mastercoin.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://coloredcoins.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coloredcoins.org/</a>",1392148830

Some of the remote developer studies are hilariously out dated.<p>Maybe there's a generation gap (People who grew up with IM/IRC can naturally use it communicate better?) or my experience is too colored by working only remote my whole career, but between the places I worked without distributed workflows and those I hear about from my friends in the industry, my anecdotal evidence says distributed teams are far far more effective.",1361581176

5267970,comment,5262388,5264208,1,0,justin66,,,"> That's not a lie. The actual meaning of the question question is if you have officially ever been arrested. And the answer is no, that arrest is no longer official.<p>That's completely incorrect. An ""official"" arrest (what is its opposite? I wouldn't want to experience an unofficial arrest) doesn't stop being ""official,"" although the record of it might be deleted or sealed. Nobody can make an arrest retroactively not happen, they can just remove the record of it.<p>But this brings up something important, and it might be the cause of your confusion. An arrest is just an arrest. It can happen to anyone, and importantly, it can happen to a person who is innocent both in reality and in the eyes of the law. Arrest records don't really mean what a lot of people think they mean: it's the courts, not the police, who decide guilt and innocence.<p>This is why asking people about arrests, or using arrest information for pretty much any purpose except police investigation, is fundamentally flawed.",1361581143

I attribute that to the heavy use of Habanero pepper, which is pretty damn hot, but Habaneros don't actually taste very good.<p>I've discovered a nice combination, however, that can be both hotter and taste better.  Scotch Bonnet peppers[1] are widely used in the Caribbean Islands, and are <i>almost</i>, but not quite, as hot as as Habaneros, but they taste MUCH better.  OTOH, Naga Jolokia ""Ghost Pepper"" peppers[2] are much hotter than Habaneros, and taste, well... not any <i>worse</i> than Habaneros, at worst.  So, if you want to jazz something up to nuclear hot levels and keep it tasting good, load it down with Scotch Bonnet and then add just a few drips of Naga Jolokia pepper sauce.<p>This has become my ""go to"" combination for making really hot tex-mex type dishes, curries, etc.  Yumm....<p>FWIW, my favorite brand for both (at least partly because it's available retail locally) is the ""Tropical Pepper Co. brand)[3][4].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_bonnet_%28pepper%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_bonnet_%28pepper%29</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_Bhut_Jolokia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_Bhut_Jolokia</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://tropicalpepper.com/product.asp?idProduct=94"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tropicalpepper.com/product.asp?idProduct=94</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://tropicalpepper.com/product.asp?idProduct=135"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tropicalpepper.com/product.asp?idProduct=135</a>",1361581081

There's really not much cognitive dissonance involved.<p>It reminds me of a friend of mine who grew up around poor people and was aware of how they struggle with money. Her family wasn't in poverty, but they weren't flush with money either. At around age 30, she made her way into the finance industry and started pulling down six figures. She mentioned that she got a raise recently, but had been infected by the finance mindset that any raise is tainted by the marginal tax rate, and was bitching that 'half of it went to the government' (for values where .37 = half, it seems).<p>Anyway, her version of the story went 'the government taxes so much money out that I can't give as much to my single-mother sister who is scraping by on welfare - they should lower taxes [for this reason]'. I asked what about all the other single mothers our there that don't have sisters in high finance - reducing the tax yield would mean they get less. My friend changed her tune pretty fast and realised that hey, she was actually in a good position and should be positive about it instead of negative.<p>The thing is, my friend wasn't someone who grew up amongst wealth, she knew what it was like to be poor, and she herself had worked the same shitty jobs as poor people everywhere. She was smart, and knew deeply about social opportunity (she dated a fiery, forthright anarchist for many years).

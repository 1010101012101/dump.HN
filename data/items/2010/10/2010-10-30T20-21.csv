If you can take the majority of people out of the current overkill security theatre, that means they can go through standard-level security queues quickly (note no one is proposing dropping security here). 
I dread standing in the densely packed security lines at DIA. A single suicide bomber could kill several hundred people on a busy day there without ever passing a security checkpoint (as the author points out this is now the bigger risk). If you can reduce the number of people who need to remove shoes, liquids and have back-scatter and pat-downs to a small minority, then everyone will be safer.
I'm a libertarian (in the Jefferson sense). But I agree to reasonable security checks voluntarily by choosing to fly. But invasion of privacy has gone too far when someone makes me walk through a Dick Measuring Machine or is ""meeting resistance"" for the sake of public relations theatre.",1288472184

Individuals are bidding up prices without any financial information or real competitive market.<p>However, I think the public markets will be more efficient, and have more complete financial information. My guess is that the public markets will not value Facebook, or other high flying private companies, at a much higher valuation. In fact, I think the public markets could value these companies at substantially less.<p>In the end that is what makes a market, buyers and sellers, all with different opinions. It is impossible to say who is right at this time.<p>My point is that private valuations have been driven up far higher than ever before for three basic reasons;
1.) Lack of IPO market has driven the creation of new markets
2.) 409A has required companies to value their stock at much higher valuations than ever before.
3.) Second Market allows individuals to buy private stock, and bid up prices, without complete financial information.<p>Time will tell how efficient or accurate these alternative markets really are. My guess is the gap between private valuation and IPO public valuation has narrowed considerably, and we will not see the IPO price bounce we saw in the past. Just a guess. Time will tell.<p>Don Dodge",1288472158

For example, praise from other researchers, or extensive citation of the published paper, could be indirect evidence of nonobviousness.<p>(One of my partners at my former law firm told a story about representing a major university in seeking a patent for a biotech invention. It took a number of years for the PTO to do the initial examination of the patent application. The patent examiner perfunctorily rejected the application, asserting that the claimed invention would have been obvious in view of the prior art. My partner responded that in the years that the inventors had been waiting on the PTO to examine the patent application, they had been awarded the Nobel Prize for that very invention. Result: Obviousness rejection withdrawn. Of course, I could well be misremembering, but it nicely illustrates the principle.)",1288471929

To use the gp's expression, they have physics envy when they need to be demanding statistics and psychology. The problem area is difficult and overpopulated, and what's worse, worth money. That means that the most apt people do business for themselves instead of suggesting on the business of others.<p>Much of economics is useful, but little is reliable.

1851744,comment,1850894,1850894,0,0,tsiki,,,"Lots of good (and bad) advice here already, but here are my 5 cents:<p>Being more outgoing. There are two steps here that need to work for that to happen: you need to like the person you are in social situations, and you can't care about what people think of you.<p>To elaborate on the first point, you need to enjoy social situations. Don't go into social situations to ""meet friends"" or get ""rid of you social anxiety"" - go into them to have fun (here the second step needs to be in order, but more about that later). If you have fun, you'll meet people who you think are fun to be around with - and there's a good chance they think the same of you at that point. Also, liking the person you are usually includes things like not being arrogant etc (for most people anyway).<p>The second point: don't care about what people think of you. This doesn't mean you shouldn't care about what people think - they can have interesting, magnificent, cool ideas, but it's just their opinion of you that shouldn't matter. As long as you like the person you are (see point above), no one else's opinion should matter. I have maybe 5 people in my life whom I'd listen to if they said seriously commented on something about me. It's very hard to express yourself openly and have fun if there's something in the back of your mind telling you how you should care about what all the people present think of you.<p>In my experience, you can't have one without the other. Both of those need to be in order to actually enjoy being around people.<p>Then, your study habits (remembering crap when trying to study). I had (well, have to some degree) the exact same problem as you. I can't say I've found the magic bullet, but I think I've got the basic psychology down. Think about what you do when that train of thought starts to appear? I'd bet good money you hold out for a while, but eventually give in and watch a movie/new episode of House/play WoW/etc. That's a pattern your mind has learned over the time: if you start thinking about crap you'll eventually get rewarded with the latest antics of that funny doctor. Breaking that pattern is hard, but if you have got the socialization part down, it becomes easier, as you have much less embarrasing things to care about. As soon as you start thinking those thoughts, you need to redirect them to the task at hand. And again. And again.<p>Throughout all of this, one important skill is redirecting your thoughts. Find yourself at a party, thinking if the thing you just said was maybe a bit awkward? You need to redirect your thoughts to the task at hand, having fun. Talking to a new friend, thinking how you should respond so he'd think good of you? See previous action. Thinking about crap while studying? Redirect your thoughts to that funny thing that happened last week or the task at hand.<p>Obviously it'll take a long time before you change your thought patterns permanently, but don't despair, you're only 21.",1288470850

It was because of those ""not all"" cases that I wanted to give some people the benefit of the doubt, at least for the first. If it's an ""all"", or at least very close to it, as you're suggesting, then I understand the need and revoke those parts of my statement.",1288468999

Not only does it allow the use of unicode in identifiers, but it uses them extensively throughout its standard library. After using Agda for a while, one quickly realises that most of the issues raised in this thread are rather unimportant. Having extra brackets, more equality symbols and greek letters available really does make code nicer to read when used judiciously.",1288468987

I mean, many languages require many more symbols than keys on a keyboard, and are used every day by millions of people who are not programmers and without any particular technical skill (think Japanese and Chinese).<p>Practically, having to regularly deal with Japanese encoding, a big issue is interoperability. Granted, a lot of issues are caused by not using unicode (unix vs windows encodings which sadly are still pervasive), and those could be mitigated by enforcing unicode.<p>I am not so much concerned about readability: mathematics go away with tons and tons of symbols, and it is not really ambiguous  - certainly less so than most programming language syntaxes I know.",1288468857

(Java, I'm looking at you.)<p>Seriously, though, it might be worth the OP's time to go light on classes, and look for some programming task that's <i>fun.</i> Find something cool. I've been really enjoying node.js, for example, because the community feels like a city full of still-under-construction buildings, with oddly dressed people smiling and lurching around spasmodically, occasionally making something amazing.<p>If you optimize for fun, you'll learn a lot faster than you would in most regular classes.",1288468823

Hell, it doesn't even have to be limited to mobile devices (but supported resolutions, features, and device support should be prominent).<p>There's clearly a huge market for systems that make it easy for customers to find and purchase apps, and for devs to reach those customers. People shouldn't be implementing payment systems over and over again for each product they create. It gives devs exposure and a market base.<p>I guess the problem is bootstrapping such a market.

1272437,comment,1271739,1272418,0,0,wdewind,,,"The key here is less limited $ and more limited attention span.  We simply don't have enough time to consume both our user created content (facebook etc) AND still support pay content as well.  Pixar absolutely has expertise over movie making, and I'm not saying they particularly are going anywhere, but the competition they have is NOT with other movie companies, it's with ALL media for attention span.<p>When you bring the long tail into this, and as it gets easier and easier to create what we would call ""quality"" media for a smaller, fragmented audience, it's going to be very difficult for consumers to see the value of a Time magazine-like broad, high level view of the world.  This IS going to be competition for companies like Pixar because the choice isn't ""I have 10 movies to see pick one,"" it's ""how should I spend my day,"" and it's going to be rarer and rarer that the answer to that is go see the new mass market movie.<p>Now of course we are years ahead of the curve here.  HNers tend to be pushing boundaries on stuff like this.  So there are still a few years before places outside of metro America catch up.<p>I DON'T agree with you about the MPAA and RIAA.  Their goal is not to protect long term, it's simply to slow this transition down so they lose fewer jobs and have more time to think about it.  They NEED to because they represent the mega companies that need to move this slow.  Think of it like a two lane highway, MPAA and RIAA are side to side trucks driving at 5mph.  We'll just keep hitting detours and exits and eventually there will simply be no one behind them.  So I think their goal is wrong, but I think they've succeeded in carrying out their mission relatively well.",1271469069

Something like: ""Walmart gets to choose the items they place on their shelves, so why should the App Store be any different?"".<p>In fact, Walmart is fairly picky about what they put on their shelves, especially when it comes to music CDs. We can argue that Walmart's control on the CDs it distributes might have a stifiling effect on the type of music that gets released. However, Walmart is not the only place allowed to sell CDs. Yes, it might suck that you have to make a Walmart-specific release of your album, but that doesn't prevent you from releasing a more explicit version elsewhere.<p>This is not the case with the App Store.",1271468755

So if I have limited dollars and/or attention to spend on entertainment and there's a Pixar film and something generic that I don't know if it's good or not, I'm going with Pixar.  Clearly they have expertise to sell.  There's also music I'll buy (or at least consider) just because of the label.<p>The challenge for Time or any other entertainment-content providers is cultivating the appropriate quality and expertise, fitting it into an appropriate business model, and cutting away the cruft.  This might mean downsizing like crazy and outsourcing, or it might not.  Some companies will find a new model that works and survive, while others will struggle and eventually fail.  IMO, one big problem for the MPAA and RIAA is that they've made some actively-bad choices in that transition, inconveniencing and alienating consumers while not really protecting what they're trying to protect.",1271467814

1272382,comment,1271662,1272222,0,0,strlen,,,"First, this is an excellent comment and should have a much higher score than my fanboyish original :-)<p>I agree that Scala is restricted by the JVM (and the aim of full compatibility with Java) and as a result type inference, pattern matching and more suffer heavily. F#, OCaml and Haskell are better examples of modern type systems as they're less encumbered. I am fairly curious about how F# works around the CLR (or rather, how much CLR accommodates type systems different from C#'s), guess it's up to me to RTFM.<p><i>> It's as if people are so tired of Java that they are looking for a way out, willing to compromise just for some syntactic sugar.</i><p>I think this hits the nail on the head, but I don't see it as a bad thing. If there's a very strong reason to be on the JVM (e.g., other projects or libraries, operations preferences), it's nice to have an option that lets one have a more productive and enjoyable experience.<p>There are times where it feels like a big compiler hack (which it is), but first class functions (even if they're compiled down to anonymous classes), closures, optional lazy evaluation, type inference, limited pattern matching, case classes, traits/mixins, ""encouraged"" immutability, the collections, etc... add-up.<p>There are occasionally bugs and performance issues with compiler and the collections library, but overall I don't see what's compromised compared to programming in Java itself. I'd argue syntactic sugar classification applies more to Java 7's planned closures and first class methods.<p><i>> OOP was designed for dynamic type-systems</i><p>Yes, that's <i>literally</i> true. OOP feels natural in dynamically typed languages, even when it's bolted on (CLOS in Common Lisp, Perl 5).<p>It's still a mystery to me why Java ""won over"", given that Smalltalk had (at the time) better performing virtual machines (compared to older JVMs which were superceeded by HotSpot, which was originally used by Strongtalk) and great tooling. There are known examples of teams of inexperienced programmers working under guidance to produce large, well working projects in Smalltalk.<p><i>> That's why I hope people will invest in VMs that support dynamic languages in the future ... static typing is a bitch to get right, and it would be easier if the VM wouldn't impose a strict type-system on you.</i><p>Clojure, in my view, suffers the most from the type system that the JVM imposes. It would be interesting to see if Clojure and Scala would eventually target less restrictive VMs (reverting to compiler hacks on the JVM to functionally emulate these VMs).",1271466523

1272379,comment,1271888,1272028,0,0,dasil003,,,"I agree this is a definite weakness compared to svn, but the problem is that svn gains this facility by having no concept of a project.  Let me repeat that: in svn it is technically impossible to identify the project tree.<p>The problem with that, of course, is that merging only makes sense if you are merging branches that occur at the same tree-level in a project.  This is why subversion merge tracking is so buggy and half-baked... because any given directory could be a project tree, a subtree, a branch, or a tag, and you could merge any of them.  Sure if stick to certain conventions it works pretty well, but technically the whole implementation is a minefield, which is why svn will never be as robust as other systems that don't make this mistake.<p>Even though git's submodules and subtrees leave a lot to be desired, and have significant room for improvement, they will never be as convenient for partial checkouts, because the requirements for svn-style partial checkouts require crippling the entire system.",1271466510

It helps if you forget about ""files"" as something to ""move"".<p>I did it in the project I'm working on now! It originally had one main repository, and another for an extension that was used as a git submodule in the main one. Active development proceeded in both, with shitloads of commits in the main one just to update the reference to the submodule.<p>I decided this was retarded, so I took a clone of the extension repository, used <i>filter-branch</i> to rewrite it's entire history so that all the paths were always prefixed with ""vendor/extensions/project_name/"", and pushed it as an unrelated branch into the main repository.<p>Then in the main repository I made a new branch, removed the old submodule junk there, did a nice clean merge that melded all the commits from the extension branch going back in time, and made that the new master branch.",1271466055

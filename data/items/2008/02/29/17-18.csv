People very quickly forget the verbal deals made at hiring and by the time your early review roles around you might be working for someone else that wasn't involved in hiring you.<p>I think you're <i>much</i> better off just pushing for the salary you want in the beginning. You're in a more equal negotiating position at that point and it's when companies are used to haggling over salary. It'll be far easier for the hiring manager to argue ""We need to bump our offer up $10k to get this guy."" than ""It'd be nice if we gave Peter a $10k raise right now.""<p>This is due to the same forces that make it easier to quit and get a 50% salary increase at a new company than to get a 15% increase at your existing job.",1204307980

126206,story,,,30,23,wallflower,"Ask YC: How to start becoming an entrepreneur while still being an employee",,"This short piece from the NYTimes (below) piqued my interest. It offers some advice on how to act like an entrepreneur as an employee.<p>If you are not a burn-your-boat-on-the-shore type of person, how do you go about making the transition to full-time entrepreneur. Is it abrupt or gradual. I'm guessing gradual. As I make the transition, I'm working on building some web applications that I would find of use (language learning, memorization)<p>How many of you look at creating your own startup as a hobby, rather than a business, or as both?<p>What steps (most notably - to expand your comfort zone) do you recommend.? I've heard some crazy advice like lie down in a Starbucks for 10 seconds to desensitize yourself to what you think other people think. I'm thinking seriously of taking a break from my career to learn Spanish in a Latin American country.<p>[http://tinyurl.com/2k2jdf]\n""First, act more like an entrepreneur at your current job. Be a maverick. Put in longer hours, give yourself a crash course on your company’s operations and strategic goals and, most important, locate a problem outside your realm of expertise and solve it. “Your boss will notice,” Mr. Corbell said. If you lack sales experience, ask for a transfer to the marketing department.""",1204307676

126192,comment,126031,126179,0,0,fiaz,,,"Apologies, but this is the same as saying computer engineering will invade and take over web development.  The two are related in that the underpinnings of web development rely on the principles of computer engineering, but the usefulness of one application does not equate to encompassing the possibilities of the other.<p>While it is true that the mechanisms governing the interactions of neurons and the chemicals related to this interaction ultimately boil down to what we call ""physics"", it is useful to be able to think at higher levels of abstraction.<p>Such intellectual groupings/classifications/segments are important to advancing knowledge.  I am open to considering that currently the ""mental toolation"" of thinking at abstracted levels is reflective of the current level of human intellectual capacity.  Furthermore perhaps a blending of everything into one grand unified SCIENCE is maybe one day possible - but this does not equate to desirable; this is something for future generations to determine.  I believe/maintain there is a great deal of richness to be gained by having such abstracted levels at which we can think/operate.",1204305883

126186,comment,125766,125766,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I went through the same as you (except replace PHP with C#), so here's what I did.  It echoes a lot of the thoughts mentioned already:<p>To learn ""lispiness"", functional programming, and get a feel for the computational approach to programming, read The Little Schemer and The Seasoned Schemer.  Also watch the SICP lectures (<a href=""http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-le...</a>) and if you're ambitions, read the book (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a>).  Doing these things will help keep you from writing PHP in Lisp.<p>To put it into practical perspective and learn the nuts and bolts of modern common Lisp, read Practical Common Lisp (<a href=""http://www.gigagmonkeys.com/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigagmonkeys.com/book</a>).<p>If you read PCL, you will run into Emacs and SLIME (the generally preferred [NO FLAMES, PLEASE.  I KNOW VI IS AWESOME TOO] open source way to edit Lisp files).  I wrote some resources to help with that:<p><a href=""http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/articles/public-beta-open-for-ultimate-n00b-slimeemacs-cheat-sheet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/articles/public-beta-open-f...</a><p><a href=""http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/articles/reference-for-the-slimelispemacs-screencast/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/articles/reference-for-the-...</a><p>I'm surprised no one has mentioned PAIP (Peter Norvig's Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming).  It's half AI book, half tutorial on Lisp programming and Lisp style.  It's a good read with lots of example programs written in good Lisp Style.<p>There are three hurdles people usually run into when learning Lisp:<p>a) the language looks different - this goes away with practice and familiarity.  It starts looking normal fast.  The parentheses are a bit tough to manage unless you use a capable editor, which leads to:<p>b) Emacs is different - really powerful, fun to use, but it takes investment in learning.  It's really tempting to quit when starting, but worth getting over the hump.  Once you do that:<p>c) the way of thinking is different in Lisp - Lisp seems a little awkward to use until you get (don't need to master them, just get the idea) the following ideas: 1) code can be manipulated as data because the syntax is so simple, 2) creating your own syntax (using macros - code that writes code) means that you can express your program in a way that closely matches the problem you're trying to solve.  Some good articles to help get these points are:<p><a href=""http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html</a><p>Don't worry if you don't get these ""big picture"" things at first, they click at some point and everything makes a lot more sense.  You can speed that up by putting a lot more Lisp in your head in the meantime.<p>Good luck!",1204305738

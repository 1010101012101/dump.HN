The term <i>type</i> comes from <i>type theory</i> which is an entire discipline (as far as computer languages are concerned) based on the idea of propositions as types. If types are propositions, then what are programs themselves? Proofs of those propositions, of course, with the type-checker doing the work of checking the proofs. With so-called <i>dynamically typed</i> languages you do not have that. What you do have is dynamic dispatch based on the class of a value. This has nothing to do with types!",1389668338

The PHP internals group struggles still occur to this day as new ideas and fresh thinking run up against the old guard and more often than not are discarded.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the &quot;old guard&quot; - they&#x27;ve been around a long time and they&#x27;ve seen a lot of failed ideas - and it&#x27;s been them who dealt with the cleanup and had to maintain those broken features long past the founders of those features had moved on.<p>This isn&#x27;t a bad thing: PHP is rooted in many businesses both small and enterprise: it will be around for a long time. Projects like HHVM are going to ensure that.<p>However, I no longer think that PHP is going to &quot;turn it around&quot; and will ever be a model of innovation.

AMA exists as a concept because of Reddit and its community, whereas Storify helped shape the concept of Twitter narratives (or maybe contexts is the word I&#x27;m looking for). For an AMA if you get heavy hitters, like Barack Obama or Bill Gates, they are going to go to Reddit because that&#x27;s where the community is, which is precisely the type of AMAer you would need to make an &quot;AMA startup&quot; a viable business.

The thing is that once every household has a smart Internet connected gadget with eyes and ears and a way to load software onto it remotely, it is just too big a target for someone like the NSA not to go after. Why not load spy software on these just in case? Oh and it can all be legal and it can be made illegal for Google or Nest or whoever to talk about it.<p>The analogy here is something like the OnStar system in recent cars. I don&#x27;t think that many people who made it happen primarily did so to give the banks a way to find and repo cars, but once a large percentage of cars have this system it does enable banks to do it much more efficiently.

Many of his adventures in self-experimentation were dangerous; almost all of them were pretty disgusting. At various times, he medicated himself with botanical purgatives, botanical emetics, mercury, steel filings, tobacco, absinthe, and mineral water so foul that he found ammonium chloride preferable to it. Hooke obsessed over getting a good night&#x27;s sleep and clearing out his lethargic digestive system. He often found his home remedies violently effective. He authored a recipe for turning pee into phosphorus salts, including an intermediate step of letting the effluvia sit &quot;till it putrify and breed Worms.&quot;</i>",1389665266

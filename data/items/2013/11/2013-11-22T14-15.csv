The company still acknowledges the knowledge and value locked up in the engineer, and if he did his job, but the project manager / whomever made the wrong choices, the engineer is pretty safe.<p>If the <i>project</i> fails, well, seeing to it that the project doesn&#x27;t fail is the manager&#x27;s job, so yeah, if the <i>project</i> fails, the manager is more likely to get fired than an Engineer, especially if other managers think that the project failed due to poor management.<p>However, if the <i>engineer</i> fails, it is the manager&#x27;s job to fire the Engineer in question, before the Engineer&#x27;s failure turns into a project failure.<p>So either way, yeah, if you are perceived to have failed at your job, you are likely to get fired.   The manager has a different job than the engineer, and thus is likely to get fired in different situations.<p>But I don&#x27;t think that managers have less job security than Engineers.     In fact, I think Managers face rather less systemic risk in terms of technology changes than Engineers do.   For instance, when UNIX beat mainframes?   There were a lot of SysAdmins who had to scramble for serious retraining or to make the jump to management.",1385132331

That&#x27;s right, the game devs ate the cost of promoting FB credits.  Plus, you had no idea if you were accepting promotional FB credits or real ones, or if certain big companies got a sweeter deal on getting a higher real/promotional balance, AND you didn&#x27;t know how many of your credits were real or promotional until the balance report came in, making it kind of difficult to identify just how much money you&#x27;d actually earned.<p>Now maybe Amazon will eat their promotional costs themselves here, but to any dev considering implementing this, be wary, and read everything.  I know that&#x27;s standard advice, obviously, but it should be especially so with your cashflow, and I&#x27;m <i>personally</i> wary as fuck about this, given just how similar to FB credits it appears.",1385132272

I don&#x27;t know that manufacturers think there&#x27;s much of a market there, however.<p>> Which has made me wonder if this switch to LED is way more complex than just those two measurements :P<p>It is. There are a bajillion things going on. One which you&#x27;ve already noticed is how dimming impacts color temperature. CRI is also a huge issue. Then there&#x27;s the optics - LEDs are very directional, so they require pretty advanced lenses in order to achieve a desired lighting pattern [1]. Optics impact all kinds of things, including color temperature, and since the development cost is high you can expect cheap brands to skimp there. If you&#x27;re comparing them by looking directly at the bulb, internal glare/reflection is hard to match as well.<p>I&#x27;d still caution against using the A19s in a recessed fixture. It&#x27;s not a safety issue (that I&#x27;m aware of), but you definitely won&#x27;t get the rated life out of the bulb.<p>Out of curiosity, did you try an LED BR30? I think you might find one from a quality manufacturer to be a bit better than the A19.<p>1: $20 says the lighting pattern on the Sylvania LED is smoother/more regular than the Sylvania halogen, but I&#x27;m biased since I know the guy who designed the lens.",1385131763

For a 60W light bulb, about 1.25W is converted into light and 58.75W into heat [1]. It&#x27;s incredibly inefficient, and the filament can reach temperatures of over 3000K. (Ever wonder why CCFL lamps have their colors expressed as temperatures like 2900K? That&#x27;s the actual temperature of a filament with the same color.)<p>A 60W-equivalent LED lamp uses 6-8W of energy. Assuming it converts roughly the same amount of energy (1.25W) into light, the remaining 4.75-6.75W needs to be converted to heat. That&#x27;s about as much thermal dissipation as a low-end laptop CPU, but concentrated in a much smaller area and with a much less effective cooling system (it doesn&#x27;t even have a fan). 85 degrees sounds about right.<p>[Edit] Still, 85 degrees is nothing compared to the extreme temperatures that a filament in a regular light bulb experiences. It&#x27;s only a problem because the LED chips aren&#x27;t made of carbon or tungsten like filaments are.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb#Efficacy.2C_efficiency.2C_and_environmental_impact"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb#Effica...</a>",1385131337

6780930,comment,6778754,6779691,3,0,pron,,,"Let me first say the I applaud Rust and the effort you&#x27;re making in developing a new, safe systems-programming language. But I do have one concern.<p>I like this quote by an Intel engineer, which appears on the back of <i>Java Concurrency in Practice</i>: &quot;For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore&#x27;s Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl&#x27;s Law.&quot;<p>I think that this is the biggest challenge facing software development in this age. Now, I know concurrency is core to Rust, and I know that Rust adopts message passing as the principal concurrency construct. Message passing is terrific, extremely useful, and as close as we&#x27;ve got to a model of programming multi-core that&#x27;s simple and easy to grasp. But at the end of the day, we do need a way to develop efficient mutable, concurrent data structures. Languages that rely on message passing, like Erlang, usually pass this problem down to a database, but the problem still has to be solved.<p>You say that languages resorting to GC &quot;sacrifice performance and control over the machine&quot;. But GC already provides better throughput than manual memory allocation in practically all circumstances, and suffers mostly from latency issues (pauses), but even those are being worked on with some good progress (like the work done by Azul on their JVM). The only major true sacrifice GC requires is extra RAM, which is becoming ever cheaper.<p>GC is currently the best way to develop efficient concurrent (shared) data structures. There are ways of writing those without a general-purpose GC (RCU and hazard pointers), but those wither require kernel cooperation, and/or suffer from worse worst-case performance, and/or quickly transform into GC when generalized.<p>I know the plan is for Rust to have a GC as part of the libraries, but this problem (of developing efficient concurrent data structures) must be addressed. It&#x27;s possible that hardware has become too complicated for us <i>not</i> to give up some control over to some runtime. Maybe we&#x27;re at a stage where low-level full-control programming is incompatible with fully utilizing the hardware for best performance. It is possible that low-level systems programming languages will excel in resource constrained environments and have several other advantages, but sheer performance/scalability won&#x27;t be one of them (at least on server-class hardware).",1385131233

But what I&#x27;m about to point out is true in much of Europe.<p>Much of the culture clash you&#x27;re seeing between comments from Europeans and Americans in this thread comes down to the difference in how the funding for public institutions is managed when it comes to copyrighted works.<p>In the US it&#x27;s federal law that any work the government produces be placed in the public domain, no questions asked. So e.g. when the USGS produces a map it&#x27;s fully funded by the government and placed in the public domain.<p>In Europe it&#x27;s common for public (and pseudo-public, like the DIN) institutions to have a hybrid funding model, they&#x27;re partially funded by taxpayers, but are expected to collect a nominal fee from the public or industry that expects to directly use some of their work.<p>Both models have their advantaged and disadvantages. One obvious one over in Europe is that if you partially depend on direct public funding you&#x27;re more likely to actively serve the public, whereas in the US institutions would me more likely to gravitate towards serving the government itself, since it&#x27;s only the government they depend on for funding.<p>Another aspect is that hypothetically it costs around the same thing to produce a map in Europe and America, but in Europe the general population will be taxed less for it, but people who directly use it (and buy it) will disproportionally pay for it.<p>Much of this is changing over in Europe, e.g. the National Land Survey of Iceland now gives out its map data under a free license, because indirect value to society of having freely available maps was judged greater than the sum of the nominal fee they previously charged for a license to use those maps.<p>This gets especially hairy in cases like these where some of this data being charged for is referenced directly or indirectly by law.<p>In the Reykjavík area in Iceland you can&#x27;t do significant construction work without spending a relatively trivial sum to buy a ridiculously accurate map from the city (I think it&#x27;s accurate down to 1-2 millimeters) showing where all the pipes and electrical cabling is installed. The surveying effort is mostly funded by private construction companies.<p>Would it be better if the average citizen just paid more in taxes and that map was made freely available, is some private citizen who isn&#x27;t going to build a whole road but just do some significant yard work being overcharged because he has to legally comply with proprietary information?<p>I don&#x27;t know, but the trade-offs involved aren&#x27;t very clear in my mind.",1385130858

Your model for programming appears to be 10,000 monkeys typing away at the specifications handed down from On High.  PHP does work in that scenario.  It's simple.  It's easy to think in because it's so simple.  You can do complex things, but it'll be by gluing infinitesimally simple parts together over and over and over again.  (Think of PHP programs as an essay written by a 2nd grader.  Lots of simple sentences.  Lots of repetition.)<p>If all you have available is a bulk of mediocre people, then PHP is a great way of making sure they produce what you want <i>right now</i>.  Of corse, in this process, they will remain mediocre and never become more than your ""average programmer"" stereotype due to being forced to only think in the absolute simplest terms.",1265143850

But seriously, the C++ implementation comes at the cost of many of PHP's features; a ""more complex solution"" would allow those features to be kept.  And while C++ is fast, a script translated into C++ is not going to be as fast as if you had written the application directly in C++, unless the compiler is very, very smart.  (I have not seen any implementation that does this; GHC's native code generator produces faster code than it's ""via-C"" code generator, for example.)<p>Also, static compilation precludes runtime-based optimization techniques, which has made a lot of code run ""faster than C"" (including C, ironically; see LLVM).<p>So anyway, all this is is a way to compile a limited subset of PHP to C++.  In doing so, you have to write a special dialect of PHP, without PHP's easy deployability and code/test/debug cycle.<p>In that case, why are you using PHP to begin with, when a language like GHC or SBCL would run faster and without any compromises?",1265143817

The two issues are (a) how much of Ruby the language can be compiled to C++ using Type Inference, and (b) For the stuff that can't be compiled, how often does it show up in production code?<p>FB's PHP solution relies on having a large code base with few instances of code that doesn't compile cleanly.<p>With Ruby, I suspect both issues are a problem. I  think there's a lot more of Ruby the language that will be difficult to infer, and furthermore I think Ruby programmers tend to use those features a lot.<p>That's just a guess, mind you. You could probably do a lot if you make some major breaks with tradition. For example, if instead of compiling Ruby source code you load Ruby classes, run all the meta-programming, then reverse-engineer the source (ParseTree can do this with Ruby 1.8 but not Ruby 1.9), you could basically do the meta-programming in interpreted mode but run the resulting code in compiled mode.<p>I suspect that would work well for a lot of Rails programs where the hairiest stuff is run when classes are loaded, not on the fly when responses are being served.",1265142991

While she does not mention it, this idea seems to be particularly applicable to vitamin C. It is certainly an important part of general health. However, if I understand the research correctly, beyond the small amount necessary to prevent scurvy, studies have shown no benefits at all to taking vitamin C supplements (corrections are welcome!).<p>So: the first few paragraphs suggest that, while high vitamin D levels seem to correlate with good health, that does not mean that supplements help. Correlation does not equal causation, etc.<p>That is all fine. However, she then goes on to cite studies, <i>all</i> of which were concerned not with vitamin D levels in the body, but with supplementation.<p>Furthermore, she rather strangely says that the Women's Health Initiative study ""found no overall benefit"", and yet also found that vitamin D + calcium supplementation correlated with reduced incidence of hip fracture.

If something comes along later that's head and shoulders above dvcs, then I'll be happy to switch. But for now, random folks' views on why their tool is marginally technically better doesn't outweigh the enormous benefits of everyone you know using the same dvcs.<p>And it annoys me when people use BitBucket over Github. It's like your one friend who insists on not having a Facebook account and sticking to his Livejournal because Livejournal is supposedly better at some random thing, but in reality, you strongly suspect he just wants to prove he's not a follower, an independent breed cut from a better cloth than the rest of us.<p>These days, whenever I need a new little tool, its official repo is usually on Github. This lets me pull it into my project as a submodule and still contribute back in a very efficient way. As soon as it's mercurial, I can't, simply because I don't know mercurial and I certainly have zero intention of attaining the same mastery of it that I have of git. And, frankly, I don't want to attain any mastery of it.<p>Moreover, of course, you can't just mix repos willy nilly. Maybe there's a way to use mercurial as a submodule of git repos. But it's gonna be a dastardly hack.<p>So, please. Just use git. Competition is good, but so is standardization. I get that you have highly nuanced opinions about the various merits of dvcs, and I'm sure you're right and I'm wrong.

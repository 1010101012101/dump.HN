He writes repeatedly about the futility of worrying about one&#x27;s place in history, because of the inevitability not only of one&#x27;s own death but of the deaths of everyone who could have possibly cared about or remembered one&#x27;s accomplishments anyway.

Elon has said that the fuel is a very small cost compared to the entire launch, so I would assume the cost to refly a &quot;used&quot; rocket is going to be orders of magnitude cheaper than the original flight.<p>Engineers have been scratching their heads for decades trying to figure out where all the money goes.  For shuttle launches, depending on who&#x27;s doing the accounting, fuel was something on the order of 2% of total launch costs.  And the shuttle was reusable as well.<p>I think it&#x27;s that disparity that attracted Musk to the rocket business in the first place.  You look at the cost breakdowns and think &quot;What?  How can this be so expensive?&quot;  If everything goes his way he&#x27;ll have cut the vehicle cost by a factor of at least 20 by the time he&#x27;s done.",1426833635

It&#x27;s like the mechanical engineers of 1880s who had the idea of the impossibility of flight so entrenched in their minds that not only they kept claiming that it&#x27;s impossible, they were quite proactive in dismissing the efforts of those trying to do something about it. (I always like to use this link: <a href=""http://www.spacequotations.com/predictions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacequotations.com/predictions.html</a>).<p>If people had attempted flight in 1690s, it would not have gotten us anywhere. The science and engineering wasn&#x27;t developed enough. But at some point, someone had to realize that &quot;yes, now we have enough knowledge, resources and tools, to give it a last push&quot;. And that was what flight pioneers realized in 1890s, and 1900s.<p>For aging, are we in the 1690s, or 1890s of flight?<p>If it comes down to medical community agreeing to seek an answer to that, consider that a solved problem for someone like me.<p>The problem is, most medical researchers simply dismiss the idea as over-ambitious, resort to ad-hominems, socioeconomic criticisms, and (surprise, surprise) the pro-aging trance, instead of technical critique. So the honest discussion about the technology gets lost in all that noise.",1426833296
9236459,comment,9232468,9235599,0,0,cfallin,,,"> Immutability is nothing like explicit version control. So far as I know no language has anything close to explicit version control for state.<p>Well, it depends on which version control system we&#x27;re imagining. In my mind, the immutable data-structure approach is like git, and I <i>think</i> what you&#x27;re imagining is more like CVS.<p>Consider: immutability by itself doesn&#x27;t enforce versioning; it just makes the state-of-the-world equivalent to state-of-the-root-pointers-of-your-heap, because the pointed-to things cannot change. (I.e., referential transparency.) So it pushes the versioning up to whatever agents manage the root pointers. This is sort of like git: you build an immutable DAG, and you have mutable HEAD pointers that move around in it. (The difference is that git has one HEAD for the tree while this world has one HEAD per global or stack-local root.) When you have a reference, you have a snapshot of the world in time that will never change.<p>Your &quot;each slot has a list of previous states&quot; is more like CVS in that it versions each &quot;file&quot; separately. This is also useful, but for a different reason: sometimes you really do want that history as a first-class concept. You can derive the per-file history in a git-like system too but it involves some computation. (And coming back from the analogy, in such a memory-management scheme, you would need to formalize the changes to root pointers into some sort of transaction system.)<p>All of that said, I think what you describe would be really useful for debugging, albeit probably pretty expensive (each store instruction touches an undo log?). Time-reversible debuggers may have done something like this?",1426833293

It&#x27;s not people outside the Rails world picking up Ruby.<p>Chef, in my experience, is favored almost exclusively by people who are already Rubyists. The concept of applying The Power Of Ruby (TM) to system configuration is not attractive to non-Rubyists.<p>I don&#x27;t see Vagrant much these days. I suspect Docker is displacing it.",1426831802

In fact, it&#x27;ll probably happen at some point.  I did indicate that you should have tests in place to catch regressions like this.

The King would grant a patent to whatever foreign engineer was willing to immigrate with a particular invention or industrial technique that another state was keeping secret (printing presses and coal refining both crossed the English Channel that way). The same language of &quot;patent&quot; was used for early colonial charters, too, because it was the same process: somebody willing to take something from somebody else is granted (some) legal protection by the state that benefits from that taking.<p>Patents were developed as a way to aid piracy, not a way to prevent it.",1426831505

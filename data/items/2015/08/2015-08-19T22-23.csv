  * Watching for new keyboard shortcuts
  * Seeing workflows similar to mine in different IDEs and languages

The challenge is that the most significant N-grams (e.g. N > 2) have such low frequency that there isn&#x27;t much data to train on. Our current approach is to try to coax patterns out of the N-grams (e.g. &quot;salesman was rude&quot; and &quot;manager was mean&quot; become &quot;[employee]=[negative]&quot;).

Elsewhere in this thread, I cited an instance of Apple taking three years to fix a vulnerability responsibly disclosed.  Would you say it was better to let that vulnerability sit for three years than to disclose it immediately so that it would get fixed within a few months?  Obviously none of this proves we should jump to instant full disclosure, I just mean the existing approaches all have issues, so there is room for personal opinion and judgment.  I don&#x27;t even feel strongly about second-guessing this particular instance, because I&#x27;m betting the discloser knows more than we do.

You could only have 256 distinct glyphs on the screen at a time, and maybe you couldn&#x27;t even reprogram them, but you could do quite a bit of useful graphics inside those constraints.  Text especially, obviously.  And you could do it with a lot less memory.<p>Nonprogrammable fonts were mostly just idiocy, because a quad-input NAND gate would have been sufficient to distinguish a 16-glyph RAM area from the ROM, and 128 bytes of RAM would have been sufficient for 16 8×8 glyphs; also, 5×8 glyphs were actually pretty common at the time.

It seems we are making a habit of disagreeing with each other. ;-)<p>Though I do entirely agree with the first sentence of your comment. It&#x27;s the same reason why piracy isn&#x27;t the dire issue the various media industries make it out to be. The <i>vast</i> majority of people who pirate content, were never going to pay for that content to begin with. So they&#x27;re not actually losing those sales, because there was never a potential for a sale. I make no claims about this being moral behavior or otherwise, I&#x27;m just acknowledging that this is reality.<p>For the rest of your comment, however, I don&#x27;t think the driveway analogy holds up. It may be your browser, but it is their content being served via their infrastructure. It costs them real money to create and host this content. Ignoring for a moment that some ads are obnoxious, do you genuinely believe that content creators should <i>lose</i> money for the &quot;privilege&quot; of having you consume their content? Because that seems rather silly to me.<p>The simple fact is that when you use an ad blocker, you are not just preventing a website from making money off obnoxious ads. You are actually costing the content creator money. Out of their own pocket. The same content creator whom you probably believe deserves money for providing you with that information or entertainment. How can you possibly reconcile these conflicting facts?<p>Pretending to be making a statement by boycotting all advertisement in an attempt to force the ad industry to change its ways, is no different from the extreme minority of pirates who insist that they are morally justified to never pay for <i>anything</i>, just because they don&#x27;t like how the music industry operates. Regardless of whether any given industry conducts their business ethically, having a differing moral opinion does not automatically entitle you to everything for free. Or in the cast of ad blockers, entitling you to content at the <i>quantifiable expense</i> of its creator.",1440022491

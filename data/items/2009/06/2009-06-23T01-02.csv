669711,comment,668030,668753,0,0,gnaritas,,,"> 1. Access to prescription drugs which are not safe.<p>Why?  Seriously, all drugs should be OTC because it simply shouldn't be the governments job to protect me from myself.  The government should have no say about what I choose or choose not to put in my own body.  I can go to the store and pick up enough alcohol to drink myself to death in a matter of hours and that's OK, but pills require special treatment and protection?  Bullshit.<p>Drugs should be clearly labeled with warnings, side effects, all pertinent information a person needs to make a decision.  The only exceptions would be things like antibiotics because there's a valid reason to restrict their use and it benefits everyone to do so.<p>Doctors can still tell me what drug I should take, and in what dose, but they shouldn't be at all involved in my obtaining those drugs.  If I go buy a bunch of morphine and overdose and kill myself, well... that's called natural selection, and it's a good thing.  If you're really concerned about making sure people are informed, mandate that the pharmacist brief people of the issues.<p>The very notion of prescription drugs is just absurd really, we've just gotten so accustomed to the nanny state that we don't notice just how absurd it is.  Many family doctors are little more than state approved drug dealers these days.  Patients know what they want, they know what to say to get them, and doctors are more than happy to write them, so long as their pockets are lined with regular and mostly unnecessary checkups to do nothing more than refill a prescription.<p>Yes, many drugs are very dangerous and an overdose could easily kill you, guess what, so will an overdose of gasoline.  So will an overdose of water, or diet pills, or hundreds of other OTC stuff.  Things shouldn't be illegal because they're dangerous if you misuse them, that's not freedom.<p>> 2. Access to specialized equipment.
> 3. Access to highly skilled people to do something you can't do safely.<p>Which are valid reasons to actually go see a doctor.  I can't cat scan myself or operate on myself.",1245721618

669693,comment,668460,669080,0,0,gojomo,,,"Your logic makes sense, but was there an opening for more negotiation at that point, as in: ""I understand there's no speaker budget, and I won't charge for a cozy mutually-beneficial conversation, but the giant audience and video cost exactly $X?"" (A formal price sheet could help them conclude ""it costs what it costs"" rather than ""he's angling for more"".)<p>Alternatively, though it is also distasteful from a ""give away and trust"" perspective, you could overfill the talk with teasers and upsells -- that is, to speak to a larger audience uncompensated, it will necessarily be more a sales pitch than open conversation. (""I can answer <i>that</i> question on a 2-day consulting contract."" ""I cover that in my low-priced video series."")<p>Or, the condition for them videotaping could be you get a copy, they can't offer it on the open net, and you have the right to use/sell the video elsewhere. (This might get gummed up in their legal process and thus be a de facto 'no deal', but it's another way to propose splitting up the gains from your talk.)<p>So while there's always a point you may have to withhold your full output, there could also be other zones of agreement.

669686,comment,668356,668356,0,0,PhillipJFry,,,"I generally agree with the sentiments expressed here, but might I play devil's advocate for a second and explore the other side?<p>We are a self-selecting group of programmers who put a high degree of emphasis on bettering our skills and learning, and innovating. I would imagine that we all subscribe to the notion that a good developer can provide a value multiples higher than that of the typical ""code monkey."" I don't know if we'd all agree on the specific factor, but it's clearly greater than two.<p>I got lucky and managed to find a very competent mentor. It's turned my world upside down, but I've managed to see the light. That's why I'm in this community. I work for a startup, etc.<p>But how do you create value? What matters? This CEO clearly thinks that the way to create value is to hamper the free-flowing development processes that can truly yield great results given a good team. Instead of that he emphasizes top-down highly controlled development. To him developers are cogs in a machine.<p>But honestly, if you have a product that isn't meant to be revolutionary, and you work in a well-defined field, then maybe this isn't such a terrible approach? Hypothetically speaking, with a few people on the top who know what needs to be done, and a very rigid lower structure, then it could clearly work. And by ""work"" I mean create revenue and satisfy customers.<p>Now think back to your CS education (if you had one). In the US, a CS education attracts a lot of folks who aren't interested in the inventive, exploratory, creative method of programming. They learn Java (and only Java) because that's what's popular. They don't spend much time thinking about bettering their skills and the do what they are told. This is probably the vast majority of programmers, I would imagine.<p>Now a lot of you guys out there probably attended more of the elite universities where you are exposed to this competitive / creative atmosphere. Or maybe you got that elsewhere, it doesn't really matter. But if you went to a lesser school, you'd see that the majority of the CS grads really aren't that different than code monkeys. They hate the theory classes because they don't expect to use it. And if they don't see the point in theory, then they won't use it. There are a few that will ""get it"" and they will excel in what they do. Because they are passionate.<p>So why would you hire an American code monkey who costs five times as much as an Indian? I can't see the value either.<p>This, by the way, is one of the reasons why I feel that we also see so many stories of unemployable software engineers in the US. Knowing Java inside and out is a valuable skill, no doubt, but it isn't something all that creative.<p>Now, back to reality here. The guy's main complaint is that Americans expect to get rich. Now at this point, I can't say that I agree. I don't know if your typical American ""code monkey"" is after that result. But I think that those of us who love what we do can justify higher pay, because we are more likely to generate much more revenue per body than the average code monkey. It's just that his management structure has no way to take advantage of greater talent.<p>But that can be difficult.",1245719567

They'd have to build a sales and delivery channel, create a supply chain that could sustain the volumes required to run a lower-margin business, and, after all that, be competing in a segment that services value-conscious buyers, many of whom are already confused about the difference between hybrid and PEV.<p>That's iff you're right. But you probably aren't. Because you're swagging materials costs out of thin air when talking about a product that went from $140k in materials alone to $80k in a span of months. That was apparently a harrowing crisis for a product with a six-figure sticker. For a car that would go up against a BMW 3-Series, they'd have no such margin of error.<p>In the end, you have to ask yourself what the world should be getting from Tesla. If it's technology, then who cares who they sell it to first? Why would you ask them to pursue a business model that increases the chances that they'll go out of business before they ship rev2, rev3, and rev4? Why does the final product even need Tesla's badge on it? Maybe, like many other luxury manufacturers, Tesla's badge will always be prohibitively expensive, but their components will OEM to much more cost-effective platforms from Daimler.",1245718806

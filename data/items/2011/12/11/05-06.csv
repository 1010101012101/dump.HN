3339385,comment,3339193,3339193,20,0,nostrademons,,,"Friendship's always struck me as closely tied in with serendipity.<p>When I was in college, I had a wide circle of online friends in the Harry Potter fandom.  I figured I'd never meet most of them, many of them were just bored high-schoolers, and a few had pretty serious mental problems.  My parents were like ""Why do you spend so much time talking to these people?""  Hell, when I've mentioned the Harry Potter fandom as a significant life event in a past comment here, tptacek was like ""Fanfiction?  Seriously?""<p>But over the years since then, that group of friends gave me tons of emotional support through my first forays into dating and my academic difficulties in college.  They gave me the advice that eventually convinced me to stay in school.  Advice on, and a ready-made friends-group for, my semester abroad in New Zealand.  My first software project, carried through from conception to completion.  The nucleus of my social contacts while I was heads-down working on my startup after college.  My job at Google.  My first kiss, repeat date, and make-out session.<p>You can't always predict what good things will result from a relationship with someone.  One of the things that I hated about the startup scene was that everyone <i>wants</i> something - they'll take you out for coffee to pitch their new startup that needs a technical cofounder, but as soon as you make it clear that you're not ready to do that at this time, you never hear from them again.  I never expected that I would get a job at Google from someone in the Harry Potter fandom - after all, she wasn't even a CS major, I'd met her in person all of once, and our conversations consisted mostly of squeeing over Harry/Luna and nothing technical.  But when I started looking for jobs and asked who was hiring, she was like ""I know this guy, I can vouch for him"", and I'd say it's worked out pretty well for everyone involved.",1323582376
3339384,comment,3339193,3339295,9,0,grovulent,,,"I dont feel you deserve to be voted down on this comment...<p>I actually think your statement - while ultimately needing more argument behind it - is actually true of just about all of the analysis I read these days.  It's all thoroughly atavistic - without a particularly well explained explanation as to what exactly is the value of the thing being lost.<p>This article is actually better than most... but it's not great.  It intimates that the strength of friendship comes from the intimacy that allows for critique as well as support.<p>But then the author goes on to focus on the elements of social networking which are actually entirely compatible with the account of friendship that he praises - namely the drop in signalling costs associated with online social networking.<p>Backward looking authors such as these are usually confused in this way - they fret over the seeming 'cheapness' of online social networking - but confuse this with the corresponding superficiality of those relationships.<p>To dispel this confusion I like to use the following analogy.  Back when were apes - we used to signal allegiance by grooming - an expensive and time consuming activity.  Now imagine that we developed language within the space of generation (not true - but bear with me) - imagine what the grand parents would have thought of their grandchildren signalling to each other cheaply to one another using language.  they would have thought it cheap - and insincere.<p>But of course - the use of language in and of itself is not constitutive of a shallow relationship.  What they would be reacting to is a sudden drop in the cost of signalling - and would mistrust it because of the costs that they were used to.<p>The upshot is that there is nothing essential in the nature of social networking that leads to a lack of intimacy.  You can't blame the tech here.<p>Having said that - there is a danger posed to intimacy by some of the uses being made of the tech.  But it will come from the ability to trade out your established intimacy for economic reward.",1323582347

Don't send out blanket resumes to anyone who is hiring with the hope that something will stick.  Don't waste time with recruiters who have no idea about the tech industry and/or work out of some call center in New Jersey.  Spend time searching for jobs that appeal to you, particularly stuff from personal contacts, HN or StackOverflow careers before wading into Monster or Dice.  Also, spend the time to check out any companies in your area(s) that you are interested in.  Many times companies only post jobs on their own site, and sometimes jobs aren't posted at all.  If you know of a company you want to work for, send in a resume even if they don't have open positions.  Then, put as much effort as possible into nailing one or two job possibilities a week.  That means researching the company and their competition (Twitter/Glassdoor/LinkedIn/etc), refreshing yourself on any software topics related to their niche, and playing with any of their products you can get your hands on.

But if you are just relaxing with nothing to do or feel like reading something a little different maybe you will learn something new about one of your friends.<p>In the same way that facebook let people 'send emails' that didn't have to be read, these sidebar updates allow you to 'post statuses' that don't have to be looked at.

Plenty of people would buy it, and try to compete based on marketing.  Many people who go into business view the world as nothing more than:<p><pre><code>  mediocre product -> loudmouth marketing -> profit\n</code></pre>\nYou can also then charge maintenance fees and feature requests.  This would be better than charging for ideas because words are abstract. You tell a great idea to someone, they design the product/service in their heads, and then tell you all the ways it won't work. This happened to Google, VLSI circuits, HP and the Alan Kay's recommendation for the netbook in 2004, etc.<p>Creating a v1.0 or working prototype lowers the chance people will misinterpret/mis-design the idea in their greedy brains.  The people dumb enough to pay for ideas are the type of people who avoid anything technical.

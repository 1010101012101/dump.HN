Anyone with an antenna farm like Aereo will be able to capture, store and redistribute those feeds -- and why not modify them to skip commercials too? Anyone with a device containing 300M antennas can claim to be able to intermediate service for all Americans.<p>This is not, in and of itself, a reason why Aereo is wrong in this case. Plus, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that free OTA&#x27;s days are numbered anyway. But Aereo would, I think, be attempting here to kill its host.",1392879595

I thought your point was that I was praying on the desperate and taking advantage of people who didn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re worth? I&#x27;m glad you changed your tune.<p>By the way I know plenty of people at startups who tell me they can&#x27;t find decent engineers when they&#x27;re offering 30-50% more in salary than I do. And 99% of these startups are NOT building database engines or running massive social networks. Most of them actually have web apps that are on par with the web apps we build for our clients if they are even that sophisticated.<p>The problem as I see it is that a lot of the management at these startups are deluded about the skill set they need and they lack the intellectual honesty to admit that their startup is not Google (yet). They can&#x27;t find candidates because they are so in love with the idea of talent, too picky and don&#x27;t want to invest in employee development. I mean it&#x27;s not the end of the world if a candidate doesn&#x27;t have experience with Git or unit testing. This stuff isn&#x27;t that hard to learn and if your employees have nothing to learn from you they will probably be bored very quickly.<p>On the flip side all these ads for 6 figure positions and talk about salaries and talent shortages has given a lot of below average, average and good but not great engineers (which make up 99% of the labor pool by the way) the mistaken impression that anybody with a few years experience who can build a crud rails app can make a couple of phone calls and land in a 120k a year job. It&#x27;s nothing but a mirage. For every 1 engineer who can get one of the $$$ jobs there are 50 who could do a dozen interviews and get no offers.",1392879158

Phased array radars use many more elements, much higher control over the wavefront, and for a different purpose.<p>In a cellular antenna scenario, unlike phased array radar, you cannot avoid multiple lobes, but the advantage of phasing is still present. Adding antennas to the system (beyond three or four) becomes a case of diminishing returns.<p>> More antennas can enable you to narrow lobes more - you may have not been phasing them properly to get that effect.<p>There are paradoxical effects with more than a few antennas --  apart from the complexity issue. In some cases you will see lobes with strange shapes in locations having no benefit. With a circular array of antennas, you sometimes get concentric circles of high signal strength, not what you&#x27;re after in the described system.

Most books on programming usually contain a lot of basic knowledge about language constructs. It&#x27;s all variables, functions, classes, and then maybe some things about web programming. For the most part language constructs usually aren&#x27;t enough to solve problems. It&#x27;s very hard to take that knowledge and apply it to a fundamentally different problem than what was worked out in the book. And because the problems the book worked on were most likely trivial, you don&#x27;t really gain much perspective on how you would build something more complex.<p>That&#x27;s where computer science comes in. CS deals mostly with abstract concepts -- algorithms, data structures, parsing...that type of stuff. If you train your mind to think in these terms, then you start seeing programs as the sum of their parts (state machines, stacks, trees, grammars) and complex programs become less of a black-box. In effect you&#x27;re transforming And because you can now picture how someone else has built their program, you just put those same pieces together and with a bit of thinking and googling, you can glue them up into something similar. Eventually you&#x27;ll be able to picture your own solutions from scratch.<p>The thing, though, is that computer science is math. A different type of math, but math all the same. It&#x27;s something you have to work at your own pace, patiently. Deliberate practice is not just a catchy phrasing. It&#x27;s a very important concept. I stress this because I made the mistake of rushing through a lot of this stuff. I only half got it, but it&#x27;s worth taking the time to fully understand even seemingly simple concepts because it opens up so many possibilities!<p>So in order to solve your tutorial problem (&quot;what you need to learn, in what order, to get started&quot;), I would suggest you pick a problem that&#x27;s interesting to you, find out what sorts of concepts it depends on (what data structures are involved, what fundamental algorithms, ... that sort of thing) and work your way from those concepts to the solution (a working program). For example, if you were interested in building databases, you might want to learn more about b-trees, but in order to learn about b-trees you might need background in simpler data structures and work your way up. You might also want to learn about how to build a query engine, so you might want to learn more about lexing, parsing, and all that. From there you just learn how to implement those things (or find a decent library) in your language of choice and go from there.",1392877748

Artificial manned flight was speculated as a possibility for centuries with no macroscopic working examples, and heavily criticized as a transportational panacea/fantasy that was seen as clearly impossible to people at the time.<p>In fact, the analogy extends startlingly far. People doubted the possibility of manned flying machines for the longest time, with arguments strikingly similar to yours, e.g. &#x27;We have no proof that such artificial flying contraptions can exist!&#x27;. Explaining away natural flight as a supernatural magic only accessible to birds is also eerily similar to the constantly retreating dualistic arguments against a mechanical brain.<p>Even your criticisms of current AI has analogues[2]. Long ago, even in ancient times, there is evidence of small &quot;toy&quot; birds that might have flown much like paper planes. Many similar toy examples existed around the 19th/20th century, too, yet many people still vigorously doubted the possibility of a flying machine that could carry a human.<p>Let&#x27;s compare a paraphrase of common arguments against heavier-than-air human flight, with a paraphrase of your argument:<p><i>Of course we have natural examples of flight, as we see birds all around us. But there is no more evidence for human flight than there is for Bigfoot, leprechauns or space aliens.

7269217,comment,7268909,7268909,14,0,bashcoder,,,"In the second legal battle that Aereo won back in 2012, the lone dissenting judge in the US Court of Appeals in NY had a scathing critique of Aereo&#x27;s scheme. I&#x27;m generally pro-Aereo, but I think HN readers might find this portion of Judge Denny Chin&#x27;s dissent interesting:<p>&quot;Aereo’s “technology platform” is, however, a sham. The system employs thousands of individual dime-sized antennas, but there is no technologically sound reason to use a multitude of tiny individual antennas rather than one central antenna; indeed, the system is a Rube Goldberg-like contrivance, over-engineered in an attempt to avoid the reach of the Copyright Act and to take advantage of a perceived loophole in the law. After capturing the broadcast signal, Aereo makes a copy of the selected program for each viewer, whether the user chooses to “Watch” now or “Record” for later. Under Aereo’s theory, by using these individual antennas and copies, it may retransmit, for example, the Super Bowl “live” to 50,000 subscribers and yet, because each subscriber has an individual antenna and a “unique recorded copy” of the broadcast, these are “private” performances. Of course, the argument makes no sense. These are very much public performances.&quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/620ea2ad-c6c8-4177-84e0-19e5ac2cdb50/1/doc/12-2786_12-2807_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/620ea2ad-c6c8-4177-84e0-19e5ac2cdb50/1/hilite/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/620ea2ad-c6c...</a>",1392877102

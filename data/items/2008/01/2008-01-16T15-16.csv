When they introduced the C++ version you had to explicitly choose to ""upgrade.""  There were some users, including me, who hadn't.

99249,comment,99053,99238,0,0,brlewis,,,"The subtle difference between JSP and BRL is that in JSP %>string<% becomes a statement that outputs the string to a web page, while in BRL ]string[ is simply a string expression.  This makes the same handy syntax available for putting any static/dynamic elements together, whether in web pages, emails, or SQL.  This would be hard to replicate in a non-sexpr language.  Hacking is quick and easy, and centralizing similar code from individual pages is straightforward and natural.  BRL doesn't stay messy as PHP tends to.<p>Other features of BRL could be implemented in a non-sexpr language.  It just seems nobody cares to make languages truly suitable for database-driven web apps.  PHP could have done something like define-input to solve their register_globals problem while retaining a lot of the convenience it had become famous for.  A ResultSet object in any language could be extended to have a very useful subset of the functionality in BRL's sql-repeat.<p>Anyway, I'm not sure the best place for discussion.  Most lispers and schemers don't seem interested in web development.  Maybe you could discuss it here on news.yc.",1200495779

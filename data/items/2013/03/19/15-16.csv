If those other 15 teams don't already have an advanced analytics team in place, then it makes sense not to have the camera until you have a structure in place to make sure of the camera data.<p>It will be interesting with this huge push in basketball over the past couple years to see where this type of analysis leads. The NBA model right now is pretty simple: get two or three superstars, align them with solid role players, and play in championships. It's hard to imagine analytics pushing a team like Houston to be able to beat a team like Miami or Oklahoma City in a seven-game series because the talent gap is so substantial. Houston can play a smarter game but the other teams still function better. What I could see happening, however, if a team like Oklahoma City, while slightly less talented than Miami, can implement insights from this analysis to raise their EV, it might overcome the slightly smaller talent gap. Even in that small sense, it makes more to spend a couple million a year on analytics than it does to pay an average NBA player several million. Since the NBA has both a salary cap and maximum contracts, it pushes the price of an average play up quite a bit, so better value may be had by raising the effectiveness of your current talent than trying to bring in new players.",1363708476

5401605,comment,5398309,5399118,1,0,tomku,,,"It's disturbing how many people here on HN don't seem to realize this.  This isn't some kind of cosmic struggle between good and evil where a hero will arise and vanquish the opposing side entirely - it's two (or more) sides with different opinions about what should be done.  The people on the other side on any given issue are just as sure that they're right as we are that we're right.  They're going to keep trying, just like we would keep trying if we suffer a setback.<p>I find that the good-and-evil view is completely toxic to open discussion.  Everyone assumes that anybody who disagrees with them must be ""the enemy"", and sets out to either change their mind or scare them off.  One side usually succeeds.  The resulting threads are neither interesting nor informative to read, even if you agree with the majority viewpoint - there's too much circlejerking and preaching to the choir.<p>In an effort to have more productive discussions, here are a couple of loose rules that I try to hold myself to when I talk about controversial topics like politics online.  I've found that trying to abide by them makes it a lot easier to have civil discussions with people who hold opposing views.<p>1) Someone disagreeing with me does not make them automatically stupid, malicious or evil.  All three of those terms should be proven to apply only when necessary, not assumed - and the bar of proof should be high.  Assume good faith and intelligent opposition unless I have incontrovertible proof otherwise.<p>2) I am not some kind of oracle of wisdom.  On average, my opinions are roughly as likely to be completely wrong as anyone else's.  On any given issue, almost nobody is going to be completely right.  The few people who are completely right aren't necessarily the ones who have convinced themselves of it beforehand.<p>3) I should try to hold claims that seem to support my position to an even higher standard than I hold the opposition's claims to.  On any sufficiently controversial topic, there will be dishonesty and misinformation going around on all sides, much of which is spread unwittingly by people who think that they're doing the right thing.  Never blindly believe someone because they're saying something that you WANT to be true.<p>4) Disagree with the opinion, not the person.  Other people are complex creatures that hold countless opinions, many of which I probably agree with even if I disagree on other things.  It's never worth it to insult or dehumanize someone because of an opinion they hold, even if I vehemently disagree about it.<p>Sorry that this comment turned out to be rather long and perhaps a bit off-topic, but after finishing it I think it's better in one piece rather than broken up and posted all over the thread.

I could have picked Jerry Maguire, who would be a close second I'd think.  I'd have mentioned Drew Rosenhaus, but tech folks seem more knowledgeable about TV than sports.",1363708255

Food stamps are an excellent economic stimulus. That money goes back into the local economy extremely quickly. On economic grounds alone, I'd support expansion of this form of assistance. Better still, these programs usually don't have a finite number of ""slots"" or a fixed allotment. Even if you don't think someone is worthy of assistance, it's not like they are taking from someone more worthy of assistance.<p>2. The article seems to take issue with the age of the recipients. Do young people--particularly young people who held up their end of ""get educated, get ahead"" bargain who are now unemployed in the Great Recession--not need food? As a person who feels like he caught the last rung of the opportunity ladder, I feel terrible for people 5-10 years younger than me. The least we can do is make sure they get through this with their health intact. If nothing else, it's good business sense.<p>3. The article also takes issue with what these people are buying / cooking. I disagree that many of the items listed in this article are luxury goods. If people can stretch their benefits (see #1), eat nutritious and veggie-rich diet, AND do it with some panache, I'm supposed to be angry? Pfft.<p>In short, this article is rubbish and tries to be inflammatory. Worst yet, it runs the risk of manufacturing outrage at a really good program.<p>If you qualify for food assistance, I highly encourage you take it and use it to enrich your nutrition. I have literally needed to talk people, who were scraping by and eating poorly, into taking assistance because they didn't want to be ""a burden on anyone.""",1363708155

Especially in coaching behavior ""off the ball"". Thats always a game changer.<p>The ghost AI is pretty impressive as well.

5401525,comment,5400055,5401373,3,0,fecak,,,"Fair recruiter reward for a flat percentage?  Fair to the talent, certainly, but assuming I'm getting a low flat percentage that is much better for the talent.  If I'm at 10%, you ask me for $100, and I get you $300 because I'm a master negotiator, I just made an extra $20/hr and you made an extra $180/hr.  I did all the work there, didn't I?  Is your coding going to be 3 times better because I negotiated you a 3 times better rate?  Something to at least consider, from the recruiter's standpoint.<p>Odd incentives are so deeply ingrained in recruiting that it's almost impossible to get them out of the system.  Recruiters have the incentive for motion - people leaving jobs all the time, regardless of whether it is a good career move.  If an agent had tech talent paying $X,000 per year to tell them which moves were best for their career, that would be much more of a positive incentive for all sides.  Instead, the incentive is for recruiters to get people to change jobs, regardless of how happy they are now or how happy they will be in the new job.<p>The pressure to mask final rates is much higher under current conditions.  Take that incentive out entirely by showing your employees/contractors the invoices that you are billing the company.<p>Depressing a candidates understanding of their own value is a valid point, and very unhealthy. I don't think agents can take advantage of coders who understand their value, as they are able to leave.  At a former company, I saw consultants leave over as little as $5/hr.  The only thing that prevents coders from being taken advantage of by recruiters placing them for contract work is the coder's knowledge of their market value.  If they know that, they should never get taken advantage of.  Again, if they are being paid 'true market value', and a recruiter is able to negotiate a rate well above market value, that isn't taking advantage of the coder - that is taking advantage of the company paying the higher rate.",1363707703

But the DOM is meant for working with HTML (and XML) documents -displaying them, updating the display, and getting input from the user- and it's fast enough for that. If you're using the DOM for anything else, you're almost certainly doing something wrong.<p>One of the first rules to being fast in a GUI of any sort, Web-based or otherwise, is simple: don't abuse the runtime. Objective-C's runtime isn't very pretty for performance either, which is why you use the provided APIs when you can. When you can't, you get the data out of the objects and into a more suitable format, work with them there, and put the result back into the objects for display. There were some truly egregious cases of runtime-abuse in the old days: the first OSX versions of OmniWeb come to mind. But the dev community eventually caught up. It's the same with the DOM.<p>That's the thing about jQuery-abuse. jQuery is a very, very good hammer: an awesome tool for working with the DOM. The problem comes when people start to think that every problem looks like a nail: they start using the DOM for everything, including things that it's just plain not designed for. And it works, more or less; it just doesn't work well. That's not a problem with the framework. It's a problem with the user.",1363707406

Maybe you're trying to say the labor bottleneck became harvesting instead of processing?<p>Amazingly it took until 1950 for mechanized harvesting to take over.  Kinda delicate!  Processing is simpler and that was figured out and deployed widely around 1800.  Processing cotton means pulling the seeds out.  Otherwise your tee shirts would sprout if you get sweaty.  Well not seriously, more like the spinners and looms would jam.<p>Old days: hand pick cotton, hand process.<p>1800-1950: hand pick cotton, run thru a steam powered Whitney (dudes last name) gin to process<p>1950-today: Rust (dudes last name) cotton picker, electric motor powered (well, mostly) Whitney cotton gin.  Not much use for human hands anymore.<p>Now indirectly OP was kinda correct in that ""the world"" could tolerate plantation like treatment of poor blacks up to 1950 or so as long as it stayed away from ""the world"".  But once all those poor blacks were unemployed and moved out into the world in factories and stuff, you can't ignore it as easily.   So yeah mechanization (in the 1950s not steam era) led directly to blacks sitting on city busses goin' to factories instead of picking cotton on the neo-plantation and not feeling that sitting in the back of the bus was cool anymore, which led directly to civil rights protests and indirectly to the womens movement and all that.<p>Ops details were all wrong but general message was completely correct.  The gin resulted in lots of black people picking cotton where they got abused and pretty much no one saw or cared, the Rust picker (and WWII) resulted in them being unemployed and moving to factory jobs very much in the public eye, where the abuse became unignorable.",1363707121

My goal was to simulate a basketball game by having every player take an action based on ""expected points per possession"". So if you are covered tightly but a shooter is open, your expected points would be high for passing but low for shooting. This would then be done recursively for every decision, continuously looking ahead until the shot clock expires (so maybe the best move would be to pass it into the post, draw a double team, and then kick it out for an open shot).<p>The obvious problem was that there are a ton of free parameters involved and tons of branching. Every little action creates a new branch of possibilities with its own set of probability distributions. So even if (as they describe in the article) helping out more often decreases the likelihood of the current ball handler making a shot, how does that propagate through the rest of the possession?",1363707032

However there are complications with calling from C extensions back into Python that ultimately killed this approach.<p>After this Stackless evolved to be a much less modified fork of the Python codebase with a bit of platform specific assembly that performed ""stack slicing"". Basically when a coro starts, the contents of the stack pointer register are recorded, and when a coro wishes to switch, the slice of the stack from the recorded stack pointer value to the current stack pointer value is copied off onto the heap. The stack pointer is then adjusted back down to the saved value and another task can run in that same stack space, or a stack slice that was stored on the heap previously can be copied back onto the stack and the stack pointer adjusted so that the task resumes where it left off.<p>Then around 2005 the Stackless stack slicing assembly was ported into a CPython extension as part of py.lib. This was known as greenlet. Unfortunately all the original codespeak.net py.lib pages are 404 now, but here's a blog post from around that time that talks about it [2].<p>Finally the relevant parts of greenlet were extracted from py.lib into a standalone greenlet module, and eventlet, gevent, et cetera grew up around this packaging of the Stackless stack slicing code.<p>So you see, using the Stackless strategy in mainline python would have either required breaking a bunch of existing C extensions and placing limitations on how C extensions could call back into Python, or custom low level stack slicing assembly that has to be maintained for each processor architecture. CPython does not contain any assembly, only portable C, so using greenlet in core would mean that CPython itself would become less portable.<p>Generators, on the other hand, get around the issue of CPython's dependence on the C stack by unwinding both the C and Python stack on yield. The C and Python stack state is lost, but a program counter state is kept so that the next time the generator is called, execution resumes in the middle of the function instead of the beginning.<p>There are problems with this approach; the previous stack state is lost, so stack traces have less information in them; the entire call stack must be unwound back up to the main loop instead of a deeply nested call being able to switch without the callers being aware that the switch is happening; and special syntax (yield or yield from) must be explicitly used to call out a switch.<p>But at least generators don't require breaking changes to the CPython API or non-portable stack slicing assembly. So maybe now you can see why Guido prefers it.<p>Myself, I decided that the advantages of transparent stack switching and interoperability outweighed the disadvantages of relying on non-portable stack slicing assembly. However Guido just sees things in a different light, and I understand his perspective.<p><pre><code>  [1] http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0219/\n  [2] http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/07/py-lib-gems-greenlets-and-pyxml.html</code></pre>",1363705790

But no matter how experienced an entrepreneur you are, or what you've done, you never really know what's going to catch on and what isn't.  And one measure of a good startup founder, IMO, is the ability to balance taking advice from others, with ""keeping your own counsel"".  And sometimes you just have to say ""Hey, Mr. Uber-experienced mentor, serial entrepreneur, VC, former CEO, whatever, ya know, we just think you're wrong and we're doing this anyway"".<p>Even more to the point, sometimes you just have to go out and fail on your own terms, or you'll never be happy with yourself.  Some things really can only be learned through direct experience.",1363705228

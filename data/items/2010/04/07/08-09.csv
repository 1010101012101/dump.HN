1246802,comment,1245103,1245847,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"The primary point wasn't really to reduce the number of addicts, but to manage their addiction and prevent them having to become muggers, hookers or burglars to feed their habit, dying from badly adulterated drug supplies and contracting diseases from bad practices. And, relevant to this article and thread, putting the money earned from these illegal activities straight into the black market for drugs.<p>Despite the horror stories and wild hysteria people can function and hold down jobs while dealing with heroin addiction just like alcoholics can.<p>But still, I've never heard of methadone programs increasing the number of addicts (unless you count the ones that don't die as a result of the intervention). What's the causal link and how do you separate out addicts that would have become addicts anyway? Because if you didn't already have an addiction problem you wouldn't realy need the methadone program in the first place. So some actual science would need to be done to get a clear answer.",1270630478

1246800,comment,1246666,1246666,0,0,zbyszek,,,"What a fantastic way to extinguish through overanalysis any joy that might have been had from the simple pleasure going for a quick drink after work.  I realise that drinking cultures might vary enormously but I just don't recognise the fraught environment that is being presented here;  I have never seen anyone put under pressure for not drinking, and ""White wine won't mix with the whiskey crowd""?  Really?\nI like to go out with work colleagues on occasion.  I find that if you are going to spend eight hours a day with some people it helps to get to know them personally a little bit, and this in turn eases the working relationship.  This doesn't have to be achieved by going to the pub; that's just a social norm.  In some cultures a convivial gathering might mean drinking sweet tea and smoking a hookah, but in mine it involves booze.",1270630443
1246799,comment,1246395,1246725,0,0,mike_organon,,,"Hedonism and ""devil may care"" may be the same thing, but neither are rational self-interest as described by Objectivism.  To answer your question, Objectivism does provide a rational foundation for ethics (obviously, beyond the scope here).  It defines a very precise set of virtues, which are objective, based on facts and reason; which will explain why everyone's rational self-interest can be compared and work compatibly.  It's not at all ""what happens to feel good to you"".  The virtues are principles based on our nature as human beings, not concrete actions like worshiping idols.<p>I won't go into detail, but basically the foundation is: humans need to respect reality, use reason, and not be dependent on others but be productive to survive.  This is how we each survive, and thrive.  The standard of morality is life, ones own human life.  Sacrificing your values is working against your own life.  According to these principles, faith, mysticism, and using force against other people are all bad for your own life.<p>The point of the article is that altruism asks for sacrifice.  Is there a rational basis for accepting it as a moral code?  It's always been founded on religion throughout history.  All the New Atheists do is say instead that altruism (or utilitarianism) feels right to them.  This is not reason.  Why does it feel right?  And what about people for whom it doesn't feel right?<p>I like a lot of what the four horsemen have written and said in defense of science and atheism, and how they debunk religion and some of its more monstrous ethics.  But, when they try to provide a positive ethics, they only offer what feels right.",1270630349

Hitchens would claim that it was their religion that perverted their innate sense of right and wrong. To search for such a sense, I can only imagine you would need to look at very young children and even then it would be hard to discount the cultural/upbringing factor.<p><i>The claim to “innate knowledge,” like the claim to knowledge through faith, is a form of mysticism, the claim to a non-rational, non-sensory means of knowledge.</i><p>Not if its been observed enough. You don't need to be able to explain something down to the quantum mechanical level to assert it exists.<p><i>How can religious belief be wrong if the “innate consciences” of billions of people tell them that it is right?</i><p>What? Historically, most religions were spread by a small number of individuals. How is this innate? (Someone correct me if I'm wrong on the history).<p><i>If man’s ethical ideas were innate, if his biology predisposed him to irrationality, if he had no choice about whether to commit evil, then the entire field of morality—which presupposes that man does choose his actions—would not only be pointless</i><p>No one is claiming there is no choice, merely that our moral decision making procedure is imperfect and/or very flawed.<p><i>Why does an “ethical realist,” who claims to believe that ethical truths are waiting in reality to be discovered, insist that ethics must be grounded “intuitively,” via “irreducible leaps,” rather than rationally</i><p>In  part, this might be because introspection is, in some ways, inherently self limiting. There is nothing logically incoherent about saying that ""this is far as I can break things down.""<p>The whole discussion of how senses are needed to even write a book is silly. You can't take someone's argument to an extreme and then point out how silly it is. The claim isn't (or shouldn't be) that ""senses are useless"" but that ""our senses are not perfect receptors of the outside world.""<p>Overall, the large problem is that the author is looking for a perfect answer to questions when the thought process behind it is still in its infancy.",1270627672

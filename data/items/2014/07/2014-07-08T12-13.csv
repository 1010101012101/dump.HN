Which I can&#x27;t see anything to prevent.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;ve confirmed my intuition about inline in C, and I find inline to be only marginally-useful at best. inline functions are syntactically-prettier than macros, but they lose the other major benefit of macros, which is increased flexibility about typing and being able to interact with syntax in ways that functions can&#x27;t. I get the impression that inline probably didn&#x27;t need to be included in the standard, or, at least, somehow they blew the opportunity to add something more useful.<p>C&#x27;s situation still seems less complicated than C++&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t grasp exactly what C++ &#x27;inline&#x27; actually tells the compiler to do, based on your description. It sounds like &#x27;inline&#x27; in C++ is just a smarter &#x27;static&#x27;.

I noticed writing Common Lisp that I preferred to write code in a functional style, but occasionally I&#x27;d want to bury an imperative update somewhere. Putting a comment saying: &quot;this should be the only use of SETF in the whole algorithm&quot; isn&#x27;t the most satisfying solution.<p>Languages like Common Lisp and Dylan (and SML) have mixed imperative and functional paradigms in a non-controlled way for awhile, but there is some interesting work going on about how to do it in a more controlled way. Much of this work involves limiting aliasing and mutability, or expressing imperative features an effect system, or some combination of the two.<p>Rust is probably the most mainstream example of the former, but Mezzo is another language exploring this area: <a href=""http://protz.github.io/mezzo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://protz.github.io/mezzo</a>. The basic idea is that if you&#x27;ve got the unique reference to an object, or a tree of objects, you can modify it without worrying about how it will affect the rest of the program. Koka is a language that focuses more on the latter, expressing the imperative characteristics of a function through an effect system: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2061.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2061.pdf</a> (section 2.1). The basic idea here is similar to Java&#x27;s exception specifications. If the set of objects potentially modified by a function must be part of its type, then you can use the type system to keep you from modifying an object, or calling a function that does, in a context where the rest of the program doesn&#x27;t expect that object to be modified.",1404823549

8004158,comment,7999814,8003487,2,0,pjc50,,,"Are you arguing that the correct way to do webmail is to have an IMAP client in Javascript running in the browser? I think we&#x27;re talking at cross-purposes here. Suppose I am writing a webmail client. Suppose I am doing this in the usual modern way of writing web applications, which is to retrieve data in JSON or XML and render it client side. I wish to retrieve some data items called &quot;email headers&quot; and &quot;email bodies&quot;. I want the backend to look as much like a database as possible, relational or non-relational. I want the backend to explode mime/multipart, canonicalise things as UTF-8, fix quoted-unprintable etc. That&#x27;s the application I&#x27;m aiming at. Furthermore, I&#x27;d like to standardise the transport layer enough that people can write interchangeable web frontends.<p>As far as I know IMAP itself doesn&#x27;t have any features for whitelisting and spam scoring? Nor calendaring nor global contact lists?<p>&quot;Move&quot; email specifically would be implemented as updating the &quot;location&quot; table. An email would be allowed to be in multiple locations (qv gmail labels).",1404822516

8004149,comment,8002604,8003956,5,0,pbsd,,,"`static` will result in a copy of f for every translation unit (without LTO, at least). `inline` will not. `static inline` is effectively the same as `static`, with a slight hint to the compiler to inline the call.<p>`inline` is used extensively in C++ to make header-only libraries possible; otherwise you&#x27;d get constant symbol clashes during linking. With `static` you would get enormous size blowup. It has little to do with the actual inlining of the call, which is mostly up to the compiler.<p>In C, the situation is complicated. `inline` does not exist in C89. GCC has an interpretation of it for C89 (-std=gnu89), which differs from the C99 interpretation. The only safe way to use inline in C is usually to couple it with `static`, unless you know what you&#x27;re doing. The C99 interpretation of inline is similar to C++, but once again not exactly. For example:<p><pre><code>    // header.h\n    // int f(int x);\n    inline int f(int x) { return x + 1; }\n    // a.h\n    int a(int x);\n    // a.c\n    #include &quot;header.h&quot;\n    #include &quot;a.h&quot;\n    int a(int x) { return f(x); }\n\n    // b.h\n    int b(int x);\n    // b.c\n    #include &quot;header.h&quot;\n    #include &quot;b.h&quot;\n    int b(int x) { return f(x); }\n\n    // main.c\n    #include &quot;a.h&quot;\n    #include &quot;b.h&quot;\n    int main(int argc, char **argv) {\n      return a(argc) + b(argc);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is code that compiles perfectly fine in C++, but is invalid C, because when the compiler decides not to inline the calls to  f, it has no linkage of its own. But when one declares f to have linkage (by uncommenting that line in header.h), we now get &#x27;multiple definition&#x27; errors.",1404822283

8004147,comment,8000475,8003475,1,0,VLM,,,"Thats kind of a big topic.  I&#x27;ll take two tiny little subtopics.<p>The &quot;best&quot; greediest smartest whatever-est minds over centuries of human history have never found a way to keep a global reserve currency for longer than a century or so.  There&#x27;s a famous chart of ranges of time where the Spanish had the worlds reserve currency or the English or whatever.  And the US dollar is gettin kinda old as global reserve currency.  This is very much like the graphs of devastating earthquakes in CA, you can&#x27;t predict the day and time CA will be pretty well flattened, but pretty much everyone in SFO does die and every building gets flattened &quot;about once a century&quot;.  Changing reserve currencies happens about the same way.  I&#x27;d be an idiot to claim it&#x27;ll happen tomorrow or next year, yet its also a near 100% certainty looking at history that my grandkid will grow up under a new reserve currency.  China is getting ready to economically collapse and have their own great depression looking to be about 10x worse than ours, until they have another revolution, so not them, they&#x27;ll be too busy starving and killing each other.  My guess is after the .eu and the euro collapse, the German Mark will be re-issued and become the new global reserve currency that is used for all world trade.  Or some game in name only, where the .de totally take over .eu, rather than the current just mostly having control of .eu, and what we will call a euro will really be a German Mark.  I&#x27;m thinking 5% odds its bitcoin or a derivative digital currency, maybe 55% odds its German Mark or synonym, and the remainder is an unclear mix of a new S.U. currency, or maybe Africa will get itself together (gonna happen sooner or later unless someone stops them).  Or the century old battle of hemispheres has the south rising, perhaps some kind of Pan South American euro-like &quot;thing&quot; will arise.  At least most of them speak more or less the same language.  So we&#x27;re getting a new reserve currency &quot;within a generation&quot; and it definitely isn&#x27;t going to be the dollar.  This isn&#x27;t the end of the world, London is still a nice place to visit, but it does mean certain changes will occur.<p>Another topic worth discussion is the end of cheap oil, which has more or less already happened (unless you&#x27;re getting gallons of gas for 90 cents in the USA?).  All the fields worldwide are in decline and discovery and production per dollar invested is in permanent long term decline.  So all business models oriented around pumping oil/natgas out of the ground are on borrowed time.  Generally any good news as a counterexample is innumerate, either no understanding of quantities (so the lifetime production of a TDP plant is about 5 minutes of USA consumption, awesome) or the standard manipulation of statistics (so production at one well went up 10% month on month last month therefore if you extend that into infinity we&#x27;re going to have worldwide oil prices of 10 cents/barrel) or just technoutopia, usually horribly out of date &quot;Hey guys, I just heard about this new thing, ethanol plant, and its going to save the world&quot; LOL thats already crashed and burned.<p>There is probably some connection in that the USA .mil will probably hold things together enough to keep the $ as the reserve currency as long as oil tankers import oil into the USA.  Once that stops, and it&#x27;ll stop soon enough on existing trends, the motivation to maintain global conomic control will likely evaporate and thats when we&#x27;ll get a new global reserve trading currency.  Watch for S.A. oil exports to irreversibly start to fall and then expect some financial chaos.  Everyone else, .mx, UK north sea, all in decline already (LOL Britain has gone from being a natgas exporter to being an importer in just the last couple years)<p>The middle class is made of natgas, which is interesting.  You turn natgas into AN fertilizer and turn that into corn and turn corn syrup into lots of middle class biomass.  Also you turn natgas into plastic consumer garbage and that gives the middle class something to advertise, make, ship, retail, purchase, use, aspire to...  Without natgas that whole segment of society simply evaporates away.  What kind of fish you got when you take the water out of the fish tank?",1404822258

8004074,comment,8002602,8004000,5,0,nmrm,,,"<i>(this is a living comment until the first reply. Sorry.)</i><p>I have four major points:<p>1. You can assess even major-agnostic, general skills in content-specific ways. Such assessments are far less likely to have the negative externalities of more generic tests (e.g. first or last semester &quot;Literature&quot; courses which are basically CLA et al. boosters. These most definitely exist). But even still, I think this is a bad idea and too ripe for abuse.<p>2. Generic &quot;Critical Thinking&quot; is <i>often</i> not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, and <i>some experts claim</i> it is not statistically correlated with the sort of critical thinking <i>purported to be mastered</i> in science and mathematics courses. (Oh, CLA really likes hedge words. They mean you&#x27;re smart... I mean... that &quot;you&#x27;ve likely acquired transferable critical thinking skills&quot;  [1].)<p>3. Higher Ed shouldn&#x27;t be responsible for filling in gaps in  High School and even Elementary education. Also, <i>grammar</i>!? I rest my case!<p>4. The CLA is computer-graded (no, really, it is [1]).<p>--<p><i>1. A Problem with Generic Critical Thinking</i><p>Generic &quot;critical thinking&quot; is often nothing more than &quot;the right kind of sophistry&quot;. The author of [1] agrees with this sentiment w.r.t the CLA (although, it should be stated, not in general. See the source; what follows are my own opinions, not those of the author of [1]).<p>In addition to pointing out that any answer along the lines of &quot;IDK&quot; is treated as sufficient, he also notes that the model answers provided for the CLA are full of logical fallacies.<p>But the author of [1] really hits the nail on the head in this paragraph:<p><i>This is exactly the kind of instruction and practice students receive in a dedicated critical-thinking or informal logic course. Critical-thinking skills are not statistically significantly enhanced by content-specific courses like introduction to philosophy or chemistry, or by content-independent courses such as symbolic logic.</i><p>I argue that the what the CLA measures is not what colleges and universities are or should ever be intended to teach. Instead, it measures a tortured form of &quot;critical thinking&quot; that is somehow not statistically significantly improved even by courses in the hard sciences and mathematics. Not even by courses in formal logic! Only by courses in informal logic. If science and math don&#x27;t improve &quot;critical thinking&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;critical thinking&quot; is supposed to mean. Except, of course, the right kind of sophistry+.<p>Ergo, it&#x27;s likely that if performance on the CLA significantly improves, it will be because colleges and universities are teaching to the test in the guise of &quot;Critical Thinking and Informal Logic&quot; (although I&#x27;m sure universities will have better names for their mandatory freshman CLA courses).<p>I&#x27;m very concerned that the true humanities -- one place where actual critical thinking is taught -- will be gutted in order to cover the costs of such instruction (I already know of one instance where this has happened).<p><i>2. Higher Education Should Assume the Basics</i><p>As for grammar and mechanics, things are even simpler. Colleges and universities are absolutely not responsible for those sorts of basic skills.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.assessmentupdate.com/sample-articles/a-fatal-flaw-in-the-collegiate-learning-assessment-test.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.assessmentupdate.com/sample-articles/a-fatal-flaw...</a><p>+ My use of the word sophistry is definitely intentional. It&#x27;s worth noting that the sort of persuasion rooted in a combination of informal logic and careful rhetoric (&quot;always use hedge words&quot; is a modern equivalent) is exactly the sort of thing that the Sophists were known for!<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a huge fan of assessment-driven education. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right for institution-level assessment at the higher education level. Not unless it&#x27;s content-specific.",1404821252

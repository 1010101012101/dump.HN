Any decent PHP framework deals with SQL injection or XSS in the same way decent Ruby/Python/etc framework does.

1638993,comment,1637345,1638745,0,0,Confusion,,,"You can also make anything callable in Ruby: just provide a call method.  The parenthesis will still work as may be expected in Ruby, but, as several folks said before: in Ruby parenthesis are not used to call anything. A method is called simply be mentioning it. Anything that follows is an argument and sometimes parameters are needed for disambiguation of the parameters. This is counterintuitive, only because it differs from most other languages. If you want to postpone evaluation, you have to wrap the method call in a closure that you .call later: in Ruby a method is not a closure and not a function pointer. It's different than in many other languages, but that alone doesn't make it inconsistent.",1282921148
1638992,comment,1638460,1638947,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"The solution is that IE 6, 7, & 8 won't load Flash for the HTML5 video tag either, so the same Flash fallback (probably delivering the same H.264 file given to HTML5 browsers) works for all of these highly popular browsers which currently account for something like 80-90% of all browsers between them.<p>Firefox only has to worry about niche, tech-forward sites that feel they can disregard all pre HTML5 browsers and also actively choose to ignore Firefox (and Opera) as well by not providing a WebM fallback video. No ordinary business can afford to simply refuse to deliver a Flash video to 1/3rd of their audience when they've already built it and are serving it to another 1/3rd on older version of IE. (This obviously occurring at some future time when the HTML5 video delivery is preferred over Flash for any platform other than the Apple ones that don't have Flash, otherwise the Flash would be going out to 99% of browsers anyway).<p>There's not much downside for Firefox except pissing off people who really passionately hate Flash, but are quite happy with H.264's patent situation. I'm thinking the crossover is pretty small on those two populations and probably shrinking greatly now that Apple has let Adobe use their hardware acceleration API for H.264 decode, certainly not big enough to derail a browser used by tens of millions of ordinary people.",1282921137

This is a case where FB has, for some reason, signalled that they want to work with YC companies, and specifically YC companies. As some people pointed out already, maybe this is them outsourcing R&D. So let's accept that for a second, that this is a way to get them to outsource R&D b/c the FBfund isn't working. If that's the case, that means that they're looking to acquire companies. And not just any company, though that's always the case with any company anywhere with sufficient resources and an eye on growth, but specifically YC companies.<p>If we presume that the odds of an exit of a YC company before this interview were even across all industries (i.e., that no matter whether they were into working in travel or B2B or whatever a company's odds of being acquired/going public where the same) that is certainly not the case anymore. The odds of an exit for a YC/FB company probably just went up dramatically. In actuality, it seems like it went up dramatically; it's too early to tell if it actually did. And maybe not just b/c the YC company is not going to get acquired by FB, but b/c the YC company can get revenue quicker with preferential access to FB's revenue making methods.<p>But here's what the cynic in me thinks: based on the RFS[1], this seems really like a way for a cheap and easy way for FB, which has has major credibility issues with Connect, etc. to get good publicity for Facebook Instant Personalization. Since YC is super, super hot right now and just came off their demo day, the tech news was all about them. I don't know if money switched hands -- after all, if YC took a million (cheap for this buzz) that would be enough for them to invest in 66 companies at $15K a pop but with absolutely no risk to them since it's other people's money. If so, it probably wasn't enough.<p>In addition, YC's other RFS have been generic and in fields that have been buzzworthy enough that they didn't need YC entrants to attack the problem. In other ways, ""The Future of Journalism,"" ""Things Built on Twitter,""  and ""iPad applications,"" -- these are not solving obscure but lucrative problems[2]. It's simply a way for YC to signal their interest in a hot space and that they want to work with the best of the breed in this space. Now, I presume, they're getting paid for it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/rfs7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/rfs7.html</a><p>[2] I'm assuming that there was no similar deal announced with Twitter or Apple, which I feel like I would have heard about, but I could be wrong.",1282920865

You need to have a sponsor who is either a relative and US citizen, or you are already employed by a US company on a work visa and they are willing to sponsor your green card application.  (I am in the second category.)<p>Even if you have an employer willing to sponsor your green card application, the preliminary paperwork can take over a year before you're officially in the green card pipeline.  How long you have to wait depends on your country of origin.  Canadians can expect to wait at least two years, Indians and Chinese five years or more.  But the kicker is that if you lose your job or change companies while you're in the pipeline, <i>the whole process restarts</i>!  (Unless you're in the final stage, but that's comparatively short compared to the whole process.)  That is, if you can find a new job.

One of Whorf's examples of this was the supposedly many words for 'snow' in the Inuit language, which has later been shown to be a misrepresentation[13]  but also for example how the Hopi language describes water with two different words for drinking water in a container versus a natural body of water. These examples of polysemy  served the double purpose of showing that indigenous languages sometimes made more fine grained semantic distinctions than European languages and that direct translation between two languages, even of seemingly basic concepts like snow or water, is not always possible.<p>Another example in which Whorf attempted to show that language use affects behavior came from his experience in his day job as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector[13]. On inspecting a chemical plant he once observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels and one for the empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels no-one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels, although this was potentially much more dangerous due to the highly flammable vapors that still existed in the barrels. He concluded that the use of the word 'empty' in connection to the barrels had led the workers to unconsciously regarding them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion from the vapors. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg[14] as not actually demonstrating the causality between the use of the word empty and the action of smoking, but instead being an example of circular reasoning. Steven Pinker in The Language Instinct ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human sight rather than language.<p>Whorf's most elaborate argument for the existence of linguistic relativity regarded what he believed to be a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi.[15] He argued that in contrast to English and other SAE languages, the Hopi language does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct, countable instances, like ""three days"" or ""five years"" but rather as a single process and consequentially it does not have nouns referring to units of time. He proposed that this view of time was fundamental in all aspects of Hopi culture and explained certain Hopi behavioral patterns.</i>",1282920154

A more sophisticated Naive Bayes system could reject classifying an animal as human based on having four legs, and conversely a non-naive system i.e. one that used joint probabilities of the features, might not be more likely to.<p>I guess the most rational way to do that would be to express and calculate the conditional probabilities with some statistical distance, like the # of standard deviations.

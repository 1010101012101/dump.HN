When you get it, it's actually a MINIMUM of 20 lbs required.   20lbs is the balance point:  if you have less than that, it stays permanently up.   But if you have less than 20lbs you can take out one of the springs.   Of course, most woodworkers using it for it's intended purpose use 20lbs of hardwood, but I use a jerry rig that's much lighter.     Then I added a 30lb 30"" monitor, and it works great.   The springs lift 20lbs, so you only have to put in 10lbs of effort to lift 30 lbs.<p>I'd worry about adding a lot of heavy weight to the front of it where there is more leverage, but I wouldn't hesitate to add another 50lbs to the back.

2395777,comment,2395546,2395546,1,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"OK, with n growing without bound, and the ratio between n and pi being transcendental, the value of sin(2n) basically bounces around randomly.<p>cos(n) is also effectively random, and there's no real relationship between the sin and cos because everything's ""random.""<p>So I'd bet it doesn't converge.<p>In fact, for any epsilon we can find N such that |sin(2.pi.N)|<epsilon/4.  Call the sum up to that point S - it will not be zero, and then look at the sum up to 2N.  That will be very nearly 2S.  Take one step further and the sum will be roughly 2S+0.7754.<p>I think that's enough to show it doesn't converge, but I'm typing this between other tasks and don't have time to be more formal.  If anyone really cares then I'll work on it later.<p>But no, it doesn't converge.",1301656444

Memory champions claim to have quite a lot of palaces and ways to cram information in them (for example, for memorisation of digits of pi), but my personal experience is not that big as of yet.<p>As a matter of fact, an informal list of places I can use as memory palace, as I know them from memory ranges around 70 ""palaces"" with between 4 and 15 rooms each. If you cram 3 items per room its around 700 things to remember. But you can get better.<p>You can also use association (I am about to write a post about it) to get facts about books, people, things without using a new palace for each kind of data type.",1301655904

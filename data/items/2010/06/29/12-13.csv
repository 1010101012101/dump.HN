That’s evolution, not stealing."" then goes on to say that's Google's only choice?<p>I don't believe it. Google wasn't first to market with apps like Gmail or Google Docs, but their implementation is arguably much better than the competition. Why cant Google do this with social networking?<p>He says: ""What Google shouldn’t do – must not do – is try to tie the service to other Google products for the wrong reasons."" This makes no sense. I think a social networking service that utilized Google's other services effectively would be a very powerful thing. I could see tight integration between events and your Google calender, or sharing Google docs/waves easily with friends. Google has a massive portfolio of very useful services; it would be foolhardy to not use them if they were to attempt a ""Facebook clone"" as the author so lovingly calls it.",1277816325

1471201,comment,1469363,1470918,0,0,loewenskind,,,"> ""it violates the current body of science"" argument.<p>Oh I agree, I just put a lot more weight in the ""testing"" side than the ""it violates our current understanding"" side because our current understanding is constantly changing.  It is more additions and amendments than rewrites, as you mentioned earlier but if there are components out there that we currently can't detect then some of our foundations could be wrong.<p>I was just addressing one part of your post.  I had no intention of defending Homeopathy nor anything they say.  I was specifically thinking of some extra ""dimension"" or realm that is effected by what we can currently observe.  I can't point to any evidence that such a thing might exist but I wouldn't dismiss the possibility since I have no way of saying it doesn't (nor would I spend much time thinking about or trying prove/disprove it).<p>>However, one of my big beefs with homeopathy is that it doesn't say, ""we don't know what the mechanism is"" -- which would be OK with me, because ""I don't know"" is a perfectly acceptable answer in science! -- and it doesn't provide a plausible mechanism that fits within the current scientific body. Rather, instead it presents a ""scientific-sounding"" mechanism that actually flies in the face of what we do know.<p>Agreed.  I would only add the amendment:<p>""and it doesn't provide a plausible mechanism that fits within the current scientific body, <i>nor demonstrate where the current body of science is in error</i>"".<p>That is, I don't think they must stay within the current scientific body but they <i>must</i> either show conclusively that the current scientific body is flawed in some way, or simply show something conclusive that seems to contradict that body and leave it to others to work out why.<p>I expect it to happen in my lifetime that some discovery will be made that demonstrates a large body of science is built on foundations that were misunderstood.  But I expect this to happen scientifically based on observation/tests, not by a group fantasizing about what they would need to prop up their beliefs and then claiming it to be true.<p>I don't address any more of your post because I think we're in agreement.",1277816229

It confuses your point IMO.<p>However, your ""doing it badly"" is a matter of opinion, no? I use a mac at work as I mentioned elsewhere. I enjoy it a great deal. It's hard to go back and forth between the Mac there and Windows at home because the way the mouse moves is just... different. But I do it...<p>I was planning on dumping my Vista laptop at home for a macbook but then I gave Win7 a try. You can scoff at my experiences if you'd like, but Win7 is the only OS i've ever purchased. I think Vista is one of the worst OS experiences I've ever had (2nd to ME) and hands-down I think Win7 is the best.<p>It's built-in keyboard shortcuts for moving and docking windows across multiple monitors are invaluable to me. I installed the 3rd party app to give me similar function on my mac and it was... dismal.<p>My Win box is as reliable as my Mac. I restart them both on average once a month or so.<p>There are several places Mac kills Win7. Tasks like adding a network printer, for example. But those are rare, relatively speaking.<p>The Win7 taskbar is no doubt inspired by the Dock but it's far more useful IMO.

But it can be easier to open vim in the console for something quick or if you're doing something over the network (say, ssh). For example, I use the terminal often for quick commit messages or short edits and consistently for Mutt. Regular vim is easier with Mutt rather than kicking open G/Mvim and then returning to the terminal to send the mail. (You can automate the right return to focus for the terminal when you close G/Mvim, but it's still a bit jarring.) For very long edits on a good connection, I will open sshfs and use M/Gvim, but in general ssh + vim is simpler.",1277813533

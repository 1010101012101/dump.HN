The problem then becomes maintaining quality of service as you scale, and efficiency of operations to keep your margins as healthy as possible.

8440815,comment,8439977,8439977,0,0,nashashmi,,,"This article completely misses the point of having wider lane path ways.  Wider lanes help increase the speeds of vehicles and studies have shown that high speed traffic works far better than slow traffic. Just look up ramp metering where they deliberately keep too much traffic off of highways to maintain speed and maintain safety and maintain efficiency of roads.<p>The cases where narrow street widths work better are places where there is more stop and go traffic like downtown areas where majority of the residences are crowded with store-front development. There instead of insisting on narrow lanes, you should insist on complete street designs that appropriately designs for all kinds of traffic.<p>New urbanist movements seem to be behind this kind of lunacy of trying to create traffic conditions more difficult for cars. In New York, this trend has been set of by the Bloomberg administration and is labeled/marketed as traffic calming. It is really traffic impeding and is the center piece design of urban environments. I admit there are various benefits to it, but the underlying motivations are to be anti-gas guzzling vehicles.",1412989109

Particularly around elections.<p>Living in Los Angeles I see people crossing the street ALL THE TIME without even looking for traffic.  I mean, they just continue walking off the sidewalk as if cars did not even exist.  Having traveled to many parts of the world and all corners of the US this has always been rather perplexing to me.  It is somewhat unique to California, I think.  To see people with such low apparent common sense is jaw dropping. Anywhere else in the world they&#x27;d be flattened in a microsecond.  In Amsterdam you&#x27;d have 15 bikes pile on top of you.  Unbelievable.<p>My point is that there are a ton of factors behind how people get hurt or die on and around roads.

Crap in Crap Out.  Bias in Bias Out.

In other words, more crap out.<p>We have far more important things to worry about than to devote billions of dollars to repainting all of our streets.  Take that money and use it to lift people out of poverty.

These factors would probably make it more difficult in DotA to place wards in the jungle in a way that is highly likely to yield solid intel — you can get a fairly good amount of safe coverage with a defensive ward on the cliff near river, as well as along the river exit once you&#x27;ve advanced past the river. To the best of my knowledge, you&#x27;re just not going to learn as much from jungle wards in DotA, because of the sight lines and the difficulty of enemy jungle invasion (and perhaps because of the random invisibility rune spawns, though I don&#x27;t know how much of a factor that is). Contrast all of that with LoL: accessing the enemy jungle is comparatively easy, and key ward placements on the enemy side (especially tri-brush, blue buff brush, and river junction at wraith camp) are almost certain to be high-information investments.<p>Additionally, in LoL you have to teleport to a friendly creep, structure, or ward; the secondary nature of a ward as a rally point is something that increases the stakes of ward superiority. In DotA (if I&#x27;m not mistaken) the teleport limitation is not the same, so the pressure is not the same. I&#x27;m sure there are also itemization and ability factors that I have no knowledge of whatsoever. If I&#x27;m horribly wrong on this, I welcome a more experienced perspective!<p>EDIT: `chc has more specific intel on the wards themselves.

The reason League of Legends used to devolve into a vision battle was that both teams could just keep placing wards as long as they had gold. So one team&#x27;s support player would just go around placing wards and removing any wards they found, while the other team&#x27;s support player would go around re-placing their destroyed wards and destroying the other team&#x27;s wards that went up in the same place. Basically, it was a giant vision circle. Dota never offered unlimited vision.<p>Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the three systems:<p>Dota:<p>Observer Wards: Invisible, last seven minutes and give vision of a fairly large area, but there are only four available to each team at a given time. Cost 150 gold for a stack of 2.<p>Sentry Wards: Invisible, last four minutes and reveal invisible things in a fairly large area, but don’t grant vision of an area (so you need to find some other way to get vision of the area where the invisible thing you want to see is). Cost 200 gold for a stack of 2. There is no limit to Sentry Wards.<p>Old League of Legends:<p>Sight Wards: Invisible, last three minutes, give vision of a fairly large area, take three hits to destroy. Cost 75 gold. Unlimited.<p>Vision Wards: Invisible, last three minutes, take three hits to destroy. Give vision of the same area as Sight Wards, and also reveal invisible things in that area. Cost 150 gold. Unlimited.<p>New League of Legends:<p>Sight Wards: Invisible, last 3 minutes, give vision of a fairly large area, take 3 hits to destroy. Each player can only place three Sight Wards at a time. Placing a fourth will destroy your oldest ward. Cost 75 gold.<p>Vision Wards: Visible, last forever until destroyed, give vision of the same area as Sight Wards, reveal invisible things, take 5 hits to destroy. You can only place one Vision Ward.

In the American legal tradition (and the English one from which it derives), courts are not investigative bodies, they are determinative ones, which can only rule on matters brought up by one of the parties. This is completely different from how courts operate in jurisdictions based on Napoleonic law, in which the functions of prosecutor and judge and virtually combined.

One mistake can cost you your hero, which can cost you your hero if the death is untimely. (I guess DotA derivatives are more forgiving in that sense.) But there aren&#x27;t that many units and heroes to learn, so at least after some time you won&#x27;t be taken completely aback when your hero gets ensnared, critical striked (struck?) hexed and then critical striked again. I mean, it <i>will</i> happen, but the possibility would have already crossed your mind.<p>There is a ton of finesse and micro to playing a game like WC3, but learning to play the game isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> hard; there isn&#x27;t terribly much that you need to memorize, and then you can concentrate on strategy and mechanics. DotA (derivatives), on the other hand, is built in such a way as to be absolutely relentless towards anyone who isn&#x27;t already experienced.<p>WC3 is hard to learn, but not unreasonably so for an RTS. It also has a high skill ceiling. DotA (derivatives) are really hard to learn (I won&#x27;t comment on the skill ceiling, since I don&#x27;t know). Yet, people - casual players included - have embraced DotA over the humble original game.

Again, it&#x27;s obvious that if you expand <i>one road</i> in a congested city then it will get full of cars again, because it takes the overflow from all of the other congested roads. And if you reduce congestion in general then people might choose to drive more often.<p>But this does not persist as a 1:1 relationship. China has proved as much by building a bunch of empty highways and cities, as is also demonstrated by urban highways carrying more traffic than rural highways with the same number of lanes. The &quot;problem&quot; is that if you have a lot of congested highways then you need to add a lot of lanes before you&#x27;ll hit saturation, but that hardly proves that it can&#x27;t be done. The observed 1:1 relationship in some locations is easily explained as a result of widespread insufficient infrastructure investment, resulting in roads with insufficient capacity even after the expansion.",1412985883

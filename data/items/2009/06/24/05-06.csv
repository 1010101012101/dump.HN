671662,comment,671594,671594,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Sad fact: Not going to happen anytime soon. Definitely not for Outlook 2010.<p>They turned to Word for HTML editing/rendering in Outlook 2007 because there was no Internet Explorer team during development. IE7 was released in 2007, but Office 2007 was in development since at least 2003. No IE team means there was no one to send design change requests to. Office doesn't like being at the mercy of other teams, so they break dependencies whenever possible. The lack of an IE team was a perfect example of why this is a successful practice for them.<p>Word offers a significantly better editing experience and most email clients only render a small subset of standard HTML anyway. Gmail, for example, throws away all headers including CSS. It was a perfectly reasonable cost/benefit trade off for the Outlook team to switch to an editor and renderer they could directly change or influence. There wasn't a big loss of compatability, but there was some. Most HTML email in actual usage renders the same between Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007 because they would have to be written to the lowest common denominator in order to render correctly in most other mail clients as well.<p>Outlook 2007 added DRM to emails which, besides being the most annoying thing ever, was a feature highly demanded by customers. This feature is based on Word's DRM.<p>So, putting on my Microsoft PM hat... let's do a cost benefit analysis of switching Outlook to use the IE8 rendering engine:<p>Benefits:<p>1) HTML email authors (who don't pay us anything, by the way) will have a slightly easier time now.<p>2) HTML email authors will have a significantly easier time in the distant future.<p>Costs:<p>1) Second release to break HTML mail compatability in a row.<p>2) Will need to re-implement DRM. This includes a full battery of security reviews.<p>3) Will need to re-implement all recent editing improvements.<p>4) Once again at the mercy of the IE8 team, who already have a huge backlog of work and probably don't care about our DCRs.<p><i>shrug</i> Not going to happen in 2010. Probably won't happen in the next release either. When some version of IE supports 100% of all standards and is as fast as a hypothetical future Chrome, such that they have time to deal with the Outlook team, then maaaybe, just maybe they can tackle this... two releases of Office later.... If you're lucky.",1245822735

In other words, I would guess that most kids from the suburbs learn to use weapons from authority figures<p>Yes, they were controlling for every environmental factor they could.  (FWIW, this isn't a ""gun"" study.  Gun stuff is just one of the things that popped out.)  We're comparing kids from the same neighborhoods.<p>And, while legal gun ownership is higher in the suburbs, it isn't unknown in the inner city and it isn't universal in the suburbs.  As a result, we can observe ""learn from parents"" vs ""learn from peers"" in both situations.<p>> but they were probably never going to fall on the wrong side of the law anyhow.<p>As I wrote, their criminality wasn't affected, just their use of weapons.<p>Correlation vs causation and all that.",1245822603

671652,comment,671621,671621,0,0,Shooter,,,"Billy Mays was a guest at a hotel where I used to work in the 90's.  He asked me to copy some documents for him, and verbally acknowledged the hotel charge for copy services. He was in a hurry and was very impatient. When I finished copying the documents, which were hundreds of pages long and had to be fed in manually one page at a time, he refused to pay.  He basically didn't think I should charge him BECAUSE he was Billy Mays.  I didn't know at the time who he was, not that it would have made any difference, and I thought he must be a retired sports figure (I knew who WILLIE Mays was, but somehow still thought Billy was a formal baseball player.)<p>I usually waived the copy fee if it was just a few pages or the person was nice, but because Mays was a jerk about it I charged the maximum fee to his credit card...and I was also less than discreet when he disputed the ""special"" movie entertainment he had ordered.  Because nothing says celebrity like weird porn.

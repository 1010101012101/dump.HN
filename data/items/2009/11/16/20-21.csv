Packaging mortgages into investment vehicles was a horrifically bad affair which was at least the number two ingredient.  How do you manage to take 10,000 mortgagees that on average represent 7% 30 year loans and end up with a packaged investment that rates at 20% return?  This involved some loose and unregulated mark-to-market math and relied on home turnover in a superheated market.  Once leveraged instrument after instrument has been added into this unregulated space, you end up with an enormous unmeasurable structure of debt that has little to do with houses.<p>So it may well be true that mortgage tax deductions were a necessary ingredient, this alone did not cause the debt explosion.",1258404800

I've recently decided to take the plunge and learn how to code. I have my own startup that I foolishly outsourced, and I've decided that there really is no other way around it then sitting down and learning to hack myself, and then iterating the product once I have a better handle on things.<p>Items I submit for consideration:<p>1. I have a site already running (more or less, it will be at least within the week) on rails. I have no idea what is going on, but I'd like to figure it out and be able to change functionalities as I learn about my customers.<p>2. I have never coded before. Not even once. I still don't understand what a hash is, really. Aside from taking a class, I really don't know the best way to learn. I've been reading books, but reading hasn't been doing much for me, since I'm not really absorbing the material. I want to try 'testing' things out...I don't know if that makes sense, but I feel like if I have exercises to do, I will understand concepts much faster then simply reading.<p>3. I have availability to take courses. But, I do not know what courses to take. I am based out of the bay area, and am open to suggestions for classes for beginners.<p>4. I have a self-imposed deadline of four months. Is this enough time to be able to handle simple, workable functions on rails? (The common answer, my guess is, is that it's completely up to me. But I'm just looking for perspective. what can I possibly get accomplished, if I am starting from scratch?)<p>Also, supplemental 5: Would there be anyone out there who would be willing to learn with me? I think having a partner would help tremendously, but I don't know where to find people in such a situation.<p>Please let me know your thoughts.",1258404746

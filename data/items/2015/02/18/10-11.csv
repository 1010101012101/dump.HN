9067874,comment,9066762,9067853,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Funnily enough, if you read the extensive replies I&#x27;ve already written in this thread, you&#x27;ll see that this decision <i>was</i> made out of concern for the employee based on the unique circumstances of our arrangement, and has nothing to do with my image.<p>If I was worried about my image, I would&#x27;ve fired her in person so that I could tell everyone &quot;Oh me, oh my, I would NEVER fire an employee without a full honor guard and 21-gun salute!&quot;, and so that she couldn&#x27;t tell anyone &quot;Oh, that guy didn&#x27;t even have the balls to fire me in person.&quot; I also wouldn&#x27;t post about this on HN defending the executives of major multinational corporations, known worldwide for their abysmal IQs and inability to perform basic critical reasoning functions.<p>I&#x27;m honestly not seeing how opting not to do this in person can be perceived as &quot;good for image&quot;. Can you clarify?<p>Like I said, I&#x27;ve fired people in person before and I&#x27;m not going to shrink from that duty if it&#x27;s truly the best course of action. But I&#x27;m not going to insist on it at the cost of the employee&#x27;s dignity just so that I can tell everyone &quot;I have never fired someone in a non-sound-bite friendly manner&quot;.<p>The C-level that fired everyone by pre-recorded conference call most likely went through a similar dilemma, and I sympathize with him. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an objectively bad way to fire a group of people. Is the alternative, that your peers start getting called into an office and told individually that they&#x27;re being fired while you sit there in panic with continued access to corporate resources just waiting for your turn, really that much better just because there&#x27;s some lackey that can stare into your soul and relay the message from corporate HQ? Or could the C-level be seen as a coward for not delivering the message himself and making a lackey take the blame?<p>I believe people have romanticized this process far too much. I don&#x27;t believe a staredown is so obviously superior to alternate forms. I understand that you just said it is and that the only reason I didn&#x27;t do it this time was because I was worried about my image (again, what?), but I don&#x27;t find that to be a convincing argument. As I said elsewhere, I&#x27;d prefer to be fired remotely. A couple of the other guys in this thread have expressed that too. I felt that was the appropriate course in this situation.<p>It&#x27;s not easy to be the boss and make these calls. Everyone is going to have an opinion without the information or perspective and there are people that are going to dislike you for the decisions you make, no matter what they are. It&#x27;s part of the territory. It&#x27;d sure help hacker entrepreneurs if we dropped the PC line once in a while and had some real talk.",1424257190

9067840,comment,9066762,9067755,0,0,cookiecaper,,,">In the worst case if an in-person meeting takes that long to arrange then something like skype or even a phone call is still a much better fallback than email.<p>I guess the root of the thing here is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad to fire someone over email if that&#x27;s appropriate for the situation and personality. I didn&#x27;t give this list as proof that I couldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve fired her in person if I REALLY wanted to, I gave it to provide just a bit of context around the circumstances that influenced the tradeoff.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s possible she&#x27;ll go around and think about how I&#x27;m such a spineless coward because I didn&#x27;t make her cry in the coffee shop when I fired her, but it&#x27;s probable she&#x27;d go around thinking I was a spineless coward or INSERT_INSULT_HERE even if I met her in person and did it. That&#x27;s the point. A friend recently fired an employee in person and was informed that he would come back and &quot;rape him [my friend] in the ass&quot;. Obviously the setting is not the most important part of the firing; the most important part is that it&#x27;s happening at all.<p>At this point it may be worthwhile to indicate that these positions aren&#x27;t all for well-tempered, highly-compensated hackers or engineers. The worker I fired did not have advanced skills and neither did the worker my friend fired. Some people in these groups are less objective about these involuntary departures than you&#x27;d expect in a conventional white-collar setting.<p>It would&#x27;ve been highly unusual to procure a space that would&#x27;ve been appropriate for this type of meeting and she&#x27;d immediately be tipped off that something weird was happening. This could put her in a <i>worse</i> frame of mind; if she enters fancy virtual office and thinks, &quot;Wow, this is a nice place, I wonder if we&#x27;re going to move here, I bet some really big super cool deals are happening that I&#x27;m about to hear about&quot;, is that really going to make the situation less volatile?<p>And again, I&#x27;m doing all of this... why, exactly? So she&#x27;ll have one less checkbox in the &quot;things to hate&quot; list? She can put plenty there if she wants to, &quot;fired me by email&quot; is really immaterial, and again, even though it may <i>look</i> worse to fire via email, I did end up doing it out of concern for <i>her</i> long-term well-being, not mine, since it doesn&#x27;t really make a big difference to me either way -- it&#x27;s just an hour or so of my time, for her it&#x27;s a big life change, and we usually meet at a public place near her home (for <i>her</i> convenience, of course), which is where this would&#x27;ve potentially gone down.",1424256214

It&#x27;s the difference between a coinductive (ie: infinitely looping, like a game loop) computation that adds new information to its &quot;memory&quot; in each iteration (which sounds monadic), compressing its inputs to accommodate that information, and <i>then</i> generating an output... vs a super-exponential lookup table that performs the input-output mappings without actually engaging in any side-effecting or monadic computation at all.<p>So yes, when you think of these two vastly different ways of writing down a &quot;cognitive-style&quot; computation, it becomes clear that one of them maps relatively well to what we think of when we say &quot;mind&quot;, while the other doesn&#x27;t, and <i>Searle is conveniently eliding the distinction</i>.",1424255702

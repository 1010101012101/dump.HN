6681244,comment,6680763,6680763,24,0,lsh123,,,"Lets start from the beginning: the NSA &quot;hack&quot; became possible because Google (and its security team) made bad assumptions about the security of the connection between Google&#x27;s data centers and did not encrypt the traffic. Basically, this is security 101: protect data at rest and protect data in flight. So, sorry but I think the better subject for discussion would be how badly Google screwed up, not how evil is NSA. Moreover, it is not clear if other governments or criminals also had access to the users&#x27; data (e.g. in Google&#x27;s data centers located outside of the US). So far Google did not produce any public post-mortem thus we have no clue how bad was the problem.<p>P.S. I am sure I will get smashed in the comments, so let me say right away that NSA actions should be controlled and audited by the public (e.g. through our representatives in Congress). I think that the biggest &quot;evil&quot; here are the members of Congress who either approved NSA actions or failed to do their job and monitor/audit NSA properly. In particular, I would point my finger at Sen. Dianne Feinstein [D-CA] who should have been ousted from the office long time ago.",1383721140

6681226,comment,6679678,6680804,4,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> In contrast, the more batteries Tesla produces the more the cost of lithium increases.<p>This is true, but misleading. The cost of lithium is a vanishingly small component of the price of the battery, a typical quote is between 1% and 0.1% of the production cost. Lithium is one of the most common elements in the earth&#x27;s crust, and is plentiful enough in seawater that it cannot run out -- before it&#x27;s cost is high enough to have any real effect in battery prices, it will be well worth extracting it from the seas. (In which there is enough supply for millions of years.)<p>The rapid increase in demand caused by proliferation of lithium-ion batteries has spiked the price over the past decade, but that is simply because mining operations take years to spin up, so large changes in demand always lead to large-scale price action. This has not yet had anything but a negligible effect on battery prices, and it will not have one in the future.<p>I do not understand the current meme of trying to paint all economic issues as resource-limited.

You can use the membership to track assignments.<p>big team - membership tracking - 1 card for many members - track the membership of a card while it is in your &quot;doing&quot; list. This way you can assign membership of a card in a &quot;staging&quot; list and then have any member drag a card to the &quot;doing&quot; list to track the team time. This way your Trello board becomes a real time view of who is assigned what and show if they are currently working on it.<p>Reportsfortrello.com will show all of the activity along the way. You can see the time spent by the: card, board, and member. You keep the simple interface in Trello and the ability to use the desktop, tab, iphone, android clients and still get detailed time tracking (for those that need to see it).<p>I really don&#x27;t think it gets any easier than dragging a card from one list to another.

I think the premise of an &quot;ideal capitalist product&quot; is either self-contradictory or ill-defined. The analysis of the digital panopticon, and its effect on interpersonal relationships is spot on.<p>I&#x27;ll summarize what you might see as HN antagonism in this piece as &quot;refinement of the current digital trends will only make worse appear better&quot;. If the digital utopia (another ill-defined term) refers to current-trend network panopticon, then I surely and emphatically agree.<p>But computers are faithful servants, nothing more. They are currently recapitulating existing hierarchies -- this is how We The Hackers have commandeered them. Who wants to write a distributed system when so much in our tool-belts makes client/server architectures a comparative breeze. It&#x27;s no surprise that on the first try we&#x27;ve made our servants into centralization machines, into pyramid builders.<p>The network effects -- for or against hierarchy -- of most (maybe all) previous tech is hard-wired. The steam engine&#x27;s effects, etched in steel, support hierarchy only to the point thermodynamics and Mr. Carnot will allow. Radio and television are inherently hierarchal, supporting one-way broadcast on account of the physical limits of electromagnetic transmission. There are a myriad other technologies, to be evaluated by these criteria, and I think Lewis Mumford has done a pretty thorough job of it [1].<p>As for our digital servants -- they aren&#x27;t hard-wired. Decentralization may be non-trivial today, but when it works, it persists as long as the medium. Bittorrent isn&#x27;t going away anytime soon, and DHTs are here to stay.<p>So by all means, leave the digital utopia you&#x27;ve been sold so far. Most popular fiction utopias were strictly controlled hierarchies anyway.
Let&#x27;s re-wire our servants to decentralize. We can fight the panopticon with the same silicon we used to build it.

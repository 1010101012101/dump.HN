5359203,comment,5353315,5358349,2,0,jules,,,"Here is the thing you're looking for. LEM is law of excluded middle, DN is double negation elimination law. Lets define some type abbreviations:<p><pre><code>    LEM = (x:Type) -> Either x (x -> _|_)
    DN = (x:Type) -> ((x -> _|_) -> _|_) -> x
</code></pre>
We first constructively prove not not LEM:<p><pre><code>    notnotLEMproof : (x:Type) -> ((LEM x) -> _|_) -> _|_
    notnotLEMproof x f = f (Right (\a -> f (Left a))

Now we can use double negation to obtain a proof for LEM:<p><pre><code>    DNimpliesLEM : DN -> LEM
    DNimpliesLEM dn x = dn (LEM x) (notnotLEMproof x)

I hope this is correct, since I don't know Idris syntax. If Idris supports implicit parameters, you would not need the x's:<p><pre><code>    notnotLEM f = f (Right (\a -> f (Left a))

The number of people who can do this well is probably very small -- take a few million words of ever-changing law, regulations, case law, etc. and convert it into code.<p>Yet it has been done.  Just look at tax return preparation software.  It's out there.  And it is, for the most part, shit.<p>I offer that judgment as a tax lawyer whose office prepares tax returns.  And who cleans up messes created by people using the software out there in the world.<p>Tax software alone is not the end to shoot for, however.  You need to bolt together a bank plus accounting software plus the tax software.  If you have a fashion-forward bank that will host a better Quickbooks (not just ""oh, yeah, my bank talks to your software"" -- make it F-ing work), then have that accounting data speak directly to the tax software -- this is a winner.  For extra added bonus points, this system collects all of the documentation required by the IRS on audit.<p>For the bulk of people out there, tax and accounting is a schlep problem and not a brain damaging intellectual exercise.  And if you solve 80% of the problems leaving 20% for the owner/accountant to solve, you've saved a ton of time and money.<p>I have been cobbling together a system for nonresident consulting types to do business in the USA:  a corporation, how to sign the contracts with consulting clients, how to allocate the income to taxable in the USA vs. not taxable in the USA, how to pay the employees/consultants properly in the USA, what paperwork to file, etc. etc.  But it has humans where software would be useful.  That's because of one key constraint.<p>The biggest problem is that people don't want to do the schlep work -- not even download data from the credit card or bank sites into their software.

Most long-term homeowners in expensive areas of California do, in fact, own at least one extremely valuable asset, which makes them wealthy.

So for instance, someone walking down the street and slipping on a banana isn't funny, but if the person was walking with great dignity/purpose/ostentation, some sort of VIP, then it's funny. Because their perception of reality and their opinion of themselves is at odds with their swift fall from grace.<p>I think this might be right. When I make people laugh it's usually by giving the impression that I fundamentally misunderstand some fact of reality (or that I perceive myself differently to others).<p>When we physically laugh it's like a short circuit of one perception of reality breaking through from another.",1363031263

Company formation seems like a great first candidate. Most of what lawyers do is thoroughly routine.<p>Nobody is arguing that startups like Clerky are going to put lawyers out of business. They're just taking something you don't need bespoke counsel for and making it simple to do.<p>The fact is, you're likely to end up in a better state having used Clerky than you are if you try to find your own lawyers and get them to do something customized. A huge number of lawyers suck at this. Different people specialize in different things, and the ones who specialize in company formation are just as likely to be expert in e.g. capitalizing and running a local restaurant as they are in setting up vesting schedules for a tech startup.",1363030565

That makes reading longer text much more pleasant.<p>Firefox is also capable of handling large amounts of tabs.  In Chrome the tab bar is of fixed length (length of the window) and thus the maximum number of tabs is limited by my screen width.  In Firefox the tab bar can extend to the sides or even better you can use the TreeStyleTabs addon to organize tabs in a tree view.<p>I think the biggest problem for Firefox was the long wait before FF4 was released.  That was the exact time many people moved to Chrome.  FF3.6 wasn't bad but was clearly slower than Chrome and had a huge memory appetite.

I currently have modern mix running on my windows 8 desktop. By and large, I've found that the vast majority of the time I'm on a desktop computer, I'm in the desktop mode of win8. Rarely do I find that the metro apps are useful outside of the mobile/tablet/laptop space. Despite all this, I thought ""cool this product looks neat"" and purchased a license to Modern Mix. Overall I haven't really found it tremendously useful. Whereas before I'd pin my calendar to the side of my screen (one of the very few metro apps I used on my desktop), I now just have it sitting in a window. The mix of win8 window borders with the metro styled apps just makes them look awkward, and I really don't feel like I've been given more functionality despite the increased flexibility. 
The one nice feature is you can run multiple metro apps in fullscreen - which is great if you have a large multimonitor setup and if you have a bunch of metro based apps in your workflow. But by and large it's that last requirement that really doesn't make this product worth it for me - I simply don't have a large amount of metro apps I want to use. Are they nice on a tablet? Sure.

Based on that list, MIKE AND IKE, HOT TAMALES, ZOURS, TEENEE BEANEE Jelly Beans and JUST BORN Jelly Beans are gluten, soy, and milk free. I know that Mike&Ike had a big PR campaign a year or two back, aimed at teens. Don't know how it turned out though.<p>You eat junk food while at work, so it's not like you're against junk food per se. Perhaps there's something that you and your son can enjoy together? In moderation, of course.",1363028510

It would probably be worth a fair amount...certainly a few thousand at least. Facebook are normally pretty happy for you to disclose after they fix it, so you can still get the PR...",1363028501

But if you're happy with playmoney, nothing stops you from, say, just writing down predictions and checking how they ultimately do.

Moreover, a lot of public forums based on user-generated content automatically annotate their links so they don't contribute to page rank either; this is done for sensible reasons to prevent blatant spamming, but does mean that a lot of legitimate positive links also don't count. This combination undermines the entire idea that a page rank based on the quality and quantity of incoming links <i>that Google can see and will count</i> is a good indicator of the value of a site.<p>In other news, searching for things on Google increasingly seems to turn up large, commercial sites first and only to reach smaller, more personal, and often more informative/less biased sites several pages down.

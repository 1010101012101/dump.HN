The idea of a stateless, functional, package management system is really important in places like scientific computing, where we have many pieces of software, relatively little funding to improve the quality of the software, and still need to ensure that all components can be built and easily swapped for each other.<p>The HashDist developers (still in early beta: <a href=""https://github.com/hashdist/hashdist"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hashdist/hashdist</a> ) inherited a few ideas from Nix, including the idea of prefix builds.  The thing about HashDist is that you can actually install it in userspace over any UNIXy system (for now, Cygwin, OS X, and Linux), and get the exact software configuration that somebody else was using across a different architecture.",1394542774

Peeling the surface layers off of EHR systems, it seems they are essentially big ERP systems with a medical bent.  So they require multitudes of system-building consultants, nine figure purchase prices, and a bigger focus on making sure billing/procedure auditing can be done by administrators than facilitating MD/patient dataflow.<p>FTA:  &quot;why wasn’t the EHR already doing the legwork, displaying these potentially pertinent correlations and data points, painting a more descriptive clinical picture, instead of leaving me to wade through mounds of information?&quot;<p>Because the focus of the EHR system is about billing and tracking medical record treatment for hospital administrators (auditing) rather than enhancing clinical treatment and understanding for MDs?<p>Probably a large opportunity here to do cool and better GUI and visualization, but good luck getting past the EHR vendor guard dogs to even read-only access the back-end data.",1394542704

Agile/Scrum is often just window dressing. If you have a good team then it will give you some nice things like frequent interim releases and a better idea of progress.

The text fits itself into my browser that&#x27;s sized to half my laptop width, and when I make it fullsize it&#x27;s still readable because the developer has applied a minimal amount of taste and prevented the text from blindly reflowing to an equally unreadable full width.

To me it feels like the morally better of the two — at least you are contributing some money towards the shows you like to watch, even if not through the proper channels.<p>I would also argue that Netflix could likely make it harder to circumvent their access controls, but it is probably not in their interest to do so. If it were up to Netflix, I suspect it would be available globally — Netflix only has to enforce the minimum required geoblocking to satisfy the rights holders. If some people get around this, all it means is more business and more mind share for Netflix. (And arguably more business for the rights holders.)",1394540650

But I am not sure about where to start from (eg: study history or focus on sciences?).<p>Another motivation is discussion&#x27;s sake: Which fields do you consider important for one to have a solid knowledge at?

There are browser extensions and GreaseMonkey scripts for me to add feeds to Google Reader.<p>I'd be more concerned that RSS is dying because many content providers--from big media to bloggers--seem to prefer to only show me a short excerpt, or even a title in their RSS feeds.  I don't want to leave Google Reader to read your articles!  When I have to open every single RSS item's link (in a new tab) from Reader, that either discourages me from visiting your site... or discourages me from using RSS, as it adds little to no value, and indeed just introduces frustration.<p>The other reason I avoid RSS is for sites like HN and Reddit, where the order of links, their scores, and their ages are important.  Maybe RSS should be updatable (which may be what PubSubHubbub is designed for?).",1293994799

There needs to be some sort of semantic interpretation of how important something is other than h1’s. How do we replicate the 144pt super-important headings while removing presentation from content?<p>The web was built for rationalist minds and papers, and the separation of html elements furthers this goal, yet hampers any sort of human-ness of communication.<p>RSS is great for a blog, but bad for newspapers. Check out NYT’s RSS feed. Every article ticks in at an equal level of importance and requires the viewer’s mental acuity to discern what’s #1. Not so with their web-front or printed sheet.<p>Syndication, while essential, needs to be extended.",1293994756

2060688,comment,2060541,2060541,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Honestly I have no idea what kind of business it would make. It may take off, it may not.<p>IMO though I wouldn't be inclined to use it. First, if I buy something nice, new, or expensive and I want my friends to know about it, I will either put it on Facebook or tell them over the phone or in person. I know everyone I friend on Facebook personally, I have met all of them in person and talk to them at least once a month on average in some setting either via Facebook, email, in person, or on the phone. With that in mind though, of the over 500+ friends I have there, I would only share a purchase with maybe 20-30 of them at most depending on the purchase. I have lists setup on Facebook for all my friends, broken down into groups such as College, Work, Family, etc... From there when I post things to my wall I direct those posts only to those lists, meaning that others can't see the post. So I can control who sees what and knows what about things I do at a very granular level. Even though the average person probably doesn't have this level of granularity setup on Facebook, the thought process behind sharing is probably the same to some extent.<p>As for competition, I think there are several avenues you may not have considered. First, social shopping sites are starting to popup everywhere. Fancy (<a href=""http://www.thefancy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefancy.com</a>) is one that I can think of off the top of my head. There is also a site that lets women, and I think men, rate each others clothing choice.<p>Now, I will say that the concept of social shopping is powerful and if you can tap into the market with something unique and powerful you may have your hands on something. I for one know that I usually look to friends when deciding on a major purchase. If you could somehow incorporate a deals functionality, maybe like a Groupon into it, where if you can convince a bunch of friends to buy something you work out a discount with the store, that could potentially take off.",1293994346

Clicking an RSS button shows you the same thing you just looked at, except without the site design and only partial content (Safari). Currently, in Chrome, I just see a dense block of text.<p>RSS is an amazing tool, but maybe we just haven't found the right UI for it yet. Exposing it in the browser doesn't work very well and treating RSS as an Inbox (like Google Reader) where every item needs to be marked as read is too overwhelming.

2060684,story,,,14,23,Rust,"Ideas Without Time/Money - How Can I Make Them Happen?",,"I have a few ideas that I think are potentially very good ones (i.e. currently uncommon, lucrative in the right market, socially engaging, etc.) but lack the time and money to really get any further than basic planning and peer discussion.<p>Or I'll start and then my wife gets angry that I spend so much time in front of the computer outside of my day-job (also in front of a computer), and I end up having to leave it half-done or less. This has happened a couple of times - sorry, if you were one of the users. It's on my list and I will get another release out.<p>I would like to see these ideas done up while still retaining some limited say in their implementation and management, but again the lack of capital makes actual hiring impossible.<p>The question is, should I just give up on these and release them into the wild and hope for the best? Should I take a stand, find some (so far unavailable) financing and hire a couple of people to work with me on them (and leave the day job and hope I can still pay my rent)? Should I leverage (or develop - same risk as above though) a crowd-sourced development system (GitHub, etc.) and find a way to equitably split any income with contributors? Should I move to a more tech-centric area with more educated investors? Find a risk-taking dev and start hitting the incubators (although my wife will probably not like that idea)?<p>I am open to all suggestions at this point. I would prefer to be a part of whatever develops, but I also have a strong desire to see at least a few of these actually happen no matter what.<p>None of them are small ideas (from a man-hours perspective), but I think a pair of good web devs and a designer could probably bang each of them out in 3 to 6 weeks. Except the one which is probably a good 4 to 6 months.<p>Thanks in advance, HN!",1293994212
2060683,comment,2060329,2060329,0,0,jerf,,,"That doesn't counter his point at all. The difference between ""obesity"" and ""maintaining weight"" is still implausibly thin; what Gary was talking about in the first place was the delta in the top two lines, not the net total. He mentions that more obese people eventually do reach an energy balance, which obviously happens because they income and outflow eventually balance, which is a sign that he understands that. (Sixth paragraph, starts with ""First, obese people tend to be weight stable for long periods of their life"".) You didn't disprove his argument, you just reiterated bits of it, only with less comprehension and a math simulation disconnected from what actually happens (your simulation lacks the relative stability that people reach and simulates the clearly false scenario in which people become fatter without bound). (""relative stability"" - there is a long-term weight gain over pretty much everybody's life but when people become obese they can do so much more rapidly than ~1lb/year)<p>(Personally I'd break it down to the individual meals since that's where satiety occurs and now we're talking about a delta of 3 or 4 calories. It's an absurd argument. Nothing is that precise without a feedback loop. And if a feedback loop is involved, the idea that the feedback loop is what is broken is hardly that odd an idea.)<p>I'm seeing a lot more people declare that Taubes is wrong or obviously a crank that there are people actually demonstrating a comprehension of his points, which I tend to consider a prerequisite for an actually-effective ""debunking"". Maybe he's wrong, but it's not because of people arguing against points he's not even making while blatently missing the ones he is.",1293994100

You then switched to saying Gruber and Arment are always right. I then asked you the definition of right you and me can accept. You did not give one explicitly but it sounded like your definition of right was ""whatever Apple does and whatever I perceive"" - just like Gruber and Arment. Which to me isn't objective. So I did the next logical thing - agreed that you agree to your convictions about Apple.<p>It's hard to argue with people who <i>invariably</i> talk only positively and mostly subjectively (it just 'feels' right) about even somewhat complex subjects which require actually defining things, having a lack of bias and use of analytical skills.<p>For the Apple camp - the simplistic rule is ""What Apple does is right - if what they do changes, so does what is right"". So for example when Apple gets market share - market share is the king and when they start losing it, suddenly that is no longer worth discussing - profits are. Shifting goal posts. You don't hear the Apple fans complain about anything Apple - the ridiculous positioning of USB ports on MBP for e.g. - for a company and its fans that pride themselves with superior usability - this apparently is no problem at all. That's biased and you can't really argue with biased people other than to say - ok, to you your own.<p>That is not to say Apple hasn't done great things - but it is also non-sensical to say everything they have done is right and everything anyone else is doing and will do in future will end up being crap - that's essentially what Arment says in that post.

I am a masters student in computer science. Last semester(fall 2010), I took a semester break and came back to India(my native country) because I was not really interested in continuing my masters degree. I don't really think it fits me and my goal.<p>I am working on my own website and testing it as of now. I really want to continue doing that. So, I was just thinking if I could work on my own website and do freelancing part-time to support myself. Is it possible to get around $800 - 1000/month doing freelancing.<p>I really love developing Ruby on Rails applications. I have developed applications using ROR, PrototypeJS, jQuery. This is not an advertisement for my freelancing, just an genuine doubt since I believe, many of you reading this would have gone through something like this and would like to know your thoughts.",1293991397

These functions should be available on any C language implementation regardless of the platform (Unix/POSIX, Windows, embedded RTOS, micro-controller with no OS, etc.).<p>The POSIX API is a platform specification for Unix like platforms (though the API is sometimes available non-natively on non-Unix like platforms).  It is comparable to the win32 API on windows.  It has no particular connection to the C language other than that C is the language in which the API is provided.<p>Perhaps one reason for this confusion is that today many people are familiar with higher level programming environments like Java or Python which provide much richer standard libraries than do C and C++.  They include things like multithreading and network communications.  C programmers need to use platform specific API's like POSIX or win32 to access these services.  Also note that pretty much any higher level language running on a modern OS is ultimately using the platform system API's to provide such services because the OS kernel doesn't allow user space programs access to them other than through a system call mechanism (which the platform API's typically wrap).<p>One other possible source of confusion that the post doesn't mention is that on Unix the library one links to for both the C standard library functions and the Unix/POSIX system API's is called libc (it's usually called glibc on Linux).  Despite the name this is not the same thing as the C standard library.",1293991261

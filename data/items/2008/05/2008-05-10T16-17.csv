This advice has been from my own experiences and that of others, many of whom have failed as well as succeeded, but is contrary to what some consultant friends are saying.<p>I am not an <i>expert</i> in building large scale web apps by any means, but have worked on enough to know good practice/paths from bad, atleast at the early stages.<p>They do have software dev experience themselves (e.g. CEO, who is doing PhD at Oxford, has ~2yrs commercial software exp in electronics company) and have done some research into those areas (the MBA guy did most of it).<p>Anyway Sumon I will try and get them to attend the talk on Tuesday and ask you/panel questions during the Q&A as I am sure talking to more people who are <i>doing</i> this will help them no end.",1210438467

If the disk you are backing up to  is compatible with the broken disk, you 1) already have a disk to put in your computer, and 2) you can already boot off it. So the time wasted is the absolute minimum.<p>Even for people using rdiff, it's probably best to have a ready-to-go backup as described in the article. His recommendation of having a bootable backup is still valid, and is not limited to the ""My house just burned down"" case. That's what the <i>third</i> disk is for :-)",1210437291

The vast majority of startups never have that problem. Start out with something capable of handling the traffic from a Techcrunch article (maybe one or two visitors per second for a few hours). Spend a couple of hours thinking about how you would scale up and have a plan, but no more than that. Scalability can be very expensive so investing on it without knowing that you will need it is a case of premature optimization.",1210436506

The fact is, all their VC links and grand plans will come to nothing at all unless they have execution ability. And they have no execution ability until they have a technology director - the kind whose back you can build a company on. Those are rare enough. The technology of choice or even the level of experience should be of no consequence. They need a 1 or 2 in this taxonomy:

Knowing what pages are popular, where the users come from and what acquisition channels can you use and at what costs in order to bring eye-balls to your content influence directly what content area is going to be invested into and expanded by the content providers, which makes them do exactly what <i>the user wants</i>.<p>In a world without analytics you have tons of crappy content written or created at the whip of an executive who thinks she's good at guessing market demand (and nobody in the company can prove her wrong scientifically speaking before the job is done).

2643493,comment,2642486,2642486,1,0,Groxx,,,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there a relatively-easy solution to this?<p>Store everything in a versioned, secure-hashed repository.  Git is too complex, just checksum everything and store it along with the code (this repository is created by the rest of this paragraph).  Hand-build a minimal, trivially-human-readable (thus trustable by those who are interested) compiler to compile the first commit.  Compile SHA.  Get a secure hash of the binary.  Store it.<p>Read the next commit.  Verify there is no ""compile('bug 1')"" in that step.  Compile it with v1, and store the hash.  Continue.<p>You now have a chain of trust established, starting with something you can read easily, and building minimally at each step (just read the diffs).  And you've got the signature of the trusted compiler at any stage.  Now check the signature of the downloaded compiler against your known-trusted signature.  Compile, secure in the knowledge you have no infected compiler - an infected one wouldn't match the signature of the compiler you could create from your most-recent trusted result.<p>This is extendable with digital signatures, the algorithms of which can be understood with a little number theory, and the code shortly thereafter.  Choose who you trust, and spread the work out, just like every other trust-based system.  Or trust nobody, and do it yourself (edit: yes, this implies you must build your own computer from tools you develop independently).<p>We've now arrived at the problems around trusting other humans, which are unsolvable.  The fact of which must be accepted to varying degrees, or rejected entirely, which requires you to live in isolation.  Since you're reading this, you're not in isolation, so you accept some level of human trust, so the previously-established chain of trust would solve the issue for you if the ones you trusted had approved the chain you're using.<p>In this setup, all you'd need to trust is others who fill the gaps you don't directly approve yourself (note that this includes the security / validity of the hash algorithm).  Which is the best you can do without omniscience, which would solve the trust issue on its own anyway.",1307781980

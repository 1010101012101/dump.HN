If that doesn't work, block his entire ISP with a message that they have this guy to thank for it.  Finally, ignore him.  If he makes a comment, delete it.  Don't respond.  From what I've seen, you seem to be feeding into his pathology.  This isn't a blame the victim thing, but an Internet thing.  The guy's a troll and every time you answer him, you reinforce his behavior.",1205103401

Hire for ""smart, gets things done"". What the hell else is there to it?<p>37Signals has a 4-day work week. Calacanis optimizes for maximim work-hours per week (hoping, for instance, that buying home computers will keep people working 1-2 hours extra at home, and buying ridiculous coffee machines to ""capture"" the 20 minutes people spend at Starbucks).<p>Who gets more done? Between Calacanis' company and 37Signals? Is this a joke? Has anyone here given a dollar to Calacanis?",1205103317

When a user upvote a story, isn't he saying ""Thanks for sharing this with the community.I want more people to see this"" rather than ""i agree with the content of this article""?<p>Karma encourages users to participate in the sharing activity.Its purpose is not to thank the content creator, but the person who took time to share it.<p>[Vote â‰  Karma]",1205102425

I'm depressed when I'm <i>not</i> working.<p>It's a totally false analogy. I code and break software for a living. I have a blast. Modafinil and aderrol sound like a blast, too. But 20 years from now, I expect to look back fondly on 80 hour work weeks, the way I look back on 2-hour-of-sleep nights with newborns. Unlike the drugs, those weeks won't have scorched my neurochemical pathways.<p>You talk as if you have some way of measuring the risk of these drugs, or as if the risk was fantastical.

The thing is, I keep stumbling into people and books who swear by it and sing all sorts of praises. I'm interested, does it not suit certain types of people or am I missing something here? Do you guys find it to be useful and if so would you mind sharing how?

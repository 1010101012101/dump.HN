Obviously it would require some writing of code, but it seems like it would be a good cause that a lot of people could get behind, including organizations that have coders and/or money.

He had however spent 20+ years doing concept and character design, sculpting, stop motion animation and model building.  It took him about 8 weeks to become proficient enough at Maya to start turning out character models that outshone most of the others (admittedly at a much slower pace).

And the bottom poor in America are doing better than the ""middle class"" in Zimbabwe or some other third world country. But the real point of these type of graphs is that return on PRODUCTIVITY has skewed exponentially toward the wealthy. It's evidence that supply side economics does not work. THERE IS NO TRICKLE DOWN lol. The rich just get richer while inflation and stagnant wages make the poor get poorer. This is not political rhetoric or demonization of the wealthy. It's simply reality and can be substantiated with data and numbers.<p>People also need to stop with this logical fallacy about the wealthy working hard for their wealth. Typically that's not how it works , wealthy people typically increase their wealth exponentially by NOT working hard...instead choosing to use this little thing called....the stock market. The whole point of the stock market is to make your money work for you...and get more of it. That little 15K you've slaved to get into your 401K, yea someone makes that in a week....off of dividends lol. Even CEOs who make hundreds of millions of dollars do not work in the traditional sense. They get paid to make decisions, and often times those decisions are out right HORRIBLE affecting the lives of the middle class and poor who work under them(if they don't get laid off).

So, I'll share my two cents.<p>I'm from a modest background in the Midwest.  My first tech job was in Seattle (better than SV, but still not ""cheap"").  I then lived in Beijing, Boston, and Manila before coming to SV.  I spent 1 year in Palo Alto, and now 2 years in San Francisco.<p>I was originally VERY against it.  My wife basically dragged me here kicking and screaming.  I've always thought of Silicon Valley as this giant bug zapper, where people are lured in by the promise of extreme success, and then get zapped by a culture of 95% failure at startups.<p>Now I'm a huge fan.  Here are the main two reasons:<p>1) First, a mitigating factor.  The salaries are actually pretty well adjusted for cost of living.  You're getting a fair deal compared to other tech cities.  Market forces are doing just fine.<p>2) The number of people in tech here is simply unparalleled.  Head and shoulders better than any other city on the planet.  That might not seem important, but it is surprisingly powerful.  You have access to a huge network of people.  Whether you're trying to get a job at big co, or doing a startup, access to a network of people turns out to be a significant contributor to success.<p>PG's essay on SV is spot on.  I scoffed when I first read it, but he is right. (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html</a>)<p>The main problems as mentioned by the original article:<p>1) Homelessness  IMO, this is due to lack of proper institutions for mental illness and substance abuse, not housing.  SF is a ridiculously liberal city, and there is plenty of low income housing.<p>2) Real estate prices  If you are buying a home today, it is very painful.  However, due to CA's limited growth property taxes, it is quite affordable for the majority of residents who have been living here for life.  That results in a clever form of progressive taxation.",1363012024

5356878,comment,5356492,5356492,2,0,joonix,,,"There's a great irony in the liberal/conservative (left and right) dichotomy. On the one hand, you have left-leaning people who build their platform on the premise that they are champions for the poor and lower/middle classes and multiculturalism, while the right-wing is perceived as only looking out for the wealthy white people.<p>And yet, I can't help but compare one left-wing enclave to a right-wing one.<p>The Bay Area always shocked me as to how segregated it is, with whites and upper class people living in their suburbs with almost all blacks living in Oakland and the lower-income whites living in suburbs that are oppressively distant from job-centers. And the Bay Area has a housing affordability crisis, while at the same time being surrounded by plenty of land and low-density building that could be built-out to increasing the housing supply and thus affordability. But, this doesn't happen because the local incumbent populations are extreme NIMBYs.<p>NYC deserves a mention, too, because while they are limited on space on which to build, there's still lots of low-rise stock that can be replaced with much denser development, but gets blocked due to NIMBYs and historical protections. I can sympathize with wanting to preserve the historic aesthetic, but we could at least find a few locations to build a massive development to disrupt the housing supply and bring down prices.<p>I compare these with the so-called right-wing bastion I grew up in, Houston, TX. In Houston, whites and blacks live in close proximity, they shop at the same stores and malls, they actually interact in daily life. Wealthy neighborhoods are directly across from lower-income neighborhoods. More importantly, housing is affordable. There are almost no restrictions on the housing market: you can tear down and build almost anywhere. Middle class families can afford to buy houses.<p>I'm not arguing for one philosophy or the other; nor am I saying I'd rather live in one place or the other (I'd live in the Bay if I made $200k, I'd live in TX if I made $50k), I'm only pointing out the irony and that a lot of these political diehards are full of crap.<p>There are simple solutions to the affordability crisis in SV and SF, but NIMBYs and protectionists would rather see the poor suffer rather than risk a decline in their property values.",1363011989

5356874,comment,5356492,5356492,2,0,sologoub,,,"Homelessness is an extremely complex issue. As is poverty. This article seems more sensationalist than anything. They lumped several issues together here to create content that sells.<p>Three key issues raised: homelessness, racial inequality (referring to Hispanic wages), and general income distribution inequality.<p>General income inequality and the racial flavor touched are likely related to several factors, such as education/line of work and workforce mobility. While you can ensure that people have better jobs through education/training programs, combined with job placements (both extremely non-trivial), people from poor areas will always gravitate to wealthier areas. This has nothing to do with racial/ancestral traits or anything other than people seeking employment in the wealthier areas that are more likely to provide employment opportunities. So, effectively, no matter how good your programs are, you will always have some group that needs help. This is why it's important to focus on a long term, sustainable approach to education and training. There is no silver bullet here, unless you can magically impart that knowledge on every living human.<p>Homelessness is a completely different can of worms. If you have ever worked with long term homeless you will know that only some actually want to return to ""normal"" life. I put the word normal in quotes because the perception of what normal shifts. In a conversation that stuck in my mind, one person I spoke to referred to how I live as slavery to money/worldly possessions. I'm sure this is not the sentiment shared by the majority, but it illustrates the complexity of the issue. If we truly pride ourselves in having a free society, we then cannot force a certain way of life on people. What we can and should do is offer support and a way back if people so choose.<p>Personally, I'd like to see us provide more incentives to wealthy individuals and corporations in supporting educational and other programs to help. An extra tax benefit for keeping the money in US and a solid dose of public support and encouragement. Somehow as a society we love stories of billionaires donating money for causes in Africa or another impoverished place. This public opinion is a strong incentive. If it shifts toward more support at home, the money will follow.",1363011962

Keep in mind that the industry didn't die... there are more cars now than ever. It just shifted in such a way as to unseat Detroit as the Silicon Valley of the automobile revolution.<p>Of course Detroit had other problems: race relations, corruption, etc. But those are problems that can be dealt with if a region has a good economic base. If it would have kept its Silicon Valley of the auto crown, I don't think they would have been big issues.<p>(Edit: Nowadays, Detroit is actually a potentially attractive contrarian place to go. Start here: <a href=""http://omnicorpdetroit.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omnicorpdetroit.com/blog/</a> )<p>When this happened, wages collapsed. When that happened, the leveraged real estate pyramid fell. When that happened, tax bases collapsed, infrastructure collapsed, crime soared, and everyone left. Kaboom.<p>This scenario could definitely happen to The Valley. Another scenario that could lead to a slower decline would be if SV completely priced out everyone but CXO-level people. This would transform it into a closed circle-jerk of high-ego CXO types, all of whom would be convinced (as such personality types generally are) that they've got everything all figured out. The Valley would become like a giant IBM-in-the-70s or Microsoft-in-the-90s, and the market would eventually leave it behind.",1363011682

It's also true that having a gun in the house is additional, sometimes tragic, risk with no benefit to children.<p>Except for the cases in which a gun in the home is used for self defense.<p>> First, as a parent you're supposed to put the benefit of your child over the little joys in your life, like squeezing a trigger of a 44 Magnum or getting enough sleep.<p>And swimming, because apparently they're more likely to die doing that.<p>> Second, you can enjoy most of the benefits of having a gun without actually having one in the house.<p>Except for self defense, which if we read the Constitution is the primary reason for the second amendment (discussion about self defense from <i>whom</i> aside for the moment).<p>> I'm pretty sure you cannot hunt or discharge firearms within city limits anyway.<p>I don't know what city limits have to do with anything, so I don't think this is germane. I'm willing to bet you're more likely to find a pool in the suburbs than downtown, anyway.<p>But living in a city does not mean you waive your right to self defense.<p>> You can still indulge yourself in hunting or go to a shooting range without endangering the life of your child by having a gun in your house.<p>You can still indulge yourself in swimming or go to a public pool without endangering the life of your child by having a pool in your yard.",1363011608

It's only $900-1000 if you want to live the urban lifestyle in Yaletown or the West End. For bedrooms in suburbia the proportional rent (i.e., per bedroom) is lower. Which is to say, the run-up in Vancouver rent (what little there has been) has mainly impacted those who can afford it most (read: those without children).<p>Median family income in San Francisco is a ""laughable"" $72K, while studios run north of $2500 and one bedrooms bust the $3000 per month ceiling. <i>That</i> is a wealth gap. The demographics in that city have become ""tech workers"" and ""everyone else"", with even basic subsistence in the city becoming untenable for many who have been there for decades.

In the long run you'll be <i>far</i> better off learning and cultivating rock solid CS fundamentals rather than just hopping from one framework to the next hoping to glean a little more from each. Having an in-depth understanding of the types of data structures and algorithms that go into developing $new_hotness will allow you to pick up different languages/frameworks/etc significantly faster than just learning $new_hotness on the surface level.<p>Take parametric polymorphism [1] as a random example; i.e. what's called generics in Java, templates in C++, etc. You might know how to use it in a particular language and realize it provides some benefit. But if you truly understand the underlying concept then you can quickly recognize it and/or know to look for it in any language you pick up, whether it's Java, OCaml, Visual Prolog, etc. Note each of those languages are in three totally separate paradigms (object oriented, functional, & logic) and yet all of them still make use of the same underlying idea to achieve a particular goal (in this case, a form of type-safe expressivity). If you have a good understanding of $random_fundamental_concept then all you would need is to take a couple minutes to learn its syntax in your new language of choice and be on your way. I chose that example because it was the first that popped into my head, but in reality it goes for just about anything.<p>In short, with a good understanding of the fundamentals, you can make the time it takes to learn something new that will invariably be based on them significantly shorter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism</a>",1363010419

1667391,comment,1666445,1666586,0,0,gills,,,"I think that formal methods do matter, and can be realistic.  We have a culture problem, perhaps inherent to the ease with which programs of unknown correctness may be written and executed, that usually we <i>just don't care.</i>  How familiar is this cycle?  iterate{think => type => execute => check}?  Being rushed into the ""protoduction"" dev model doesn't help a lot either.<p>I had a professor who was apparently a student of E.W. Djikstra, and many of the points in this essay were essential to his courses.  For example, exam questions weren't just ""write code to do X"", but ""write code to do X and <i>prove it</i>"", with failure to prove it resulting in a big fat 0.  Of course, we were required to use weakest-precondition verification, from the bottom to the top.  Not as tedious as it sounds, once you've gone through it once or twice, and I think the point wasn't to teach something we would use day-to-day, but to teach us that verifying programs by hand was not only possible but tractable.  It seems like the TDD movement kind of makes the same point, though perhaps less formally.<p>Another professor introduced a variant of this technique developed for verifying the critical points of parallel and multi-threaded computation, which while far more tedious has been vastly more useful in my career as a model for thinking about concurrent programs [not bulletproof, of course, because runtimes and hardware sometimes do unexpected but perfectly valid things with our programs].<p>Most algorithms, at their core, have formal descriptions short enough to prove by hand in a matter of minutes.  For those parts, I think it's realistic to use formal methods.  All the other cruft we tack on to our programs to make then flexible, perform in a variety of contexts, handle varying data types, error checking, etc.; I think those fall in the realm of what you describe as ""realistic programs"", and which amounts to a daunting heap of code to verify by hand.  Luckily, we can again follow his advice and use computation as an alternative, and verify by hand a program which can verify some or most of our work for us -- that seems to be what a lot of static analysis is all about.<p>I don't know.  Do you ever run into situations day to day where you find yourself verifying your code by hand?  That's usually what happens when I get deep into finding an error.",1283806015

But that wouldn't actually help getting programs correct. For example if your error correcting program was to write every program three times, then if one of the three programs gives a different answer you use the answer of the other two. Now a human writing a program would probably just write the same bug in each of the three versions, i.e. the three versions are not independent. You could have the three versions written by three different humans. But that doesn't solve the problem either because some errors are just likely to be made by all three of them (for example forgetting to check some edge condition somewhere). So again the three versions are correlated. Or worse the problem could be in the specification all three of them got. I don't think there is any way out of this.",1283805552

But Steve had a real passion for industrial design, and he never seriously considered following Jef's recommendations.<p>As well as complete and utter disagreement with what was apparently written by Raskin, behold from ZeroGravitas's link:<p>> The elimination of slots had been dictated by Jobs, however I thought this would hamstring the product. Thus I invented the all-important bus diagnostic port discussed below<p>Whereas on folklore.org:<p>> But Jef Raskin had a very different point of view. He thought that slots were inherently complex, and were one of the obstacles holding back personal computers from reaching a wider audience. He thought that hardware expandability made it more difficult for third party software writers since they couldn't rely on the consistency of the underlying hardware. His Macintosh vision had Apple cranking out millions of identical, easy to use, low cost appliance computers and since hardware expandability would add significant cost and complexity it was therefore avoided.<p>> Apple's other co-founder, Steve Jobs, didn't agree with Jef about many things, but they both felt the same way about hardware expandability: it was a bug instead of a feature. Steve was reportedly against having slots in the Apple II back in the days of yore, and felt even stronger about slots for the Mac. He decreed that the Macintosh would remain perpetually bereft of slots, enclosed in a tightly sealed case, with only the limited expandability of the two serial ports.<p>> Mac hardware designer Burrell Smith and his assistant Brian Howard understood Steve's rationale, but they felt differently about the proper course of action. Burrell had already watched the Macintosh's hopelessly optimistic schedule start to slip indefinitely, and he was unable to predict when the Mac's pioneering software would be finished, if ever. He was afraid that Moore's Law would make his delayed hardware obsolete before it ever came to market. He thought it was prudent to build in as much flexibility as possible, as long as it didn't cost too much.<p>> Burrell decided to add a single, simple slot to his Macintosh design, which made the processor's bus accessible to peripherals, that wouldn't cost very much, especially if it wasn't used. He worked out the details and proposed it at the weekly staff meeting, but Steve immediately nixed his proposal, stating that there was no way that the Mac would even have a single slot.",1283804220

A defense contractor is not going to its competitors in order to reveal and exchange know-how. That know-how is a trade secret that gives them competitive advantage. Except that in this case, lack of sharing results in making the same mistake multiple times, which results in loss of human life.<p>Interestingly lately I have observed that the government is trying to tighten up its defense spending belt and there is a tendency to develop more in-house rather than contract out. In order to gain public support the Congress keeps voting to increase the salary of service personnel. That leaves less money to spend on contracting out. So perhaps we'll see more sharing in the future at least between  DoD's own projects.",1283804158

Only the stupid and malevolent will resist once certain simple truths are put to them. Those who resist must be persuaded; if they cannot be persuaded, laws must be passed to restrain them; if that does not work, then coercion, if need be violence, will inevitably have to be used—if necessary, terror, slaughter. Lenin believed this after reading Das Kapital, and consistently taught that if a just, peaceful, happy, free, virtuous society could be created by the means he advocated, then the end justified any methods that needed to be used, literally any.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/oct/23/message-21st-century/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/oct/23/message...</a>",1430297744

Cars will live on for many years but as self-driving cars come into play, owning a car wont be a need any more.

9457064,comment,9454440,9456886,0,0,ddingus,,,"No worries.<p>There are a few things.  Honestly, I see the text in the input box here, and a sentence appears multi-line, and that will corrupt my perception of how it will appear.  That is one basic cause.<p>Edit:  HN should just A/B test this.  Make it much wider and see what happens.  I know my response will be more robust paragraphs.  But what of others?<p>Another is conversational writing modes are more relaxed generally, though not always.  So I care a lot less, often thinking in dialog, writing same, rather than composing in a more structured way.  There is a time balance component too.  If I&#x27;m to participate in some dialogs where I think it makes sense, I manage that investment.<p>I participate in a variety of venues.  If you go back through my threads here, you will find some info on advocacy, and a big part of that is how one&#x27;s text will flow to readers.<p>(and this varies a lot!)<p>Clearly, readers here are more sophisticated, and I see a range of styles, and in general, more paragraphs and more appropriate paragraphs.  Fair enough to question my content on that basis.  I agree with you.<p>But, that&#x27;s not often the norm.<p>Over time, I&#x27;ve entertained some meta dialog of this kind, and have found breaking things up helps for a lot of people.  There is a difference between, say an article, or structured piece, and dialog / sharing kinds of writing.<p>On narrow devices, mobile, smaller browser windows, etc... it actually does make sense to be a lot more liberal with paragraphs, and I do.  I very frequently am using such a device myself.  So there is that.  Where I&#x27;ve got a keyboard, I find myself more in line with more traditional expectations.<p>Finally, line breaks sometimes are good for emphasis, and that&#x27;s my own style.  It&#x27;s not always liked.  And that&#x27;s OK with me.  There are some times when I&#x27;ve had to compose a complex sentence, with some logic, if, and, or, either...  and the phrases between contain enough words to warrant line breaks in the sentence itself!  Some contracts and proposals I&#x27;ve written contain these, and some A/B testing with them was interesting!<p>I got a lot less questions using line breaks to segment complex information into smaller, consumable, but connected chunks.  And those deals just moved too.  Not as many issues.  In one sense, it really does manage down the hiding of something in a wall of text, &quot;didn&#x27;t you see that?&quot; style.  I prefer that as well.  And like I said, it&#x27;s been productive in that context.<p>Having said all that.  Thanks!  Maybe you are not in the minority, and I sure don&#x27;t want it corrupted on mere style issues.<p>I&#x27;ll up the paragraph compliance and see how it goes here.  Of course, I&#x27;m bound to go looking back through things in some lame attempt to better understand votes and style now too.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m OK with not being popular, and all that.  The dialog here is great.  I also know my perspective is not a common one to this crowd too.  Fine.  My biggest frustration is often downvotes without commentary.  I read absolutely great comments here, and very frequently find serious thoughts bubble up from the many discussions.  Worth it.<p>It&#x27;s OK to be wrong or challenged!  We are better for it, but only when there actually is a meaningful dialog associated with all that.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s just all negative and rather useless.<p>That, of course, is written for passers by in this dialog.  I really do wonder what the downvotes are for and what the other party might suggest as an alternative...  That&#x27;s a bit of a ramble.  Thanks for just putting it out there.  I much prefer it.",1430296769

9457035,comment,9454440,9454544,0,0,randomsearch,,,"Meta-lesson: if you want to learn more wisdom, experiences are key. Get a diversity of experiences, do things that are outside your comfort zone and you will collect wisdom. Don&#x27;t be scared to take detours in life. Travel, socialise with unusual people, try your hand at everything. Never stop learning.<p>1. Good friends are more valuable than cool friends. Learn who to trust and who&#x27;s a flake. Remain friends with the flakes, but don&#x27;t rely on them.<p>2. Don&#x27;t stay where you&#x27;re unhappy. Give it some time, then move on. Try something else.<p>3. Focus, focus, focus when you&#x27;re doing one thing. Other times, branch out.<p>4. When you&#x27;re young you are time rich and cash poor; when you&#x27;re old you are cash rich and time poor. Don&#x27;t put things off until you&#x27;re older - travelling when retired will not inform your life.<p>5. The happiest people have good work-life balance. This may not go down well on HN, but having seen people around the world living different lives, this is a general observation. A relative was a counsellor, and he told me &quot;No-one [at the end of their life] ever wishes they&#x27;d spent more time at the office.&quot; Perhaps working long hours for a while with a view to achieving this balance later is OK.<p>6. Forget the money. <a href=""https://vimeo.com/63961985"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/63961985</a><p>7. Take holidays. Regularly. Force yourself to.<p>8. The secret to stamina is sleep.<p>9. Mix with people of all demographics, or you will end up with a narrow view of life.<p>10. If you&#x27;ve thought about doing something for a long time, you should probably do it.<p>11. If you&#x27;re having a conversation with someone about breaking up with your partner, then it is time to break up, or at least, take a break and see how it feels - don&#x27;t waste your time and your partner&#x27;s time procrastinating.<p>12. In relationships, you should always make extra effort, even when you&#x27;ve already made extra effort. Relationships take a lot of work, long-term. Surprise your partner.<p>13. Really listen to people. It&#x27;s such a hard skill to develop. Start today.<p>14. Realise how lucky you are to wake up with hot water, heating, and nice food. Many people in the world don&#x27;t have these luxuries. Living on no money when travelling is a good way to learn this.<p>15. Travel. But don&#x27;t party the whole time. Often travelling is best done mid-late 20s when you&#x27;ve done the partying thing. Stay with local people. Don&#x27;t plan too much. Get into the countryside.<p>16. If you&#x27;re writing an email and it feels uncomfortable, you should probably not send it. Or at least wait for the morning :-).<p>17. Sometimes, deciding to do nothing is a decision in itself. Solutions can present themselves.<p>18. Have a huge party every birthday. Don&#x27;t fight ageing, embrace it and celebrate being alive :-).<p>19. Don&#x27;t criticise things without providing an alternative. If you feel angry in an argument, you&#x27;re probably wrong.<p>20. Don&#x27;t do a PhD straight after you graduate.<p>21. When in love in a relationship, throw yourself into it. Don&#x27;t have regrets. Always tell people how you feel. It may be a car-crash at the time, but you&#x27;ll learn from it and feel better about it your whole life.<p>22. At the end of your life, they&#x27;re going to put you in a box in a hole in the ground, and that&#x27;s it. Every moment of life is precious. When you&#x27;re on your deathbed, even the idea of one more normal day at work will look unimaginably brilliant. Develop that feeling now.<p>23. Meditate. Unlearn what you have learned.<p>24. Whenever you think something nice about a person, say it. There&#x27;s enough negativity in the world. Love your friends and tell them you love them.<p>25. Read books. Lots and lots of books. Read &quot;East of Eden&quot; by Steinbeck. You&#x27;ll see why.<p>26. In love, in work, in life, never ever settle. It is better to be alone than to marry a person you don&#x27;t truly love.<p>27. When giving people advice, they usually only want you to confirm their decision. Listen and talk things over. And even if you do give them advice, they&#x27;ll just ignore and do what they want in the long-term.<p>28. Old(er) people are a great source of wisdom, but you won&#x27;t take their advice seriously until you&#x27;ve experienced it yourself.",1430296066

It could however hold encrypted data or be used to replace car keys etc. When it comes to physical access I normally just authenticate using the devices hard coded UUID. This is at least significantly better security than a traditional metal key which can be trivially picked. I modify things with NFC Reader/arduino/relay setups to read my UUID and start/stop lock/unlock things such as my motorcycle.<p>You also have 1k of read/write storage so there are a number of interesting possibilities there. Mine often contain my info as a vcard so anyone can tap my hand to import my contact info. Or sometimes it might launch a rickroll.<p>The magnet has been really interesting. I am constantly finding EMF around me. Knowing if a power strip is on without fiddling with it, knowing if wires are hot without touching them, knowing when I fill up a soda cup exactly where under the counter the motor is, knowing where transformers are in walls. It is I admit mostly a curiosity, but I have learned to use it as a tool instinctively. When I am trying to hold screws up in hard to reach places, when I have lots of tiny screws I need a secure place to hold, or when I drop a screw in a spot just big enough for a single finger to reach. I don&#x27;t even think about it anymore. It is just like &quot;oh I have this tool&quot; or &quot;oh there is EMF over there&quot;. It is interesting how the brain just starts to accept new abilities to the point they can be used passively.<p>It also has some fun side effects. For a while I thought the compass in my smartphone was broken. Had to learn to stop holding it in my right hand. I can &quot;feel&quot; music if i put my finger near a speaker. Hard to describe. Equally hard to describe is when I encounter a string magnet and the magnet under my skin flips. It is... not painful, but certainly not enjoyable. Would do it all over again though.",1430295997

1357187,comment,1356781,1356781,0,0,a2tech,,,"From my time working at McDonalds back in highschool I can tell you they had solved this problem already. The head machine in the back office was running AIX, and all the POS terminals netbooted a linux variant from it. There was also a secondary server which no one touched that did the most critical job of receiving, tracking and reporting orders. Windows on a dumb POS terminal? That just sounds like a straight up bad idea to me.",1274183896
1357186,comment,1356781,1356977,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>Rolling out updates to production without testing them first is a fail</i><p>Deploying McAfee in the first place to all those terminals is a painful process by itself, yet many people do it because of the ""extra"" security it provides. When you can't trust something like McAfee for your production, then you're doing something wrong, and that's not the lack of testing upgrades to McAfee ;)<p>IMHO, the WTF here is that they've used Windows in the first place for what are in essence dumb terminals that help them manage drive-through orders ... for that you can always deploy a highly customized and minimal Linux OS, with most of the ports blocked and with a minimal number of services running, with reduced capabilities and enhanced with Linux SE if you're a security freak  ... making the area of attack for any potential threat a lot smaller.<p>Then you wouldn't need a piece of shit like McAfee to handle your security ... all anti-viruses lately are pieces of shit IMHO.<p>> <i>The real issue here has nothing to do with Linux or Windows</i><p>I think it does. On that terminal they could've had a small Linux image providing a ssh server, whose purpose would be to boot into it in cases of emergency. And you can control a Linux instance a lot more efficiently remotely. Try doing that with Windows.",1274183892
1357185,comment,1356822,1356822,0,0,silkodyssey,,,"I am not sure selling privacy is such a great idea. People tend to see privacy as more of a right then a privilege and facebook's actions of late has been viewed as a violation of  these rights. To ask users to pay to keep their content private would probably make matters worse and send facebook on a similar path to the one mugabe took zimbabwe on.<p>I think the premium services model is an interesting one however. This could provide an additional revenue source for facebook but I think it raises an interesting question. Are the users of facebook more valuable to the company as customers or as products. Or in other words, is there more money to be made in advertising than in premium services?<p>With all the brain power and talent of the people at facebook it's likely that these ideas and more have already been considered and in the initiatives that the company has taken recently shows which model they prefer.",1274183888

After wrapping it up, on Friday afternoon, you want to play a fun game which still has some educational content.  So you print out one Parts of A Cell bingo card for each student in your class and explain how bingo works (or not, because they've almost certainly played before).<p>Then start calling things like ""This center of the cell is where the chromosomes are stored"".  Kids mark ""nucleus"" on their bingo card.  Repeat a few times -- somebody wins, the rest of the class comes close to winning (this is the diabolically brilliant thing about bingo), everybody is happy and most don't realize they've just reviewed some vocabulary.<p>Yes, this is a quite common activity in America.  You'll find it in almost any book of teacher activities from elementary school through high school.<p>Bingo has a few features which make it particularly good from the teacher's perspective, incidentally.  It scales to any number of kids with one teacher (not true of all games), it performs excellent crowd control since all students are forced to proceed at the same pace (<i>very</i> not true of all games), it doesn't pit students directly against one another (many American teachers do not believe that is wise), it is very difficult to be bad at bingo (in a way it is not difficult to be bad at e.g. spelling bees), there is an element of luck involved so the winner will almost certainly not be the strongest student in the class (some teachers believe this is wise), etc etc.",1274182550

1357151,story,,,43,37,wonderwheelhuh,"Ask HN: Is Google cataloging my girlfriends?",,"	I recently did a search on Google using the ""Wonder Wheel"", which lists related queries as spokes off of your original query. When I searched with my girlfriend's name, one of the spokes was my own name. Not a problem here, as many search results point back and forth between the two of us (blog, twitter, etc).<p>However, another spoke off of my girlfriend's name was surprisingly my ex-girlfriend's name. Now, of course, this might make sense if they had any related search results, but they don't. There's absolutely nothing on the web that directly links one to the other or contains both of their names. Moreover, there's nothing on the web that links me to my ex, so it can't even be an indirect connection of that sort through me.<p>Point is, I'm concerned as to how Google came to link the two. Since my current girlfriend and ex have never, to the best of my knowledge communicated online in any way (publicly or privately), the only explanation I can come up with is that Google has taken note that my girlfriend and ex may have done Google searches on each other. Has an invasion of privacy gone on here? Can you think of any other possibilities?<p>UPDATE: If we don't come up with a reasonable explanation, how should I take this up with Google?<p>FURTHER UPDATE: Anyone interested in trying the search from themselves can leave contact info for me somewhere.

This model of structs-with-methods had already started appearing in C, in the form of APIs built around sets of functions that all operated on the same struct, which was passed as a void* as the first parameter of all the functions (void* for encapsulation purposes); see the pthreads API, for example. So in some ways it's also a consistent, and even sort of naturally arising, model of OO, sort of an organic development out of structured programming, where structs and associated functions serve a main role in the structuring. It's of course a quite different notion of OO from Kay's message-passing, so maybe should have a different name, if it were an ideal world?",1274181265

First, what actually happened was that at the point where that service would have been most valuable they stopped providing it. There seems to be a difference in value between idealized theoretical HFTs that provide liquidity at all times, and real HFTs that provide liquidity when there's plenty of it around anyway.<p>Second, ""they abruptly took X away and the results were bad, therefore X was providing something valuable"" is an unsound argument -- e.g., coming off a drug cold turkey can be very bad even if the drug was doing you no good at all. It doesn't seem implausible that <i>a sudden drop in liquidity during a market crash</i> might be a very bad thing quite regardless of the optimal level of liquidity in general.",1274180784

Last I checked, it was in the neighborhood of $80. Sadly, @bonsaitree is probably right: even if you win, this probably isn't worth your time. One thing you might try, which worked for me once, is to type something up that resembles a lawsuit and mail it to them with a note that you're about to file this, so this is their last chance to settle first.",1274180783

Multiple plans confuse the user; think about the billions of different Windows editions. Best to keep it simple; the existing ""you either pay or not"" plan model was simple and elegant.<p>We had a great discussion about the fallacy of having too many plans on HN maybe about a year ago, unfortunately I can't find it though.

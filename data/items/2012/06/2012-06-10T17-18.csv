Intellectuals are also susceptible to cognitive dissonance and compartmentalization, especially when there is social pressure to change your beliefs, and doubly so if you hadn't explored the rationality behind being an atheist (speaking in general, not necessarily about Strobel).<p>I glanced briefly at the Wikipedia article and some of its references but couldn't find anything particularly noteworthy (perhaps you could point out some examples). My first impression is that there's no reason to think he used a rational process over a process motivated by some other reasons.<p>Atheists converting to religion is mostly support for religion's incredible strength as a meme (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology_of_religion#Memes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology_of_reli...</a>).",1339351199

4091686,comment,4089943,4090753,3,0,billpatrianakos,,,"<i>The ""reality distortion field"", ""fanboys"", etc, mostly BS from people trying to justify being cheapskates, or feeling some envy for others that can afford more expensive gear""</i><p>I agree that it's BS but I don't think the reason is mostly about envy or cheapness. I believe it's about feeling superior for <i>not</i> using the expensive trendy thing. It's a way of saying ""I'm good at my job and more skilled than you are which is why a MacBook is beneath me. I prefer the Linux machine because I'm one of the elites who knows how to <i>really</i> use it"".<p>People are just religious about their OS, even the ones who claim not to be and go off on diatribes about whatever gear being too expensive or just trendy. I'm a Mac and Xubuntu user who has recently been forced to develop on Windows while at work and I can say that beauty is important and the Mac exudes beauty. Win7 is decent too. But I bring it up because as a user of all 3 OSes I'll often get asked what I develop on. Instead of explaining in detail how I use all 3 at different times and appreciate each for their specific upsides I'll usually just say ""Mac"" or ""Linux"". No matter which I choose to say though the person asking usually always says ""oh, how come you don't use Mac, it's all Unixy but pretty and easy"" or ""Why aren't you using Linux? Are you a fanboy or need your hand held to use a computer?"". In all of these cases it's obvious the person has a superiority complex about their choice of platform.<p>And there's a hierarchy of how people think they're superior for using whichever one with Windows at the bottom:<p>If you use Windows, well, people just like to hate on Windows (and I personally don't blame them but I can still see why some like it).<p>The Mac users talk shit about Windows users because they believe they're part of an elite club full of design-minded hipsters. Web dev Mac users will add that Windows sucks for development (which it kind of does unless you're deploying to a full MS stack).<p>Linux users look down on both Mac and Windows users. They'll say the Mac users prefer form over function, need their hand held, don't like to control their PC (implies lack of skill), and are just following trends. They'll say much of the same about Windows with some added remarks about MS being the devil (as it pertains to FOSS).<p>No matter what one says about the other I think it's all about superiority. People justify their choice of technology by making themselves believe their choice is the best. They tend to ignore the fact that people have certain personal preferences, different use cases, and different backgrounds when making these criticisms. Developers especially will tend to think every other developer has a similar workflow and is working with the same technologies, therefor their choice of platform is what everyone else should use because ""I get shit done more efficiently with this so if others don't that means they're somehow less skilled than me"". Envy and money no doubt do play some role but I think it plays a smaller role than you say it does.",1339351148

4091661,comment,4087631,4090732,2,0,floomp,,,"> Atheism is just as unprovable as theism.<p>Perhaps, but what matters is that it <i>asserts less</i> than theism. When you start from no evidence, you need to believe in as little as possible until enough evidence presents itself that you can change your mind.<p>This is especially true given that religion has a highly plausible explanation as man-made, a creation of human imagination. When you have a collection of assertions, with no evidence, and the only physical source is the human mind itself, why would you believe it has any correspondence with reality?<p>> And it's fairly easy to reconcile a belief that evolution is true with a belief in a complex force that influences things in the background<p>I never disputed this.<p>> To believe that this is impossible and that we're capable of observing/measuring every part of reality is hubris.<p>I feel like you have created a strawman, because I never used any of these arguments.<p>Yes, of course we don't know every happening in the universe. Yes, our senses and reasoning skills are limited. That doesn't make religion true. How could it? Religious people have the same senses, the same access to knowledge as everyone else. I don't believe that religious people have any insight into the workings of the universe that no one else does, especially given that there are so many religions that can't agree with each other about even basic tenets. It's a very human creation - not a truth of the universe.<p>But I'll never assert that theism is impossible. That wouldn't be defensible, because we don't have all the information in the universe (or outside it!). <i>Of course</i> it's possible, but that doesn't matter, because we have no evidence whatsoever to believe it.",1339350582

4091655,comment,4091199,4091199,10,0,trevelyan,,,"This post does not pass the smell test. Yes, there is a lot of corruption in China and the political elite is enriching itself at the expense of the public and private sector. One mechanism for this certainly involves the government suppressing interest rates on bank deposits, and then directing banks to provide loans to preferred enterprises, which often engage in real estate. This is not actually a horrible approach to development since it keeps the government from having to finance everything up-front and a lot of the time the projects actually end up working. But sometimes it leads to non-performing loans and everyone knows there is much more of this than is claimed.<p>But even so the alarmism doesn't make any sense. If we multiply the amount of state-acknowledged NPLs at the largest five Chinese banks (~300 billion RMB) by an order of magnitude and we still only have 500 billion USD in bad assets. Sure this is a lot of money, but the Chinese government has previously dealt with the NPL issue by dumping cash into the banking sector and will doubtless continue to do so if necessary to maintain the status quo. 500 billion dollars still pales in comparison to China's more than 3 trillion in foreign currency reserves, so who cares? In reality, this system is actually sort of preferable since no-one can effectively loot state currency reserves yet, so bailing out the banks gets the money back into play.<p>To the extent there are stresses in the system, its that real estate development has been on the rocks since 2008 and prices are getting past the point where people can throw themselves into practical servitude in order to buy property. If you follow the Chinese media, right now it looks like the bubble will play out with local governments buying properties from cash-strapped developers at inflated prices (bonus question: guess who will issue the loans to finance this?) in order to turn them into social housing projects (bonus question two: guess who you need to be related to in order to get apportioned these assets?). Since it seems likely the poor are going to get screwed regardless, the real losers in the coming years are Chinese citizens locked into 30 or 40 year mortgages on underwhelming properties who will soon find themselves doubly-screwed as cash-strapped localities who can no longer charge real estate developers such inflated prices for real estate switch to issuing property taxes instead.",1339350456

The video narrator even says that writing VBA is slower because you have to declare variables before use. I'm sure HN has had plenty of debates about declaring variables in the past, but personally I don't feel it slows me down much more than just thinking of a variable. Anyway, by default you don't have to declare variables in VBA, though it is good practice, especially for larger projects.<p>Also, that 40-line+ heap of VBA they show being changed into 14 lines of Python is rather unfair. They've written a function for finding the minimum in a range and then loop through a range when they could use worksheet functions (also accessible via VBA) for both. I make it around 12 lines of VBA if you do it that way. Or you could just use 3 worksheet functions and no macros at all.<p>OK, so these hypothetical beginners may not know the best way to do things in VBA - but they probably aren't going to use lambdas in Python as in the example, either.

The last place I read about the taxes and overheating thing was in the 'The Affluent Society' written by J. Galbraith.  Written in 1958, it was a best seller at the time.  The book presents a really good critique about blindly pursuing economic growth.<p>Generally, I am of the opinion that as we make significant gains and improvements in efficiency, productivity, and technology the number of jobs created for each dollar directed towards investment and business creation will significantly shrink.  This will make it difficult to achieve wide-spread prosperity by encouraging investment, as the wealth will increasingly be concentrated at the top (we are already seeing this happen).  More likely, we will have to transition to a post-labor economy (there are a few random discussions about this on the internet, but as far as I can tell this is a fairly new idea).  Unfortunately for those that lean on the libertarian side, a stable and successful post-labor economy involves high taxes and large social programs (of course this assumes that we can even attempt to make this transition).<p>Sorry, kinda went off on a tangent, but I think this idea is very relevant to any discussion regarding our approach to economic recovery.

Other than that, yes, let the market evolve without interference.  Do you really think that Manhattan would end-up clogged with bad cabs from curb to curb?  No.  Beyond a certain population of cabs it will become unprofitable.  At some point some would exit the market and do something else.  Others might dive for low pricing.

In reality the result is exactly the opposite:  The rules and regs keep entrepreneurs without lots of money out of some markets and the entitlement programs sap any drive to grow and succeed from the less fortunate.

Length constraints kill the quality of many student, academic, and professional writings.<p>In the last 10 years of my education, I routinely submitted works less than 80% of the required length and still received A grades. Most instructors are reasonable enough to know that high quality work does not need to meet arbitrary constraints.<p>I wish educators would stop providing length constraints, even when students request them. Unnecessary verbosity should be punished, not rewarded. Succinct, precise, unambiguous, and accurate writing needs to be encouraged.",1215471056

239269,comment,238325,239249,0,0,tptacek,,,"You said:<p>""Hacking and painting have a lot in common. In fact, of all the different types of people I've known, hackers and painters are among the most alike.""<p>Your critic refuted that hacking and painting have much in common, and probably (but obviously speculatively) that hackers and painters are among the ""most alike"" of all the people you know.<p>And again, this appeared to me to be the central argument of your essay; it would not have been so widely noted had it argued instead that ""hackers are like everyone who does constructive work"", because by enlisting gardeners, grade school teachers, and psychologists, that argument reduces to ""hackers are like many of the people you know"". A barista at Intelligentsia Cafe downstairs from me invented an excellent drink --- horchata with a shot of espresso. Hackers are apparently also like him.<p>At this point, because you are calling me names instead of rebutting any point I make, I can only guess that you think none of these points are valid, and that hackers and painters share a unique bond, one that you feel your art education and work history allowed you to reveal in an essay (were it not so, the topic wouldn't merit the work you put into it). If you're seriously asking me the questions you're asking because you want to know the answer, and not because you want to win an argument, I'll say that when I read ""Hackers and Painters"" originally, I agreed with you. When I read your critic, I believe him more: there's there's little interesting to say about the relation between hacking and painting as practiced by modern professional artists.",1215469932

Toking up and killing brain cells""<p>Note I'm a libertarian and don't think that government has any business with what I choose to ingest. But heck, if you want to post an article on how good it is to toke up for your schoolwork, you gotta expect to hear some people who disagree for various reasons, right? What do you guys want, to be able to smoke it up and not have anybody say ""what a waste -- can't you succeed without all the partying?"" The reaction seems very mob-like.<p>There's all kinds of cool subtopics to this - the role of self-medication, the differences between pot and alcohol cutlures, the various moral implications of ingesting various substances, the stereotypical toked-up college liberal going to school for life, etc. Fun stuff to kick around, in my opinion.",1215469817

This means that if a part of the country needs more water, electricity, rails, etc. to support factories, they get it.<p>I bet now that Mexico's institutions are becoming more modern and since they have less transportation expenses to the US this will change very quickly and Mexico will be a manufacturing hotspot.",1215469663

239261,comment,238908,238908,0,0,swombat,,,"I could say we're doing 100% time in my company. We don't have offices or office hours, and no micro-management. Myself and the other coder/designer do what we do because we want to, and because we're damn proud of designing the best damn product (and making a good bit of money at it).<p>I've found, in practice, that I do my best work when doing what I really want to do. So, being the project manager as well as a programmer, I've set up the management structure so that we commit to doing 6 user-visible items per week (split into 3 mini-iterations, times 2 people). Our business guy (who happens to be the CEO, sort of.. but we don't like titles) is happy, since he get (at least) six new things to show users and get feedback on each week. We're happy, since we get to spend our time working on the bits that we really care about, or that we feel need attention, whether visible or not.<p>In practice, I work extremely hard on this business, but not because of working hours. As an example, on Saturday I spent about half a day doing a fairly significant refactoring of a part of our Flex code. This morning I spent a few hours building a connection status monitor. All of these are tasks that could take forever if they were ""official"" tasks in a more structured environment, but because I want to do them they take comparatively little time, and are literally given birth to in a rush of caffeine and enthusiasm.<p>Anyway, boiling it down to a point: if you've done your hiring (for lack of a better word) right and motivated your team well, you can just set things up so they'll spend 100% of their time doing whatever the hell they want, and you'll get brilliant results. The minute you find yourself counting hours, you've failed miserably.",1215469546

Doing drugs while you are young is a great way to avoid becoming this bitter later in life.<p>You remind me of a slightly more evolved version of those 90 year olds who hate anyone who isn't as repressed and miserable then they are.  So you made choices according to the conventional wisdom of your time, your life sucks as a result, and you're getting more and more trapped in your shitty, repeating cycle as the time to get out gets smaller and smaller.  You're going to die (tick tock, tick tock), and instead of doing all the unimagined cool stuff you would of dreamed up while using drugs responsibly, you're going to waste all of this beautiful gift that is our fleeting life doing stuff you hate.  Each day, you feel it coming, and go through it anyway.<p>And, to top it off, when you die, you'll think your ascending into heaven, and God, a black woman, will meet you at the gate with dreads and a gold and green cap, and a blunt with 4 grams of hydro in a swisher sweet wrapper, and say ""I put all those drugs all over the planet so you could use them to help you be creative enough to invent the future, and you failed to do your part because you were too distracted from the perpetual cycle of maintaining illusions.  Fuck you, mon, I'm sending you back as a cockroach.  You don't need more then a brainstem, because you never use it anyway.  If living as a thoughtless drone in a hivemind was good enough for you this time, that's all you get the next time around.""  Then, the gates will slam shut, and you'll see God and Sagan and Erdos and Steve Jobs, all taking hits of that blunt, planning the evolution of humanity, and bumping some new Radiohead, while your consciousness gets shunted into the body of a cockroach so you can relive life in a more metaphoric expression of the way you chose to live in your human form.<p>Sounds less like a problem with people who use drugs and more like a problem with how your choices have sucked, and continue to suck at very deep levels of reality.",1215469416

7363758,comment,7360011,7363354,1,0,dangrossman,,,"That seems a naive sentiment to me. You say &quot;go fully autonomous&quot; as if that&#x27;s a capability that exists when it doesn&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that an autonomous computer program today is capable of deciding when to shoot missiles at people, when to shoot down another aircraft, or when to drop bombs on a building. I don&#x27;t think a program, with no human input, no GPS, at night, in inclement weather, in the face of enemy sensor jamming, is even able to decide if it&#x27;s reached its target accurately enough to then attack that target. I also don&#x27;t think any computer program, even operating only in a simulation, can perfectly evaluate the acceptable level of collateral damage to civilians and infrastructure from its decisions -- to decide, for example, whether it should complete its mission of bombing an enemy unit if that unit enters a home or a hospital. I also don&#x27;t think either of us is more informed and smarter than the US military and US congress, both of which have decided that there is still a future for manned aircraft for all these reasons.<p>I don&#x27;t believe you really think otherwise either. &quot;At this point&quot;, we don&#x27;t even have autonomous cars that work in the real world. With all the best minds in AI working on the problem, with a working GPS and a paved road, our &quot;Google cars&quot; are still foiled by such simple things as a foggy morning blinding the LIDAR. It&#x27;s going to be a long time before you replace the human pilot in an F15 or a B2.",1394240330

For example, neither you nor they likely use the Boost libraries.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s a bit of a distraction. &quot;Most programmers&quot; aren&#x27;t all that good at programming, or judging what makes a good language. How important then is it that I weigh your projection of their ideas of right or wrong?<p>In Python it absolutely, positively, without a doubt is not a bad thing to have a function which accepts multiple data types. Some trivial examples are len() and iter(). Since you don&#x27;t like the core language design in Python, I think it&#x27;s safe to argue that your sensibilities are going to have many objections to any other part of the language.",1394240145
7363743,comment,7362327,7363313,2,0,srean,,,"The word RAII by itself is too non-specific. People typically mean: use (i) a scoped/auto pointer or (ii) a shared pointer (thats C++ speak for reference counted pointers). These are good thumb rules to rely on, but in itself they are very inadequate.<p>First, auto or scoped pointer gets you a stack discipline. If your objects weren&#x27;t very big, you might as well create them on the stack itself. More efficient and suitable for multithreading. If the lifetime does not follow the lexical stack then you are out of luck with this style of RAII.<p>Next, reference counted pointers: Cycles are clearly a problem. The traditional mantra is: use weak pointers to break cycles, but then you are back to error prone manual management (of cycles). If I am to be trusted with using weak pointers correctly, I wouldn&#x27;t be too bad with manual memory management either. Pure functional languages with eager semantics do not allow cycles, so are ref counts a good idea in such cases ?<p>Although, many do not think about it that way, reference counted system is a _garbage_collector_. Just a particularly simple one. Just because one understands how it works, does not disqualify it from being a garbage collection system. It is just not a very efficient garbage collector for cases where running time is sensitive to cache locality, which is true fairly often.<p>I am quite excited about Rust&#x27;s regions. I dont think programming with regions is easy and you would want to have a garbage collector anyway. I hope this style of programming sees more mainstream visibility. Something should come out of all the MLton work on this. EDIT Indeed meant MLKit but it draws enough from MLton that I thought HNers would be able to relate.<p>There is also D&#x27;s scoped guards, but I am not yet familiar with what they do.",1394240144

7363734,comment,7361824,7363665,3,0,ianstormtaylor,,,"Yeah it depends on what your use case is to begin with. If it&#x27;s just the simplest blog with a running series of Markdown files, then really any of the static site generators will do. But once you get into trying to implement some more advanced features then you run up against the limitations of most (if not all) of them because they assume way too much up front. A couple real-world examples from us at Segment.io are:<p>Documentation - for our docs[1] we want to be able to use the same simple static site generator without having all of the blogging logic. Basically the nesting of the files should result in the nesting of the URLs. But we also want to be able to tie in metadata that we have in our database about all of our integrations. And we&#x27;d also like to be able to write custom handlebars helpers that turn a simple JSON object into a widget that renders API calls in any of our supported languages.<p>Academy - for our academy[2] I really want to get to the point where we can generate PDFs for each of our articles and being to re-distribute them that was as eBooks (or potentially for a collection of articles) because that kind of thing appeals to enterprises who are looking for guidance. And we could even end up doing the same thing with our docs pages. And then we also want to have custom handlebars helpers for<p>Blog - for our blog[3] we want just the most basic implementation, although maybe with some niceties about author metadata to load in avatars and such.<p>Whenever you try and get into additional features that weren&#x27;t considered by the original &quot;static site&quot; (or worse &quot;static blog&quot;) generators, you usually end up building really cludgey code, if it&#x27;s even possible.<p>So with Metalsmith we avoid all of that, because the plugins can do whatever they want, and it&#x27;s super trivial to add local plugins to the mix if you&#x27;re cooking up something which you know is unique to just you.<p>And the last thing was that we were sick of having a Ruby dependency (with all of the associated slowness) just to build our blog with Jekyll. Basically was increasing build times by an order of magnitude.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://segment.io/docs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://segment.io/docs</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://segment.io/academy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://segment.io/academy</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://segment.io/blog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://segment.io/blog</a>",1394239936

Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me to find other pilots who&#x27;d failed at that.<p>In the case of many of the incidents reported here, the scenarios have been recreated in flight simulators.  In the case of UA-232 in particular, I don&#x27;t believe <i>any</i> of the simulator pilots managed to exceed the performance of Alfred Haynes.<p>The official NTSB report is opaque on this but suggests simulator results weren&#x27;t encouraging as far as training to avoid this type of accident:<p><i>The DC-10 simulator used in the study was programmed with the aerodynamic characteristics of the accident airplane that were validated by comparison with the actual flight recorder data.  DC-10 rated pilots, consisting of line captains, training clerk airmen, and production test pilots were then asked to fly the accident airplane profile Their comments, observations, and performance were recorded and analyzed....</i><p><i>Overall, the results of this study showed that such a maneuver involved many unknown variables and was not trainable, and the degree of controllability during the approach and landing rendered a simulator training exercise virtually impossible.</i><p><a href=""http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf</a>",1394239187

I had time to kill every now and then so decided to start reading and working through the InDesign 2 instruction manual (actual printed manual). I&#x27;d learn something and small and think &quot;holy shit, this might actually be a wonderful application&quot;. It gave those tear to eye of joy type of moments constantly (something I don&#x27;t get much with just about anything anymore). So I worked on getting the designers to switch. They were skeptical and at first mildly unwilling because it would interrupt their workflow but were eventually forced to by our studio manager. Their attitudes changed very quickly despite the pains of learning a new app and dropping something that they were masters of.\nAnyway, while I had a rep for being quite technical and quick to learn stuff, they all had quite a few years experience more than me and were faster with the keyboard (I was no slouch). Switching to InDesign leveled the playing field dramatically for me, it was at that company where I think I went from juniorish/intermediate to senior level mac op within about a year or less. I decided to learn the native shortcuts because it was obvious that this was the app of the future. The designers used the Quark shortcuts but probably learned the native ones eventually. Well, one hopes anyway. Doing web application development now of course, can&#x27;t stand prepress which has quite a low glass ceiling and is quite depressing really.",1394237836

The screw is slightly crooked because of the improper technique.  Is the screwdriver fundamentally flawed because it allows the wielder to mess up? It&#x27;s difficult for me to conceive something as portable, usable, cheap, and effective as the screwdriver, that does the same thing, and does not allow me to mess up. You have to make a sacrifice in some important category to get that. Programming languages can be pretty similar. Some are designed to make it harder to shoot yourself in the foot, but are far less popular (ADA is the example I&#x27;d use).",1394236800

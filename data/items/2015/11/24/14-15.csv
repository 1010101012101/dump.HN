They only have ~30,000 soldiers, and maybe a few thousand military vehicles. 16,000 military targets would have ground them into proverbial dust.

Developing the code is an iterative process that refines your understanding of the problem and the correct solution, and only once you&#x27;ve done that do you know enough to write appropriate tests.<p>There are exceptions to this, but they tend to be less common or trivial. If you&#x27;re implementing a known algorithm, such as an implementation of a mathematical function, you know enough to write the test cases first. You can do it for very generic libraries too, like a library of sorting methods. But in practice most code is not so easy to spec completely before you start to implement it.",1448375885

So we&#x27;re not talking about an egregious violation here (egregious being up for interpretation.) The Turks say they warned the craft numerous times including points prior to crossing the border, so they were prepared to shoot it down after seeing it would cross if no course change was taken.<p>Some might ask what the harm is to Turkey in this case, and my guesses are this:<p>1. If Turkey didn&#x27;t take action, then they could set a dangerous precedent by which aircraft were tolerated to violate their airspace, but Turkey would then find it difficult to then crack down after the fact. How deep is a real incursion? At what point do they say &quot;ok, we&#x27;re really gonna shoot you down now!&quot;<p>2. The BBC brought up the fact that there are ethnic Turks (Turkmen) living inside Syria, and some of them have been targets of Russian/Syrian bombs. The Turks have been notably irritated at this, and so one could imagine that this gave Turkey an excuse to hit back.<p>I saw the initial Russian comments as insisting that their plane was downed by a SAM as a real desire to downplay the incident. But now that they&#x27;re acknowledging it was downed by a Turkish aircraft, it seems they&#x27;re at least wanting to object harshly. (Edit: That, and Turkish insistence that they did it. Maybe they didn&#x27;t see the wink?)<p>I agree with some of the other comments, it&#x27;s far too early, and even alarmist, to assume that much worse will come up this.

On Russian state television, there was little discussion of the Turkish claim they had shot the plane down, with anchors and analysts speculating that the Su-24 could have been shot down by rebels with anti-aircraft weapons. This chimes with the Russian Defence Ministry’s claim that the plane was shot down from the ground, but completely contradicts the Turkish statement that an F-16 from its airforce shot the plane down.&quot;",1448374863
10620792,comment,10620292,10620292,0,0,eveningcoffee,,,"Lets be more precise. It was shot down over Turkey territory (according to information provided by Turkey military).<p>Of course one could argue that the plane was just taking a shortcut over the small part of Turkey territory. The problem with this is that Turkey has warned Russians on many occasions to not do that. But in my opinion it does not look like there was any threat to Turkey.<p>In principle the Russians have become very cocky near all NATO borders, and Turks are the least PC NATO member, so one can say that Russians had it coming and it looks like they finally found their equally crazy nemesis. Anyway, the situation is alarming and it is not yet clear how the following actions would unroll.<p>The first reaction from Putin does not make it look like Russia would admit their fault, but I think that he is rather reserved.<p>My condolences go to the parents and relatives of the killed pilot.<p>Edit: Changed two paragraphs, added one more paragraph.<p>Edit2: It looks like Russians flew over Turkey territory towards their target zone (see the map provided in this thread) and then began to fly in circles over Turkey territory. They were shot at the second entry.<p>I do not know why Russians choose this route as it does not seem to be the most optimal one.<p>The length over Turkey territory is about 1500-1600 meters, SU-24 flies up to 360 m/s so it was about minimum 5 seconds flight, but as it was a second entry, I guess it does not matter that much.<p>Anyway, I think that both sides acted in a very unwise manner.",1448374845

The engine has simply too much power. A Falcon 9 first stage, stopped mid air has two choices, keep the motor on and go up, or turn the motor off and fall - and I don&#x27;t think the motor has too many extra restarts available.<p>Because of this inability to hover the Falcon 9 first stage, SpaceX is attempting to have the rocket&#x27;s vertical velocity reach zero at the exact moment the rocket reaches the pad. This is why when you watch the grasshopper or other SpaceX landing videos, you always wonder for a split second if the rocket has just smashed into the ground. In order for this to work, all nine axis (three each of position, rotation, and velocity) must be brought to zero at exactly the same fixed time. This is insane level control theory here.<p>Now this type of landing is theoretically possible - and I think it has been tested on the grasshopper at lower speeds, but it scares the willies out of me. There&#x27;s almost no room for error nor for the chaos of the universe.<p>New Shepard on the other hand, comes to a hover about 100? feet above the pad, moves horizontally to be above the pad, stops, then lowers itself down. This is tremendously simpler since the rocket only really cares about one or two set of axis at a time, it does not have to be nearly as precise, and you have time to fix anything that&#x27;s not lined up.<p>I&#x27;m still curious to see if SpaceX can pull off their landing style, or will instead change so that their first stages will be able to hover.",1448374190

Being able to throttle a single engine to 25% doesn&#x27;t matter so much if you can instead shut down 3 of 4 engines and throttle the remaining.<p>For a single-engine booster, 25% is still way too much thrust if you are shooting for orbit.  A modern booster is 90+% fuel.  So the empty or near empty returning booster will need an engine running at around 10% of launch thrust at the moment of landing.   That&#x27;s pretty much what SpaceX is doing by shutting down 8 of 9 engines and throttling the last to 80ish%.",1448374150

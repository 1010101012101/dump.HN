2110930,comment,2110863,2110863,0,0,solipsist,,,"Wow, the article and the embedded ABC video are embarrassing to even look at. It makes me lose faith in journalism.<p><pre><code>   1. No where is it mentioned that Bubble Ball only surpassed the
      *free* version of Angry Birds on the top *free* app chart. The
      article even links to the paid version of Angry Birds, saying
      that it was ""de-throned"" (spelled wrong); this is not true.
   2. They call him a ""tween"" in the video. He's 14 (four*teen*) years old.
   3. The video says he would have made $2 million if he had charged
      $1.00 for the app (which isn't even in possible) - I hate to break
      it, but I'm not sure if even a 1000 of them would have still
      downloaded the *Wake Up the Box* clone.

2110927,comment,2110021,2110021,0,0,dedward,,,"I've often thought in similar terms... and I think everyone has a different story here.<p>I used to write some simple software (we're talking some ASM and some BASIC here, with some C and Pascal - no OOP or design patterns or fancy stuff.... I was young, it was a while ago).  At some point I took some digital electronics course, and at some point during that course, when we moved from transistors to discrete logic ICs to Intel 8080 trainer boards programmed in Octal - something clicked.  I got it. I couldn't necessarily go out and build you a CPU - but I get it. 
Networking too.. I get it, down to the electronics, the modulation, the analogic/digital circuitry.  I get it enough to understand what's on both sides.<p>So where's my magic?  I may not understand the hellishly complex details in anything past the 486, with all the pipelining and caching and whatnot, but I get it enough to know what it's about.  There's no magic - I know I could go study (probably for a good long while) and understand it better.<p>So now there's no more magic (I never really felt there was, I knew I could always pick up a book and figure it out)  - but there is discovery.  It's the software patterns, the network protocols.  It's complex systems and emergent behaviour.  It's the interface between humanity and computers.  I get the internet (and local networking, and network stacks)  down to the bits - I love it when I find a  mysterious network behaviour that I can't seem to grok in my head - because I know that either I'm being fed faulty information, or my mental model is wrong (which means I might learn something - which is always good).  I love an especially frustrating problem.<p>As a generalist - a lot of that knowledge goes unused.  I get how SSDs work (I'm using one now) - I've had a decent career, and there are tons of avenues I could take if I need a hobby.. because it's all interesting.  But there's no magic.<p>TL;DR: The only magic left is human behaviour.",1295229499

It's a service to provide status pages for websites (similar to status.github.com or status.37signals.com).<p>https://statusdot.com<p>It's pretty basic right now: You set up a CNAME pointing at statusdot.us for (for your 'status' subdomain), so you can access the site by going to status.yourdomain.com. You give us a URL, we do a GET request every 5, 10, 15, 30, or 90 minutes. If that request doesn't come back with a 200 response or doesn't contain a string you specify, we consider it down. We display that information on a status page, along with your twitter account and status messages you can post. (We also send you an SMS message when your site goes down.)<p>We've got a few more features and a <i>ton</i> more polish left to do, but we wanted to soft-launch to get some feedback, so right now it's free for a couple of weeks.

2110916,comment,2109012,2109603,0,0,bane,,,"It's all rather confusing and complex (and reads a bit like an episode of connections), but the gist is this:<p>To gain access to a website and get an account, you need to supply your social security number as a convenient unique identifier. This is all so that if you do something bad, like commit fraud, or distribute child porn or whatever, the authorities can figure out who did it (I know, I know, there's an entire debate about why using your SSN like this is a bad idea). In the States, the government goes through all kinds of gyrations to ensure separation of interests to protect personal privacy. The same level of privacy protection simply doesn't exist in South Korea. To my understanding, this SSN gathering requirement is required by law.<p>Further complicating matters, encrypted communications (via web browser) are mandated by law to use an ancient <i>ancient</i> activeX control (like 1998 ancient) implementing an encryption standard called SEED. Why this is is one of those funny historic happenstances. In the late 90's South Korea's internet buildout was <i>booming</i> and the necessity for encrypted communications (for things like online purchasing) was seen as imminently necessary. If I recall, the U.S. was not allowing export of 128-bit encryption technology, and the exportable 40-bit SSL was considered not secure enough. So the South Korean government, in the interest of promoting online business, brought KISA (their NSA) in to develop a homegrown 128-bit encryption system.<p>SEED was then implemented as an ActiveX control for IE6 and a plugin Netscape and the use of this system was enshrined in law.<p>As you can imagine, the wheels of government turn incredibly slowly, even in Korea, so lawmakers have never really updated this law. Once Netscape went away, all that was left was IE and thus the stubborn persistence of IE6 to this day.<p>As you can guess this has left most Koreans with huge security vulnerabilities on their machines, and outdated browser (who's inadequacies they try to fix with Flash) and myriad other problems.<p>Fortunately, this may all end soon as there's growing momentum for the government to take another look at the law and bring South Korea's internet users into the 21st century.<p>TL;DR version:
If you want to use an online service in South Korea, you have to make an account, and to make an account you need to use your SSN, and since you don't want to transmit all that in the clear, you want to encrypt that number, and since you want to encrypt it you have to use SEED, and since SEED only exists as an ActiveX control, you are stuck with IE6.<p>Some more reading on it<p><a href=""http://seoulspace.co.kr/2010/03/09/ie6-no-more-not-in-korea/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seoulspace.co.kr/2010/03/09/ie6-no-more-not-in-korea/</a> (the comments are great)

Obviously people do, so there is a business model there, and it isn't freely communicated to the public.<p>While some firms operate like yours, with detailed checkin/checkout process, others seem to care less as long as you turn up in something with the right plates on, that seems to be the right make and color.   10 minutes at one of the large rental locations in LA will show this.  My thoughts are that these companies just work on volume, purchase the cars cheap, turn them over regularly and just work on pure numbers.<p>Whether this can translate to a mixed-lot private rental remains to be seen.  It is just too easy for a one-time renter to do a lot of damage to a vehicle and disappear, taking their facebook account with them.  The reputation model works well in many cases (see ebay with high reputation buyers/sellers) but breaks down at the starting point.  I guess it can be covered by a higher premium for first time renters but then that is going to dissuade new people from trying out the service.  Perhaps the company can offer cash bonuses to people willing to rent to first-time customers or something.<p>As for your last argument - I think - despite your valid claims, that a bog-standard rental car can be treated as a commodity, despite the mechanical complexity and insurance / liability issues.  It just takes the right mix of legal protection and insurance underwriting.  How you get that is the key to the puzzle, and the person that gets it right will win this battle, if it can be won.",1295227479

Assuming the wood is pine (likely, and also light), and using 350kg/m^3 as the pine's density (<a href=""http://www.simetric.co.uk/si_wood.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simetric.co.uk/si_wood.htm</a> the lightest figure quoted) that works out to about .55 kg.

They literally need to use other peoples money.  You could ask why AirBnB doesn't purchase apartments in New York and San Francisco.<p>A distributed model where other people contribute their money, and the business makes money as an agency is well established in other fields.  I know of many holiday properties where each individual apartment is privately owned, but the building is managed by a single entity.  The owners wear the depreciation costs and interest charges (if using borrowed money) but get to keep the majority of the revenue from rentals, and any capital appreciation from the property, or wear any losses from a drop in value.<p>In the same way, a startup can allow others to contribute the capital value, wear any depreciation, financing and insurance, and just take an agency fee.   This is really not much different to other rental car companies who presumably lease all of the rental vehicles either off some central owner of the vehicles, or directly from the manufacturer.  Or, perhaps they just have a large, revolving credit line which they use to purchase the vehicles.  They certainly aren't going to own them, so it really comes down to a definition of title.<p>I think the blurring here is that most people see car ownership as a strictly private-use phenomonen, whereas in property or boats, mixed private/investment or pure investment is much more common.",1295226993

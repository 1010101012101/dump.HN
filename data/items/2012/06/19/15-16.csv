What does ""stagnation in the community"" mean to you?<p>If it means ""overall, people lose interest and stop visiting to ask and answer questions,"" I don't see that. I'm not visiting to fill in all the gaps in SO's content, and feeling disappointed when there aren't many gaps to fill. I'm running into questions, Googling, and hoping to find my question already answered.<p>If I find it and it's not answered, I'll do research and try to answer it myself. If it doesn't exist, I'll ask. If I find the answer before anyone else does, I may answer it myself.<p>I'm not going to stop doing that, and I don't see why anyone else will, either. What the overall trends are in the site really has no bearing on my individual participation, so it never feels ""stagnant"" to me.<p>Maybe you're imagining users who show up and surf for questions to answer, and those people are getting bored? That's just not the way I use the site, though.",1340121587

Absolutely agree about the state of Bootstrap themes, which is why I tend to go pure custom with outsourcing. One suggestion I would have is to really hit hard about how yours stand out. Clearly, they are well designed, but someone who would be a buyer at that price point (doesn't need custom, but needs something nice and flexible) may not be educated enough to know why they should choose yours over the cookie-cutter $30 theme. The custom form and tables are particularly nice, but they are buried in the demo. I've spent a lot of time digging through bootstrap themes, and it took me awhile to figure out what made this one more compelling; less experienced users will surely have the same issue.<p>Good luck though; this is definitely an interesting space and I think you'll get some good results over time.",1340121385

You might like lolcats, and good for you if so, but not every site is about lolcats and you should not try to force every site to become a meme-fueled jokestravaganza.<p>There's nothing wrong with having focus. Moderators do often prevent communities from growing as much as they otherwise would, but so will any filter that keeps quality high by some metric that isn't ""Do we get the most readers possible?"" In Stack Overflow's case, a large part of its utility is that it's a no-messing-around question and answer site. Being ""the unification of people with a shared interest in a programming language or knowledge domain"" is not the site's goal any more than hosting funny pictures of cats is, so no surprise that the moderators kill that potential.<p>I do think they draw the line a little closer than I would and a lot of stuff they kill I would think it's OK to allow, but that's just armchair quarterbacking.

You write as if there were no engineering and UI tradeoffs in a customizable UI. There are, and they are very real --telephone support costs from people accidentally switching their UI to some other style is an obvious example.<p>Also consider all the code needed to implement the ""fluid GUI"" you mention, with menus that can be shown as ribbons, regular toolbars or what have you by user choice.

The app does use patented technologies. So from a legal standpoint, there is little chance this app and its company will survive the suit. One possibility for successful defense would be software patent law unexpectedly collapsing during litigation due to a surprise ruling by SCOTUS on some other case. This is a long shot. Another possibility would be the defending party countersuing, challenging the validity of the patent and succeeding. This is possible, but expensive to do and will take many years. Even if they succeed overturning the patent, it will still be challenging to prevail overall, given their intimate association with the patent holder and likelihood of existing contracts between them.<p>So what to do in the meantime? Normally what would happen is the plaintiff would seek the judge to issue an injunction against sales pending trial, which would have to prove there is a high likelihood they would prevail in the litigation.<p>This is being skipped because of the App Store situation, where there is a gatekeeper able to remove products from sale for arbitrary or even nonexistent reasons. The existence of these stores, free from competition (they certainly can not go to the Amazon iPad store and download the software there because Amazon isn't allowed access to install iPad apps therefore there is no competition and Apple has a monopoly on running iOS software stores) is a large threat to software and customer freedom.<p>I agree this is a really bad situation, but it is one that Apple customers voluntarily accept when they buy products for this platform, and that developers accept when they develop products for this platform. It's like buying a house with an authoritarian Homeowners Association that is capricious and issues fines for painting your fences the same color as before without paying $2200 to the History, Style and Architecture Review Committee to have a public hearing to review and approve your fence painting plans. It is no secret the system exists or how it works, and persons subjecting them to the whims of others in these situations know what they are getting into and accept the terms.<p>So what to do? Many things are possible. Here are a few.<p>1. As has been mentioned, disable all updates, turn off wifi, use this iPad only for this app and buy another iPad if you want to update it.<p>2. Purchase the multi-thousand dollar version on custom hardware published by the plaintiff. (Presumably insurance companies normally pay for this option.)<p>3. Jailbreak the iPad and convince the program's authors to release a jailbroken compatible version.<p>4.

They are paid entirely in distributions (ie, ""profit sharing""). LLC owners are subject to self-employment tax on all that income; in fact, an LLC owner must typically pay taxes quarterly, instead of at the end of the year as W2 employees are accustomed. The LLC structure does not (that I know of) afford a huge and obvious opportunity to cheat on your taxes.<p>Owners of S Corps <i>do</i> take salaries, and do withholding in much the same way as a W2 employee would.<p>Additionally, as company owners, S Corp owners routinely pay themselves bonuses (profit sharing, distribution, whatever you want to call it). This is normal and reasonable. The business does well, payroll is made, money is reinvested in the company, and what's left over is distributed back to the owners.<p>The scam is that this money is not for tax purposes treated as payroll. In particular, that money isn't subject to FICA.<p>As a result, S Corp owners are incentivized to claim the lowest possible salary (today, ""lowest"" meaning ""lowest you could reasonably get away with calling a market salary""). That's because the salary money is going to be subject to FICA. If the remainder of what the owner should fairly have been paid is issued in distributions, that money avoids FICA liability.<p>And so the IRS case files are littered with lawyers and doctors and dentists who set up their practices as S Corps and then try to claim the fair market rate for their participation in the company is, say, $5,000/year (""oh, I only come in on alternate Tuesdays!""). Their secretaries pay the full bite of FICA while living paycheck to paycheck, while the business owner makes payments on a vacation house with the money they save from this trick.",1340119742

They know how to make the POS systems fly. Oh and their supply chain software integrates with the inventory software, can you're product do that? No? Sorry we're going to pass. Not only that, they have tons of data warehouses of sales data going back to who knows when that the marketing people get to play with. They also may have a stringent budget and purchasing process and are most definitely led by non-technical executives. There is the old adage ""You get what you pay for"" and if you don't have to pay for the software then what do you get? They also have many locations (lets say 2000 for simplicity) all running the same registers. If your software doesn't support their registers, you can bet they are going to pass on you. Plus they have the advertising money to spend on AdWords campaign or paid search if need be.<p>Now a medium sized retailer a handful of locations. They are interested because it will allow their products to be found by those and they may be able to poach a few customers from the big box stores. Alas, but they too have existing POS software and inventory management software and would be willing to ditch them for something new. However, it may be hard for them to be the first to test out a new product since they rely on their customers and know that they could probably get the same items cheaper from a big box store. If there is any snag in their experience at their store (such as POS issues) than they could lose that customer for good. They are hesitant but would accept once it is proven and stable.<p>Then there are the small mom and pop stores. These may want to use the products but they don't have the infrastructure to support it. Heck, they are currently doing inventory in Excel and hate it, this would free up their time. But that free software isn't free when you need to buy new computers and registers to be able to support it.<p>Notice that I keep saying POS instead of just inventory management. The reason being is that those two need to integrate with one another and if you want live levels of stock at any given time, you will need to use the POS system as inventory management software is by the day (at least from what I've seen).<p>Plus, you get to the lock in factor. Is the software going to be free if I don't keep paying for the search stuff? What if I decide that it isn't working for us, do we have to switch software or can we keep using it for free? If you allow them to keep using it for free then there goes some profits. If you don't allow them to use it for free, then you get into a situation where it becomes a super expensive test since the software doesn't cost money but it costs time to set up the new software and train everybody on it and then if they don't like it switching back.",1340118872

4132134,comment,4131774,4131774,1,0,its_so_on,,,"Disagree completely.  EDIT: it's an important distinction to make, and when you say ""profitable since day one"" obvoiusly nobody expects that you made seventeen thousand dollars in sales your first day.  Maybe there is a better word for it (scantily profitable over the direct-but-not-opportunity-costs since day 1?) but if it's something you can claim, go ahead and do so for contextualization.  This is why:<p>There's a whole type of startup (call it type ""1"" whereas article is about type ""2""), which is more traditional, and the only possible model in many sectors such as hotels, restaurants, retail, etcetcetc, that is based on launching a business (as opposed to 'bootstrapping') from sizeable funds - often 20k-50k or more - and not even attempting to become profitable within 3-5 months, during which you expect to continue to pay out one or two thousand on office rental space, equipment, hosting, whatever.  An optimistic plan is to scratch the surface of breaking even around the one year mark.<p>When someone is, and has been, ""profitable"" since day one, (""type 2"") this is in stark contrast to this model.  This is the ""in our first few months we spent three-fifty on hosting while servicing our five paying customers and working hard coding and developing so we can grow our customer base and make our equity worth enough to sell some of it and raise a round, or at least have enough money coming in to grow organically and bootstrap to sizeable revenues.""<p>There's nothing wrong with either of the two models.  It's also probably the most important fact you need to know to contextualize a conversation about your business.  And the type 2 business that has paying customers but can't even meet it's hosting bills is fundamentally broken.  Hell, I can do that just by hosting up to five hundred gigabytes of files per person for five dollars per decade.<p>If you're not broken - and running this type of model - go ahead and boast.  And if boasting isn't enough, keep growing.",1340118024

5586175,comment,5585535,5586017,1,0,jamesmontalvo3,,,"As you said, we only do 2 EVs currently. However, we do have more than two entities working in parallel. For a hypothetical example, during a joint Space Shuttle and ISS EVA, there would be EV1 and EV2, but there might also be the Space Shuttle robotic arm and Space Station robotic arm (each run by at least one crewmember). Also, there may be a crewmember inside coordinating the EVA (reading procedures) who may have some tasks that need to be done to support the EVA, and there is commanding done from mission control. So that's 6 entities.<p>From an EVA planning perspective, we generalize that to three entities: EV1, EV2 and everyone else. That is, we have three columns in our Word document, and steps in the ""everyone else"" column will specify who is performing them, i.e. ""Station Arm: translate to hardware pickup location""",1366574271

5586167,comment,5585923,5585923,24,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Why do you so handily dismiss the article without addressing its content? He is bringing 'expensive' care to people who would otherwise be ignored and making more money to boot. He is doing this by being more efficient, distributed, modular, small and optimizing details right down to architecture and construction. In a world where a large chunk still die from trivial diseases, it is clear current methods do not scale. If this model can safely serve more people, more cheaply and is more profitable then it surely is worth trying. Our current approach to healthcare certainly could do with more efficiency. He states in the article that charity does not scale, even if that is the case, a more efficient healthcare system also improves the efficiency of charity by multiplying how far each unit of currency goes. Is that not what HN is about?<p>There is probably an Amdahl's Law style limit to this approach where certain expensive specialty care does not benefit from this type of parallelization. But much of the world is not healthy enough to have those as major concerns. Separation may be useful there too, perhaps prices for many treatments are inflated from too much coupling of services? We won't know without experimenting.<p>As for your link, I believe this is exacerbated by combining highly sterilized environments with sloppy practices. If people are in and out as quick as possible, and only key areas are kept highly sterile this may actually be a bonus. More practice from high throughput aslo drills checklists.  A quick google suggests 2% mortality rate and 3% H-aI. Even if padded, looking at his stats - 15,000 surgeries performed and operating since 2001; if it were really so bad I suspect complaints would be much more forceful and he would not be so profitable. Being profit motivated and no frills gives incentives to pay attention to waste, errors and quicker reaction time in dealing with those.",1366574152

It's easy getting the code written and tested because the code tends to be so succinct, the standard library already includes a lot of shortcuts, it's synchronous, there's a lot of metaprogramming features readily available and the interpretation allows for quicker testing when you can get the basic syntax right after some experience without requiring the help of an IDE as most Ruby code is written in text editors.<p>Languages that demand IDEs tend to be more complicated in many ways. They can be faster, but also might demand more code obfuscation through more code that need to be written like types and longer names and importing of libraries and so on. My pet peeve is that I absolutely love Ruby, but it indeed is not meant for ultimate performance. On the other hand, languages like Dart might allow for some compromise if you can get stuff done with less power at your hands like less metaprogramming and fewer shortcuts... Except that Dart is trying to tackle asynchronous programming with the standard libraries which is itself quite complicated (Future what?)<p>Go and Dart are not themselves too tuned for performance yet, even though they tend to be very quick when compared to Ruby.

For example, in the second photo, I would've tried taking this in three ways: 1. as-is, 2. strobed, and 3. HDR. The background exposure is pretty good, but the flowers in the foreground are underexposed.<p>* Watch out for stray junk in the foreground. In the bridge photo, I'd crop out the errant flowers at the bottom of the frame (and straighten it).<p>* If you have a lot of gray sky in your photo, your camera is going to do its best to underexpose the photo.

Microsoft project is the classic example, though industry trends seem to have made it a low priority for them.<p>All of these tools focus on creating gantt charts or similar, with independent subtasks that can be reliant on other tasks, broken into subtasks, group within barriers (milestones). They help enormously when you need to insert things or reorder stuff.<p>I've never seen one used to incorporate the actual detailed instructions for completing the task, generally because part of the task is figuring out how to do it. But I'd be surprised if you looked at a few different project management applications that there wouldn't be one or more that could be used that way. If nothing else you probably would be able to use the task description that's usually very short to include an arbitrary amount of text.<p>The biggest challenge might be in getting a report formatted to your liking at the end of the process with all the details nicely formatted. Most of these systems provide a great deal of extendability, so you might need to have some minimal development work done in terms of a custom report format. Or maybe not - these are enterprise systems that are usually loaded with special case features.",1366570987

If you have to think about it more, and come up with clever solutions while a faster language just lets you brute-force it, then they haven't really let you solve the problem more quickly.<p>(That said, programming competitions are a pretty unrealistic subset of what actual software engineering is like.  C++ is a fine language for programming competitions, because it's fast, excels at the sort of numeric manipulation that's common there, has a ""good enough"" standard library with the STL for common tasks featured there, and the common pitfalls of C++ development - memory management and slow build times, for example - won't bite you in programs of competition-length.

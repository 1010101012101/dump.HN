I said that the library  would guess that “&amp;” was HTML encoded.  You said “fix_entities is a parameter. It&#x27;s not guessing, you told it.”  I said that the example given has no such parameter.  You then turned around and said that it was a <i>success</i> that it guessed correctly, but my point was that it was, indeed, <i>guessing</i>, and might, therefore, guess wrong.<p>I don’t want to call <i>you</i> an ASCII neanderthal, really, and I’m sorry I did, it’s just that your library helps the actual ASCII neanderthals from having to bother with evolving.  This is my main complaint about this library.  It will probably be used by them, reflexively, to decode <i>everything</i>, even when the encoding <i>is</i> known, and therefore introduce (admittedly relatively small amounts of) data corruption (but these things have a tendency to crop up when you least wanted them).  Whereas if your library was <i>not</i> used, users would have to think about what decoding to use, use it, and not introduce data corruption.<p>Also, I have some misgivings about a one-size-fits-all solution of guessing encodings – I guess that it would never really work in quite the painless way most your users imagine.  To solve this, I advocated a user-customizable training approach, which would, for each user, be the best possible one for their use case.  It would <i>also</i> have the beneficial side effect of forcing the users to actually think about their data and what encodings it was <i>likely</i> to have and in what circumstances, thus making them evolve to Homo Unicodus.  ☺  Of course, I could be wrong about this, but my principal worry about this library, as stated above, remains.",1408247566

The pretence of a higher purpose of the NS system was in my opinion, that the nation will succeed in its god given plan to succeed. You can hear it shining threw in many of Hitlers speeches.<p>No, when you understand &quot;purpose&quot; in a strict religious way, it did not have such pretence. But when you have an open mind to something that is more common than religion, it definitively had.<p>There are also many things that are clearly directed into a cult or replacement-religion. Also Hitler uses many religious phrases and imitations. Many see this as a clear sign for a cult.<p>Also the fact, that for example the wife of Goebbels killed her children, speaks clearly that many people (many killed themselves either) lost all hope and life purpose, because the NS system was (for them) something like the salvation for the German nation.<p>>The entire German political system became a suicide and death cult, and swallowed itself whole.<p>Now you say it yourself and contradict yourself by saying that it became a cult. It was a kind of cult and thus had the pretence of a higher purpose. (of course, if you always define &quot;purpose&quot; as going to heaven, you are right -- but in my opinion there are different levels or kinds of purpose).<p>That is right. But this was possible, because with the dead of the system, many of the involved people also lost hope for Germany as a whole. I don&#x27;t want to excuse, what they did (some of them slaughtered their own people and behaved like real monsters), but in some cases it might become a little more understandable.<p>I also don&#x27;t want to show this cult in a shiny light. It was really a death cult (and that from the start) -- but because of a different reason: The system was based on the notion, that the German nation will rise -- and the condition for that was, that others had to fall. It was a kind of social-darwinism (hope, got that word right). This whole notion: I will rise, and others have to fall (for that) is anti-christian and a total abuse of Darwins findings.

They are countries that in the last 50 years or so were able to escape poverty in just one or two generations.  Maybe even Vietnam or Thailand which I think are not quite in poverty so not nearly as prosperous as Singapore or Korea.<p>The education system in both countries is really really intense -- like Korean kids go to school at 8am and get back home at 9pm!!!<p>It&#x27;s very hard to say -- obviously or there wouldn&#x27;t be poor countries!  For example, there are a lot of attempts to explain China&#x27;s success versus India.  Indians will blame corruption -- but there&#x27;s massive corruption in China.  Some observers say that it&#x27;s China&#x27;s iron-fisted rule that gets things done that&#x27;s driven development instead of India&#x27;s clunky not-so-effective democracy.  But most observers seem to find and you would expect that democracies tend to have economically better off populations.<p>India to some extent has become internationally famous as a hub for software development -- and it&#x27;s certainly helped India and positions India fantastically well for the future as softwares gets more and more important.  But if you look at India&#x27;s accomplishment to date and the IT industry -- it looks really pathetic actually!!  But that&#x27;s how you start.  India&#x27;s whole IT industry is around $100 billion/year in revenues for something like 2.5 million people.  IBM does that much in revenues with maybe 400k people or 16% as many people!!  Google does $60 billion/year or 60% of the entire Indian IT industry with something like 3% as many people...so Google is like 20x more efficient!!!  So the Indian IT industry is literally just throwing cheap labor at problems -- not very creative or intelligent.  But anyway, that&#x27;s how you start.  I wonder if you can go back and look at when China&#x27;s manufacturing hub was $100bn/year -- maybe sometime in the 1980s and see how it evolved versus India&#x27;s IT industry growth, and also how wages increased.  Maybe India can follow such a trajectory as China did.  China now wants to build up IT!<p>Just a few thoughts, observations!",1408245682

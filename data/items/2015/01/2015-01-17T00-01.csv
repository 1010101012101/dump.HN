All this stuff in packages innocuously named modbus_driver.deb or what have you, and all in absolutely the most archaic bash syntax possible.<p>Eventually somebody mixed a rm -rf /bin/* with rm -rf / bin/*, and the rest is history. They bricked about 100 embedded PC&#x27;s, all in remote locations, all powering powerplant SCADA systems that did stuff like connect to CalISO for grid management or collect billing information.

8902841,comment,8901141,8902180,0,0,xnull1guest,,,"> Certainly information from these businesses on how they believe different legislation will effect them is useful to voters, their representatives and their appointees in performing a legislative calculus.<p>> But what certain companies &#x27;advocate&#x27; for? This is hardly useful information for the design of legislation...<p>We agree. I&#x27;m not saying ignore everything they possibly say. What I am saying is ignore what they merely advocate for and pay attention to why they advocate for it and what information they can give relevant to the design of a healthy and flourishing industry.<p>When political discussion devolves into a series of corporate for-against it looks more like a sport and cheerleaders than a democracy. Legislation can not be about deciding who wins in the market but about designing markets that eliminate rent seeking, moral hazard, and externalization of costs while promoting fair competition between businesses of all sizes. You can&#x27;t know how to design such legislature without understanding the conditions of an industry and how changes will effect current players. But you also can not design markets within the confines of regulatory capture or by merely noting which current players will stand to benefit or lose from a given legislative delta.<p>The word insanity here is meant to convey a lack of grounding in the reality of the situation: advocation doesn&#x27;t signal whether legislation will make a market healthier or serve customers/citizens/nations. We know what Sprint wants - more money. What we need to know from Sprint is not whether given legislation will or will not lead to their getting more or less money but details that clarify how proposed legislation will or will not &quot;eliminate rent seeking, moral hazard, and externalization of costs while promoting fair competition between businesses of all sizes.&quot;",1421456355

(Digital subchannels are what UHF and cable were Back In The Day: Cheap timeslots filled with whatever someone has to hand.) However, they&#x27;re good writing one episode at a time.

If you&#x27;re a web developer, talk about how the browser loads the HTML for the page, then pulls out the <link rel=stylesheet> tags and fetches CSS for them, then executes any <script> tags.  It sees a <form> tag, then an <input type=&quot;text&quot;>, and uses that to render the query box.  If you type and that and hit submit, it loads the page in the <form>&#x27;s action attribute.<p>If you&#x27;re a desktop software guy, talk about how Windows dispatches a WM_KEYDOWN event, which the browser&#x27;s event loop picks up.  It then initiates an HTTP request and renders Windows controls for every HTML element on the page.<p>If you&#x27;re a backend database guy, talk about how Google must run a query against a massively sharded database to look up the terms you just entered and fetch document URLs for each of them.  It then merges the query results to AND your query terms together, and return them.<p>Note that all of these answers are completely wrong (and basically the only way I could know this is because I worked on Google Search and actually know how it works).  Google.com inlines styles into a single <style> tag; there are no <link> stylesheets, because we found the latency of the HTTP request outweighs the cache savings.  I know less about how Windows works, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if under Windows7 and .NET the Win32 API is an emulation layer, and I know that most of the elements in modern browsers have no OS analogue and are rendered in shadow DOM via the browsers own box-and-painting mechanism.

Sorry for the confusion!<p>That&#x27;s an interesting idea, but are you sure that thermal expansion imparts enough force against 175 miles of steel in order to push it all the way to the station?  175 miles of steel would be incredibly heavy.  It seems like the heating/cooling might even cause the steel to weaken enough such that, rather than rolling the tube towards the station, it would start to scrunch like an accordion.  But I wish a structural physicist would step in with some calculations to prove whether or not 175 miles of steel on rollers could be pushed by thermal expansion without compromising hyperloop&#x27;s structural stability.<p>Maybe we could ask /r/askscience?<p>EDIT:  After re-reading your comment, I think you&#x27;re saying the rollers would actually provide the force necessary to move 175 miles of steel, rather than letting the expansion passively push it.  But those rollers would have to grip onto something in order to do that.  They wouldn&#x27;t be rollers so much as tank treads.<p>Hmm... Do you think that might work?  Could 175 electric motors working in unison provide enough force to tank treads that bite into the concrete pillar below, and into the steel tube above, in order to successfully shift 175 miles of steel?  And the system has to have temperature sensors every mile, and those sensors must not ever report incorrect readings or else the whole tube breaks.  And those motors must never break down or run out of power...<p>I&#x27;m sounding pessimistic, but honestly I have no idea whether that would work.<p>EDIT 2:  Ah, I think I&#x27;ve figured out why it can&#x27;t work.

It bends all along the route.  <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/3TavjCY.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/3TavjCY.png</a><p>So motorized rollers would actually need to bend the tube in order to successfully transmit the thermal expansion.  In other words, when a piece of steel tubing is initially created, it&#x27;s bent with a certain curvature.  But if rollers are to transmit the expansion all the way to the station, the exact location of <i>where</i> the steel is bent needs to be dynamically defined at runtime, rather than statically assigned at compile time.

AT&T has AWS spectrum in most markets, but it isn&#x27;t a 40MHz chunk.  That&#x27;s still additional capacity.  AT&T is also re-farming spectrum previously used for 2G/3G services for LTE.  Likewise, the 150Mbps theoretical speed won&#x27;t happen in real-world conditions (just as 10x10 LTE doesn&#x27;t give you 75Mbps speeds).  It will offer better speeds, but quoting theoretical speeds in wireless is somewhat useless.<p>Verizon is in a wonderful spectrum position.  The 40MHz chunks that Verizon has in many markets is great.  AT&T is going to have to do carrier aggregation and we&#x27;ll see how well carrier aggregation works vs. larger contiguous channels.  But overall Verizon doesn&#x27;t have too much more spectrum than AT&T.  If AT&T can pull off carrier aggregation well, there should be decent competition.  Even before AT&T started diving into small cell sites, the Cingular/ATTWS merger had left the company with more cell sites than Verizon.<p>Verizon was really smart when it came to LTE.  They knew that they could grab customers if they bought up the spectrum needed for LTE.  Spectrum is a limited good and if they had the most/best, it would give them a durable advantage that&#x27;s hard to compete against.  They bought the open-access 700MHz spectrum whose open-access restrictions seem to have been watered down and while AT&T was fighting to buy T-Mobile (which wouldn&#x27;t be approved because it would concentrate too many customers together and limit competition), Verizon bought the AWS spectrum from the cable companies which gave them a very powerful position to deploy LTE.<p>Verizon did very well with their LTE rollout, but AT&T covers the vast majority of their network.  The area that&#x27;s really different are the areas that AT&T never existed in prior to Verizon buying Alltel.<p>Verizon got a lot right, but definitely not 100% of the time.  The iPhone hit AT&T hard.  EDGE (2G GSM data) used a lot of spectrum for the original iPhone and put AT&T in the position of investing a lot in a dead technology.  If you were Verizon with the knowledge we have today and had the opportunity to grab exclusivity on a 2G iPhone that would have you investing in 2G capacity (and using up your spectrum for several years), would you do it?  I think they&#x27;d probably say yes.  Ultimately, I think AT&T wishes the iPhone had come out a year later with 3G.  The 2G iPhone put AT&T in the crappy position of using up a lot of spectrum that could have gone to 3G and requiring a lot of investment in 2G that could have gone to 3G.  But it also really helped gain customers.<p>Sprint was a sad situation.  They wanted to outsource their 4G network to Clearwire.  You can&#x27;t outsource your core competency.  Sprint starved Clearwire of funds which meant that an aggressive network buildout just wasn&#x27;t possible.  Clearwire&#x27;s high-frequency spectrum meant that a very large number of cell sites would be needed to cover an area.  By contrast, AT&T and Verizon&#x27;s 700MHz spectrum means that they can roll out fast and then add cell sites for capacity as needed.  Sprint/Clearwire didn&#x27;t have that option.  I think Sprint was genuinely worried that if Clearwire succeeded, Sprint would become nothing more than a Clearwire MVNO.<p>Sprint lost a lot of time.  It didn&#x27;t want to fund Clearwire.  Then it thought it was going to buy LightSquared&#x27;s spectrum and dump Clearwire.  Then Clearwire was going to build TD-LTE for Sprint.  Then Sprint was going to build 5x5 LTE on their PCS spectrum.  Then Sprint was getting bought and buying Clearwire.  Then Dish started competing for Clearwire.  This is just years of wasted time on direction.<p>I think Spark is moving slowly because it&#x27;s hard to roll out such a high-frequency network in such a low-density country.  On top of that, I think the permitting/approval process and the ability to get fiber to so many points was underestimated.  SoftBank (majority owner of Sprint) has said that they deploy a ton of cell sites in Japan on the same high frequencies and get fiber to them all.  But Sprint has been complaining of getting fiber and a lot of locations make it hard to build lots of cell sites.<p>But Sprint is doing a lot better recently.  They&#x27;re deploying 5x5 LTE on their 800 and 1900MHz spectrum.  It doesn&#x27;t have the capacity that the other three have, but it&#x27;s a much better situation than a year ago.  And Sprint is gaining customers (about 1M last quarter, though post-pay subscribers were flat).  Sprint seems to be in the kind of position that T-Mobile was a year and a half ago and I think that bodes well for competition in the future.  Sprint&#x27;s 800MHz spectrum should offer good coverage and reliability for their LTE network.  Their 2.5GHz spectrum could help with capacity and speed in cities.  Their new CEO seems to price wisely and aggressively.  I think Sprint is in a stable point today.  Their network is a bit slower, but the difference between 8Mbps and 12Mbps or 12Mbps and 18Mbps isn&#x27;t as relevant as the gap from 2Mbps to 10Mbps that was often the case.<p>I think 2015 will see a more competitive wireless landscape than we&#x27;ve seen in a long time.  T-Mobile is draining customers from competitors and has announced bold intentions for coverage.  Sprint is pricing aggressively and has a network that is reasonable and will hopefully get a lot better.  The auction for 600MHz spectrum might be happening this year and might have rules favoring companies not named AT&T and Verizon.  Two years ago, Verizon and AT&T had LTE while Sprint and T-Mobile languished.  Today, the vast majority of Americans have four carriers that would service them well.  Some might be better than others in different locations or for different purposes, but it&#x27;s a huge difference from the era when we were wondering if T-Mobile would even launch LTE and when Sprint completely lacked direction.",1421455003

8902739,comment,8901983,8901983,0,0,bane,,,"Lots of people make the mistake of thinking there&#x27;s only two vectors you can go to improve performance, high or wide.<p>High - throw hardware at the problem, on a single machine<p>Wide - Add more machines<p>There&#x27;s a third direction you can go, I call it &quot;going deep&quot;. Today&#x27;s programs run on software stacks so high and so abstract that we&#x27;re just now getting around to redeveloping (again for like the 3rd or 4th time) software that performs about as well as software we had around in the <i>1990s and early 2000s</i>.<p>Going deep means stripping away this nonsense and getting down closer to the metal, using smart algorithms, planning and working through a problem and seeing if you can size the solution to running on one machine as-is. Modern CPUs, memory and disk (especially SSDs) are unbelievably fast compared to what we had at the turn of the millenium, yet we treat them like they&#x27;re spare capacity to soak up even lazier abstractions. We keep thinking that completing the task means successfully scaling out a complex network of compute nodes, but completing the task <i>actually</i> means processing the data and getting meaningful results in a reasonable amount of time.<p>This isn&#x27;t really hard to do (but it can be tedious), and it doesn&#x27;t mean writing system-level C or ASM code. Just seeing what you can do on a single medium-specc&#x27;d consumer machine <i>first</i>, then scaling up or out if you <i>really</i> need to. It turns out a great many problems really don&#x27;t need scalable compute clusters. And in fact, the time you&#x27;d spend setting that up, and building the coordinating code (which introduces yet more layers that soak up performance) you&#x27;d probably be better off just spending the same time to do on a single machine.<p>Bonus, if your problem gets too big for a single machine (it happens), there might be trivial parallelism in the problem you can exploit and now going-wide means you&#x27;ll probably outperform your original design anyways and the coordination code is likely to be much simpler and less performance degrading. Or you can go-high and toss more machine at it and get more gains with zero planning or effort outside of copying your code and the data to the new machine and plugging it in.<p>Oh yeah, many of us, especially experienced people or those with lots of school time, are taught to overgeneralize our approaches. It turns out many big compute problems are just big one-off problems and don&#x27;t need a generalized approach. Survey your data, plan around it, and then write your solution as a specialized approach just for the problem you have. It&#x27;ll likely run much faster this way.<p>Some anecdotes:<p>- I wrote an NLP tool that, on a single spare desktop with no exotic hardware, was 30x faster than a 6-high-end-system-distributed-compute-node that was doing a comparable task. That group eventually used my solution with a go-high approach and runs it on a big multi-core system with as fast of memory and SSD as they could procure and it&#x27;s about 5 times faster than my original code. My code was in Perl, the distributed system it competed against was C++. The difference was the algorithm I was using, and not overgeneralizing the problem. Because my code could complete their task in 12 hours instead of 2 weeks, it meant they could iterate every day. A 14:1 iteration opportunity made a huge difference in their workflow and within weeks they were further ahead than they had been after 2 years of sustained work. Later they ported my code to C++ and realized even further gains. They&#x27;ve never had to even think about distributed systems. As hardware gets faster, they simply copy the code and data over and realize the gains and it performs faster than they can analyze the results.<p>Every vendor that&#x27;s come in after that has been forced to demonstrate that their distributed solution is faster than the one they already have running in house. Nobody&#x27;s been able to demonstrate a faster system to-date. It has saved them literally tens of millions of dollars in hardware, facility and staffing costs over the last half-decade.<p>- Another group had a large graph they needed to conduct a specific kind of analysis on. They had a massive distributed system that handled the graph, it was about 4 petabytes in size. The analysis they wanted to do was an O(N^2) analysis, each node needed to be compared potentially against each other node. So they naively set up some code to do the task and had all kinds of exotic data stores and specialized indexes they were using against the code. Huge amounts of data was flying around their network trying to run this task but it was slower than expected.<p>An analysis of the problem showed that if you segmented the data in some fairly simple ways, you could skip all the drama and do each slice of the task without much fuss on a single desktop. O(n^2) isn&#x27;t terrible if your data is small. O(k+n^2) isn&#x27;t much worse if you can find parallelism in your task and spread it out easily.<p>I had a 4 year old Dell consumer level desktop to use so I wrote the code and ran the task. Using not much more than Perl and SQLite I was able to compute a large-ish slice of a few GB in a couple hours. Some analysis of my code showed I could actually perform the analysis on insert in the DB and that the size was small enough to fit into memory so I set SQLite to :memory: and finished it in 30 minutes or so. That problem solved, the rest was pretty embarrassingly parallel and in short order we had a dozen of these spare desktops occupied running the same code on different data slices and finishing the task 2 orders of magnitude than what their previous approach had been. Some more coordinating code and the system was fully automated. A single budget machine was theoretically now capable of doing the entire task in 2 months of sustained compute time. A dozen budget machines finished it all in a week and a half. Their original estimate on their old distributed approach was 6-8 months with a warehouse full of machines, most of which would have been computing things that resulted in a bunch of nothing.<p>To my knowledge they still use a version of the original Perl code with SQlite running in memory without complaint. They could speed things up more with a better in-memory system and a quick code port, but why bother? It&#x27;s completing the task faster than they can feed it data as the data set is only growing a few GB a day. Easily enough for a single machine to handle.<p>- Another group was struggling with handling a large semantic graph and performing a specific kind of query on the graph while walking it. It was ~100 million entities, but they needed interactive-speed query returns. They had built some kind of distributed Titan cluster (obviously a premature optimization).<p>Solution, convert the graph to an adjacency matrix and stuff it in a PostgreSQL table, build some indexes and rework the problem as a clever dynamically generated SQL query (again, Perl) and now they were realizing .01second returns, fast enough for interactivity. Bonus, the dataset at 100m rows was tiny, only about 5GB, with a maximum table-size of 32TB and diskspace cheap they were set for the conceivable future. Now administration was easy, performance could be trivially improved with an SSD and some RAM and they could trivially scale to a point where dealing with Titan was far into their future.<p>Plus, there&#x27;s a chance for PostgreSQL to start supporting proper scalability soon putting that day even further off.<p>- Finally, a e-commerce company I worked with was building a dashboard reporting system that ran every night and took all of their sales data and generated various kinds of reports, by SKU, by certain number of days in the past, etc. It was taking 10 hours to run on a 4 machine cluster.<p>A dive in the code showed that they were storing the data in a deeply nested data structure for computation and building and destroying that structure as the computation progressed was taking all the time. Furthermore, some metrics on the reports showed that the most expensive to compute reports were simply not being used, or were being viewed only once a quarter or once a year around the fiscal year. And cheap to compute reports, where there were millions of reports being pre-computed, only had a small percentage actually being viewed.<p>The data structure was built on dictionaries pointing to other dictionaries and so-on. A quick swap to arrays pointing to arrays (and some dictionary<->index conversion functions so we didn&#x27;t blow up the internal logic) transformed the entire thing. Instead of 10 hours, it ran in about 30 minutes, on a single machine. Where memory was running out and crashing the system, memory now never went above 20% utilization. It turns out allocating and deallocating RAM actually takes time and switching a smaller, simpler data structure makes things faster.<p>We changed some of the cheap to compute reports from being pre-computed to being compute-on-demand, which further removed stuff that needed to run at night. And then the infrequent reports were put on a quarterly and yearly schedule so they only ran right before they were needed instead of every night. This improved performance even further and as far as I know, 10 years later, even with huge increases in data volume, they never even had to touch the code or change the ancient hardware it was running on.<p>It seems ridiculous sometimes, seeing these problems in retrospect, that the idea was that to make these problems solvable racks in a data center, or entire data centeres were ever seriously considered seems insane. A single machine&#x27;s worth of hardware we have today is almost embarrassingly powerful. Here&#x27;s a machine that for $1k can break 11 <i>TFLOPS</i> [1]. That&#x27;s insane.<p>It also turns out that most of our problems are not compute speed, throwing more CPUs at a problem don&#x27;t really improve things, but disk and memory are a problem. Why anybody would think shuttling data over a network to other nodes, where we then exacerbate every I/O problem would improve things is beyond me. Getting data across a network and into a CPU that&#x27;s sitting idle 99% of the time is not going to improve your performance.<p>Analyze your problem, walk through it, figure out where the bottlenecks are and fix those. It&#x27;s likely you won&#x27;t have to scale to many machines for most problems.<p>I&#x27;m almost thinking of coming up with a statement: Bane&#x27;s rule, you don&#x27;t understand a distributed computing problem until you can get it to fit on a single machine first.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.freezepage.com/1420850340WGSMHXRBLE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freezepage.com/1420850340WGSMHXRBLE</a>",1421454912

And I wish HN had a private messaging system so that I could&#x27;ve mentioned that in private.<p>For a sense of scale, 60 mph travels one mile in 60 seconds, or 0.016 miles per second.  Hyperloop goes 760 mph, which is 0.211 miles per second.  (Jeez, that&#x27;s fast.)  So it only takes about 10 seconds for the car to traverse 2 miles, or in other words to traverse whatever effect such a motorized roller would have on the path of the vehicle.  Like, if the roller causes the track to move &quot;outwards,&quot; for example toward the ocean, by a little bit, then the pod is going to move &quot;a little bit toward the ocean and then back&quot; in 10 seconds.<p>That seems like it might be reasonable.  But I suppose the question is whether a 7,700 lb pod travelling at 760 mph can tolerate, say, a 2-meter deviation in its trajectory in 10 seconds.  Meaning, one meter toward the ocean, and then one meter back towards its original course.  Can the pod bank against the walls by a displacement of 0.2m per second?  If you hold out your arms to the length of a meter, 0.2m is pretty small, but it&#x27;s not <i>too</i> small.  And the pod would be going sideways by that amount per second.<p>1-meter deviation due to thermal expansion is extreme.  0.25m per mile might be a more realistic deviation.  So that would be a 1-meter deviation total: 0.5m toward the ocean, then 0.5m back, which would still mean the pod needs to scrape against the inner wall by 0.1m per second.<p>I wonder what the limits on the banking are...",1421454646

The relentless, unceasing portrayal of sexualized women characters sends the message that the value of women is in their sexuality -- not their intelligence, their emotional perceptiveness, their leadership qualities, or any of hundreds of other positive attributes I could name and that women, like men, possess in varying degrees.  That drumbeat -- inescapably present in American culture as well as Japanese -- is heard clearly by both girls and boys, and shapes their attitudes about gender roles.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to play cultural superiority here.

However when I got to college, I found programming monotonous and boring. When I worked as a software engineer for a large boring company I hated it even more. To the point that I actually quit and switched careers.<p>Then, a few years later I discovered Ruby on Rails and development on a new Mac. These seemingly small changes to a new environment rekindled my love of computers to a point that I spent nearly every weekend for three years teaching myself Rails. I remember one weekend I flew to a bachelor party in New Orleans and all the way there I read a book on Rails. It wasn&#x27;t work anymore, but a hobby that I truly loved.<p>This is not to say that everyone is cut out to be or will enjoy being a programmer with just the right tools. However I think a lot of people take a first glance at something and give up on it without having a comprehensive understanding of the reality of doing the work in an ideal environment. To this day it annoys the hell out of me when non-technical friends ask me questions about coding as if it is some awful task that has to be done- &quot;Why would you ever want to do that?&quot; These people never actually have tried it so they don&#x27;t know what is actually involved or whether they might actually enjoy it.",1421453761

The power loading (power divided by surface of the propeller&#x27;s circle) is the key factor what matters for efficiency (until of course Reynolds number - air viscosity factor - starts to change - happens when we come to Kolibri scale)<p>In general, helicopter with 3m long blades (6m diameter) on one 500kw turbine or something like 16 of 30kw motors with 1.5m diameter propeller (with the same number of blades as helicopter) each is pretty much equivalent. That is pretty theoretical starting point. After that we can optimize these systems in different ways. 16-copter allows to use somewhat bigger, yet less-bladed, like 2-3 bladed propellers which are more efficient than multi-blades of helicopter (and you can&#x27;t really have 2 bladed rotor on helicopter). You can use ducts on 1.5m propellers - not a case for helicopter. So all this allows to increase efficiency.",1421453611

It does not require lawsuits.<p>So arguably, just by posting a blog post that says facebook&#x27;s patent is invalid, you&#x27;d lose rights, because that is an assertion that a right in a patent of facebook&#x27;s is invalid.<p>If it&#x27;s not meant to cover this, it&#x27;s not at all clear what the difference between &quot;an assertion&quot; and &quot;a lawsuit&quot; are supposed to be in the examples, or what &quot;other action&quot; would constitute.",1421452965

I love it because anyone with expertise in any part of the system should be able to answer it. Are you a networking guru? If so, you should be able to talk a long time about the network bits. Are you a kernel guru? Same. Etc. It also gives me a good idea how broad the interviewee is.<p>It is always amazing to me how many people fail the question so badly. I&#x27;ve really had only one person answer it reasonably in all these years.",1421452909

Imagine heating 1 mile of hyperloop by 11C, but only 1 mile.  The result is 0.25m more steel that has to go somewhere.<p>Can that expansion really be pushed 175 miles north and 175 miles south simultaneously?<p>I&#x27;m not going to say that&#x27;s impossible, because I&#x27;d imagine someone having similar objections to, say, the invention of A/C current.  &quot;Can pushing electrons back and forth really propagate thousands of miles?&quot;<p>But if you visualize the implications of that, it&#x27;s intuitively difficult to believe the expansion can be transmitted to the endpoints across the entire length of a solid steel tube 175 miles away.  That would move an incredible amount of mass.  Surely at some point the weight of the tube overcomes the steel&#x27;s desire to expand, so the result would be the tube either scrunching up like an accordion or going in the lateral direction.<p>(Jacques said sleeves could be the solution so that thermal expansion can&#x27;t accumulate, but it seems like sleeves would introduce problems for the pod, possibly severe ones.  When a pod travels over a sleeve, it would feel like a jolt, if I&#x27;m understanding his idea of &quot;sleeves&quot; correctly.)<p>I&#x27;m so happy someone is actually engaging with the comment and tossing ideas around with me though.",1421452870

A sentence like this<p>> Dark matter comprises most of the mass of a galaxy.<p>means just about nothing. It reminds me of when Richard Feynman was ranting about the science textbook with &quot;energy makes it go&quot; as the answer to some questions, and saying that you could just as easily substitute the word &quot;wakalixes&quot; and it would communicate exactly the same amount of information. Dark Matter is the popular name for a variable in some models of how fast galaxies of different sizes rotate. The current definition basically goes &quot;maybe there is a lot of extra mass that we can&#x27;t see and somehow doesn&#x27;t interact with the visible matter in other ways.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a very sophisticated hypothesis and a lot of smart people have good reason to support it, but that&#x27;s what it is. Why condescend to the general public by pretending that Dark Matter is some well-defined observable thing that scientists are simply trying to measure, instead of a proposed explanation for observations that we don&#x27;t understand yet?<p>Maybe it helps get funding, I don&#x27;t know. This experiment looks neat because they&#x27;re having a go at falsifying one model.",1421452829

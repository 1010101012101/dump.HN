Did I suggest limiting anyone's success or taking exorbitant amounts of money through taxes?""<p>No, but I'm waiting for it.<p>""The problem is that ""coming out on top"" now means you control a hugely disproportionate sum of wealth""<p>...that you've earned.  I don't see a problem.<p>""and thereby exert a disproportionate influence on society, invariably to the expense of others.""<p>Then let's not allow people with money to set the rules.  Capitalism isn't the problem.  It's corrupt politicians that take kickbacks.  I would also like to mention that money is power.  In any time in history, the more money you have, the more power you possess.  It will always be the case.  If not money, then whatever currency we are using.  It's not like you can't go out and earn your own.<p>""And therein lies one of the problems - the rewards do not go to those who make the wealth, and that's exactly the point the author of the article was making.""<p>You can't make a blanket statement like this, because it's not true in most cases.  When the guy in the article was working as a ""Jack-in-the-Box counterperson"", what was he willing to risk all of his time and money to run the business?  It sounds to me like he wants the same amount of profits as an owner, but none of the risks.<p>As I've stated earlier, I don't think people would really like it if companies were allowed to hire people at no pay, work them day and night for the hope that they will make a profit (which is what it takes as an owner).  Just ask anyone here that is trying to start a company.  You might make it big, but you will probably fail many more times before you succeed.<p>Most people want a comfort blanket.  They don't want to have to worry about profit margins.  They want to know that they will get paid every month.<p>""If an engineer invents a radical new process for fabricating microchips, who is paid the huge sum of money resulting from it - the CEO or the engineer? Which one actually created wealth and value?""<p>If the engineer is under contract and using the resources, money, and lab of his employer to create this radical new process, he is getting paid a salary he agreed upon (which wasn't by force).  If he is using all of his own equipment, under no contract, it can make him very rich.  I don't really see a problem with anything you are describing, except your sense of entitlement.<p>""This is merely condescension. Age doesn't grant you any magical insights, and you don't have to reach a certain age to know there are no new ideas. I figured that out a long time ago. That said, you want to talk about defeatists attitudes? ""There are no new ideas"" is a cake taker in that department.""<p>Do you actually think I believe there isn't anything new?  I was merely pointing out that there are thousands of years of history and experience in the economic, finance, and politics department, which can show you what works and what doesn't (and if your idea is radically new or just a rehash of something old).<p>Age can grant you insight, if you learn from history and your experiences.<p>Ponzi schemes are a good example of this.  They will always fail in the end, yet people continue to fall for them.<p>""I don't have all the answers, and I don't claim to - but we have absolutely zero chance of addressing social issues if we as a society won't even acknowledge them. And just because I don't have a better alternative right now, doesn't mean that no one else does either - or that I won't in the future.""<p>There are more important social issues to address than some guy that is whining about his life.",1299120749

In addition, a big part of the funding discussion is timeline to revenues, which is just completely ignored at this stage in the valley.<p>-- Given this higher bar, the startups that do rise in the Boston ecosystem are of generally higher quality. I was at the launch conference last week, and several companies in the demo pit were honestly just ""me-too"" class projects. GreenGoose (at Launch) was an example of a Boston startup.<p>-- Nonethless for consumer web/mobile, Boston startups tend to be inferior to the valley ones. The reasons for this are multifold. (a) The angel/adviser community seems less comfortable funding companies that don't have a clear path to revenues. (b) The entrepreneurs themselves are not the best at designing products / UX etc. (c) The better Boston consumer web/mobile companies move west anyways<p>-- Given the less ""bubble"" ness in Boston, hiring top-notch engineers from MIT, Harvard, Olin or other good technical schools is a real option for startups.

Five families can band together to trade off on who is watching what on what days and share questions and answers, or a day care organization can use it to bootstrap themselves into an affordable private school. Online companies can bootstrap into having banks of problems, using that as the content.

2282483,story,,,19,11,DudeWithPriorIP,"Advice from HN: I'm about to be fired because I declared prior IP months ago.",,"Quick backstory:\nI'm very interested in a particular niche of the tech sector. I studied it in school. Did research on it. Have a very promising (but unlaunched) side-project in the field.<p>I'm also recently employed by a prominent company in the field. Talking about my experience in the field is what got me the job.<p>Several months ago, when I signed on, I got the standard ""list your prior IP"" form. I listed my side-project IP. I got the ""I'll have to clear this with some people..."" response from HR, then heard nothing. 3+ months pass, until this week. Seems we have a problem.<p>From what I've heard, there are two issues:<p>1. Due diligence of an acquiring company would find the simple act of me having this IP ""too risky."" IDK why, as I'm not claiming any of the company IP and the contract stipulates that if I inject my IP into their business they are granted a perpetual non-exclusive license. Seems fine to me to simply list it.<p>2. If I were to develop this product, it could theoretically compete with the company's product. It would only do this under the broadest sense of the field we're in. I can kind of understand this. They are still worried though, regardless of if I actually develop the product, that my simply having the IP makes this too risky. Seems as if they WILL NOT have me with the IP listed, regardless of non-compete clauses or whatever.<p>So, my options or potential outcomes as I see them:<p>Don't list my prior IP on the paper, keep my job. (This isn't the company's stance, but I assume I would retain claim to the IP via my papertrail of work from well before I started the job if I really need to prove it eventually).<p>List the prior IP, they ""don't hire me"" (despite me having worked there for months) and I'm de facto fired/quit.<p>List the IP, pitch them in the meeting, and have them acquire the IP. Work for the company to develop the product. (This would be an extremely unlikely scenario, don't even want to think about terms right now).<p>Somehow convince them that the product is far enough away from their product that it isn't a conflict. It sounds as if this will be unlikely as well.<p>Eff, this sucks. How do any companies expect to acquire domain experts without some prior IP baggage they've picked up along the way?<p>Someone talk me through it. Like I said, I love the field. I love the company. I love my side-project. Can't I just keep doing it all? :(",1299119848

This is easy to implement but it causes loss of (potentially unrelated) changes that one person made.<p>Locking (pessimistic and optimistic) tries to make the above better because it either prevents divergence or prevents changes from being lost by returning an error (refusing to commit the conflict-inducing change to one of the data stores.)<p>Merge is the hardest of all, and it is a series of trade-offs and compromises.  From diff-match-patch to three way merge to operational transformation, vector clocks and so on, there are many ways to try and handle merging that all have their own ups and downs.  (google the iterating bigrams in that sentence for more info.). You ultimately need to get your own application logic in the merge process -- for instance, ""we want to disallow changes to the title After the PDF has been sent"" is a business rule, but then your remote client had changed the title while disconnected and somebody else sent the PDF.  There is no simple algo that will handle text merging, state machine guards, and varying merge strategies.

In order to change salaries, legislation is required. In order to enact legislation, you have to form special interest groups (in this case unions) to represent large swaths of voters, as politicians only listen to votes.<p>Instead, consider the idea of eliminating public school. With all of the money back in the public's pockets instead of in government coffers, the public could choose to fund education in a manner that each individual sees fit. However, the common argument (and legitimate concern) is that poor people would be left out. Poor parents who don't have the money to send their kids to school, let alone GOOD school, are left raising uneducated kids who then end up poor. The idea that charity would solve this problem is not entirely unreasonable, but it seems to be a cop out.<p>This is where I think the Khan Academy has the potential to have a major impact. With individual teachers teaching small classes, you're required to have many hundreds of thousands of teachers across the country, leading to an extremely high production cost for education. If instead you have groups like the Khan Academy producing educational materials that are easy to consume, available across a huge breadth and depth of topics and easy to distribute, the production costs for education go way down.<p>The reason that poor people can't afford private school is because private schools are expensive. Using technology allows organizations like the Khan Academy to produce high quality education at a fraction of the cost. I'd love to see private schools set up to take advantage of this material and educate the public without government involvement and its requisite politician silliness.",1299118917

2282411,comment,2281966,2281966,0,0,shaggy,,,"As pointed out already, there is a thriving startup scene in the Boston area. I think some of the ""knocks"" Vivek Wadhwa makes about SV being ""more failure-cherishing, more risk-taking, better capitalised"" are either not good things or not really true. First off more failure-cherishing winds up meaning that more VC money is essentially wasted by people building things that have no business model or aren't even remotely useful. Failure isn't always a bad thing, but I wouldn't pride myself or the community I'm part of on being happy to fail. Second more risk-taking means the same enourmous sums of VC money wasted and it also means, in my opinion, that people are willing to overlook or can't see glaring issues with proposed businesses and invest anyway. Lastly, there are a large number of VCs here in the Boston area and I don't see that changing anytime soon.<p>Three other points. One, if Boston were so bad for the startup scene or tech in general then why is basically every big player here? Microsoft, google, vmware, akamai, IBM, cisco, juniper, emc, netapp, the list goes on. These companies aren't here because there isn't any talent or it's a bad place to be. Two, many of the companies on the list are companies that have been around for a while and are thriving, profitable and growing on their own. Last, and as has been pointed out, there is a <i>huge</i> biotech scene here, as well as a large amount of government/defense research related work (irobot, raytheon, mit, boston dynamics).",1299118600

I'm including all the variants, including markdown and creole and MediaWiki syntax.<p>Wiki markup exists to bridge the gap between textareas and fully formatted pages. It was a great idea in 2001-2004 or so. We have decent HTML editors now.<p>Wiki markup makes it difficult for non-geeks to contribute. Wiki markup is non-WYSIWYG, slowing every edit down with some 'parse' or 'compile' cycle. At some point you will have to allow raw HTML and JavaScript to be embedded within it, and then you have the various nightmares that ensue from context-dependent errors in parsing, output, or even security.<p>There are a few benefits that markup provides over a decent HTML editor - certain changes can be more semantic, and it's easier to diff. As for semantic changes, I would suggest making up your own tags and attributes, as HTML has always allowed, and expanding them as needed to the desired target formats. As for diffs, this is harder, but some focused attention to the problem could solve it. And diffs have their own usability issues anyway; they are barely readable for computer languages.

Even with a reasonable amount of intake, variability in protein consumption can result in measurable health consequences in specific conditions. This said, dietary protein delivers more than energy and building blocks to the human body: The pools of body, tissue, and cell proteins, peptides, and amino acids are under complex metabolic control, resulting in a highly dynamic protein turnover, that is, the interplay between synthesis and degradation. Proteins also contain peptide sequences that can be interpreted as bioactive precursors which can be liberated upon digestion to exert biological functions locally (e.g., in the gut) or systemically (i.e., via the bloodstream).<p>This would be fascinating, if the Rhinehart quote had had anything to do with it.<p>Amusingly, my own reaction is exactly that of the single comment:<p>> I started the article wholly on the nutritionist's side and ended up dismayed by her reliance on snark over reasoning. If this green frothy diet is nutritionally flawed, it ought to be downright easy for a professional nutritionist to explain why, so Metsovas' reliance on insults and vague generalities ends up trivializing her position and setting up Rhinehart to be the misunderstood genius. Nonetheless, I'm going home to COOK dinner that I will actually CHEW. But I don't feel right now that I'm in particularly good company, if Metsovas is on my side.<p>Indeed. With friends like these, who needs enemies? I still prefer to let Rhinehart treat himself as a guinea pig, but it's hard to remember this when I see such sneering idiotic contempt & rhetoric passing for informed commentary.",1367017220

I consider it one of the most interesting and rewarding things I've done in my career. All obstacles were removed, we could follow the clues wherever they took us, use any resources etc. In the end it took careful analysis, many simulations and hard work to find and fix the root cause, and no fingers were pointed, instead we learned some good lessons and were better for it.<p>When done right, RCA is a great thing.",1340992771

We're still trying to figure out what we need from a JS framework, and we haven't figured out the balance to be good enough for everyone. Backbone is minimalist, ember is opinionated, knockout and angular have solutions that look really good for the enterprise and a particular subset of apps, and a few others trying out interesting new ideas.<p>This is really the second generation of JS frameworks, and there's likely a third one coming up that will consolidate the best ideas we've found so far with more batteries included.

After all, human language is inconsistent. After awhile you just get used to it and don't think about it anymore. Programming languages are no different.<p>I agree with Marco that it will take ""years to master"" whatever he chooses next. I always scratch my head at these ""I learnt Python in a day"" claims you often see around here. No, you didn't learn Python in a day. You learnt the syntax for a for loop in a day. Idiomatic Python takes much longer.<p>I don't agree that choice is the reason people don't use Linux on the desktop. Desktop Linux is the reason people don't use Linux on the desktop. I'm sorry but it's truly awful and probably won't ever get better. In the absence of product direction you have us geeks making everything configurable because, you never know, you may want to write your own window manager (and knowing us geeks, no two will agree on what's right) so you have no consistency, no grand UI/UX design and it's just terrible.<p>I use Linux/Ubuntu at work basically because I have to. There are advantages on having your dev environment mirror your production environment and Linux (over OSX) does actually have a package system (it's a messy hack on OSX) but I certainly don't like it.<p>The only computers I use that I truly enjoy using are my iPad and my Macbook Air.<p>Fear of the wrong choice isn't I believe what motivates most people. Fear of looking like an idiot? Sure. But that's different and will probably be the case with anything new.<p>People don't tend to weight up two or more options, decide which is best and go with it. They tend to use the first thing they come across until its flaws (perceived or actual) outweigh the ""cost"" of transition and appearing like an idiot for awhile.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-de...</a>",1340992719

This means that running a Sentinel is basically for free, you can put one everywhere.<p>It is written in C as a ""sentinel.c"" module of Redis. In fact you can think at Redis itself as a framework to write event-driven services. So there was a lot of code reuse.<p>At the same time being every Sentinel a Redis instance, it understands the Redis protocol (but a different set of commands) and you can query every Sentinel for the full state. Or subscribe to a channel to get events that are happening using Redis Pub/Sub primitives (events like: this master is down, or it was failed over, use that instance instead).<p>This are a few of the reasons I designed and I'm building a new system.<p>Currently I'm at 50% of the work after few weeks of work, but actually a lot was done in the latest 10 days (before there was still too much 2.6 work).

4177966,comment,4177172,4177172,1,0,zaptheimpaler,,,"I think the simple problem with PHP is that its dated. Regardless of whether the language has serious flaws or not, the fact is that it takes a lot more effort and code to do the same things that new web frameworks let you do with a few lines of code. PHP is a great way to learn the basics because it doesn't have quite as many abstractions but that leads to slower development times, and plain bad code (insecure) if the dev doesn't know what hes doing. By the way, I'm referring to slower development times for decent size projects, not quite ""hello world"" (Honestly, even ""hello world"" would just be an HTML page and a route in django or RoR - 2 lines vs 1).<p>So if I was operating in the capacity of a recruiter for a project/company/startup, I'd definitely pick a skilled RoR dev over a skilled PHP dev, because the frameworks and the language themselves are handicaps for the PHP dev. Even if PHP is faster for a very small project, as soon as you move into a decent sized project, the frameworks start paying handsome returns for using them.<p>Note: I don't particularly love RoR/Django.

In fact, you could say it's a technology's <i>popularity</i> that fools you into ignoring many of the objective qualities of the platform.<p>I think part of tech hipsterism (which, let's face it, is what you're talking about) is a rejection of this groupthink, and a return to true technological thinking. It's the ability to say ""we don't care what's popular, we're just going to look at what works again and see where we end up."" I think this very idea is considered 'cool' in the tech world because we tend to like people who think logically about their problems and don't just blindly follow what people have already done. We like people who look at lesser-used technologies (which all of the ""cool"" tech you listed above actually are) just on their technical merits alone. This is, perhaps, one reason they're considered cool; because it takes actual thought to break away from simply using what everyone else has used for years.<p>So I think you have noticed a definite trend, but I don't believe it's as purely social as you imply.<p>That said, ""be aware that the future welfare of your family is relying on your decisions"" is an argument that's used in so much Enterprise software that it's almost scary. Often the most popular, most entrenched, least risky, biggest company with the largest pockets wins because the CTO can't be blamed for fucking up <i>that</i> decision. It's an incredible driver of technological stagnation in the Enterprise world. It is great to think through your decisions to their far-reaching impact, but be thankful that all of technology is not driven by that kind of strictness, or we'd never use anything new.",1340992021

You also get quite a bit of thermal radiation which heat up the air before it feels the physical effects from the craft.  So, while the pressure does increase the actual pressure never get's all that high despite the huge increase in temperature.  For a sanity check if you assume the energy of the air starts at the equivalent of ~30c at 1ATM and 1ATM = ~15lb/square inch then pressure required to get anywhere close to the observed temperatures get's ridiculous as in 100's of g's of deceleration.<p>Also, the blunt surface in front of a hyper-sonic aircraft collects a pressure wave off the surface.  With the air next to the skin moving at the same relative speed as the craft.  So the friction heating precedes the craft, and is negligible right next to it.  The aircraft is also cooling the air next to it which is what creates the cooler buffer zone.  (This is why they use blunt surfaces in the first place.)",1340991972

It takes a test function and returns true if any of the items pass that test.<p>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].any? {|i| i > 4 }  # true<p>Ok, you just learned `any?`. Now, you can replace `any?` in the above with<p>1) `all?` - do all elements pass?
2) `one?` - does exactly one pass?
3) `none?` - do none pass?<p>If you can remember one of those, chances are you can remember others. And if not, `myarray.methods` will remind you.<p>That same array has a `max` method and a `min`, a `max_by` and a `min_by`.

Guido doesn't really like FP - there's no tail recursion, either.<p>- Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities are a bit more powerful (haven't really looked at Python in this regard, so don't quote me).<p>- In fact, there are some pretty big syntax differences. Python requires brackets even for the print statement now, whereas Ruby lets you miss them out if it's unambiguous. Ruby has blocks.

And I know that removal of the GIL is not pragmatic at the moment (or maybe ever), but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be valuable.  The GIL wasn't much of a problem ten years ago because not many personal computers had multiple cores.  Today it's become a bit of a pain for me personally, and it will only become more painful as core count increases while single-core performance remains largely stagnant.<p><i>And all I was saying in this thread is that the performance gap between threads and processes isnt that big of a deal, if you run non-native code anyway. The multiprocessing module is pretty cool.</i><p>This is a line that I hear over and over again, but I strongly disagree with.  It's not always easy to predict where your performance bottlenecks will be until you actually start implementing it in some language.  If I've chosen Python for a project and find I need more cores, I'm stuck with either re-implementing critical sections of code in C extensions or other languages, or using multiprocessing.  And multiprocessing is not that great because it splits the memory space across processes and communication between them is extremely expensive.  And there are many caveats to this which cause enormous headaches (eg., you can't fork your process while having an active CUDA context, not all Python objects are serializable, pickling is slow, marshaling doesn't work well for all data types, you must finish dequeuing large objects from a multiprocessing.Queue before joining the source process, etc.).<p>Yes, I could get a 10-100x speedup by re-writing everything in C.

The only problem with Django and web2py is that they are monolithic.

With Flask and Bottle, on the other hand, you are free to pick and choose components. I think the same modular design approach is used by Pylons and Pyramid, but I'm not sure since I've never used them.

4177697,comment,4176075,4176780,1,0,kmavm,,,"The aspects of PHP that are bad (and there are more than a few) are easily tooled around. We have a review-time tool that parses your PHP, symbolically executes it, and looks for dubious idioms, flagging them for you and your reviewer.<p>Meanwhile, PHP gets a number of things very right. For instance:<p>* State: there is none across requests. Oh sure, there's APC, and the filesystem, and databases, etc., but those are all accessed via libraries. There is no PHP-level state that survives a request, which provides natural fault isolation: a request which goes wrong doesn't take the server down with it, or live on to corrupt other requests.<p>* Concurrency: PHP's concurrency model is the web request. If you want to run some code in parallel, curl to localhost. If you wrap an appropriate library around this, it looks just like Erlang's actors. This is shared-nothing concurrency, which turns out to be a compelling local maximum.<p>* Interactivity: The development workflow PHP provides is very productive. You save and load the page. You don't save, optionally recompile, restart the server, wait for it to initialize, forget what's different from the last three times you tried this because this has all taken three minutes and you forgot to write it down, etc.<p>These three things turn out to be among the most important parts of a server-side language, and PHP gets them very, very right. The rightness was accidental, not by design, but this doesn't make it any less right.<p>Also, the language itself can be improved. In the HipHop toolchain, -v Eval.EnableHipHopSyntax=true turns on a bunch of (backwards-compatible) features we've added to our PHP dialect, the most notable of which are XHP (syntax for using XML literals as PHP expressions) and generators (inspired by Python's, using similar 'yield' syntax).

4177663,comment,4177172,4177172,18,0,z92,,,"Here is another point that highlights the problem:<p>If I want to write a hello world application in PHP, it's neither as long as <?php print(""hello world"");?> nor as short as <?=""hello world""?><p>Rather it's simply: hello world. Just type in those 11 characters in a text file and save it as hello.php. Now load it on your browser [or run it from command line] and it will print hello world. I don't think it can get any more simpler than that in other languages. PHP was developed from the ground up as a templateting language for serving HTML pages. These other languages are more of a general type.<p>Therefore the replacement for PHP should come through a new language targeted as a replacement for PHP as Jeff said. Otherwise there always be extra web/template stacks for the developers to take care of. And that will be the first hurdle to learn and overcome for novice developers looking for switching to something easier.",1340989378
4177662,comment,4177172,4177172,0,0,mjackson,,,"The reason you describe your relationship with PHP as an ""addiction"" instead of using a word that described a more healthy relationship is probably because there is something about it that doesn't resonate well with your core values. At least that's the problem that I had with it.<p>If you want a nice introduction into the world of developing web apps with Python, I suggest you read the Flask user manual (see <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/</a>). It not only covers the basics of the framework, but also seems to assume that you're a first-time Python user as well. It covers topics such as using virtualenv and pip to setup your environment which I found very helpful when getting started with the language.",1340989375

There are certain things that are not their responsibility, but ensuring their customers don't get burned or shuffled through the hell that is PayPal claims seems a pretty obvious one that a competitor could beat them at.",1340989211

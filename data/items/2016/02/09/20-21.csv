But once you start writing software professionally that is for &quot;the enterprise&quot;, it&#x27;s important to understand the underlying stack. Knowing how your kernel&#x27;s plumbing of pipes actually works (for example) is invaluable in certain cases. Knowing how your framework&#x27;s black boxes work is very useful when you run into performance problems or find bugs. Yes, abstractions are good. But the higher you go up the stack of abstractions, the less you know about what&#x27;s actually happening and thus the less you&#x27;ll be able to do to actually debug it.<p>EDIT: Sorry, I didn&#x27;t read the OP.

Those bus delays in turn increase subway ridership, and overcrowding slows trains loading and unloading.<p>I think the issue is population growth not matching funding (or Albany robbing us).  I don&#x27;t doubt that this contributes, but I&#x27;d be surprised to see people switching from buses to subway being a leading cause of subway congestion.<p>> Although uber does probably deserve some of the blame t<p>Again this seems like a really small thing.  I doubt uber created many new taxis, so much as absorbed yellow/livery cabs.  I&#x27;m sure it has an effect but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the core issue.<p>> The answer is a congestion fee like Bloomberg wanted to put in.<p>100% agreed with the congestion fee, bummed it didn&#x27;t happen.<p>> That leaves the majority of Manhattan with spare subway capacity to move people around.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true.  One of the reasons the green line is so overcrowded is because so many people work on that line.  It&#x27;s not only about where people live.  If you put people next to the E, it doesn&#x27;t mean they only take the E.<p>> it is because of crowding on the Lexington line that I suggested densification should start at the south-west part of the neighborhood which has access to the sixth avenue line subways.<p>I agree that we should rezone and that the preservation stuff is a nightmare.",1455051393

It does point you in the right direction but when you meditate shortly on the meaning of the words &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;quantity&quot; I think you&#x27;re likely to conclude that the thesis &quot;The Key to Higher Quality is Higher Quantity&quot; can imply almost anything.<p>For a long time I&#x27;ve been an opponent to this mantra and in a way I still am.

That is: It is useless to think &quot;Oh this needs to be perfect&quot; or &quot;Oh this needn&#x27;t be perfect because some clever guy said so&quot; because in that instance you&#x27;ve already lost concentration and you are not really stretching your skills.

They look fantastic, perform great, and they don&#x27;t depend on a runtime environment.<p>Additionally, Free Pascal, the language it uses, includes events and properties, two core concepts important in creating desktop applications.<p>Properties are the nouns and adjectives which you place on objects or value types (structs). They allow you to have descriptive words associated with your types such as Color, Caption, and Width.<p>When you write:<p>Button.Color := Red;<p>The property setter is invoked causing code to execute invalidating the Button and refreshing the area of the screen occupied by Button. This is different than having a bunch of Button.SetColor(Red), Button.GetColor(), Button.SetCaption(Text), and Button.GetCaption().<p>Without properties what&#x27;s to say what nouns and verbs are important to the state and presentation of an object or value type? You just have a bunch of methods with nothing to distinguish them from properties as I&#x27;ve described.<p>Then there are methods, again something which Java is sorely missing. In Free Pascal they are their own intrinsic type.<p>Using an example again:<p>Button.OnClick := LoadFile;<p>We&#x27;ve associated some notification on Button with a handler method. Now how hard is that? Better yet, in Lazarus you can browse all the events an object supports and double click it assign a handler. The Java method of inner classes and interfaces results in a lot of unnecessary typing and code. It&#x27;s also antithetical to the concept of lambdas and closures, whereas in Lazarus they fit perfectly.",1455050678

I&#x27;ve asked various university physics professors, and they all stutter and disagree (which means either we really don&#x27;t know or I&#x27;m going to all the wrong universities).  The underlying question is:  When we say in general relativity that particles can&#x27;t travel faster than light, what is that speed measured relative to?<p>If it&#x27;s photons emitting from flashlights pointed in opposite directions relative to each other, then are they compressing space as they travel so as not to exceed the speed of light?  Or even massive particles accelerated to  over half the speed of light at different times around an ellipse so there is a moment when their opposite directions make one traveling at greater than the speed of light relative to the other?  (Or even particle accelerators on two different planets already expanding away from each other - does this just mean that space is really twisting and turning all the time to make sure no particle ever exceeds the speed of light relative to any other particle?)<p>It has been my understanding - and appreciation at Einstein&#x27;s unbelievable insight and brilliance - that relativity is truly relative because there really isn&#x27;t any such thing as an arbitrary particle or space that all other motions are measured from.  But if this is true, does that really mean that space is really so constantly twisting and turning that SOL can&#x27;t be exceeded?<p>I&#x27;m sure there are great answers to this, but I&#x27;ve always wanted a definitive one.

Sowell shows how this leads through basic logical deduction to left wing views.<p>On the other hand if you believe that human nature is essentially fixed, unchanging over time and flawed, then you assume that the span of human nature is not very large, and the gap between the best and the worst is not that big. This leads by logical deduction to right wing views.<p>So it&#x27;s perhaps not so much that right wing people are more &quot;afraid&quot; per se, but rather, that they tend to be quicker to assume that as there&#x27;s no way to fix &#x27;enemies&#x27; by raising their human nature to a higher level, you may as well put in place systems that protect society from them. Whereas people with more left wing views may tend to assume that you can in fact negotiate and debate people away from being your &#x27;enemies&#x27; and thus, they appear to be less fearful.<p>The above description makes left wing views sound superior to right wing views, which was not my intention.

If the client dies while processing the subtree, its lock is still persisted in shared memory alongs with the clientID. If another client tries to take the lock and it notices the client holding the lock has died, it takes the lock. \nWe used heartbeats to shared memroy to implement the failure detector for clients (based again on shared memory <a href=""http://www.jimdowling.info/sites/default/files/leader_election_using_newsql_db.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jimdowling.info/sites/default/files/leader_electi...</a> ).

The important point is that even in the extreme scenario where all stars last forever and you wait an infinite amount of time for light to reach you, you will still never see a fully illuminated sky because the stars are receding much faster than the light propagates due to metric expansion. Saying the sky is dark because 1) the Universe is young or 2) stars are short-lived is just false. The Universe gets darker and darker as it expands, despite there being &quot;more time for light to reach us&quot;.",1455048537

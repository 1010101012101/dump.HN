Needless to say - didn't work for long.<p>After a ton of experimenting, I found a system that works well for me. Short preface: I use my system to keep up with about 5 blogs where I want to read every post and then for all the articles I come upon via twitter and HN.<p>I use Read it Later to keep tabs on articles that I find on twitter + here on HN. Tweetbot lets you send to RIL directly from tweets and for HN, I use the Chrome extension, Aside.<p>For the blogs I follow, I use Reeder. If you find yourself with too much in here, do what I did: eliminate blogs that you don't read EVERY post for. You'll bring back the ones you miss.<p>In practice, it also helped me to just pick a trigger for reading through everything, my 'trigger' being after my run. This way, I set aside a certain amount of time to read through everything for that day.<p>Improvements? I wish Reeder pulled from Read it Later. That way, I could have one app that has all my articles.<p>Reading articles online will fill the time you allow it - so just decide how valuable what you are reading really is to you and go from there.",1332136773

3722576,comment,3721989,3721989,15,0,ek,,,"I really like most things about Go, and was even going to use it for a bytecode interpreter project I was working on. A problem that I ran into, however, was that in interpreting a dynamic language with a stack machine, we needed a way to be able to store arbitrary data in stack values, which in C/C++ would be done using a struct with a type flag and then a union of various types.<p>Go doesn't have unions, though, and so this means that we would have ended up using a struct and using about 3x the memory on average, per stack value. You can see this limitation exposed as well in goyacc, the port of Yacc to Go (as the name suggests). Where Bison uses a union for yylval, Go is forced to use a struct.<p>I think this has been discussed on the golang-nuts mailing list a couple times and dismissed, for reasons of which I'm not fully aware.",1332136610

It is more important to have one consistent style than to make everyone happy.

Our app is actually an ecommerce platform. Our churn is pretty high, but customers are not switching to competitors, just dropping out. I know because their domain names tied to their online stores remain abandoned.<p>Should I increase my pricing by at least 200-400% to see if this attracts only the most serious customers, and so that I can better focus my effort on serving them instead of spreading myself too thin? Currently, we are definitely underpriced in the market (an indirect consequence of me being the sole employee and living in a country with much lower expenses), and there are also signs that potential customers have problems taking us seriously because of that.<p>Once we hike our price (to $200/mo), we will be comparable to other competitors.

3722564,comment,3721989,3722105,3,0,enneff,,,"I think what your parent is referring to is that, compared to JavaScript, Go provides a fairly rigid structure in which to write programs. You write packages that consist of type, function, and variable declarations, and link them together with import statements. Its rich standard library supports a range of useful, omnipresent interfaces, which make it easy to do things in an obviously correct, interoperable way.<p>By comparison, JavaScript lets you structure your code in however you like, and there is a very tiny standard library and no real uniformity across implementations, frameworks, and so on. This can be a strength, but I think on balance it is a real weakness in JS. node.js has done a lot to improve this, though the language itself still lets you define anything, anywhere, at any time, and change that state from anywhere else.",1332136313

The field of general-purpose production languages is actually pretty narrow. I somewhat agree with your point that the reasons were on the superficial side.

But he failed at the other half of political communication: repetition. He was always racing ahead of the electorate, speaking on his latest ideas. He was bored with the thought of repeating himself. He never developed the habit of the stump speech, and left his constituents behind.<p>In the influence game, one is eventually faced with a tradeoff between being a thinker who raises the upper bound, and being a communicator/popularizer who raises the median. Thinkers are needed, but if their ideas race too far ahead they languish until a popularizer takes them up.<p>There is a middle way: continue your writing as before, but use the stump as a trailing indicator of your thought process. There is no dishonor in giving audiences an expanded version of your thoughts as of a few essays ago. Don't worry that the ideas aren't ""new"". Definition, then repetition.<p>Also, learning how to be an engaging speaker at the same time as trying out new ideas is hard. Keeping the ideas constant can help you become a better speaker more quickly than you might think.

I don't mean that as a figure of speech; the fellow murdered his business partner with an axe. Now coulson did not know this was going to happen when he hired him, but Cameron (or at least his chief of staff) apparently knew about it before hiring Coulson and decided that he would make a fine addition to the team anyway, desite his extremely dodgy social circle. Add in the fact that Cameron has had a meeting with Murdoch or one of his top lieutenants on average every 2 weeks since becoming PM, at either 10 Downing Street or at Chequers (the PM's official country house, like Camp David for the President), and he looks uncomfortably close to a bunch of rather villainous people.<p>Remember that Cameron is governing as part of a coalition with the Liberal Democratic party, who are allied with him by necessity rather than by choice.

Now, this differs in degrees - if you're a core contributor to a well known library for example, I'd give that a lot more credence than ""hacked on various open source things"".<p>Research on campus also pales in effectiveness to industry experience. Software in industry has a <i>lot</i> of constraints and differences to hacking on your own time, at your own pace, and similarly has a <i>lot</i> of differences to academia.<p>This is supported by my interview experiences - I interview a <i>lot</i> of masters-level people with impressive rosters of research projects on their resumes, but many of them <i>cannot</i> code at all, to the point where I wonder what exactly they contributed to these projects, if anything.

Most modern, capitalist economies try to maintain at least some level of surplus in the labour market, because history has shown that it is a good idea.<p>The scheme I worked for was an attempt to rehabilitate the long term unemployed and attempt to train them in a marketable skill.

Something around 90% of cases resulted in punishment while I was there.<p>Basically, a group of students is selected to oversee the trial.  They are repeatedly instructed that they must issue a guilty verdict if a preponderance of the evidence (51%) points that way.  An overseeing officer (captain or admiral) supervises the proceedings and assigns a punishment after a guilty verdict.  This combination creates a strong expectation that students will issue a guilty verdict.  (If this does not make sense, then you have not been around ""real"" authority and I cannot succinctly explain.)  For juniors or seniors, punishment is typically expulsion and a $100,000 fine to cover training expenses.  For underclass, it is typically a six-month probationary period (this is closer to a jail sentence than a normal college probation).<p>In some respects, the Navy is an exceptional circumstance.  Most people would rather have lots of innocent people be punished than have a potential cheat graduate and be placed in control of nuclear weapons.  Still, I have seen lots of innocent people punished (or guilty people punished way too severely) to not be skeptical of a system that has any chance of going this direction.<p>As for personal experience, I was never accused of an honor violation, but I testified at honor hearings for friends.

2779879,comment,2776993,2779664,1,0,kalid,,,"Thanks for the reply. Yep, I'm assuming that the benefits will get shared (which is not guaranteed) but I think capitalism and exising human charity will work. Here's my amateur economic analysis:<p>If you can supply widgets more cheaply, you can underprice the competition and capture the market (I'm talking more about basic commodities for survival, food, clean water, shelter, etc.). And of course the other companies will compete, have better robots, etc. and you'll have a race to the bottom (this even happens with 'luxury' goods like USB drives). If I can provide aluminum for cheaper, I can flood the market with it (which drives prices down, but I get the profit).<p>Secondly, we have plenty of charities -- if advanced labor saving devices existed, governments and others would funnel exising funds to acquire them and put them to use. Why pay for food stamps when you can give everyone their daily bread?<p>I think capitalism based on survival would eventually have to phase itself out -- it would move to virtual currency where people traded currency for optional goods/services they couldn't acquire with the machines (handcrafted xyz, live concert tickets, etc.).<p>I may really be on this plant thing, but I imagine a world where, at minimum, we get food/water ""for free"" from the tireless robotic background workers (like air) and everything else is based on human interest. I think humans have enough demonstrated charity to donate something like that once developed.<p>But, I think the bigger threat is this: a world where robots are advanced enough to provide everything is probably one where a sufficiently powerful country could take over everything.",1311059300

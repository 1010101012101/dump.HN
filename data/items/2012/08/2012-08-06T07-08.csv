4344349,comment,4342991,4342991,13,0,alister,,,"Since we're talking about the Shannon limit, why does a 56 Kbps modem not violate it?<p>The common wisdom in the early '90s was that the fastest possible modem for a dial-up connection would be ~35 Kbps. I even remember reading this ""fact"" in a communications theory book from that era. Analog modems could <i>never</i> be faster. (It's assumed that US and Canadian analog telephones have a 3 kHz channel.)<p>Then why does a 56 Kbps modem not violate the Shannon limit for data transmission on a 3 kHz channel? How is it possible to break a fundamental principle of information theory?<p>This question has bugged me a lot. Based on some research on web, I tried to put together an intuitive answer to what happened. Here's my answer, but I welcome insight or corrections from people knowledgeable in telephony or information theory.<p>At the time the book was written--when people believed that dial-up modems could never be faster than 35 Kbps--the telephone network was <i>perceived</i> as being analog end to end (though lots of it was already becoming digital), like this:<p><pre><code>    User<------------{ telco network }------------------------>ISP
           (analog)        (analog)      (analog)
</code></pre>
A critical assumption in calculating the Shannon limit was the noise floor of the network, which was taken to be 35 dB, a figure based on an all-analog network. (A higher dB number is better for transmission quality.) The Shannon limit would be 35 Kbps based on a 3 kHz bandwidth and that particular signal to noise ratio of 35 dB. (  bps = BW log2 (1 + P/N) = 3000 log2 (1 + 10^(35/10)) = 34881 bps )<p>However, by the mid-'90s, most of the telco network became digital. Only the customer loop--the connection between the user and the telephone company--remained analog. So now, with respect to the Shannon limit, only the noise floor of the customer loop matters, since the rest is digital:<p><pre><code>    User<------------{ telco network }------------------------>ISP
           (analog)        (digital)     (also digital)
</code></pre>
It turns out that it is possible to achieve a much better S/N ratio when only the customer loop is analog. The Shannon limit would be based on a 3 kHz bandwidth (the same bandwidth as before) and but a much higher noise floor of 98 dB for the customer loop. The Shannon limit would now be ~97 Kbps. ( bps = BW log2 (1 + P/N) = 3000 log2 (1 + 10^(98/10)) = 97664 bps )<p>The Shannon limit <i>still</i> exists, but other factors related to the network would limit the data rate before this bigger Shannon limit takes effect.<p>So the key thing that the experts and the communications theory book got wrong was to neglect the hidden assumption about S/N ratio. The bandwidth matters, but the S/N ratio matters too.",1344239819

The 2013 even is made at a different factory, now in Louisville, instead of near Kansas City, Mo. The boxy old Escape was a big seller for Ford, so starting over was a risk. The new version hit showrooms in June and sales that month jumped 28% from a year ago, according to Autodata. But sales tumbled nearly 12% in July. The July slip was at least partly because of recalls. One recall is because the carpet might interfere with the brake pedal. The other one is for potential fire risk in models with the 1.6-liter EcoBoost engine, the one that most people are expected to choose.

For example, the ESA is building Galileo, a positioning system similar to GPS, primarily for strategic military needs.  The Russians and the Chinese, who make up almost the entire remainder of global space spending after the EU, spend quite a bit on military space, but there is not reliable data.  In fact, there is basically no data on Chinese spending at all, it's an industry estimate of their spending based on outside observations.  In addition, there is some crossover each way.  Hubble, in particular, received substantial benefit from military research into spy satellites, not to mention the recent gift of two space telescopes to NASA from NRO.  At best it's unclear how to decouple the spending in the US, and nearly impossible internationally.  I believe going with the totals is fair, as the approximate civilian to military ratio would be pretty close internationally, given the obvious military implications of space, like ICBM's and spying, the interchangeable nature of the fundamental research in each field (e.g. ICBM guidance systems research can be applied to landing on Mars, spy satellites are space telescopes if you turn them around), and the countries involved.",1344238799

My response is that Firefox being free is completely irrelevant to my point.  I'm the owner of the computer.  You should never install anything on my computer without my consent.  And yes, I think it is bad for you to do that with an average user also.  I, as a user, downloaded Firefox 3.x (or whatever version) and installed it.  I expect Firefox 3.x to be the one that is running after I install it.  I <i>don't</i> have a problem with the installation program putting up a dialog that says ""We'd like to keep this software up to date.  May we turn on automatic updates for this software? (yes/no)"".  As I said in my previous post, I can even begrudgingly live with the ""Yes"" option being checked by default.  To me, it is the fact that all of this is done by default <i>without ever asking me about it</i> that is bad bad bad.  The user should be told.  A simple explanation is not difficult, and most users who would go to the trouble of installing something should be able to understand a reasonably well-written explanation.  And even if only 40% of them do, it is still better that the option be given.  If they don't want to be bothered with it, they are most likely going to just take the defaults anyway.<p>As to the nitpick about the analogy -- of <i>course</i> it isn't the same level of severity.  It's an analogy.  Installing a fire alarm system can't be compared to installing Firefox on my computer either.  One takes hours, the other takes only minutes.  I wasn't trying to say that breaking and entering was equivalent to covertly installing program updates without user consent.  I was merely trying to complete the analogy (perhaps remote wireless fire alarm firmware updates without homeowner consent would have been a better choice -- but I didn't think of that possibility until just now.  :-D )<p>The semi-amusing part about this whole discussion is the reason that I'm replying again.  I'd installed Firefox on one of the machines in my house a while back, and I forgot to turn off the automatic updates.  Started up Firefox only to have it apply the update it had automatically downloaded without my knowledge.  Grrrrrrr.  Sorry, this just rubs me the wrong way, and I don't like Firefox running a background service to install updates either (also an option that I didn't chose).",1344237306

I'm no expect, so I looked up ""starvation diet"". It brought me to the main wiki pain on dieting. This is what it says about ""Very low-calorie diets"":<p>""They subject the body to starvation and produce an average weekly weight loss of 3.35.5 lb.""<p>If 5.5lb a week is the result of starvation, what might 7lbs/week be? It continues by cautioning about the dangers of such diets.<p>Just because you eat, doesn't mean you can't starve. Consider protein poisoning (aka, rabbit starvation).",1344236689

No keyboard by default says it all. You wont write a full novel on a iPad. You wont code something very long on it. And you wont even have the tools at hand to develop the apps that you use everyday. It is completely asymetric, and the barrier for curious kids to do something is huge. Whereas the same kids can just open a terminal on a Linux device and start experimenting away.",1344236647

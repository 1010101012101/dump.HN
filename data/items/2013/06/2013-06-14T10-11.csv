Likewise Oracle didn&#x27;t really buy Java; they bought Sun and Java just happened to be a nice extra.<p>I&#x27;ve heard people say this was like what Cisco tried to do with Linksys by trying to get into consumer and SMB. Plus we know from Cisco what happens when you buy a brand and let it stagnate.<p>Buying MySQL for Oracle, I think, wasn&#x27;t really a matter of creating a new foothold in the hobby/SMB market or the like. Bringing it under their name was about adding value to their own brand. &quot;Look, we cater to the &#x27;small&#x27; guys too!&quot; (And that&#x27;s however arbitrarily people define &#x27;small&#x27; since Adwords clearly doesn&#x27;t fit the label.)

<i>Solubility of oxygen in equilibration with air in fresh and sea (salt) water - pressures ranging 1 - 4 bar abs</i><p><a href=""http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=kt167nb66r&chunk.id=d3_6_ch06&toc.id=ch06&brand=eschol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=kt167nb...</a>
<i>In studies of the distribution of dissolved gases in the sea it is generally assumed that, whatever the location of a water particle, at some time it has been at the surface and in equilibrium with the air. In their studies of the dissolved nitrogen content Rakestraw and Emmel (1938a) have found that the water is virtually saturated (referred to a normal atmosphere), regardless of depth; therefore this assumption appears valid and also indicates that biological activity involving either fixation or production of nitrogen cannot be sufficient to affect significantly the concentration of this gas in the water. As the waters of the oceans appear to have been saturated with oxygen and carbon dioxide at some stage in their history when they were at the surface, the differences between the saturation values (computed from the temperatures and salinities) and the observed contents are measures of the changes which have been effected by biological agencies. The factors influencing the distribution of carbon dioxide are discussed in the following sections, and the distribution of dissolved oxygen will be considered in many places in the ensuing chapters.</i>",1371207176

Rumours of secret night flights carrying kidnapped people and delivering them to off limits secret torture prisons in places out of jurisdiction.

Outline your concerns clearly and directly, request that they take some form of action, and ask them to reply to you giving their views and what action they took. Remember that the MP will expect requests to be something actionable: ask them to consider writing to the Home Secretary and/or Prime Minister, speak if the matter comes up for debate, sign an early day motion, etc.<p>It&#x27;s important to ask them to reply to you - and be prepared to follow-up if they don&#x27;t.

I can see how my references to process patents might have confused you, but if you ignore those asides, that should take care of your complaints.<p>Your wooden machine is different from cDNA.  cDNA is an obvious 1:1 mapping of something that already exists: mRNA.  It&#x27;s obvious because that&#x27;s exactly what retroviruses do.  (Ignoring here the negative vs positive sense distinction in viral RNA because it&#x27;s irrelevant once the RNA is converted to double-stranded DNA.)<p>If the gene <i>information</i> previously exists in nature, ALL equivalent forms (DNA, mRNA, cDNA, even tRNA) should be excluded from patentability, because they are <i>beyond obvious</i> once you know the nucleotide sequence, and they are <i>equivalent</i> (in terms of information theory).  The equivalence (ignoring introns) of all forms of DNA and RNA is universally known (barring strange cases where DNA/RNA structure might interfere with transcription).<p>Novel synthesis methods might be patentable.  Novel enzymes that can translate between the forms, also might be patentable.  But that&#x27;s not this case.  Often when something obvious or preexisting is patented, a retort is that while the thing may not be patentable, the process to create it might be.  I was trying to head off that argument that Myriad might have something patentable here even if the cDNA itself is not patentable.",1371204808

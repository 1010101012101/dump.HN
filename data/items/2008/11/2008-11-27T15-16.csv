378720,comment,377991,377991,0,0,sokoloff,,,"There's a quite legitimate reason to use exploding offers (beyond the implied ""bad"" reasons Joel cites): to ensure that companies get exactly the number of college hires that they want.<p>If you've got budget for ""no more than 20"" and a real desire to hit 20 on the dot, then it's entirely rational (and I think reasonable) to extend exploding offers to your top 30 candidates, and then as the prior offers expire or are turned down, to extend offers to the ""waitlist"". It's not particularly different from the college admissions process, or a season ticket renewal process, daycare/pre-school admissions waitlisting, or any other means of efficiently allocating limited resources over a period of time, and is certainly not inherently evil.",1227800925

The best part is that a few weeks later she was like, ""I really appreciate you giving me the iPod but this thing sucks."" She doesn't use it anymore so I don't have a clue what happened with it. It's probably still getting passed around like it's radioactive. It's pretty bad when people won't use your product for free. :)",1227799558

Godel's incompleteness theorem (GIT) doesn't necessarily impact physics because physics can just use the untouched part of maths.  However, Chaitin says his Omega number impacts all of maths with the same kind of consequence as GIT.  Therefore, physics and the TEO is in trouble no matter what part of maths it uses.",1227798384

I re-gifted the one I got for Christmas last year.<p>My theory on the iPod touch is that it's a scheme to further cement in people's minds the association between the iPod and the iPhone. I don't think they ever expected it to be a cash cow. If they did they probably would have killed off the classic iPod. After all, Apple consistently makes products that consumers aren't necessarily clamoring for and then tells us it's exactly what we want. The iPod Touch is kind of an oddball in the iPod line and they treat it like one.<p>You've got the classic iPod with scroll wheel and hard drive. You've got the smaller one with scroll wheel and flash memory to compete in that market. Then there's this touch screen thing that's basically an iPhone without the phone and it's called an iPod. The capacity is low. The battery life is abysmal. It's just as big and expensive as the iPod classic. I don't have a clue what's compelling about that. But people see the iPhone and think ""it's just like the new iPod only it's a phone too.""",1227798188

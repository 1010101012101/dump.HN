If central banks don&#x27;t absorb that outflow of debt then either the USG reduces its spend (as if, those NSA datacentres aren&#x27;t cheap), interest rates go up (USG will need will need even more debt to pay its debt) or the fed continues to buy it all up.",1379811579

People die in competetive sports all the time. Its very rare but still, there are people dieing doing marathons, thriathlons, crossfit, biking and even less taxing endurance sports like football(soccer). Its rarer than rhabdo but excessive stress on your cardiovascular system can kill you (cardiac arrest, heart attack etc) especially if your heart isnt 100% healthy (and most young people have never made a check on their heart).<p>No reason to panic though, its very very rare, but it happens and thus it should be noted that excessive excersise (in whatever shape or form) just isnt risk free.",1379811578

Being able to work in a non-academic environment is incredibly important, because honestly the pace and quality of technical work done in academic settings just isn&#x27;t comparable.<p>> &quot;Companies hesitated to hire a Ph.D. with no industry experience&quot;<p>That, for me, would be the #1 red flag. How does one even go through getting a PhD without getting <i>any</i> industrial experience? Not a single internship, even as an undergraduate?<p>This tells me that either the PhD literally can&#x27;t code (and hence nobody even wanted them as an intern) or despises industry so much that they never wanted an internship (and hence I&#x27;d be pretty worried about how much they&#x27;d be committed to the new job).",1379811488

As for quality, of course quality varies - no HQ can ever ensure every coach is good and of course following one specific methodology by itself does not make the coach good. In fact, I was always told (not in CF but in other training context) many times that choosing good teacher is more important than choosing style/methodology - styles have their merits and demerits, but you can only appreciate them if your teacher is good.<p>So if the point is that you need to approach CF carefully with an eye for a good teacher - this is absolutely true.<p>>>> Personally, I think if you&#x27;re lifting some multiple of your BW in any capacity<p>Hopefully, one day :) So far I don&#x27;t think I have reached 2x of my BW in any exercise.

Every executive/financial trader/beltway insider had one.  The early 800/900 series Blackberry were like the iPhone of 2007.<p>In 2007 the iPhone was seen as an oddity by those who used their blackberries for business - without a keyboard, and really rudimentary communication tools, it wasn&#x27;t ready for real-time business communication.  But wow - that browser, and maps app was something else; and then Apple let third parties develop applications for the iPhone...<p>By 2009, after a couple iterations of the iPhone, I was running a network engineering team, and provided everyone on the team a blackberry so they could communicate real time with each other (We had a corporate BES server).  Every single one of them was left in a desk drawer, as people ignored them and just connected their iPhone to their iMap account and used SMS for the real time stuff.<p>I just got back from a 4 week engagement in Singapore, and I was working daily with fifteen people in five organizations across four companies, distributed across three sites and field visits.  We had to perform real-time communication during some particularly tricky diagnostic event on hardware, at the same time we were tracking some configuration remediation in a meter-lab.    Every single person present (except for one poor Field Engineering manager from California who showed up with a non-GSM android) kept in touch with WhatsApp.  We didn&#x27;t even have to supply the four college students we hired to do some field-evaluations with phones  - they showed up with their own devices (all Androids), and we simply added their accounts to our group chat system.  Latency was on the order of a second even with Singapore&#x27;s surprisingly iffy data environment (at least from the perspective of my California AT&T iPhone)<p>I think a major contributor to the death of blackberry was a combination of iMap ports open to the internet + Exchange Support in iPhone + awesome replacements for BBMS (inexpensive SMS, Viber, Whatsapp, etc...) - every key advantage of the Black Berry, with the exception of that keyboard, has an equivalent or better replacement today on the Android/IOS platform, with the addition of a world class app suite that&#x27;s available on the Android/iPhone, but will never, ever, come to the Blackberry (except in the form of Android sideloading - but that further kills the need to develop blackberry specific apps)<p>That&#x27;s what killed the Blackberry.",1379811328

Kids not fitting into their peer group and being ostracized or picked on due to a lack of a phone/smartphone probably doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal to the 20, 30, or 40-something parent. Probably because that 20,30, or 40-something parent has forgotten what it was like to be a 7th grader.  It also breeds feelings of resentment, and it portrays to the child a beautiful example of hypocrisy, as the parental unit continues to use the so-called &quot;socially destructive&quot; devices.<p>If you are not planning on giving your child a cellphone because you&#x27;re afraid of it&#x27;s destructive effect on their ability to communicate with other human beings, then what more are you doing to encourage social growth in your child? Not giving your kid a cellphone is a passive action, not a proactive action.",1379811186

6425279,comment,6424939,6425066,4,0,dobbsbob,,,"Agreed. This is more reactionary nonsense I remember hearing in the 1990s when nintendo would ruin everything. Before that cable and MTV was going to ruin society. Before that dancing and horror movies would destroy future generations.<p>I distinctly recall my parents kicking me off the landline phone in the early 90s every single night from talking to my friends, because they could hear me in my room so instead of staring at a flickering box with mundane sitcoms my other alternative was to jump on IRC or dial STS chatboards to talk to hackers in NYC that gave me (what was at the time) priceless information. How did that hurt my communications skills or development. By the time mobile phones became affordable I was already chatting with all of my IRL friends using online messenger instead of calling them since as kids, you are always kicked off the phone or parents/siblings pick up landlines and would listen in.<p>One thing I definitely know kids do is lookup safe sex and other awkward questions on sexuality and gender on their phones. Why you would deny your kid access to medical information and peer counselling so they can make correct choices or seek depression outlets I have no idea. They aren&#x27;t going to ask you anything, and schools have sex ed too late. I used to listen to a call in radio show late at night when I was 13 that was all about sex ed. These shows don&#x27;t exist anymore, there&#x27;s nothing on cable, and parents are even more reactionary conservative now just look at the Tea Party nutbar parents attempting to extinguish sex ed from schools at every opportunity. Kids are unlikely to do it on a home computer too because there might be history their parents can find.<p>How do I know kids are doing this? Because the local schools here told everybody that the majority of searches done on school open wifi was sex ed and gay support groups (not porn, medical sites). They cited this as a reason to start sex ed in Grade 6 instead of the usual Grade 9. They are also looking up drug safety specifically MDMA correct doses and how to identify fake drugs, or how to order testing kits.<p>Just make sure you tell your kid not to use social media under a real identity ever, and to be careful where they send pictures to avoid future facial recognition software databases, blackmail and stalkers.<p>Nothing your kids do now is any different than what you did as a kid just you can&#x27;t remember how shitty it was staring at the wall all night because you were forbidden to go out on a school night, TV was complete shit, the radio played nothing but bland shit and you had nothing interesting to read since your parents denied you any literature they didn&#x27;t want you to see. My parents discovered a philosophy book that doubted the existence of God and they shredded it in front of me, so I went online and read it. I had to sneak out of my house in the middle of the night just so I could see my Grade 8 girlfriend to talk for a few hours in a dangerous pitch black park. Now you can just text each other or jump on chat instead of wandering the streets at one in the morning.<p>EDIT: I bet his kids already have smart phones and just hide them. Every school has a small trading economy just trade an older Android in exchange for homework being done or sell something. A kid in my school sold candy in grade 5 all the other kids bought daily. He was super rich by kid standards. I traded a bunch of hacker tfilez and private invites to warez boards in exchange for a pager in 1991. Another kid would rent his father&#x27;s porn mags and videos out, and in Grade 8 a kid in my school would sell cheat codes and finishing moves to video games in the arcades. You could also pay the kid who worked in the office to give you a late slip instead of getting the standard detention and lecture.",1379810879

One, more than 2 reps tends Cause bicipital tendonitis and shoulder discomfort. This pain is commonly felt while benching but, in fact, comes from squatting. The bar shifts to some degree, causing damage. Having your hands spaced too close on the bar may also be the culprit.

One of the things I hated about IT support, and I found it common with most colleagues, was the idea that if you are in IT, every thing with a plug or batteries is some how part of an IT person&#x27;s skill set. Because we are the clever mysterious people who can fix the server, we must also be able to explain the MD&#x27;s new HiFi to him, fix the microwave or mobile phone, or some such.<p>So, out comes Blackberry and it suddenly becomes the executive&#x27;s toy of choice, and we were expected to support them. No one asked, there was no meeting or consideration, they just bought Blackberrys themselves, bought them in and expected us to be configuring and supporting them.

6425194,comment,6424280,6424489,2,0,abuehrle,,,"Well put. Evaluating &quot;CrossFit&quot; is difficult by design---HQ wants boxes to be almost completely autonomous. The best statement of CrossFit&#x27;s philosophy is Greg Glassman&#x27;s &quot;World-Class Fitness in 100 Words&quot;[1]. There&#x27;s nothing there about doing lots of poor quality reps as quickly as possible.<p>I began my CrossFit career at San Francisco CrossFit and thought it was the best thing ever. Part of each session focused on mobility. Bad reps were not tolerated. It was like a daily seminar on how to maintain, tune, and fix the human machine. The skills I learned will benefit me greatly as I age.<p>Then I had to move, and I saw the dark side of CrossFit. Inept trainers with poor attitudes, encouraging speed and weight with no concern for proper body mechanics. I work out on my own now, practicing skills I learned at SFCF.<p>Bottom line: it&#x27;s the box that matters.<p>[1] &quot;Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C&J, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc, hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports. &quot; -- <a href=""http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/start-how.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/start-how.html</a>",1379809051

By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become &#x27;profiteers,&#x27; who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.<p>Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.\n^^^<p>(I add:  the one man in a million including, apparently, people with PHDs)",1379808850

And I'm curious how quickly people here feel obligated to respond to them.<p>It's quite expensive to reduce the risks of disaster, and funds are tight. Mirrored servers + high level SLA costs thousands of dollars. We can't spend that to soften the blow of a disaster, which has only a 5% chance/yr per server or so of occurring.",1224673010

339905,comment,339897,339900,0,0,jd,,,"No different levels of support: best-effort is the best we can do. This means that sometimes it may take a while for us to get respond to somebody, given that we have to sleep occasionally.<p>I'm mostly curious how other people deal with it. Do people carry a laptop everywhere so they can plug in whenever something happens? Or do people just hope for the best and deal with problems only during ""office hours""?",1224672485

I guess the real challenge will be when Android results come out (presumably not until the next quarter?).",1224672351

If it's more dominant than SVN in 2011, that's when I'll switch.",1224671064
339897,story,,,19,23,jd,"Ask HN: how quickly do you answer support emails?",,"How do you deal with support emails? Ideally, you deal with each request within the hour. Especially when you have to back and forth a few times quick turnaround time is critical. But when you're in different timezones (and we're a European startup) it becomes far more challenging. Add to that we can only work on our startup part-time and it becomes an even bigger challenge.<p>How quickly do you respond to support requests? And when disaster strikes (server down/hacked/etc) is there always somebody ready to deal with it?",1224670750
339896,comment,339661,339876,0,0,albertcardona,,,"The nice part is that with git, one can interact with svn projects seamlessly via git-svn -- so endless local commits may be repacked to one single remote commit or push.<p>But svn lacks suh flexibility to interact with others. Hence git > svn, as in <i>svn is a tiny subset of git</i>.",1224670624

I think Umair means to provoke thought more than anything else.<p>If he is at least a bit right, then businesses will naturally converge to these ideas, without requiring deep rational inquiry (the rationalism will be limited to: ""those guys are doing something new and it's working, so let us also do it"").",1224670598
339893,comment,339661,339661,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I'll add a fourth, which is the ""killer feature"" for me and my current workflow:<p>Git allows working from more than one system at once without requiring a constant server connection. When I'm on the go and want to make changes to my code from my laptop, I can make commits, I've got access to the full history, etc. All that's required is a pull from my desktop before I leave my office, and I've got a shell script that pulls the repositories for all my projects at once.<p>With something like SVN, this kind of thing was a major pain, as I'd either have to work just with my local copy on the laptop (leading to poorly tracked mega-commits), or copy the whole file system structure of the repository to the laptop, which quickly gets you into desynchronised territory. Add another developer and you're instantly dead with that kind of system.",1224670585

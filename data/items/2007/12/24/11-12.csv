I started out with a cron job monitoring top every minute, and many times the usage hits 50% - I'm using Django, so the GIL means that's at full capacity, but I have no idea how instantaneous that figure is.<p>I got some helpful advice on the Django chat room to monitor Apache, but really what I'd like is for some warning to be dumped to a log if a connection queue backs up for more than a second (i.e. the server is at full capacity). That'll be time to cache/upgrade. :)",1198497543

There are startups that work with embedded micro controllers, and there are startups that create networking software, startups that work on the Windows Desktop and startups that work as server ware that is accessed via http.  <p>Each one of those domains is going to have different requirements, and each one of those would be better served by one language as opposed to another.  <p>It would be like asking people, ""which human language is best for communicating"".  Well, if I had to describe many different kinds and varieties of snow, I'd probably choose an Eskimo dialect.  If I had to describe many different levels of respect, honor and shame, I'd say Japanese.  If I was to communicate in the business realm, I'd have to say English.  And, if I had to talk about hunting tapirs in a rain forest, I'd probably use a dialect native to tribes in the Amazon.  <p>With all due respect to PG, the idea of One True Language (tm) is a myth as far as I'm concerned.  Langauges are tools.  Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses.  Familiarize yourself with enough different tools so you can make intelligent decisions, and then use the most powerful language/tool for the job at hand.",1198495599

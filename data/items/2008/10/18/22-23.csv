The series is still ongoing - so if you find some more inputs, then let me know. I'll try to write about it.",1224370792
336725,comment,336556,336678,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"Yeah, I personally think that the moral argument against government intervention is bunk. That said, I do think there's a strong consequentialist argument to be made for markets and against regulation. To me, this seems like the basic position of eg. Reason Magazine, Wil Wilkinson, etc.",1224370748

336723,comment,336556,336654,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Just to clarify, there is a simple general principle at work: the government should provide only <i>public goods</i> (1). The main dispute among libertarians is which goods qualify as public goods (e.g., is fire protection public or private?).<p>(1) A public good is one that is non-rivalrous and non-exclusive. Protection from commies is a public good (a dead commie isn't robbing you or me). Cheese fries are not (every fry I eat is one you can't).",1224370248

336714,comment,336556,336690,0,0,walterk,,,"I would agree that the crash doesn't refute libertarianism to the extent that libertarianism demands a completely free market.  On the other hand, the chances of libertarians getting their way in a large-scale society like the US is exactly nil, and there's an excellent case to be made that injecting libertarian-motivated policies in a non-libertarian environment, for no reason beyond their agreement with libertarian ideology, can be more disastrous than the alternatives.<p>I have a friend who was beginning to think anarchism was the way to go, but I nipped that thought in the bud by pointing out that the arguments for anarchism are highly intellectual and incapable of swaying the masses.  The same is true of libertarianism.<p>Democratic and socialist revolutions had their origins in highly intellectual arguments, but the confrontations their ideologies demanded were easily translated into something that the non-intellectual populace could forcibly get behind (to whatever extend this was actually necessary).  It's hard to see how you'd sway a majority of the American populace into backing the sort of completely free market libertarians want to see.  And if that's not doable, libertarian proponents would better spend their time figuring out how to make a decidedly interventionist society work more efficiently.",1224369425

That's who you're blaming?<p>Well, let's assemble all of congress, and ask them, ""Will all libertarians raise their hands?"" You'll have one hand raised.<p>Assemble every high level official in the Bush administration--ask them the same thing. [crickets chirp]<p>Do the same thing throughout all the bureaucracies...well, here you might get a few, since low-level people see how things are, and don't worry too much about political presentation. But still...2 or 3 percent at most.<p>And Greenspan? The very definition of a market-manipulator is a...libertarian? Ah, and Hitler provided free housing for the Jews! That's right!<p>This is like blaming the Atheists for 9/11 because there was a single atheist among the victims. I'm glad to see a copy of that rubbish was in Newsweek. That's great.",1224368721

We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.""",1224368698

I don't <i>think</i> so, but I might be wrong.<p>I think you should look at a more technical factor. Right now, it is looking better for startups than ever. You have programmable mobile phones, clouds at Amazon and Google, fast Javascript in browsers, computers so fast that interpreted languages can compete and so on. Combine this with the webs ability to reach a massive userbase in a short amount of time. In short: The toolset for startups has never looked better than this. The idea-space on which startup ideas thrives is just getting wider and wider.<p>Also note that most companies do not get it. The work they want people to do is horribly boring. People have, via the buzz, realized that taking the chance with a startup might be more interesting. Even if they don't succeed they have tried. And here is the killer: they might have failed, but they have learned more compared to a ""common"" job.",1224368104

The shitting part comes first, then afterwards, there's nothing really left, and anything you drink just comes flowing right out. They get parched and die of dehydration.<p>It's easier than dying of malaria. With malaria, you feel as cold as hell, but you're burning up. Then you go into a heat delirium, where you start having hallucinations, you start throwing up at the same time everyday, you can't move anymore, and you slip into death. A lot more people die of malaria than of diarhea. And malaria is a lot easier to cure.",1224367792

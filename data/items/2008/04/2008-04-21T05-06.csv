Anything below 50% you lose the majority vote (try to keep 60% or more, if possible) and your idea due to you being a minority may get changed.  In turn and in the long run your startup becomes a job rather then a passion!",1208756527

169116,comment,168636,168636,0,0,towny777,,,"There must be something in the air right now. I published an article about this very issue on March 27th (you can view it at <a href=""http://uberdigi.blogspot.com/2008/03/secret-of-life-in-participation-age.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uberdigi.blogspot.com/2008/03/secret-of-life-in-parti...</a>). My main point is that being useful is the most important value in the participation age. If an individual or business makes usefulness their number one priority they increase their chance for success. In this case I think goodness and usefulness are synonymous.<p>I got this idea from Buckminster Fuller. He failed miserably until he had an epiphany that he would not concentrate on success, but rather on making himself a servant to the universe. Ultimately this meant that he would just start working on good and useful things. As a result, he became a controversial figure but also pretty successful.",1208755791
169115,comment,168750,169108,0,0,breily,,,"The problem with that is that while there are millions of computers that can connect to the internet, hardly any cars/fridges/whatever can do that right now.  The technology is there, but not widespread.  So as a young startup trying to get attention, the millions of potential users from traditional computers pulls much more strongly than a few thousand internet ready fridges.",1208755719

I might look for stats later, but surely a certified professional in the field has some credibility.<p>""Porn makes money therefore it is abused""<p>That isn't what I'm saying.  Porn makes so much more money than any other online industry that it seems very likely the money comes from abuse.  Similar to why the drug trade is so lucrative.<p>Also, I did not say lust is a new phenomena.  In fact, you agree with my point.  Since it is such a common aspect of being a male throughout history, then it seems easy to infer men are likely to indulge in an easy outlet for eroticism.",1208755626
169113,comment,168603,168603,0,0,hollerith,,,"The Million Dollar Web Page (there is a wikipedia entry on it) made its owner about a million dollars (and started a fad called pixel advertising or some such) and although it entailed execution, the effort required to execute seems to have been very low relative to the payoff: the guy probably made thousands of dollars an hour on his time investment.<p>I am aware that this example does not meet the 3 criteria in the original question.  I am answering a related question, namely, Can a good idea act as a large ""effort multiplier""?  The Million Dollar Web Page suggests that the answer is yes.",1208755379

Not only in terms of decency, but it also means less efficiency and aesthetics.<p>Say efficiency and aesthetics are two sides of the same coin.

169108,comment,168750,169026,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"One idea in general, is jumping out of the browser, and not in the Silverlight/Apollo way. It's important that we begin thinking of the Internet in more abstract ways instead of the current primarily visual experience. We've reached a point where a lot of objects we deal with on a daily basis are augmented by computers (e.g., our cars). We're on the cusp of these devices and many more being augmented by the Internet. What does it mean for my fridge, book shelf, or weight-lifting equipment to have Internet access? Questions like this have been left in the domain of so-called futurists or academics. But I think it's time for industry to start taking these seriously. The technology is here.",1208755155

For example, I tend to eat a lot of Bi-Bim-Don at Matsuya, with a side of salad.  Costs less than 500 yen (about $5 US), really healthy, and tastes great.<p>You also left out Okonomiyaki, which is not only delicious, but surprisingly healthy.  And onigiri...<p>Damnit, now I miss Japanese food again. :)",1208754282
169099,comment,169060,169060,0,0,samratjp,,,"Well, again, look for everyday pains. If there is something on some of your customers' minds when they wake up, find that something and solve that for them, so they have one less thing to worry about. Really that's what even Google says AND does, focus on the customer and everything else will follow.<p>Having said all that, use your skill as a tool! Let's take Octopart as an example - the founders' pain was they couldn't find their parts easily online. So, they put their skills (algorithms [well, technically, they were physicists, but any good physicist is a good mathematician]) to work - they built a great search that Google doesn't cater to.<p>Lessons:
1) They identified pain - no search for parts
2) They used their skillset - math (algorithms)  
3) They are making the world a better place* (as in much more of an impact* than those playthings you mentioned).
*-very very relative<p>As about bio-informatics, who knows? Heck, no one really knows about any industry's future. If someone claims to know, he/she is trying to sell something - may it be an idea, prophecy, or plain bull-shiitake mushrooms :) Point is that if you have really identified your customers' pain, then they will happily send their wheel barrows full of love AND money towards your solution.",1208754137

Ad money is infinite as long as people are buying  products and services online and offline. Reddit & Digg are algorithms none the less. Writing powerful algorithms need MARKETS willing to pay for your time and provide returns to your investors. Anyway, if you want to change people's life; its very easy. Think about Darfur and software that can help. Think about an algorithm that can use GoogleMaps, RFID, GPS, SocialGraph, CommodityPrices, UNICEF api. I am sure such a project will be challenging and help with your depression. Goodluck.",1208754059

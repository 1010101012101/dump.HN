I have a 22 year old daughter and I see how she uses FB, and far more often than not events are organized with text messages, and it's iffy whether there's an announcement of FB. More likely a status update during or after the event. I work at a university and was FB friends with some students I work with, and the same trend seemed to hold with them.<p>Young people are comfortable with many different means of communication, and often use one that fits well for their purpose at the time.",1314457198

Upgrading to Lucid moved your window controls.  Upgrading to Natty turned on Unity.

I'm a developer, and I have found that everything in the Linux world seems to be set up with me in mind.<p>Dependencies are easier to install, there is a larger, more knowledgeable support network (compare the Ubuntu forums to any Mac forum, it's not even close), and I have discovered how powerful the command line is as a development tool.<p>Also, when I run into a hitch during development, Google takes my operating system into account. Googling answers to development questions provides me much more relevant results on Ubuntu than it ever did on the Mac.<p>Plus, being able to develop web apps on the same or a similar operating system to the environment it will be deployed on is incredibly convenient.<p>I will say that most of my leisure time now goes to developing personal projects, rather than to gaming or other multimedia - things I often did on my Mac. But I think that's a good thing. When I do invoicing or I need to work with clients' data on spreadsheets, OpenOffice and LibreOffice, respectively, have served me just fine.<p>If you live in a multi-computer household like I do, I think it makes sense to have one machine that dual boots the latest Windows and Ubuntu to be able to take advantage of games and other multimedia. However, for the PCs that are only being used for day-to-day things like email, web surfing, and office tools, then Ubuntu is the best value there is.",1314456979

It's just so much easier to get git, svn, Ruby, Python or Node.js up and running on OSX than Windows. The only thing Windows does better/easier is WAMP thanks to the proliferation of free all-in-one installers. Windows is probably why PHP remains so popular. (I wonder how many companies develop PHP on Windows and deploy to cheap Linux hosts)<p>As for the tools, Visual Studio feels like a walled garden and I'm too scared to edit the defaults because I might break something. Why did it create so many files and reference all these DLLs? Do I need all of them?! How do I edit this web.config file? Compare this with Rails where I know exactly why it creates the files that it does and have no fear in going in a ripping out the defaults and deleting files.<p>While you're at it, let's talk community. The difference between the OSS and Windows developer community is striking. On one side, you have passionate Rubyists going on and on about how Ruby, Gems, etc are all so great. The same for Python and Node.js. These guys also code in their spare time and are active on GitHub. On the other side, you have the stereotypical .NET programmer who only codes from 9-5 making boring ""enterprise"" LOB software and only uses technology from MS. You know them, the programmers who only started using jQuery because it now comes bundled with ASP.NET. Programmers who probably can't even create a .NET project from scratch and build on the command line, but rely on the voodoo magic of File->New->Project and Build->Build Solution (F6) in Visual Studio. Does MS really want to woo these developers?<p>When all the hobbyist programmers that can't afford Visual Studio ($550+) or like .NET jumps ship to OSX/Linux, learns <i>free</i> open source tools and creates <i>billion dollar</i> startups on the OSS stack, MS is <i>fucked.</i> They lose developer mind share. The next Facebook or Google won't be made on Windows systems and MS will be left supporting dinosaurs. Windows and VS doesn't matter in a world where we live in a web browser. Developers can now develop on Linux and 'deploy' to Windows via Chrome and Firefox.<p>I think MS is finally seeing the light. NuGet is a trojan horse of change in the .NET world if MS lets it. We might actually start seeing a true open source community around .NET technology.",1314456245

There was a time I'd get people to switch from Windows to Linux; now I tell them to either upgrade to Windows 7 (if they're not on Windows 7 already) or get a Mac.<p>I'm also concerned about three secondary issues. One, there is a lack of  strong leadership in the Linux community. Shuttleworth is the only person who can shake things up, and whenever he does everyone whines as if Shuttleworth had caused them some grave personal injustice.<p>Second, of course, is fragmentation and the fact that Linux developers change things needlessly (see GNOME 3, KDE4, PulseAudio, etc.) The end result is different distros doing things in slightly incompatible ways. These days I see more and more people package their software for Ubuntu only, and provide a generic .tag.gz for other distros. I'm no Ubuntu fan, but I jump for joy every time I see this. Distros need to die.<p>Third is politics. I know people who contribute to a few high-profile open source projects and I've watched them waste their time on bikeshed discussions on mailing lists and IRC. I've even watched one guy work on a project for three months only to have the design team discard it because they had a different idea in mind. The result was a long battle between programmers and designers. I guess this is a direct result of lack of leadership.<p>I've been hearing talks about a GNOME OS. I sincerely hope the GNOME folks go ahead and build it. As I've said before, distros need to die. So much manpower is wasted on just packaging things for different distros. From a consumer standpoint, choice is okay if you have to choose between two or three things, each with their clear merits and demerits. Choice is fatal if you have to choose between ten things which are all nearly identical.<p>Sometimes I feel Linus is the only guy who knows how to run a project properly. He knows how to say ""no"".

It doesn't appear to be actively maintained. (But it is distributed as a single, readable python script that one can easily modify to taste. It spits out plain HTML, so if you ever want to ditch SHPAML, you will never be left high and dry.)<p>2. Doesn't include a round-trip translator. (Not terribly important to me.)<p>3. Like CoffeeScript and their ilk, the output line numbers don't line up with the source.<p>4. There are a few bits of gymnastics one has to do to conform to the grammar. For example, a link anchor must appear isolated on a new line to use the most absolutely tersest syntax. Since SHPAML passes HTML straight through, you can avoid this by added the standard markup.<p>5. SHPAML may not be automatically included in your workflow if you are using something like Rails or Django, but I believe there are a set of github projects that address this.",1314455871

2931546,comment,2931314,2931314,4,0,Hyena,,,"Could this article be more wrong? I took the Linux challenge last month, making Ubuntu my main OS. The experience was terrible and I switched back to Windows. Linux is still <i>almost</i> awesome and I've retained a Linux install as a ""work machine"" to keep me away from my video games very nicely. But the fact that I can successfully use Linux as an ""isolation chamber"" betrays the fact that it's really not ready for prime time at all.<p>The first thing I'd say they need to fix is installation. There should be one install protocol to rule them all. Whether the program apt-gets, installs .sh, or just sits there and runs as is, it should be forced through a setup process to remove user confusion. That might be as simple as a Python script that asks where you want to copy files, but it just needs to be consistent for every program. I never have to read an installation instruction or ReadMe on Windows, why do I have to read one on Linux?",1314455839

For that atmosphere is was great: it taught me the UNIX philosophy, I can work a command line shell and vim like a beast, I knew a lot more about OSs and programming in general than if I was using Windows, and it overall prepared me excellently for software development in the future.<p>That said, I was young and had the time to deal with its inadequacies. I could spend a whole weekend getting a driver to work properly, and fiddling with kernel options. These days I get a few hours of free time when I come home from work, and then I have my weekend. If I am on the computer at all, I don't want to waste my time dealing with that stuff any more. It's either to sit down and knock out a sizable chunk of a personal project, or play some video games for entertainment.<p>I have a proper place for all three OS flavors. My desktop runs Windows (for gaming, heavy VM work, and games development), my primary development machine is a Macbook Air (running OS X), and any servers I have run Linux. I feel like these are the perfect tools for their respective jobs, now that money isn't a factor as a poor college student. Using OSX over Linux as a development environment was like night and day.<p>For servers, Linux is king. Having it be a usable personal OS (for the average user and programmer) will take a lot more time. While it's true that most of my time is spent either in the terminal or in the browser (I'd say about 75% of my computer usage), for the other 25% paying for a machine that runs OS X is completely worth every penny twice over. The quality of tools, utilities, and applications that aren't a browser or terminal is light-years ahead of anything that Linux offers, in terms of usability, UI, and functionality.",1314454890

Certainly not 11 times - unless it was a purely stationary-type hold.<p>Also, chokeholds which result in death leave physical damage, that was not present in the autopsy (no damage to the windpipe or neckbones).<p>Eric Garner was not &quot;murdered&quot;, he died in the ambulance from the situation exacerbating his health complications.<p>Anyone who thinks he was literally &quot;murdered&quot; is racially motivated to see it as such, not based on facts nor <i>common-sense</i>, the later which the author brings up multiple times.<p>Second, as this is written anonymously and rolls a &quot;white-jury&quot; racial narrative from the start to the end, you have to consider that 9 out of the last 10 racial incidences (of the national news proportion) ended up being hoaxes done to validate someones need for there to be racism where there was none.

Smart people tend to go in depth on things in a way the average person doesn&#x27;t (generally more to laziness rather than capability). The one trait I noticed in smart people is they never just stop at the convenient answer, it has to fit into a coherent world view, and they tend to integrate ideas into larger wholes.<p>Lets say you try to explain quantum physics to a lay person. We know quantum mechanics is basically correct, but it sounds batshit insane if you try to go directly to the conclusions of quantum mechanics without starting at the first principles. You can&#x27;t just go from A-Z, you have to go A-B-C...Z. The average lay person just goes from A->&quot;wow quantum physics are weird, murdering cats and stuff&quot;<p>The thing is, we can believe some of the more outlandish claims of physics because physics is a trusted institution and we know claims are checked, etc, so we don&#x27;t need to check it ourselves.<p>So that works for science; because smart people made it work, but what happens with things that aren&#x27;t science? The same people smart enough to study quantum physics might also be just as interested in politics. So maybe their thoughts start at the mainstream, but they keep growing sideways off it in their own unique branch. In science, these branches get clipped when they&#x27;re falsified by the community, but other areas don&#x27;t really have a bar for determining the correctness of a theory, those branches don&#x27;t necessarily get trimmed.<p>Anyway, I guess my point is that if you know a very smart person and they&#x27;re saying something seemingly insane, what you&#x27;re probably hearing is step Z in their thought process, but for it to make sense you have to hear the preceding chain of thoughts A..Y that led to that. Not to say their theory is <i>right</i>, it probably is loony, but since they probably haven&#x27;t gotten anyone to critique their A..Y coherently, when they get called a crackpot they probably rightly assume that nobody quite understand what they&#x27;re getting at.",1449208049

The problem is no developer has an incentive to write a universal application that runs on all aforementioned platforms. Developers will always write apps for platforms where it makes sense. Windows has a large share of the desktop market so it is a no brainer. But why would a developer care about their app working on a phone platform with limited market share?<p>I think Windows Phone is brilliant. Well-made devices and a great operating system, but the lack of apps makes it very unattractive to the general masses. Support for Android apps without needing to be redeveloped is a no-brainer in my opinion. No developer will see the value in converting an Android app over to Windows. It has to support Android apps out-of-the-box without the developer needing to do anything or no tool, no matter how great or smart it is will make developers change their tune, even if it is easy to do so.<p>At present there is no motivation for developers to develop for Windows Phone and no incentive for customers who adopt the platform.

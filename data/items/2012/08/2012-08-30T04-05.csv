I am also physically active and exercise regularly at the gym. Yes, I am slim and lean but nowhere near to being anorexic.<p>Human mind is quite amazing at painting dreadful pictures of starvation and all sorts of miseries and suffering when it comes to depriving one of their favourite food(s).

It seems like that won't be an issue here.  An S-corporation (which is still a corporation - just a different tax status) is a way to structure yourself as a corporation without having double taxation - taxed on profit for your business, and taxed on the wages you pay yourself.  I don't recommend a sole-proprietorship because they have limited protection as a corporation (it's like personally guaranteeing a loan).  Also, you may have trouble with having it in two people's name.<p>The way I've learned about this is through various blogs, and Quora.

There are nevertheless trees around and lots of dirt--why no bridges? In West Point, why no latrines and toilet pits near or on the beach? Why is there so much systematic incompetence?<p>In the US at least much of the systematic incompetence comes from the fact many homeless people have some form of mental illness. You can excuse these people and by all means help them, some can even become quite ""normal"" and productive if they have access to medication that helps keep them stable. The rest? It's hard to find much pity for them.<p>I don't think my attitude here is particularly ""conservative"" either, but more due to an engineering personality. If there's a problem, fix it.

He did not do monetary damage to AOL, nor reputational damage (he didn't represent his work as being part of AOL or represent himself as an AOL representative to potential partners or investors).<p>In Shirley's case she allegedly convinced some people she would be able to connect them with potential investors or advisers when in fact she could not. For a startup founder that can make them think there is some additional outreach going on that isn't. If the founder feels like outreach is critical to the startups ability to succeed and they find they have squandered time, their most precious resource, with this person who couldn't deliver then I could see them feel betrayed. If you hire (and pay) a PR firm to get your message out and they say they can get you into the New York Times or Inc or whatever and it turns out they can't and never could, you may be inclined to not pay them (and possibly sue them if you had already paid them).<p>So one is 'freeloading' (the kids case) and one is fraud (Shirley's case). I see it as the difference between saying you have a million dollars in your checking account when you don't, versus writing a check for a million dollars when you don't have it. Shopping yourself into photos feels more like the latter to me, but unless you're actually paying for her services your not financially harmed.<p>I think asking the hypocrisy question is completely valid. Where does this behavior cross the line from 'white lie' into 'fraud'?<p>In my post I really was commenting on people trying suppress conversation that is painful through peer pressure. Conflict avoidance is a huge problem in society, it lets problems grow into bigger problems. I was not particularly passing judgement on Shirley's actions, although in all honestly when I read the TC article I did feel sympathy for the folks who were misled, and I didn't feel nearly as much angst for the AOL folks who didn't realize the guy was living in their office.<p>The kid's motivations were pretty clear, do you happen to have any insights into Shirleys? I'll admit I accepted the implication that she does this just to prop up her own self image, but recognize that conclusion isn't completely supported by what we know. Motive does play a huge part in how the two stories get positioned.<p>(This comes back to my comment in that previous thread : <i>When evaluating a series of events involving grey areas its always useful to try to understand the principles that are in play.

If and when it becomes effective and economic at producing firearms, nefarious institutions will not hesitate to produce them in mass quantities, no matter what the law says.  And I don't like it.  I support gun rights for law abiding citizens, not criminals.  Obviously some no-brainer laws such as restrictions due to prior felony convictions would become impossible to enforce.<p>I have spent some time considering how to prevent this eventual situation and am at a real loss.  File sharing's history has made it very clear that laws and technology cannot stop economically interested parties from finding and exploiting loopholes and weaknesses.<p>Does anyone have any ideas how we could prevent this technology from being used to arm would be felons or dangerous individuals?",1346299884

Cash salary is more directly relevant, though, with some guarantee of payout -- quitting a safe $100k/yr job for a $20k/mo job at a startup with $20k in the bank, maybe not.<p>Companies would also pick vendors based on financial stability, for which profit is probably a major factor, although cash in the bank would also be.<p>Or maybe it would happen if investment rules relaxed and private equity (Private Equity or direct investment like second market in non-public companies) happened, as communicating financials to lots of investors would still be relevant.",1346299743

This means they don't go to college, this <i>doesn't</i> mean they don't get an education, <i>especially</i> if they're already motivated to learn, and especially in the US where even the homeless can get free access to the internet if they really need it. In your scenario, if the job market continues its insistence on Bachelor's degrees they will find a quickly shortening supply and will have to loosen up that requirement to stay competitive.<p>As a compromise I'd support giving every US citizen a free netbook and rolling out free public wifi that only routes to a subset of the internet with each site hand-approved (or with a sufficiently clever algorithm from Google or someone else) to be ""of public utility for learning"" rather than entertainment. No facebook, no porn, no games, and education sites will have to host their own videos instead of using youtube (or an education-only youtube clone can appear), at least if they want the free users to see it. If you want the full internet, pay for it, which we already do. (Very inexpensive all things considered.)",1346299620

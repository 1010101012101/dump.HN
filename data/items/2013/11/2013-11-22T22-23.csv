First, you learn parsing, then you learn what actually makes a language tick.  Then you learn what goes into the design process, when you realize you&#x27;ve designed yourself into a corner.  Then you start reading up on language design, stumble across sites like Lambda-the-Ultimate.org, and find out that there is a lot more than imperative / OO programming.  Then you start getting into the Lisp literature, and reach a zen-like state.  Then you snap back to reality, and become a slightly better programmer, who is a bit more humble.",1385161038

None of the major parties even considers it as a serious option, nor is there viable public support for it. Minimum wage has widespread support in the population and during the last years the conservative party never styled itself as fundamentally opposed to minimum wage (though always only minimum wage implemented independently from government through collective bargaining where available).

6784271,comment,6783193,6783193,9,0,saumil07,,,"Sigh - yet another hiring process complaint post. As an employer hopefully I can shed some light here.<p>a) If you are trying to hire 5 engineers, say, you need to talk to ~25 candidates at least. It&#x27;s a competitive market. \nb) If you aim to talk to 25 candidates in a short period of time, you need to have SOME standard way to evaluate candidates if you don&#x27;t want to just throw darts on the board.  Being sloppy with process is bad for companies and the engineers and a waste of everyone&#x27;s time. \nc) In order to create a standard process, you have a very limited # of options to work from. I&#x27;ve seen comments like &quot;do a co-working day to get a real sense&quot; or &quot;do a contract and see them work with you daily&quot; positioned as realistic options. They are not. If an engineer has an existing full-time job they don&#x27;t have the time to do co-working days or contracts. \nd) The other options are 1) whiteboard interviews 2) coding challenges 3) some combination thereof. \ne) Lots of candidates hate whiteboard interviews. Lots of candidates hate coding challenges too. Neither is a perfect system but it&#x27;s better than doing nothing or asking for co-working time. \nf) We use coding challenges at the top end but we time-box it to 3 hours. If someone asked us to pay for the time, we would happily do so. \ng) Our coding challenges have 3 different problems so candidates can pick whichever aligns best to skills. One problem is JavaScript-heavy and 2 others are Ruby/Rails-heavy. \nh) Several engineers on the team solved the coding challenges on a timed basis before we put them out to candidates. Doing otherwise would be stupid/unfair. \ni) In the few cases where we&#x27;ve been able to do 1-2 co-working days, we have offered to pay for the candidate&#x27;s time. Not full freight consulting dollars but something that indicates our seriousness. \nj) In this case, the OP got caught by a dumb coding challenge to build a full website. But the headline paints with a broad brush because coding challenges by themselves are not evil. They are a tool that can be used well or poorly. That&#x27;s all.",1385160599

The schools, a local fiber provider and our company cooperated to submit the grant proposal and the USF funds ended up offsetting enough of the equipment/infrastructure costs that the schools and SP could agree on a rate that the schools could afford.<p>The last of our systems (that I was involved with) was installed in about 2000 but stopped the organization overseeing those services held applications for (from memory) about 18 months.  I&#x27;m not aware of how the funds are distributed now (if at all) but I know for a while some of the schools we&#x27;d connected complained that they were no longer receiving their subsidies.  I do know that the fee remained on my telephone bill.<p>So the question is &quot;why didn&#x27;t the infrastructure installed using USF funds lead to lower prices for consumers?&quot;.  I think the answer is that Internet pricing for home service in the U.S. is too lucrative - no guarantees on service (yes, you&#x27;re quoted maximum through-puts but those can be affected by your neighbors) and relatively large bills.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund</a>",1385160171

I don&#x27;t know how valid the general idea is, but when it came to Turntable, it worked. People search the space of musical works much more effectively than algorithms.<p>And then Turntable did nothing with that power.

However, audits are retrospective--you don&#x27;t need IRS permission to claim capital gains rates on your return.  You simply need to have supporting documentation to defeat an audit <i>if</i> the IRS audits your return and challenges to applicability of the capital gains rates.<p>I refer only to wallets held on exchanges above because wallets held privately or in the US generally don&#x27;t incur compliance obligations under the FBAR (foreign bank accounts) or FATCA (foreign financial assets) information reporting regimes.   Specifically, the issue is that the FBAR and FATCA reporting regimes apply to accounts held in foreign financial institutions.  Any business that holds financial assets for others is considered a financial institution, so any exchange offering bitcoin wallet services should be a financial institution under these laws. Because all of the major bitcoin exchanges are foreign, FBAR and FATCA reporting becomes an issue for U.S. taxpayers.  The threshold for having a FBAR reporting obligation is $10,000, and for FATCA is $50,000.  In both cases, the value of foreign accounts or assets is translated to USD.<p>Note also that financial institutions are actually defined somewhat differently for FBAR vs FATCA contexts. Bitcoin payment processors appear to be financial institutions in the FBAR context, but not in the FATCA context.  However, all of the major payment processors are US-based, so FBAR and FATCA don&#x27;t apply.  Generally, U.S. tax law doesn&#x27;t require you to disclose your domestic assets (the income is what matters.)",1385159121

Trust me, when this &quot;test&quot; was first suggested, I was wary of it myself and did everything in my power to make it very achievable. That&#x27;s why I considered it a joke, it was not nearly difficult enough to assess the level of seniority this candidate was claiming. This was someone with 10+ years of development experience, in the same field, experience with the language and environment we used. On paper and even on the phone, he made himself sound like the perfect candidate. In fact, before the on-site interview, I thought he had it in the bag and was excited to get some help on the team.<p>The SDKs in question were for a camera (to get images from the camera) and OpenCV, which is well known in imaging circles. The test was to receive a video stream from the camera (there was an example showing how to do this and I made it clear I didn&#x27;t mind if he made that example his starting point) and to subtract consecutive images to create an image representing the &quot;difference&quot; between the two images. Not a meaningful result and one could barely call it image processing, but it would show us the candidates abilities to interact with multiple well-documented SDKs to accomplish a very simple task. If someone who claims to have years of experience with image processing can&#x27;t accomplish subtracting two consecutive images and drawing the result to the screen, given all the tools to do this, there&#x27;s a big problem.<p>Our new grad was mostly a tester and an occasional developer. He had less than a year of experience. He completed in 20 minutes without supervision.<p>>Instead, what I gather from your story is that your company prefers candidates who practice cowboy, shoot-from-the-hip programming instead of thoughtfully approaching a new, unfamiliar SDK and pondering how it might be used to solve problems related to the domain it was built for, then applying this thoughtful process to provide a solution to a problem. In fact, if I&#x27;m given a non-trivial SDK and told &quot;write a program that does X using this SDK; you have one hour&quot;, my response might be something very similar to the above, directed at the person giving the &quot;assignment&quot; out, followed by a polite but firm indication that the company doesn&#x27;t meet <i>my</i> requirements.<p>While I am fully aware that there are severe limitations to the usefulness of a test like this, in this situation, it saved us from a terrible hire (this test wasn&#x27;t the only indication that he wasn&#x27;t who he claimed to be).<p>In all honesty, you sound like a fairly thorny/difficult person to work with and in your hypothetical scenario where the test caused you spurn the position, it would have inadvertently done its job.",1385158405

Making sense of feedback from playtesters who were not always in our target audience<p>3. Importance of having beautiful art<p>4. Making natural-sounding effects<p>5. Writing music to go along with an existing theme<p>Long version:<p>Well, my friend learned to code by starting this project, so that was the first big obstacle. That meant that the development cycle of the game was much longer than lean-startup, rapid-iteration ideas floating around here would have it.<p>Related to that was the difficulty of making sense of the feedback we got from playtesters. It would have been easier if we were still in college, but we had a hard time getting feedback from people who were in our target audience, namely people who play mobile games at all. We asked everyone we knew to play the game, and it was psychologically difficult to separate out feedback that was probably not relevant because it came from someone who would never buy the game in the first place. For example, many people thought it was too hard, but they were often not really people who play games in the first place. This was made doubly hard by the fact that we&#x27;ve played the game so much, so we couldn&#x27;t trust ourselves to know what was too hard or too easy. We didn&#x27;t do anything special to solve this — no &quot;7 Ways To Get Out of Your Own Way&quot; blog post is coming out of this. Essentially we did the best we could.<p>Another interesting thing was just how central it is to have beautiful art. It sounds obvious but it&#x27;s one of those things you don&#x27;t completely grok until it happens to you. Before the artist came on board, we had a well-designed protoype, and we retained the majority of the original design (enormously to the founder&#x27;s credit). But perfect execution by a talented artist makes for an incredible difference in emotional appeal. I wouldn&#x27;t call this a difficulty, since the art came out so well. But it was a lesson.<p>I was in charge of the sound and music, and that ended up being surprisingly difficult too. You would never know without trying to do it yourself how hard it is to come up with sounds that feel natural in context and aren&#x27;t distracting or annoying. I&#x27;d say we ended up with fewer sound effects than I would have liked for that reason.<p>The music was hard too. I had experience with rock music, but I had never written any piece of music to go along with a pre-existing theme and mood. So writing the main theme to have a French feel but with the right amount of levity took a lot of iteration. And the level background music has to be catchy enough to be fun and motivating, but not so catchy that it prevents the player from concentrating on the game. Furthermore, I&#x27;m not a great keyboard player, but I used a keyboard to record all the tracks and in order to get the timing right I had to do literally hundreds of takes and slice and dice the music pretty finely.",1385158252

I worked on it about half-an-hour coming up with the algorithm. And then for some reason my brain keyed in on the &quot;write a program&quot; part of the question. So I wrote the following in C++ (from memory so may not be exact) -<p><pre><code>  int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n      std::cout \n          << &quot;Man takes chicken, leaves fox and corn, and returns&quot; << std::endl\n          << &quot;Man takes fox, leaves corn, and returns with chicken&quot; << std::endl\n          << &quot;Man leaves chicken and takes corn, leaves corn with fox, and returns&quot; << std::endl\n          << &quot;Man takes chicken back across&quot; << std::endl;\n      return 0;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIt was a program that would tell the man the correct way to get everything across the river.<p>Must have been an OK answer because I got flown up and ended up working for them for 4 years (before a series of bad jobs that have finally lead back to something good).",1385158115

Gain is measured the same way it is with any other asset (including any non-USD currency): sale price less acquisition cost (aka &quot;cost basis&quot; in tax parlance) and certain maintenance expenses.  There are other adjustments which probably aren&#x27;t applicable to digital currency. In this case, it doesn&#x27;t appear that w was entirely y or z coins, and probably includes coins from both groups.  Since the z have a different acquisition cost, generally the calculation is split into smaller sub-calculations to the extent the data is available (gain on sale of the y coins sold, and gain on sale of the z coins sold).  The cost basis of goods acquired as compensation is generally the amount treated as income for other tax purposes, usually the fair market value.<p>If a = y coins sold and b = z coins sold, then gain should be...<p>=[sales price allocable to a coins - purchase purchase allocable to a coins] + [sales price allocable to b coins - purchase purchase allocable to b coins]<p>=[[a/w * w sales price - [a/y* y purchase price]] + [b/w * w sales price - [b/z* z purchase price]<p>2) It should be possible to add the cost of the cracker into the &quot;cost basis&quot; of the xxx-w coins, which should affect the amount of taxable gain on a later sale of some or all of those coins.  However, there should not be any immediate or current year tax implications.<p>3) There are some write-offs for lost or stolen goods.  Don&#x27;t know how applicable they would be to digital goods like Bitcoin since nobody has actually gotten to that point yet! It&#x27;s not really been established whether digital goods can be &quot;lost&quot; for tax purposes.  If analogizing the tangible property, its likely that a court would eventually say they can be lost and thus written-off, but no courts actually gone out and said it...yet.

Apple accelerated it&#x27;s death but it was doomed anyway.<p>I&#x27;m now a javascript dev and could not find any front-end framework that came close to the ease of use and consistent functionality that flex provided.<p>- Language<p>As for back-end stack, node.js all the way. Javascript has a lot of caveats but it&#x27;s fun to work with (compared to other languages).<p>Java is too verbose and too objectish. POJOs ? come-on, it&#x27;s almost 2014. Factory factory factory ? come-on... But the language is powerful. Anything needing transactions, JVM all the way... Java or Scala is another question I can&#x27;t really answer.<p>Ruby is nowhere near lightweight as node (bundle install PITA, server start PITA). PHP is powerful but there is something wrong with the language (can&#x27;t really pinpoint what the problem is). Python I have never used but now I tend to disregard non async language.<p>Believe it or not, I was a java dude and javascript hater. Now I&#x27;m a javascript dude and java hater.<p>I also think that Javascript/HTML are just waiting for a kick in the but and a replacement. Have you played with front-end frameworks/library ? What a piece of... mess. Only AngularJS seems ok-ish. The web needs fixing. Google is giving it some tries (Dart, Go).<p>You&#x27;ll find hundredfolds the amount of opinions as there are languages or frameworks or libraries or IDEs. The most important is to stay curious and open minded. Don&#x27;t forget to take a step back on the technologies you use. It allows to give the right advice and make the right technical decision. Most of us are wrong more open than not. When you realise you&#x27;re wrong, you learn and can move forward.<p>- IDE:<p>My advice: if you feel like it, learn either vi or emacs. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone use a higher level IDE (including me, I use Webstorm, used to use Idea) as productively as vi/emacs users do. Also, vi/emacs users love their tool with passion. That says something about these pieces of software..\nWhen I was working with c++, emacs was awesome and eclipse wouldn&#x27;t even load the project. Then I learned to be lazy and use the mouse with IntelliJ. It&#x27;s ok but their vision of what an IDE should be is getting further and further from what <i>I</i> think it should be (ie, don&#x27;t try to replace the command line). However now I got even too lazy to go back to emacs..<p>And you know what ? The 1990&#x27;s called and want their eclipse IDE back. I hope someone with an objective view can contradict me but eclipse is what a dell is to a mac. It&#x27;s good, some people use it but it feels it&#x27;s been developed with no real strategic vision of what an IDE should be. Lastlym keep an eye on online IDEs. A friend thinks it&#x27;s the future. I&#x27;m not so sure but he is smarter than I am... Same for Light Table, keep an eye on it or even start using it. The guys behind it seems to have an unusual vision and smart enough for it to be really worthy of our time.<p>Now I realise I may have overstepped the answer to the question so I&#x27;ll stop here :)<p>Cheers !<p>edit: paragraphs & indentation for readability",1385157721

Where they harm motorists&#x27; privacy, we can reasonably see them as a failure in the design and implementation of the license plate system.<p>If we had a license plate system that let people responsible for accidents and traffic infractions be identified and that ensured cars were safe without also making it easy to figure out individual people&#x27;s travel patterns, I&#x27;d view that as a strict improvement over the status quo -- and more legitimate, because it wouldn&#x27;t impose unrelated burdens on motorists.<p>Right now we&#x27;re creating and deploying lots of other systems that assign unique identifiers to people and their possessions.  Those systems are meant for specific purposes, which their users may see as legitimate, but designing them in the simplest, most obvious way will cause collateral damage to privacy by allowing often invisible kinds of tracking and profiling of people&#x27;s activities, whereabouts, and relationships.

There is such a thing as bad culture.  We don&#x27;t have details on why there wasn&#x27;t a &quot;cultural fit,&quot; so its hard to say for certain, but if the culture was preventing successful execution of a project that the company was invested in, then I would say that the culture should be adjusted.

6016500,comment,6015326,6016383,5,0,Dewie,,,"> For example, you&#x27;ve got an associative map data type and you find an element in there. At the time of writing the code you &quot;knew&quot; that the element &quot;has to be there&quot;. Haskell makes you deal with the possibility that it&#x27;s not. Won&#x27;t most developers just end up throwing an exception in that case so they don&#x27;t have to deal with the impossible possibility? Then, x months from now when the code gets changed so that the map won&#x27;t have the element there, all the sudden your code gets an error. How is this different from a null pointer exception in any other language?<p>I don&#x27;t understand. You&#x27;re saying that there is a mismatch between what the programmer knows and what the compiler can deduce? That you know, from the state the program must be in, that the map <i>has</i> to contain the value associated with the given key? I can&#x27;t think of an example were that would be the case off the top of my head.<p>I guess a similar case is if you have to perform the head function (take first element) on a list, and you <i>know</i> that the list is non-empty. If you weren&#x27;t sure, then if you don&#x27;t check that the list is non-empty before taking head on the list, you might get an error at runtime from taking head on an empty list, which is undefined in Haskell, but in a dependently typed language is impossible to even do at runtime (much like null pointer exceptions are impossible to get in Haskell).<p>Why would you throw an exception in Java? If you&#x27;re sure that a value will be returned (as opposed to a sentinel value... aka null pointer), then just happily dereference it.<p>You seem to be coming at this from a weird angle. The Maybe type let&#x27;s you statically mark all things that <i>might</i> be &quot;null&quot;, which is a big improvement from the Wild Wild West of <i></i>everthing<i></i> might be null. Now you seem to be coming at this from the &quot;how does this make dealing with the semantics of absent values easier?&quot;, to which I guess, no, it doesn&#x27;t. You still have to mull out what you should do if things are missing, or if they deviate from the normal. But you can throw exceptions, define things that you don&#x27;t want to deal with or that truly are undefined, as simply &quot;undefined&quot;, much like in most other languages.",1373414138

The issuance of the warrant is not adversarial. However, due to the exclusionary rule, a warrant can be overturned after the fact. Not only does this exclude evidence obtained from the warranted search, it also provides an incentive for police and judges to maintain high standards for warrants. Thus, there is a strong adversarial component in the process, and it&#x27;s an essential one.<p>> Of course, this isn&#x27;t actually true; every sitting FISC judge was approved by the Senate, since FISC judges are appointed from the federal bench.<p>But Congress has not had a chance to downvote their appointment to the FISC.

6016472,comment,6012450,6012450,2,0,graycat,,,"I watched the whole video.<p>She has very pretty hands!  To play all that atonal
music with such facility, she is at least really
good with piano.  That she can sing that atonal
music so well is astounding.  And her drawing is
amazing:  The <i>art</i> she gets in her drawing, e.g.,
the little cup with legs, is surprisingly good; it
looks like she could effortlessly be a famous
cartoonist.<p>Beyond her talents and skills, her knowledge of
music is amazing.<p>But, then, as far as I can tell about what she was
intending to say about music, heavily I don&#x27;t
believe her.  It appears to me that somewhere, at
home, at Stony Brook, somewhere, she got a view of
music that throws out the baby and drinks the
bathwater.  From what I can understand about what
she is saying, I believe that she is missing most of
what is really important in music.  She seems
to have some formality overwhelming reality.<p>It appeared that one of her main points was that
music before atonality was somehow <i>merely tonal</i>
and, thus, by 1900 or so played out, over with, and
needed a <i>new direction</i>, e.g., atonality.  I don&#x27;t
believe that.<p>For an analogy, from all I can tell, what she is
saying is that everything that can be said in the
English language has already been said so that, to
say anything new, we need another language.  Next,
the <i>content</i> is not really in what is said anyway
but just in what the reader reads into what is said.
So, it&#x27;s enough just to say random things.  So, that
we don&#x27;t confuse with English, we will say the
random things in a new, undefined language of
gibberish no one has seen before.<p>Nonsense.  We are not anywhere near the limits of
what can be said in English.  The bottleneck is
having something to say, not the language to use to
say it.<p>Well, there&#x27;s a <i>language</i> in Western music.  Here
is a little of it:  Pick two keys on a piano that
are right next to each other; it may be that both
keys are white or one is black and the other is
white, but in any case they are next to each other.
Then to a good approximation the fundamental
frequency of the key on the right will be the
twelfth root of 2 times the fundamental frequency of
the key on the left.  That frequency ratio is a
<i>semi-tone</i>.  A frequency ratio of the sixth root of
2, that is, two semi-tones, is a <i>whole tone</i>.  If
start on a note and go up tone, tone, semi-tone,
tone, tone, tone, semi-tone, then have gone up in
frequency by a factor of 2 (interval of an <i>octave</i>)
and have played the notes of the <i>major scale</i> of
the note you started on and ended on -- that note is
called the <i>tonic</i> of that scale.  You will be
playing the notes of the <i>major key</i> of that tonic.<p>Of course for historical reasons, nearly all those
frequency ratios are surprisingly well approximated
by <i>perfect tuning</i> via ratios of small whole
numbers.  In particular, as at Google,<p><pre><code>     2**(7/12) = 1.49830707688
</code></pre>
which is close to 3/2 which is 7 semi-tones, called
a <i>perfect fifth</i>, and how the main string
instruments -- violin, viola, cello -- in an
orchestra are tuned.<p>If you start on the note C and go up the major
scale, then you will play on only the white keys and
will be playing in the key of C major.<p>If you want to play some simple music, then pick a
note as the tonic, start on that note, play the
other notes in the major scale of that tonic but
avoiding the tonic, but, when want to end, return to
the tonic.  That&#x27;s done so often in Western music
that everyone will quickly detect which note is the
tonic (or one step more advanced, which notes are
candidates for the tonic) and notice that when you
return to the tonic the music has finished something
and maybe just ended.  All that is part of the
<i>language</i> of Western music.  And there&#x27;s much more
such language that we have all <i>learned</i> if only by
association from lots of exposure.<p>But atonality largely discards that language.  Then,
someone who knows only English or is writing for
people who know only English, discarding English
essentially stops communications, and that&#x27;s why
it&#x27;s super tough to hear any <i>communication</i> in
atonal music.  Yes, the music is <i>new and different</i>
but so would be dropping a pile of brittle dishes on
the floor, and in both cases the sound is <i>new</i> only
because before everyone was smart enough to avoid
making such a sound.<p>For music, yes, it mostly doesn&#x27;t mean anything
definite, specific, and unambiguous literally.
Mostly.  But, of course, in the Sibelius <i>Finlandia</i>
or the R. Strauss <i>Ein Heldenleben</i> it is fairly
unambiguous what is being said, including the
machine gun fire in <i>Finlandia</i> and the personality
of the girl in <i>Ein Heldenleben</i>.<p>For something still with <i>meaning</i> but more
ambiguous, in the D major section of the Bach
<i>Chaconne</i> for solo violin, there is a lot of use of
repeated notes, especially A and D, three notes or
four notes, and finally some repeated chords.<p>But what to make of the repetition?  One approach is
to regard them as <i>insistent</i>, increasingly so
during the section, underlining the short passages
between the repeated notes, passages that are
similar but with some variation.  It could be music
from impassioned speaking, saying much the same
thing over and over, more and more strongly, with
the repeated notes/chords between as insistent
emphasis.<p>At one point, the music suddenly changes, as if
exhausted from the passion, and plays just some more
consonant major thirds (D and F#, that is, an
interval of two whole tones) with some short
descending passages.  Then the drama increases again
with some repeated chords to the climax of the piece
before a D minor section that starts with a confused
<i>catharsis</i>.<p>So, for an <i>interpretation</i>, the music is from
something intense going on, building up, becoming
insistent, somehow trying to get some <i>resolution</i>
one way or another, finally, with a big effort,
doing so, and then receding to a catharsis.<p>One view is that the music is screaming out to the
heavens about the intensity of the human spirit.
Some might guess, but I don&#x27;t see a good fit, is
that the music was a representation of Bach working
to add one more to his family.  Either way, it&#x27;s
passionate music; the closest of anything else I
know of is the <i>Chaconne</i> of Vitali, and it is quite
different.  No, I don&#x27;t find Stravinsky&#x27;s <i>Le sacre
du printemps</i> close.<p>There is an old story that composer
Castelnuovo-Tedesco regarded the Bach <i>Chaconne</i> as
the &quot;greatest piece of music ever written&quot;.  I can
see many issues in interpretation in that music, but
I see nothing that suggests that the level of art in
the music was constrained by tonality.<p>Net, I don&#x27;t see that tonal music, even the quite
old version of it Bach used, either inhibited or
exhausted new musical expression.<p>To understand better, we need to back up from just
keys, tonality, chord progressions, etc. and notice
that heavily music is <i>art</i> as in the classic
definition <i>the communication, interpretation of
human experience, emotion</i>.  So, the listener gets a
<i>vicarious emotional experience</i> or sometimes in
particular something that <i>speaks to part of their
life</i>, that is, confirms that others have faced the
same things, or at least similar emotions, thus,
confirming, possibly comfortingly, for the listener
that they are not alone.<p>When Rostropovich first went to Berlin to play with
von Karajan, for just what was <i>meant</i> in how
Rostropovich started the second movement of the
Dvork concerto I don&#x27;t know, but he, von Karajan,
and several soloists in the orchestra seemed to have
the same <i>musical communications</i> in mind, and that
communication <i>speaks</i> effectively and directly to
me about some parts of my life.  So, Rostropovich
achieved an effective communication in a <i>universal</i>
language.<p>With this definition of art and with the essentially
endless range of human experience, emotion, there is
an endless range of music to communicate, interpret,
new music, not written yet, including with tonality
the same as used by any of Vivaldi, Bach, Mozart,
Beethoven, Rossini, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Puccini,
..., Wagner, J. Strauss, R. Strauss, Rachmaninoff,
Stravinsky, and more.  Great, new music is no more
limited by tonality than new information is limited
by English; being atonal is no help for good, new
art in music but, like replacing English with
gibberish, a nearly insurmountable obstacle.<p>There is a lot of quite good art available mostly in
just performance, with very old tonality; can get
plenty of communication, interpretation of human
experience, emotion, awash in passion, pathos,
poignancy, sympathy, empathy, identification, etc.<p>E.g., there is the Kelly Pickler <i>I Wonder</i>:<p><pre><code>     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb9mvkxE5Ww
</code></pre>
That with her hair, face, and figure, with the right
hair stylist and dress selection, in places she is
able to look a lot like Marilyn Monroe is nearly
irrelevant.  Instead, this music is a heart rending
portrayal of a pretty, young woman, who still
regards herself as a &quot;little girl&quot;, suffering from
feeling neglected by her mother.  It&#x27;s endearing.
Standard emotional reactions include sympathy,
empathy.  Men, in particular, are supposed to feel
protective, but some will see weakness and
dependency and sense an opportunity for an easy
<i>score</i>.  And the music works, well.  There is no
end to such human experience, emotion to be
interpreted, communicated.<p>That Kelly Pickler art really is new:  Sure, the
tonality is old, really old, and the harmony may be
just a cliche; in tonality we&#x27;re certainly not
listening to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Prelude&quot; to <i>Tristan und
Isolde</i>; still, I assure you from my many stacks of
recorded music from vinyl to CDs and the Internet,
from Vivaldi through Rachmaninoff to the present, as
art that Pickler video is new and at least good.<p>So, even recent popular music, with no pretensions
at <i>serious</i> music, and using old tonalities and
cliche harmonies, can still be good as art.  Net,
it&#x27;s still quite possible, even in Nashville popular
music, to do good art with old tonalities.<p>The main point is the art; tonality is not a
limitation; and atonality is no help to better art.",1373413581

The usual rule of thumb is that a runtime exception (at least in pure code) is for bugs in the code and explicit methods like Maybe are for bugs in the input. So if getting a Nothing from your  map means your own code is broken, an exception is perfectly fine; if it means your code was called wrong, you want to just return a Maybe.<p>In practice, most of the time, you end up either coming up with a default or returning the Maybe. This is greatly helped by the fact that just propagating Maybe value is really easy because Maybe is a member of a bunch of standard typeclasses like Applicative, Alternative and Monad. Thanks to this, I&#x27;ve found most of my code follows a simple pattern: it pushes the maybe values through until it has a meaningful default. This is safe, simple and fairly elegant. At some point, I either pattern match against it or use a function like fromMaybe, which then allows me to plug everything back into normal code.",1373413452

These are highly flexible monikers.<p>I think if you understand Locke, natural law, some Hobbes, and the writings of Jefferson you get the picture well enough. No need to make this into a ink-blot test.<p>&quot;...The posture of Federalist Nos. 9-10 are clear: Hamilton and Madison are making the case for representative, republican government...A libertarian government, at least as I understand it, approaches the question from the opposite direction: the protection of individual rights is the first and foremost concern, and sole purpose, of government...&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;re creating a false dichotomy here when there&#x27;s only a natural tension. A representative, republican government is the most efficient and longest lasting chance the nation had of preserving individual rights. More to the point, though, Madison and Hamilton were describing and promoting their proposed structure, not political theory. The entire discussion was around whether their structure would work or not. (I note that the anti-federalists, like many libertarians throughout history, were labeled as having farcical and far-fetched ideas of dangers that never would actually occur. Those guys turned out to be more right than wrong.)<p>It was up to the ratifying bodies to align the constitution with what everybody already knew -- the ideals expressed in the DOI by Jefferson and penned by half a dozen philosophers during the Enlightenment. Hence the BOR.<p>I don&#x27;t want to get into a long discussion of ratification. HN isn&#x27;t the place for it. But little-l libertarians trace their lineage back to both sides of the constitutional debates, and back farther than that. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find anybody wearing a hat that says &quot;libertarian&quot; on it in 1787, but if we sat down and described these things that libertarians believe, I&#x27;d bet 95% of the founders would be on-board. There is no argument to be had here. There&#x27;s no direct opposition, but there&#x27;s always tension between personal freedom and structure. That&#x27;s what the constitution was: one of the best and most effective compromises man has come up with so far. Libertarians believe in that compromise, and because so many of the founders were libertarians, we got a good one.",1373412830

That&#x27;s just bad teaching.&quot;<p>Exams are supposed to be non-trivial, if they are to test your understanding of the material. When I teach freshman calculus, I invariably get this kind of comments from students who aced math in high school because they had basically memorized all possible question patterns from the textbook. But did they understand it? More often than not, they hadn&#x27;t, really. And when they get a question that doesn&#x27;t fit a pattern they&#x27;ve seen before, they call it a &quot;trick&quot;, when it&#x27;s anything but.<p>I work hard at getting my students to understand that math is not about memorizing stuff but about understanding stuff. You have to know the basic concepts and techniques by heart, of course, same as any subject, but anything more is just icing (unless your brain works in such a way that memorizing patterns helps you understand general principles, in which case memorize away, but don&#x27;t mistake the means for the end.<p>Many students tell me they don&#x27;t understand why they got a failing mark on an exam because they did all the homework and/or put in tens of hours of study. They seem to think that these actions should somehow guarantee them a passing grade, and if it didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s obviously because the exam was unfair.<p>Now let me be perfectly clear: I don&#x27;t give <i>hard</i> exams. In fact, most of the questions I ask are downright easy, provided you understand the material. Here&#x27;s an example: &quot;Sketch the graph of a twice-differentiable function f(x) whose domain is the real numbers and which satisfies the following two conditions: f&#x27;(x) is negative for all x, and f&#x27;&#x27;(x) always has the same sign as x.&quot; This was in fact a question in my calc 1 midterm last year.<p>Out of 60 students, 10 did not write anything. 10 drew something that was not the graph of a function. 10 drew a function that did not satisfy any of the requirements. 10 drew a decreasing function but got the concavity wrong somehow. 20 gave a correct answer. (This is all approximate, of course.) The average mark for this question was probably around 2/5.<p>Was this exam question harder than my homework problem sets? Absolutely not! It&#x27;s just different. Here&#x27;s an example of a homework question relating to the same material in a similar way: &quot;A differentiable function f(x) is such that f&#x27;(x) never changes sign. What can be said about the number of zeros of f?&quot; This is more difficult than the exam question because the step linking the sign of f&#x27; to the number of zeros of f (drawing a graph) is not explicitly suggested, and because the answer is &quot;f has at most one zero&quot; and not &quot;f has exactly one zero&quot;.",1373412636

Anders Ericsson&#x27;s original work. Ericsson qualified the 10,000 hours saying that it had to be a certain type of deliberative practice, and that there was a limit of about 4 hours per day which could be spent on it.<p>In other words, it has never been the case that 10,000 hours is all that&#x27;s needed, only that that is a minimum number.<p>However, you reject here Ericsson&#x27;s entire thesis, that being summarized in the Time article as &quot;Ericsson doesnt deny that genetic limitations, such as those on height and body size, can constrain expert performance in areas like athletics  and his research has shown this. However, he believes there is no good evidence so far that proves that genetic factors related to intelligence or other brain attributes matter when it comes to less physically driven pursuits.&quot;<p>You made a claim that &quot;innate talent or intellectual capacity&quot; is essential to being an expert. This is a widely held belief, first articulated (I&#x27;m told) in Vasari&#x27;s &quot;The Lives of the Artist&quot; (1568). The debate is - where is the evidence which justifies this widely held belief?<p>You see a danger in promoting this &quot;meritocracy&quot; ideal. I have two objections to that. First, I think you are using the term incorrectly. Suppose we only have innate talents as part of our genetic nature. Under a meritocracy, those who are naturally smarter, etc. will get a better job or higher position than those who aren&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t make a difference if it was achieved through deliberative practice or innate nature. Instead, I think the better word is &#x27;egalitarianism.&#x27;<p>Second, it reminds me too much of various view of &quot;noble blood&quot; and rusty arguments that women by nature can&#x27;t do X, that black people by nature can&#x27;t do Y, and that Swedes are by nature dumb squareheads. There&#x27;s any number of these stereotypes once fervently held to be true, but which haven&#x27;t stood up to the test of time.<p>Also, there shouldn&#x27;t be a good argument that &quot;people just need to try harder.&quot; Ericsson&#x27;s view is that &quot;deliberate practice requires effort and does not lead to immediate reward&quot; (quoting from a summary by David Zach Hambrick). There are many good reasons to not become an expert on a topic, including: 1) the person could be interested in becoming an expert in another topic, 2) it can be hard to find the 10,000 hours needed for practice, especially if that time is spent making money needed for rent and food, and 3) other requirements may be missing; it&#x27;s hard to be an expert surfer if one lives in Colorado, or downhill skier in Miami.<p>The path towards being an expert in anything is chaotic. I am one of the world experts in writing software for a certain subset of biochemistry. But had I gotten a different job just out of college, I would probably be in a completely different field. It&#x27;s really hard for me to believe that I was born with this talent, given how much education and job-related experience I had through to get to this point.",1373412567

Perhaps they should have included an earlier human intervention option.<p>Comments regarding the risks drivers bear going out in a storm also merit some attention. Possible responses that come to mind easily:<p>* Cut the margin the company takes off the fee
* Allow drivers to enable some form of hazard rate when things get dicey
* Providing additional advice and hotlines and such things has nothing at all to do with rates, and gets PR points, if Hailo&#x27;s experience is any indication<p>I&#x27;m sure the rest of y&#x27;all can come up with more suggestions. The point is that demand pricing is not evil, but PR costs matter.",1373412269

But my argument is that it won&#x27;t <i>confirm</i> that the US engages in certain activities. The latter would probably be much more harmful. And it&#x27;s not as if enemies can intuit what we <i>are</i> doing by process of elimination. The only things they can eliminate by studying the law are those things that are illegal. That still leaves open the truly vast number of lawful strategic possibilities. Thus, enemies are not likely to be able to guess our moves just because a handful of things are precluded by law.<p>With respect to your chess analogy, the set of possible and reasonable moves is much smaller. So yes, knowing that an artificial limitation is imposed on your opponent&#x27;s moves would be very helpful in a chess game, where players generally only have a handful of reasonable moves per turn. But that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a proper analogy for something like counterterrorism strategy.<p>And thus, I do think the harm to US interests would be negligible. We probably face a much greater risk by, for example, publishing the layouts of our streets and the names of our elected representatives than by publishing legal opinions. Street layouts can be used to plan terrorist attacks and invasions; the names of elected officials are a key ingredient to assassination attempts.

6016343,comment,6015635,6016260,17,0,dragonwriter,,,"> How does this process differ from domestic criminal law?<p>Warrants in domestic criminal law are targeted at gathering evidence to be used in adversarial legal proceedings in which the target will have the opportunity to see the evidence against him and challenge its providence. And, because of the exclusionary rule, succesfully challenging the validity of the warrants in those adversarial proceedings can nullify the value to the executive of the warrant and the gathered evidence. This encourages circumspection on the part of the government in seeking warrants, since misrepresentation in the course of seeking the warrant can backfire when they attempt to use the evidence, even though the warrant process itself is non-adversarial.<p>This is decidedly not the case with FISA warrants; information gathered through them is, by design, principally supports extrajudicial action rather than adversarial legal proceedings. As such, there is little constraint on the executive with regard to FISC warrants.<p>> What enforcement mechanisms does FISC have, and might those methods involve transactions with the federal courts in general?<p>FISC warrants (what is at issue here) do not have enforcement mechanisms, as they are simply permission for the executive to engage in surveillance.<p>> Doesn&#x27;t Google have standing to sue the USG in addition to petitioning the FISC (in the manner, for instance, described by the Yahoo disclosure the NYT ran a couple weeks ago)?<p>Not with regard to FISC warrants. Perhaps with regard to pen registers and trap-and-trace orders under FISA, issued by a judge (or magistrate judge) of the FISC, but those are distinct from surveillance warrants.<p>> Similarly, don&#x27;t the electronic providers have ways to engage the federal courts on the issue of gag orders?<p>If you refer to the gag order that is <i>mandated by FISA</i> with regard to any pen register and trap-and-trace orders issued under FISA -- see 18 USC  1842(d)(2)(B)(ii)(I) -- other than challenging the constitutionality of FISA itself, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much room to engage on that issue.",1373411904

So break out the pet theories: evil bankers, corporations controlling the government, one party or the other out to set up a kingship, GW Bush policies continues to destroy the country -- whatever emotional baggage they&#x27;re dragging around, they&#x27;re bringing it to this discussion.<p>This is a <i>really</i> bad thing because it trivializes the entire issue. Ezra Klein the other day was talking about FISC judges mostly being Republican, as if the problem here were not that we have the FISA court in the first place, but that the wrong people are on it!<p>(I find a bit of self-referential critques to all of this; it seems the charges being leveled are those the authors would be most guilty of themselves given the chance, but I digress)<p>This guy wants to go on a riff about how the select few -- our betters -- are making these incredible decisions about the disaster we&#x27;ve created.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear about this: the government keeping detailed records of all the communication and movement of each citizen is not okay, even if 90% of the country voted for it. It&#x27;s not okay because a democracy cannot survive in a perpetual state of war, and once we are at war with the population itself, it&#x27;s never going to end well. Police counter-intelligence is one thing. There are probably 10K people in the US that need secret files and should be watched because they are dangerous. Fishing expeditions against huge databases of facts from years ago regarding any random citizen are out of the question. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s bad or makes me angry. It&#x27;s that it doesn&#x27;t work. The system is unsustainable over the long-term.<p>So kudos to the author for being outraged and making a point about the system broken. I encourage whoever it is to stick around and learn to articulate the good parts of the system as well as the shitty parts. Learn the difference between what a lot of the rhetoric folks read, like about the judges being unaccountable, and what the reality actually is. Otherwise it&#x27;s just more mindless ranting.

There&#x27;s no way the few hours of extra income will make up for the lost business over time.<p>Plus, Uber depends on a lack of regulation to operate. Doing stuff that only helps the argument for regulation, and makes them look bad in the public eye, could be suicidal for their business model.",1373411634

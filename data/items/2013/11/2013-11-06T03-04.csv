As a baseline, medical procedures should be for the benefit of a patient and performed with their consent, otherwise they are inappropriate and a breach of professional ethics.<p>This is already enforced stringently in one very narrow domain: licensed doctors cannot assist states in either conducting, or even planning the preparations for, their processes of death penalty by lethal injection. This has caused them some practical problems, because they basically have to get amateur doctors to give advice. The AMA&#x27;s rationale is that executing someone is not a legitimate medical treatment, and definitely doesn&#x27;t have consent.

I hit a suspect page last night, noscript blocked a number of objects, and at no point did I open a word doc, but... it was a link masquerading as am imgur link, that bounced me off at least two redirects (one of which was a .ir domain) before landing me on a spammy-looking blog.<p>So, I guess the question is, how paranoid should I be?

It already exists and we can just move it at will. One thing to do is to exploit it by organizing new matches with maybe some adjustments to qualification system (and maybe even getting rid of incumbent advantage). Other thing which author proposes is just scratching it all off and start a new thing - this new thing being yet another tournament (with it being long bringing disadvantages I wrote about in other post).
Again, it&#x27;s like scratching Wimbledon because it&#x27;s on grass or World Cup because winning it is easier than placing say 4th in Primera Division. Still people care 10x more about &quot;silly&quot; Worlc Cup as they care way more about anachronic World Championship match.<p>New system might be fairer, better, w/e but just because it&#x27;s new you just lost many fans, interest and sponsors.",1383709706

6680334,comment,6668388,6671819,1,0,kansface,,,"I suppose it depends on what you want to accomplish.  Most of the extra baggage could be removed within a month.  Fixing other things would be much much harder.<p>For instance, Vim uses an internal byte queue to represent all input.  When Vim receives keystrokes, it translates them to known sequences, sometimes combining them with previous bytes, and shoves them back into the input stream- ie, instead of using structs/unions, Vimuses raw bytes.  The down side (besides the insanity of doing this in the first place) is that some sequences can never be represented unless you want a byte/multibyte sequence for every possible combination. Data is just lost.  On the upside, Vim potentially saves a few bytes.  No one would make that tradeoff in 2013.  See <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/2bp9UdfZ63M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/2bp9UdfZ63M</a> for the discussion about this.<p>Another problem for attack is that Vim uses a pile of regex hacks for syntax highlighting.  Presumably, the hacks make it go faster.  Of course, some things are context specific, so this gets really fucking ugly really quickly. Perhaps this wouldn&#x27;t be a huge problem, but Vim also lacks the ability to run any asynchronous plugins (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/-4pqDJfHCsM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/-4pqDJfHCsM</a>).  IE, you couldn&#x27;t do the highlighting outside of Vim and apply the rules in real time.  You can&#x27;t run a linter in the background and highlight errors.  The patch ostensibly fixes these problems, but in reality it will never be merged because of existing bugs in Vim (ie, the extension causes Vim to crash through no fault of its own).<p>The design philosophy of Vim is that it should be embedded (not an IDE).  This is fine, but Vim makes this hard  because it uses global variables for everything instead of internal interfaces among other reasons.  If Vim made this easy, you&#x27;d see Vim embedded into other text editors (instead of emulated or instead of using crazy pty hacks).<p>The most useful change I could see would be dropping Vim script entirely and replacing it with a single, well known scripting language.  This is somewhat in the works right now- Bram is currently in the process of better bridging the gap between python and Vim (currently, python is restricted to evaling vimscript/ex commands).<p>Ultimately, 100K could do a bit to cleanup Vim, but that probably isn&#x27;t helpful to end users.  If you peruse the vim mailing list, there are quite a few topics like this- people suggesting or implementing large changes- they all get dropped. Realistically, I just see Vim stagnating.",1383707138

I didn&#x27;t stay with the company until the very end, you&#x27;re right. I had a different vision than they did. I still was on the YC Founders list. I still went to every YC event, meeting, and dinner as a founder. Just trying to share what I know and learned from YC so people can still find success and community.<p>After I left the company I was taken off the founders list, that was fine by me. Does that make me any less a part of YC or the spirit of this community?",1383707001

6680319,comment,6680040,6680040,1,0,pkmehta,,,"I think the comments by Matt Kaufman (president of Crunchbase) about the damage that can be caused by &quot;Crunchbase replicas&quot; reflect the knowledge on AOL&#x27;s part that Crunchbase is a potentially very interesting data asset.  And so the reality is that they&#x27;ll prob revisit rights to Crunchbase, and it&#x27;ll go from very open to something less so (how far is the question).  I would also guess that Crunchbase has a paid subscription offering in the works.<p>I would also speculate that People+ may be the first &quot;offender&quot; Crunchbase will target.  Datafox.co, Mattermark, Inkwire.io might all find themselves in the crosshairs.<p>This also underscores a common mistake developers make which is creating on someone else&#x27;s platform where the rules can and will change significantly especially when monetization becomes important.  And it seems monetization is on Crunchbase&#x27;s mind.<p>Update:<p>This post on the Crunchbase blog articulates that monetization is coming and that the above &quot;offenders&quot; may be hearing from AOL counsel soon.<p><a href=""http://info.crunchbase.com/2013/11/05/crunchbase-people-and-the-eff/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.crunchbase.com/2013/11/05/crunchbase-people-and-...</a><p>&quot;CrunchBase must remain open to anyone who wants to contribute, and retrieving that data for non-commercial benefit must remain open as well.

How is this different than creating an account in the app? Can I not create an account in the app?<p>2) The floating &quot;Learn More...&quot; is unnecessary. People know how to scroll.<p>3) The alternating layout communicates that they&#x27;re separate features rather than steps in a process. I would explore different ways to communicate the steps.<p>4) Make it very clear the problem your app is solving. Like petalpete mentioned in his suggestion, &quot;event&quot; is vague and generic. Try to use terms that clear and specific like concert, holiday party, etc.<p>5) Maybe consider curating the recent images. Some of them are fairly low quality.",1383706966

74094,comment,73850,74015,0,0,ajkates,,,"Ahh, now I see.  Yes, that's very clear. Cool.<p>I think that this would be very useful.  My biggest complaint would involve having to sign up and create my own lists in order to see lists that best match my own.  That takes a lot of time and energy.<p>Perhaps utilizing lists people have created elsewhere on the internet, just to supplement things?  I mean, I have all that stuff already in facebook.  Perhaps you could use that information, and allow me to find other people/movies/books/magazines without having the feel like i'm putting time and effort to join a new community.<p>That's the only thing that would stop me from signing up and  doing it all right now.  (I'm playing devil's advocate just a bit, sorry for the harshness).",1193720213

STFU already, it's going to be coming.  Soon.<p>PS. Isn't this Sun's responsibility anyways?",1193720004

It really got me thinking in new ways.  There's a reason why von Ahn won a MacArthur (""Genius"") Grant for his Human Computation work.",1193719945

74088,comment,74067,74084,0,0,aristus,,,"""I don't think that the details of which particular Turing machine is or is not universal are all that significant. What is significant, though, is how widespread universality is in general.  And currently the only way we have of establishing that is to do the hard work of proving the universality or non-universality of particular Turing machines.""<p>I smell a rat. His ""Universality"" and how often it occurs is what he has yet to prove.",1193718323
74087,comment,73840,74035,0,0,ajkates,,,"Perhaps.  You and I don't care, not yet.  I use just about every mainstream Google product/service available.  But, we're not most people.  Most people are already weary about what they do with their personal information.<p>There will be a time in the not too distant future when this barrier will be crossed.  Giving any large, corporate entity too much information is often perceived as dangerous, because they have a greater ability to utilize/mine/profit from that information than a new startup.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see...",1193718256
74086,comment,73906,74045,0,0,tokipin,,,"i think that's the problem: having idea people working on details.  by definition they're not good at them -- it's like forcing a shape into the wrong hole.  their powers are best used in creative positions<p>but those sorts of positions aren't very standard or given to people just starting out, so it can be hard for them if they start out doing detail work and their difficulty with it gets the better of them and they're perceived as incompetent.  even if they manage to stay afloat in the monotony, their strengths are likely to remain invisible in the detail and the higher-ups never see their potential.  worst-case scenario of course, but i doubt it's rare<p>i heard this second-hand, but supposedly IBM has a particular genius somewhere in california. he is very sloppy, is probably a night owl... but when he gets a spark of an idea, whether it be in the middle of the night, a 'task force' is summoned to jot down as much detail about the idea as possible.  if that's true then IBM knows the specialty and significance of these sorts of people<p>looking at it from another perspective, Einstein is probably the most extreme example of an idea person.  but despite being terribly lazy, he was able to do many great things because he _didn't consider it work_.  an idea person with a passion is something of an unstoppable force<p>funnily, the lazyness is likely due to the overhead of the mind organizing data into a format which allows specialized (sensory/intuitive,) instant retrieval later on.  the overhead is significant, but the gift is powerful.  it's present in varying forms and degrees in different people and in extreme cases (like these 'brilliant' guys) is risky like min-maxing<p>i've found that jungian psychological theories such as MBTI <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator</a> provide a good lexicon with which to think about these sorts of things",1193718252
74085,comment,73674,73904,0,0,randomhack,,,"Sorry .. that was just a random thought in my brain .. heres the reasoning in reverse .. assuming the company is worth $50m after an year with a probability of 33% and worth zilch with probability of 67%, and assuming that u have a 2% stake .. expected payout = 0.33 x 50 x 0.02 = 330k.<p>the estimate was  optimistic in my opinion. so i wud say a 2% stake is not worth it. its probably better to spend 1 year building ur own company i.e. one in which u have a significantly higher share.<p>but of course it still doesnt answer the question i guess",1193717330

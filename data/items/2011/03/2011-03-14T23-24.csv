I've seen my share of bullying online and done some of my own that I deeply regret.<p>During my first year on the internet as in interactive participant I was exclusively surrounded by furries[1]. After that I ended up programming bots[2] for deviantArt's chat network. That ended after being I was banned for discovering and exploiting security holes. (my bad, I haven't done that since)<p>Since, I moved on to help moderate an art website[3]. That didn't work out because there wasn't well defined rules for moderators. I still have great respect for the current admins. I left moderating on good terms.  Then I moved on to hanging out on irc with system administrators, iOS developers (I'm a rails guy), a ruby on rails community, and a chatroom of former usenet users that are at least 40 years older than I am and are published authors. I'm working on building my own art website[4] so who knows who I'll end up being around next.<p>After being banned from deviantArt, I've made it a point to not tolerate douche-baggery in any form in myself or others. Most of the communities I hang out with now encourage respect. If you want to change, there are hard decisions to make. I was lucky and a deviantArt administrator made the decision for me.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://botdom.com/wiki/Dante"" rel=""nofollow"">http://botdom.com/wiki/Dante</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://epochwolf.storm-artists.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epochwolf.storm-artists.net/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://epochwolf.com/tag/singleforestcom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epochwolf.com/tag/singleforestcom</a>",1300145488

Some analysts act like it's obvious that they do, but I find no mention of it in the NRC docs. Mainly it's counted as a feature of more advanced designs.<p>* What does it mean for the suppression pool to be damaged? Was that optional equipment? It's being described as the ""last line of defense"" by a smart-looking fellow from Tokyo U.<p>* Can the control rods fall out? They don't drop in from above, they're pushed up from the bottom hydraulically.<p>* Do the materials of the fuel and the control rods melt at different rates? It seems like this could result in the materials separating as they melt and a partial core re-igniting as a lump at the bottom of the vessel. Or was this possibility considered and designed against in this '60s-era reactor?<p>* What is the real implication of the plutonium in the MOX fuel in Fukushima Daiichi reactor No.2?

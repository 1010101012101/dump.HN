2763029,comment,2757980,2762845,3,0,shou4577,,,"Immediately afterward, though, the parent <i>does</i> step in and help out - a small amount. It sounds to me like the parent here is trying to subtly remind the employee that this is a learning experience for Guy. The entire exchange seems, in my mind, to take no more than 30 seconds away from the busy customer service representative, which is about 20 more seconds than it would have taken for the parent to ask in the first place.<p>There are, of course, some things wrong here. The child should not interrupt another customer to get help - that is rude. But part of learning is making mistakes, and I think it totally agrees with the spirit of the rest of the story to let the child make the mistake, and point out afterwards what improvements could be made (to be clear, the story does not say that this happens, I am only suggesting the hypothetical that it <i>could</i> happen, and I claim that it would justify the inconvenience). Again, this is slightly inconvenient for the people involved, but a great life lesson for the kid. By making these social mistakes, he gains experience with the types of subtle cues people let on when you are performing a social faux pas. A short explanation after the fact from the father can help the child not to make the same mistakes again.<p>Of course, this particular father may have done none of those things. He may be a sadistic bastard who pointed out the most busy, overly worked employee in the store simply because he likes bothering people, then congratulated his kid on making a spectacle. But the spirit of the story is lighthearted, so I interpret his actions as well-meaning (and probably slightly exaggerated, for effect).<p>I don't think that people should have to put up with any obnoxious thing a kid does. In fact, I think it would have been a great thing for the other people in the story to treat him like an adult, just like the dad wanted them to. If the clerk had said ""hang on, I'll be able to help you in one minute"", that wouldn't have been a problem. Or if the other customer had said, ""pardon me, but I am in the middle of a question here - can you wait?"", then the obnoxiousness of the situation could have been avoided entirely <i>and</i> the kid would have gotten a great lesson out of it.<p>People just need to relax. I know kids can be obnoxious. It bothers me to hell when I see children running around, bumping into people and sword-fighting in the aisles of the supermarket while the parent seems totally oblivious. But these sort of minor inconveniences need to be viewed as they are - minor. Total time wasted of other people in the store on this day - maybe about 45 seconds. Hardly a big enough deal for you to label the daddy a ""self-entitled asshole"".<p>By the way, I didn't down-vote you. I don't agree with you, but I think that you made a perfectly valid point - children are annoying. In fact, I up-voted you for it.",1310651932

And in return it provides pretty substantial benefits (eliminates many memory-related errors and nonproductive housekeeping tasks).<p>2. RAM being available in humongous amounts for very little money. Eating RAM for breakfast simply isn't a buisness-significant downside of a language/vm these days.<p>BTW, the Oracle JVM (and probably others as well) garbage collector can be tuned quite a bit to make it less memory-hungry at the expense of performance.

In to succeed, Google needs to maintain laser-like focus of usability and continue to innovate on a small number of features -- it can't just glom random stuff onto it or integrate random GoogleLabs projects.<p>For those whom Google Docs is a suitable replacement for Sharepoint, I doubt integrating G+ will make a huge difference. For those for whom Google Docs is inadequate, G+ won't tip the balance. If G+ takes the proposed approach it will actually alienate many potential users. It's better to embrace the outside world than replace it. (And, in fact, it contradicts the ""blue ocean"" strategy.)<p>Frankly, from a big picture strategic viewpoint, it's great to see Google annihilating Facebook, but it's fiddling while China burns. It's losing search, and no-one in China aspires to own an Android phone -- they're saving up to buy iPhones and using non-Google Android phones while they wait.",1310651858

Any investor, whether it's an angel, VC firm, hedge fund, etc., is going to very likely use a scattergun approach.  That's just how the numbers must work when you're looking at high risk investments.  An exception means that someone got lucky.<p>- Take a mom and pop business.  Suppose it needs capital.  The typical approach is to get a bank loan.  This is similar to selling shares to a VC but with different terms and a different distribution of risk.  Just because something like a farm lends itself to loans and something like a video game for the iPhone lends itself to VC funding doesn't mean that the two businesses are fundamentally different, just that the cash flow and risk result in a slightly different form of cooperation between the individual(s) and the financial firm.<p>- ""Traditional venture capitalism"" was simply a more risk-averse type of financial firm.  They let angels take the big risks and reap the big rewards and settled for bets that looked more like a sure thing (but still riskier than would have made it suitable for other forms of funding).<p>- I don't think you have made the case that any of this incentivizes flipping, or that flipping is ""bad"".  I'd argue that to the extent that firms exist b/c they can be flipped, that is innovation that would not have happened if the financial structures didn't exist to match investment dollars with innovation and entrepreneurship -- startups get acquired because an acquisition offers better value and/or lower risk to the acquiring firm than trying to develop the equivalent thing in-house.  If you're stretching this into an analogy about elaborate financial instruments, I think it's quite a stretch.<p>I think that what you're actually seeing is a bit of a credit bubble around startups that resulted from the destruction of many of the risky (but well known) wealth creation instruments that Wall Street had been using.  Of course, more investment means another ""layer"" of startups will exist with another ""layer"" of risk characteristics.  Yes this is similar to wall street, but it's a consequence of the basic laws of economics and nothing else.",1310651244

The overall feel is just... more polished than Unity, and even more polished than GNOME 2.x. I like being able to bring up the overlay with a keystroke, then start typing the name of the app I want to launch, or browse the virtual desktop list, or pick an app from the dock. The Alt-Tab switcher has a big icon for every app I have open (like OS X), but if the app has multiple windows, they appear in a kind of submenu and I can navigate with the arrow keys to the one I want. I even love the notification system - when an app on another desktop wants the focus, an unobtrusive pop-up appears at the bottom of the screen; if I miss it, I can clink my mouse-cursor to the bottom right to see all the notifications awaiting me.<p>It took me a while to make it recognise my preferred keybindings, and I've had to resort to poking through gconf-editor and dconf-editor to make it respect my personal preferences, but overall I really like it, and I'm looking forward to seeing where GNOME 3 goes from here.",1310650617

Then I started making websites on top of a CMS (I used CMSMadeSimple but anything will do really). It could do everything I wanted and really quickly, and at some point if there was something that I couldn't do in the CMS or there was a bug, I could easily dig in the source code and fix it myself. Just like a car, you can pop the hood and play around with the stuff inside, but since it's already built and working you shouldn't have to play inside it too much.",1310650207

That said, I love the service and wanted to take it mobile, so I upgraded to premium, so I'm no longer hearing ads.<p>2.I didn't experience disappearing playlists. I'm sure this happened to you, just pointing out that it's not a super common occurrence b/c I'm on Spotify hours per day with plenty of playlists and haven't seen the issue.<p>3. Agreed. I miss my Beatles and Pink Floyd. However, the Stones' library is on there.<p>4. Again, I'm sure you're seeing this issue, but I use both Skype and Spotify on my PC fairly often and haven't had any issues.<p>5. In fairness, I'm just interested in a streaming music platform - not starting a movement. There are plenty of inefficiencies in the record label industry, but I'm. Just a startup guy, not an artist so it's not my fight ;-)<p>One issue I will add is that Spotify stopped streaming on my Droid about two weeks into my premium subscription.

I love doing it, but lately, something's been bothering me. Up to this point, the entirety of my server-side programming has been done in PHP. I learned web development with basic PHP and MySQL, and now work as an entrepreneur in my own company, using that combination.<p>However, lately, I've been bored with PHP. Each time I make a website, I feel like I'm reinventing the wheel when I write new code for things like user authentification or account systems. I keep looking at Ruby on Rails tutorials, and salivating at the beautiful syntax and elegant, DRY expressions. I love the <i>idea</i> of using Rails, as a modern MVC framework that lets me get things done quicker and doesn't require me to re-invent the wheel.<p>The problem is, every time I start using frameworks like Rails, and create my first ""Hello World"" application, I am dissatisfied. It works- I can list, create, edit, and delete objects that I've specified in the code. However, it just doesn't feel right, because <i>I don't understand how the framework is doing it's thing</i>. What is being compiled into what when I run the app on the server? When Rails ""magic"" happens, what is really going on? If there's an error, how on earth will I know how to fix it?<p>-I feel like since I didn't code the framework from scratch, I can't use it because I don't truly understand how it works.-<p>Is this a justified sentiment, or am I just too used to working with PHP? Does anybody else feel this way?<p>Thanks for any answers you can give me, I really appreciate it.",1310649894

2762886,comment,2760989,2761794,1,0,brudgers,,,"><i>""Why are creative Lego sets a minority?""</i><p>They aren't. Lego kits are packaged to appeal to on the basis of an objective model building experience and with the subtext of collectability. These days Lego uses cross branding to leverage this packaging in order to appeal more directly to emotions which spark the impulse to buy.<p>But subjectively, everyone understands that the bulldozer kit is just a big box of parts - and part of the appeal of those well defined projects is the anticipation of the ways in which the unusual pieces the kit contains can be used to make other stuff.<p>The typical sequence of a ""non-creative"" Lego set starts with an adult seeing it in the store and thinking it is pretty cool and reasonably priced. My son got a LEGO City Passenger Plane 7893 a few years ago well after they were out of production, when his grand parents picked it up for $25 at Costco as a Christmas present - they actually purchased three; one for each of the grandsons.<p>[<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lego-City-Passenger-Plane-7893/dp/B000BVKSAK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Lego-City-Passenger-Plane-7893/dp/B000...</a>]<p>Yes, Grandpa thought it was cool.<p>Next, the kid builds it per the directions with or without adult participation depending on age, complexity, and mutual interest. Then they display it.<p>At this point, everyone understands that it can be disassembled and repurposed. This creates a tension between the adult impulse toward collecting (to which the packaging was intended to appeal) and the joy of destruction - strongly encouraged by the fact that Lego models are designed for destruction -unlike a plastic or balsa model.<p>So the airplane sits at the suggestion of the adult (either a real adult or the child's own adult impulse), while the kid watches for the adult to lose interest and imagines all the amazing ways those four jet engines can be combined with the pieces from the long disassembled Ferrari F1 and various Starwars spacecraft.<p>And then one day it happens. There is a car with three jet engines on top; a space craft reminiscent of the <i>Galileo</i> shuttle craft; and a flying wing with an open cockpit in the center and sails from the pirate ship where turbines once sat..plus many more pieces added to the proverbial giant box of Legos.<p>The only real hint of the original out of the box design which remains is the instructions - which will only be saved at the insistence of the adult - and even then, they are likely to to wind up on the curb due to the friction of their irrelevance.<p>In other words, there are no uncreative Lego sets - and I have never seen a kid who would willingly be uncreative with the parts. And I've never seen an adult who was successful at enforcing the plastic model mentality over a prolonged period of time...which are very good things indeed.",1310649848

2762846,comment,2762634,2762634,24,0,sambeau,,,"I've been using Spotify since the UK closed beta (a few years ago, now). At first it seemed like the most amazing thing ever, but slowly I fell out of love with it, and now I barely use it.<p>Why?<p>1) The ads. At first they were reasonably infrequent and unobtrusive. But gradually they became more frequent and more and more obtrusive. Eventually some companies were deliberately producing jarring ads to grab your attention.<p>Many of the ads were for music. Other music: music that I would never listen to and (more importantly) music that was totally incongruous and jarring to the music it was interrupting.<p>2) Disappearing Music. I created loads of playlists filled with interesting (often independent) new music. Gradually whole playlists disappeared and stopped working. It felt like <i>my</i> music was being stolen. To replace ownership with streaming (at least for the generation that owned CDs) the catalogue needs stability.<p>3) Missing Music. As usual it's the big, classic stuff. I bought a license for a christmas party at my parents house. The lack of Beatles, Stones, Queen etc caused a near riot. Spotify was booed off.<p>4) Skype. I don't know why (but I suspect its probably Adobe's fault ;-)) but Skype and Spotify on the PC seem to have a problem with each other. Maybe I'm seeing ghosts here but I frequently have problems with these two apps (and the Chrome Flash plugin). Eventually I had to stop using one or other.<p>5) The artist payments are miniscule-to-the-point-of-broken. See this:<p><pre><code>  http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/how-much-do-music-artists-earn-online/\n</code></pre>\nI realise that the first problem would have been easily fixed by buying Spotify Premium and I was going to do this until my favourite music started to disappear.<p>Hopefully, the US launch will be enough to persuade the small labels to return to Spotify (maybe they already have?) and with a larger advertising base better ads could be produced and more appropriate targeting of ads could make the advert-laden experience more palatable. Similarly, a US launch may convince the big rock dinosaurs to join. That, at least, would improve next xmas.<p>Don't get me wrong: Spotify is an amazing thing and has a ton of potential. The US (especially teen US and low-income US) is going to love it. The App is fantastic (kind'a magical when you first see how quickly and easily it plays music).<p>If you have mainstream, modern taste and can stomach the loud ads you'll get great service for free.<p>If you're a fussy indie-kid like me who mostly listens to whispering soft audio as you work, you may want to check how many of your favourite obscure artists are onboard before you buy premium.<p>As for artists - while Spotify is a great innovation and a valuable way to move young people from illegally torrenting to legally streaming music it needs to generate more money for the musicians for it to be truly sustainable.<p>Edit: To make clear this is a UK account (not a US beta) so the falling-out-of-love took a few years.",1310649276

Ergo, it's like the ""box"" was never even opened.<p>Now that I've answered that, let's caution you about your deployment of Mr. Cat. First of all, I don't believe you'll need an uncertain quantum object to observe in this particular thought experiment. Life is complicated enough without bringing in more quantum mechanics than you need. Just imagine a brick. It's red. Light is shining on the brick and it looks red. Now, I install my time-bending lenses around the brick, and then at one particular instant the brick changes to be yellow, and then goes back to being red. But you don't see that, you just see a continuously red brick, <i>even though the light was ""shining on"" the brick the whole time</i>, because our lenses made a ""time hole"" in the stream of light and the color change happened during the hole.<p>I should also warn you that our friend Mr. Cat is a bad metaphor in many ways. (He was originally an in-joke, after all, used by people who were debating the apparent absurdity of a new theory.) The problem with the cat is that he's a completely unrealistic creature, and he primes your intuition in all sorts of incorrect ways. In real life you will never stumble across a coherent superposition of two quantum states as dramatically large (trillions of cells!) and dramatically different (alive vs dead!) as this imaginary cat. Real cats interact with their surroundings. A lot. They breathe and meow, they emit organic molecules that smell like cat, they charge up with static electricity (electric fields) and then run around in circles (magnetic fields), and above all they gravitate (which is difficult to cloak). So to make the thought experiment work the cat's imaginary box has to <i>be</i> a cloaking device, a box that permits no interaction with the outside world until it is ""opened"". And that doesn't exist in real life.<p>And, therefore, importing the cat into <i>this</i> thought experiment is a <i>particularly</i> bad move, because it's redundant. If you have Shroedinger's imaginary box you don't need an additional set of imaginary time-cloaking lenses. The box is already cloaking the cat, for a fairly long period of time.<p>Always be careful: Thinking about completely impossible things is fun for a while, but don't make a habit of it, or you'll become the sort of insufferable spaced-out quantum-mechanics groupie who says things like <i>gosh, maybe when I turn around and stop believing in this tree it will cease to exist</i>.

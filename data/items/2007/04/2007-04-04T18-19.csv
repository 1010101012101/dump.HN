8857,comment,8848,8848,0,0,e1ven,,,"Neither should be primary.<p>Honestly- The best thing that you can do is to figure out how they're going to get along with you, and how well they can find solutions to problems.<p>They say that the first few employees really determine the culture of a startup, and you want people who can adjust to whatever job is necessary, and solve problems quickly and move on to the next thing in the ever-growing list.<p>I read an article online (Was it Joel? Seth? Not sure), who argued that there are really two types of programmers- Problem Solvers, and Cogs.<p>Cogs are the people who can tell you every line of code in a TCP/IP stack, or squeeze amazing performance by reprogramming your server-code in assembler. They're the people you bring in to solve problem foo-<p>""We need a guy who kicks butt in SQL to optimize this thing"" Let's find one.""<p>That's great, and that's amazingly useful.. But not for the first few people for a startup.. For a startup, I'd worry more about coming up with solutions to problems that we have.
Someone who can pick up Lisp or Ruby or (insert language of the week) in a few days more useful in those crucial early weeks than someone who can eek every bit of performance.<p>Focus on the hard stuff first, like building something people actually want to use. THEN, hire people to help specific elements. <p>With any luck, by that point you'll have created a corporate culture that encourages flexibility, and they'll come around ;)<p>-Colin",1175712714

8855,comment,8753,8753,0,0,Wintermute,,,"2 other things:<p>1.  I tend to be listening to music when I am browsing the web, so it was kind of disruptive to have the playlists of others automatically load when I was looking at them.  Might be better if they were stopped initially and I could choose ones I might want to hear.<p>2.  Id probably like to do / see a little more before I registered.  I don't like to just register for any site I stumble upon.  I like to get a sense of what I am getting into first.  The more I can do, the more likely I will register.  <p>Hope this helps.<p>",1175712417

Or, rather, originally the YC concept was geared towards this audience, and the funding amount is an artifact of that. <p>",1175711701

Most of the idle plants are coal, with a small number of natural gas (higher construction cost per kw of capacity, previously more expensive fuel, but now natural gas is cheaper than the mitigated costs of coal, so they run gas and idle coal).<p>So, you&#x27;d be adding coal to the operating mix.  The dirtiest plants are the ones which were idled, too.<p>In the 5 year timeframe, you could argue for building more natural gas, solar, wind, etc. to replace the nuclear, but as far as I can tell, wind and solar and being done as fast as they can, and the coal to gas transition is also happening.<p>There also isn&#x27;t &quot;one grid&quot;; it&#x27;s basically 3, and it&#x27;s not like it has infinite capacity everywhere.

Canadian CANDU plants use natural uranium and the way they&#x27;re constructed is far safer than other types of reactors. Two extremes of fuel used and plant design yet it seems some people see no difference.

5846243,comment,5845000,5845000,1,0,drostie,,,"In my usage of Tor it seemed like the router would choose a small subset of the network to be my set of entrance nodes[1] and the exit nodes chosen were also a small subset of the network[2]. Just clicking &quot;new identity&quot; on Vidalia would often fail to change one or the other, even though the middle node changed.<p>Combined with the 3-hop limit[3], this suggests that a network like Amunet or blutmagie, with a strong exit node presence, might be able to fully de-anonymize a tiny fraction of the traffic passing over Tor. This is interesting because Tor is trying to guard against mostly de-anonymizing arbitrary traffic, not fully de-anonymizing special traffic.<p>So if Amunet wants to de-anonymize a request, what does it do? The way this works is, Amunet runs a patched version of the Tor software; they buy a couple of servers in remote data centers which they do not notify the network as belonging to the Amunet. Those servers work as entrance nodes, not exit nodes. We&#x27;ll call this entrance node the Malicious Gateway.<p>Given a forwarded chunk of data, the malicious gateway can  tell that it&#x27;s not forwarding that data to a known exit node, which means it&#x27;s the first of the three hops -- not the second. This means that the malicious gateway can pretty-reliably infer that the IP which contacted it was not a dumb router, but was the instigator of the packet -- even if that router was part of Tor.<p>Amunet sets up their service as follows: before the MG sends on the request to some out-of-control middle man M, it sends to the Amunet exit nodes a simple block saying &quot;expect a request of about this length routed from M; I am tracing it back to IP ____.&quot; If you accidentally chose to use an Amunet exit router, then the middle node&#x27;s distinctiveness has actually helped Amunet to filter the signal from the noise, so the proof gets <i>stronger</i> as the network grows (though the amount of compromised traffic diminishes). That boost is provided by the three-hops limit which also removes plausible deniability. And finally, since people choose a small block of entrance nodes, you can in principle get a <i>lot</i> of transaction data from just one person.<p>[1] This is intentional: you choose a small pool of entrance nodes because Tor wants to hide the fact that you&#x27;re using Tor from your ISP. Tor looks like HTTPS traffic to your ISP, but people don&#x27;t open lots of HTTPS traffic to lots of different sites in short periods of time.\n[2] There seem to be a few reasons for the limited exit node selection. First, it seems that Tor preferentially chooses high-bandwidth exit nodes. Second, exit nodes are not enabled-by-default, because people are scared about legal implications.\n[3] Three hops is hard-coded into the system. Changing to four hops would make the proposed attack reveal much, much less -- but it would also slow down the network by 33%. The issue has been raised before but the consensus appears to be that wanting four nodes makes you paranoid.",1370723894

If an employee provides value X and receives wages X-10, the amount of exploitation is 10.<p>And this is, by definition, the competitive wage in neoclassical theory.  Suppose there is a group of employers, and a group of employees, and each employee adds value X to any of the employers.  Then any employer will want to hire all the workers for themselves, if the prevailing wage is X - 10.  So competition ensures that there is no exploitation in that sense.<p>So while neoclassical theory does allow for &quot;exploitation&quot;, it also predicts that it is very unlikely to actually occur.<p>You seem to be reinterpreting neoclassical theory where &quot;marginal value&quot; is decided according to your accounting rules, rather than the competitive market.",1370723882

If Facebook is based in the US, China and Iran will eventually break into it and compromise national security. If Facebook was based in Germany, China and Iran (and the NSA) would eventually break into it and compromise national security. It doesn&#x27;t really change anything.<p>However, if Facebook was a distributed system, such that no one could compromise it in its entirety at a central location, it would help keep the bad guys out. Which in this context is more important, because we have a lot more spies, undercover law enforcement officers, military and commercial secrets etc. that we need to protect than we have terrorists we can&#x27;t catch through other means. Which, for exactly that reason, is the way things would go if they move away from centralized US servers in response to spying fears. There is a reason the Navy sponsored Tor.",1370723589

The argument was essentially that if you disclose the identity of a suspect before they have their day in court, you might encourage other victims to come forward with evidence that will build the case, which is presumably favourable if the suspect actually is guilty but obviously has severe potential consequences if in fact they are innocent but publicly associated with sex crimes anyway.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the parallel with whistleblowing should be in a case of allegation but not yet a conclusive decision in court, but I&#x27;m pretty sure governments shouldn&#x27;t be entitled to <i>more</i> protection against potential damage to their reputation than an alleged but not convicted sex offender.<p>(Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not commenting on the appropriateness of the policy toward disclosure of suspected sex offenders, just the double standard that would arise if the UK government objected to this kind of whistleblowing using your &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; argument.)",1370722073

At the same time our military was &quot;bringing freedom to the Iraqi peoples&quot;, our legislature and executive conspired to remove or automate much judicial review of spying. In effect American citizens lost another type of liberty.<p>We seem to be better at protecting our access to riffles.\nMost of the liberties created by America&#x27;s founding fathers (women were not allowed to vote) were designed to thwart the power of a monarchy and the power of the Roman-Catholic church.  Many of these founding fathers were members of a fraternity called the Free Masons and read authors like John Locke.  My point is they were a fairly homogeneous group of Englishmen.<p>Since then America has expanded civil rights explicit in the Constitution to include people of all races and genders.\nBut the Industrial age has been a constant force of erosion of our liberties.  Our elections are not publicly funded.  This means there is a huge advantage to material wealth and the wealthy have steered Congress to benefit themselves.<p>The bright shinning star of hope for The Land of The Free is our government is not systemically corrupt, at least not in the traditional meaning of corrupt.<p>I think this is a good discussion by Prof Lessig, &quot;Republic Lost&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxCo2bE9Gtk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxCo2bE9Gtk</a>",1370721827

I had a job that paid very well in the US and there's a very good chance I would have made much more doing that than starting my own company.<p>The US is often years ahead in design, advertising, the latest tech trends, etc. American brands are more likely to try new things out/it's easier to reach larger scale adoption more easily. Through out my life I have always waited for American products/chains/innovations (no matter how novel -- Easy Mac, Yogurt Tubes, MTV, Old Navy) to make it up to Canada. In my opinion those are definitely reasons to move to the US.<p>So much of starting/running your own thing is dealing with mental blocks.

I.E. how well can he do on a standardized test, how good are his grades, etc.<p>This leads to people taking the easy way out and just memorizing everything without understanding or thinking critically about what they are doing. These people aren't thinking for themselves and instead are just taking everything told to them as fact and regurgitating it when they are asked. This obviously leads to a problem when they become adults and need to make decisions on who is to lead them. Instead of coming to their own conclusion they will listen to their parents, preacher, neighbor, etc. All of whom might have come to their conclusion of who is the best leader faultily.<p>In Addition: Just to give you guys an example of where this is being most blatantly done, literature classes. I remember in my lit classes that almost 90% of the class did not read the book. Instead they just took the spark notes and memorized key points taking nothing out of the text.

No one can predict the future, but I can't see any nation ever being as globally relevant as the U.S. was in 1945-95. That wasn't just the peak of U.S. power but also the peak of <i>nation-state</i> power. If I'm right, no national government will ever attain it again. Not the European Union (technically a multinational government), not China, and definitely not India. I think China will be doing very well economically in 2100 (and people will be surprised to learn about the extremely widespread 20th- and early-21st-century Chinese poverty) but I think the influence of national governments will have waned by then.<p>I'm actually pretty bullish about the long-term American future, because I think the global trend is not only positive but going to accelerate in the next 20 years. I think the Bush years were a nadir, and I think we're in a long U-shaped valley, but I think the 2020s will be slightly better than the 2010s, which will shape up to be better than the 2000s were. ""Decline"" for us is going to look like it did for the British: the average Briton is still a hell of a lot better off (happier, wealthier, and healthier) in 2012 than in 1900. People don't actually think about national dominance much when they don't have it, and by 2050, I think that concept itself will be pretty well outmoded.<p>To put it frankly, I don't care if the U.S. is geopolitically #1 or #14 in 2050, but I hope they've done something about cancer.",1347810358

4529338,comment,4524447,4524447,1,0,tete,,,"I kinda agree. I am 23, but even though age is a proxy for experience one shouldn't overvalue experience in first place. In face experience can be a huge hindrance. Experience can (but doesn't necessarily) lead to be less open, to be less creative and also can cause you to lose the ability to see things open and from different perspectives.<p>People (I) start to rely on their experience and while this can allow you to do things more effectively, because you have them in your working memory, etc.<p>However, when I look back to the things I used to do when I was eleven, I felt like there were no border. I was able to understand concepts instantly, just read things and I knew it.<p>Sometimes I think a wunderkind is just someone whose hobbies are related to school wisdom. When I look back to every teacher was constantly calling me professor just because I read the stuff in the math books, read other books, liked to watch the educational program (which I our class watched again in high school) one can just think so.<p>On the flip side I didn't learn a lot of the things with other hobbies did. Sometimes a wunderkind is someone with lots of hobbies and having basics skills everywhere seems like a good countermeasure to relying on experience you made in a certain field.<p>Well, my life wasn't that good though. I was that kind of geek that got beaten up by others for good marks and so stopped going to school for a long time (but decided to still get my finals at a later, just learning on my own doing the necessary tests). Still, when I look back to that time when everyone called me professor things changed. I think I made a lot of different experiences because of it though. These days I don't give the impression of a creepy geek anymore, because my social skills were forced to develop quite nicely.<p>Basically why I want to write this is because I know there are a lot of people who are outsiders and stay like that all their life. I know how it is when they say you have a high IQ and you try to be super nice, because you may find it nice to be a geek around some people, but feel strange around others. But hey being a geek means being smart, so one can just spend a nice time doing something social, looking what others do, how they react and also self reflect on your self. Even if non-geeks might behave differently, they are also just people like you. I think most geeks tend do focus on themselves and when they are shy they try their best to look good and then (correctly) come to the conclusion one shouldn't try to be different and just accept oneself. However what they sometimes forget is that one usually can learn most by just listening. Completely focus on someone else. One doesn't need to fear looking like a creep, if you just listen and people are even going to like you for it!<p>About the rest of this article: I don't know, but it looks like something that is going to bore one in the long run. Yeah startups are exciting and I am working for one too. It's great fun to actually do thing, but first off I don't really need a job to do something great and really wouldn't consider creating a successful company the greatest thing ever. It was done over and over and all you get is money, which seems like something rather boring if you are not a poor person or just addicted to it, which also won't make you happy.<p>So question: Do you really consider creating something like tumblr a great goal? I mean, if you take away all the hype then it's just a blog and the ability to like other blog posts. I wouldn't really call that something great, amazing and influential (not in the way I think most people want to be influential I guess). It's no revolutionary great thing and isn't more likely to save lives than to destroy them.<p>Of course I'd be happy and proud of myself, if I created tumblr, twitter or Facebook and see how it is successful, but at least I wouldn't feel like I had done something great with my life. If you do that's great, go for it!<p>Speaking about tumblr, I'd feel like a lot these ""average"" (that sounds really bad, sorry) people did more with writing a simple blog post and while I would find it super awesome that they did it with my software it just feels wrong to act like I'd really have contributed a lot by creating tumblr. There were easy to use blogs before that and hey, who says things actually didn't make it harder or something even better could have happened.<p>So before you go on, I urge you to think about what exactly makes you great about what you plan, else you risk to feel like you have wasted your time.

Not for malicious reasons; politicians don't need to be malicious in order to make bad decisions, they have plenty of other reasons for that. In many parts of the US, surface road speed limits are quite reasonable, but freeway speed limits are ridiculously low.<p>You are correct, by the way, as far as I know, that the 55mph speed limit was <i>originally</i> an energy conservation thing. This was during the oil crisis of the 70s, when it was federally imposed. Ever since the federal mandate was lifted, speed limits have been creeping back up, but at very different rates in different states.<p>To give a comparison, in France freeway speed limits are roughly 80mph in dry weather and 70mph in rain (I say roughly because they are, of course, in metric.) In Belgium, and the Netherlands it's 75mph, although The Netherlands has introduced many variable speed limits (electronic signs based on congestion) and recently bumped it up to 80mph on certain rural stretches (rural by <i>Dutch</i> standards). Germany, of course, has no speed limits at all on many long-distance Autobahns (about 50% of the network), although in metropolitan areas, contrary to popular mythology in the US, they often do have speed limits, which go by the charmingly long-winded name of ""Geschwindigkeitsbeschrnkung,"" often shortened in colloquial speech to ""Tempolimit."" The de facto speed limit on the unrestricted Autobahns is 125mph, since that's the fastest unmodified German cars will go.<p>So did some technocratic bunch of engineers evaluate the conditions in each of these countries and decide that somehow some subtle difference of geography that Germans are capable of safely driving a full 65 mph faster than Hawaiians?<p>I doubt it.<p>May I also remind the reader that <i>East</i> Germany used to have a rigorously enforced 60mph limit that was rather promptly lifted after the reunification, which was by no means an event of particular relevance to traffic engineering.",1347810054

It's one of the reasons why I wish philosophy and debate were mandatory courses in most schools. I don't believe making kids memorize multiplication tables when they are in kindergarten is going to help them, especially when they are barely able to comprehend them since they are so cognitively underdeveloped.<p>In addition: From what I am noticing, the kids that go to college to study degrees that involve dealing with unsolvable or unsolved problems are the kids that understand and not just memorize what they are taught. The education system downplays understanding and focuses on memorization. This obviously comes from America's result based culture. This leads to a population of people that can't think for themselves and only  do what they are told.

So like, the SQL that generated the view could be used in reverse, so when you run an update on the view, it would know which fields to update in the original pure data.<p>If someone got all of that working, then I really question why database organization matters.  I know it's important for seeing relationships and all that, but in reality, data just exists.  The relationships are a level above that.  I really think that someone could make a database that works more like a zip file, where it wouldn't matter how you laid it out, for the most part it would just look like a spreadsheet and each entity would just have all of the data in one row.  This is how ""regular"" folks view things.<p>Also this is a bit off topic, but automatic normalization has a lot in common with the semantic web.

We <i>don't have universal healthcare</i> because of this fucking attitude. If you have ignorant people, you end up with an ignorant, fucked-up culture.

It's when I make plans, collect my thoughts about what happened throughout the day, think about what I have do to tomorrow, the list is endless.<p>I think that two of the issues is that thinking is fun, and I find that 'not thinking about anything analytical' is incredibly boring for me, to the point where I can get aggravated. So after a while of thinking about my breathing, and random boring, non-thought provoking crap I give up and BAM all the intense thoughts that I was desperate to thing about come back.<p>A second issue, which is very linked, is the fact that I read a lot. Reading does make me tired, which, I imagine is plus, but it's even thought provoking. I'm not a fan of novels so I tend to read factual books..",1347808151

What we perceive as ""mind"" is the emergent property of immensely complex physical (chemical) interactions in the brain. Now that is not to say that SSRIs are the best or most effective treatment for depression. I simply object to your attempt to sort problems neatly into exclusive buckets of ""neurology"" vs. ""psychology."" You can't just hand-wave away the topic of drugs by saying ""oh that's just a psychological problem.""",1347807996

4529256,comment,4528379,4529222,2,0,karterk,,,"Exactly. Sometimes, it pays to be detached. You can be passionate about something, but still be somewhat detached from it. The minute you let something/someone determine and define your life, you lose sight of the larger picture. And, the reality is that nothing lasts ever. Time and again, I have seen people surprise me - in both good and disappointing ways.<p>It's very difficult to find contentment in oneself - most people will call it a cynical and pathetic look at life. However, that's what life is. At the risk of sounding cliched - it's YOUR journey on the train. Everyone departs along the way. Some you will get to know more than others, but at the end of the day being aware that it's your journey and yours alone helps you not get attached to other things that might eventually end-up crumbling your world.",1347807668

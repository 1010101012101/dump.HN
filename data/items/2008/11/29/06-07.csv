379951,comment,379942,379942,0,0,jmtame,,,"Which school do you go to?<p>I find my own school to be pointless in terms of teaching me something I couldn't easily figure out on my own.  I wish it were more of a ""pick your own topic of study"" type of thing.  Only newer schools are beginning to do this.  Olin College has a terrific engineering curriculum that is project-oriented, prevents faculty from being on >5 year tenure, and allows the entire curriculum to be reviewed and voted on each year.<p>My challenge at school has not been learning material, it has been finding people who are as driven and ambitious as I am.  I see that as the only real value a university has: it's a petri dish of intelligence, but there's only a few people who are going to be just as driven as you are.<p>I am done with school in about 1.5 years and I still regret how this system is designed.  I would say find a startup and go work for them.  Get paid to learn, instead of the opposite in college, where the quality of material is usually very low.  Get to know the very smart and driven employees and co-founders.  When you have a nest egg built up, go and try to startup with someone.",1227941940
379950,comment,379942,379942,0,0,qhoxie,,,"It sounds like you have a really solid background outside of academia.  That said, I would not advise dropping out at this point.  The reason being that you did not mention any concrete plans or anything pulling you directly away from school.<p>Feeling that it does not have a purpose for you is valid and understandable, but there is probably a lot to going through college that you haven't taken into consideration (internships, finding partners, etc) that could be very beneficial.<p>My final thought would be that if you at some point in the near future have something immediate that you want/<i>need</i> to do, then it might be a viable option.  At this point, though, I would stick it out.",1227941848

379942,story,,,27,54,liuliu,"Ask HN: Should I drop out or not?",,"I am a 21-year-old undergrad student in a public university. A little old for freshman actually. After high school study, I spent one year in lab, and another year trying to start up sth. As I don't achieve any significant thing that can insure the rest of my life, then I said, go to United States and try some luck. But after the half year study, I didn't see any purpose of the college life.<p>I have learned basic math skills such as differential equations and linear algebra in high school. I self-taught algorithms and c/c++. I am an active contributor to opensource community. Recent two years, I mastered several scripting languages (js, php, python etc.) to accomplish a web project. Especially in computer vision area, I have many experiences. When I participate icpc contest, I saw what 4-year student done. That scared me. They don't have basic programming instinct.<p>Indeed, a diploma can make life much easier by getting a job in Microsoft or Google and my college's rank is not that bad at all (around 20+). But I don't want to spent so much money in next 3.5 year and gain nothing. Besides, getting a job in big company and establishing own career after 30+ seems not so interesting to me.",1227941355

The best way to find that was Craigslist.  I live in a cottage behind someone's house in the middle of Mountain View.  The rent is reasonable, I get along great with my landlord, and it's a very comfortable situation.<p>It's a shame things aren't set up more like Australia.  Most apartments there are all privately owned, generally between 8-40 per complex, and a far nicer overall experience.",1227941163

Symantec Endpoint Security is reporting some activity that is in fact happening but is not malicious. To achieve its high level of sandbox security, BaseShield in some cases loads dlls into other processes.\nThis is a common technique that is natively supported by the Windows API and is in itself perfectly safe. We will investigate how this can be avoided and try to make sure BaseShield does not trigger these warnings with this product.<p>Again, apologies for the inconvenience. Please contact me directly at sascha (at) baseshield.com if you have any questions about this.<p>UPDATE:\nSymantec Endpoint Protection appears to be prone to showing false alerts.

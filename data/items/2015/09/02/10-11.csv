Take those four disks (you need four at minimum) in your RAID6. Your array can survive two disk failures. Now I build a RAID1 with four disks. Mine can survive three disk failures.</i><p>Apples and oranges again...<p><i>> Yes, there&#x27;s a capacity hit, but it&#x27;s been repeatedly established that it&#x27;s not capacity that matters.</i><p>This is not established. This is something you keep saying but makes no sense. My NAS has 4 2TB disks, I&#x27;ve configured it as RAID6 for 4TB of space where any two disks can fail. RAID10 is strictly inferior to that and RAID1 would only give me 2TB of space which is not enough for me. This result is generalizable. For a given number of disks and a given target array usable size the n-parity RAID configuration always has superior redundancy to the RAID10 configuration, there&#x27;s no way around that.<p><i>>Your points are much more valid when they&#x27;re targeted at RAID10 instead of the concept of mirroring in general.</i><p>My points have always been about RAID10 and not RAID1. If RAID1 is enough that&#x27;s always the better option as obviously it&#x27;s not possible to improve on &quot;you have N disks and N-1 of them can fail&quot;.<p>Note that&#x27;s also the reason RAID5 implementations are limited to 3 disks minimum and RAID6 to 4 disks minimum. In theory you could configure a RAID5 with 2 (1+1parity) and a RAID6 with 3 (1+2parity) but since it doesn&#x27;t make sense to calculate parity of a single disk that just ends up meaning RAID1.",1441191523

The 2008 crisis and the European Crisis were both caused by an unsustainable build up of <i>private</i> debt. The levels of public debt had nothing to do with it<p>Even in Europe where there was multiple sovereign debt crises, the debts all started out in the private sector and were later shifted on to the public balance sheet. Same story in Spain, Ireland, Slovakia, etc. (even Greece to a large extent).<p>>once you have more debt than you can ever afford to repay<p>&quot;Afford to pay&quot; means something different to governments than it does to the rest of us. Governments that print their own currency cannot run out of it. The only decision they have to make regarding the deficit is &quot;is the current level of inflation too much?&quot;<p>Austerity in the UK and the US is thus kind of like saying &quot;well, we must stop spending money because what if we run out of little green bits of paper&quot;. It would be funny how stupid it is if it weren&#x27;t so devastating.<p>Similarly in the EU inflation is rock bottom and the ECB could kickstart every ailing economy easily. They just don&#x27;t want to.<p>>Since you refer to Greece in your other comment - I am more concerned about the politics than about the economics, given they don&#x27;t default even though they have a clear democratic mandate.<p>Greece has unfortunately handed over control of their payments system to the ECB and wresting back control is not something that can be done in under 9 months.<p>Thus it doesn&#x27;t really matter what the Greek government says or what their electorate wants - if they don&#x27;t follow Troika orders they flip a switch and the economy seizes up completely. Instant 3rd world status. No jobs, no money, no food, no life saving drugs.<p>This is why successive Greek governments have done the opposite of what they were elected to do. They have a gun against their heads and Schauble is just itching to pull the trigger if they don&#x27;t fall in line.",1441191271

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We’re self funded and doubling yearly. As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we’re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>◦ <i>skill</i>: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>◦ <i>desire to learn</i>: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>◦ <i>understanding</i>: our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You’ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>◦ <i>clear communication</i>: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again. Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight. So, if you’ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

First, perhaps they should remember that a lot of the foundations of mathematical economics were laid by people way above their paygrade. I&#x27;m talking about von Neumann, for example, or Fischer Black. Usually, when smart people do something that does not make sense to you, you take a step back and ask what <i>you</i> might be missing, and usually there is a nontrivial answer to that question. Paul Romer, sorry, is a good economist but he has a BS in math. I would say that&#x27;s my definition of a &quot;lightweight when it comes to equations&quot;. That&#x27;s not to say he shouldn&#x27;t criticize, he should! But let&#x27;s not pretend that there was no reason to &quot;go formal&quot; in economic theorizing or that there were/are easy modeling choices.<p>3) In my experience, most of the criticism of economic models comes from ignorance of the goal and context of a model and a too literal reading of the math. For example, if you take Markowitz&#x27;s portfolio optimization (mean vs variance of a linear combination of a multivariate normal), it is correct that individual returns have non-exponentially decaying &quot;heavy&quot; tails, the copula is not (unconditionally) Gaussian, and risk is therefore not captured in variance and correlations (not least because they may in fact be undefined). But that is completely beside the point of the model, which is simply to express the idea that the risk of a portfolio is not necessarily additive and that there is a tradeoff between risk and return. The point being, although it is expressed in mathematical language, it is actually a qualitative model. Once you realize this difference to more descriptive models in the sciences, economic theory starts to make a lot more sense.<p>4) The real problem of economic theory may be the disconnect between how many people have a stake in it and how many people have the time and leisure and inclination and background to understand what the theorists are actually saying.<p>5) Side comment and half-reply to <i>ThePhysicist</i>&#x27;s complaint: The reason to go with the &quot;perfect gas&quot;-type models in economic theory, I think, is that you are dealing with self-interested, utility-maximizing particles or &quot;agents&quot; -> acting particles. The thinking being that if you put in constraints of some form, say a short-sales constraint in a financial market model, you make the model very special. But in the messy real world agents would find a way around this particular constraint eventually. So the unconstrained general equilibrium models are trying to give you a big picture, &quot;this is where the market tends to&quot; type of result. There is so much more to be said on this point but I&#x27;m already way above my allocated time for this &quot;duty call&quot;...<p>6) Last but not least, let me state my opinion that there is nothing inherently noble about science. It is a method to gain knowledge, and it is contingent on the affordances of the field to which it is applied. In economic theory, your basic problem is lack of data. Now that may change in some subfields, and that&#x27;s great. So the scientific method can be applied in those subfields eventually. But we need answers or opinions today for practical problems. I see economics as akin to philosophy how Russell [2] understood it. Let me quote him:<p><i>“Philosophy, as I shall understand the word, is something intermediate between theology and science. Like theology, it consists of speculations on matters as to which definite knowledge has, so far, been unascertainable; but like science, it appeals to human reason rather than to authority, whether that of tradition or that of revelation. All definite knowledge—so I should contend—belongs to science; all dogma as to what surpasses definite knowledge belongs to theology. But between theology and science there is a No Man’s Land, exposed to attack from both sides; this No Man’s Land is philosophy. Almost all the questions of most interest to speculative minds are such as science cannot answer, and the confident answers of theologians no longer seem so convincing as they did in former centuries.”</i><p>One should be aware of the limits of this approach but one should also not assume that there was a choice between science and this. If there was, it wouldn&#x27;t even be a contest! The realm of science may get bigger over time, as more and more data is gathered, but again, we need answers today and in real time, not in 100 years, to decide on regulations, interest rates, portfolios or budgeting decisions. In almost all the big economic questions, your sample size is one and the possibility to experiment is nil. The world is arguably nonstationary on time-scales that matter, economic mechanisms change, and every statistical test and computational experiment is always a joint hypothesis test of your assumptions, about which I said in (1) above that there is and perhaps can be no consensus.<p>In short, it&#x27;s not that people don&#x27;t know there is a problem. It&#x27;s that there has so far been no better solution.<p>______________________<p>[1] I&#x27;m just making this definition up on the fly but if someone has a better one, I&#x27;m all ears.<p>[2] B.

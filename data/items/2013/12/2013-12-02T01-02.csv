Quoting a well-articulated email from yet another reader who felt deceived by the trickery; and,<p>2. (After a preface stating how he finds it amusing that so many people are bothered about this button) The following high-level technical overview of <i>what happens</i> behind the scenes when someone&#x27;s kudos are volunteered willy-nilly:<p><pre><code>  Here’s what it actually does: when you hover over the button, a CSS transform animation is activated which fills \n  the circle. After 1 second (the length of the animation), it fires a request to the server which increments an \n  otherwise meaningless number by exactly one.\n</code></pre>\nThis is the full extent of his response. As far as I could figure out, this &quot;response to criticism&quot; addresses the following introductory paragraph of his interlocutor&#x27;s email:<p><pre><code>  I was curious about the Kudos button you mention in your http://dcurt.is/web-standards article. I hovered over it \n  with my mouse pointer, and then it said “don’t move”. I didn’t move. Then it said “sent”. Apparently someone \n  invented a button that does not need to be pressed in order to be triggered.\n</code></pre>\nAnd totally ignores the sentiment communicated by the more weighty second paragraph which concludes with:<p><pre><code>  I very humbly request that you kindly decrement the Kudos statistic by one unit in order to compensate for the \n  one that I definitely did not intend to send until it was forcefully withdrawn from me by a deceitful human \n  interface.\n</code></pre>\nDid Dustin Curtis really miss the subtle (svbtle?) sarcasm of that first paragraph, or am I just imagining things?",1385949570

I have a situation here that&#x27;s probably similar to some of you and I&#x27;m hoping any of you can shed some light.  Got into bitcoin trading last 3 weeks ago on localbitcoins and I&#x27;ve made some gains due to recent spike in btc price.  I&#x27;ve probably made purchases around $1,400 at most.  Some of my deals were done with buyers who are also outside the country and converted to USD.  Would that constitute my activities as illegal?  I just recently read about the FINCEN regulation and I&#x27;ve now decided to stop trading bitcoins.  Am I still obligated to register at FINCEN as an MSB even if I&#x27;m planning to discontinue after 3-4 weeks of trading?  Would I be fine if I just honestly report my gains in my income tax?  Or should I fear anyone coming knocking at my door?  Please advise.  Thanks so much and I would really appreciate it if you can shed some information.",1385949431

6830733,comment,6830076,6830076,2,0,mdisraeli,,,"As the poster on 4chan concludes, you may not want to speak to the police about such things. However, not doing so could potentially result in accusations of knowing but not reporting a crime, or worse - destruction of evidence. I suspect there&#x27;s no winning here, sadly :(<p>What follows is my initial thoughts off the top of my head as to how I might attempt to mitigate any accusations. This is not legal advice.<p>Firstly, if it looks to have been deliberately concealed, contact your building&#x27;s security and/or the police (non-emergency). Don&#x27;t touch it yourself at all. I cannot stress this enough. When contacting the police, ask them for instructions on what you should do, and get a name. If you can&#x27;t stay at the scene until someone arrives, just tell them as much. You should be given a reference number and can update them if you need to be relived by someone.<p>Odds are, an unknown concealed item that is not likely to be an explosive or drugs is probably of little interest to your typical cop, and (sadly?) they will never get around to looking at it.<p>There might be some legitimate reasons to investigate further, for example with respect to an organisation&#x27;s security. If you are in a large organisation, escalate the matter upwards and touch nothing, no matter how tempting. For many good reasons, security/fraud investigations often are on a strict need-to-know basis. Get the appropriate person to contact the police and take their guidance.<p>Let&#x27;s assume for the purpose of this post that you are the right person, and there is no existing investigation which this may relate to. Your natural curiosity should be ignored, however, unless you have a genuine concern of data exfiltration or other potentially malicious activities.<p>But who I am kidding, of course you do, most organisations do! Now you need to make sure you can preserve as much evidence as possible, perform a detailed investigation, but all the time protect yourself from both legal and technical risks. What follows assumes high risk. Do your own judgement on the risks involved and if the steps below mitigate them adequately (they are probably over the top, this is not a bad thing). Assume that before and after each of these there is a &quot;Listen to the police and/or your legal team&quot;.<p>1. Photograph in situ first, ideally with some means to date the photograph. If possible, get a second person involved. If the area is covered by CCTV, get the footage pulled for cross-referencing. Photographs are useful for the higher resolution details.<p>1a. Record everything on video.<p>2. Speaking of CCTV, you&#x27;ll want to get someone to look at the tapes. This is left as an exercise for the reader, especially the bit about making it not soul-destroying manual observation. This point also covers all the non-technical but essential things like &quot;who had access to this area&quot;, &quot;do we stock that type of device&quot;, etc. Never forget that the old-fashioned non-technical questions can often give the best answers.<p>2. Use gloves and carefully remove the device. Take note of the environment it was in, with special interest for clues as to how long it has been there. Examine briefly for any markings. Place immediately into clear plastic bag, marking it with a description of the contents and ideally adding tamper seals. Clear plastic bag means you can verify the device hasn&#x27;t changed. When not performing investigatory work, the bag should be locked in a dedicated place for evidential material.<p>3. Establish an air-gapped secure system to perform analysis on. Assume that malware will be present and that you will want to be able to detect and analyse it. Ideally have an investigations laboratory to add physical controls around the air-gap.<p>4. Establish a log book. Record the date, time, action taken, and tamper seal codes before and after. There will be more things you will wish to record, of course - this is only a rough guide.<p>5. Acquire a write-block device. These are utterly essential for any form of forensic investigation, and typically block at (what courts consider to be) hardware-level any modification to the device.<p>6. Attach the device to your air-gapped system using the write-blocker. At this point, the air-gapped system is dirty and will need to be forensically wiped/destroyed once you are finished.<p>7. Using Encase, similar forensic tools, or failing that GNU dd_rescue, image the device. Never, ever, work off the original device. The police and/or auditors may want to take their own copy, this is normal.<p>8. With respect to the log book, treat this image like the original device. This log book is what you use to back up &quot;I was performing a security investigation&quot;. This includes any automated testing or password cracking you attempt.<p>9. If your organisation handles classified information, it goes without saying that identifying if any is present is your top priority - no matter what the implications that then has<p>10. Limit who gets to actually view the data on the device to an absolute minimum. You don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s there, it could be personal HR information or finances, or that hush-hush restructuring project. The fewer eyes the better. Ideally this should be someone trained in forensic examination and with a high enough clearance to view any potential contents.<p>11. Know when to give up. Seriously, you could spend years diving into the contents of a 64GB device, and never actually get anything useful.<p>12. Ask a legal person about how long to retain the device for once you&#x27;ve finished.<p>13. Assuming you have identified that the contents need further examination, look into eDiscovery tools like Symantec Clearwell, and visualisation tools like the excellent Gephi. Perform technical wizardry rather than wading through a hundred thousand files manually. You&#x27;re reading hacker news, remember! ;)<p>14. Assuming that the police have been involved, update them. However if it really is an unknown item and there is otherwise little that is suspicious, they probably won&#x27;t be that interested and/or will close the call silently.<p>Apparently I Am Not A Lawyer, And I Repeatedly Assert This Fact. I work in IT Security, and have been involved in quite a few investigations or varying types. Due to their nature, we knew the source of the data on most occasions, so many of the above steps were unnecessary.

6830688,comment,6828721,6829736,5,0,jjoonathan,,,"> universities usually are not funding that conversion<p>Yes, they are. Universities are essentially a combination of a hackerspace with a startup accelerator, they have just grown to the point that you don&#x27;t recognize them as such. The services they provide are essential to starting companies requiring more infrastructure than a laptop computer. They provide the multi-million dollar cleanrooms required to do nanoscale fabrication, the multi-million dollar spectrometers and chromatography setups required for chemical and biological engineering, seats on even the most expensive mathematical and physical simulation software, and mechanical prototyping facilities. They house a collection of experts, technicians, and cheap skilled labor (grad students) the likes of which cannot be found anywhere else or bought for less than a small fortune. They have industry connections that span many different market sectors and they have respect from society at large that gives them special dispensation to perform certain kinds of risky experiments (medical trials, chemical synthesis with reagents that could be re-purposed to produce drugs/explosives/nerve gas, and nuclear reactions). They even provide small stipends for their tinkerers.<p>These things cost money, yet many of them are advantageous or essential for starting a company, depending on the field (do you really think you can develop a next-gen neural interface, MEMS sensor, or drug delivery mechanism in your garage?). The arrangement is simple: a spun-out company can repurpose research done using these facilities if they promise to give the university IP revenue (the specifics of which are negotiated on a case-by-case basis). The nice thing about using patents to carry out this process is that they can be negotiated retroactively. Startup accelerators require equity up front, but that&#x27;s not a workable arrangement if you won&#x27;t know how commercializable your product will be until <i>after</i> you have spent your research budget.<p>I would hate to see this side of patent law disappear. Such &quot;reformation&quot; might just succeed in turning the university into the sterile ivory tower of arcane, pointless tinkering you seem to think it is. We need to fix patent law, not eliminate it.",1385948502

6830589,comment,6788411,6792745,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> And what about the algorithms that measure and control the thrust and the robots that make the chassis and compute the folding that leads to drug design?<p>What about them? They&#x27;re software. Get a copyright or keep it as a trade secret.<p>> Functional things cannot be covered by copyright. If it&#x27;s the functionality itself that is novel, no amount of copyright can protect it.<p>Which is kind of the point -- it&#x27;s really the whole problem with software patents. In software there are enormously many widely differing but still sensible ways, i.e. different functions, that all accomplish the same result. Such that in order to have a valuable patent you have to try to patent the idea itself or any computation of the relevant law of mathematics or physics or the intended outcome rather than any particular way to do it, otherwise anyone competent could easily come up with a thousand other ways to do the same thing just as well. So software patents end up being either so abstract that they&#x27;re abstract ideas or sufficiently specific that anyone can easily avoid them. And companies don&#x27;t even attempt to get the second kind because it&#x27;s a waste of money, so instead they spend all their efforts convincing the patent office to improperly issue the first kind.<p>Function is effectively irrelevant here, only outcome is relevant. If you have code to take input from set X and map to output from set X&#x27; then that code is fungible with any other piece of code that produces the same mapping from X to X&#x27;, regardless of <i>how</i> it does it. The only practical consideration is whether the performance of some particular implementation is inadequate, which is clearly not a significant point of contention in the majority of software patent cases. So instead of patenting the software equivalent of &quot;brake pad compressed against rotating disc by caliper with hydraulic actuator&quot; they patent the software equivalent of &quot;car slows down&quot; and now they want to sue anybody with a vehicle capable of decelerating.<p>Because in a car it matters whether you have disc brakes or drum brakes because disc brakes stop better and fade slower and they cost a different amount of money and wear at different rates etc. etc., which are very important characteristics when choosing what kind of brakes to design a car with. In a computer it doesn&#x27;t really matter most of the time whether you use a linked list or an array or a red black tree or a hash table. Some choices will be faster than others or use more or less memory, but that&#x27;s about it, and for the most part that isn&#x27;t what the patent system is concerned about. But that&#x27;s the nature of function in computer science: Different functions can <i>easily</i> produce the same outcome, just with different efficiency. So in order to patent something others can&#x27;t easily avoid, you have to patent the result rather than the function. Which isn&#x27;t supposed to be allowed.<p>> A watch mechanism is essentially a series of cascaded counters. X &quot;ticks&quot; of one gear = Y &quot;ticks&quot; of another gear. It&#x27;s an algorithm: if (m++ == 60) h++; You&#x27;ll find such physical implementations of algorithms all over the place if you know where to look, especially in automation, from factories to toasters.<p>But you aren&#x27;t patenting the algorithm, you&#x27;re patenting the mechanism. This is made clear by the fact that no software or arrangement of transistors or equivalent logic gates can possibly be made that would infringe the patent claims on the watch mechanism. Because you aren&#x27;t patenting the outcome (&quot;keeps time&quot;), you&#x27;re patenting the mechanism. Every watch since the beginning of time (so to speak) has operated with the algorithm &quot;if (m++ == 60) h++;&quot; and yet novel watch mechanisms continue to be patented on a regular basis, because they patent something <i>other than</i> the algorithm.<p>> Most software patents don&#x27;t cover the abstract algorithm, they cover the application of that algorithm.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right in this case. Unless by &quot;application&quot; you mean some artificial and irrelevant limitation like the one you&#x27;re pointing out with business entities vs. vacationers. Allowing that to make something unpatentable into something patentable is how we get into this mess. It&#x27;s like the classic &quot;that thing we all know about, but on the internet&quot; patent. It would be like allowing Jules Verne to patent &quot;rocket for traveling to the moon&quot; the day after Sputnik launched and proved rockets could make it into orbit, providing no additional utility or novelty other than the arbitrary limitation that it must be used to travel to the moon. How is that worthy of a patent?<p>What you should need for a patent is some actual implementation of the abstract idea. An &quot;application&quot; of &quot;rocket for traveling to the moon&quot; is the Lunar Module, not a claim of launching any unspecified rocket in the general direction of the moon. Which is all adding some frivolous field of use limitation to a mathematical algorithm is doing.<p>> No, but do you mean to say that the majority of software startups are doing technically innovative work? Heck, look at the much vaunted YC companies. How many are doing something beyond some variation of CRUD?<p>I think some of them are. Most of them probably aren&#x27;t. The obvious problem is that VCs are throwing money around and it attracts people who are more interested in getting rich so they can retire rather than building something epic. But you can identify small companies that are doing good creative work, e.g. Whisper Systems.<p>> I&#x27;m sorry, I live outside the HN bubble, so I completely disagree that Microsoft and IBM don&#x27;t do innovative work.<p>Oh sure, if you measure the amount of research they do in absolute terms then it&#x27;s a lot because they&#x27;re such large entities. But in terms of a percentage of their revenue? Or their ratio of engineer hours spent doing actual research vs. engineer and lawyer hours spent on patent prosecution?<p>> The vast, vast majority involves translating pre-existing business logic into code. And most software startups are not much different.<p>We get all the rage against &quot;do X on a computer&quot; patents, but as it turns out, even if &quot;do X on a computer&quot; is bleeding obvious and shouldn&#x27;t be patentable, it can also be highly profitable because the pre-computer solution was &quot;do X manually.&quot;<p>But I&#x27;m not sure this is much different from other industries. Drug companies regularly announce minor (but newly patented) improvements to their previous drugs just as the previous versions fall out of patent. Medical device companies spend an enormous amount of time and money to get very conservative designs approved by the FDA. The ability of Tesla to combine a Lotus with a thousand laptop batteries and produce an electric car is not nothing, but it&#x27;s more a testament to the massive failure of their predecessors to do it first. And why is it that I have the same speed ethernet interface in my PC today as a 400MHz PowerMac G4 had in 2000?<p>> Well, then maybe we need to make it cheaper to file &quot;software&quot; patents and make them more powerful so they afford some real protection? :-)<p>You&#x27;re going to make the trolling problem a lot worse then, what about that?<p>> For every paper saying software patents harm entrants, there&#x27;s one saying the opposite<p>Then clearly half of them are wrong.<p>>There are even studies suggesting that thickets helped innovation by centralizing licensing efforts.<p>If there were no software patents then there would be no need or benefit in centralized licensing. Moreover, centralized licensing is very similar to a lack of patents (i.e. results in more competition than a single incumbent with a concrete patent monopoly), but notably differs by creating a wealth transfer from newcomers to incumbents, which would tend to result in less innovation by discouraging challengers and protecting incumbents, leading to less competition and consequently less competitive pressure to innovate.<p>> It&#x27;s not just in software that VCs look for patents. [etc.]<p>The point is, maintaining the existence of software patents in order to retain them as a signal to VCs is the tail wagging the dog.",1385947608

At the expense of additional complexity in implementation and more memory overhead, you could reduce lookup to, OTOH, O(log n) by using a skip-list<p>4: you do not iterate through the list often - if you do, you are likely going to blow the cache and mess up prefetching due to poor cache locality. Iterating through an array-based data structure can be much faster in this case.<p>I would say that for a list to make sense, you MUST have 1 and 2 and probably should have 3. 4 is optional, but if true, should make you consider if there might not be a more suitable data structure. In my own personal experience, this is rare. In fact, in my own personal experience, usually, code either does not require 1 or requires 1 but not 2 - either way, lists are not the appropriate data structure in those cases.<p>Basically, the short version is that they have very poor cache locality, an (IMHO) narrow use case where other data structures don&#x27;t have superior performance and they take up more memory per node than a lot of other types of lists.<p>You linked to a stackoverflow question in another comment saying that they attribute std::list&#x27;s flaws to linked lists as a whole. The biggest issue they seemed to mention, though, was cache locality - I fail to see how intrusive linked lists solve this. The only solution would be to preallocate nodes in consecutive memory locations, but you still take a hit as the links take up memory (whereas in array-based lists you do not need to store links for each node) and if you need to insert/delete in the middle (why are you using linked lists if this isn&#x27;t the case?) then you end up jumping around the preallocated nodes anyway and after a while will lose any cache-friendliness you may have had.<p>Maybe you can elaborate what you meant?<p>To end with an appeal to authority ;-) I&#x27;ll quote tptacek[1]:<p><i>C programmers are trained to use linked lists. They are the first variable-length containers most programmers come into contact with and so C programmers tend to be imprinted on them like ducklings. Linked lists are a poor general purpose container.</i><p>EDIT: I guess I missed an anti-condition: if you don&#x27;t care about performance, then use whatever models your problem best, which may well be a linked list (though the same is true for std::list).<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4455676"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4455676</a>",1385947570

This kind of operation is what lists are for, and std::list canonically cannot do it.<p>Any other operation you might want to do relating to the list, given such a pointer is impossible (e.g: create a new request that is immediately between the old request and its next).<p>All this assumes your object is within just one list. If it is within 2 lists, you have to use an extra indirection: std::list <request * >, which makes the problem worse. Even if you do find your request via one of the lists, there is no way to get an iterator for the other list. That means you cannot do any of the list operations on the other list. Again: This is the canonical thing lists were designed for, and std::list cannot do it.<p>Say that to solve this, you use the intrusive style with std::list.  i.e: for every list this object is a member of, you hold an iterator inside your object.<p>Now the onus is on your to maintain these iterators, in <i>addition</i> to the common list operations. i.e: If you add an element, you need to both call std::list::add, <i>and</i> update the iterator.<p>Additionally, instead of paying with 2 pointers for each node, as an ordinary doubly-linked list should cost, you have to pay with an extra pointer or two (depending on how the iterator is implemented)!<p>If you use multiple lists with std::list<request * >, you pay with an extra pointer yet!<p>So if your data structure is within 2 doubly-linked lists, instead of paying the ideal 4 pointers per item, you pay those 4 + 1(indirection) + (2 for two iterators). 75% memory overhead, ruining your cache lines.<p>The code will be a mess too, due to the duplicate maintenance.<p>The alternative is much simpler:\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~baker/devices/lxr/http/source/linux/include/linux/list.h\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~baker/devices/lxr/http/source/linux/i...</a><p>Use the intrusive approach <i>exclusively</i>. So that you don&#x27;t need to use a list::add <i>in addition</i> to maintaining the two iterators. You <i>only</i> maintain the &quot;iterators&quot; (now called &quot;list heads&quot;).<p>So your request would look like:<p><pre><code>  struct request { struct list_head list1, list2; };\n</code></pre>\nTo add it to a list:<p><pre><code>  list_add(&request->list1, &some_list_head);\n</code></pre>\nGiven a request, you can delete it in O(1) from both lists:<p><pre><code>  list_del(&request->list1);\n  list_del(&request->list2);\n</code></pre>\nEasy to use and optimal memory use (exactly 2 pointers per list head).<p>Now, given some pointer from list2, to get back a request, you use:<p><pre><code>  struct list_head *some_ptr = ...;\n  struct request *req =\n    containerof(some_ptr, struct request, list2);\n</code></pre>\nThis is slightly-boilerplatey, so I tend to write a little wrapper:<p><pre><code>  struct request *request_of_list2(struct list_head *ptr) {\n    return containerof(ptr, struct request, list2);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nEDIT: almost completely forgot that std::list also uses new to dynamically allocate elements. This effectively means the cost of adding to lists is many times greater than the simple list_add function. Even if you supply your own allocator, this is unnecessarily expensive and by default means that list::add, like remove, are both not O(1) like they ought to be.",1385946885

6830524,comment,6829725,6829725,107,0,lemmsjid,,,"I&#x27;d say a lot of the critiques are fair but quite exaggerated.  I work on a large Scala codebase and yes, the compile times for a fresh start across the codebase are very long, but TDD-type loops are very short, because you&#x27;re generally waiting for two files (your test target and your test code).  Still, the compiler performance in Scala is perhaps my chief criticism, though hardly a show-stopper.  As codebases in any language grow, you tend to have increasing challenges in the time it takes to fire up your environment.<p>The critique about excessive and opaque operator use in libraries is fair, though I think it actually exposes an interesting philosophical issue.  Scala is unabashedly written to be a flexible language.  This is in opposition to Java, which was written to be a very strict language in terms of expressiveness on the part of the developer (it&#x27;s perhaps the most strict of the languages I&#x27;ve worked with, hence it being my example).  I personally think a lot of criticisms leveled against Java&#x27;s verbosity and inflexibility are unfair, by virtue of the following: Many incredibly successful and complex open source projects are written in Java.  While you could say this stems from Java&#x27;s enormous popularity, one interesting property of huge Java open-source projects is that I can usually crack open the code and quickly get a sense of how I could contribute to the system without breaking it.  While other languages often do a better job of giving me a sense of how the system works, I generally have much trouble with extensibility unless it&#x27;s Java.  This I believe is because Java was designed from the ground up with the goal of limiting individual developer expressivity in favor of imagining large development teams with limited cross communication.<p>So--I am far less anti-Java than most.  But I am a big fan of Scala.  Unlike Java, Scala was written to maximize developer expressivity.  While writing Java can feel like putting together a legal contract, writing Scala can feel like creating a poem.  I&#x27;m not making a value judgement in either direction there--I feel that poetry is a good metaphor, because things in Scala tend to fall apart in the reading department.  One of the easiest things to do in poetry is to lose the reader--a great poet can put an incredibly complicated multilayered concept onto a small amount of paper--and require a graduate-level understanding from the reader to understand it.  Similarly, one can very easily make Scala into an exercise in unpacking<p>So isn&#x27;t that a bad thing?  Why am I a Scala fan?  Going back to my initial praise of Java--Java is so simple and predictable that it&#x27;s really easy to see how the plumbing works.  But because the plumbing must be laid out so meticulously and in every situation, it is often hard to see how things work at a high level.  You can&#x27;t see an architectural sketch in Java, you can only see endless classes in endlessly nested subdirectories.  This is a very low level of abstraction, and helps the layperson (such as someone approaching a new open source project) build up an understanding from the base elements.  But what&#x27;s lacking is the high level abstraction.<p>Outside of programming languages, almost every knowledge discipline has a high level abstraction language--sometimes multiple languages.  Usually the abstraction language is opaque to newcomers, and frustratingly so.  Examples are the mathematical notations of various disciplines, the jargon-laden meta-language of historical theory/literary criticism, and what is popularly known as &#x27;legalese&#x27;.  But even less high falutin&#x27; fields have similar languages--listening to sports fans talking about what&#x27;s happening can be quite mystifying to me, given all of the shorthand they&#x27;re using.  Similarly people talking about pop culture in areas I&#x27;m not familiar with.<p>These ubiquitous high level languages usually share two important facets: first, in a few lines of text/speech, you can pack in many books&#x27; worth of concepts.  Second, unless someone has read those books, they will have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about (or in the case of pop culture jargon, having spent the requisite hundreds of hours watching movies).  Scala is trying to provide a language that can express the low level plumbing as Java can, but also that can express the high level meta-language.  In doing so, it opens itself to the same type of criticism that mathematical notation can receive--opacity.<p>The pitfall, then, of Scala library developers is to create a high level meta-language (a DSL), that doesn&#x27;t have industry acceptance.  This is tantamount to mathematicians who create their own notation to establish proofs--such proofs can be completely unreadable to their colleagues.  But this isn&#x27;t a criticism that should be leveled at the idea of notation period--it&#x27;s a matter of people learning to accept useful obfuscation (where jargon can reduce textual size and increase understanding) and reject useless obfuscation (inventing your own dialect of shorthand and forcing your readers to learn non-transferrable knowledge to understand what you wrote).<p>Because they are working with such a flexible language, and one that is targeted at building high abstraction languages, Scala library developers need to think of their audience--terseness by itself is not useful, unless you&#x27;re writing throwaway code.  If you&#x27;re going to unleash a DSL on your reader, make sure it&#x27;s in a real dialogue with the reader&#x27;s expected level of knowledge with regards to how such a DSL should be structured in terms of what the symbols should mean and how they fit together.<p>I don&#x27;t know how the Scala story will end, but I do believe that it is one of the few languages that reaches for an expressivity goal that needs to be achieved by at least some future language.  Its reaching opens it to much criticism, and rightfully so, but I appreciate it for its ambition.",1385946880

If you live as if it is, something bad is probably going to happen to you eventually.

Perhaps not. Is any part of this story even true? Also perhaps not.",1385946001

I love it, but I don&#x27;t think I could possible realize (or notice) the increase in capability unless working heavily in graphics and video, and that&#x27;s assuming that the machine attached to it has a card that takes advantage of it.",1385946000

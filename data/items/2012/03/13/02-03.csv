Python 3.3 will make it easier to port Python 2 projects and provide more incentives to upgrade. There's also nearly a critical percentage of major packages ported, and Django (which is still on Python 2, and is a deal breaker for many people) will have experimental support for versions up to 3.3.<p>I expect that by this time next year, the default for most new projects will be Python 3.",1331607562

I get a ""via"" shout-out from The Verge once when I tracked down an official contradiction to one of their rumor-articles.

3696782,comment,3694672,3694672,2,0,lkbrunswick,,,"The concept of copyright made sense under the old technologies because it was practical to outlaw counterfeiting.  Suppose, for instance, you decided to counterfeit a best-selling novel.  You would need to spend many thousands of dollars to set the printing plates, plus have a printing factory to produce the thousands of copies needed to repay your investment, plus a big distribution network.  If the police were at all interested in enforcing the law, it would be only a few days before someone discovered that the book was being counterfeited, and easy to trace it back to the printing factory, and the whole operation would be shut down (and the fellow running it thrown in jail), long before a profit could be made.<p>With computers and the internet, all that changes. The capital investment to pirate IP property becomes effectively zero, and it is difficult or impossible to trace the source. So copyright laws are simply not practical.  It is similar to what happened with Prohibition in the US, it turned out to be just not workable.",1331607185

3696780,comment,3694079,3694079,3,0,toddkaufmann,,,"I think this is a good piece for what it addresses.  However,  market capitalism (or whatever it is we have) is more complex.<p>This does not address the issue of monopsony:  I may like my corner store, and spend my money there, but long-term they are going to fall to Wal-Mart because everyone ends up shopping there, because Wal-Mart has the power to dictate to its suppliers what the price to them will be.  I guess the software equivalent is App-Mart.<p>Similarly, if I have a cool new device, but major platform wants big bucks for me to get ""certified"" as interoperable or to include my driver, this could be a stumbling block.  (However it seems like standards have really been adopted, and the internet is widespread enough that this might no longer be an issue.)<p>Overall, I think the playing field is really being leveled now, with widespread network access and clouds and stuff.  I (we) might be too exposed to the free and open possibilities, but it does seem like there is (has been?) a revolution.<p>Is software political?  After internet access being a basic human right, should the right to choose ones software be one as well?",1331607168

It's because those that really understand people and these tactics appreciate how valuable it really is and more importantly know how to make you want to throw gobs of money at them for this information!!!<p>Here is what I can tell you without getting in trouble. \nPeople take action because of emotional reasons, and justify that decision with logic and ""objective"" reasons to defend their decision to others.<p>Every single thing you want your users to do is causing them pain. They do not want to click... Before they do even the simplest thing possible, they will rack their brain for excuses to not do it and avoid the pain you created for them. \nYour job is to make it MORE PAINFUL NOT TO TAKE ACTION!!!<p>There are two ways to do this. (you should do both)\n1. Make the process as painless as possible.\n2. remind them and aggravate the pain that led them to your app in the first place.<p>Make sure your messaging not only hits on the emotional triggers at play and focuses on the benefits, not the features... (People buy the hole, not the drill)\nbut more importantly gives them the tools to defend their action to their friends and everyone else who they need to defend the decision to. \n------------<p>You should read Napoleon Hill's book ""Think and Grow Rich,"" if you read it carefully, you will see it is literally a bible of understanding human nature and the world, etc...<p>Here is a slightly relevant excerpt and list from the book, ""The 10 Mind Stimuli. The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are:<p>1. The Desire For Sex Expression\n2. Love\n3. A Burning Desire for fame, power, financial gain, money...\n4. Music\n5. Friendship between either those of the same sex or those of the opposite sex.\n6. A Master Mind Alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement.\n7. Mutual Suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted.\n8. Autosuggestion\n9. Fear\n10. Narcotics and Alcohol.<p>I hope this helps... Good Luck!",1331607020

(It's worth debating just what is ""seriously draconian"", though). We basically can't stop people from engaging in ludicrously profitable or enjoyable illegal activities, and at a micro level we can't stop dedicated individuals who want to hurt other individuals.<p>Given these two beliefs, I think your best bet is to shrink the organizations involved by drastically eliminating their profit margins on their most lucrative trade.

People who make movies still get paid.<p>Why? How? This is something important worth asking. At this point only the most simplistic of viewpoints could possibly imagine a future where it is impossible for people to earn a living through making art. There are far, far too many counter examples, even of artists going out of their way to challenge the traditional assumptions and pioneer new methods for making money by creating art (Louis CK, Radiohead, Humble Bundle, Double Fine, Julia Nunes, etc.)<p>Unquestionably the changes in technology that have enabled unfettered sharing/piracy of digital goods will have a profound effect on the financial nature of commercial art.<p>But will that effect translate to a situation other than a metric crapton of art being produced every year and a great many artists making a living off of their work?<p>Absolutely, conclusively not.",1331605684

That would be <i>horrible</i>.",1331604901

Fuck it, i'll answer it anyway.<p>First.<p>Evil by definition is:<p><pre><code>  6. that which is evil; evil quality, intention, or conduct: to choose the lesser of two evils.\n  7. the force in nature that governs and gives rise to wickedness and sin.\n  8. the wicked or immoral part of someone or something: The evil in his nature has destroyed the good.\n  9. harm; mischief; misfortune: to wish one evil.\n  10. anything causing injury or harm: Tobacco is considered by some to be an evil. \n</code></pre>\n(<a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/evil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/evil</a>)<p>Therefore, if you want to 'do evil' you can harm, cause mischief, cause misfortune, cause injury or harm, etc etc etc. So that's what ""you can do evil"" means.<p>Second.<p>Evil is not by definition, ""doing something you shouldn't do,"" as evidenced in the definition in the URL linked above. Evil is just bad. Sometimes it might be necessary to do evil. The bible has innocent god-fearing people do evil all the god-damn time - but it's something they do In The Name Of The Lord.<p>Third.<p>Why the hell are you telling me this? I never said anyone should or should not 'ban evil', I was merely stating that the potential for good or evil in a public domain-licensed piece of software like SQLite can't be compared to an Open Source-licensed product because the public domain is inherently more evil than Open Source.<p>Fourth.<p>'Banning evil' is not even comparable, to saying that breaking a law is illegal. Saying that breaking a law is illegal is a truism. Banning evil is a sometimes-necessary act in order to enforce a punishment for doing evil, which is the whole basis for a system of laws and penalties. You have to define what evil is and define a punishment for varying degrees of evil. Without specifically defining such laws you have a kind of tribal unspoken law which is quite subjective and not compatible with things like copyright law or software licenses.<p>Does that clear things up?",1331604272

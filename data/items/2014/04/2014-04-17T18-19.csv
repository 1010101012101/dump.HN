It&#x27;s truly a shame that the vast majority of the American population have been and will be deprived of a childhood that includes a chance to walk to school, take the train to a museum, and play with other kids in the neighborhood.<p>Suburbs also play a central role in making car ownership absolutely necessary in order to perform even the most basic daily tasks. This, if you think about, amounts to discrimination against the elderly, children, and anyone who is not able to drive or afford a car.",1397761193

I show that, within a quantum mechanical\n    framework, all phenomena which leave a trail of\n    information behind (and hence can be studied by\n    physics) are those where entropy necessarily increases\n    or remains constant. All phenomena where the entropy\n    decreases must not leave any information of their\n    having happened. This situation is completely\n    indistinguishable from their not having happened at\n    all. In the light of this observation, the second law\n    of thermodynamics is reduced to a mere tautology:\n    physics cannot study those processes where entropy has\n    decreased, even if they were commonplace.\n</code></pre>\nPhys.

7605560,comment,7604961,7605350,1,0,specialp,,,"I think this is a change in the New York area mostly.  Back in the 70s-mid 80s NYC was a much more dangerous place and living in the suburbs was cheap.  Young people in the city then moved to the suburbs to escape rents and high crime.  However now the suburbs like Westchester, Long Island have become very expensive with very high taxes.<p>Since these suburbs are comparatively wealthy the citizens fight against high density development.  So if you are a young person that grew up on Long Island you have the choice of paying $1400 to live in someone&#x27;s illegal basement apartment, living in one of the few decent complexes for $2000+ or move to NYC.  It is easy to see why moving to NYC is very attractive then.  When you are single or a couple it is good to live in the city as there are plentiful jobs and entertainment options.<p>So I think that there is not a massive landslide of people leaving the suburbs I think it is just that people are having children much later, the city is now safe, and there are no cheap options for singles/childless couples in the suburbs in the NYC metro area.  People still move from NYC to the suburbs.  And in cheaper metro areas the suburbs are growing very fast because they are much like the situation that existed in NYC in the 70s-mid 80s",1397760742

I grew up in the Northeast and now live in a smaller city in the West (pop ~250,000). I can get to SF in a few hours, but locally I still have most of the things I&#x27;d want from a city: great restaurants, art, fun tech community, music, easy to access airport etc. I also have many of the perks of living in a smaller community: very little traffic, incredibly affordable cost of living, get to know the owners of most restaurants/businesses I frequent etc.<p>The crazy thing is that living in a house 10 minutes from the center of downtown I pay a fraction of what my friends and relatives back East do to live in a suburb so far away from the metro area they live near that they visit it only once or twice a year.<p>Especially with more and more remote work becoming available, if you&#x27;re getting sick of living in a major metro area I highly recommend checking the diverse range of smaller cities across the US, imho it is a vastly superior experience to living in an expensive suburb.",1397760608

IMO you should hire someone to build your website, or just buy a theme for $50. (themeforest.com)<p>I originally moved to NYC to do essentially the same thing you&#x27;re doing.  I gave it up and started coding after banging my head against the wall working with founders/product/marketing teams that could talk all day about funnels, optimizations and product flaws but at the end of the day werent capable of actually doing anything about it.  I know that the field is not so much competitive as it is brutal in that 85% of your job is convincing the client that they need you when they really dont.  They don&#x27;t need you to survive. However... if you&#x27;re good, they could make a significant return on their investment in you.  That is what your selling.<p>They do not need you, but without you... they&#x27;re leaving money on the table.<p>One thing I noticed is that 9/10 of my clients were product oriented people.  What this means (IMO) is that you&#x27;re website should look great.  When your clientele is the demographic that makes up HN, than you can skimp on design and get away with a truly phenomenal product.  A great example here is Tarsnap.<p>I would look into ghost.io and wordpress, among many others.<p>Also I think you need to make sure that you put your best work into your own brand.  You could do so much more to make a better direct connection between your home page and your blog.  Right now they appear to me to be 2 separate entities, and initially I thought they were 2 separate domains.  Also you should have a bigger social presence front and center on your website. You do a great job of getting these damn posts on the front of HN but you yourself arent capitalizing on the traffic.<p>Anyway... This is getting really long but goodluck!

For simple architectures, this may just be a hardcoded localhost:11211.<p>As you scale, it becomes prudent to distribute services across different servers. Your configuration could then become something like &quot;server1.mycompany.com:11211&quot;. But what if memcached moves from server1 to server2? You&#x27;ll need to reconfigure and restart your application.<p>More sophisticated apps will often use a dynamic approach: services are registered with something like ZooKeeper or etcd. When serviceA needs to talk to serviceB, serviceA looks up serviceB&#x27;s address in the service registry (or a local cache) and makes the request.<p>The good news is that these often include basic health check functionality, so you get a bit of fault tolerance for free. Unfortunately, this requires services to integrate directly with ZooKeeper or etcd, adding undesired complexity.<p>Some architectures therefore choose to use DNS as their service registry. But instead of hardcoding a the DNS address of a single node (like &quot;server1.mycompany.com&quot;), they hit an address associated with the service (serviceB.mycompany.com). This usually means rolling your own system to keep DNS up to date (adding/pruning in context of health state).<p>Consul is a hybrid approach. It allows you to use DNS as a service registry, but operates as its own, distributed DNS server cluster. Think of it like a specialized ZooKeeper cluster that exposes service information via DNS (and HTTP, if you prefer).<p>Back to the memcached case. With Consul, you&#x27;d point your app at &quot;memcached.consul:11211&quot;. If your memcached server fell over and was replaced, Consul would pick up the change and return the new address.

Sure, it&#x27;s possible, it will work just fine; but... it&#x27;s just wrong.<p>By the way, the existence of the #&#x27;values function by no means implies there&#x27;s some data structure being created; indeed, that&#x27;s the whole point of the #&#x27;values construct. Anything you could do with #&#x27;values you could do in a list which you then destructured; #&#x27;values is to be used when the common-case is to throw away the &quot;structure&quot; and just use each value individually or not at all, like with the return values of #&#x27;floor. So in fact #&#x27;values is exactly what you want; I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s a &quot;hack&quot; when lisp programmers write it under one name and &quot;the solution&quot; when you write it under a different name.<p>Ah, it occurs to me that maybe racket doesn&#x27;t work like this, but in common lisp at least, the transiency of values can be seen in that when you say, e.g., (+ (floor a b) c), the remainder of a/b is thrown away; just the first value is used. That&#x27;s another huge benefit over structures-to-be-destructured, but obviously doesn&#x27;t work if the extra values are always important.<p>The point of my discussion with Maybe is that /even if/ it&#x27;s just a nullable pointer, conceptually it&#x27;s essentially a [restricted] tuple. (pointer-is-null,data). There&#x27;s still two pieces of data there, even if the representation of one of them is cleverly folded into generic object representation or what-have-you. By definition it can&#x27;t be done with a single piece of data: (Maybe a) is not the same type as (a), for all a. Even if (Maybe Word16), e.g., were represented in a single value at a single place in memory, that value would have to hold more than 16 bits.

(New Google engineers can also just move to the glass apartments straight away for an approximately-equivalent effect). This isn&#x27;t that hard to reason about, honestly.<p>You ARE probably right about the place they leave charging higher rent than it used to be. On the other hand, you&#x27;re a fool if you think that the sweetheart deal that the established Google engineer enjoys (almost certainly as a result of city rental ordinances) will be an ounce of comfort or of any material benefit to the next person who needs to find an apartment, engineer or no.

Any time you need to reprocess a filter you&#x27;ve got to run it through a series of imperative actions triggered from one of the events, and possibly throw away the collection and regenerate it (if you can&#x27;t remove disjoint filters).<p>I would be pushing for a Object.observe/dirty checking/get-set version of this to take PourOver to the next level of utility.

It excludes accidents, homicides, and\n   other causes indirectly related to drug use. Also excluded are\n   newborn deaths due to mother’s drug use. (For drug-induced causes,\n   see Technical notes.) Between 1997 and 1998 the age-adjusted death\n   rate for drug-induced causes increased 5 percent from 5.6 deaths per\n   100,000 U.S. standard population to 5.9, the highest it has been since\n   at least 1979.\n</code></pre>\nAnd doing a little searching for number of deaths from prescribed medications:<p><pre><code>    In 2010, there were 38,329 drug overdose deaths in the United States; \n    most (22 134; 57.7%) involved pharmaceuticals; 9429 (24.6%) involved \n    only unspecified drugs. Of the pharmaceutical-related overdose deaths, 16,451 \n    (74.3%) were unintentional, 3780 (17.1%) were suicides, and 1868 (8.4%) \n    were of undetermined intent.

7605181,comment,7602876,7604238,2,0,bedhead,,,"Here&#x27;s my theory on it. The main problem is that companies only use one method for determining pay: comps. That&#x27;s it. They just look around at peer companies and pick a number that&#x27;s average or higher. It&#x27;s a perpetual arms race with things only moving in one direction. One guy gets a raise? Effectively everyone does, too, because the median/mean just went up. After 30 years, the compounding effect of this becomes unimaginable.<p>But that&#x27;s only half the problem, the other half is that using comps with respect the executive pay is <i>boundless</i> in practice. Think of it compared to housing prices. Home prices rely heavily on comps to help determine the market, but real prices can only go so high because there&#x27;s only so much debt burden buyers can accept. Prices are effectively capped (in the short-run) by income. This is not the case with companies, particularly bigger, stable companies that are more-or-less on autopilot. Technically, the &quot;market can bear&quot; paying the management billions since these companies are large and profitable. It&#x27;s just a skimming operation.<p>What we have now is people, oftentimes interchangeable and generic people (and sometimes even downright morons) making unspendable fortunes for simply showing up to work. Someone else built this thing. Other investors provided the capital. And somehow, you get Fuck-You money. There&#x27;s no incentive alignment anymore.",1397757626

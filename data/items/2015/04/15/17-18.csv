9382818,comment,9381524,9382335,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,">there have been cultural protectionist barriers set up to protect the most bountiful activities.<p>How is tech bountiful for men and why would men keep anyone out of it? My female friends all went to medical or law school or got a fancy post-graduate degree and used their prestigious bonafides to go straight into a high paying career. They make more money than me and anyone I know in tech.<p>The realty is that tech kinda sucks for everyone but a handful of personality types. If you&#x27;re overly social, outgoing, not detail obsessed, not interested in puzzles, etc then you wont like it.<p>I think the gender argument is bunk. There&#x27;s more division intra-gender than inter-gender. Instead we should focus on personality types, but frankly, I don&#x27;t think society is mature enough for a rational discussion of this topic. Outrage and gender politics rules the social media roost and in the future people will look back at this time and think us all morons; and rightfully so.",1429120759

Your ratio drops precipitously and you start hiring women again at a higher rate.

Waze does have some degree of ads, but going out on a limb, I would venture to guess they are pretty negligible.  Others may argue that Waze has all this valuable crowd sourced traffic data, well I don&#x27;t think that data has been or will be monetized either.  So what is the value of Waze that justifies a >$1B acquisition? In my estimation, it is the same thing as Foursquare (if not now, at one point should have had), due to their user base and the nature of the app, by default both Waze and Foursquare are <i>cartographers</i> and there is real money/value in that, and I am surprised of >100 comments I didn&#x27;t see one mentioning that.<p>Because of the cost involved, there are only a handful of true map makers in the World, and from what I can tell they are all Billion dollar + companies.

AFAICT, its <i>inspired</i> by the transitive use, which is an odd (from the point of view of the meanings of the individual words in modern English) translation of a Latin phrase into English, and -- unlike the intransitive use -- actually uses the individual words in something like their usual definitions. It also provides a convenient rationalization of the older intransitive use as a specialization of the transitive use where the question for which an answer is demanded is that of the support for the premise under discussion, so that the transitive use turns the intransitive use from an idiom that is detached from the meanings of the words in the language outside of the idiom to one connected to it in a clear way.<p>Accepting the transitive use, which is widely established and whose meaning is immediately clear to anyone who encounters it and which is completely unambiguously differentiated from the intransitive use, does nothing but make life better for everyone.<p>Opposing it isn&#x27;t merely pedantry, its pedantry that ignores clear grammatical distinctions and seeks to find confusion where there is none to be found.",1429119522

9382548,comment,9380635,9381421,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Well, let me back up from that and make this analogy. In a perfect world, there&#x27;d be no need for police because there&#x27;d be no criminals. There are good cops and bad cops but we can all agree that, in a perfect world, the job wouldn&#x27;t need to exist.<p>In practice, police can&#x27;t do the job so well that they&#x27;re no longer needed because the world is so big. There are always new criminals, and there are many sources of crime, and that&#x27;s not the cops&#x27; fault.<p>With management, whether that is true depends on the size and competency of the organization. With a small team, a good manager can get everyone aligned and then step back. With hundreds of people, maybe not. There will always be conflicts to resolve and problem employees to watch.<p>A manager&#x27;s job is &quot;protect, direct, eject&quot;. The strong employees need to be steered away from and shielded from (&quot;protect&quot;) the political messes that earnest high performers often fall into, and from the resentment that being good at their jobs (and being rewarded for it) may attract. They also need to be able to take risks and spread their wings. The average ones need to be kept on track (&quot;direct&quot;), and the incorrigible problem employees need to be fired (&quot;eject&quot;).<p>If you do the job well, you won&#x27;t have many problem employees (the &quot;eject&quot; category) because the corrigible or previously-unlucky ones you can fix, and the rare incorrigible ones you should fire. The mediocre employees (the &quot;direct&quot; category) will be mentored until they&#x27;re good, and therefore in to the &quot;protect&quot; category, as well. So two of the three jobs (direct and eject) are finite and temporary (except for when the team acquires more people). As for &quot;protect&quot;, who do high-talent employees need to be protected from? Executives and other managers; basically, anyone else who can hurt them. So, yes, in an ideal world there wouldn&#x27;t be the &quot;manager&quot; job. In practice, it&#x27;s different and you actually need them.<p>Too many managers fall in love with the &quot;direct&quot; part of the job. They like telling people what to do. They ignore the &quot;protect&quot; part of it (because it can put them at personal risk, and because it&#x27;s hard to do) and no one (except for a psychopath) enjoys the &quot;eject&quot; aspect. They get good at that one aspect and develop an approach that works reasonably well for middle-of-the-road employees but (a) doesn&#x27;t handle the extremes, and (b) doesn&#x27;t really allow for growth or progress (as in Scrum, where there&#x27;s no allowance that one might graduate out of having to justify small amounts of one&#x27;s own working time).",1429118658

Examining Google&#x27;s launch report for a 2008 algorithm change, FTC staff said that Google elected to show its product search OneBox &quot;regardless of the quality&quot; of that result (footnote 119, citing GOOGLR-00330279-80) and despite &quot;pretty terribly embarrassing failures&quot; in returning low-quality results (footnote 170, citing GOOGWRIG-000041022). Indeed, Google&#x27;s product search service apparently failed Google&#x27;s standard criteria for being indexed by Google search (p.80 and footnote 461), yet Google nonetheless put the service in top positions (p.30 and footnote 170, citing GOOG-Texas-0199877-906).&#x27;<p><a href=""http://www.benedelman.org/news/040115-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.benedelman.org/news/040115-1.html</a><p>Were consumers hurt if Google de-ranked content which by even Google&#x27;s own standards were better than its own?

What books have specifically changed your mind, behavior, attitude, etc?<p>Some examples for myself:<p>Daring Greatly by Brene Brown - Shame is not a good motivator, it does more damage than good in the long run. It’s currently my goal to never use shame on people again.<p>The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg - One of the most empowering books I’ve ever read. We are creatures of habit and any habit can be altered. We don’t have to put up with bad behaviors and routines, they can be changed. I now constantly think about the habits behind my actions and how I can alter the ones I want to change.<p>Mindset by Carol Dweck - Any skill can be learned and we are not limited to what we’re born with. When facing difficulty with a new task, rather than shrinking away and saying “I guess I just can’t figure this out”, I instead know that I can learn it, but it may require more effort on my part.",1429117719

At that point doesn&#x27;t it end up in the same distribution as the regular matter? And isn&#x27;t it then just unaccounted for? And wouldn&#x27;t it have zero effect on the shape of the rotation curve?<p>I&#x27;ve seen reports of &quot;fixing&quot; the problem by assuming a galaxy is enclosed in spherical ball of dark matter. But of course no explanation of why it would maintain that shape. In other words, the model of dark matter isn&#x27;t even complete. In some cases I&#x27;ve seen people misapply the divergence theorem as well.<p>It would not be the first time people used a hack to &quot;fix&quot; what ultimately boils down to numerical problems or inadequate integration methods.<p>Somewhere down my bucket list is to do galaxy simulation. So far all I&#x27;ve done is plot rotation curves that don&#x27;t look like keplers laws, but no dynamic simulation yet.",1429117264

The question is whether they provide all the information they&#x27;ve collected first, and calculate the results based on that, and provide it to the taxpayer who can either accept it or note any changes/additional information and return it, or they make the taxpayer do it first from scratch (or pay someone else to do it, or pay for a tool to do it), and then the IRS goes and does it in anyway for every taxpayer taking into account the information they have from the taxpayer and what they have received separately.<p>In either case, the IRS is <i>absolutely</i> going to calculate how much people owe. That&#x27;s not even the <i>choice</i> that is at issue. So the objection to <i>one side</i> of that choice that the IRS calculating how much people owe is a &quot;conflict of interest&quot; is a non-sequitur; it simply has no bearing on the choice.",1429117236

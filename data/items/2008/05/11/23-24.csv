187120,comment,187042,187042,0,0,dshah,,,"The big challenge with the freemium model is that there needs to be enough of a separation between what is ""free"" and what is ""premium"".  If the free version contains too much, people don't have enough of a cause to upgrade to premium.  Too little, and not enough people use the free version.<p>As for simply charging for uptime, the issue is kind of a ""tragedy of the commons"".  If everyone is benefiting from the increased uptime, the folks paying the premium don't really have an incentive to pay.<p>Finally, one of the big challenges of Twitter is that even getting folks to use the free version is non-trivial.",1210549445

I thought your statement tended to agree with the original one but maybe that isn't the case.

Not that I don't like supporting sites that I love, but we shouldn't even have to think about paying for something like this.<p>If I were to pay for a service, I would want features that would better my experience with the service, not ensuring that it would have a longer uptime.

187104,comment,186911,186955,0,0,martian,,,"Having seen the widespread use of Dell in some larger corporate accounts, I feel bad for the employees who are forced to use such terrible machines with such terrible service. Plastic parts and poor design lead to machines that feel flimsy and break often.<p>With service contracts outsourced to Bangalore (or other off-shore or off-site locations), users of Dell equipment at these corporations are becoming more and more flustered. They can't get their machines fixed in a timely manner, and are locked in to long-term contracts negotiated by executive board members who don't use the machines on a daily basis.<p>When you say that Dell makes ""cheap functional machines"", I'd argue that they're simply in the business of making cheap machines these days. Functional machines, I'd argue, would be able to withstand the rigors of normal (10hr/day) usage.<p>One of the mains reason Apple succeeds today is because their equipment works. Lenovo is also succeeding, despite its ties with Microsoft. (Also, it doesn't hurt that Apple has stores all over the country where you can get live, in-person help with your machine.)",1210547758

9189844,comment,9189553,9189696,0,0,marktangotango,,,"I think this observation highlights the problem with Linear Algebra, the applications aren&#x27;t encountered until upper level courses in other fields, and then they teach what you need to know for the course.<p>I took two semesters of Linear Algebra in college, the first course was an overview for physicists and engineers and was little more than the mechanics of matrix operations, and find eigen vectors and eigen values. The second course focused on Linear Algebra as an abstract algebra, with near zero application.  Subsequently, reading this paper[1] and the way the author used Linear Algebra blew my mind, why wasn&#x27;t I taught about THAT kind of Linear Algebra?<p>I suppose my examples illustrates: great teach Linear Algebra, but what facets to concentrate on?

9189827,comment,9178765,9188011,0,0,lmm,,,"> As a browser-embedded scripting engine, don&#x27;t-break-the-web selection pressure would have forked and stunted early Python or any other language about as badly as JS, ignoring the spurious (to what I wrote) &quot;Blub was a better language to start from&quot; benefit.<p>All (successful) languages ossify sooner or later - just look at how long promised Java improvements are taking to arrive. Python 3.4 is recognizably the same language as Python 1.3, and still suited for much the same problems; it&#x27;s never going to be Perl or OCaml, even with that ability to make backwards-incompatible changes that JS doesn&#x27;t have. Where you start from matters.<p>> Netscape management insisted on &quot;make it look like Java&quot;, and time pressure combined with &quot;don&#x27;t be too big a sidekick&quot; angst from Sun kept such things as classes out of JS in the early days (it took till ES6 to add classes).<p>Exactly! A language that was designed to not be a replacement for Java for serious, large-scale programming programming, turns out to... not be a replacement for Java for serious, large-scale programming, surprise. No-one is denying (I hope) that JS is a very good language within the constraints it was designed for. But today&#x27;s use cases are very different from making the monkey dance; the things we&#x27;re writing in JS today are much closer to the things we were writing in Java 10 years ago than they are to the things we were writing in JS 10 years ago.<p>JS&#x27;s unsuitability for certain problems is a result of design decisions, not any &quot;stagnation&quot;; no amount of active development (as welcome as it is) is going to make language X into language Y, and no language can be all things to all people. With the browser becoming more and more of an OS, requiring all web programs to be written in the same language is as wrong as requiring all non-web programs to be written in the same language.<p>> How about you write the patch and submit it, with tests, and then talk to Mozilla or any other open source browser project.<p>Wait, Mozilla would accept my patches? Of course Mozilla should allocate their own engineering effort as they see fit (we may disagree about specifics). But my understanding, and the part I took issue with, was that Mozilla was refusing to ever embed Dart as a matter of policy.",1426153804

9189824,comment,9189096,9189762,0,0,peterfirefly,,,"By the computer in the keyboard.  It always was on the PC.<p>The keyboard is supposed to send properly debounced MAKE/BREAK codes.  It also handles autorepeat and knows that some keys are shift keys and lock keys.<p>It even handles the consequences of new developments and backwards compatibility: the extra ctrl and alt keys couldn&#x27;t get new keycodes because then existing programs wouldn&#x27;t recognize them.  The solution was to send a special code before MAKE/BREAK of right ctrl/alt.<p>And it gets worse: there wasn&#x27;t a separate set of keys for arrows/PgUp/PgDn/Home/End/Ins/Del at first.  All we had was the numeric keypad.  Whether you got numbers or arrows depended on the xor of num lock and the shift key.  So the arrow keys actually share their keycode with the numbers on the numeric keypad!  Again the solution involved a special code being sent: before an entirely fake MAKE for one of the shift keys followed by the keycode for one of the numeric keypad keys (MAKE or BREAK), followed by the special code and a fake BREAK for the shift key.  And of course, whether you get the synthesized shift key events depends on whether you already have a shift key pressed and on the Num lock status.  You can get them for either of the keys sharing the keycode.<p>Entirely new keys were a lot easier (F11, F12): they just got a new keycode.",1426153763

9189750,comment,9188920,9189748,0,0,lazyseq,,,"I really also have to question the attitude of the founders. I found a lot of the quotes out there about this product insulting. &quot;Building the backend, however, is like stacking wine glasses: it’s not that hard, but if you make a mistake it’s a bigger issue to deal with.&quot; If building a back-end is not hard, then why do I need your product? It should just be easy as long as I test it and do a lot of checking to make sure the wine glasses don&#x27;t fall. What makes me think that the founders of all people are the ones I should trust to make these decisions when the pitch for the product is insulting the people who actually build solid back-ends? I&#x27;ve built a lot of back-ends that people actually use and not once has it been an easy task. Even the jobs that took me less than a day I would never say were easy; perhaps I simply discovered humility and actually lived long enough to see what happens to systems 10+ years after they are used by real people.<p>I would also apply the above to front-ends - they are never just &quot;easy.&quot; But front-ends you can mess up and fix them without too much catastrophe beyond perhaps annoyed/lost users/etc. When back-ends fail or are designed badly, we lose data, ability to gain insight into our business, can&#x27;t satisfy company/client requirements, and so on. These are much more serious consequences than your app not being responsive or shiny, or looking like it came from a wannabe Craigslist fan. Both are important to success, but let&#x27;s not pretend that our apps could be the next Google if we could only sweep away that pesky back-end. It seems on some level the founders agree here that back-ends going wrong are really a problem, but why does this start-up suddenly guarantee success here? Just the fact of using node.js + <insert db> does not make a back-end good. Using things the community generates also does not make something good. Back-ends are anything but one size fits all, or even one size fits more than a few people.<p>Producing a good back-end is actually very hard for anything beyond a prototype and an often misunderstood art form. I don&#x27;t get this notion I see a lot that xyz programmer is a &quot;front-end&quot; developer and abc programmer is a &quot;back-end&quot; developer. You are not a developer at all if you can&#x27;t learn anything you put the time and effort into I would argue. At best, you are a beginning programmer who knows a few libraries that are focused on one or more aspects of a system. In practice, you don&#x27;t always get to work in jobs in all roles, but you still have to know about all of them to be an effective developer. I would never hire someone for my team beyond a junior-level that was not strong in all areas. There are of course specialists as well, but these are more for things like crypto/security, embedded programming, and so-on rather than your general application code. Simply put, if you can&#x27;t learn front or back-end development to meet the requirements of your development tasks, you have no business doing them. As a corollary, it is important to know your strengths and hand-off to people who might be more artistic or more familiar with a language, but it does not absolve you of learning about the other parts of your system. So I also ask, what part of this protects a programmer who is inexperienced, clueless, or otherwise too busy to care about the back-end to not structure or combine otherwise solid parts (for the sake of argument) of this tool from creating a back-end that is a complete disaster because of the sum of its parts?<p>I think this app discounts the close relationship of a system as a whole between the front and back-end. A few things were mentioned already like syncing data offline, but I have additional concerns. Note for example that caching, data modeling, and asynchronous programming for example are all very closely related to both databases/working with data and building user interfaces. I cannot tell you how many times I have had to build little tricks to makeup for technology or real-world issues that involved doing things like encoding some bits of information in a database key, field, whatever to make something more cacheable, O(1) lookup, or whatever to ensure the front-end experience was better, or even just deal with deficiencies from other parts of the code. I think the notion of all parts of the system needing to work with a consistent approach, philosophy, and quality is highly demonstrated by the current approaches in Clojure using ClojureScript, React, and Datomic for example where the notion of using immutable data makes it both easier to cache information nearly indefinitely, and to create UI that renders quickly due to the ability to use deltas and caching as bi-products of immutable data. There are many other systems and frameworks that share this view of &quot;turtles all the way down.&quot;<p>Another problem with the product here is I don&#x27;t see a good story of how someone can legitimately develop a solid back-end with this tool. The problem is not necessarily the tooling, but the customer that presumably uses this already lacks the skills to create a back-end. What about the product being visual suddenly mitigates this? It seems from the literature available that the implication is that a lot of back-ends are super simple and require merely basic CRUD operations. In my experience, this is anything but for most people. Business users for better or worse like to throw tons of rules, conditionals, corner cases, and so-on when developing a system. It is your responsibility if you are a developer to stop this, but I hardly think the customer here is one of those people who knows enough to do this correctly or at all. The tool looks like it can give you the ability to add all these rules to be something more than super simple CRUD, but the problem is not the rules working or not, but the fact that adding them and using them usually causes countless bugs and severe consequences without someone who knows what they are doing actually checking with proper thought. Assuming you are building a CRUD app with none of the aforementioned complexity, I hardly see why someone would not just use something that is either stupidly simple or closely matches their domain to do this like Salesforce, Sugar CRM, Excel, whatever. This product seems to give no immediate value proposition over a naive CRUD app over existing tools, and takes away just enough power to not make it something that can compete with a more complicated solution like existing web or app frameworks.<p>Additionally, I have encountered the truth is that there are few things in an application that matter more than data. One could argue the end-user functionality is king and while this is often true, you can still get away with not the greatest user experience and product but be successful. Judging the front-end is very subjective at times, but the back-end is rarely anything but subjective. I have seen countless front-ends that made millions for companies based on nothing more than Access, Excel, FoxPro, VB, Salesforce, Drupal, Wordpress, whatever. One thing they would all tell you though is their data (and even logic) was super important to them. Another reality is a lot of these people already have the data in abc form and need to transform it to xyz form(s) to take the next step. This solution does not seem to have any obvious story here. That seems to discount a lot of people with existing businesses and products. Doing ETL or any sort of transformations is exceedingly complex, and the person using this tool would hardly be the person to do it. I just can&#x27;t imagine everyone else doing the heavy lifting of getting existing data into a form to use with this tool, then stop the heavy lifting to use an unknown quantity in an online visual builder.<p>I have many more concerns and arguments here, but to cut a long rant slightly shorter, putting everything else I said aside, what about the tree structure itself? Trees in web browsers seem like an awful fit. They are even a particularly awful fit in desktop UI beyond a few levels. Programming &quot;back-ends&quot; is notorious for deeply nested logic and complicated flows. I don&#x27;t see how modeling this in a tree is a good fit. A DAG is a bit better, but my real issue here is that it is so visually literal. I can already imagine being driven crazy with identation. Undoubtedly I am sure there is some work-around, solution, whatever just like in normal programming of hiding the nesting complexity by naming sub-trees, collapsing things, etc in the way we collapse things into files, classes, objects, namespaces, etc. This though seems to work a lot better in a text editor with some visual capabilities rather than in a purely visual editor. I&#x27;ve seen structural editors with Lisp that try to do fun things here too, but that&#x27;s another topic. Anyway, my point is that the UI itself seems like it won&#x27;t scale well and introduce complexity in groking the code it is supposed to simplify.<p>Generally, the problem with this product and most in the same space is that as you take away control from what someone can do here, you get diminishing returns. The reason some things work with bad back-ends is because they are super simple. This looks anything but simple and I have no nice way of saying this, but it seems targeted at an odd group. Are you going after high school - early 20 year olds beginning programming? If so, did it occur to you that these people are often fickle with spending money in this area, and often don&#x27;t have the money anyway? Who is your real customer beyond what is mentioned in the article. Sorry, but I don&#x27;t see a future for this tool and I can&#x27;t see why any logical person would invest the time and money to couple themselves to it. Shame on YC for investing in this one as well, you&#x27;ve been duped I think.",1426152238

Additionally I find the founders insulting and naive in the article.<p>I still don&#x27;t get who is the current and future customer even after reading the other posts here and other available material. I fail to see line of business users writing anything in this as it is too complicated for them and too close to programming. I cannot see an experienced dev introducing this in a stack and investing the time in learning the tool/libraries, building a system visually (super slow), and tying themselves to a 3rd party unknown start-up this tightly.  As for the indie developers mentioned in the article who cannot build a scalable back-end, who are these people? Why are they developing apps? Maybe I am a grouching aging developer, but I really don&#x27;t understand who these people are - &quot;Indie developers comfortable building the user-facing side of an app themselves, but who would need assistance to build out a scalable backend.&quot;<p>I would argue that if you believe you are a person who builds apps, you should be capable of actually building the app you are building. Beyond that, you are just another person with an idea, which in our world means absolutely nothing. While I can see how people can build a prototype not knowing exactly what they are doing and become successful, the keyword here is prototype. A prototype doesn&#x27;t usually need to be scalable. If you want and need scalability, you need to build something carefully which matches your app&#x27;s use cases and real-world usage. This is a difficult problem and not one that can be solved by plugging in anything and waiving a wand.<p>Listen, I&#x27;ve worked as a developer since the late 80s, consultant since the 90s, spent many years at Microsoft, and worked for a few startups. I suppose I am one of those weird people who doesn&#x27;t care about the tools, language, whatever, just give me the task and I will find the best tools to do it, and learn them in hours if I must to get the job done so I am open to anything to help, but this app makes me feel like I live in the Twilight Zone. I have seen this exact product in some shape or form so many times whether it was Visual XXX or ABC Builder or even some layer on a product like SharePoint, Dynamics CRM, Wordpress, whatever. The closest tools that have had at least practical success I&#x27;ve seen have been Excel and Hypercard. My hats off to you if you can make it work, but really I have my doubts. There is nothing written so far that is convincing me or more importantly, that would convince any of my previous customers (including private, government, and start-ups) to use this. And I assure you that my past customers would like nothing more than to take shortcuts, not pay for my hours, and/or find some way to in-house many development tasks. There are just so many things wrong here I don&#x27;t know where to start. I&#x27;m not saying this to be mean, but rather I am genuinely curious who would use this and why. On top of this, you have tons of related competition, and hype around everything from Wolfram Language to Eden in this space if we broaden the scope to visual builders in general.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit telling that one of the first comments is, &quot;Treeline is different.&quot; I am pretty sure everyone who builds a product like this says exactly this, including my former colleagues who built real, very large, and even well-selling products. I have never seen any product genuinely succeed in its goal here, at best these products just sold the sucker&#x27;s line and did not retain their customers long-term. Alternatively, these products succeeded in something else, but failed in the &quot;app&quot; or &quot;back-end&quot; builder category.",1426152225

In Oregon, Stenn lives with his wife and does most of his patch inspection, code writing, and release building three weeks a month. The fourth week, he stays in San Jose, close to two co-location data center providers that host NTP computers. He rents a room there to work on server and network administration, maintain the email list, and check on server backups.<p>Much of the travel, room, replacement hardware such as disk drives, or needed commercial software such as the Coverity system for security checking on code, must come out of the $7,000 monthly stipend or be charged to his consulting business.<p>Most of his 17-20 servers came out of a one-time, $10,000 grant in 2010 from the Internet Society, a policy and technology infrastructure advisory body for the Internet founded in 1991. Those servers are running at ISC.org in Redwood City, Calif., which hosts BIND and several other open source pieces of Internet infrastructure. For 15 years, it has provided space, electricity and some management &quot;smart hands&quot; to host NTP operations, without charging, said Stenn. &quot;They would love for us to pay them,&quot; he said, and he once totaled the monthly bill at $1,400. But ISC.org also knows the NTP project can&#x27;t pay and continues to host it, Stenn added.&quot;<p>And on the first page:<p>&quot;Its ongoing development and maintenance now rest mostly on the shoulders of Stenn, and that&#x27;s why NTP faces a turning point.

The soviets would have treated them far worse.  However, according to the Japanese - it was the bomb that drove them to surrender.  Additionally, though the Soviets were right next door, the U.S. had Japan essentially blockaded and completely surrounded. We would never had allowed the Soviets to close in and conquer Japan; nor did the Soviets have the ability to mount an invasion of mainland Japan.  This blockade of Japan, and the fact that their forces in Asia were essentially cut-off, led to the weakening and thus capitulation of those Japanese forces when it came time for the Soviets to attack. The Soviets essentially attacked a weaken and already beaten Japanese army in Asia - a small feat, not a great decisive one.",1282053388

1611081,comment,1610700,1610804,0,0,raganwald,,,"This is a very complex question and there are no obviously correct answers. Here in Ontario, what you did outside of business hours is the business of a prospective employer in a certain sense. We have a law prohibiting certain forms of hiring discrimination, and as part of that it is illegal to ask a candidate questions pertaining to such things. So for example, I am not allowed to about your religious activities.<p>But I am allowed to ask questions that do not directly or indirectly adress illegal discrimination, and asking about profession-related activities is usually on-side.<p>That being said, it is perfectly legal for anyone to file a lawsuit suggesting that perfectly legal questions are being used to indirectly create illegal discriminatory practices. So if I never ask about religion but I only hire from my network which ""happens to be"" my church or my weekly Richard Dawkins Appreciation Society club...<p>What little I know about HR suggests that hiring out of a professional network that is agnostic about discriminatory matters is legal. HOWEVER, programming networks are on shaky ground. Not because of religion, but things like Ruby Conferences seem to under-represent certain protected classes of people like women.<p>Another example: If I put out a call for applicants on my own blog and that's the only source of applicants, am I discriminating against people who speak English competently for professional purposes but only read Hindi or Mandarin programming blogs? In ontario, that could be construed as illegal.<p>I can't give anyone legal advice, but if your network gives the appearance of discriminating against qualified candidates in protected classes, I suggest that it's good business sense to expand your network. It's a win-win: You'll get qualified people that other employers are ignoring, and your legal costs will go way down.<p>So... Good point about the title. And even though I am NOT saying that <i>in an interview</i> I refuse to hire someone who does not blog or go to conferences or tweet or whatever, my filtering mechanism could be breaking the law if it accidentally discriminates in a legal sense.",1282053037

If neither one of them could demonstrate such a thing, the one that seemed more intelligent.<p>Also, the difference between 10 years and 20 years of experience, I think, is less than the difference between, say, 5 years and 10 years... I think the wage curve would imply most people agree with me here.   In the case of someone with 2.5 years of personal experience and 2.5 years of professional experience, vs. 5 years of professional experience, if all else were equal (which is to say, either neither has completed a project they can show me, or they both have, and they seem about as smart, and they are willing to work for the same wage)  it's pretty much a toss-up in my mind.   If the guy with 5 years work seems more professional, I might go with him, just 'cause I lack professionalism, and it can be really useful sometimes.<p>But, the thing is, it's usually not equal.  the guy with 2.5 years paid experience and 2.5 years hobby experience, in my experience, is likely to work for only slightly more than someone with only 2.5 years of professional experience.<p>So, given the choice between hiring the person with 5 years paid experience at market rate for a person with 5 years paid experience, and the person with 2.5 years paid experience and 2.5 years hobby experience at the market rate for someone with 2.5 years of experience, I'll easily take the latter.

I'm sure P2P voice providers like Skype are very upset about this agreement. And customers should be, too. If my 3G/4G provider selectively blocks my voice calls they should state it very clearly on the marketing material. Something like ""X GB per month for everything but voice, peer-to-peer, and any other service that competes with our own services."" Of course they will never say that because they don't want the public to be aware they are being <i>deceived</i>.<p>Even for the rest of the corporations the wireless situation is very bad. They won't be able to have inexpensive communications over IP if it goes through wireless, like conference calls. They'll be forced to use oligopolistic and overpriced services for something already paid for.<p>This isn't bad just for end users and I think Torrentfreak missed the point. This proposal initiates a terrible false dichotomy of wired vs. wireless. It helps current use of peer-to-peer (the bait) crippling wireless (the real deal in the very near future.)

Retirement was a brass ring that was held up for workers to see as a way to keep them productive and loyal for a long period of time. Just think of how many times you've heard the phrase ""You don't want to jeopardize your pension do you?"" said in  a movie.<p>Unfortunately, greed, escalation, and bloat caught hold at lots of these companies. And the concept of company retirement became much more of a well organized ponzi scheme.<p>As one example, both of my parents were taught from an early age that they should grow up to work at one company for their entire life. And that's what they did. My mother, went to work for the local school system. And my father went to work for the local chemical production plant. When they started work they both expected a retirement package, payed into and provided solely by their employer.<p>Neither one got that. My mothers retirement plan converted. Into a 401k with a fractional matching contribution from the school district. So she went from 100% contribution from her employer, to 90% coming out of her paycheck. If she was to retire ""on time"".<p>My father had a much worse fate. He had a pension from his company and a company managed 401k. Both of which were gutted when the company was spun off in debt reallocation. He still has the company letters that shows him having over 1 Million dollars on paper as his retirement package. He retired with little more than a gold watch for 40 years on the job. I had to support him in the gap between his ""retirement"" and when his social security kicked in.<p>But the silver lining is that we can all learn from the fallacy of our predecessors. We can take responsibility for our own lives, happiness, and ""retirement"".

If I've got two people of the same age, one who has been programming only at work, and didn't start until college, vs. another person, who started (hobby) programming at 15, and does open-source projects on the weekend, well, the second person clearly has a whole lot more experience.<p>As an employer, the bonus is that usually salary is based on /paid/ experience... so even though the two people in the example above have a /huge/ difference in actual time spent programming, as an employer, their starting wage is going to be pretty similar.<p>So, twice as much experience, for the same money?  hell yes I'll choose the hobbyist.  and as far as I can tell, there is no law against that.

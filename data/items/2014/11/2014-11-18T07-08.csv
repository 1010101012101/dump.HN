8622884,comment,8619837,8622553,0,0,cromwellian,,,"There are couple of reasons to use GWT:<p>1) already attached to Java language and toolchain
2) code sharing with Server, Android, etc (see Google Inbox)
3) Optimized compiles (Closure can also do the same for JS)<p>Modern JIT JS engines do remove the need for most performance optimizations, but GWT and Closure Compiler have never really biased towards runtime performance, they have almost exclusively focused on code size.<p>GWT does do some optimizations that help with performance, but most web apps are not bottlenecked by raw Javascript performance. However for mobile apps in particular, especially those on slow networks all over the world, shipping smaller code will matter for latency, startup time, memory usage, etc.<p>Subjective perception of speed in web browsers is very often a function of DOM complexity, and excessive style recalc, layout, paint. You could reduce the JS execution to zero and still end up with an app that feels laggy as hell.<p>I don&#x27;t recommend people switch to GWT unless they have a reason to use Java. You can implement a lot of these optimizations on whatever language you like.<p>My philosophy is to use whatever you feel most comfortable in. I&#x27;m kind of tired of 2 decades of language wars in the tech community. I work on GWT because I used it for my own startup several years ago and needed to make patches to the project to improve it, and now I just like working on the compiler because it is an interesting problem space.<p>Personally, if I was writing non-Web apps, Rust looks to me like an exciting language. I&#x27;m more on the side of &quot;more typing&quot; as opposed to less (Go), and for non-Web apps, I like to work on games, and there, I want absolute best performance. Outside of C/C++, Rust looks to be the best new game in town (ok, I&#x27;ve heard good things about D). Swift, I don&#x27;t trust as being too proprietary and wedded to Objective-C semantics.<p>Now, I wonder who&#x27;s going to write a Rust-to-JS compiler? :)",1416297510

(What is this, Windows?) None of the third-party repos have a decent search function, either, so it&#x27;s difficult to tell whether they have the version I need.

(note that I got lost at the &quot;soft cut&quot; part, but did I get it right that &quot;choose ... else&quot; is closer to what I&#x27;d expect &quot;if .. else&quot; to do?)<p>Given that accessibility to people used to imperative languages is a core goal, I&#x27;m not sure that the choice of making &quot;else&quot; mean &quot;yeah whatever&quot; is the best one. Maybe it&#x27;s better to replace it by a different keyword entirely (&quot;if.. or..&quot; maybe). On a related note, just in case you&#x27;re not familiar with it, I believe that maybe the &quot;if.. fi&quot; construct in Dijkstra&#x27;s Guarded Command Language[0] is an easy way to get imperative-thinking people to embrace nondeterminism. It feels a lot like normal imperative &quot;if&quot;, except there is no &quot;else&quot;. If you want &quot;else&quot;, you need to add another guard explicitly, with the negation of your first guard. This way, it&#x27;s easy for people to grasp that the order of the guarded commands have no meaning. It also makes introducing nondeterminism very explicit.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language#Selection:_if"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language#Select...</a>",1416295800

It is solid, it is readable, it is fast. Python community is large, there&#x27;s a lot of very high quality tools written for it.

Regions found may turn out to be useless, so the goal is to find too many, rather than too few. That part is reasonably straightforward, and you can see how well it&#x27;s working visually.<p>Phase II is described in this paper:<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524v5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524v5.pdf</a><p>Each rectangular region is rescaled into a 277 x 277 pixel square.<p>Then they apply a convolutional neural network to each square:<p>&quot;We extract a 4096-dimensional feature vector from each region proposal using the Caffe implementation of the CNN described by Krizhevsky et al.  Features are computed by forward propagating a mean-subtracted RGB image through five convolutional layers and two fully connected layers.&quot;<p>So now they have a 4K vector of values for each region.  I thought CNNs had to be trained, but what would you train this against?  The 4K vector has no explicit meaning yet.<p>Phase III, in the same paper, uses a manually tagged training set and a support vector machine to try to train a model of those 4K feature vectors.  The output of this is a set of tags for each region, each with a probability.  This seems to be a straightforward machine learning system.<p>The new Stanford paper takes that data and, using training data from captioned images, turns those tags into sentences.

I would love to see language design go green by allowing easy optimizations that help us save both our valuable electricity and our time.<p>Are there design patterns that would allow us to more easily enable JIT for performance or even multithreading or GPU usage? V8, FTL and SpiderMonkey have all significantly sped up javascript performance making for much more efficient execution and better user experience. Python and PHP seem harder to adapt to JIT compilers as Facebook keeps working on HHVM for PHP and JITs for Python like PyPy lots of compatibility issues with existing libraries.<p>p.s. I for one really appreciate the entertainment value of exaggerated and opinionated style as long as the author realizes it is partly for entertainment, calls it out in the title and clearly isn&#x27;t taking themselves too seriously.

Hasselblads were used for a long time in the US space program, the manual saying &quot;since 1962&quot; and obviously, well beyond 1984.<p>And indeed having been around in those years, the cameras proved their worth.  The images they captured were astonishing, looking like nothing else, in essence a unique art form truly living up to its actual &quot;other-worldliness&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve often thought the photographs of the early space era are among the most beautiful and haunting images of all time.  The fascination with the photos and the camera itself is certainly justified.<p>It was fun reading the pictorial advice contained in the manual, which stated classic ideas anyone interested in photography has probably encountered many times.  Yet the lessons could still be profitably applied in the digital era.  I remember &quot;exposing for the highlights&quot; with transparency films, and even in today&#x27;s world often enough it&#x27;s still a good idea.",1416294012

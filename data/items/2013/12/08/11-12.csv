6869539,comment,6869365,6869430,2,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"Reference counting is implemented by <a href=\"https://talloc.samba.org/talloc/doc/html/group__talloc__ref.html#ga1d70927673b42a6d2e42823307280502\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://talloc.samba.org/talloc/doc/html/group__talloc__ref....</a> or <a href=\"https://talloc.samba.org/talloc/doc/html/group__talloc__ref.html#ga573831a64a47a33cce8c80bde085e158\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://talloc.samba.org/talloc/doc/html/group__talloc__ref....</a> (talloc calls this &quot;adding a parent&quot; - note it does do quite a bit more than just incrementing an integer.)<p>You&#x27;re right that talloc has a memory overhead relative to smart pointers or a free_foo() function; talloc&#x27;ing up an int is very inefficient. Note that you can add a talloc-integrated &quot;destructor&quot; at zero marginal cost, so e.g. an array of a million pointers to individually-allocated int&#x27;s could let talloc manage the vector and free the int&#x27;s in the destructor. (That is, you can de-talloc part of a talloc&#x27;ed memory hierarchy.)<p>Additionally, malloc also has a runtime and memory cost; like talloc&#x27;s, this cost is high enough to discourage arrays of pointers to individually allocated int&#x27;s and low enough that it doesn&#x27;t matter for arrays of int&#x27;s. The one time I played around with talloc (for a network daemon), I didn&#x27;t really run into any allocations where I&#x27;d hesitate to use talloc but not to use malloc. (I forgot the numbers; a quick Google suggests that talloc adds 96 bytes to malloc&#x27;s 16 bytes of overhead.)<p>That said, just being disciplined about memory usage seems to work decently well, too. (For expert programmers with good tools, usually; it&#x27;s a hard problem.)",1386503859

6869517,comment,6869513,6869513,1,0,mazsa,,,"&quot;About the book<p>Homotopy type theory is a new branch of mathematics that combines aspects of several different fields in a surprising way. It is based on a recently discovered connection between homotopy theory and type theory. It touches on topics as seemingly distant as the homotopy groups of spheres, the algorithms for type checking, and the definition of weak ∞-groupoids. Homotopy type theory offers a new “univalent” foundation of mathematics, in which a central role is played by Voevodsky’s univalence axiom and higher inductive types. The present book is intended as a first systematic exposition of the basics of univalent foundations, and a collection of examples of this new style of reasoning — but without requiring the reader to know or learn any formal logic, or to use any computer proof assistant. We believe that univalent foundations will eventually become a viable alternative to set theory as the “implicit foundation” for the unformalized mathematics done by most mathematicians.&quot;<p>The making of HoTT book <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/68761218\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vimeo.com/68761218</a>",1386502582

If so, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call that especially difficult...<p>Building up ready-to-go materials (certainly as many as Vray ships with) undoubtedly takes time, but in the VFX industry, generally everyone writes their own shaders anyway...<p>Anyway, my focus is on VFX so I can concentrate on those type of issues, whereas I guess Vray needs to work well across different domains as well (product design, archviz, etc) - that&#x27;d be where things start getting difficult to balance out the different requirements I&#x27;d assume:<p>e.g. you can save quite a bit of memory by not storing vertex normals as vec3 floats, but as two 16-bit ushort numbers which can then be mapped via a LUT to the spherical coords of the normal. This is acceptable for VFX, and even in worst-case situations (very zoomed in on a very dense mesh with lots of crinkly displacement), it&#x27;s barely noticeable, but for archviz people rendering at 10k x 10k, they might spot the issues at that size...",1386500481

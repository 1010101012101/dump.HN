3062482,comment,3061050,3061225,4,0,vog,,,"(I'm the author of this little toy script)<p>Some small corrections:<p>The script is able to set 5 digits, not 4. The prefixes in the examples are actually 0001a, 0002a, etc.  I added the trailing ""a"" to make the numbers more readable. Otherwise you would get hashes like 00015... which would look awkward. So I'm using the ""a"" as a kind of separator.<p>Also, the script refuses to change timestamps by more than 30 minutes. So changing only the <i>committer timestamp</i> would allow you to set only 2-3 hash digits. That's why I'm also changing the <i>author timestamp</i>, which leads to enough possible combinations to set about 5 hash digits. (Unless you're unlucky, because there's always a rest possibility for failure in this kind of algorithms.)<p>BTW, this program has been inspired by BitCoin's proof of work concept.",1317549262

I've never had an issue previously with PayPal up until now but I've read some shockers about PayPal which concerns me (http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1096322756/working-on-a-friday-update-crying-over-paypal).<p>I received an email from Paypal over a week ago which states that they've decided to open an investigation of their own accord into a transaction of mine and that they require more information from me. I explained the transaction and that the buyer was furnished with a calling card code which they can use to place calls overseas in exchange for the payment made.<p>Today I receive the outcome of PayPal's decision. They decide to reverse the transaction and refund the customer. They provide no reasons for the decision they've made (which seems to be pretty standard for them based on what I've read).<p>So now the money's gone and I can't resell the calling card code either. Great.<p>So I write a complaint to PayPal:<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>To: PAYPAL<p>You have decided to reverse the transaction on this case:<p>Inquiry by PayPal - Case ID: PP-001-<i></i><i></i>*<p>for transaction ID: 6VB<i></i><i></i><p>Can you please explain your decision?<p>I explained previously to you when the investigation was opened that in exchange for the payment the buyer made, the buyer was sent a Calling Card Code.<p>This same buyer has made the same purchase on two previous occasions over the course of a year as you can see from the following transaction codes:<p>8TK6<i></i><i></i>
9PD3<i></i><i></i><p>Yet you have decided for no apparent reason to investigate and reverse the third transaction.<p>You have arbitrarily opened an investigation into a regular transaction and have created for me an unnecessary cost of time, effort and money. Furthermore, you have damaged my reputation to a repeat customer of mine.<p>I request that you reconsider the said case and explain your decision.<p>Richard<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>I emailed the buyer as well and he's decided to pay again for the previous transaction ;)<p>The way PayPal treats its customers baffles me sometimes.

3062471,comment,3061261,3062116,3,0,dalke,,,"It's amazing how we had any sort of industry before the car. I live in a relatively small (500,000) city, though Sweden's second largest. One of my clients is in an industrial area. The city has extra lines for the morning and evening commute, but only about 20% of the people use them, and I think another 5% cycle. I don't know how many walk into work, but clearly over 50% do drive in.<p>This in a city and country which is pro-mass transit, pro-bicycles and pro-high fuel tax. The turning point is often, as you say, when children are born. People do take their babies, in strollers, on the trams and busses, but it's much easier if you can leave spare diapers and such in the car and not lug them with you all day.<p>(Your comment about taking the bus with young kids to get groceries is specious. If density is high enough then it's easy to walk to a grocery store. In town there's three grocery stores within a few blocks of me, and a corner store .. on the corner. Surely that was the same in the dense European city you lived in?)<p>On the other hand, kids and people up to 20 ride free or at reduced price. This means greatly increased mobility for anyone over about 8 or so. I've read autobiographies of people raised in New York City during the 1950s or so, who describe the sense of freedom of being able to go to Coney Island, or Central Park. That's not possible without a car in the standard suburbia we're talking about.<p>That said, I really don't understand why a public transportation system needs ""to be a break-even affair."" The road system definitely is not. Gas taxes even in Sweden isn't enough to pay for the road network, snow cleaning, and so on. Public transit should properly be seen, like the roads, as having a multiplier effect. It means you can have areas of town with higher density, which support those people and families you are talking about, which have higher numbers of clubs and restaurants and shops, <i>and</i> have areas for families with cars.",1317548423

3062418,comment,3057684,3057684,2,0,salemh,,,"I would say most smart people over-think situations (re: opposite or same sex / partners) and never approach. Approaches is all that matters after a certain amount of numbers and (always / eventual) rejections. Analysis  paralysis.<p>Confidence with women (or, opposite sex, but, for sake of content reduction in this response, let's say men attracted to women) seems nearly completely unrelated to confidence in other area's (sports, work, monetary, etc.) However, those other area's of confidence can ""bleed"" into confidence with women via social circles, social proof, modeling other successful behavior, etc.<p>Social anxiety perhaps. See above on confidence differentials.<p>EG: conditioning for jiu jitsu or wrestling != conditioning from running long distance (give it try :D, you'll die in exhaustion in 2-3 minutes)<p><i>Smart kids usually come from smart families.</i>
?
Social pressure from family to date someone ""on the level"" of themselves? Why would you care if you are enjoying your time together? This is a personal problem, not your partners.<p><i>1) Smart people spent more time on achievements than on relationships when growing up.</i><p>Social anxiety / awkward in social dynamics for ""neglecting"" the experiences of such (does not have to be college oriented.)<p><i>So it only makes sense that in the romantic arena, it should work the same way.  Right?  The more stuff I do, the more accomplishments and awards I have, the more girls (or boys) will like me.  Right?  Please say Im right, because Ive spent a LOT of time and energy accumulating this mental jewelry, and Im going to be really bummed if you tell me its not going to get me laid.</i><p>Confidence and a sense of self, with varied interest is attractive. To everyone (even outside of sexual relationships, meaning, interesting social groups.)<p><i>2) Smart people feel that theyre entitled to love because of their achievements.</i><p>Anger develops this way from many men, leading to vicious cycle of being a bore, or creep :)<p><i>Part of the issue is this: when all of your personal energy is concentrated in the head, it never gets a chance to trickle down to the heart, or, god forbid, the groin.  By virtue of being born of the union of male and female, yang and yin, you are a sexual being.  Deal with it.  Now do what you need to do to perpetuate the race already.  Use what mama amoeba gave you.</i><p>I think another point in the article to stop over analyzing and just ""do.""<p><i>3) When you dont feel like a fully-realized sexual being, you dont act like one.</i><p>Sure...<i>""Perhaps you should consider thinking a little less then.""</i><p>Think less, go approach.<p>Though, not allowing yourself the mindset of ""I deserve a fine young women, intelligent, etc."" mean's you may not be ready for such. Not in a way of arrogance, in a way of self reflection.<p><i>4) Youre exceptionally talented at getting in the way of your own romantic success.</i><p>Redundant content?<p><i>5) By virtue (or vice) of being smart, you eliminate most of the planets inhabitants as a dating prospects</i><p><i>Still, thats less than one in five thousand people. And if you live in a smaller city, it may be just a handful of folks who are going to meet your stringent criteria.</i><p>This is a bull-shit excuse to not approach someone of interest, meaning, anxiety. It is far more entertaining to approach a random woman, learning something interesting, get a number, OR, get shot down to hell. Instead of, being back to square 1 at 'zero' interaction. Many get stuck in that singular approach > rejection > more fear, instead of approach > rejection > approach > rejection approach > conversation / rejection > approach > number > approach > number > approach > date or two > approach > rejection > repeat (decreased amount of rejections after X approaches, confidence is contagious).<p><i>At this point, you have three choices:</i><p><i>Loosen up</i>
<i>Do a very thorough search all over the planet and be prepared to move to Dsseldorf OR</i>
<i>Join a monastery.
</i>My hearty recommendation is choice A.  The purpose of relationship (and perhaps all of life) is to practice the loving.  No partner is going to be 100% perfect anyway, so learn to appreciate people for what they have to offer, not what they dont.  And love them for that.  Thats what real loving is*<p>Or; stop thinking, loosen up, have fun, pursue many interests, draw people into your circle of interests and meet interesting people.<p>For my own ""disclaimer:""<p>-Social anxiety in high school, low-amount of dating
-Went ""insane"" hitting on every woman in sight (attractive to me or not, it was building ""skills"" in rapport / flirting) for 2-3 years in my twenties, goals of short-term relationships. I ran this like a business. X amount of approaches, X amount of #'s, X amount of ""dates"", X amount of engagements. It normally averaged (after a month or so of getting destroyed by shutdowns :D) 4-12 phone #'s / week, 2-3 meetings, 1-2 engagements (sex or fling).
-Found a great gal in mid twenties. Thought it could last long-term, lasted a few years, it didn't end up lasting.
-More hermit like now, selective, higher ""standards"" of those I am interested in (in the sense of not being ridiculous with flirting with every girl around, not being snooty about it). I have fallen back into analysis paralysis TBH<p>-Keys to success? Getting rejected frequently. This leads to not caring (as much) with the emotional pain that brings. Approaching constantly, with a genuine interest in that person (not canned lines, but, if you have nothing to say, try a canned response anyway)
-Having fun
-Gotta be social. Must be around people / groups. Can't find ""love"" or multiple partners sitting at home 6x a week.<p>Notice how much of this applies to advice on entrepreneurship? During my ""insane"" days of managing metrics driven women goals, I was also running my lil business, with the same focus of #'s leading to results in sales / production.<p>Cheers.",1317546258

404391,comment,404009,404166,0,0,mlLK,,,"My first programming class (or my first class I had to use a compiler) was in C (it was one of those CSCI classes for non-majors) and this guy took us through the whole gamut, even if I barely passed the class, it was a rush. It was probably such a rush because I knew what I wanted to do, but had no idea how to express it, until we finally got to arrays, and I realized that a string is just an array of sorted characters. This insight catalyzed another insight and by the end of the year I was more interested in recursing meaningless input just to see what it looked like when it came out, which never really solved anything in my text-book, but this act taught me more about computer programming than any book could, this act showed me that computer programming is the art of counting and comparing for measuring an unknown order of magnitude. I came out of the course with so much more than what my grade reflected (somewhere between a D and C), but could really care less.<p>One semester later I ended up in a class called Object Oriented Analysis and Design; [insert brain hemorrhage here] I could not communicate with any of these people (nor my teacher) ever since the problem domain was suddenly so tangible, it seemed so much less enticing. This was when I laid my eccentric theory to rest, went with the flow, and started solving my exercises.",1229758965

(In the <i>same sentence</i> where you called me an ""asshole"".)  I was just pointing out that you weren't really behaving in a way that often leads to constructive discussion.  Consider it a tip.  No charge!  Feel free to call me an ""asshole"" as often as you please, if that's what melts your butter.  Or a ""motherfucker"" or ""dickhead"" if you like.  It really doesn't matter to me.  But it probably won't lead to constructive conversation!<p>I pretty much gave up hope of constructive discussion when you put words in my mouth, totally failed to understand what I wrote, and accused Twitter of taking a bribe.

404381,comment,404343,404343,0,0,agotterer,,,"The downloads tax is one thing. Although I dont think they are entitled to it unless the business is operating in New York. But a really good way to get New Yorkers to stop using taxis and going to bars is to make it more expensive then it already is. A beer in New York cost $6 to $8 on average. People love drinking and they wont stop because of this. But they will either drink less or do it in their home. Either way; the bar loses, the consumer loses, the government loses and the recession gets deeper.<p>The rich are the folks who save, for everyone else money burns a hole in their pocket. Save them money, they will spend it on more items and you still get to collect taxes.",1229757674

404372,comment,403562,404191,0,0,webwright,,,"Taking the risk and grabbing something generic-but-powerful, like ""business.com"" or ""porn.com"" seems fine.  Grabbing someone elses brand name for the purpose of squatting on it and then extorting the trademark owner just seems wrong.<p>The point is that the domains would have almost ZERO value if the business who has the trademark hadn't spent huge piles of money building the brand and the goodwill around it.  In this guys case, he grabs @celtics and tosses up some basketball stats, and he's basically leeching off the brand.  It's not dissimilar to setting up a Hamburger stand and calling it ""McDonalds"" with a stylized ""M"" logo.<p>In domain/twitter name case, there's no actual risk being taken.  Twitter names are free.  Domain names are cheap ($30/year at first).  So in my mind, they should be compensated at a reasonable price for the risk they took...  Let's say 30x return on whatever they put into it.  :-)",1229756465

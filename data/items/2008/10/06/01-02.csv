Hit up every pawn shop in town and offer to send an intern over to index their stuff?<p>- Some sort of trade system where people could list stuff they want to get rid of and stuff they'd like to get?<p>- Offer services for eBay / Craigslist with some sort of incentive to move over to your platform?<p><i>(Also, please break or remove the long preformatted lines in the article submission.

324522,comment,324485,324485,0,0,LPTS,,,"I only have time for feedback on the design of the front page.<p>It's pretty damn good.  Way better then most of the stuff I see when I'm at Y combinator.  I had thoughts on the right hand column.<p>Your order is:<p>sign in, then use onista to... then not a member, join, then invite friends, then demo.<p>I think the order:<p>sign in, not a member, join, then use Onista to... makes more sense, with invite your friends only showing up to logged in users.  The demo video should show up like youtube vids do, instead of the clip art, and be on the left hand side, maybe where the slogans are.<p>Also, I think your three slogans should be saved for elevator rides with people you have 30 sec to pitch too, rather then customer facing.  ""Think outside auctions and classifieds  Eliminate listing fees!  Leverage the power of social networks"" is for industry people, not your customers.  The only critique here I am absolutely sure about is that you should never ever ever say ""leverage the power of social networks"" to your customers.<p>But, thats nitpicky.  Your site design looks pretty damn good.  I particularly like your colors.  It makes my eyes feel relaxed and happy.  Far better then most sites I see linked from here.  Usually I'm talking about how much the design sucks and how the designer should find a new job, or there wasn't someone focused on that.  You should keep your designer.  Sorry I don't have more time to comment in detail.  Nice work!",1223257540

324518,comment,324501,324501,0,0,geuis,,,"Unfortunately, there wasn't a single point in this fellow's article that stands. Frequently the authors of stories criticizing PHP write it from the perspective of a newbie first encountering a language. Maybe its just me, but I don't care about newbies. I've been writing applications with PHP for the better part of 4 years. Its a very strong language, and the parts that are ""loose"", like weakly typed variables and all of the predefined functions make the process of writing working code much easier. Perhaps its just me, but my definition of a good developer is one that knows what the hell they're doing. I have no problem debugging my code. Other people that read my code have no problem reading/debugging it. Its efficient, OO-style. \nSure, maybe something like Ruby is ""easier"". One day I'll get some time and try figuring that out. Meanwhile, people keep bashing PHP. Why don't you bash Java instead?<p>I've worked in 2 different companies that are Java shops. Its scared the crap out of me. I've yet to encounter a ""java engineer"" that has a freaking clue to good development practices. They almost <i>universally</i> insist on using tag libraries instead of writing code. Java and its adherents have been the only group of people I have ever encountered that insist on wrapping a perfectly valid markup language like HTML into A FREAKING TAG LIBRARY, THAT JUST OUTPUTS HTML?!?!?! Every bad web development practice I've ever encountered is epitomized by ever java engineer I've ever encountered.",1223257125

You mention a ""social marketplace"" and your front page says ""Leverage the power of social networks"" but I don't see any features that make your site social, or where I can leverage the power of social networks.<p>You have a community tab where users can have events. Why would I use your site for events, why not evite, facebook, etc...? You should focus on one thing and do it well, instead of adding tons of features but neglecting your main focus. ""Less is more"", right?<p>Bugs: \n1. I just did a search for ""car"" and got no results. Although you clearly have a car for sale on the site. \n2. The captcha on the register page doesn't load an image until I click on the ""Try another Image"" link. \n3. In the community -> Questions and Answers, a search for ""sell"", ""selling"", and ""fees"" returned no results (in fact, nothing returned any results).<p>Overall, I don't see any unique value created for the user. I'd love for you to tell me I'm wrong and point me to some features/aspects that I missed. (Maybe all the social features are still in development?).",1223256930

324512,comment,324315,324465,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"Thanks.  I'm very aware of Newsvine.  Gotta respect what's come before!<p>My issue with Newsvine, and sites like Newser, Google news and all of the pure Digg-clones, etc is that they're run by hackers, not news people. And no matter what the founders say, they all have the same business model, to make money by commoditizing expensive stuff (journalism) that someone else paid for (newspapers).<p>The idea with my startup <a href=""http://www.windycitizen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.windycitizen.com</a> (we did 50,000 uniques last week...and now apache crashes every 2 hours :( ) is to bring NEW stuff to the web. I want to fill holes in the internet. 3-4 times a week we publish exclusive original stuff.  Last week we scooped the Chicago media so badly that the Tribune ran a copycat version of the story the next day.  That was fun. I've never heard of Newsvine breaking a big story.<p>So yeah, Newsvine's great, but I want to get something going that will support original journalism of the type described in the original link.<p>Getting it going is rough, of course.  I'm bootstrapping based on advice from a few entrepreneurs.

324510,comment,324315,324315,0,0,13ren,,,"<i>[Craig Newmark of craigslist] is what business school people call a ""bad competitor"" because he appears more interested in serving society than making money.</i><p><i>He does make money by charging certain kinds of users, but the bulk of his service is free. He is like Henry Ford who, after introducing the Model T, lowered prices, increased wages and concentrated on market share rather than maximizing profit. When challenged by shareholders unhappy that their dividends weren't higher, he replied that they should view his company as ""an instrument of service rather than as a machine for making money.""</i><p>startup relevance: I've seen growth at the expense of profit painted as megalomaniacal empire-building, and I felt the strain of the selfishness of it, but not recognized it intellectually. Growth can sometimes be justified economically, if it can improve future profitability, so it's not ""growth vs. profit"" but ""future vs. now"" (i.e. an investment). There's security in not maximizing immediate profits, too - craigslist isn't going out of business any time soon; and the goodwill generated by ""leaving money on the table"" is arguably worth something.",1223255896

The hedge fund only capitalized the subsidiary selling the CDSs with $4 million.<p>There is a reason we regulate insurance companies... to make sure they maintain adequate capital to back up their policies.

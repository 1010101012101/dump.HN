Think of iWagerr as a notepad-like web app that simply allows you to <i>record</i> or <i>track</i> all of your wagers (financial or not). There is no money passing through iWagerr (no credit or points system either), just a tally of whether or not you've won or lost bets, so that $1000 riding on Butler vs VCU might as well be 1000 burgers or a trip to the Bahamas.<p>So to answer your question, I wouldn't have an issue with people using it to track their financial bets (though, admittedly, I'd like them to use it to track their <i>non-financial</i> bets, since those are typically made with lighter, less-serious intentions!).",1301738199

2399594,comment,2399054,2399054,2,0,asymptotic,,,"Everyone here's already given solid advice to you, so I'm here to offer my two cents from a slightly different perspective.<p>In ""Outliers"", Malcolm Gladwell points out research that indicates there are three requirements for a job to be satisfying: ""autonomy"", or you getting to decide what you will do or how you will do, ""complexity"", that the job is full of tasks that engage you emotionally and intellectually at a ""Goldilocks"" difficulty level (not too hard, not too easy), and ""connection between effort and reward"", i.e. the harder you work the more you get rewarded.<p>In my experience, while learning new programming languages, frameworks, and software engineering concepts, since my learning happens in my free time I have bucket loads of autonomy but I often misguage the complexity level and sometimes fail to offer myself any opportunity for reward in the long run.<p>Hence, here are two more pieces of advice.  Firstly, work on a real project, ideally for a person in real life.  Someone who breathes, feels, and is willing to drink coffee with you.  Ask _them_ what they want, tell them you're trying to pick up a new skill and want to help them out!  What better connection between effort and reward can there be than helping a real person?  (I hear people saying ""money, money, money!"", and yes I hear you).<p>Secondly, start at rock bottom and learn everything from scratch.  Assume you know nothing.  Be the proverbial empty cup; a student approaches a Zen master with a cup and says ""Master, teach me everything you know!"" and the master proceeds to fill the student's cup with tea until it starts to overflow hot water onto the students hands.  The student looks confused until the master responds ""How can I fill your cup when it is already full?"".  Then, once you get started, offer yourself increasingly more difficult challenges and concepts.  Continually progress your knowledge.  Even in a language as sublime and as easy to initially use as Python there are always more concepts to learn, more elegant approaches, faster methods.<p>Good luck!",1301737539

But the cost of learning enough stuff not to get myself in trouble has probably been tens of hours of otherwise billable time, plus the ever present risk of doing something wrong.<p>The problem is that it can be hard to know what is actually difficult, and what is easy but just expensive because not many people know how to do it. It would be nice if somewhere there was a definitive guide to what is worth doing yourself for any given hourly rate.<p>E.g. if your time is worth £50/hr then doing your own company set up is worth it, but you should hand off pay roll taxes to a professional. If your time is worth £100 an hour, then you should do these three things to cut cost a little, then outsource the rest.",1301737313

Or you can try to overhaul the templating. It's a boring problem.<p>Databases are much more interesting. You simply can't scale databases up trivially. A N times linear improvement in the code (due to, say, caching) means you don't have to throw N^2 servers (if that's how your database scales) at the problem.<p>Linear load reductions have superlinear cost reductions for things like databases. Linear load reductions have linear cost reductions for web servers. This is why people don't care so much.<p>Though yes, it would be nice to see Ruby templating a little bit faster.",1301736684

2399569,comment,2399139,2399139,123,0,grellas,,,"Corporations are not particularly hard or expensive to start, maintain, or dissolve - <i>but</i> you need to be at a stage of life where a thousand dollars here or there is not a major burden. If you are not yet at that stage, that is a different story and there is no doubt that forming or dissolving an entity such as this will normally set you back a thousand or two on either side. In that case, you should tread cautiously unless you can raise some funds (even if it friends-and-family money) to be able to handle such costs without too much pain.<p>As a lawyer, I would have to say that you should do it by the book and dissolve the entity. I have, however, had a variety of clients over the years who left a Delaware corporation to die without dissolving it and they have not had trailing personal liabilities as a result of the accrued corporate franchise taxes (of course, it is a different matter if the corporation earned a net profit and has an obligation to file income taxes - in that case, failure to file can cause serious problems for the corporation and for its management).<p>The $89K tax bill is typical of any Delaware corporation that has large numbers of authorized shares, even with a low par value. This often proves a shock to unsuspecting founders who file a do-it-yourself entity without understanding the issues. However, in almost all cases involving an early stage startup, you can deal with this easily by using the alternative valuation method tied to value of assets in the company. Use of the alternative method usually reduces the franchise tax to a very low level. It is easy to find out how to use the alternative method (forms and instructions are available online through the Delaware Secretary of State).<p>It seems that you needed to set up the entity in order to try to manage the issues with your co-founder and so the choice to set up a corporation was not really a mistake. The choice to set it up in Delaware for a simple situation can be a mistake, in my judgment, but I am probably in the minority among startup lawyers on this issue in believing that a home-state incorporation in the interests of keeping things simple can be and often is the best choice for founders (see <a href=""http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_002.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_002.html</a>). It is no disgrace for a Silicon Valley startup to incorporate in California, even for a public company (no less than Apple itself is a California corporation). Had you done a home-state incorporation, you would have avoided the hassles with the $89K tax bill, as most states besides Delaware states have a fixed, low amount that you pay every year as a minimum franchise tax (in California, $800).<p>Incorporation is definitely not for everyone. When and if to incorporate can be tricky questions. I also have outlined a few of the factors to guide that decision as well (<a href=""http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_007.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_007.html</a>).<p>There are a good number of early-stage startups that really can't easily afford professional fees and so the answer is not to use a lawyer in all cases to incorporate. But, even if you can't afford a lawyer, it is always worth consulting with one for strategic advice on incorporating before you do so. Such a first consultation is dirt cheap in most cases, and sometimes free. The modest amount paid is well worth it just to be alerted to the main issues and pitfalls involved in setting up an entity. Thus, while it was probably not a mistake in itself to set up your corporation, it likely was a big mistake to do so without some guidance of this type (I had made this comment in connection with your original piece as well - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1924719"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1924719</a>).<p>Sorry to hear about the business failure.

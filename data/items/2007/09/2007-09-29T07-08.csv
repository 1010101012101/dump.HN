Q's<p>- Are you going to sort them by anything date, score, user or just date order? <p>- Supply a data feed?
 
- identify user <p>- are you archiving them?<p>
Like yourself I wanted to grab stuff so I wouldn't miss it. Another was to capture metadata and add some useful extra stuff like<p>- identify users by various metrics<p>- graphing of data<p>- capture relationships b/w users, data<p>You can only do this with raw data.  I'm thinking about archiving the data at least at some time. <p>Good stuff btw. I like this because the more resources we have like this the more fun you can have and more value you can add. If I have one request that would be to add a data feed that anyone can pull and use.<p>You can read how here ~ <a href=""http://goonmail.customer.netspace.net.au/hackerid/colophon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goonmail.customer.netspace.net.au/hackerid/colophon/</a>",1191049938

  Why do we continue, in 2007, to believe that 
  markets are all about What Big Companies Do? 
  Worse, why do we continue to take advertising 
  for granted as the primary source of the the Bux 
  DeLuxe required to fund technical, social and 
  personal progress?

Don't think so. Just checked it and pulled this in. I would be nice if Hacker News had a link checker every once and a while on say a threshold of 2 or 3. But then again high traffic subs would quickly expose this. ",1191049221

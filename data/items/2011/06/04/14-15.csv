That is a Huge positive for me, even though I hope to never write another line of Fortran in my life. Sometimes there is no 'selling' new tech to a CIO; it just needs to both appear and actually be absolutely solid (for lack of a better word).<p>Incidentally, I don't think this is a poorly titled article at all -- the author was being ironic, and will probably be rewarded with a 10x spike in traffic from people looking for talking points to take to their next Rails meetup... that's actually pretty funny.",1307199219

He's making the mistake of conflating a company as stagnating based solely on the fact that the stock is still trading in the same ranges as it was 6 months ago.<p>First off, I don't see how you can call a company stagnant that reported a record profit in Q2 with 95% growth year over year, including a 113% unit growth in it's primary product.<p>Secondly, he ignores a number of factors that have influenced Apple's stock price independently of company fundamentals like the rebalancing of the Nasdaq and the current weekly option plays that are collaring Apple.<p>Not to mention he ignores everything that has been hammering stocks in general, given economic and political uncertainty in much of the world.<p>So outside of actual financials, other things also struck me wrong in his post. If iPads are for geeks only, then there must be a hell of a lot of geeks in corporate America, because I am seeing these things adopted everywhere for all sorts of uses.  Also, his supposition that ""Software doesnâ€™t move product"" is probably the most ridiculous.  Apple's whole proposition from the original Mac onwards was the software.

As a result (and the blog author says this), there is enough hate-worthy Java code there, just as there used to be enough hate-worthy C and C++ code around, and there probably is enough hate-worthy COBOL and Ada code around, if you know where to look.<p>It's worth noting that the relationship between C++ and Java switched around in the last 12 years or so - before, C++ was the method of choice to write segfaulting bug-ridden Windows applications (MFC anyone?), whereas Java was a rather slow (as in, non-JIT-ted) language that was up and coming and was interesting because it combined familiar C-like syntax with garbage collection.<p>Fast forward, and we have not only smart pointers (which ease many headaches of non-garbage-collected C++) but also template metaprogramming which really took off and makes C++ much more palatable to the one-man-army approach (i.e., one smart guy who does work that would take several mediocre programmers otherwise). Java has also evolved - Java 1.2's List/Map/Set are much nicer than the old collections, and Java 1.5's generics help avoid much of the old ugliness - but it carefully avoids any constructs that would make it more useful for one-man-army stuff - where Rubyists and Pythonistas are monkey-patching metaclass decorators, the Java world has one or two libraries that do bytecode generation to do something useful, but nothing more magic.<p>People who hate Java are really out against the programmer-as-a-fungible-resource way of living where programming is treated like shoveling dirt instead of a creative activity. Programming is both - perspiration and inspiration - and some people will be allowed to chose their tools (Java or not) whereas other people are not or have to fight for it.",1307198096

What I realized later though is that you can't use Java very efficiently in a small shop (one or two guys).<p>Nowadays there are other languages and toolkits out there that bring me better joy on a daily basis. C-based languages are not the issue here (I love Objective-C), it's the frameworks and patterns that soured my interest in Java. IoC, dependency injection, xml config this, facade that - for today's speed of 'innovation' and time to market, the Java universe for development can be too big and slow.<p>Most of the people I've run into post-'06 don't use Java anymore. These are usually small startups (as I don't do enterprise anymore) and the names that always come out are Python, Php, Ruby/Rails, Obj-C, JS, and even Scala. In my mind this is telling of where things are  going, just like the early days of Java when people still used Perl and C++ for web. I think Java's continual evolution (or at least usage of the JVM) into things like Scala and Clojure are good things. But it's glory days being at the forefront of web development are behind it.<p>Ultimately I think this as fine as every dog has its day.

2619536,comment,2619423,2619423,44,0,hadtocomment,,,"I could write a book on my experience going from $12/hr to $85/hr on odesk. It's been quite an experience.<p>I get plenty of invitations for projects at a rate slightly above $60/hr. I haven't bid on a project in many months, and I even hid my profile for a while when things got too busy at my day job.<p>There are a few things you need to do to be successful on odesk. I've never done a project on another site, so I don't know if these tips translate, but some of them should.<p>1) Get some feedback as soon as possible. Find a small project to get your feet wet and bid a low rate to get the job.<p>2) Answer requests from the prospective client as soon as possible.<p>3) Use your best grammar. I find it helps me to speak to the prospective client on the phone. YMMV.<p>4) When you apply to a project, read the project and ask questions. Don't just make some generic cover letter and spam the clients.<p>5) When you apply to the project, if you are particularly interested in the project, have past experience with the project, or have some interesting piece of information to share with the client, make that clear. It helps you stand out.<p>6) Take the English test on odesk and do well on it.<p>7) Fill out your profile. Put relevant projects (even those you didn't do on odesk) in your portfolio. Provide links to your work.<p>8) Do good work. Make your clients happy. Get good feedback.<p>9) Remember that price is a signal. Many US clients will assume that you must be good to charge such a high rate.<p>I used to post on HN as briancooley, but I added one too many zeros to my noproc setting and put myself on about a 694-day hiatus instead of a 69.4-day hiatus. <i>oops</i> Can't say that I miss posting much, but I thought I would offer some suggestions.

I think there's a better way to do this than you suggest (time-limit before they're kicked for no retina support).<p>Start enforcing this rule after, say, 3 months - to give devs enough time to comply. From then on, any app which is either submitted (for the first time), or updated, needs to have Retina support, or it gets rejected.<p>This stops apps unexpectedly disappearing, e.g. if someone has other commitments than iOS development, whilst ensuring that all well-updated, still-supported apps start to support Retina.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if Apple did enforce something like this if (when) the iPad 3 gets Retina support.",1307197371

Some jobs are either not serious about hiring or don't care about quality and are actively seeking the lowest price. They will be disappointed and their project will probably never be finished the way they want it. You don't want to work with these people, and you don't want to compete down to an unreasonable wage unless you're just starting out.<p>There is, however, a smaller set of jobs which you are qualified for based on your unique skillset and which will recognize quality and ignore price. If you can convince these employers that you are the best for the job, you can get some decent, well-paying work.<p>The problem is, with ubiquitous ""race to the bottom"" low bids on nearly every project (many of them automatically generated and of extremely poor quality) it's really hard to tell the difference between the two.

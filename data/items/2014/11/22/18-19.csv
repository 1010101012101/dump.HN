8646314,comment,8645443,8645443,0,0,_paulc,,,"FreeBSD user since 2.0.5 (1995) - Linux since 0.95<p>I have always found that FreeBSD has had a much cleaner and more orthogonal feel as a system than any of the Linux distros and was always much more familiar for UNIX &#x27;old hands&#x27;. If you come from the school where UNIX systems shouldn&#x27;t have displays or the frippery associated with PCs and should be interacted with from a terminal you will probably be comfortable with FreeBSD. It shines as a rock-stable server O/S and in most cases trying to use it as a desktop is going to be fairly frustrating - the easiest way round this is not to bother and buy a MacBook Pro.<p>My view is that in the late 90s early 2000s adoption was impacted fairly significantly by two rather flaky major releases (3.0 & 5.0) where major bits of the system (SMP/Giant lock) were upgraded and took a long time to stabilise. These felt like a step back from the previous rock solid releases (2.2.8 & 4.11). Realistically the next really good release was the 8.0 series but since then the pace of development has really taken off and the 9.0 and 10.0 series are outstanding.<p>My view is that it is a great choice as a server O/S - with the significant commercial backing as an embedded O/S looks to have a strong future. I know that there will continue to be an interest in getting the desktop bits working but to be honest I think that this is a lost cause and should be dropped (though I acknowledge that the PC-BSD team doesn&#x27;t agree)<p>One other point is that there is probably a chunk of the Linux userbase who probably shouldn&#x27;t try FreeBSD as it really isn&#x27;t aimed at them.",1416682737

8646291,comment,8645443,8646207,0,0,barrkel,,,"Zfs, to take one example, does do approximately what you want - the file system (or rather, the underlying block storage) has a tree structure, and changes to files are propagated via copy-on-write rewrites up the tree, so that earlier snapshots still get to see the original file.<p>This does make rolling things back trivial.<p>It doesn&#x27;t give you dedupe for free, though. Think about what would have to happen: every modification would mean rehashing the modified block (not a problem, that should happen anyway to verify integrity). Let&#x27;s say we dedupe at the block level rather than the file level to avoid the need for more expensive hashing operations, and to increase the likelihood of actually sharing stuff. Now, to determine whether we can deallocate the new block, we need to look up the hash. So we need an index of every block on the file system by hash. That necessarily involves either a big chunk of memory or a bunch of random I/O. Both are at a premium for a filesystem - the former for cache, the latter for throughput.<p>If you just want file dedupe, it&#x27;s a smaller problem, but is less likely to create gains - most people don&#x27;t store many copies of the same file, unless they&#x27;re in the third party file storage business. So it isn&#x27;t really suited to a general file system. If this is something you want, you could periodically go through your file system, hash all files with only one link count in the inode, and hard link them using the hash as a file name, into an set of directories fanning out by hash prefix. There may be some wrinkles with permissions; I believe btrfs has a different kind of copy with copy-on-write semantics that might be useful here.",1416682366

8646280,comment,8645443,8645443,0,0,emcrazyone,,,"These discussions usually amount to flame wars but I will offer some real world usage perspective.  I use to work for a fortune-5 company that standardized on Linux.  We compiled our own Linux kernel and we used the SUSE distribution from Novell.  The main driver behind this was two fold.  (1) Novell indemnifies us from a legal perspective and (2) they support us on IBM hardware.  Any problem from drivers, to user space apps (CUPS, Syslog, etc...) they support us.  These are pretty much required by large companies.<p>I&#x27;m still in the automotive field but now I work on embedded stuff.  I&#x27;m one of the software developers behind CUE (Cadillac User Experience) and Linux is the go-to defacto standard pretty much because all the BSP (Board Support Packages) run Linux.  For example, Freescale iMX processors and their demo kits are all Linux based and so brining up drivers for iMX ethernet, SPI, GPIO, I2S and I2C have some sort of vendor support.<p>The large fortune-5 companines indirectly support Linux by entering multi millon dollar support contracts with companies like Novell and RedHat.  To give an example:  We once had an issue with CUPS where the root cause was a software bug.  Novell, under the support agreement, fixed the issue and then submitted the patch back to the open source community.<p>So from my perspective, I can see how Linux seems to have more traction than openBSD.  Linux seems to have a larger following in the automotive sector but I&#x27;m not sure if Linux&#x27;s success is because of these factors I&#x27;m pointing too or if these factors are because a lot of people just know of or about Linux more so than openBSD.<p>There also seem to be more company backed open source projects that support Linux before openBSD.  Example is Yocto which advertises itself as an open source Linux build system.  And recently Freescale has been moving their LTIB BSP tools to Yocto.<p>I would be interested in hearing how others industries are using Linux outside automotive.",1416682099

Except it&#x27;s designed to never delete anything, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the garbage collection.<p>Camlistore and TahoeLAFS are both designed this way.  But they are more of a content store than a file system.<p>In fact, BTRFS is implemented this way.  The content and the metadata can be separately treated with mirrors vs raid.  You can balance just the metadata or both data and metadata.  When you convert an ext2/3/4 file system to BTRFS, it just sets up it&#x27;s own metadata pointing to the same blocks that the ext used.  You get a free snapshot of your data pre-conversion and it&#x27;s all COW from then on.  I believe the B-Tree of BTRFS is the metadata and the content never changes on disk until no more pointers exist.  If you decide to go back, it just restores the superblock and the old data is still in the same spot.  You would only regain that space after you delete the snapshot and the last pointers to the data are gone.",1416681845

8646228,comment,8645394,8646186,0,0,derefr,,,"I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the case. Erlang has public-addressable processes: you can pass a process&#x27;s handle around, and then anything with that handle can direct messages to that process—including messages containing their own process handles, allowing for responses; built on top of this, there&#x27;s a global service registry, allowing <i>anything</i> to direct messages to a given process. Despite this, Erlang still doesn&#x27;t need futures/promises.<p>Generally, futures/promises just solve the problem of how to simulate blocking within an event-loop-driven (i.e. cooperatively-scheduled) platform, e.g. Node. When actor-processes are cheap, your consumer can be an actor which just <i>actually blocks</i> on a result—and then continues execution in the same linear block of code when that result arrives.<p>To put it another way: in non-actor languages, you&#x27;d see a block of code like this...<p><pre><code>    do_random_other_work();\n    bfn_args = some_setup();\n    blocking_fn(bfn_args).then(function(result) {\n      console.log(result);\n    });\n    more_random_other_work();\n      </code></pre>\n...while in actor-modelled languages, it&#x27;d go more like this:<p><pre><code>    do_random_other_work();\n    spawn(function() {\n      bfn_args = some_setup();\n      result = blocking_fn(bfn_args);\n      console.log(result);\n    });\n    more_random_other_work();\n</code></pre>\nNote how you have a closure in both cases, but they contain different parts of the code. The actor-modelled closure contains the setup work of sending the message, as well as the work of dealing with the reply—which must be linear with respect to one-another, but which can all happen concurrently to the random other work.<p>As well, notice that the actor-modelled version of blocking_fn is actually a plain old <i>blocking function</i>—a synchronous-IO read, for example. The blocking_fn in the promise-modelled code, on the other hand, is a special function which must be defined using a promises library, and must do the work of ensuring its asynchronicity at definition-time, whether or not a given consumer wants to call the function in an async way relative to its own thread of execution.<p>In short, idiomatic actor-modelled code puts the consuming programmer in control of which tasks are linear and which are concurrent, which usually makes for succinct, reusable plainly-synchronous functions that Get Things Done, and higher-level glue code that represents all the policy of what concurrency happens where. Promises throw out all these advantages and mix policy with mechanism in a way that increases verbosity and decreases reusability.",1416681150

It seems to me like it would make more sense to have only one copy of a file ever saved and when modifications are made you get a new pointer to the changed file. Obviously it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to do full copy on modifications for files over a certain size, but in this situation the filesystem could offer an abstraction over a patch and pointer to the original file until the system is idling and a full copy could be made.<p>The reason I ask about this is because it would make updating anything and rolling things back trivial since it would simply be a pointer change in the file hierarchy hash map from the new file to the old file and back again. Furthermore, such a system would give you dedupe for free and files could be marked for deletion only once the last pointer to the file in the CAS has been deleted.",1416680801

Every program rolls their own format, so you end up with a bunch of custom rules for configuring each application on the system. This makes life tedious for anyone automating system management and, on a practical level, increases the chance of human error when someone forgets the precise ways in which their experience with something else isn&#x27;t quite portable.<p>2. There are a wide range of supported features – e.g. interaction with environmental variables or external defines / defaults, ability to reference other config values, ability to either include a file or merge config parsed from a different location – and this leads to more tooling to paper over the gaps.<p>3. Hierarchy and discovery: in Windows or OS X, the preference system has the concept of user, system and domain config so you can set sane defaults at the domain level but a user can still override one of them just for their account. (There&#x27;s another interesting tangent here where it&#x27;s useful to have config supplied with a package which can be selectively overridden by a sysadmin without forking the entire file)<p>This works, at least for certain values of &quot;works&quot;, because there&#x27;s a single standardized API for working with the registry or plist files.<p>I generally dislike the details of plists but the fact that I can e.g. run &quot;defaults read [scope] key value&quot; and get the same effective config value which an application will use without knowing at which level it was last set or even whether the file was the older XML plist format or the newer binary one is really handy.<p>The fact that a config tool can simply run &quot;defaults write [scope] key value&quot; and not have to worry about those same mechanics is even nicer for sparing me time worrying about e.g. editing a text file safely, knowing whether I can just dump a new value at the end or must purge old values first (oops, FooD stops at first value while BarD uses the last and BazD does either depending on quirky rules you&#x27;ll just have to learn…), etc.<p>Similarly, launchd has a regrettable config syntax but I&#x27;ve forgiven it at lot because it&#x27;s a relief to use the same tool everywhere rather than needing the accumulation of different hacks and kludges which sysv init/cron or, absurdly, upstart still require in practice.<p>What would be really nice would be someone building a library with plenty of language which supported configuration based on the classic Unix config files but with a defined syntax and well-documented strategies for error handling and hierarchy and started working to help popular programs migrate over on the next backwards-incompatible release. There&#x27;s certainly no technical reason why any of the good parts should require Apple&#x27;s XML cruft or the accumulated bad culture around the Windows registry.",1416680272

Actual socialist parties have waned to a barely marginal existence in most European countries, and often have at most a &quot;tea party&quot; like relationship to more center-left social-democratic parties.  America&#x27;s Democratic Party is closer to a European Social Democrat party than a centrist European Liberal Democrat party, as America&#x27;s use of the word Liberal is far to the left of European use of the term.  Many European countries have sizable centrist &#x27;classical liberal&#x27; parties that would actually be considered &#x27;to the right&#x27; of American liberals, oddly enough.<p>So no, America is not really a right and far right country, it&#x27;s more a polity of extreme Conservative and progressive ideologies lorded over by two centrist parties with a heavily authoritarian commonality between them.  What the U.S. entirely lacks is an anti-authoritarian centrist Liberalism akin to that in Europe.<p>To illustrate, if we were to align US parties to those parties in the UK, you&#x27;d likely get the following:  the conservative Republicans (US) align to the conservative Tories (US), the far right Tea Party aligns to the far right UKIP (UK), the progressive Democrats (US) align to the social democratic Labor party (UK), and then the UK&#x27;s centrist Liberal Democrats do not align to any recognizable political organization in the US.  The UK Lib Dems at best might loosely align to a combination of US civil libertarians and classical liberals, both of which belong more or less to the politically homeless.  Some might say those fall under the Democrat tent, and yet the most vocal proponent of civil liberties in the US government right now is conservative Rand Paul, so go figure.<p>To come full circle, a US equivalent of the UK LibDems, were it to exist, would likely be the most vocal opposition to the NSA.<p>Appropriate username btw :)",1416679857

I&#x27;d already been playing for months so was familiar w/ the ins and outs of the game - this led to me being one of the first GM mages on the server (when magery was the only way to really fight). I had a fast connection and single digit pings when most people were just starting to get 28.8 modems - I was often accused of cheating as I&#x27;d appear to warp around people&#x27;s screens (from my perspective I could easily overtake people who were riding horses when I was on foot). While I wasn&#x27;t particularly good at PvP from a player skill perspective, I had enough advantages that I could count on 2 hands the number of people I actually feared.<p>At the time <i>many</i> new players would find themselves dastardly due to clicking on the wrong thing once or twice - they didn&#x27;t even mean to do anything wrong and half the time it was due to lag. So what I&#x27;d do is dress up in newb gear, hang outside the dungeon near Britain and pretend to be very lagged. At the time you couldn&#x27;t see people&#x27;s skill levels (stuff like this is why they put that in) so you&#x27;d just see my character name, that I was dastardly, I appeared to be a n00b and I could barely move.<p>So then these brave souls would attack me, often in a pack - not because they actually thought I was a bad person but because they a) could and b) I was an easy target who couldn&#x27;t fight back. I&#x27;m sure you can see where this is going, after I&#x27;d wipe the floor with their whole crew they&#x27;d come back and call me a cheater and a horrible human being. Sorry, I wasn&#x27;t the one attacking a defenseless n00b.<p>And yes, one could argue this from an RP perspective that in fact my char <i>was</i> a criminal and they were meting out justice but approximately 0.1% of people actually were doing that despite what they&#x27;d claim, the rest were just being turds.",1416679475

The only thing that has been unstable about my system is the function of my USB A/D converter (microphone). Other than that, there has never been an upgrade where something broke. Now, sure, it is wise to check the Arch homepage before you upgrade, just in case some action needs to be taken: that&#x27;s something that you don&#x27;t really have to do with, e.g., Debian. But if you do that, as I&#x27;ve done, you probably will never have major problems upgrading.<p>In fact, I actually dread Ubuntu updates far more ... I&#x27;ve had them break various and sundry things about my (previously-working) system. In my experience, at least, Ubuntu is far less stable than Arch. With that said, though, I haven&#x27;t used Ubuntu since 12.04 and 10.04 before that, so I don&#x27;t know how it fares anymore.",1416679381

8646135,comment,8645443,8645443,0,0,lifeforms,,,"I have introduced FreeBSD at a number of companies, and I&#x27;m a big fan of it, but also like Debian and Ubuntu a lot. Here are some things I like about FreeBSD:<p>* Since it&#x27;s all developed in a smaller community, and FreeBSD hackers/users tend to be pretty opinionated about many things, most subsystems have a consistent feel and are very unsurprising. This makes that you can often guess and be right. It also means you don&#x27;t get to have some hyped trends. (I have the same feeling about the Go language and community by the way.)<p>* This might be subjective but I feel that many administration tasks are very transparent, orthogonal and simple. Many system configuration, like enabling of services, network configuration, can be changed by a simple setting in a /etc/rc.conf shellvariables file with defaults in /etc/defaults/rc.conf. Stuff ends up in understandable text config files. Comments and options tend to be simple and don&#x27;t require --lots-of-long-options --which-i-cant-ever-remember which GNU utils seem to really love :(<p>* The base system is being developed in a conservative way. We never reinstall servers for a major upgrade, we just upgrade running systems forever. We have some boxes that come from FreeBSD 6.0 (2005) and were gradually bumped up without reinstalling. There is little switching around of subsystems, so you don&#x27;t often have to learn replacements (like ipfwadm/ipchains/iptables). The OS is just a vehicle to me, please don&#x27;t complicate my life needlessly!<p>* The storage options are pretty nice. ZFS is now a common buzzword so I won&#x27;t go into it, also Linux is now getting a good replacement in btrfs. But I also like FreeBSD&#x27;s GEOM, which has a lot of &#x27;building blocks&#x27; that you can stack on eachother. For instance, you can use gmirror to create a RAID1 mirror, then use geli to create an encrypted volume on top of that.<p>* The ports/packages collection is a rolling release and generally has very new versions of apps from OpenJDK to Node to PHP etc. In my mind, it&#x27;s best to keep your app stack continuously fresh, compared with lagging and doing large upgrades every few years. That way you get security updates from the app authors constantly, instead of from maintainers who backport it. I actually prefer this, since upgrading apps creates tangible value for our developers and customers, but it&#x27;s a tradeoff. If you want to be hands-off, set-and-forget, no-budget-for-maintenance, then you might be better off with an Ubuntu LTS or RHEL strategy of locking apps into old versions with backported fixes. But damn, I cringe whenever I see a box with PHP 5.3...<p>* If you compile ports yourself, the port maintainers often create configurable options so you can build stuff with your own preferences. This is very useful for instance if you need ffmpeg with some specific codecs. It can be a real drag on Linux to get it just right. Creating your own binary package repository with your favorite custom options is super easy.<p>* We distribute that stuff like crazy (e.g. on appliances), and it&#x27;s nice to be able to do that without having too much fear about the GPL(v3).<p>That said, there&#x27;s some positive points about Linux (mostly Ubuntu/Debian here):<p>* Desktop support is undoubtedly better on Linux right now. FreeBSD desktops seem a bit like Linux desktops were in the &#x27;00s: manual twiddling, lots of tweaking, having to really watch what video and wireless hardware you get. PC-BSD should be better in this regard, but I haven&#x27;t tried BSD on the desktop for years now. But I&#x27;m tempted to give it another try.<p>* I think AppArmor is a really cool way to constrain applications without going the whole container way, for which FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t have an equivalent right now.<p>* While I&#x27;m skeptical about systemd&#x27;s overreaching goals, I do agree that it is time to centralize service and event management. It&#x27;s not a critical issue to me however, I&#x27;m not too bothered by the old inits for instance. So hopefully FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t have to have a big controversy and pick the &#x27;good parts&#x27;.<p>* Obviously Linux has a lot of momentum right now, so using it might be less of a long term risk in terms of support, hiring, etc.",1416679204

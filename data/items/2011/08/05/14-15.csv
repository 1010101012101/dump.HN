I have a Konica Minolta 2300 that does this, but there is a setting to let it keep printing even when the toner is empty. So when the colors run out, the black will keep printing until it is completely empty. There is no comparable setting for the drum. Once the machine has decided that the drum is finished, you can't print anymore.<p>It is worth noting that almost every printer I have installed in the last 20 years comes with the settings on 'best quality' which is code for 'use the most toner/ink'. You can often get much greater life and printing speed by changing the default settings to 'economy' or similar. Usually the only time you would notice a lack of quality would be when you print photographs. For the vast majority of printing that I do (office conditions) the quality difference is negligible.

A lot of programmers nowadays seem to religiously follow whatever new language is being hyped and try to fit their problems and tasks to the language instead of the other way around... a bit of critical thinking and seeing a bigger picture than ""thisandthat is THE SH*T (right now)!!"" would work wonders.<p>In the real world, real coders could not care less how god-like the latest scripting languages or NO-SQL-but-relax-data-maps are because chances are very good that my customers use Java and Oracle or a few other big names and since they are paying me, who am I to push religious plugs about the latest fads on them?<p>Bottom line is: real coders (should) just know enough about computers, hardware, software and networks to make educated decisions and guesses and typically they don't care that much which language they are getting paid to develop in... pretty much all languages ""suck"" in the way that they ALL have their short-comings and it is up to the engineer to understand them and work with them.",1312555808

I've done many public demonstrations which were mostly show performances, like in a Bruce Lee movie; but they don't resemble an actual fight in any way. I'm not sure if you're arguing that kata resemble a real fight, because that's even a step further than other posters are doing, but even assuming that you're just arguing that bunkai help one to visualize the potential circumstances the movements in kata can be used in, they're so stylized as to be completely irrelevant in real life.<p>I mean, all of you must have had karate teachers that would let you walk from one side of the gym to the other, doing straight punches, and taking take or proper foot placement, hip movement, fist height and position, etc? While the teacher walks around and corrects posture and style? All those hours you've done that (and I have, too) are completely useless from a 'learning to fight' point of view.

Boldwin and Levine state that Watt, like many inventors who obtain patents for inventions that were conceived by several people around the same time, was able to take advantage of the legal system because he was well connected. Watts' case illustrates a pattern that was to repeat itself endlessly: a moneyed inventor makes a minor modification to an existing design, and deploys his superior legal and financial resources to obtain a patent. Nice work if you can get it. James Watt spent more than half of his time litigating against other inventors with superior steam engine designs while he held the patent. When Watts' patent expired, he went into business consulting on steam engine operation--a business model similar to open source software consulting today. Marconi had the legal and financial resources to wrest the patent for radio from Tesla. Marconi's innovation was the addition of a ground wire. Tesla was posthumously awarded the patent by the US Supreme Court when Marconi's company sued the United States for the wartime use of radio.",1312555513

I agree that a trained karateka will have a significant advantage against an untrained opponent in any sort of fight.<p>That said, I disagree with the rest of your point. Naihanchi does not in any shape or form prepare one for any sort of fighting, be it on the ground or standing up. Of course when one does kumite 3 times a week, that <i>does</i> train one as a fighter, even if not maximally efficient; but it's far-fetched to say that because the movements of limbs in kumite sort of resemble the movements of limbs in a kata, that the kata adds significantly to the training for kumite-style competition (or 'actual' fighting, for that matter).<p>I also did not say that I was disappointed in my training. I got a lot out of it actually, and if I had more time I would still be training; but I no longer pretend that I learned effective fighting from it. I see it more as a fast paced yoga, and fun mix of medium-intensity cardio training and flexibility exercises. Which is fine. Also without actually doing it, I wouldn't have been able to draw the conclusions about its place in martial arts that I do now.<p>Finally, I'm not saying that the theoretical parts can't be fun, just like in the software cases that we started with. I have spend numerous hours toying with non-practical examples or test programs, for aesthetics or a minute performance enhancement or whatever. Similar in karate - I spend many hours in front of a mirror getting my side kicks perfectly level, for merely aesthetic reasons. Many people do - which is why I said the things I said, that the original goal has largely been forgotten. I mean seriously, kata competitions are seen as the 'noble' form of competitive karate, and kumite is just for youngsters with too much testosterone and roughnecks; does that make sense?",1312553560

There are tons of ""guitar"" players who would rather play by ear, learn a few chords, and start a band. Then there are those musicians that spend the time to learn the boring fundamentals.

We chose Quickbooks because it solved our remote access problem without diverting IT resources from focusing on our product, and we chose Quickbooks specifically because that's what the accounting staff were familiar with.<p>One of the best marketers I ever met told me that marketing was: ""...being the guy at the bottom of the hill selling shovels after an avalanche."" When he first said this, I thought it was silly. I thought he was just a rambling old man, but the more experience I've gained selling SaaS, the more I've realized he's right. It's such a simple concept that it's easy to overlook.<p>So how do you do this in practice?<p>First, you need a compelling reason for people to use your product. You have to know your customer and understand their pain points. Address as many as you can with your product. Then, make that fact known in your marketing material. Tell the story of how your product is going to take away that pain. Make sure that message is told up front.<p>Next up, you need to be ready at the bottom of the hill when the avalanche comes. This is probably the hardest part, and there are many different approaches. Advertising, direct sales, referral programs, affiliate programs, you name it. The key is, the user needs to literally stumble over your product at the moment they're ready to buy. To go back to the avalanche analogy, how hard do you think it is to sell a shovel to a man when he's standing neck deep in snow, and he turns around to see your shovel booth?<p>Based on this, let's have a look at your home page copy:<p>===========<p>[1] Professional Bookkeeping Software For Shopify Stores<p>[2]\n* Ready-to-use with no messy installations\n* Automatic inventory and sales tracking\n* Easy to use expense tracking<p>[3]\nFree plan available for single user. Only $9.95 a month per additional user. No contracts, no obligations, you can cancel anytime.<p>[4] Install Bodega Sale<p>[5] More Info<p>===========<p>The following critiques aren't empirical. I'm not necessarily saying you should make changes everywhere I point something out, but these are perspectives to consider. Many of the points will be balanced by counter points. You'll need to find the right balance in implementation.<p>1 - This H1 content appears to be well optimized for search terms. It does a good job of telling me what the software is, but doesn't really compel me to buy or show any connection to my needs.<p>2 - If I'm being brutally honest here, there is nothing about these items I find compelling. Unfortunately, I'm not a Shopify customer, so maybe inventory or sales tracking is a big pain point for Shopify customers, but that sounds like pretty basic functionality. Rule of thumb: never list features as a selling point. Tell a story that your customers will relate to. Do you use Shopify? Do you know lots of people who do? What challenges do they face? In their every day lives with Shopify, what tasks/problems do they have to slug their way through that you can alleviate. Identify those problems and tell the story in three short bullet points.<p>3 - There's nothing explicitly wrong with this last paragraph, but it sounds a bit like a last ditch effort to get someone on board. To break the paragraph down, you send three messages: free, cheap, leave any time. These points address a customer's resistance based on a sense of obligation, but they don't sell the product. I call these an ""at least you won't"" clause: ""Hey, you may not really need this product, but at least you won't have to stick with it if you don't like it."" This is never the strongest place from which to sell. If you're going to use the word free, use it as a hook to lead a user to the next step.<p>""Free plans available. See our complete list of plans and pricing.""<p>Where ""plans and pricing"" is a link to your detailed plans and pricing page.<p>4 - When I click this link, I'm hit with bold text that says, ""Starting at $9.95 a month."" What happened to the free plan I was promised? This is a major user trust issue, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's a major source of conversion failure. The byline ""This application offers a limited free trial period"" is smaller, low-contrast, and in italics, which makes it more difficult to read. This looks like the Shopify app store page, so you probably can't control these elements. Rather, I'd suggest you adjust your messaging on the other end to avoid providing a false expectation.<p>5 - Wall of features! Customers do want to know what your product contains, but right now, you're leaving it to them to figure out ""why"" they'd want your product. That's a risky position. You give them plenty of reason to say no. When you provide a user with a list of features, you invite them to review your product with their own internal checklist. Anything on their checklist that your product doesn't have is going to count against you. You have to provide the information, and some customers are going to give you the checklist treatment regardless, but you should provide as many compelling emotional reasons to buy as possible. This will give them a counter-reason to their failed expectation of <i>feature X</i>.<p>===End of critique.<p>Like I said, these are all my perspectives. Our company sells a SaaS financial tool (more procurement than accounting) with a heavy professional services component. We do business with some big name retailers and financial services firms, and we sold to them when everyone else was telling us we'd get no where chasing whales. I'm very lucky to work with a sales team that really understands how to relate to customer needs. That single aspect is the greatest lesson I've learned in this iteration of my career.",1312553502

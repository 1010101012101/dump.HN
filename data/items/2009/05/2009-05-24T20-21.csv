624661,comment,624580,624580,0,0,HSO,,,"At the risk of breaking the ""silence"" here (15 upvotes and no comment?!), let me add this:<p>""Less than three minutes after an event, we expect a world of talking heads to pronounce judgement on the meaning of what's transpired.""<p>We don't really expect it in the sense of wanting it. We expect it because we've been conditioned to instant noise on everything and now would find it creepy if something interesting (broadly defined) happened and there was silence. Reason is, all those media guys who want to draw our attention to sell their customers's products cannot survive on delivering Just the Facts, Ma'am. There are only so many known facts concerning any issue, and they are usually a little harder to come by than mere sentiment and opinion, wrapped in human interest drivel. I often imagine what a typical news article, even in a generally good paper like the Grey Lady, would look like if boiled down to just the facts. I'd die for a medium that gave me just the facts and remained silent when it was done delivering (or still in the process of hunting for) them.<p>As for the more personal connections, I routinely find people are genuinely annoyed or even take it personal when I turn my phone off or don't reply to email. I don't even have a Twitter account and just today shut down my FB page, but people do expect it -- even though they know I'm not the social type. Even harder to do in work environment where bossman or colleagues expect to be able to call you anytime. Sigh... Similar to the media, I often ask myself what they would say if they just gave or asked me actual information/content, without the whole yadayada wrapper. I think it's some sort of validate-my-existence/status/whatever thing but I ain't no psychologist, so...",1243197664

In other words, that babies got to grow without much hardwired control of their own bodies (and that includes thoughts) provided the opportunity for humans to grow into distinct behavioral patterns (i.e. exercise creativity), and to free themselves from what the genes predispose and then be open for what the culture demands and imprints.<p>Think about it: the ability to learn so much and about such breadth of subjects could, perhaps, have been made possible by the early birth imposed by pelvic changes related to upright walking.

The U.S. was a very young country and the differences between the states were relatively small (mostly white christians from Europe, speaking the same language).<p>In other countries, you can have two completely separate ethnic groups that look different, have separate languages and completely different religions. If you combine this with a history of territorial wars where one side has dominated the other, it's hard to let the war be over.<p>In contrast, there was not much difference between the U.S. states.

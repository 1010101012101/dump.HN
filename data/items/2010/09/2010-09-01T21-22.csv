I am convinced that when Apps Store become available, Boxee would be a fantastic app (and as such, would benefit from Apple as opposed to competing with Apple).  On the other hand, Boxee Box is a piece of hardware and would be a direct competitor and a strategic mistake (which explains why D-Link is dragging its feet).",1283377815

The crux of the argument, that ""[t]op aligned labels have proven to be faster and easier to fill out than left or right aligned labels"", is unsupported. The author supplies no links to research or other corroborating sources.<p>The graphic is a little misleading, too. Under ""Top aligned labels"", it says: ""less vertical space"". I initially understood that to mean that the form occupies less vertical space. It really means that the form leaves less vertical space below it.<p>I'm confused why they didn't consider other types of labels, especially for text boxes.

I normally wouldn't eat at a chain restaurant like that, but I was in Virginia and there was nothing nearby.<p>In any case, these college kids were sitting at the bar next to me, and we started talking.  They seemed to be friends with the bartender and one of the told me ""give the bartender a $20 and you'll drink all night for free.""  This was a Friday and I was stuck in VA for the weekend, with my hotel across the street so I was like, OK.  Anyway, I slipped the bartender a $20, and he proceeded to make all kinds of drinks for us.  He was using the top shelf liquor, not the well drink stuff, and he was making all kinds of custom martinis, shots, etc.  We literally finished well over $200 worth of drinks in the space of a few hours.  When the check arrived, it only had my meal on there, and all the drinks were missing.<p>Essentially, the bartenders gave us about $200 worth of drinks and we only paid for our meals, plus $20 each in tips (there were 4 of us).<p>If I owned that TGIFridays somewhere in VA, I'd be seriously worried about how much money my bartenders were stealing from me.  It is literally stealing when a bartender can make an extra $100-200 a night just by slipping free drinks to his friends.

Most debts are fixed in nominal terms, and the burden of debt could therefore be reduced, in real terms, with a bout of inflation. The Boomers tended to be anti-inflation because they remember the hyper-inflation of the 1970s, but neither Gen X nor Millenials remember the 1970s.<p>For the most part, a bout of strong of inflation could be regarded as a form of cheating, a form of welching on a debt. The public (at least in the US) hasn't favored that kind of policy, partly because I think a lot of people feel it would be unethical to get out of a debt that way. But then, avoiding unethical behavior depends on a notion of fairness, and that goes both ways. The Gen Xers and the Millenials might ask themselves, ""Was it fair for the Boomers to run up a few trillion in debt and then leave it to us?""

Intel probably just figured it was a way to hire people out of Stanford and Berkeley's engineering grad schools, and why on earth wouldn't you let someone do that?  Other people, the ones who saw the body shops at work (or were part of those heavily coerced ""knowledge transfer"" programs) couldn't understand why anyone was defending the program at all.<p>Honestly, I do think that this program played a substantial role in the erosion of interest in graduate level science and engineering people who grew up in the US - not because it allowed talented people to come here (that is a good thing), but because it was expanded to such a scale that it allowed companies to hire people at all levels of the talent spectrum at wages that weren't competitive with other options outside tech (law, medicine, MBA).<p>I think it was difficult to detect this at first, because there was of course some inertia (older Americans still in the field, takes a while for younger Americans to change their behavior and start avoiding sci/eng grad programs).  The problem is, there is inertia on the other side - if wages do improve, it'll take a long time for young Americans to respond the new market signals.<p>I hate this, because I had so many good friends in grad school who were from overseas, but it really disturbed me that kids who had grown up in California (or even the US) were almost totally absent from graduate engineering in a school called ""The University of California"").  The presence of international students is a great thing, but not when the levels of US citizens starts to drop to dangerous lows.  And while Grove and others described this as a kind of crisis, they never really connected it with wage erosion or potential displacement from the visa programs.<p>I think this is a hidden factor that will become far more pronounced when demand for engineers from Asia increases.  It's already happening, of course, but the US still gets to keep a lot of the talent that came here for grad school.<p>I think we should compete for this talent, of course, but I also think we should realize that will <i>will not</i> be a top tech power if we don't produce and sustain a healthy flow of engineering and science talent from our own population.  So far, this isn't controversial - the disagreement comes from the extent to which visa programs add rather than displace.",1283376060

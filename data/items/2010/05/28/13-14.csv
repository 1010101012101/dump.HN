He thought it would be nice to take a very long walk. He put on a little knapsack and he walked through Indiana and Kentucky and North Carolina and Georgia clear to Florida. He walked among farmers and mountain people, among the swamp people and fishermen. And everywhere people asked him why he was walking through the country.<p>Because he loved true things he tried to explain. He said he was nervous and besides he wanted to see the country, smell the ground and look at grass and birds and trees, to savor the country, and there was no other way to do it save on foot. And people didn’t like him for telling the truth. They scowled, or shook and tapped their heads, they laughed as though they knew it was a lie and they appreciated a liar. And some, afraid for their daughters or their pigs, told him to move on, to get going, just not to stop near their place if he knew what was good for him.<p>And so he stopped trying to tell the truth. He said he was doing it on a bet - that he stood to win a hundred dollars. Everyone liked him then and believed him. They asked him in to dinner and gave him a bed and they put lunches up for him and wished him good luck and thought he was a hell of a fine fellow. Doc still loved true things but he knew it was not a general love and it could be a very dangerous mistress.</i><p>I’m not walking because of love trouble. And lord knows I haven’t worked too hard. But the rest is right on. I’m anxious. I’m not sure what I’m doing with my life. I need an adventure. And I do want to smell the ground and look at grass and birds and trees.

1386389,comment,1384994,1386144,0,0,scottw,,,"I'm not talking about writing the ""clever code"" that nobody understands (including the coder 6 months afterward)—that's a symptom of the hubris-laden self-proclaimed intelligent programmer the original author is confused about. A genuinely intelligent programmer might early in his career write that esoteric crap as well, but soon learns that nobody—including himself—can understand it after a while. And that is the difference: the intelligent programmer stops doing that immediately while the pseudo-intelligent guy can't stop himself, worlds without end.<p>I've been in a variety of shops over the past 20 years or so where new kids come in, thinking they're all that and a bag of chips, and systematically replace smart, well-engineered, and <i>working</i> modules with their new ones that will now take years to become as robust, and never be half as elegant.<p>They do this because they won't take an afternoon to spend the time to read and understand the original code.<p>Intelligence isn't wholly a matter of genetics—some of these earnest kids do eventually learn better in spite of their natures. They spend enough time with the real good guys to figure out they're not one of them, and then they start trying to figure out why. The fakes go on for years and years writing the worst stuff imaginable and <i>even after shown direct evidence of their incompetency</i> will refuse to reclassify themselves. They start getting defensive, paranoid, thinking they're the poor misunderstood artist.

1386359,comment,1384485,1384843,0,0,vaporstun,,,"I'll give you a few examples. I was an iPhone user for 2.5 years and switched to an Android phone a month and a half ago. (thank you Google I/O!)<p>First, there are 2 calendar apps and 2 email apps. One calendar app is just called ""calendar"" and the other is called ""corporate calendar"" I think the idea is to have the exchange calendar in one app and the regular one in the other. But this is unnecessarily complicated. Why not just one calendar app like the iPhone which has all calendar events? Likewise, there is an Email app for any non-Google accounts, then GMail. So when I get an email, it may open in either app which have a completely different look and feel. While that's mostly fine for a geek like myself, it is confusing to any normal users and is a UI mess.<p>And there are many other things throughout the interface which lack polish. The phone app, for example. When in a call, my fiancee accidentally hit the home button. She then went into the phone app to get back to the call because she had to enter things on the dialpad to continue. (she was on the phone with a 1-800 number's automated system) So she went back to the phone app to get back to the call. But that opened to the call log. So she went to the dialpad and tried entering the numbers like she was told, but that dialpad is the dialpad for initiating a new call, not for the current one, so it didn't work. The system timed out and she had to make a new call again. For reference, the way you're supposed to do it is to pull down the notification bar where to get back to the current call.<p>In contrast, on the iPhone when you hit the home button, there is a green strip across the top of the screen that says ""Return to current call"" so it is trivially easy, and if you go back to the phone app in the middle of the call, it takes you right back to the current call.<p>While on the phone app, when an incoming call comes in on it is difficult to figure out how to merge calls or hang one up and answer the other. To be honest, I still haven't figured it out yet. On the iPhone, the call comes and it has 3 big buttons: Hold current call and answer, Merge calls, End current call and answer. Trivially simple, good UI.<p>Other things, the Android virtual keyboard SUCKS compared to the iPhone. It's predictive text is just not as good and my typing speed has been cut in half with this device because it fails so often.<p>The gallery app, while flashy and 3D is slow and laggy, and I yearn for the simplicity of the iPhone gallery. I don't need my pictures flying around in 3D if it detracts from usability with performance issues.<p>Often on my Droid, I hit the home button and all I see is my background. I often have to wait a few seconds for my shortcut icons to load, then a few more for my widgets to load and refresh. It's terribly frustrating. And sometimes they don't all load, I just have to swipe on the screen to get it to work. I shouldn't have to wait for my home screen to load.<p>Mobile Safari is just a much nicer browsing experience than the Android browser. I've even tried Dolphin, but find it leaves a bit to be desired. It is just not as good at zooming, panning, etc. as Mobile Safari which is HUGE for a browser on a smartphone. With so little screen real estate, I don't want to spend my time frustrated with that aspect of the browser.<p>Overall, the OS just feels sluggish in nearly every way. I don't know how to quantify it, but everything is less smooth and responsive. It's sad that my 2 year old iPhone 3G feels faster and more responsive most of the time than my new Droid. I even tried overclocking the thing to 1GHz and it still felt like a dog compared to the iPhone. And it is almost certainly all software because the processor in the newer Droid is certainly faster than the iPhone 3G, especially when overclocked. But it still felt slower.<p>Overall, there are many more little UI problems all throughout Android which make it far more frustrating to use. I don't hate it entirely, I wouldn't have switched if I did, but it is annoying and I am willing to live with it because of a) Verizon and b) the Hackability. But I'm a big geek, I simply would not recommend an Android phone to most of my family/friends and that is a big problem.",1275054080

It's called the pro-aging trance. If we were hit by a baseball bat on the head every week and there was nothing we could do, over time we would also rationalize why it's good. But if you were to ask someone who had never been hit on the head if he wanted too, he would say no. In the same way, if you asked someone who biologically stayed with the body of a 25 years old if he wanted to get frail, he would say no. As soon as someone proves that the diseases of aging aren't inevitable (say, by making a mouse live in good health for 10x the normal lifespan), the pro-aging transe will be broken. Listen to the part about the pro-aging transe here: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_ag...</a><p>Your body is already repairing most of the damage of aging and replacing most of your cells over time. It's just that there are certain kinds of damage that we haven't evolved to repair, and over time they add up. Past certain thresholds they cause pathologies, and we get frail, suffer and die. But if we can periodically repair that damage (without the need to understand all of metabolism, just the damage), we can avoid ever getting close to these thresholds.<p>> Again, what makes you so sure it's in our best interest?<p>Not being killed by an asteroid or a supervolcano is pretty obviously in our best interest, as well as not dying from cancer or alzheimers. If I put a gun to your daughter's or your fiancee's head, you'd feel it. But if I say ""all of humanity could die"" (which include your daughter and your fiancee), you suffer from scale insensitivity and don't care nearly as much even if it's a much more terrible fate (all the things about which humans care about would be gone).",1275053724

The fact is that not everyone can know every bug in IE6, and though it's not too hard to avoid the big well-known issues, you may end up cutting design and interactive features or write a lot of ugly workarounds to deliver comparatively simple features.  Additionally there are many subtle issues which become exponentially difficult to debug and isolate because the environment is so utterly opaque (admittedly I haven't tried Microsoft's commercial tools which I've heard actually have some utility, but I'll be damned before I pay a Microsoft tax just to debug for their hopeless broken software).<p>Firebug bugs are easier to deal with because there is more information and controls with which to isolate bugs.

We have the (beta) product, we have a decent trickle of customers, and we have a few VCs swimming around us and showing some interest.<p>Problem is, I'm a techie, not a business guy. I have an MBA, but acquired it LOOOOONG ago (think 15 years) and really haven't used it since opting for a career in software development. Now, I'm expected to meet with VCs and be able to talk the talk, and I need help.<p>I'm looking for a book (or books) that will make me sound like a seasoned startup guy. I consider myself reasonably intelligent and pick up concepts quickly, and I'm sure at some point the MBA courses from the past will start to seep back into my aging brain.<p>Is there a reading list that will prepare me? Time is short (hopefully!).<p>Thanks!",1275051965

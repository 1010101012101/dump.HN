I mean, is it so important for a web start-up called ""yourbooks"" to own ""yourbooks.com""?<p>It seems to me that decisions as important as selecting a product name are often being made on the availability of domain names. I think this doesn't make sense - most people will use Google if they're looking you up on the web, and apps are the dominate delivery channel, so who cares?<p>Focus on your business idea, not some arbitrary domain name issue... the world does not need another urbkly.com or another $100k ransom for a domain name.",1368529149

5704043,comment,5701396,5703257,2,0,sfrank,,,"Sure you can do however, since Ruby allows destructive updates, why not use one of the established/traditional imperative  data structures and then apply techniques to make them ""persistent"" (i.e. immutable in the functional programming sense as is also used by Okasaki and of course not using the trivial technique of copying the whole thing). Such techniques are e.g. presented in CLRS if I remember correctly.<p>It is not that Okasaki was the first one to implement any functional data structure. People have been doing this before and also in purely functional languages such as Haskell, ML, or Opal). He was the first to give a very nice overview, showed some new designs and even more important, showed a way for time complexity analysis (in a lazy evaluation context).<p>And it is this last part of the thesis that many people overlook: the importance of lazy evaluation (and thus the implied fundamental optimizations/evaluations performed by the compiler/runtime) for most of the presented data structures (i.e. everything with an amortized time complexity). Simply implementing Queues as presented in  the thesis and not having a lazy language will lead to a very different time complexity than is proven there, because lazy semantics is vital for the given complexity analysis.<p>This is also the reason, why e.g. Clojure (or Opal from the early 90s, [1]) use other data structures to ensure functional (i.e. persistent) semantics in an eager/strict evaluation model.<p>[1] 1994, <a href=""http://projects.uebb.tu-berlin.de/opal/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Papers/DesignImplOpal.ps.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.uebb.tu-berlin.de/opal/trac/raw-attachment/w...</a>",1368528971

I'm better off saying I don't want to turn a blind eye any longer. I've had this sickness for about 7 years now, and to be honest, I fucking hate it. My illness you ask? It's called procrastination.<p>I'm 100% sure I'm not the only person on HN that has this disease, which is the reason why I'm posting this. But you know what? I've had enough of this shit. I really can't continue living this way, it's eating away my brain, it's destroying me. I always help other people over working on my projects. I leave bills, when I have the cash to pay it. I leave everything to the last moment, and beyond. Why? I really don't have a fucking clue, probably because it's easy, but I've realised I need to get my shit together.<p>It's fucking fun to produce stuff that I want to produce. I rarely finish a product however. I miss the strong sense of confidence that it would come with being on top of things. I need to get this feeling, so I'll never even consider procrastinate again. At the moment, I choose the opposite.<p>I need to get off my ass and get cracking. But that's a skill, and at the moment I just suck at it. There is absolutely no reason I can't change that. I need to consciously practice motivating myself using some kind of structured technique and if I do that enough I WILL learn it as a habit. I will fucking LEARN it. From conscious effort where I'd reeeeally have to try, to conscious effort where I kind of have the hang of it, to unconsciously doing it sometimes, all the way up to not thinking about it whatsoever.<p>I am sick, but enough is enough.<p>Ps. This is a throwaway account. I wonder how many people here identify themselves with this, or have battled this in the past. Tips are more than welcome!",1368528855

Remember how we got in this mess in the first place:<p>Depends what you mean by 'this mess' if this mess is a high level of debt without the productive economic activities to service it, I'd suggest that it was by spending too much on things that didn't provide a return on investment.<p>>They will effectively create the money fractional reserve banking and such.<p>No, that is not fractional reserve banking, in fact what would happen if they did just print more money?  Lets pretend they could do it without breaking away from the euro.  Inflation would rise sharply?   Would that lead to a better economic situation?  Some people say it does, hence the UKs policy on QE.<p>>If we had borrowed from our central bank instead of Rothschild&co, our current debt would have been only 20% of what it is now well, assuming we didn't borrow even more.<p>That is just a gross oversimplification, and really Rothschild&co?  What are we, angry I learnt economics from youtube socialists?<p>>start borrowing from the central banks at nearly 0% instead.<p>Historically, this action hasn't worked well.  Ultimately they have debt obligations as is, they need to settle that with something, where would that something come from?  They could deflate the debt, which would be the effect of creating a synthetic entity which would loan at 0%.  To deflate this much debt would seriously hurt people.  They could potentially try and bond default, Russia kinda got away with it (some people say it was a good idea), but then Argentina really showed the problems that can happen doing this.<p>This is why people come down to taxation and spending, ultimately they are the only options, because any kind of inflationary policy is a cruel tax, as it is often felt more by the poorest, due to the commodities which tend to rise.  Meanwhile the super rich can make money of the back of it and even increase their worth leveraged thanks to the inflation bonds and the like.",1368526172

On the other hand, allies of the US, like my country, seem to bend over backwards to accommodate US demands, reasonable or otherwise. So, you can sort of see the point of supporting a tyrant, or strong government.<p>Also, didn't Bush threaten democratic Pakistan with a bombing back to the stone age if it didn't comply with US demands? Which strikes me as being a bit tyrannical.<p>I have to say that the idea that the US is the only thing stopping war and / or world war is arrogant and insulting, or just laughable, in the extreme. The rest of us are not savages on the verge of war, and we are capable of negotiating before knee jerking to shock and awe, torture, drone assassinations and Tom Clancy special forces TV events.<p>Ultimately, Im saying its more complicated than US good and those lot are tyrants, or terrorists.<p>But what bothers me more than any thing else though, is the sheer contempt and paranoia which which the US government treats it own people. It blows my mind that on one hand it's all ""USA, USA, USA"" (BTW, do Americans know how awful that looks? I, perhaps in my ignorance, only know two countries with a national chant. One lost WW2), while at the same time the US gov takes away their freedoms. The reason it bothers me is that at some point there has to be a tipping point where Americans have had enough, and I'm not sure a vote will solve it.

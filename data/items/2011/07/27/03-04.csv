2810690,comment,2807796,2807796,1,0,kamaal,,,"While we analyze why there isn't much gender diversity as it is before. We must also understand how much the industry has changed over years. The volume of work that existed back in the pre - 80's era and now isn't even comparable. And with volume the culture of our profession has changed drastically.<p>If its your usual 9-5 job, where you have to apply routine steps everyday then it would have been OK. But being progressive in programming requires you not just to work hard(And in most cases working under difficult deadlines and overnight) you also have continuously keep learning and update yourself with things that come along everyday. This is pretty demanding if you have a family, kids and especially when you are pregnant etc. There are physical limitations in those issues. If I look at the way my career has been, I sort of had to stay and overnights and work on difficult deadlines many times over long periods. It becomes very difficult for a mother with kids to accommodate work and family in that kind of schedule. So she has to often opt to be one side. A general counter point presented to this argument is to ask the Project manager to be more come with a more accommodating plan.This is often not possible due to economic reasons, given the time, money and resource something needs to be delivered. This has nothing to do with male domination in the society, these are just unavoidable situations.<p>This is typical of many other professions. Why don't we find as many female cab drivers as male ones? Why don't we have as many frontline female soldiers/nurses?<p>Let alone all that, if the current biological situation was reversed. And men could stay at home(Do the house choses, kids, food etc) and women had to take all responsibilities of house, family, money and security for their whole life. How many women in mass(not individual cases) would be happy with such a tiring and demanding life?<p>Well I guess everything in the nature and the way things go have a purpose.",1311739073

The internal projections have been closely held, but several people have confirmed that the goal was to amass 300,000 online subscribers within a year of launch. On Thursday, the company announced that after just four months, 224,000 users were paying for access to the paper’s website. Combined with the 57,000 Kindle and Nook readers who were paying for subscriptions and the roughly 100,000 users whose digital access was sponsored by Ford’s Lincoln division, that meant the paper had monetized close to 400,000 online users.

That is, I believe it does a better job of what WSGI was intended to do.<p>I understand your point that web developers don't necessarily work with WSGI on a day-to-day basis.  But if you look at the Ruby web community, Rack middlewares are much more prevalent than WSGI middlewares.  Application developers (as opposed to framework developers) often add functionality as a Rack middleware, so that it can be reused in different applications, even using different frameworks.  Why isn't that happening with Python as much?  In the Python world, instead of writing even simple middlewares to for basic functionality like <a href=""https://github.com/adeel/pump/blob/master/pump/middleware/params.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adeel/pump/blob/master/pump/middleware/pa...</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/adeel/pump/blob/master/pump/middleware/cookies.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adeel/pump/blob/master/pump/middleware/co...</a>, every framework ends up reimplementing it.

Our latest epicycle is competitive job postings. This at least is laudably specific; most of these kinds of explanations aren't testable at all.<p>The obvious but taboo answer is that women will generally gravitate to fields which are more social/people focused and less technical/mathematical.

To learn to program you have to spend a LOT of time focused on a computer taking in technical information. After you have acquired a certain amount of technical knowledge you can then program a utility. I wouldn't put this in the same boat as an artistic pursuit as the mode of acquiring information is different.<p>Once you have learnt sufficient computer knowledge then yes, you can work in a team, but the learning process requires a lot of time alone, while also having a technical aptitude. From my experience, from my friends, the girls who like to spend time alone are artists (painters/writers whatever) and the girls who have technical aptitude are scientists or in the medical profession. It really is my belief that if we want more women in computing it has to become less of an isolated pursuit - I'd like to see other suggestions but I've yet to find any other solution.<p>If you're a woman and reading this I'd really love to have some feedback from how you've found computing as a profession.

That is, I believe it does a better job of what WSGI was intended to do.<p>I understand your point that web developers don't necessarily work with WSGI on a day-to-day basis.  But if you look at the Ruby web community, Rack middlewares are much more prevalent than WSGI middlewares.  Application developers (as opposed to framework developers) often add functionality as a Rack middleware, so that it can be reused in different applications, even using different frameworks.  Why isn't that happening with Python as much?  In the Python world, instead of writing even simple middlewares to for basic functionality like <a href=""https://github.com/adeel/pump/blob/master/pump/middleware/params.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adeel/pump/blob/master/pump/middleware/pa...</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/adeel/pump/blob/master/pump/middleware/cookies.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adeel/pump/blob/master/pump/middleware/co...</a>, every framework ends up reimplementing it.  I believe this is because the WSGI API is ugly and not as easy to understand as it could be (just look at the average WSGI middleware).",1311735937
2810560,comment,2810373,2810373,56,0,justin_vanw,,,"""What WSGI should have been.""<p>Well, not at all.  Pump is what werkzeug, webob, and other more friendly wrappers on WSGI already are.  Basically pointless duplication of work, without understanding why WSGI can't be this simple.<p>One basic reason that WSGI can't be as simple as just returning a dictionary is that you don't necessarily want the entire body of your response pre-computed before starting to return data to the client.  What about long running connections?  What if you want to return the head of the response immediately, so the client can start pulling css and js while you compute the body of the response?  What if you want to do chunked encoding to support long polling connections, or responses where you don't know the response size beforehand?<p>Pump is basically doing what lots of other things already do, except without quite understanding HTTP quite as well.",1311735911
2810559,comment,2810373,2810503,6,0,ianb,,,"Yes, but IMHO servlets got it all wrong, and WSGI took very little from servlets (though for instance Webware, a pre-WSGI framework did use the servlet model). But it owes much to the superior CGI model; replace processes with function calls and structure the response lightly and you have WSGI.",1311735825

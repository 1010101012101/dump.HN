4569848,comment,4567735,4569492,9,0,junto,,,"I often find the idea of ""maturity"" an interesting concept. We have a fairly fixed average lifetime expectancy, which can vary by a couple of years depending on where you live (on average). I think the global average is 68 years old for both sexes.<p>The western world has an fairly fixed period of ""maturing"" into adulthood, which is usually achieved when the individual reaches 18 years old. Most countries then offer the vote and other ""adult"" related perks and responsibilities. Meanwhile, adults are living longer and social and health support costs for those people in retirement is increasing and this burden falls on the working population.<p>Historically humans have matured before 18 years old. This shift has happened over the last two centuries (western world). However, let's not forget that in many parts of the world, children start work and start families at a much younger age and it is socially acceptable within their own societies. These are concepts that we in the western world find (now) quite bizarre, but during the (British) industrial revolution, children (and we had a lot of them) helped to power the revolution, working in mines and factories. These children had children younger and further increased the population at a more rapid growth rate. We now look on this with distaste, disgust and a large degree of pity, but at the time I doubt it was viewed as so.<p>I would go further and state that today we see this as slavery, whilst back then they saw it as necessity. This necessity still exists around the world, and even though there is a huge drive in the western world to boycott companies in the third and second world who use child labor, it is an important source of income for their families living in poverty. Importantly and all to often forgotten, we are too blinded by our indignation to see otherwise. I'm not saying that this is right, merely making an observation.<p>Meanwhile our welfare states are collapsing and we have few options. We have to reduce our social support costs or see our support systems collapse. Alternatively we could import human resource from abroad to pay the taxes to support welfare. Importing labor is not without its own challenges, but has helped to build countries like the United States into global powerhouses.<p>Without a doubt, we need to extend people's working lives (i.e. later retirement), which is for many countries, especially in Europe, the first step on this path. The ""lord taketh and the lord taketh away"", but woe betide the state that tries to take anything away from its citizens. Countries like France are being brought to their knees by this welfare burden. The people protest in their millions as they see banks profit and get richer, but nothing will change, except for the fact that eventually, the French will have to accept later retirement and higher taxes.<p>Thus, the question I put to you is this: Do our children really need 18 years to mature, or is our system taking 18 years to mature them? Are we able to improve the system so that we can increase the number of workers in the system from the bottom up, rather than the top down?<p>We could radically change the way (and speed) in which we educate our children (and have more of them) to help offset the welfare gap from the bottom up. I haven't ever heard this idea proposed and the devil's advocate in me wants to question why not?<p>I have children and I want the best for them. On one hand I want them to enjoy their ""extended"" childhood, but I also want them not to suffer in poverty when they get older. The pragmatist in me thinks that there is little option other than consider extending the worker's life from both sides.<p>To summarize, the baby boomers fucked us and we and our children just have to live with the consequences.",1348574317

Hanson[1] suggests Americans already buy too much healthcare, and in the US, healthcare still costs most people something through copays, etc.  So, I think it's quite arguable that giving people free healthcare can create bad incentives, if not limited some other way.<p>I also am not sure it makes sense to lump together healthcare (which includes a lot of long-term preventative care like vaccines and lifestyle advice) and fire protection (which is mostly emergency damage control).  A better analogy might be if the government provided free fire insurance covering everything citizens own -- actually, the US does this sort of thing with hurricanes and floods, so there's a fairly exact analogy, and it seems clear that it <i>does</i> create bad incentives to build and rebuild in hurricane-prone and low-lying areas.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/CutMed.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanson.gmu.edu/CutMed.htm</a>",1348574279

- Free education 
- Free roads and parks
- Free safety and security (i.e. a relatively well functioning police force that will protect me from violence)<p>These entitlements are far from perfect, and come with the caveat that if and when I start earning money, some of it will be taken from me (by threat of force, if necessary) to go into a communal fund to provide other Australians with these benefits.<p>That sucks a bit, but on the other hand I have a legal right to decide, along with other citizens, on the proportion of my income that is taken, as well as on the people in charge of managing these communal funds.<p>Perhaps more importantly, I get to live in a society where other people get these things too. I'm not saying this from a touchy-feely standpoint - there are huge benefits to the individual living in such a system.<p>Because virtually everyone in my country has food in their stomach, a roof over their head, and a shot at improving their situation through hard work, I rarely feel unsafe.

And so I have the flexibility to schedule all of my work as is convenient.<p>Internally I am figuring out that it requires X hours work for each milestone - but the client never sees this, they just see my quoted figure and the delivery date. But I have found that this way I can up my rates significantly - I suspect because clients are measuring cost in terms of deliverables, rather than hourly or daily rate.<p>I spent a lot of time working up my rate from 40/hr (three years ago) to 100/hr through various mechanisms. But I have struggled to breach that barrier for a while now. My ultimate aim is 200/hr (which, as a full-stack engineer with years of experience & happy clients, is what I think my time is worth). This new method is currently ""testing"" at around 120/hr and I am slowly increasing it, without issue so far.<p>This also helps for existing clients too; if you start working with someone at 40/hr it's hard to build your rate up significantly without putting them off [I lost a very solid client on the jump from 60 - 100]. But if clients don't <i>know</i> your rates, upping them by 10/hr will be much less visible, and they only have to judge whether the total cost is worth the outcome.<p>So, I think I would be happy in saying - your theory is sound, and seems to be working out for me in practice :)",1348573487

That convergence, along with civilian drones, will expand and improve our options for transport immensely, while also improving efficiency dramatically.  It's still a long way to go, but the technologies to make it happen exists today.  It's going to be more of an infrastructure change, for example to provide specially marked routes and stopping points for self driving vehicles.  The benefits of implementing this is going to take a while for people to realise, but doing so will be comparable or cheaper than current mass transit projects, while offering significantly more flexibility regarding routes and capacity.  It will allow people to improve the mobility they have with their own cars now, while improving efficiency so people can live better in and around bigger cities.<p>For example, instead of bus routes, you can have a car come to pick you up at or near home at a scheduled time, or on demand, to take you to the train station to make a scheduled train on time.  When the train arrives in the city you can have a similar car take you to the office.  The cars can manage stopping to recharge by itself.  The car routes can be updated and optimised based on demand or congestion, new routes can be added easier than bus routes.  Software can manage your individual trips so you only have to make decisions based on time and cost.  Deliveries can be done with automated cars and flying drones, and this can be adapted much quicker based on demand.",1348570936

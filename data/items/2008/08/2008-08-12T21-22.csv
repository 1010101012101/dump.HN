274513,comment,274381,274381,0,0,Chocobean,,,"So, Mr Sink says that there are ""so many products under the Eee name that soon the brand will be meaningless."" He had one reason, but he didn't bother telling us why that may be true.<p>His only reason was this : there are so many offerings of Eee, the <i>product version</i> or <i>model</i> is unclear and non-specific. As a result, he claims, the brand will become meaningless and die. It is true that ""I have an Eee"" is as vague as ""I have a game console"" or, closer to home: ""I have a laptop"". But meaningless and dying? Historical evidence suggests otherwise.<p>The phrase ""I have a DS"" doesn't tell you if I have an ugly grey brick-shaped plastic or a beautiful, smooth and colourful piece of art; but it tells you I have a gaming console, speficially, one not made by Sony.<p>The iPod comes in nearly as many different offerings: iPod Classic, iPod Touch, iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, multiplied by many different version numbers. But I think we can all agree that iPod as a brand is not going to go anywhere, and is certainly not meaningless in the marketing world.<p>Perhaps Asus isn't trying to make Eee stand out as a single product, but rather an entire <i>product series</i>, or perhaps even an entire category all on its own. It is not a ""Laptop model number Eee 701 made by company x"", but ""an Eee"". This is the true power of branding, when your brand is so successful that the average person refers to your product not by what it is, but by its very name.<p>If I tell you I drive a Porche, I am not being specific about what kind of car I'm driving, but to some people, what I have suggested matters more than if it's red or an SUV or brand new.",1218577856

274500,comment,273240,273510,0,0,lsc,,,"changing the process is exactly what I am talking about here... not so much changing, though, as creating.  Usually, when you tell a SysAdmin to do something (install a server, remove a server, etc...)  she just does it.  I mean, most of this is pretty simple stuff.  my suggestion is that when you see a mistake of inattention, you add process so the problem does not occur a second time.  set up a checklist for that process, or as in the power cord example, change your process for installing new servers.<p>the alternate is to just fire people when they make dumb mistakes... but for me, that is unjustifiably expensive, especially when compared with the cost of adding process.<p><pre><code>  Sure, if you control the app you can set things up such that losing one physical server isn't a problem, but that is usually a lot more expensive than a few zipties.  One thing I've learned in my years as a computer janitor is that a fix I can put in place now with materials I have on hand gets done.  A fix I suggest to the devs, even if they agree it is a good idea, rarely gets done.
</code></pre>
Process, when it includes humans, is bureaucracy.  And yeah, you need to make sure it doesn't get ridiculous, however, having a checklist for, say, installing a server, or replacing a bad disk is still, I believe, in the realm of 'good bureaucracy.'  When you get paged at 4am after a late party, you can't count on being sharp and remembering everything.  You have to accept that especially for emergency maintenance, sometimes your admins are not at 100%.<p>you also need to accept that things you don't expect will happen.  You can't always rely on process.   I'm just saying that you can use process to avoid making the same mistake twice.",1218576651

You can have a collectivist democracy, like Japan, or an individualist dictatorship, like Saddam's Iraq or Nazi Germany.<p>China's recent economic improvements have nothing to do with its collectivism. They're due to more freedom, both economic and personal, for its citizens. Taiwan, whose people are arguably very similar to the Chinese in cultural outlook, started prospering as they emerged from martial law under the Kuomintang to democracy. Hopefully China will follow the same path as Taiwan and South Korea in this respect.<p>I get the sense that Brooks wants to prove that dictatorships are just as morally legitimate as democracies, and that the people of Asia (or the Middle East, or wherever) are somehow culturally programmed to thrive under a dictatorship. He's got it backwards -- the people thrive not because of the dictatorship, but in spite of it. Once they're freed, they'll thrive all the more.",1218575921

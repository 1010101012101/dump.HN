1264631,comment,1263291,1263291,0,0,Zak,,,"Apple's troubles in the mid '90s were not the fault of third-party developers. Windows NT <i>was</i> a better OS than classic Mac OS (and I was a Mac guy at the time). Macs of the day were uninspired and expensive. The recent switch to PowerPC had caused issues with a number of applications; most still worked, but it wasn't exactly fast. The phased introduction of PowerPC meant a lot of people considering new Macs waited, and some jumped ship.<p>Apple's recovery didn't have anything to do with playing hardball with developers. Apple recovered because it started making better products. Apple can retain its position in the smartphone market by continuing to make the best product. All they'll get from acting like a bully is ill will.",1271242300

Even among java programmers, a miniscule fall that brought it a tiny bit below another language that isn't generally used for the same things as Java is totally unimportant.

Not to a level of mastering all the underlying concepts, but to the level of becoming functional with it. In an ideal world, we don't feel the urge to hide something we think the user will not understand. Instead, in an ideal world, we <i>teach</i> the user. Be it by presenting the subject in ways the underlying concepts become clear and obvious, be it in showing them progressive levels of functionality and abstraction. In an ideal world, users are intelligent, curious and do not feel the urge to run away from things, they feel, are too complex for them.<p>It's disturbing when someone advocates the idea of dumbing down what is a powerful idea in order not to upset those who think they would be upset, preventing them from learning something useful.<p>I use URLs for many things, from describing database connections to navigating hierarchical datasets in data-driven visualization tools. There is a lot to it beyond HTTP.<p>The Internet is not a blue ""e"". It's not a place of consumption, but one of sharing.<p>And when it becomes distributed, like you say, URLs could really serve us well, not by mapping to server:port/folder/document.html but to content and letting the underlying, non-http protocols, work out what's the best place to get the resource you need. You say ""in the future"" but p2p file-sharing networks use URLs in the form of network://hash-to-what-you-want.<p>If you assume your users are stupid, not only will you limit you product to those who know little, but you will rob them the possibility of learning something.",1271241146

Those things are no small achievement.  Of course the Twitter guys should be proud of that and I don't mean to disparage that in any way.  It puts them in very good company.<p>However Facebook has gone an extra several orders of magnitude to bring them into the league of the Amazons and Googles.  Two things Facebook has done are A) develop a business leadership that can reinvent the whole product every 6 months and actually continue to grow wildly as a result of these radical tactical shifts and (even more impressively) B) an engineering team that can keep up with this and deal with scalability profiles that make Google look like child's play all the while pushing code to production on a daily basis as if they were some kind of garage startup.<p>Twitter on the other hand took <i>years</i> to build a small team that was capable of scaling the existing minimalistic application, and what do they have now?  A simple application and API that is somewhat mainstream, but also with only 1% of the hooks and stickiness that Facebook has established.<p>I don't even particularly like Facebook, I think it's a waste of time and that Mark Zuckerberg probably would have no moral qualms about reducing the entire world productivity down to a trickle by means of viral Zynga-style brain-crap. However I have to admit that there's always some hook that brings me back into Facebook (oh I gotta see so-and-so's photos or I'll just use Facebook Connect to log into this site because it's easy).<p>For Twitter to get there they need to figure out how to get past the geeky niche users, the vapid celebrities, and the huckster marketeers to find something wildly compelling to people.  140-characters is a nice idea, but it's not the kind of idea that's easy to make essential to people.

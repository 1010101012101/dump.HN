When we design websites (and privacy policies...) we need to remember this.<p>Remember: for a normal person, those somewhat scary-looking URLs are likely opaque. To the extent that people spend any time pulling them apart, it turns into a game of ""guess the really long number, by hand, typing attempts into the URL bar of their web browser"".

I am not ready to reveal it to the whole wide world as it's still not a clean prototype. Unless the project has a team that is committed to it, at this point, it's best to go stealth.""<p>I don't think that would be a problem. Realistically, for 99% of startups at your stage, the risk of damaging the business through <i>overexposure</i> is negligible. <i>Underexposure</i> should be a bigger worry. Getting people to pay attention to your product is hard. It won't happen accidentally, so I see no real risk in posting links in select places such as this thread.<p>It's certainly your prerogative to stay in stealth mode and continue looking for a cofouder without linking to your prototype. And if you go that route, I sincerely wish you the best of luck. But I think you're unnecessarily creating extra barriers for yourself.<p>Like I said before, there are a ton of people looking for technical cofounders. And there aren't many developers who 1) would be interested in founding a company, and 2) choose not to found a company of their own. So the competition is fierce. You have an advantage in that you can already show a prototype. This lets potential cofounders know you're for real, and that you can get things done. Wasting that competitive advantage seems a shame.<p>And practically speaking, what do you have to lose?

The former means that there is a limit, and it is low and they don't want to tell you what it is. The latter means that their service is so crappy, the only way they can keep you is by legally obligating you to keep paying them.<p>We've seen this with ""unlimited"" web hosting: practically it means that you can only store a certain amount of data and only have so much bandwidth, and when you start ""abusing"" the service, you get booted. Calling it ""unlimited"" gives the provider a license to change the rules whenever it sees fit.<p>I welcome data caps and limits. If AT&T tells me I can only use 2GB of data and at what speed I can make an informed decision on whether to go with their offering or not. I would like to see the limits be more near a 20-30 GB mark as that is my usage, but that is better than ""unlimited, but if you do something we don't like we limit you"". Please, if you run any kind of service, put a limit on it an make sure you can meet the demand, unless the resource is not constrained on your part in any practical sense. For example, I say ""unlimited email notifications"" on Ping Brigade, but there is no real constraint in place. However, I put a hard limit on how many services/servers you can monitor because I know the limits of my system and I have planned for capacity (and have a plan to expand the capacity if all of a sudden the service gets popular).<p>Contrast that with AT&T, who sold first and build the service later.

More so, almost certainly the average user has such low expectations of windows reliability that if they see the system become unstable or slow after a long period of uptime they will as a rule merely reboot the system rather than investigate.<p>Edit: a thought occurs to me.

Given that it failed on Feb 29, either the library is weak, used wrongly, or no such library had been in use.

In either case, I can imagine that code that assumes that Feburary has 28 days may go havoc on the 29th. For example, before midnight you might want to schedule some important task two hours from now, do calculations based on the number of seconds in two hours and calculate the task to happen on March 1st instead of February 29th.<p>I think the issue arises because even though time is such an important (and difficult to handle) data point, there is hardly any language support or the libraries are weak.",1330633844

He has the ability to make people self-conscious about their own mistakes with the least effort, as he does nothing but listen.<p>However, when it's time for him to talk, he talks little and observes the reactions. This gives him an aura of being very, very wise, which is absolutely correct (I work in research and he's a big fish)<p>Sorry, I'm moving away from the article's point, let's get back to the track. Splurting and dismissing ideas is good for brainstorms, but not for regular meetings. As an engineer, this is hard to percieve, but it's true.

I said that invoking ""inherent moral rights"" to defend a very artificial compromise like copyright is a losing game.<p>I outright said, ""I'm not arguing against copyright."" I definitely think copyright is a kludge, no two ways about it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't serve a purpose. I think copyright is a good and necessary compromise, where we temporarily give up some of our natural rights in order to improve society in the long run. But I think some people place it on far too high a pedestal. Violating copyright  even my copyright  does not <i>necessarily</i> make you a bad, selfish person any more than my insistence that I am entitled to this weird privilege called ""copyright"" makes me a bad, selfish person.",1330632066

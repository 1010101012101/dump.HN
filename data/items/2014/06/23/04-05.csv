People can vote with their feet. Guess which one people like better? (Hint: People have been moving out of dense cities for 100 years now.)<p>Are you planning on forcing people to accommodate themselves to your definition of the perfect city?<p>> We have disparate clusters/districts related to activities like &#x27;work&#x27;, &#x27;play&#x27;, &#x27;shop&#x27;, and &#x27;sleep&#x27;, rather than having these constructs evenly interspersed.<p>Is that supposed to be a bad thing? The world is not sim-city. Not everyone wants to live near a shopping area.<p>> We have supermarkets instead of markets.<p>Markets are not large enough to carry everything, so when I lived in a place like that I never went to the market, so I got the worst of both worlds: High density (i.e. traffic) plus a long drive.<p>I moved out.<p>You are acting as if the layout of cities was a commandment given from on high, but actually cities are laid out as they are <i>because people like it that way</i>.",1403499568

7930323,comment,7928924,7930249,1,0,StandardFuture,,,">I&#x27;d like to know why you consider it abhorrent<p>1. I am a Turing fan-boy. 2. I am also a big advocate of the fact that Software IS hardware. And in reality, all computation is software (&#x27;hardware&#x27; is merely the materials engineering that implements the computational &#x27;logic&#x27; e.g. Electrical Engineering for modern-day computers). Classifying a Turing Machine as a &#x27;hardware&#x27; abstraction is just so not true. It&#x27;s an Abstract Computational Machine -- it abstracts the concept of computation (not the fact that it uses a Tape, etc.) and as I said earlier: computation IS software.<p>>I&#x27;m not sure what the concern is with every object having a morphism<p>Every program is a function type, and every type is an object. Thus, (type-theoretically at least) every object within the category is also a morphism and vice-versa. Considering Turing Completeness, we can create any program and thus any type from other types (it itself being a type). Thus, the Category can be achieved as a whole as a &#x27;program-type (function type)&#x27; since everything within the category is a type itself. This creates strange paradoxes, where the category (and all sub-categories and functors between them) are inside the category itself. (Side-thought: I wonder though if you could address decision problems with this craziness.)<p>>typed linear lambda theories<p>Symmetric Monoidal Categories give rise to Linear Type Theories. However, Braided Monoidal Categories (and especially Monoidal Categories) allow for more. The Rosetta Stone diagram in the conclusion section doesn&#x27;t restrict the category class (if I remember correctly).<p>>I tend to find this paper really illuminating and instructive<p>Me too. :)<p>>but instead an exploration of lambda theories.<p>hehe, I&#x27;m not a fan of Lambda Theories (but please excuse my bias).<p>EDIT: An explanation for the downvote would be appreciated. Thanks. :)",1403499432

7930318,comment,7929718,7929718,8,0,bbarn,,,"As a long time bike commuter, I&#x27;ve never liked the &quot;protected&quot; bike lanes put in in Chicago.  The few streets they work WELL on were already great cycling routes before they had the lanes, and the other streets they haven&#x27;t worked well on they are often repurposed by whatever entity decides to repurpose them.<p>Several of them are somehow converted into school children drop off zones for cars during the morning (i.e., at the time that people should be commuting on them they&#x27;re made even more dangerous - Des Plaines Ave near the church school for example)  And of course despite multiple calls out to advocacy groups and local leadership, nothing seems to beat the &quot;for the children&quot; argument, despite the fact that what it&#x27;s really doing is &quot;for the traffic&quot; more than anything.<p>That&#x27;s one of many examples though, but the short of it is - things like protected bike lanes ignore the real problems in urban commuting, of which there are essentially four, in my opinion:<p>1 - Traffic is too fast - The basic speed limit unless posted otherwise, in the city of Chicago is 30mph.  this speed limit is nearly NEVER enforced by police (Hello free revenue stream?) and traffic down major streets regularly goes at 50+ mph.<p>2 - Traffic is too slow - congested streets cause just as many problems as speeding.  Being in a car when you&#x27;re stuck in stop light to stop light traffic is infuriating.  People are constantly looking for a move they can make to avoid it.  Even with a bike lane, cars will constantly try to pass on the right, use what&#x27;s supposed to be parking to make moves towards turning early, etc.  This has been the source of my own collisions with automobiles 4/5 times I&#x27;ve had them in 10 years.<p>3 - Lack of a safe place to stow the bike.  Any respectable bike will cost $500.00 and up.  Sure, you can get some used single speed or old ten speed for less, but walk into any shop, and you won&#x27;t see much below that.  Locking those outside, especially on a regular schedule, makes them not last very long. (not to mention weather, which while often fine to do a short ride in, all day exposed to can wreak havoc on even a great bike).<p>4 - The whole, stinky at work, work stigma, aging building infrastructure problem.  Sure, a few downtown offices have showers, but it&#x27;s certainly the exception (spoken as a developer who&#x27;s worked in many offices over the years) and in some companies being &quot;that guy&quot; seems to have it&#x27;s own negative connotations.<p>Want to spend that bike-focused infrastructure money well?  Start offering tax breaks to companies providing showers (I&#x27;d hear this was a thing once, but never found any proof of it), or safe places to store bicycles indoors.  Want to create more of that bike-focused infrastructure money?  Start enforcing speed limit laws that exist already, and start looking more towards traffic patterns for cars as a whole, and stick to shared lanes and painted lanes.",1403499383

7930310,comment,7927640,7927640,6,0,dcnstrct,,,"As someone who leads an analytics team in the advertising industry I have to say this title and the studies they are referencing are not accurate to the entire industry at all.<p>Advertising absolutely works when done right. The effect on brand consideration, shopping behavior, and incremental purchase  value can be quantified. The most sophisticated advertisers spend a lot of money to accurately track and ensure their campaigns are lifting their desires metrics.<p>Now to the eBay study they reference. That study is specific to eBay, a large brand that has spent hundreds of millions a year on advertising for many years and is a top web property visited by a significant percent of the online audience. For eBay it turns out brand search marketing largely does not have a contribution as most of their shoppers are likely going to buy anyway.<p>Trying to generalize that to a brand that did not have the amount of equity, natural SEO rankings, and established shopping behaviors would be foolhardy. Additionally if you dig deeper into the eBay study they did find a positive effect for the small percent of users that are new shoppers to eBay. They just happen to be a relatively small percent of the audience reached with the spend given the large size of eBay.<p>In the digital space there is a huge variability in performance based on the type of ad, the nature of the targeting, the product being advertised, the creative message, etc. Trying to generalize to all online advertising without controlling for the kind of brand, product being sold, current marketing positioning, and campaign objective seems a bit naive.<p>In our work we find huge variability in performance even within the same web property dependent on the placement of the ad within the site and the unit being served. We measure how long the ad was on the page, how many users actually hovered over it in view, and then the incremental lift of exposed users compared to control group. Turns out if you properly optimize to maximize true ad viewing and engagement you will see lifts in brand response, digital visitation, and shopping metrics compared to the control.<p>In fact I&#x27;d much rather have money for digital advertising any day over old fashioned ads with the limited tracking possible. I know how many people saw our spot on the YouTube home page, how long they spent interacting with it, and can tell you exactly what they were interested in. For that TV spot I don&#x27;t know if you were watching, skipping, going to the bathroom, looking at your phone, or any number of other factors which could diminish effectiveness.<p>TLDR; online advertising works when done correctly and absolutely can be measured",1403499189

7930303,comment,7929718,7930212,3,0,jrock08,,,"I used to blame other cyclists for this, but at some level I understand. After getting buzzed by yet another car while going downhill at 30 mph on a 25 mph road, and then getting pulled out in front of by a car off a side street, who assumed that I was moving slowly.  I then got to a stop light that didn&#x27;t change in my favor due to the sensors not being quite sensitive enough to pick up a bike which forced me to make a decision between running the (traffic-less) red light or fully unclipping, and shuffling my way 20 feet and up a 6 inch curb to the pedestrian button.<p>While technically I may be a &quot;vehicle&quot; in the eyes of the law, in reality, I&#x27;m between a pedestrian and a &quot;real vehicle&quot; without the benefits of either. Add to this strange intersections with traffic, where the cars have a stop sign (side road) and the bike path traffic have the right of way (in theory). Or worse, places where bike paths strangely end leaving a biker unfamiliar with the area unsure as to how to proceed. Adopting seemingly inconsistent and strange behavior is the only way to make cycling feasible in many places.  The adoption of standard ways for interaction with traffic and better signage would decrease the cognitive load required to cycle and produce more consistent cyclist/vehicle interactions.<p>Regardless of my dislike of certain car behavior, such as overtaking without giving space, and misjudging speed, I much prefer riding on speed limited (25mph-35mph) streets to bike paths simply because I know how to act like a car, and people generally expect me to act like a car.",1403499066

Erlang is not the best tool for fast math and data crunching. Now it could supervise and feed data to a specialized data cruncher.<p>There is Wings3D, a subdivision 3D modeler, but that is kind of an exception.<p>> Python is easy to get started with, [...] especially due to its ability to easily integrate with C.<p>Erlang can also integrate with C. Granted not in ctypes or ffi type way, but with Python C-extension like way. It is not that bad. There are good examples of c libraries integrated that way (LevelDB for example, JSON parsers, etc).<p>> None of these are strong areas for Erlang/Elixir, but they are for Python.<p>Python is a great language.

From messaging systems, to databases, to controlling hardware, to running websites, streaming video, real-time bidding systems, very large file storage back-ends, message brokers, chat systems, presence systems, game &quot;lobby&quot; services. Payment systems. The list goes on. In this sort of &quot;concurrent and reliable backend systems&quot; domain it solve quite a bit of general tasks if you wish.

In fact, whether or not I can spend most of my commute in that bike lane plays a huge factor in deciding if I&#x27;m going to bike to my destination. Unfortunately, even that bike line is flawed. For one, it relies on painted lines to separate the lane, which as the video in the article says, isn&#x27;t that great a solution, since it doesn&#x27;t physically keep the cars out. Taxis are the worst offenders and tend to treat the bike lane as their personal parking space.<p>Chicago also implemented dedicated traffic signals for bikes, as the article recommends, which sound amazing in theory. Unfortunately, most cars seem to completely ignore them and drive as they would on non-protected streets. For example, when the bike lane is green, the turn signal for cars is red. I rarely see cars actually obey that red light and regularly turn into oncoming bike traffic. Even worse is pedestrians who view the bike lane as an extension of the sidewalk, and will wait in the bike lane to cross the street.<p>These problems won&#x27;t be fixed until protected bike lanes are the norm, rather than the exception, and following bike lane laws are taught in driver&#x27;s ed and heavily enforced by police.<p>Unfortunately, nobody really cares about bikers.

There is virtually no &quot;demand&quot; for more professional athletes while the demand for good software developers is ever growing and is unlikely to show any sign of slowing down.  There are cycles but the trend is up.  It is also really hard to be a good software developer and requires a combination of aptitude and attitude.<p>I work for a US startup and I know we do not discriminate by age (if anything older developers are over-represented).  In companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, more experienced developers (in their 40s and 50s) are pretty well represented (keep in mind that as you go back in time the % developers is naturally less simply because the industry was much much smaller).  Saying that I realize that in some places simply being a bit older would be seen as a poor fit and definitely someone who is just starting to code in their 50s is not going to be looked at the same as someone out of MIT.<p>Another thing to realize is that software development is an immensely wide field.  I think your advice is reasonable for someone who has only started writing code in school, works in relatively &quot;easy&quot; areas where a lot of expertise isn&#x27;t required, is really in it for the money and approaches things with that sort of cold success driven attitude.  People who have talent, go deep into their fields of study and are highly motivated are probably looking at a much longer successful career. [EDIT: In other words it depends on what types of software you work on, your abilities and passion, and your further ability to maintain your abilities and passion and expand your knowledge.]<p>That said there&#x27;s absolutely no way to project what the world economy or job market will look like 20 years from today.  There are likely to be pretty big changes.  One can imagine a much larger % of the population working remotely.  One can imagine some breakthroughs related to aging that will make the entire age issue moot.  Who knows.  My advice to juniors is to strive to be the best at what you do.  If you&#x27;re the best you&#x27;ll always have a job.  Professional athletes don&#x27;t always stop working when they&#x27;re 30-something, they can become a higher paid coach. They can work on TV.

It&#x27;s true that programmers over-emphasize the importance of this most of the time, but you do need <i>something</i>.<p>2. You cannot charge $100/hour if you&#x27;re not able to act like a professional. This includes communicating professionally, dressing professionally, etc. Again, programmers over-estimate the importance of this, but there is a basic requirement (which is probably on par with most North American white collar work).<p>3. You will never be able to bill 100% of your work time and it&#x27;s probably not realistic to even get 60% in your first year of solo operation. (That, by the way, is part of why $100/hour is on the low end of what you should be charging.)<p>4. You will almost never get paid on time, and it&#x27;s not unusual (a few times a year) to face expenditures which represent more than a week&#x27;s work (tax season, etc), so you should have <i>at least</i> a month&#x27;s worth of cash float available.<p>5. Regardless of your overall market value and the value you&#x27;re able to create for any business, there are many parts of North America where businesses will not justify spending more than $100/hour on your work. Your options (as a freelancer/consultant) are basically moving or trying to work remotely (see 6).<p>6. You&#x27;re not going to get a &quot;freelance job&quot; at $100/hour working remotely unless you&#x27;re $INSERT_INTERNET_FAMOUS_NAME. You <i>might</i> get a <i>consulting engagement</i>, but only if you&#x27;ve met the client in person previously, or you&#x27;ve been referred by someone, or you have some very serious Fu. (I am probably overstating the difficulty here, but not by much.)<p>7. It&#x27;s near impossible to pull off #&#x27;s 1 through 6 if you don&#x27;t have food to eat this week. (I&#x27;m speaking from experience, although in reality I have a wider support net than most people. This list is doubly true for those without a support net.)<p>In other words, &#x27;patio11 and &#x27;tptacek and the other good people giving wonderful consulting advice are right 100% of the time, but they&#x27;re making reasonable assumptions about functional professional adults with a few connections and a bit of money in the bank (again, they&#x27;re optimizing their advice for people who have the resources but lack the confidence). If you&#x27;re not there yet, get a job for a while--it has its own set of challenges anyway.

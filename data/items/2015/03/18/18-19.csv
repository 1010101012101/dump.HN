Regardless of the speculation, the sites look to be interesting places to explore on future missions.<p>In hypothesizing possible causes, I wonder about the relative size of the ejecta of a type 2 super nova. Given that the Uranium, on the planet originated in such events at some point, and the 4.7 billion year half life, one could imagine perhaps a modestly dense fragment cloud of U235 which was traveling at relativistic  velocity away from a Type II supernova, and it collides with the atmosphere of a planet in a far away star system. If the pieces were small enough they might simply heat up and impact the ground, however if they were massive enough, the shockwave of hitting the atmosphere might be sufficent to compress them into a supercritical mass. At which point the meteor would undergo rapid, and energetic, disassembly.",1426705097

9227883,comment,9226018,9226559,0,0,tracker1,,,"Honestly, I&#x27;m not a big fan of Class-based design... I really feel that JS lends itself much better to a system of functions with composition.<p>You can create a number of stand-alone functions that take an object that is operated against as a parameter and return a value, or modified object.  You can now test these independent functions as modules without a lot of distractions that come from side effects and state.  With that in place you can bind those functions into a composed object (state), and use that in the rest of your application.  You have composition, encapsulation and testable code that is just plain difficult to reason about when you are using Class-based inheritance and trying to test against it.<p>I actually love JS... it has its&#x27; quirks, but I find the flexibility it offers to exceed what most other languages offer for most tasks.  Using small function libraries and modules, I find that I can orchestrate much larger operations far more easily than can be done with other systems (usually).  All of that said, I also love C#, and use it very differently.<p>People should stop trying to walk in water, and just swim.",1426705085

9227853,comment,9226268,9227616,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"War has rarely had a significant effect on populations, certainly nothing like the effect of disease. Although many men in the ancient world died by violence (as they do in pre-political societies and failed states today) killing with stone tools is pretty difficult and dangerous, so constant warfare that killed enough men to account for a 17:1 reproductive ratio for long enough to leave its mark today would have made agriculture almost impossible. So it isn&#x27;t all that likely.<p>Social constraints on reproduction are considerably more likely. All human societies are mildly polygynous, with high-status males having more mates and low-status males having fewer. This is why human males are somewhat bigger than human females: bigger men were more successful in mate competition, despite the obvious disadvantage of a larger size for a tool-using opportunistic hunter-gatherer-scavenger [<i>].<p>The remarkable thing about this finding is that the level of social control was high enough to sustain such an </i>effective* exclusion of most men from mating opportunities. In every modern human society cheating (&quot;extra-pair copulations&quot;) is a significant factor in reproductive statistics, and a 17:1 ratio suggests a system that was capable of actually excluding, not just nominally excluding, the vast majority of men from reproducing.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to see how that could happen in a modern human population, but then again: men and women today are descendents of the 5% of males who were successful in reproducing under those circumstances, so it&#x27;s not entirely implausible that we are considerably fiercer mate competitors than our pre-agrarian ancestors.<p>[*] Bigger, more muscular bodies require more fuel, so bigger men starve to death more frequently than smaller men during bad years, which all the data we have on pre-political peoples suggest were not infrequent.",1426704870

His listeners pay $9.99 per months, but don&#x27;t stream very much, and a big chunk of what they do stream is Stratton&#x27;s material.  He doesn&#x27;t want most of that $9.99 going to those other damn artists, who are just random junk whose material isn&#x27;t sought out by anyone, but streamed randomly in Yoga classes, elevators, supermarkets or wherever.<p>If there is some user who paid $9.99, 70% of which is $7 going to the artists, and half of what that user listened to was Stratton&#x27;s tracks, Stratton wants $3.50 for that month, for that user alone. Add to that other similar users, and extrapolate to twelve months and you have some non-negligible cash at the end of the year: better than a fraction of a cent.<p>Problem is, no matter how you slice the pie, it is a zero-sum game. There is so much revenue and so many artists.\nMost artists, likely including Stratton, will lose this zero-sum game no matter how the pie is carved.<p>There is little difference between 99% of the artists getting peanuts, and 100% of the artists getting peanuts.

(This ends up often causing some hilarious confusion when they come visit and realize you can&#x27;t do a road trip tour of the country in one weekend.)<p>Let&#x27;s do some comparison. For kicks, and because I work with some Danes, we&#x27;ll use Copenhagen. Denmark has about 5 million people. The <i>state</i> I live in, Washington, has more than 7 million.<p>From Copehagan, you can travel 28km and be in Malmö Sweden. Hope you know Swedish! Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll still be in the metro area of the city I live in, Seattle.<p>Go 151km out and you can reach Stralsund in Germany. I&#x27;ll be able to just reach the tip of Canada, since Seattle happens to be near the corner of the state. But if I go East, I&#x27;m still less than a quarter of the way out of Washington. And, of course, even taking Canada into account, I&#x27;m still surrounded by only English speakers.<p>Up to 251km, and now we&#x27;ve reached Kolobrzeg in Poland. Still mostly in Washington, though I can just reach the edge of Oregon. Everyone there speaks English.<p>At 392km, we can get to Kristiansand, Norway. Meanwhile, I can <i>still be in Washington</i>.<p>A 530km jaunt across the Baltic gets us into Lithuania or Latvia. That just gets me to Oregon, Idaho, and a <i>bit</i> of Montana because Idaho is so narrow.<p>Going the other way, a 784km paddle across the North Sea gets us to the UK. That gets me a little bit of the way into Nevada and California. 44 states are still out of reach.<p>804km will make it to France. That gets me to... still just Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and California.<p>To get to a place where English isn&#x27;t the main language, I have to go about 1,700km to Mexico. That distance will take a Dane well past Moscow.<p>To get to Florida, the last place I lived, I have to go about 4,000km. That distance will take our Danish friend to Sudan, Saudia Arabia, Novosibirsk, or well past the North pole. In fact, it will take them just about over the Atlantic all the way to Canada.<p>So, yes, I do wish I was multi-lingual. But I don&#x27;t think it should come as a shock or be considered a failure that most Americans are when <i>it lets us converse with all of the more than 300 million people that are in a several thousand kilometer radius around us.</i>",1426704295

He sounded sane, smart, and his understanding of physics seemed sound.<p>I can&#x27;t stand this secular inquisition bullshit of cherry picking any sign of possible &#x27;out there&#x27;-ness and using it to completely trash peoples&#x27; entire bodies of thought and work. It&#x27;s anti-scientific. Please point out a problem with Brandenburg&#x27;s actual published work, or go away. Even if he does hold non-traditional or strange religious beliefs, it&#x27;s not relevant. Roman Catholicism is no more rational than Eastern mystic cults, so do we throw out all scientific papers by Roman Catholics?<p>I&#x27;m not much of a fan of PZ Myers either. I read him a bit back during the mid-2000s &#x27;intelligent design&#x27; creationist PR offensive, but stopped reading him as he got more and more shrill and irritating. IMHO Myers is as much a shrill fundamentalist as the religious bozos he constantly wars with.<p>One interesting thing Brandenburg did say was that when he came to believe himself that Mars had been nuked, possibly in act of &quot;biosphere genocide,&quot; the realization that this might have actually happened plunged him into a bit of a metaphysical crisis. He immediately thought of the Fermi Paradox, and that maybe the reason we&#x27;re not hearing/seeing anything is because there are big nasty genocidal intelligences out there that &#x27;cull&#x27; anything interesting from the universe. He said he actually got very depressed, and got deeper into religious/mystical stuff as part of this.<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound crazy to me, just human. Around here we&#x27;ve seen some IMHO irrational fears of super-human dangerous AIs circulating recently, and it seems to have led to a similar amount of metaphysical anxiety among some very brilliant and notable people in the CS field.<p>I&#x27;m very skeptical of Brandenburg&#x27;s thesis here, but I have to admit that the evidence he puts forward is very interesting. It either points to what he says -- some kind of incredibly ancient use of a nuclear device -- or an as yet undiscovered natural phenomenon that can yield a similar signature.<p>One possibility (other than &#x27;reaper&#x27; aliens) I can think of would be a natural nuclear reactor that actually went fully supercritical and detonated. Another would be a hypervelocity object, possibly traveling at some significant fraction of the speed of light, that impacted Mars and went thermonuclear in the atmosphere on kinetic energy alone. Maybe an asteroid or comet that got flung by a high-gravity body (black hole? neutron star?) or supernova debris could do that?",1426704243

However, it isn&#x27;t the elites, it&#x27;s the hordes of crooked and incompetent politicians who are destroying this nation from the inside out.  And the hordes of ignorant voters who let them get away with it. Their only motivation is to stay in office and enjoy the ride on the taxpayer&#x27;s back.  They don&#x27;t care about you, me or our children.  That&#x27;s the problem.<p>&quot;accumulating wealth at an ever increasing rate and not raising the wages of their employees&quot;<p>One thing has nothing whatsoever to do with the other.  Executive compensation and employee wages are controlled by different variables and different market forces.  Nobody is going to pay a welder $100 per hour because it would be a violation of fiduciary responsibility to do so when the market does not support such a wage due to either local forces or the fact that in a global economy you can get a welder in China (or wherever) for $5 per hour.  The executives running that company are paid based on the performance of the enterprise, investor or stockholder returns, etc.  Different metrics.<p>It&#x27;s like proposing that you should pay your gardener twice as much as prevailing market rates because you got a new job and your salary doubled.  And, BTW, not to be an evil elite, you ought to also call your cable company and ask them to charge you twice as much.  And your electricity rate should be twice as much.  In fact, you should pay twice as much for everything or you are evil.  Why?  Because it isn&#x27;t fair that you are accumulating more wealth now and the employees who service you directly or indirection won&#x27;t see their salaries improved.<p>Of course this is a flawed and ridiculous exampled but it does illustrate the point about the ends of the scale not being drive by the same variables.  Making such a connection is nothing short of nonsense.<p>Any entrepreneur knows this.  If you are running a business, large or small, one of your goals is to not pay more than the lowest possible market rate for anything you need.  Why?  Because your customers will get on Amazon and look to pay the lowest possible price for the widget you and a hundred other manufacturers make.  And so, it&#x27;s a closed feedback loop where you, the entrepreneur or executive, are controlled by a range of market variables in your decision making.  You simply can&#x27;t pay your welders twice as much because sales improved.  That is not how the real world works.<p>Many years ago Apple was nearly out of business.  Today they are one of the richest (if not the richest) companies in the world.  Was Steve Jobs evil elite for not doubling or tripling his programmer&#x27;s wages as the company skyrocketed and he got filthy rich?  No.  Of course not.  Nobody would propose that when it comes to Steve Jobs but most of the same people would crucify executives running companies like GE, Ford, GM and others under much lesser growth scenarios.  This is due to three things:  1- Ignorance of the business process; 2- Academic indoctrination; 3- Attacking the &quot;elites&quot; as a tool for political alignment and gains.<p>I could go on but I&#x27;ll stop here.  All I ask is that you try to reason through some of what you are saying.  Show me ONE, just  ONE country run by poor people.  And, if you find one, show me the degree of economic, educational, industrial, scientific, health and standard-of-living success they&#x27;ve had.  Now compare it to any other society where, yes, if you have financial resources you can move in circles often denied to the masses.  Not under some &quot;grant&quot;, &quot;deal&quot; or &quot;plan&quot; but simply because that&#x27;s the way it works.  Obama does not invite you or me to the White House.  He invites actors, singers, entertainers, industry leaders and political heavy-weights.  Why?  Because he is par of the &quot;elite&quot; now and that&#x27;s the way it works.  Yes, there&#x27;s a side of society most of us will never see or experience.  It&#x27;s the people buying $250K cars when we might struggle buying a $250K house.  Get over it.  That does not make them evil and it does not create a secret society of evil-doers under some equally secret pact to act with the goal to oppress the little guy.  That, my friend, is delusional.<p>Going back to the grind brother...",1426704071

This value can be financial (simply put, if a company is less generous with equity it means they think it&#x27;s worth _something_), but more importantly it can be in terms of missed learning and growth opportunities. I hate to jump on the &quot;too many SELECT ajax FROM php startups&quot; bandwagon -- I happen to work for one that is _very far from that, and yes we&#x27;re hiring! -- but there are plenty of startups that don&#x27;t offer much technical depth, or (for non-technical-folks) don&#x27;t do anything terribly interesting business-wise, either.<p>3) The two anti-patterns I&#x27;ve seen in Silicon Valley are folks _never_ working in smaller teams AND folks trying to get in &quot;as early as possible&quot; for the sake of... &quot;getting in as early as possible&quot; (treating all startups interchangeably, etc...). Good people and interesting work can be found in companies of _any_ size: don&#x27;t pass up these opportunities just because the company seems to be too bi _or_ too small. In the end, the compensation (not just financial/equity, but also choice of projects/responsibilities) company N+1 will offer will depend on what you can bring to the table, which in turn depends on what you&#x27;ve learned at companies {0,..., N}",1426703795

Right now we still know very little, full stop.<p>And I&#x27;d observe that the stories about these civilizations, viewed through modern technological eyes have some really weird aspects to them, such as, why would a civilization with technology capable of destroying planets (and, in this case, really, really <i>destroying</i> them, Death Star-style, not merely sterilizing the planet which is literally ten+ orders of magnitude easier [1]) only settle on Earth <i>after</i> the disaster? We&#x27;re not planning on waiting for Earth to go bad before heading to Mars... we&#x27;re pretty much only blocked on the requisite tech and on cosmological scales the instant we have it we&#x27;ll be there. There&#x27;s little reason to believe that a technological civilization of that scale would actually be destroyed even by its home planet going up in smoke. I&#x27;d submit the most likely hypothesis is that they were indeed written by humans thousands of years ago, who ultimately had no idea what technology was going to look like. (Heck, even we futurists are still only grasping at smoke in terms of what we&#x27;ll have 50-100 years from <i>today</i>, to say nothing of trying to guess thousands of years ago....)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://qntm.org/destroy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qntm.org/destroy</a>",1426703292

Since node.js/io.js with the likes of browserify you get a pretty nice module system as close to in the box as you can get.  With es6/7 and things like BabelJS you get a lot of modern features as well which makes functional composition really easy.<p>I understand the visceral hatred of JS... I simply don&#x27;t agree with it.  There are a few odd corner cases that are fairly easy to understand and avoid... The problem is that some developers want JS to behave like language X.  They have TypeScript which is becoming similar to ES4/C#, there&#x27;s coffeescript which brings in hints of ruby and python...  There&#x27;s closure and a host of other options too.<p>In the end, it comes down to taste... I try to stay closer to JS/ES proper, and simply avoid Prototypes for the most part in code I write.  I find that function libraries that operate against plain object instances are easier to reason about... treating data as idempotent (even without actually cloning objects) helps too.<p>JavaScript really has some beautify functionality to it, and I&#x27;ve felt this way for a very long time (back in the 90&#x27;s even).  I think it&#x27;s when people try to bend JS, or the browser DOM to their will that they get burned... as opposed to actually learning how to use JS.<p>It&#x27;s not the best for every use case... but it&#x27;s a pretty good option for many of them.",1426703244

Additionally,  aneuploidy (XXY, YYX, etc) may also account for some differences along with chimeric (2+ genomes per person due to fraternal twin merging in womb) anomalies. You also have to control for outliers such as Ghengis Khan and those types of mass rape and pillaging, as he has skewed the statistics a fair bit.<p>Still, if they controlled for all this, it is an AMAZING finding.

Labels/publishers can be comfortably in profit on a project, but the system is set up to make sure that artists don&#x27;t get a share of that profit.<p>Now - labels played all kinds of games to make sure they paid artists as little as possible, up to and including outright lies about the sales and income. (Some writers have discovered that publishers sometimes still try this.)<p>Even so, most traditional label deals were far more generous to artists than today&#x27;s streaming deals. Labels also spent significant money on PR, publicity, and payola, which Spotify and YouTube obviously don&#x27;t.<p>Even fairly minor bands could live comfortably for a few years from radio play and royalties from a single mid-list album. Top sellers could afford castles, private jets, and custom-built recording studios.<p>This was partly a feature of scarcity, when there were far fewer artists selling music to a public that was more interested in music.<p>But it was also a direct result of more generous accounting/royalty options, and the fact that once artists crossed a certain threshold they had enough spare capital to start developing alternative stand-alone businesses.",1426702874

9227494,comment,9226268,9227332,0,0,ardit33,,,"This is a great passage from the Red Queen, that might explain what was happening at the time:<p>In the ancient empire of the Incas, sex was a heavily regulated industry. The sun-king Atahualpa kept fifteen hundred women in each of many “houses of virgins” throughout his kingdom. They were selected for their beauty and were rarely chosen after the age of eight—to ensure their virginity. But they did not all remain virgins for long: They were the emperor’s concubines. Beneath him, each rank of society afforded a harem of a particular legal size. Great lords had harems of more than seven hundred women. “Principal persons” were allowed fifty women; leaders of vassal nations, thirty; heads of provinces of 100,000 people, twenty; leaders of 1,000 people, fifteen; administrators of 500 people, twelve; governors of 100 people, eight; petty chiefs over 50 men, seven; chiefs of 10 men, five; chiefs of 5 men, three. That left precious few for the average male Indian whose enforced near-celibacy must have driven him to desperate acts, a fact attested to by the severity of the penalties that followed any cuckolding of his seniors. If a man violated one of Atahualpa’s women, he, his wife, his children, his relatives, his servants, his fellow villagers, and all his lamas would be put to death, the village would be destroyed, and the site strewn with stones. As a result, Atahualpa and his nobles had, shall we say, a majority holding in the paternity of the next generation. They systematically dispossessed less privileged men of their genetic share of posterity. Many of the Inca people were the children of powerful men. In the kingdom of Dahomey in West Africa, all women were at the pleasure of the king. Thousands of them were kept in the royal harem for his use, and the remainder he suffered to “marry” the more favored of his subjects. The result was that Dahomean kings were very fecund, while ordinary Dahomean men were often celibate and barren. In the city of Abomey, according to one nineteenth-century visitor, “it would be difficult to find Dahomeans who were not descended from royalty.” The connection between sex and power is a long one.",1426702329

Capitalism is designed to maximize shareholder value.  A higher standard of living for workers was a side effect.  Was.<p>No other country has a working solution.  Japan had their real estate collapse 18 years before the US, and never fully came back.  Japan is an innovative country, yet they couldn&#x27;t crack this problem. They tried heavy infrastructure spending to pump up the economy, and it helped a little.<p>The golden age for American workers coincides with the Communist period in Russia. That&#x27;s not coincidental.  From the 1920s to the 1970s, capitalism had competition. There was real fear among capitalists that if capitalism didn&#x27;t deliver the goods to workers, the workers would vote to socialize industries.  Britain did that, with the government running the coal, steel, railroad, airline, electric power, and telecommunications industries.  It wasn&#x27;t an unreasonable fear.<p>So the US had the New Deal under Roosevelt, and strong unions.  After WWII, unions worked to keep wages high. There were explicit arrangements in the auto industry requiring wages to track productivity, so workers kept up. The auto and steel industries set the pattern for the rest of the economy.  In the 1950s and 1960s, the USSR started to look like a serious economic competitor.  The USSR built an atomic bomb, H-bombs, nuclear submarines, and a space program. Communism as a system looked like a threat.<p>That ended in the early 1980s, as the USSR stopped believing in its own &quot;workers paradise&quot;.  With fear of competition gone, capitalism could take a much harder line on its workers.  It took a while, but now employers can do pretty much anything they want to without fear of retribution.",1426702284

I quit an engineering job at a bigco to become engineer #2 (employee #3) at a startup where I was given about 1.5%. I joined just after their initial fundraise.<p>2. I took a huge pay cut - from $120k in total comp at bigco to $60k at startup.<p>3. The startup was acquired roughly 2.5 years later by a larger startup, my pay went up to $140k and my options converted to roughly 0.1% of the larger startup.<p>4. I stayed for a year at the larger startup, vested half my options and purchased them, which cost me about $60k to exercise. This is a lot of money to come up with when you&#x27;ve been underpaid for a couple of years.<p>5. The larger startup was acquired by a large public company - my shares were worth just shy of $500k once the dust settled.<p>Overall, the money I lost in salary is a little bit less than what I gained in equity over that 3.5 year period, once you factor in taxes, exercise costs, the time value of deferred compensation, and the raises I presumably would have gotten if I had stayed at bigco.<p>I&#x27;d do it again in a heartbeat because the experience was amazing (and led me to start my own company), however, I would have a hard time advising anyone to take a big pay cut in exchange for employee equity for solely financial reasons.",1426701856

Another way is to define utility in terms of an agent&#x27;s perceptions, but that is exploitable by wireheading, and IMO that flaw is unfixable as the agent gets more powerful.

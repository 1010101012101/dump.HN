Doyle"".<p>Conan Doyle taken aback by this responded: ""How do you know who I am, do you recognize me from my picture?""<p>the cabbie: ""No, sir, I've never seen a picture of you before, but I read you were going to be vacationing in France, your coat has the cut of an English gentleman, you have an ink spot on your finger indicating you are a writer and the train I picked you up on hails from the coast.

Your boss may have expected you to stay for many years, but they also know not everyone does. I've done it in the past. My boss was dissapointed, and I felt bad for about 10 minutes. I would have felt bad for years if I'd stayed.<p>If you're concerned about friendships at work, fair enough. If you stop working daily with people many friendships will become less active. However, you can still stay in touch with people. And in 5 or 10 years, when most people have moved on from both companies, you'll hopefully keep a few friends from both.<p>As for the impact on your career: don't worry about it. Nothing wrong with changing to a better job. If anything, I'd say it will improve your resume (as in: worked for google then for facebook, awesome.)",1273154237

Your objections would apply to any proof by contradiction.<p>Example: consider that Q exists even if we don't define it. We <i>discovered</i> it, not <i>invented</i> it.

Taking apart a PDF is nothing - putting it back together in Flash with the right appearance, cropping, individual character metainfo, hyperlinks, caching, progressive loading, etc., etc., is science. To do that you need to be very long on Flash, and they just threw away all that inventory and expertise.<p>Which is, of course, a killer move if they can actually pull it off as they will be the first and only company to do it (again, comparing with Google's Javascript PDF viewer misses the point, as that 'just' renders images).

I'm just stating that the article makes a few invalid assumptions.<p>Sales are lost to piracy, and it is always beneficial to find ways of turning pirates in to buyers, be it DRM or some kind of added value.  I'd prefer it be the latter, but that's a much longer, harder, and more expensive route, as it requires added development.<p>Really, the only thing this affects (in terms of the entrenched game industry) is the PC.  Piracy on consoles is low enough as to be nearly insignificant, due to the hoops required to pirate on console, coupled with the potential downsides.<p>I wish for a magic non-intrusive drm for PC so we could use it as a primary platform again.  Sure, shoddy ports aren't helping, but at the end of the day, even non-ports have serious issues if they don't ship with a major online component.<p>I am completely anti-drm on most medias, but with games, there's a catch:  They have no other means of income.  When a TV show is pirated, well, they still get money from TV ads and dvd sales.  When a movie is pirated, they still have the box office sales.  When a cd is pirated, the artist still makes money at concerts.<p>When a game gets pirated, well, too bad so sad I guess.  It's a difficult situation for everyone.",1273153264

""There was no way we were ever going to take money from Sequoia, given what they'd done to me,"" says Parker.

They didn't even make a pitch for Wirehog. Zuckerberg showed a PowerPoint presentation David Letterman-style: ""The Top Ten Reasons You Should Not Invest in Wirehog."" It started out almost seriously. ""The number 10 reason not to invest in Wirehog: we have no revenue."" Number 9: ""We will probably get sued by the music industry."" By the final few points it was unashamedly rude. Number 3: ""We showed up at your office late in our pajamas."" Number 2: ""Because Sean Parker is involved."" And the number one reason Sequoia should not invest in Wirehog: ""We're only here because [a Sequoia partner] told us to come.""

When I first lived there, the ruling party (which is once more the ruling party, after a change of ruling party in between) used political assassination and other terrorist acts to keep its grip on power. During the late 1980s, the common people stopped being afraid there, realizing they outnumbered the secret police, and peaceful mass demonstrations and continual efforts at forming opposition political movements and a free press when both were formally banned eventually resulted in free elections and a change of government. Here in the United States, and all over the world, that should be our response to terrorist threats: keep on seeking more freedom and more exposure of truth.

519931,story,,,1,2,wumi,"The Financial Crisis in simpler terms...drinkbonds, alkbonds, and pukebonds",,"via e-mail:<p>The financial crisis explained in simple terms.......<p>Heidi is the proprietor of a bar in Berlin. In order to increase sales, she decides to allow her loyal customers - most of whom are unemployed alcoholics - to drink now but pay later. She keeps track of the drinks consumed on a ledger (thereby granting the customers loans). Word gets around and as a result increasing numbers of customers flood into Heidi's bar.  Taking advantage of her customers' freedom from immediate payment constraints, Heidi increases her prices for wine and beer, the most-consumed beverages. Her sales volume increases massively.<p>A young and dynamic customer service consultant at the local bank recognizes these customer debts as valuable future assets and increases Heidi's borrowing limit.
He sees no reason for undue concern since he has the debts of the alcoholics as collateral.  At the bank's corporate headquarters, expert bankers transform these customer assets into DRINKBONDS, ALKBONDS and PUKEBONDS. These securities are then traded on markets worldwide. No one really understands what these abbreviations mean and how the securities are guaranteed. Nevertheless, as their prices continuously climb, the securities become top-selling items.<p>One day, although the prices are still climbing, a risk manager (subsequently of course fired due his negativity) of the bank decides that slowly the time has come to demand payment of the debts incurred by the drinkers at Heidi's bar.  However they cannot pay back the debts. Heidi cannot fulfill her loan obligations and claims bankruptcy.  DRINKBOND and ALKBOND drop in price by 95 %. PUKEBOND performs better, stabilizing in price after dropping by 80 %.<p>The suppliers of Heidi's bar, having granted her generous payment due dates and having invested in the securities are faced with a new situation. Her wine supplier claims bankruptcy, her beer supplier is taken over by a competitor.  The bank is saved by the Government following dramatic round-the-clock consultations by leaders from the governing political parties.  The funds required for this purpose are obtained by a tax levied on the non-drinkers.<p>Finally an explanation I understand...",1237301959

The result is a bit bulkier than using a twist-tie to bind the bundle, and I'm not sure how good it is for the cable for long-term storage (since it effectively adds a slight twist at several points along the cable's length).

Assembling a bunch of off-the-shelf components into a new idea (ref: Chumby) is going to be much cheaper than developing your own custom asic's (ref: SiCortex).<p>My experience over the course of a couple of hardware startups doing more off-the-shelf approach is it would take you about $20-$35MM in total funding for a typical hardware startup doing something semi new/radical.<p>The hardware design itself can actually be relatively cheap.  Packaging (custom tooling for cases, etc.) can easily cost you $20K-$300K (ie: as much as a big Angel round for some software startups).  Manufacturing costs are usually a function of volume commitments and timing.  So, you are going to be incented to commit to larger manufacturing runs than you are comfortable with to keep the per-unit cost low.  Inevitably, after you do this you find there is some trivial but important item you missed, so you end up with re-work costs, or if you're very unlucky a lot of scrapped inventory.<p>To answer your Tablet PC question, my guess is that you're looking at $10M.  There is not a lot of invention there.  You'd pull together a lot of off-the-shelf components into a new form factor.  Most of your early costs would be sucked up by the design and tooling of the casing and overall industrial design.  I'd venture that you'd be $500K into it just for ID and an ME to layout the (presumably) injection molding designs for the case and first mold.  Budget another $150K ish for UL and FCC certs (your outsourced factory can help you with a lot of this process).  Then you're likely to go through probably $250K in the initial hardware designs and single-unit prototypes.  You'll generally need or want 1 prototype for each developer (probably 5-8 in this case), plus another 6-12 for QA, and another dozen or so for demos and for employees to carry around and just ""use"" out in the wild.  If you're making a tablet with an $800 price point, your production BOM is going to be around $200, and total manufacturing costs around $350ish, but your first prototypes will cost you $1000ish/ea at first because a lot of it will be work done by hand, etc.<p>So, thinking purely off the top of my head, you'd probably take a $1M angel round, a $4M A round and a $5M B round.  Since this is a semi-proven CE device and not something radically new, you just need to build it and get it out there, not convince the world why they need it.",1237299467

For example, early arcade hardware was more prone to using analog components - think of the rumbling explosions of games like Space Invaders, or the 6-voice subtractive synth used in Sente games[0], reused by Sequential Circuits as a standalone synth[1]. The Atari 8-bit chips(both TIA and POKEY) contained &quot;distortion&quot; effects (based on a variable-length LFSR) that could be used for both noise and guitar-like tonal timbres[2]. The true successor to the SID is the Ensoniq DOC used in the Apple IIGS[3] and SQ-80[4], but it gets little attention. And lastly a number of later chips, including the Game Boy, had a low-res wavetable on at least one voice, which allowed for some more timbre options(albeit 90% of the time it was a sawtooth)[5].<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xCiOXQJO18"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xCiOXQJO18</a> (MAME emulates this chip but does a terrible job)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa-Cwn4po40"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa-Cwn4po40</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDeV7wrB2c0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDeV7wrB2c0</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WujTzBCRBAY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WujTzBCRBAY</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y8fNnDJUx0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y8fNnDJUx0</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caz21XapSiA&list=PL3B271CECB53A0AD2&index=11"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caz21XapSiA&list=PL3B271CECB...</a>",1444971270

10397535,comment,10397029,10397426,0,0,mtth,,,"I&#x27;ll start with the second question since it&#x27;s easier to answer: some of the other libraries don&#x27;t support all Avro features (for example I don&#x27;t think `node-avro-io` supports encoding records defined inside arrays), so they&#x27;re unable to run some of the benchmarks. Both the reference Java implementation and `avsc` are able to parse all these schemas so don&#x27;t have any -1s in their columns.<p>Performance-wise, the main benefits came from doing as much preprocessing as possible. Here are a couple examples of what is done when a schema is parsed:<p>+ All methods for encoding and decoding nested types get fully resolved, removing the need for lookups (for example an array of integers would have a reference to the method for encoding integers).<p>+ A constructor, and encoding/decoding methods gets programmatically generated for each record type. This avoids having to iterate over the fields each time. Same for unions. (Having a &quot;Class&quot; for each record type also lets us attach useful methods to its prototype, available for all record instances.)<p>Then there are a few other general ideas like making sure v8 is able to optimize all the methods on the critical path, or reusing buffers as much as possible to avoid allocating too many objects.",1444971209

10397533,comment,10397200,10397301,0,0,curun1r,,,"The problem with most online reviews is that they usually only collect reviews from those who are motivated to submit a review. This usually skews reviews towards the 1 or 5 star ends of the spectrum because 3-star reviewers aren&#x27;t really motivated to go through the hassle of submitting a review, unless they&#x27;re the type of person who obsessively reviews everything (think Yelp! Elite).<p>The only real way to get past this is to know when someone is a candidate to review something and solicit reviews from them. Amazon reviews fall into this category and it&#x27;s the reason why they&#x27;re pretty reliable. I&#x27;d bet they&#x27;re getting 5-10% conversion (I&#x27;ve worked on systems that got over 30%, but different types of reviewable products have different conversion rates) on every &quot;Did product X meet your expectations?&quot; email they send. They&#x27;ve got their die hards that review everything and who&#x27;s reviews everyone finds helpful, but the star rating will be largely determined by the larger group of people that write 1-2 sentences and submit.<p>But without closing the loop and attempting to get reviews from every possible reviewer, ratings are far less useful.",1444971160

So if you require 10 refuelling launches, your total risk is 1-20%.<p>Say you had a large moon lander, or multiple landers that make up a robotic fuel collection and refining system. Then you have a reusable lander-launcher that lands, collects the fuel and delivers whatever it doesn&#x27;t use for takeoff/landing into a orbital fuel deport orbiting either the moon or earth.\nActually might be best to have your deport orbiting the moon until it&#x27;s full then send it on a slow, low-fuel, multi-month path back to earth orbit, perhaps you meet the Mars transfer vehicle there.<p>If at any point the fuel transfer lander-launcher fails, you can launch a new one from earth and push back your Mars mission. Perhaps you have multiple fuel transfer landers as a contingency, or to increase throughput (fuel in orbit isn&#x27;t just useful for a single Mars mission)<p>Only once you have your fuel ready, do you launch your Mars crew.<p>You could do a similar setup at Mars to collect fuel for your trip and avoid having to drag that fuel from the moon. But a Mars fuel transfer lander-launch would be much more complex and risky, and it would be a lot harder to land the fuel collection/refining facility.",1444970864

10397480,comment,10394585,10397008,0,0,emin-gun-sirer,,,"Miner consolidation is a long-standing problem with Bitcoin itself.<p>When Ittay and I discovered selfish mining [1], we were quite worried about the size of mining pools at the time. Even though we also came up for a fix against selfish mining, the fix only prohibits selfish mining for pools <25%, and we also found that there can never be a fix to prohibit selfish mining for pools >=33%.<p>Things looked grim for a while, and we played a role in pushing back against GHash when they exceeded 51% around April of &#x27;14. The only tool that the community had at the time to break up large miners was just social pressure.<p>In part as a reaction to GHash crossing of the 51% line, we [2] and Andrew Miller et al [3] came up with techniques based on non-outsourceable puzzles. This is a cool technique  that would make it difficult for miners to run large open pools. It does require a potentially disruptive change to Bitcoin, so it&#x27;s good to have in one&#x27;s back pocket if the mining situation gets out of hand, but it&#x27;s not something you want to deploy.<p>Luckily, Ittay&#x27;s subsequent work on the Miner&#x27;s Dilemma [4] discovered an incredibly interesting result: it pays for miners to attack other miners who are running large open pools. This puts natural pressure on miners to not open themselves up to the public and accept people into their pools willy nilly. This in turn is, I think, fantastic news, as it means that the problem may take care of itself, at least when it comes to open pools.<p>Overall, the distribution of mining power is a point of concern for everyone in the Bitcoin space. The situation looked bleak at first, as it looked like there were few mechanisms to keep open pools from growing ever larger. But now we have a strong technical solution and a natural process that is well-characterized. Large solo miners still remain an ongoing concern.<p>Hope this is useful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/06/18/how-to-disincentivize-large-bitcoin-mining-pools/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/06/18/how-to-disincentivi...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://cs.umd.edu/~amiller/nonoutsourceable_full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cs.umd.edu/~amiller/nonoutsourceable_full.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/12/03/the-miners-dilemma/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/12/03/the-miners-dilemma/</a>",1444969962

Ordinarily, the tests would be independently evaluated in the peer-reviewed literature, and through the literature is how scientists and physicians would assess the value of what Theranos is offering; without peer-reviewed literature, there is little to go on.  Maybe it works, maybe it doesn&#x27;t, only peer-reviewed literature counts so we don&#x27;t know.<p>Theranos has an unusual board of directors for a diagnostic testing company, with surprisingly little medical experience overall.  Holmes herself is a college dropout—it&#x27;s very hard to compete in a highly specialized and technical field without the proper knowledge base and experience, and traditionally that would be with an M.D.+fellowship or Ph.D.+postdoc.  In interviews, when things get the least bit technical, Holmes sounds like she doesn&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s talking about.  Theranos&#x27; patents, of which Holmes is a named inventor, are (IMHO) vaguely written.  Could Holmes be a diagnostics savant?  It&#x27;s possible, but I don&#x27;t see credible evidence to suggest this is the case.<p>The popular media has hyped up the company technology a lot, but in reality microfluidics is not new to the diagnostics arena, and it remains unclear as to what exactly Theranos offers as an advancement on what others are doing.  There are also many technical issues to be considered with fingersticks vs. venipuncture samples, and Theranos has never explained how they have overcome those issues other than unsubstantiated assurances that their tests match standard lab tests.<p>There is also a fundamental problem with the entire hypothesis underlying Theranos: which I very crudely summarize as more tests = better health.  That hypothesis is sophomoric and does not hold under the current thinking of evidence-based medicine.  One can over test, and it has real, proven consequences towards the health of the patient in terms of invasiveness, costs, and potential risks due to unneeded procedures.<p>Does Theranos have something unique?  It&#x27;s not impossible.  My null hypothesis is that they do not, and until I see something in the peer-reviewed literature suggesting otherwise, I am thinking it&#x27;s smoke and mirrors.<p>Edit: All that text and I didn&#x27;t directly answer your question!

It references about 7% of the population, people working at least half of the year who are below the poverty line. The 2013 poverty line was $11,490 for individuals, $23,550 for a family of four. I&#x27;d consider twice that to still be poor by any reasonable definition. In my area (around Atlantic City, New Jersey) you&#x27;d be lucky to find a two bedroom apartment for $1000/mo. So if a family of four crams into a two bedroom apartment, or an individual splits one with a roommate, that&#x27;s half the &#x27;poverty level&#x27; in rent. Without covering utilities, transportation, food, etc.<p>As to your second point, I&#x27;m sorry, but I simply don&#x27;t have the time to do the proper research on that one. You may be correct. I was primarily basing on anecdotal evidence from what I&#x27;ve seen and experienced in my local area. The statistics may also not be as clear as one would think. As I said, in my area, someone at twice the poverty level would still struggle to get by, and in many cities, I expect it is significantly more. At the same time, in many rural or semi-rural areas, housing costs become a much smaller factor, which leaves more room for things like a vehicle. Looking at the poor based on the amount of income, without looking at circumstances at an almost individual level is a difficult prospect.<p>I will also say that it is easy to overlook things that go from a non-issue to a time and effort consuming problem when lack of resources is involved. Lack of transportation or a washer were just two examples that came to mind. Also note that if 74% of poor households have a vehicle, that means 26% do not.

Being vague implies that the intended meaning cannot be discerned, while being ambiguous implies that the law can be interpreted and applied to multiple scenarios, even those that did not exist at the time of its writing.<p>IANAL nor have I read the ECPA itself, but from my understanding of the case, the judge fully understood the intention of the law and applied it appropriately to this case. Had the law been less ambiguous and more specifically defined ""radio technologies,"" then we may have ended up with a situation where wiretapping encrypted wifi might actually be considered legal.

2722664,comment,2722299,2722299,2,0,mrb,,,"The author, Ben Laurie, argues that the way <i>checkpoints</i> are arbitrarily applied to the Bitcoin block chain relies on trust (of the developers), and therefore make Bitcoin centralized. He then argues that an efficient currency could be designed based on this trust.<p>Firstly, only 7 blocks are checkpointed out of the 134000 in existence (as of July 2, 2011):<p><pre><code>        if ((nHeight ==  11111 && hash != uint256(""0x0000000069e244f73d78e8fd29ba2fd2ed618bd6fa2ee92559f542fdb26e7c1d"")) ||\n            (nHeight ==  33333 && hash != uint256(""0x000000002dd5588a74784eaa7ab0507a18ad16a236e7b1ce69f00d7ddfb5d0a6"")) ||\n            (nHeight ==  68555 && hash != uint256(""0x00000000001e1b4903550a0b96e9a9405c8a95f387162e4944e8d9fbe501cd6a"")) ||\n            (nHeight ==  70567 && hash != uint256(""0x00000000006a49b14bcf27462068f1264c961f11fa2e0eddd2be0791e1d4124a"")) ||\n            (nHeight ==  74000 && hash != uint256(""0x0000000000573993a3c9e41ce34471c079dcf5f52a0e824a81e7f953b8661a20"")) ||\n            (nHeight == 105000 && hash != uint256(""0x00000000000291ce28027faea320c8d2b054b2e0fe44a773f3eefb151d6bdc97"")) ||\n            (nHeight == 118000 && hash != uint256(""0x000000000000774a7f8a7a12dc906ddb9e17e75d684f15e00f8767f9e8f36553"")))\n            return error(""AcceptBlock() : rejected by checkpoint lockin at %d"", nHeight);\n</code></pre>\nThe mechanism by which these checkpoints are added is very slow: every few months developers add them, and it takes months for most of the users to deploy these new versions of the software (notwithstanding the fact that many users never upgrade). Obviously a delay of multiple months to validate transactions and issue coins is not acceptable. I cannot imagine how an efficient currency could be built on top of this ""more efficient"" mechanism as described by Laurie, who avoids this problem by stating ""the exact mechanism by which these snapshots are established is not important"".<p>Secondly, he argues they make Bitcoin dependent on the trust of the developers. This is not the case. The developers simply record some proof-of-works recognized by the global Bitcoin network as of thousands of blocks ago. Trust in these checkpoints is 100% based on trust of the proof-of-work mechanism. The purpose of these checkpoints is to help prevent attacks where Bitcoin nodes are isolated from the global peer-to-peer network via active man-in-the-middle attacks, and are distributed an illegitimate block chain. This only solves part of the problem (only the blocks up to 118000 are checkpointed) but it is better than nothing.",1309649396

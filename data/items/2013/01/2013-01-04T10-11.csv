5007104,comment,5006967,5006967,17,0,pagliara,,,"Interesting.  I too am an iPhone lover who recently picked up a Nexus 4 to get into Android development.  This is my first experience with Android, so I didn't realize that the Nexus 4 Android experience might be different than your typical Android smartphone.<p>I was very impressed with the overall experience.  If I wasn't so used to iOS, I could easily see myself using Android on a Nexus 4.  But in the end, I walked away with the opposite impression; I saw no compelling reason to switch to Android and have decided iOS is still the mobile OS for me.  Unlike the author, I do not really consider myself a power user.  The customizability of Android is really enticing, but at the end of the day I find myself preferring the design/philosophy of iOS.  But it really just comes down to personal preference.<p>After using an iPhone for so long, I became annoyed at the small design/interface differences present in the Nexus 4 (e.g. no physical home button).  At times I found it difficult to use the Nexus 4 because of it's greater width.  The iPhone width is optimal for my hand size and pocket size.  Also, in my opinion as an app developer, the iOS app ecosystem still seems a lot stronger than Android.  Browsing the Play Store was a little boring to me.  Yes, most popular apps have both iOS and Android versions, but many developers still target iOS first and Android second.  Until there's a reason for that to change I think iOS still has the edge in ""killer"" apps.<p>That being said, I agree that there are a lot of nice things in Android that I would love to see implemented in iOS.",1357296941

5007086,comment,5006967,5006967,29,0,w0utert,,,"I agree with what the article says about sharing data between applications, this really is one of the biggest pain points of iOS right now. Fortunately, it looks like Apple will finally address this in the future, iOS 6 already has infrastructure in place to allow for remote view controllers that (in theory) should allow any application to register itself to handle certain data and events. Right now seems to be only used privately, for example to launch the mail application from other applications, but my guess is that iOS 7 will add public API's for other applications to do the same. Whether this means you can change default applications like Maps etc. I don't know, but the way Apple handled the (lack of) public-transit directions in Apple Maps suggests they are starting to be more flexible about default application handlers.<p>That said, I wasn't really impressed by any of the other points the article makes. It starts out by saying 'Android on the Nexus 4 is better in almost every aspect', but besides the sharing thing it doesn't make a case for anything else. Some half-hearted observation that 'sometimes it even appears like rendering is smoother on the Nexus 4' and 'not all Android applications look like crap anymore' and that's about it. Oh and of course you can 'customize everything' and here you have 4 examples of the most ugly homescreens I have ever seen on a mobile phone.<p>Hardly a clear-cut case of 'better in almost every aspect'. Looks like it's more a matter of preference than an objective evaluation on which of the 2 platforms is 'better'.",1357296469

I changed my mind and am getting a Nexus 4 instead. I was able to use one of our test iPhones at work for a primary phone and here are just 3 things I don't like about iOS:<p>1. Toggling settings can be difficult. In Android, you have a pull-up/pull-down menu right from the home screen where you can just turn things on/off, like Bluetooth, sounds, WiFi, etc. In iOS, you go to the Settings app and scroll through the text labels and go through one or two more screens before achieving the same thing. And this, despite Apple's marketed UI simplicity.<p>2. The thing can't even send files over Bluetooth. How is that not possible in 2013?<p>3. Boring old homescreen from way back 2007, which displays an amalgamation of all the apps installed on my phone, not the apps I use the most.<p>Of course, whichever phone you end up buying is nothing more than a personal preference.

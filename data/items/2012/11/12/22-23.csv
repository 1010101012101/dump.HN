4775228,comment,4774650,4775060,3,0,lazerwalker,,,"> What part about ""occupy"" - an occupation - don't you understand?<p>I'm the sort of person, probably just like untog, whose knowledge of occupy mostly comes from the mainstream media. I've tried to read some of your guys' materials online or watch videos for an alternate viewpoint, but nothing's been particularly helpful or clear. As far as I've been led to understand from the media, OWS is a ""political movement"" that basically failed to accomplish any meaningful political change because of a lack of coherent agenda. There's clearly more to you guys than that, and I'm sure that portrayal is inaccurate to the point of severe insult.<p>So my challenge to you is to explain it better. Or point me to someone who can. Assume I don't ""get"" occupy, because I don't. But I want to. Telling me that it's ""an admission of our insignificance in the grand design of the cosmos"" is a fantastically beautiful sentiment, but that gets me no closer to actually understanding what you're doing, why you're doing it, or why I should care.",1352760824

In fact most human organisations reflect anarchist principals at the small scale, the anarchist program is merely an attempt at scaling these tendencies.<p>>If you want to get something done you have to start off by putting in the work, then as other people see you being effective they join in and contribute their own energy and ideas.<p>This sounds exactly like a start-up and the way occupy is/was organized.<p>The spirit of iterate like mad, fail quickly and replicate successful ideas, much of which comes from modern military thinkers (for instance John Boyd's OODA loop -<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop</a> ). Such theories actually have deep utility in adversarial settings.<p>>Unfortunately this kind of organization, while good at empowering individuals is bad at quick tactical responses such as when facing a well organized adversary, such as local politicians and police.<p>I would argue this form of organisation is excellent at quick tactical responses, but generally bad at longer range strategic plans (which is generally ok, since long term strategic planning is near impossible at the tempo of modern business/conflicts). Look at the shift in military affairs toward pushing decision making down the change of command (what is often called network centric warfare).",1352760659

If you want to maximize voter's voting power, the absolute best way to do it is to randomly select a single vote to be the deciding one.  This is much better than the electoral college.  And yet, would anyone seriously prefer that system?<p>And let's make it worse.  According to demographic projections, starting in 2024 we should expect Texas to flip to the Democratic side of the ledger.  Until something fundamental changes, after that point it will be virtually impossible to elect a Republican President despite the closeness in popular support.<p>That means that the electoral system will serve to deny <i>everyone</i> the possibility of having a meaningful role in selecting the President, rather than just denying it to most of us as happens now.",1352760519

You know that the price of a computer (or TV, or hard drive, or graphics card) will fall rapidly but you buy it anyway because you want to purchase it. It doesn't actually matter much that the price of the item is deflating. And these are for <i>luxury</i> items. Price deflation of goods matters even less when it is for something essential, like basic food items.<p>In other words, what you are saying is that the price of items priced in bitcoins will fall (because your bitcoins will become worth more and more), and therefore people will not spend their coins. However, we already see real world examples of deflating prices, where people still buy these items.",1352760516

What's the net energy extracted  for the economy to do useful work with, though?  The energy (and dollar) cost of extracting oil shales and deepwater is enormous compared to the Kingdom's costs for their supergiant fields.<p>This is good news, if true, for the US' balance of trade, but sustained $100+/barrel oil will induce major structural shifts in our economy whether we're exporting or importing.<p>The EROEI (Energy Returned on Energy Invested) implications of these prices are even worse.  At a certain point, the only reason to continue to drill is because it's marginally cheaper than the energy intensive task of creating liquid fuels from organic feedstocks (i.e. - ethanol).  We'll have to have switch at that point to something else as the primary source of energy for our economy, but nothing else is even close to being ready.<p>I hope you're all ready to work like Joey Hess, netbook battery by candle light:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4721645"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4721645</a>",1352760346

4775095,comment,4769537,4771640,1,0,pp3345,,,"Okay, I've taken a look at your benchmark. The failing requests are due to a typo in the configuration. It should be ""phpsocketbacklog"" instead of just ""socketbacklog"". Pancake uses unix sockets for the internal communication between RequestWorkers and PHPWorkers. When a RequestWorker tries to send a request to a PHPWorker while the internal socket backlog is full, Pancake will abort the request due to the lack of available resources. Therefore the backlog is needed on high concurrency. I've updated the configuration at pancakehttp.net including some additional performance optimizations.<p>Even though requests won't fail anymore with the fixed configuration, throughput on high concurrency still isn't quite satisfying. This seems to me like a bug as the PHPWorkers seem to process the requests perfectly concurrent and finish each in about the same time, but then the delivery of the result to the client is somehow delayed, probably due to a problem with the internal communication. I've tested Pancake with php-fpm (Pancake supports FastCGI) and high concurrency and it seemed to scale quite good.<p>I'm investigating on this problem and hope to provide a fix soon.<p>Regarding static file throughput, I know that Pancake does not really reach the speed of other webservers here. Pancake was designed to execute PHP as fast as possible and I still have a lot of ideas in my mind on how I could further improve PHP execution speed. PHP itself isn't quite fast and therefore it is difficult to develop a webserver  in PHP that reaches the same speed when serving static files as webservers written in languages like C. I am currently experimenting with a new feature that will hopefully increase the speed of static file serving but I still don't know if it'll really work.",1352758731

It's endlessly amusing, but also a little disturbing, to me that Occupy has been declared dead, continually, since almost its first few days of existence over a year ago. And, yet, every time an Occupy thing shows up (which is frequently; Occupy events and actions are happening every single day across the US) the news reports it as an isolated anomaly (""Occupy Wall St. had one last gasp today."" and a week later act shocked, or, more likely, simply ignore it, when some new Occupy event or action happens).<p>This is another example of that downplaying of the reality of OWS; ""Oh, my goodness! You mean OWS still exists? I had no idea!"" While thousands of Occupiers help the poorest neighborhoods get back on their feet...the only reason you hear about it, is because it's too big to ignore, though there's certainly plenty of folks trying to continue to ignore it. Maybe you should be asking why the media you trust is misrepresenting a mainstream movement like this on a continual basis, and for whose benefit?<p>OWS changed the political landscape in pretty dramatic ways, and continues to do so (and to deny that is to deny reality). But, for the folks who expected OWS (and Occupy groups nationwide) to take up the ""Tea Party of the Left"" mantle, and do politic-y things, like electing candidates to office, it looks like a failure. But, it wasn't and isn't a Tea Party of the left, and baked right into its very being is a set of values and a culture that would make such an outcome very unlikely (and undesired by most of its participants).<p>Occupy folks are very likely involved in every activist community in your city, right now. They may not even be involved in an Occupation anymore, and there may not be a very active local Occupation in your city (though you might be surprised; there's one still quite active here in Austin, and I know SF/Oakland, NYC, Chicago, and many others are still active)...but OWS or a local Occupation is what turned them from an armchair activist into one who goes outside and does things.

StackOverflow may be shooting itself in the foot. SO cannot dictate the rules of the search game to Google, and Google adjusts its SERPs pretty quickly, especially nowadays, when user behavior gets to have bigger influence on SERP with every ranking algo update. Poor quality content leads to higher bounce rate and lower avg. time on site and visit depth, which will inevitably lead to lower ranking and less traffic for SO. This (and perhaps a thousand of other factors) works for every site, and even more so for heavy traffic content projects like StackOverflow. So don't be afraid, the system will adjust itself.<p>Overall, I agree with your sentiment: I love SO, but nofollowing the Web looks kind of lame and selfish.

4775026,comment,4771558,4771773,7,0,enraged_camel,,,"It's funny you call it a ""lesson"" because I learned the exact opposite ""lesson.""<p>It came to me several years ago when I was visiting an aquarium in Hawaii, out of all places. One of the videos they were showing explained the life that plankton live. These are micro-organisms that literally <i>drift</i> in the ocean and go wherever the currents take them. And in the end, most are eaten by a larger organism. One might argue that this is a fine way for a plankton to live, because their ""purpose"" in life is to end up as food for something else.<p>And many humans live their lives as plankton. Why? The simplest and most realistic answer is that it's the path of least resistance. It's much easier to <i>drift</i> in life and go wherever the currents take you, than to try to swim and go where you actually <i>want</i> to go. But to say (or, in the article's case, imply) that this is the right ""lesson"" is a bit annoying.<p>After that aquarium visit, I had about a week to think things true. And I realized that I had lived my life as a plankton up until then, and it had not resulted in much happiness. I was always <i>reacting</i> what was happening to me, and letting people push me around much like ocean currents push plankton around. In the end, I decided that I would rather be a shark. And that's when my life started to change for the better in almost every way.",1352757699

Occupy works on socialist/anarchist principles and is more like a worker co-op. If you want to get something done you have to start off by putting in the work, then as other people see you being effective they join in and contribute their own energy and ideas. Unfortunately this kind of organization, while good at empowering individuals, is bad at quick tactical responses such as when facing a well organized adversary like the local politicians and police.",1352757693

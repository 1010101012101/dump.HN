It's a bit of a drive but we decided to make the trip to save some money on household items.  It was one of the bigger Wal-Marts I've seen and it looked fairly new.  As we were leaving we decided to check out the supermarket section.  Boy were we surprised.<p>The selection of fresh produce was about twice the size of what you could find at the local Kroger and even better than our local organic grocery store that gets its food from local farmers.  They had a wide variety of fruits and vegetables and they were presented very nicely.  We found pre-packaged chicken breasts with no additives, no antibiotics or hormones, and that were fed a purely vegetarian diet; they were quite tasty and pretty cheap.  The store was very clean and bright and it was a fairly pleasant experience to shop there.  I like to eat things that are good for me and I usually don't mind spending more for them, but after my experience in the store and now after knowing that some of that produce has come from local farms, I think I will be doing a lot more of my grocery shopping at Wal-Mart.",1266868569

1143554,comment,1143394,1143512,0,0,aaronwall,,,"A couple clarifications if you don't mind then ;)<p>- If you don't want those pages indexed in Google then why are you submitting them in an XML sitemap?<p>- I have already shown examples of the 0 original content pages ranking, so how can you claim that they do not rank?<p>- You are not scraping directly, you are pulling from 3rd party sites and using it as content on your own site. Which is worse, because there is no way to opt out of it.<p>- My problem is not just with what you call stub pages, but with most of your pages. When you give people embed code to embed your content in their site you give them an iframe AND a direct link back to you. If you want me to stop highlighting the absurdity of it then perhaps you should hold yourself to the same standards as what you offer others. But you do just the opposite when you embed 3rd party content in your site. You slap a nofollow on the links <i>and</i> embed the content directly into the page (rather than in an iframe).<p>- Worth noting that every time I mention the above point you end up talking about stub pages or experiments or some other strategy to try to redirect attention. But in reality, what I am talking about is what you do on almost every page of your website.",1266868443

1143524,comment,1143056,1143406,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I <i>think</i> you've misunderstood the design pattern dichotomy. The idea of design patterns is recognising similar problems and solving them in the same way every time instead of re-inventing the wheel (which usually yields inferior results). What PG is arguing for is that you need to take this one step further: when you've observed a pattern and implemented it more than once, your language should help you as much as possible to solve it generally by implementing the pattern itself only once. The wheel analogy breaks down here: a wheel that can be cloned for free, yet customised as needed.<p>This sometimes works with Java-style object models[1], but most of the time you fall flat on your face, having to manually use filler code to make the abstraction work under your circumstances. You then end up with the situation where your code volume didn't change significantly moving from specific implementation to reusable abstraction + filler. As far as I can tell, PG is arguing that we should be trying to reduce the filler.<p>Another way to look at this issue is that the people who talk about design patterns and their use in Java, etc. usually focus on a particular level of abstraction (relatively high). I suspect the reason for this is that such languages tend to have an expressiveness trough between the micro and macro levels of abstraction. I think the design patterns people (I'm failing to come up with a better term here, sorry) have developed a blind spot for this mid-level where syntactic macros and similar mechanisms operate, simply because they can't express themselves at that level in their languages of choice.<p>[1] I'm specifically avoiding talking about static vs dynamic typing - that's NOT what this is about, which is also why Java/C# generics and C++ templates don't help that much. Dynamic languages tend to be better at this, but Haskell, ML, etc. show that that's not a necessary condition. What seems to be more important are cheap (syntax-wise) lambdas, and for certain types of problems, a way of influencing which subexpressions are evaluated and which aren't. (in Lisp, etc: macros, in certain other languages: lazy evaluation) I just realized I phrased it as ""evaluating subexpressions"", not ""executing blocks of statements"", even though the two are equivalent in different kinds of languages, yet examples of controlling execution of the latter are rare for some reason.",1266867756

It looks like the policy is in place to keep you from having to perform multiple clicks to get where you want.  In the common use case (I visit Google.com, type a search, get a result) I do not have to click on anything more than the search result to get where I am going.  The difference is in a use case where my search result takes me to a search results page, which means I am only halfway (or less) to my target page after clicking on the Google search result.  This doesn't mean, necessarily that all Mahalo content is bad, but that Google shouldn't be indexing Mahalo search results pages, and instead should link directly to the resultant content pages instead (scraped or not.)<p>Similarly, Hacker News articles should not be the result of a search done on the news title (as HN's link to the original article actually increases the article's score, right?), but should perform better if the matched term is found in the HN-specific content (e.g., the commentary we create on HN only.)<p>I'm sure that there are (hopefully) edge cases in which a search for the article title returns the HN link instead of to the original article, but that should be the exception to the rule.  Of course, if HN were to have an absurdly high page rank and link to a relatively unknown (or new) blog, it would likely lead to a result on here, instead of the other way 'round.",1266867281

When speaking a vowel, the geometry of your mouth creates multiple resonant frequencies.  The ratio among those frequencies is far more important than the ratio of the dominant frequency of one vowel to the dominant frequency of the next.<p>Consider a couple of examples:<p>1. A trombone can't say ""I Owe You"", despite the fact that it can produce any dominant frequency, and that phrase contains only vowels.<p>2. Voice ""Ahhhhhhhhhhhh"", going from a high to a low pitch (I imagine the doppler effect of a cartoon screaming as he rides by on a cart), and then voice ""Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" in the same fashion.  At every point, they sound different.  You can't take a clip from an arbitrary pitch range of an Ah and convince someone its an Oh.<p>3. Shape your lips like you would for oo as in Moon, Noon, or Spoon, and try make the ea vowel as in Squeak just by changing your pitch.  It won't happen.  You'll get the German ö, but not the English ea.",1266867240

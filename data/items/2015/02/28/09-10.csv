There are constant-power countermeasures but this is not it. You see, there are two types of side-channel countermeasures: palliatives and curatives. <i>Palliative</i> countermeasures, like the one we discussed in the paper I mentioned in my previous comment, attempt to make the attack more difficult by blurring the information the attacker has access to using randomness, but there is no theoretical foundation behind. By contrast, <i>curative</i> countermeasures aim at providing a leak-free implementation based on a security rationale.\nThere are two strategies to achieve this:\nthe first one is to make the leakage as decorrelated as possible from the sensitive data (<i>masking</i>),\nand the second one is to make the leakage constant, irrespective of the sensitive data (<i>balancing</i>).<p>So your idea of constant-power exists, it is called balancing. I worked on this kind of countermeasures at assembly code level [2] if you are interested, and there are many other very interesting papers in the references to go through.<p>> Is that also relevant to defending against DPA?<p>Yes, it is mostly relevant against DPA. Actually constant-power operations are good against DPA, but absolutely not against PFP (what the linked post describes) since it makes it easier: it&#x27;s always the same power trace!<p>> Should we think of the proposed technique as a new application of DPA? (Is Cryptography Research going to sue them?)<p>Since it seems to be done live I would rather say SPA (Simple Power Analysis) than DPA, but I guess the safer is to say that it is a (possibly new) application of the power side channel analysis.<p>(I don&#x27;t know.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9122672"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9122672</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pablo.rauzy.name/research.html#formaldpl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pablo.rauzy.name/research.html#formaldpl</a>",1425116426

Those are the ones you hear about, but what&#x27;s scary are the number of company and government breaches that aren&#x27;t made public. The cost of a zero-day is in the low to mid six figures.[1] If you are a juicy enough target, you <i>will</i> get hacked.<p>Obviously, this doesn&#x27;t mean one should disregard security concerns. It&#x27;s important to engage in good practices, to cultivate a combination of paranoia and attention to detail, to scrutinize suspicious behavior. But even if you do all of these things, modern computer systems have tons of surface area outside of your control. These days, it&#x27;s unrealistic to demand perfect security from anyone, let alone small businesses.<p>Instead of being so uncompromising, I think it&#x27;s better to ask businesses to explain their security policies and practices. Are administrators required to use multi-factor auth? Are backups encrypted, and if so, how? How are passwords hashed? Is data encrypted in transmission, and if so, how? Are server logs shipped to prevent tampering? Answering these questions (and others like them) can give security-conscious customers an idea of the business&#x27;s expertise, and allow people to use products (or not) accordingly.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/23/shopping-for-zero-days-an-price-list-for-hackers-secret-software-exploits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/23/shoppin...</a>",1425116134

9123254,comment,9122195,9122195,0,0,gopalv,,,"This is a good start to the conversation - PHP needs a fast JIT (& it can have a good one too), but it doesn&#x27;t entirely help that the strict typing RFC has foundered.<p>About five years ago, I started to work on a basic block PHP JIT using libjit, mostly out of frustration of dealing with the dull progress I was making with pecl APC&#x27;s speed & concurrency issues.<p>The JIT started off simple and then went nowhere for four months because the primary requirement for register allocator (and the jit_type_t SSA) is an actual type - the zval_ variables cannot sit on a register.<p>There&#x27;s an old sys-con paper[1] by my guru, who found a way to build a direct threaded JIT which could run in partial JIT mode without working out how to handle complex exception handling or making non-inlined function calls out of the JIT (the engine was called CVM).<p>The reason my PHP JIT failed to do anything relevant was due to the opcode structure of PHP which triggers a halting problem version of type-checking which both JVM and .NET IL avoids. In this context, it should be mentioned that the .NET IL bytecode is actually polymorphic (i.e JVM has iadd/ladd/fadd, while the IL has just add & add.ovf).<p>The types of the variables on the ->op1 and ->op2 needn&#x27;t be the same type in PHP, so that each opcode is actually prefixed by a routing to the right binary operator table [2].<p>This means that the memory bandwidth overheads and branch prediction mechanisms on the JIT generated code would be nearly exactly the same as the regular C implementation of the engine.<p>HHVM works around the exact same problem by forcing the type specification as a HACK-LANG type system, which allows it to really go ahead and optimize the pointless type-checking.<p>PHP needn&#x27;t entirely force strict-typing across the board, but at least needs to prevent different codepaths from ending up at the same opcode with vastly different types.<p>That one detail is effectively stopping a sane JIT from being built for PHP - because it neither a register machine (like perl6/parrod), nor a stack machine (like JVM, .NET or Python), but an opcode sequence more tied together like a rough DAG connected via ->op1, ->op2, ->result, along with the TMPVAR indexes.<p>That gets insanely complex to process very quickly as you have to traverse every-path including branch-backs to generate type traces through it - the loop could execute once where $a is an int and again with $a being a float.<p>All that said, this is an AOT engine - it does use LLVM, but is mostly entirely compiled before running (like old HipHop C++ compiler) and then does not by-pass the overheads  introduced by the lack of type verifiability for an opcode.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www2.sys-con.com/itsg/virtualcd/dotnet/archives/0103/weatherley/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.sys-con.com/itsg/virtualcd/dotnet/archives/0103/...</a>\n[2] - <a href=""https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/zend_vm_gen.php#L687"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/zend_vm_gen....</a>",1425115011

3611838,comment,3611496,3611496,19,0,mekoka,,,"This might be obvious to some, but I've literally only realized a few months ago that when I write text, I will consult a thesaurus, whereas for some reason I've neglected to do the same when I code. I would spend hours agonizing on how to call a module, wondering if I won't need the same word later for something else, or if it might be making things a bit ambiguous for the next guy.<p>So I've started also using a thesaurus when I code and so far I'm happy with the results. It's been helpful in accurately framing some of the hazier concepts with interesting names. I also revisit the naming much less than I use to, because I'm comforted with the notion that if I couldn't find a better word with a thesaurus, then maybe there isn't an obvious one. I also now use words that are clear, but that I so far neglected to include in my programming vocabulary, because other more prevalent ones would jump in my mind and put a shadow on my naming creativity.<p>So, if you need some help naming modules, functions, variables and db entities, a thesaurus could help. Though, take care to not abuse of it.",1329729384

We've found that, since we're trying to build something unique, there aren't always words for the concepts we're building. Worse yet, there are words that are close, but not quite right!

If your function grows, rename the variable. Or refactor!<p>3) an absentee synonym<p>Maybe you've got a <i>monster-which-attempts-to-defeat-player</i>, when you really need a <i>baddie</i>. Or maybe the word you need doesn't exist yet? It's rare, but sometimes you really do need to invent or repurpose a word.<p>...<p>I always feel dirty when I have a long variable name. pg writes about this in On Lisp: long names <i>feel heavier</i>. They might be super cheap to call, but because the name is long, you're less likely to call it.<p>Furthermore, I much rather adhere to a line length limit, as I find wrapping lines far harder to read than lines with short variable names. Long names makes this harder.<p>All that said, I almost <i>never</i> use abbreviations other than standin variables like a single letter. The only exception to this is well known abbreviations, like for your most commonly used utility functions or for objects which are extremely common in your problem domain.

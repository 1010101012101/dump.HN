Now I'm thinking about unsubscribing from Netflix.  I like what he says about needing a break: you just need to exercise another part of your brain.  And that is what I've discovered to be the solution for work-life balance: take a break from work, and immerse yourself in family time, so that you can return to work refreshed.  You shouldn't feel guilty for missing out on work while with your family, nor guilty for working while not being with your family, as long as there is balance, because you need to satisfy different needs at different times, and it helps you return to full power.",1304949470

2528693,comment,2527949,2528183,1,0,Symmetry,,,"I think most people's definition of ""free market"" is that people can sell or not sell their property or services for whatever price they wish - not that any good or service is legal to own or produce.  People sometimes, but not always, lump the right not to have your property or labour taken from you under the term ""free market"" and sometimes just lump not having it taken from you except for monetary taxes (as opposed to taxes in kind or forced labour).  Some people also lump freedom of contract under the rubric of ""free market"".<p>The generally accepted term for everything, including murder and conspiracy to murder, being legal is ""anarchy"" and if people still have free markets in this anarchy thats generally referred to as ""anarcho-capitalism"".  Though nothing about having a free market says that murder is legal and probably says that forcing another person to work for you using the threat of violence is illegal.  I can certainly see arguing that a free market implies legal prostitution, however, since unmarried sex is legal in most places.<p>EDIT:  And as to Capitalism, well to quote Wikipedia: ""There is no consensus on the precise definition of capitalism, nor how the term should be used as an historical category.""",1304949255

I've lived here my whole life (almost 40 years now, sheesh), and some parts have gotten more interesting.  The embarcadero has gotten much more appealing.  The decision to not rebuild the old freeway was a good one - now there's a long bayside path from the restored ferry building past the new ballpark (one of the nicest in the country, I think), and then finally down past the new UCSF biomed campus (which will be producing some mind blowing work).  This will be a pretty incredible new neighborhood.  I also think that crissy field is a more appealing place than it was when I was a kid, and the long walk from the presidio (fort point under the bridge through fort mason contains ""old stuff"" that is very evocative).<p>Market Street around civic center is appalling, and it spills over into Powell street and the Embarcadero near market enough that those spots are clearly tarnished, especially in the eyes of visitors.  But pretty much every corner of the city suffers from blight - the new Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park or the De Young may sparkle (a little too much for my taste), but the appeal of the park is diminished by the presence of a large homeless population (including stray pit bulls).  Maybe these things are more noticeably to newcomers now?<p>While it may seem a little facile to blame too much on one problem, I don't think you can understate how severe an impact the ""hardcore homeless"" population has had on SF.  Not only does it create blight, it's also a big drain on our finances.  SF is in a tough spot here.  It's a liberal city that has friendlier homeless policies, but unfortunately, that makes us a magnet.<p>As for New York... lived there for only 6 months, but Mahnattan is truly a vibrant place.

It matters to firms and recruiters and if that wasn't shitty enough, LinkedIn will rank higher in search engine results for your name that something you might have published yourself. In return, I give employees bonus points for getting to the top of search results on their own, using their own skills and not a fill-in the blanks template profile site.<p>That correlates to my main question of: why is LinkedIn valuable to the tune of $35 / share? Is it because they just started to rake in some profits for the first time from their job listing service ? Is it the secondmarket hype ? Is it because Sequoia capital has it in their best interest ? Maybe it's just because they re-branded their service as hiring solutions, added value to advertisers and rode the wave that Facebook created.<p>Do away with it and invest time in making an employee/career profile for yourself. It's a joke how LinkedIn is more of the same that didn't work for employees in the past.",1304946636

Couldn't ever get used to Mac. It feels a bit like linux (being BSD based and all that), but gets touchy when you actually try to do something with it. Though this may simply come from my lack of experience with the platform. And im not convinced that the productivity increase from switching from linux to mac is worth the investment(in short i can do the same thing on a system that is twice as cheap ,and without any extra learning).<p>However I do agree that Windows is very often disastrous in terms of productivity.",1304946536

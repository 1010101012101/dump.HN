Massive insecurity, I guess.<p>I routinely notice when someone is smarter than me, or has a better memory than me, or who can visualize complex logical structures better than me. It sucks (for me, in this instance), but that's just the way it is.",1197712387

Historically, I think most of the time food shortage was caused by climate problems (bad weather, eroding soils, etc).  I just wanted to make the point that the market will not always be able to provide what everybody needs, simply because the market can not provide more than what is available. <p>Interesting point about the compensation rates, but I'd like to think more about the issue before accepting the argument (note that I don't claim that there is a shortage of programmers).",1197711723

89828,comment,89641,89802,0,0,big-j,,,"Regarding finding a ""co-founder""... could you please elaborate on what that means? That is, I'm someone who might be interested in getting together with someone with complementary skills. Do I have my own lawyer put together some kind of founder's agreement? Or do you use the other party's lawer -- who's forming the legal paperwork for the business entity -- and have them add you in somehow (eg., as an LLC member)?<p>I know one successful fellow who used no paperwork or contract at all and everything worked out well (so far), but the ""real founder"" (who's name was on everything) could've easily taken him to the cleaners.",1197710532

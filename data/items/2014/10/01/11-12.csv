You don&#x27;t get dedicated hardware for $1/mo.<p>With over-subscription, it&#x27;s a mathematical fact that you cannot use all the processing power you&#x27;ve seemingly been given. The VPS provider <i>could</i> just give you only as much CPU power as you can use at any time (effectively <i>1/n</i> the total power with <i>n</i> users) -- but that would be terribly inefficient (most of the CPU power would be unused at any given time).<p>This isn&#x27;t for everyone, of course, but I don&#x27;t see a reason to criticize this business model when it delivers a definite advantage: lower prices.<p>If you don&#x27;t like the trade-off of a lower price at the cost of not being able to use as much CPU power or RAM as you like, you may choose a service with less or no over-subscription. But I don&#x27;t see how that subtracts from what this service has to offer.",1412164762

8393835,comment,8389477,8393677,2,0,lsc,,,">You might want to look into moving backups to an offsite location. Datacenter administration 101, if there&#x27;s a fire or an earthquake or any other natural disaster, you definitely don&#x27;t want to lose all your data because it was all in the same place. Just a &quot;different machine&quot; doesn&#x27;t cut it.<p>You know how often earthquakes happen?  fires?<p>You should guard against the common things first.  Sysadmin error is a way more common way to lose data than earthquakes or fires.   hostile compromise is also a lot more common.<p>Having the data on another server (rather than in a snapshot) is a good first step because it protects you from RAID screwups, and sysadmin error in whatever snapshot layer you use.<p>Generally speaking a reasonable defense against  compromise is a reasonable defense against sysadmin error... best practices (and I know of no vps provider, including myself, that actually adheres to these best practices.)   are to set up your backups so that the production root can not overwrite or delete old backups.   Ideally, no one employee has write access to both production and backups, that way no one person, even if their credentials are compromised by a hostile, or even if they become hostile, can wipe all your data. (note, <i>this</i> requires an off-site backup.  Physical access is write access, but this really only protects you from an employee who is willing to risk jail time to hurt you, and while that happens, it&#x27;s pretty rare compared to an employee&#x27;s login credentials being compromised.     I would setup protection so that no one employee can overwrite both production and backup remotely before spending the effort and money to haul all my backups to another location.)<p>But like I said, as far as I know, nobody actually does that (and its a difficult sort of thing to verify.)   -  for the low end VPS market?  if they have backups on another server (rather than in a snapshot or something on the same server)  they are doing okay.<p>But really... if you care? you should do your own backups.  As a customer, you don&#x27;t have any choice about letting your hosting provider have write-access to production.  Make sure you have a backup somewhere that they don&#x27;t have access.",1412164391

8393809,comment,8392625,8392625,1,0,wcarss,,,"After running across this game a few days ago, I became curious if playing it would develop any sort of skill, or at least if my scores would improve over time.<p>Over about a week of casual (and briefly, obsessive) playing, I kept track of my scores in a text file.<p>Within 30 games or so, my score had climbed from 26 on the first game to normally 42-44, topping at 46. Over probably 50 more games, I did not notice any further increase in average or top score.<p>During that second block of 50ish games, the novelty of keeping track wore off, and I deleted the file. If I play now (after a few hundred games), I am still hoping for a high 40s score, and feel as though I have made serious mistakes with a score in the low 30s.<p>Other factors to consider: I have been &quot;watching&quot; television through most of the games (>70%), which is to say listening and occasionally glancing from the game to the show. Also, I noted some games where I spent time speaking out loud to other people in the room, and found that my scores were consistently lower on those (29-33).<p>From this (pathetic) study, it appears that the skill of playing this game can be developed through casual effort, but only to a limited extent. The structure of the game -- specifically, failing to continue to get harder past score 32 or so -- may contribute to this.<p>The skill being improved may or may not be colour-difference detection, because mouse accuracy and speed of decision matter a lot in this game as well.<p>/pretending to run a study",1412163788

I mean, here it is in C, not noted for its richly expressive terseness:<p><pre><code>  double norm(void) {\n    while (1) {\n      double u=rand01(), v=rand01();\n      double s = u*u+v*v;\n      if (0 < s && s <= 1) return u * sqrt(-2*log(s)/s);\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n(I assumed that we already had a rand01() function equivalent to your &quot;u&quot;; I suggest that in any nontrivial program the gain in brevity from the single-character name is outweighed by being unable to call a local variable &quot;u&quot; and, if you have a bunch of these, the cognitive load of remembering what all the single-character names mean.)<p>I bet the C implementation is distinctly easier to make sense of for most mathematicians and most programmers, and it&#x27;s not even substantially longer. (APL: 94 non-blank characters. C: 111 non-blank characters. I remark that counting non-blank characters is about as favourable a metric for APL as one can reasonably ask for.) One can code-golf it further: combine the declaration of u,v with that of s (saves 5 non-blank characters --> 106); switch to your &quot;u&quot; instead of my &quot;rand01&quot; and rename u,v to (say) x,y (saves 10 characters --> 96); convert to do/while and use commas instead of {;;;} for body (saves 4 characters -> 92). That looks like this, and I think is still pretty easy to read:<p><pre><code>  double norm(void) {\n    double x,y,s;\n    do x=u(), y=u(), s=x*x+y*y; while (s==0 || s>1);\n    return x*sqrt(-2*log(s)/s);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n(Note: character-counting is by hand and it&#x27;s entirely possible I&#x27;m out by a couple of chars either way.)<p>[EDITED to fix formatting screwage; aargh, I hate HN&#x27;s treatment of asterisks]",1412163633

If Bash is safe and if rudimentary precautions are taken, any variable-assigned text string is benign.<p>Not so for Shellshock, which is why it caused such consternation among Website operators.<p>Here&#x27;s an online reference that makes the same points I do, and even uses the same example of reading /etc/passwd:<p><a href=""https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-shellshock/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-shellshock/</a>",1412163497

8393726,comment,8388282,8393498,2,0,burntsushi,,,"> It&#x27;s like saying that functions aren&#x27;t free.<p>They aren&#x27;t free...<p>I literally don&#x27;t know what to say here. The whole point is to analyze the <i>trade offs</i> of generics rather than start out with a judgment that they are always worth it. In order to have generics supported in a language, you <i>must</i> pay for it some way or another. If you just box all of the values like (I think) you&#x27;re suggesting and provide compiler support for it, then programs that use generics are going to pay a cost in runtime performance <i>compared to programs that don&#x27;t use them</i>. In other implementations of generics, it&#x27;s possible to remove that runtime cost (or almost remove), but usually at the cost of something else like implementation complexity or compiler speed. Programs that use generics with that implementation choice <i>won&#x27;t pay a runtime cost compared to programs that don&#x27;t use them</i>. This obviously has a significant impact on the decision procedure of whether to use generics or not at any given point in your program.<p>And yes, absolutely, saying generics has a cost is <i>exactly</i> like saying functions have a cost. The only difference between them is that there is clearly still a substantive amount of disagreement over whether full blown generics is always worth its weight in value (compared to the <i>cost</i> of not having them).<p>Currently, Go does not have anything resembling the term &quot;generics.&quot; (Except for a few built in types and functions defined in the language specification.)",1412161691

Who would lend NOW a bunch of (IT) guys money for a startup. A bank ?!?!  No! Rather the mob. 
The reason why Viaweb/MS/Apple were succesfull is that they invented / did stuff that didn't existed at that point. You /They created a market where there was none. Back in these days there was a small amount of technology and a small group of people who understood it. Nowadays it's much tougher with competition from anywhere and anyone has access to loads of information and technology.

338941,comment,338581,338926,0,0,designtofly,,,"Yes, it is generally true. There is not a big dependence on flight speed because the inlet on jet engines slows down the flow before it enters the engine. So even though an airliner might be flying at Mach 0.85, the face of the engine only sees about Mach 0.3. The reason the duct improves the thrust of the engine is because it reduces the pressure losses (improves efficiency). A fan (or any stage in the engine compressor) increases the pressure of the air. Since air moves from high pressure to lower pressure, the air that you just pressurized wants to sneak back around to the front of the fan around the tips. By putting a duct around the fan, you help keep air from sneaking back and robbing you of the work that you just did on it. In fact, the efficiency that you gain is highly dependent on the clearances between the duct and the tip of the fan. A lot of work goes into reducing these clearances as much as possible. You can imagine that that is a non-trivial task since the parts of the engine expand and contract based on temperature, and also vibrate and have dynamic structural behavior.",1224600186

338932,comment,338581,338908,0,0,designtofly,,,"That was certainly a big part of it. Jet engines, although revolutionary, were developed only about 40 years after heavier-than-air flight began. It's hard to group all jet engines into a single category and discuss trends of the entire group. One grouping you could make is the distinction between turbojets (and very low bypass turbofans) and medium/high bypass turbofan engines. With turbojet engines (like the original designs starting from the 1940s), you had the ability to produce a lot of thrust at the expense of fuel consumption. These are the types of engines that you had in military jets and supersonic planes like the Concorde.<p>However, for modern airliners, fuel consumption is important. So a second class of jet engines was used that send a small portion of the air through the ""core"" of the engine, where it is burned and power is extracted, and the majority of the air is accelerated through the fan without being combusted. This is much more efficient (and much quieter, since most of the noise you hear is from the interaction of the high speed air coming out of the engine with the surroundings). The open-rotor concept described in this article is just a natural extension of the high-bypass engine. You get a much more efficient engine when you can increase the ratio between the amount of air that you accelerate through the fan compared to how much you send through the core and burn (this is called the bypass ratio). Since the weight and drag penalty increase exponentially as you increase the size of your engine, removing the duct around the fan becomes necessary once you get to very large bypass ratios.",1224599419

338920,comment,338581,338670,0,0,designtofly,,,"As a concept, there is nothing revolutionary about it. This was explored quite a bit back in the 1980s. It is a natural consequence of the physics of how engines operate most efficiently and is well known. So it wouldn't suggest that a GA was necessary to ""find"" this as a configuration.<p>At this point in time, CFD and the types of tools used in engine design do not lend themselves very well to applications using GA. CFD and other computational tools are very slow (on the order of hours to days) to run and still require a lot of human oversight to produce decent results (so much for physics-based tools, eh?). In addition, it's not quite as simple as a CFD code. It will also have to include the thermodynamic cycle analysis, structural analysis, and noise analysis tools (and dozens of other tools in order to properly assess a possible design). In a very large design space, this would make a zero-order random search method very inefficient. GA are best when the evaluation of the fitness function is computationally inexpensive. That's not to say that there are no applications of GA in aerospace design, but right now they are much more limited in scope.<p>Engine design is incredibly complex. The big engine manufacturers spend several BILLION dollars designing the ""core"" of the engine alone.",1224598431

They are under no obligation to sell all of them. They can sell whatever amount is appropriate to lower the price (and raise the rate) to where they want it.

The median <i>household</i> income in Round Rock is around $70,000[1], suggesting that it isn&#x27;t outrageous for a couple of married teachers there to earn well above average, even without summer income.<p>Also, at least in MA, many teachers are not required to pay Social Security tax, but instead pay into a much more generous pension system. Other benefits are also competitive relative to the private sector.<p>Again, though, I&#x27;m all for teachers making more money so more talented people are encouraged to teach.

Understanding why and eliminating this misconception is vital for FOSS community to prevent the saboteurs from getting in a better position of attack. A reproducible build by X different parties only shows that the source code was converted into a binary the same way X times. The conversion process could be malicious, buggy, and so on. The binary might be defective or a rootkit. This work does <i>not</i> mean the binary is trustworthy.<p>Solving source-to-binary correspondence is a tougher problem whose solution I linked to in a comment below. You have to deal with malicious developers, interface issues, input validation, basic compiler bugs, optimization-induced security failures, undefined behavior, bootstrapping, and distribution. These projects mainly help with just that last part whereas most compiler-related, security failures are compiler/optimization bugs. Certifying compilers plus subversion-resistant development methodology and tools are only way to address others.<p>Note: If you&#x27;re curious, the cutting edge of this research is the CertiCoq project that is trying to produce an executable straight from a specification in Coq theorem prover. Many projects that eliminate entire classes of problems rely on Coq for specification of behavior and/or proof it&#x27;s correct. Examples are CompCert compiler, Quark browser, and Chlipala&#x27;s Bedrock. These typically get extracted into ML for regular compilation. A verified, transformation from Coq specification to executable code would be quite a leap past that and the ultimate tool for proving correctness of other tools. Especially true given how many solutions like above are built with it. They might automatically benefit. Work in progress, though.",1442429738

Consider one fairly standardized resource unit - a barrel of oil. Crude oil lasts pretty well, but refined oil products definitely have a shelf life. Food commodities are of course perishable, and real estate can often lose use value if buildings aren&#x27;t properly maintained. Of course this is not to say that all resources are perishable or perishable to similar degrees, but nature does impose &#x27;use it or lose it&#x27; conditions of its own.<p>The other thing to consider is that any decision to wait has an opportunity cost, and the baseline opportunity cost is captured by the interest rate. Since nobody is going to stop charging interest to borrow money - even in <i>sharia</i> finance you pay a rental cost for money that is very very similar to interest - it would seem as if price inflation was an unavoidable characteristic of any system involving credit or loans.",1442429419

Optimization-induced defects, regular compiler bugs, and undefined behavior are more likely to hit you. There&#x27;s also been work showing how to use them intentionally to produce source that looks OK but is subverted by the bug(s).

What&#x27;s important is to be clear on your expectations early on. Go out for a coffee and gauge their interest, expectations, appetite for risk and their social standing. Go out some more to get a feel for whether you can trust a person or not. More often than not, your gut could be your guiding light.<p>I brought on a friend who shared great enthusiasm at the beginning but has decided to part ways. Still a friend but it&#x27;s clear that he&#x27;s just not into putting in the hours required.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve brought on someone whom I found on social media. We met and we&#x27;ve had some conversations. We&#x27;ve been very open with our communication about where we&#x27;re headed in life, etc. I&#x27;ve validated some of his work but I have a good feeling about his attitude.<p>Building a strong team is part of being a great leader - negotiating, motivating and building a team to achieve a goal. I&#x27;m a strong believer that there are some natural ingredients. Everything else can be moulded and shaped. Life&#x27;s a journey so have fun!",1442427242

They are not required to treat you beyond getting you to the point you won&#x27;t die on your way out of the ER.<p>Second: many of the better medical practices, UCSF Ortho for example, will not treat you if you don&#x27;t have insurance.<p>Third: bankruptcy is not quite as straightforward as you make it sound, and if you have any assets, you may well lose them.  You can have $10 or $20k and still find a $100k surgery very expensive.  For example, in CA, you can only protect $3k or $5k, depending, of value in your car during bankruptcy.

But you&#x27;re looking for a co-founder &quot;for what&quot;? For &quot;a startup&quot;? To build what? What is your passion? It&#x27;s fun to say &quot;I want to start a start up, I&#x27;ll read Paul Graham and make sure not to make those mistakes, 1) Check, 2) Check...&quot; and so on. In reality, having a marketable and economically viable idea is the key to founding a successful business. But it seems from your posts that your key passion is not wanting to work in a large company. That&#x27;s fair enough as well, but it&#x27;s not the sort of thing that makes a start up successful.<p>Find a problem and start solving it. Then tell everyone about it. A co-founder will come. In fact, they will come because they are interested in the problem you are solving. Don&#x27;t assume that two people who like sitting around together can actually come up with a viable, marketable idea and then become successful startup founders.<p>Also, Paul Graham is speaking from an investment portfolio perspective when he is speaking of the #1 failure point being not having a co-founder. He says, &quot;Have you noticed how few successful startups were founded by just one person?&quot; The thing you should be worrying about is &quot;Have you noticed how few successful startups there are? Why is that?&quot; Answer the second question first, and you will come to find it has very little to do with co-founders.",1442426498

I could also hook up my old console systems.<p>Then I might, ever so subtly, suggest that an encyclopedic knowledge of video gaming, past and present, might be useful to a heavily-followed and well-monetized text or video blogger.

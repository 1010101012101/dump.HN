5385537,comment,5378462,5379339,1,0,Uncompetative,,,"I think that you make a very important point about discontinuity. It made me think about how I could reduce the inertia of refamiliarization when I resume editing some program after some interruption. I find that I can concentrate for about four hours before my ability to maintain a mental model of the salient aspects of whatever subsystem I am modifying break down and I start to make unconscious mistakes that I fail to notice due to the effort required to direct my little remaining drip of concentration on those aspects that were associated with the initial goal. I suppose one could estimate how much time it would take to make a given change and only attempt it if you knew that you had an ample block of time to complete it without pause, but I somehow feel that this is wishful thinking and that you don't necessarily know what you are getting yourself into when you resume editing some part of a complex system.<p>Those prone to procrastination will find that the advice to ""do a little every day"" isn't all that helpful if the task requires the previous day's (partially unfinished) changes to be comprehended before you can pick up where you left off, mental model now reconstructed. There is also a temptation to rewrite this unfinised, untested, undebugged code as unentangled, ""fresh"", code is easier to write than that which is burdened with interdependencies, observed protocols, ceremony and context-dependent assumptions. Without refamiliarization there is a danger of blundering blindly into damaging changes with subtle, far reaching repurcussions, due to your naive comprehension of the system dynamic.<p>Given that refamiliarization is exhausting, I wondered if there were remedies that could reduce the time and effort it required each day:<p><pre><code>    * Allow the visualisation of the project with a number of domain specific Projectional Editors - derived from an Abstract Syntax Tree
    * Use SSA symbolic variables - imperative programs are hard to understand because they support the reassignment of named data cells
    * If you have to have state defer changes to a globally synchronised Superstep - also support the Command/Query Separation Principle
    * Use a live programming debugger to play with the system and refamiliarise yourself with its dynamical behaviour in a safe sandbox
    * It may help to use a language that scores well on the Halstead complexity measure to reduce overall development effort - Python
    * Use a WHY directed outline for code - that explains its goals through a folding text editor that supports literate programming
    * Avoid fragile base classes - there is very little point having encapsulation if you hack the heritage of an object's genealogy
    * Use Go style interfaces
</code></pre>
If all that fails:<p><pre><code>    * Revert to the previous working version and redo up to the point of interruption or pause - as it's easier to write entangled stuff
</code></pre>

While that story was pretty damaging to Uber, it was equally--if not more-damaging to the arguments made by the protesting drivers. The rape incident is exactly the type of thing that Uber is trying to prevent by being so strict with its drivers (though, admittedly, a rape could still have occurred with a highly-rated driver). For PR reasons, Uber understandably does not want to point out that bad event, but it would be pretty compelling if they said something like, ""Drivers, even if it was just one driver who ruined it for all of you, your bad behavior has forced our hand.

I'm shipping the minified js file which works on all modern browsers because the Dart team set out to bring jQuery up to a higher level.<p>I would feel very uncomfortable about that unless it's the sort of client that doesn't really have the tech background to assume you're writing it in JS in the first place. I think if someone is paying to have software written for them, they have a right to have some control over what language it's written in and what libraries it uses. After all, if they need to hire someone else to maintain it or add to it later on, they're going to have a far easier time finding a JS developer to do that than a Dart developer (at least for now).<p>And, of course, you have the right to charge twice as much to do it in JS if it's going to take you twice as long.",1363442915

Strictly adhere to YAGNI,<p>If TDD is producing spagetti code, you are doing something very wrong in your tests. The tests should be short and focused, just like your code base. Those tests are hard to write on a messy code base, which forces you to refactor, which leads to clean code. Maybe read up on the SOLID principles and other code quality practices to see what you are missing. Refactoring techniques can be very helpful too.

I remember them saying that JS has insurmountable performance problems, but that's very different from saying that JS is as fast as it can get.<p>As for asm.js, it's another approach to the same problem. An insurmountable problem for a VM usually means that there's a limit to how well the VM can reason about arbitrary code. The clever thing about asm.js is that it gets around that by just restricting the language rather than inventing a new one. The clever thing about Dart is that you would rather write in it than kill yourself.<p>And yes, of course asm.js is meant to be written by compiling via emscripten, but that means trading far more dynamicness for speed than you would with Dart.",1363442581

I'd also recommend using the upholstery tool and whatever you do, don't allow the cats tail (or any other part) to come into contact with the rotating brushes.  For a moderately dirty cat, the vacuum's suction should be enough.  If you have a really dirty cat, or a lot of cats to clean at once, try an automatic car wash instead (just make sure it's the kind where the doors close before the wash starts, otherwise too many escape).",1363442418

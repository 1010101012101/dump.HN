But there are <i>lots</i> of jokes that are pretty offensive when you think through them.  Dead-baby jokes.  Microsoft Bing jokes.  Various ethnic jokes.  Holocaust jokes.  The reason <i>why</i> we find them funny is because they stretch the bounds of social propriety.<p>I find it's better to draw a line between lets-be-serious-this-is-a-bad-thing mode and okay-we're-joking-now-say-whatever-you-want mode.  Because things get awful dreary if you never joke about stuff that's morbid, depressing, and generally a bad thing.  It's like humor is the natural human coping mechanism...",1244005170

You could just as easily have no gap between keys, but calculate a ""confidence"" level of what key was pressed based on how close to the center of the key the press occurred.  It seems to me that this layout would just turned incorrect key presses into ignored key presses if you hit in the dead space around the triangles.  I guess you can consider that better since you don't have to backspace, but a decent smart-correction implementation is better still.",1244004877

639231,comment,638999,638999,0,0,jonshea,,,"This article is extremely thin. The only source in the whole thing is an anonymous “former U.S. diplomat in East Asia”. Why couldn’t he go on the record in his claim that North Korea doesn’t counterfeit, or in his claim that North Korea makes money on the stock market? Anonymous sources are the worst. The have little motivation to tell the truth, and even if they do there’s no way to make sure the author represents them accurately.<p>The article also discusses North Korea’s gold reserves and access to the stock market. While these might be means by which North Korea has access to markets and currency, it’s hard to believe they’re a major source of income. Does North Korea have financial geniuses they’ve somehow groomed, through Communist schooling, to compete on Wall Street and win?<p>The only serious income sources that this article mentions are mining and manufacturing, but there are no numbers on either. Mining seems like it would be easy to track (it’s unlikely 
that North Korea is trading steel on some kind of black market), but there’s no indication the author contacted any experts on the subject.",1244004036

639217,comment,638091,638091,0,0,marram,,,"Good start. Here is some feedback:<p>1. What does ""Flexible learning environment"" mean? I don't think this phrase adds any value.<p>2. ""Learn from people you know and trust"": Not sure if the people I currently know possess the best knowledge. I've been out of school for a few years.<p>You need to iterate over your landing page copy a bit more. Get some help from friends or classmates.<p>3. The text on the features page (/features) is too verbose. Most people won't read all of it. Make it shorter and to the point. Also, more pictures or screen shots would make it easier to understand.<p>4. The typography of the word ""Cafe"" in the logo makes it hard to read. Black on dark blue does not provide enough contrast, and the font is too faint to make the logo memorable.
So my advice is to: a. Choose a high contrast color scheme and b. Choose a more prominent font for both words in your logo.<p>The logo also seems to be inconsistent across the pages. For example, it looks different here:
<a href=""http://www.cafecourses.com/courses/31-integrating-authlogic-with-rpxnow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cafecourses.com/courses/31-integrating-authlogic-...</a><p>5. The ""Feedback"" div on the left occludes some of the text on the features page. I realize that I'm on a small laptop with 1024X768<p>6. Hmm. Are these courses or tutorials? ""Adding CAPTCHA to your site"" sounds like a one page tutorial.<p>7. You need to iterate over the copy in the ""About"" page. It is hard to follow, and can be structured better. For example: you should encourage people to upmod great content, rather than vote down courses. Especially when most of the content is written by you.<p>Best of luck.",1244003347

It wasn’t until I started writing this blog that I began to appreciate how much good content routinely gets cut from the final product. Ideas will get cut if they detract from the focus of the piece, if there’s no logical place to put them anymore, some are even cut because they’re too interesting and merit their own separate post. I even cut a good line from the end of this paragraph because it wasn’t the appropriate sentence to close a paragraph with.<p>Of every post I write, I estimate that I cut two good lines for every one good line that makes it into the final piece.What this means is that if you’re reading a piece of writing that you think is pitched at your level, the writer had to be three times smarter than you to have written it. Similarly, I noticed that when I was speaking, I would only say about half of the clever stuff I wanted to say which meant anyone talking to me was probably twice as smart as I think they are.<p>This is, perhaps, why the internet is so full of assholes who think they’re the smartest person in the room. If you have a look at the comment section of almost any piece of content, at least half the comments tend to be some snide implication that the commenter is smarter than the author. Next time you read something, mentally assume that the author is three times as smart as they appear and think of how you would respond then. All I can say is ever since I started doing that, I’ve not only been far calmer, I’ve learned much more too.",1244002515

639202,comment,638053,638951,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"Forgot about Live.  Supports VST and AU (mac version only).<p>At any rate, my argument was (although I didn't explicitly lay it out) that he should cover AU for the garageband kids (bulk of the users) and the actual musicians that use Logic at band practice (sizable minority), and maybe catch VSTs on the way out for the Windows folks if it's not too hard (I'm not a VST developer; I can't say).  AU is where it's all going though--you've got a generation of people growing up with garageband for recording, producing, even taking piano lessons.  I would imagine that would be prime market for a chord detection app.  In addition, the GB/Logic family file format is based around chord notation (and is pretty easy to reverse engineer), so you could actually export the chord structure back into the arrangement if you were clever.  This has all sorts of interesting implications for chord-aware events like Apple Loops-- mixing would be drag and drop even for the people who don't know one chord from another.<p>Agree that Pro Tools isn't much use for this sort of thing.  I do know a couple of kids who've picked up Pro Tools LE because they think it's what the cool kids use, but it's not worth the effort to capture.<p>Another obvious direction for this would be an iPhone app that displays the chord it currently hears (and does so <i>accurately</i>).  Not sure how good the algorithm is from a bad source, but that would be worth $50 to me.",1244002247

1329862,comment,1329334,1329647,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There's an opportunity cost for every feature added, and it's not just the time lost in implementation.  More features = more code, which means more things you have to consider each time you add the <i>next</i> feature.  More features = more interface complexity, which means additional things that your <i>users</i> have to consider each time they use the site.  More complexity also tends to scare off new users.  And more features = more bugs, which is a further drain on productivity in the future.<p>Didn't we just have this thread yesterday when Google introduced a few new features that everyone seems to hate?  (""Changing crap"", I believe PG called them.)<p>Besides, the argument isn't that you shouldn't add features unless the lack of the feature would lose users.  It's that you should be careful which features you add so that you can spend your limited resources on the features that truly delight your users.  Big companies usually aren't mediocre because they're complacent (well, perhaps except GM).  They become mediocre because their userbase is broad enough that every feature they introduce will piss <i>someone</i> off, so they end up with collections of features such that any given person will love 10% of the product and loathe the remaining 90%.",1273307079

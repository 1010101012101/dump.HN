4706560,comment,4706323,4706484,3,0,mgkimsal,,,"I got bashed a few days ago for saying that it'd be a few months before real Win8 tablets would be out - that we'd only have the surface RT for the forseeable.  I was told that was wrong, and that from Friday there'd be multiple vendors offering multiple options on Intel chips offering the full support for Win8 (not the limited WinRT current stuff).<p>Come Friday - I went to a couple shops looking around, and saw what you did.  I almost picked up Win8 Upgrade disk, but there were <i>two</i> boxes, different colors and SKUs, for the same price (there were others as well), and I'm *almost 100% certain that these were 32bit and 64bit upgrade options, but nothing on the box indicated that.  Nothing at all indicated the difference between the skus (should have taken a picture).<p>And now trying to upgrade online, I'm getting payment processor failures - I can not seem to buy Win8 without brokenness or confusion.<p><a href=""http://gyazo.com/71da564b10515155cd2b1136d0ab6464"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gyazo.com/71da564b10515155cd2b1136d0ab6464</a><p>This isn't just me - I submitted to HN a while ago - this has been going on since yesterday.",1351357177

4706558,comment,4706089,4706089,10,0,gwright,,,"Lots of armchair quarterbacks in this thread.<p>The actual operation of an electric grid is a delicate balancing act between supply and demand.<p><pre><code>  -- the grid needs to respond in real-time to changes in supply/demand (weather induced outages, Germany using your grid as an energy sink)
  -- the grid needs to respond to daily fluctuations (day/night cycles, cold day, warm day, etc)
  -- the grid needs to respond to medium-term fluctions (scheduled maintenance on plants and infrastructure, seasonal variations, price of coal, natural-gas, oil, etc)
  -- the grid needs to respond to long-term fluctuations (new infrastructure, recessions, regional economic growth or decline, technological changes, etc.)
</code></pre>
On top of all this, governments can change the regulatory environment on a whim thus invalidating many decisions made with previous assumptions.<p>Back to the original article, wind energy is particularlly problematic for the grid because its output is highly variable, not predictable in the short-term, can not be economically stored except in specialized cases, and is rife with government-induced market distortions that are also not all that predictable in the medium and long term.",1351357102

I'm not aware of any jurisdiction that requires an accounting degree or CPA certification to practice as an accountant. Yet, no big corporation is going to trust their accounting to someone who took some online classes in accounting, no matter who they took those classes from.<p>More generally, I don't think online education is the big game changer people on HN seem to think it is. Modern online education really doesn't buy you anything that hasn't been available for decades through correspondance courses. It's all just reading and writing and that can be easily done over e-mail, fax, or even physical mail. People who think online education is a game changer don't understand the point of education. It's not really about learning. It's about signaling. The most important part is the degree that some people get and other people don't get, with the name on the degree from a school that some people got into and other people did not. That's what the industry cares about.<p>I love the quote from ""Good Will Hunting"" where Will points out that there isn't anything in a Harvard education you can't get for $10 in late fees at the public library.

The limit is basically the yield strength of the material, which is the point where the stress vs strain curve goes nonlinear and the material begins to plastically deform. Obviously the  fracture limit represents catastrophic failure of the material, but that is higher than the yield limit.<p>Basically, it's a material strength and elasticity problem.",1351356608

Thoughts, in no particular order:<p>- Love the build. Very solid overall.<p>- 16:9 means it's one long tablet. Oddly, it's actually fairly usable in portrait; can't say the same for my old 16:10 Transformer (maybe just better balanced?)<p>- The touch cover is, like most say, surprisingly usable. Desperately needs a way to no-op Caps Lock though.<p>- Screen res lower than iPad, but still usable. Difference not near as noticeable as between iPad 2/3, but too many factors in play to make an objective call there.<p>- Metro takes getting used to, but I like it (even with KB/trackpad).<p>- It's the first time I've seen proper desktop Gmail and Google Docs usable in a tablet browser.<p>- Performance is generally decent. Not blazing, but decent.<p>- Windows RT appears to still contain far more of Windows than we've been led to believe. Even `csc` is installed, but missing a few dlls.<p>- No SSH client for Metro yet. That's one of the risks you take on a new platform (esp. a non-Unix one), but still aggravates me.<p>- Snapping is very, very handy; nice solution to bring proper multitasking to a tablet UI.<p>- When touch-scrolling over on desktop apps (what few remain), the entire window ""bounces"" at the head/tail of the content. Odd decision.<p>- No central notification bin (like Android's shade or iOS's Notification Center). Have to rely on scanning Live Tiles if you miss anything.<p>- The back camera seems to exist only to make the iPad 2's back camera feel better about itself. Has to be the blockiest camera I've ever seen.<p>- Handwriting recognition is pretty solid. Wacom junkies will be very pleased when so-equipped tablets ship. (Capacitive styli still suck)<p>- None of the Twitter apps have really thrilled me. Given the circumstances, I'm not that surprised.<p>- OS-level share support is a smart move; similar to Android's impl but more thorough (sharing pops up a share pane from your selected app in the sidebar, instead of bouncing you out of your current app entirely).<p>- Printing is mildly unintuitive; you have to open the ""Devices"" charm and pick your printer. No one is going to guess that's how to print.<p>- On the bright side, our network printer/scanner was detected and installed immediately, with zero user intervention. Very, very far cry from the WinXP days.<p>- There's no way to see your precise battery life outside of the desktop (in the classic sys-tray).<p>- Presumably due to the use of pressure sensors vs. capacitive, the Touch Cover isn't quite as accurate without a solid surface underneath.<p>- If you're not using the keyboard (watching movies, etc.), flip the cover backwards with the kickstand out and it's nearly as stable as a laptop.<p>- The intro tells you about the basic edge swipes (right for charms, left for app switcher, top/bottom for menu); not mentioned is swiping straight from top-center to bottom kills the current app.<p>- Screenshot is Win+VolDown.<p>- Wordament can be played while snapped. This is dangerous.<p>- IE lets you swipe on the outer edge of the page for back/forward, which would be smart if this didn't occasionally clash with the app switcher.<p>Questions?<p>(PS: I typed this entire post on the Touch Cover.)",1351356432

Unsurprisingly, I spend a meaningful amount of time using CAD/BIM software. The touch mouse zoomed in when I adjusted my grip (""drawing"" with a mouse largely involves holding it). There was no way to program the gestures.

A student with experience of solving of large number of questions will have an advantage over another student who knows the subject matter but have not done any test prep.<p>In India, where I come from, this is a almost a way of life. Almost all prestigious institutions including graduate schools determine whom to admit based on a test score (and an interview in some places), as opposed to the practice in the U.S (graduate schools) of considering a candidate's GPA,essays etc. On one hand this a very transparent method ,which is  important in a country plagued with corruption like India. But on the other hand it leads students to play the ""test-prep game"" i.e practicing a large numbers of similar questions. This has led to test prep becoming a lucrative business. Students who do not attend the ""coaching centers"", which are often more expensive than the regular schools they go to, will lose out to students who do, even though the knowledge the subject is the same. In India it has manifested as a problem when students from rural areas losing out students from urban regions, due to lack of these test prep centers.<p>The truth of the matter is that such tests serves as a good mechanism to condense a large applicant pool to a smaller one.

Once the left/green government was replaced with the current one, the big power producers did a nice lobbying not to shutdown the powerplants and thus delayed the building of the network. But the laws to develop renewable energies (and the subsidies going with) were not changed. Thus, we ended up with a lot of individuals, small and medium companies building small ""power plants"" with wind and solar energy. A lot was done in the North because of good winds combined with cheap land. End result, power imbalance.<p>Also, the power network is still very ""former East - former West"" built, which is not helping. We had 3 years ago a blackout of the West while the East (which includes the part with most of the windmills) was still up.<p>At the end, the problem is mainly because of the delayed investment from the network operators and they are now affected by their own unwillingness to build the network.

Unfortunately, nobody wants my money.<p>Yesterday was the big retail launch. I was on a mission to check out what my local stores had and, if they had anything that could do the job for me, buy it. I've always wanted a tablet, but only if it could be as useful as a laptop when paired with a keyboard. The new Windows 8 tablets are supposed to be just that.<p>Best Buy had one (1) Windows 8 tablet. It was a Asus Vivo Tab running Windows RT... supposedly. I don't want an RT tab, and this store didn't even have a working floor model of the one tablet they were selling. The one they had was stuck on a ""failed to automatically repair Windows"" screen. It was also glued to the display stand so I couldn't pick it up and get a feel for the hardware.<p>OfficeMax had zero (0) Windows 8 tablets. Heck, they had no Windows 8 touch screen laptops either. Or price tags. Or product specs. Or anything I could play with, really. There was one employee there setting up a display model of some laptop while complaining to another about how they were supposed to have tags for the computers but had none. Their electronics section was a joke.<p>Staples had one (1) Windows 8 tablet. It was a Samsung ATIV running Windows 8. Success! I actually spent some time playing with this one. Again, I couldn't really get a feel for the hardware, or specifically the weight, given it's got a pound of security alarms and tethers bolted onto the back chaining it to the display area. Beyond that, the specs just weren't up to snuff -- with 2GB RAM and 64GB storage, I'd just barely be able to run enough software to occasionally use it as a portable development machine. With nothing installed on it, there was only 14GB of free space -- the OS and preinstalled apps were using 50GB of the 64GB out of the box.<p>So all those trips were a waste of time. There's no Microsoft Store anywhere within 4 hours of me, so those 3 were the full range of retail options here.<p>I'm basically looking for a Surface Pro (Intel Core processor, 4GB RAM, 128GB storage). It's amazing that despite knowing Microsoft would be building this, nobody else built something comparable, and stores aren't carrying even the few tablets/hybrids they did build.",1351355286

You might be able to send their email lists an offer for the first 3 companies to get free testing and then all the other companies that respond hoping to get a free test can be upsold to buy. Also attend meetups where startups are presenting and ask about how they use user testing and hand out business cards with a discount code on the back.

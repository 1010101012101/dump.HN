2321584,comment,2321227,2321227,0,0,rorrr,,,"I recently had to install Ubuntu for work. Before that I normally used Win7 at home (+ unix shell at work via Putty).<p>Things that Ubuntu sucks at:<p>1) Power management. It really blows.<p><pre><code>   a) My laptop keeps shutting down without any warning that the battery is low, and half the time Ubuntu doesn't even know whether my laptop is plugged or running off of battery.\n\n   b) My laptop is blasting the CPU cooler at full power, all the time. Under Win it's only audible when I do some crazy calculations.\n</code></pre>\n2) No Photoshop replacement. I'm into photography and doing a lot of RAW processing. GIMP is not even close to Photoshop. There are lots of people online who try to convince you otherwise, but it's all bullshit.<p>3) Hardware acceleration seems to be often off in random places with various plugins.<p>4) I use a second language keyboard layout, and I'm used to Ctrl+Shift shortcut. Coincidentally, Ctrl+Shift+arrow buttons are awesome for text selection. Windows understands that. Under Ubuntu if you set keyboard layout key to Ctrl+Shift, the selection stops working.<p>5) Putty vs Ubuntu terminal. I'm used to Ctrl+C = copy, ""mouse selection"" = copy, and ""right mouse click"" = paste. It's extremely useful. Just doesn't work under Ubuntu.<p>6) Lack of file organization. I never know where programs are installed, where logs go, where configuration files are, and why they have to be in different places.<p>7) Little things like ""Backspace button"" = ""go back"" not working in Chrome. Like touchpad freeze while I'm typing (it just randomly stops working, even though the ckeckbox is checked in settings somewhere).<p>I realize I'm a Linux newbie (even though I've been using shell commands for a decade), so probably most of these problems can be resolved with some workarounds. My point is that they should be resolved out of the box.",1300085914

The more things you introduce may become more noise you have to deal with.

That's just a guess.<p>Also notice their TOS is getting stricter. You cannot display data from alternate services alongside data from Twitter's API.

Solar cells require large amounts of toxic chemicals in their production and neither solar nor wind turbines can provide baseload energy reserves simply because the sun doesn't shine at night and the wind rarely blows the amount you need it to.<p>At the end of the day, we only really have three options for baseload energy: You have fossil fuels, hydroelectric or nuclear power. From what I can see, we are starting to run out of viable hydroelectric plants, fossil fuels are apparently causing widespread short term and long term damage to the environment, and nuclear power has gotten a lot better over the past few decades.<p>It is my opinion therefore that the view that nuclear power is horribly unsafe comes from the same sort of thinking that leads to the belief that planes are unsafe vs. cars, ie. that a small number of accidents make it to the news, simply because they are uncommon as opposed to lack of news coverage on the more dangerous subject simply because people dying of it is not news.<p>Case in point: How many news stories do you hear about ""X died from terrorism"" as opposed to ""X died from a heart attack?"".

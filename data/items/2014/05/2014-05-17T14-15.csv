7760297,comment,7759892,7760155,3,0,Jugurtha,,,"Ditto. I was, and am a nerd. In junior school I was on the popular side, despite being shorter than the most popular dudes (partly because I was smart, I was dressed sharply and I was a cool kid: Everyone loved me (&#x27;tough&#x27; kids because I didn&#x27;t treat them as &quot;less intelligent brutes&quot;, smart kids because we were on the same level, and those in between because I knew how to talk to them). Plus the two most popular girls were in my class and had frequent cat fights for me(Gotta love women, they may want you, but they crave for validation more than anything)).<p>In High-School, my friend and I were amongst the most popular: We spent our days missing classes and playing basket ball and football, we got used to our &quot;fandom&quot;. We were known to the Administration by first names. And of course, when you were seen around a lot, people knew who we were (even years after).<p>But to come back to the point: I have been blessed and lucky in my life. I did sports (Judo (since age 6 or so to 17, competitions with lots of people, trained with many boys and girls in my club, both my age and older), football (many, many people cheering at your feats helps), basket ball, running, working out (body weight only)).<p>But I was also pretty cute, dressed nice, and was clean. These points lack to a lot of nerds (Cuteness isn&#x27;t something you can change, but you can take showers and dress respectably).<p>I was also blessed in the sense that I hang around girls since I could remember, like since I could talk. <i>And</i> I hang with a clique of older girls and guys who had me, and few other girls and boys my age with them, so I had a <i>lot</i> of socializing way before I got to high-school. Having girls have a crush on you wasn&#x27;t a big deal, it was all part of normal.<p>So it&#x27;s not the same thing, when you already had thousands upon thousands of interactions with people, and if you only talked with one friend or something.<p>There are things they <i>can</i> do, though, and it&#x27;s not to be popular per se, but if I were like those kids who had it hard growing up (like being mocked or stuff like that), I would ask myself questions and hack it. It&#x27;s not even to fit in or something, but taking showers and dressing okay doesn&#x27;t make you less smart.",1400338728

7760282,comment,7757303,7759597,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"Because, as I wrote, free software is about protecting the freedoms of the user, who in the case of hosted GPL software has very little rights, while the AGPL protects the user&#x27;s rights to inspect, modify, and share the software they are using.<p>Also, it&#x27;s obviously not true that they create licenses that make it impossible to make money - it is perfectly fine to make money by offering hosting of AGPL software, it&#x27;s just not acceptable to lock users in to your hosting offering (as far as the FSF is concerned/if you are using AGPL software), as that limits the user&#x27;s freedom.<p>Now, you are right, of course, that this prevents you from making money by locking in your users, for example. But first of all, that&#x27;s obviously not the same as making it impossible to make money, and secondly, the intention behind it is not to prevent anyone from making money, which is also why your observation is just flat-out wrong that they make a new license &quot;every time someone figures out how to make money with GPL software&quot; - really, I can barely believe that you really think that, given just how many people and companies are making money with GPL software, and have been doing so for many years without anyone trying to change anything about that: Manufacturers selling home routers (GPLed Linux kernel inside), companies hosting their file servers on Samba (GPLv3) as infrastructure for their business, software development companies and consultants offering the development of customisations of GPLed software, hosting companies offering hosting of GPLed and AGPLed software, ... they are all making money with GPL software, and the FSF and RMS are happy about it - were you really not aware that all of that is happening?<p>Now, user lockin is something that the FSF would consider unethical, and as such it indeed is intentional that you should not be able to do that with (A)GPLed software, because they consider the freedom of the user in this case to be more important than your interest in making money from them being locked in (that&#x27;s a bit like how society in general nowadays considers the right of humans not to be owned to be more important than the interest of slave owners to make money off their slaves&#x27; work--that does not mean, though, that the abolishment of slavery had anything to do with preventing anyone from making money, it was about human liberty, and that you couldn&#x27;t make money using slave labor anymore was just a side effect and not the primary goal, and, after all, you even still could hire the former slaves to work for your business, you just could not own them anymore).<p>There might also be methods of making money with software that might be perfectly ethical, even by the FSF&#x27;s standard, and which still are prevented by the GPL. Those cases tend to be unfortunate side effects of the fact that the GPL is a general-purpose license that has to be written to be applicable in as wide a range of cases as possible.<p>You might also want to read the FSF&#x27;s definition of free software (or at least the first few paragraphs if the whole thing is too long for your taste):<p><a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a><p>Also, I just noticed this more verbose explanation of how and why selling free software is perfectly fine:<p><a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html</a>",1400338318

The answer, I think, is that they don&#x27;t really want to be popular.&quot;<p>What about the athlete that wants to dedicate themselves to their craft?  The beautiful actress that practices acting and singing all day?  They are (usually) effortlessly popular.  Not to mention that there are generally some popular kids who are really freakin&#x27; smart.<p>Sociobiology is a big part of this.  For zillions of generations, human beings were stack-ranked by specific qualities-- strength, external signals for health/viability, social dominance/leadership, etc.  Young kids grow up and start this ritual-- unpredictably, they are probably less sophisticated and more driven by instinct than adults.  And they&#x27;re meaner.<p>I also wonder if kids latch onto and develop the parts of themselves that they can be good at.  Everyone plays soccer for the first time.  Some kids excel and get more interested.  Others look around, realize that they suck compared to their peers and lose interest.  Nerds realize very early that their path to praise and recognition might not be the one that the &quot;tribe&quot; broadly rewards, but it&#x27;s better than nothing.",1400338141

7760234,comment,7759892,7760155,5,0,afarrell,,,"Growing up, I think the reason I as a nerd was unpopular was:\n1) Lack of a sense of style:\n    I did not give any thought to dressing well until I took a UX design class in Junior year in college. Before then, I thought of it as something utterly frivolous.<p>2) Lack of common conversation topics:\n    I wanted to talk about military history and politics and physics. Very few people in elementary and high school were interested in that. So I got very little practice in conversation skills.<p>3) Not just of social skills, but knowledge of how to learn social skills:\n    I had been painfully aware since 3rd grade that I lacked &quot;social skills&quot;, but I really didn&#x27;t know what these were or how to learn them. I did read How to Win Friends and Influence People in Jr. High, but it taught me little about how to hold a conversation. Even to this day, I don&#x27;t actually know how to go about gaining social skills or what those skills actually are. Just one month ago, I learned that there was a skill to conversing so as to make sure everyone present had the context to understand the conversation and wouldn&#x27;t feel excluded. If I&#x27;m now 24 and only just now realized this, what other things have I missed?<p>Why might nerds in general have the problems I had?\n#1 takes money, which kids don&#x27;t have until starting age 16.\n#2 sort of defines nerdiness: if you have this set of interests you&#x27;re a nerd. If other people have these interests, you&#x27;re lucky.\n#3 is hard because it must be learned by a means that are different from academic knowledge or a fandom&#x27;s canon. You can&#x27;t really read things[1] and tinker with things and work through problem sets to figure out. Near as I can tell, you just have to have a lot of social interaction and be very aware and attentive to people as you do so.<p>[1] There are some books and blogs that are useful:<p>- How to Win Friends and Influence People (general; a classic)<p>- What Every Body is Saying (Body language)<p>- Dr. Nerdlove (dating)<p>- Cpt.

7760232,comment,7759892,7760155,1,0,Pacabel,,,"Where do you see &quot;hipsters&quot; fitting in to all of this?<p>There has, obviously, been a huge influx of &quot;hipsters&quot; into the software industry as of late. And I think they&#x27;re very distinct from &quot;nerds&quot;.<p>I define &quot;nerds&quot; as those with an interest in technology, science, mathematics, and perhaps science fiction. &quot;Hipsters&quot; are different, however, because they have limited interest in such things, but instead focus on design, aesthetics, fashion, trends, &quot;obscurity&quot;, social media, and so forth.<p>Yet there is a lot of overlap in the areas that you mention. Take the lack of social skills, for example. In the case of &quot;nerds&quot;, this often seems to be because they just don&#x27;t relate well to other people. But in the case of &quot;hipsters&quot;, it&#x27;s more about having an inherently obnoxious attitude and personality. Just look at the severe backlash that is common when a large number of &quot;hipsters&quot; migrate into established neighborhoods, for example. Even dealing with them in professional workplace settings is unpleasant.<p>In terms of physical attractiveness and appearance, we see &quot;hipsters&quot; going out of their way to look as weird and &quot;unique&quot; as they possibly can. They wear clothing that purposefully clashes. They intentionally style their physical in ways that will make them stand out, in the oddest way possible. Even so-called &quot;nerds&quot; can obviously tell that something is out of place with these people&#x27;s appearances.<p>The television/movie representation of these people is perhaps the most interesting. We&#x27;ve seen people who are clearly &quot;hipsters&quot; being mislabeled as &quot;nerds&quot; in sitcoms and other media, for example. That Sheldon character from that American sitcom is a good example of this. His social obnoxiousness is far closer to what we typically see from &quot;hipsters&quot; than from &quot;nerds&quot;. And the so-called &quot;Reddit culture&quot;, for example, may have involved &quot;nerds&quot; at the very beginning, but they were very, very quickly overwhelmed by &quot;hipsters&quot;. &quot;Hipsters&quot; have defined Reddit&#x27;s culture for years now.<p>It will be interesting to see how the dynamics of this plays out over time. Even if they&#x27;ve co-existed so far, I expect to see more hostility towards &quot;hipsters&quot; from &quot;nerds&quot;. As odd as it may sound, I think that &quot;nerds&quot; tend to have more in common with society at large than &quot;hipsters&quot; do. And I think that society at large is starting to strongly see &quot;hipsters&quot; as greater outcasts than &quot;nerds&quot; are.",1400337527

At the core of the essay is much more the truth about our modern school system and about the lack of perspective and proper incentives therein. As PG rightfully points out this leads to the creation of sick social hierarchies in which the bullies and psychopaths have the upper hand. His comparison of schools to &quot;part-time prisons&quot; is right on the money.

7760155,comment,7759892,7759892,25,0,tpeng,,,"Nerds are unpopular for a lot of different reasons. This essay seems incomplete.<p>Probably the biggest reason is that nerds don&#x27;t make any attempt to fit in. While this may seem like the same as popularity, it&#x27;s not. Popularity is the goal, fitting in is a prerequisite. Many nerds don&#x27;t even realize this. Some realize it but value their independence over popularity.<p>Another reason is that nerds are simply lacking in social skills. Social skills are learned, not innate, and they take a great deal of effort, intelligence, and awareness. The essay to some extent acknowledges this but I think it makes excuses that sound a lot like sour grapes. &quot;Sure, we&#x27;re bad at social skills -- but only because we don&#x27;t care so much about them!&quot; I think if we are all honest with ourselves, most of us would love to be good at both social skills and our intellectual/scientific/engineering pursuits.<p>Another big reason is physical attractiveness. If I could make the rules, being good looking wouldn&#x27;t matter as much as it does. But I don&#x27;t make the rules and it matters a great deal to most people. Good looks help with social skills too because good looking people get more practice. Over time that advantage builds up. This is why you don&#x27;t see a lot of really good looking nerds, even though many good looking people are in fact quite intelligent.<p>Another reason is movies/TV. Hollywood stereotypes really affect people&#x27;s perceptions of outgroups a great deal. What movies gets wrong about nerds is this: they correctly display the negatives about nerds (extreme social awkwardness) while completely glossing over the positives (brilliance). This is because most actors and screenwriters are not brilliant (other than perhaps in an artistic sense). So to the average person who learns about people from movies, nerds seem like average intelligence people who are really weird. Again, if I made the rules, people wouldn&#x27;t be affected by media. Nobody thinks they are, but nobody thinks they are affected by advertising either, yet it&#x27;s a half trillion dollar industry.<p>TL;DR: There are a lot of reasons why nerds are unpopular. And &quot;because we don&#x27;t want popularity&quot; is not one of them.",1400335736

6354502,comment,6354127,6354451,8,0,rayiner,,,"It&#x27;s not clear that we ever did pull out of it. A certain small class of people who couldn&#x27;t move away from agriculture, say Native Americans who wanted to maintain their traditional lifestyles, suffered tremendously as the country industrialized and the valuable land was taken over for industrial agriculture. They have never recovered, and are the poorest people in the U.S. to this day.<p>What this means is that people need to move to whatever is next, and those who don&#x27;t, or more importantly can&#x27;t, will be left behind. But what&#x27;s next? During the industrial revolution, people moved to cities to go work in factories. But what&#x27;s the way forward today? Arguably the key difference between today and back then is that the industrial revolution caused a change in where labor was demanded, while the automation revolution reduces the need for labor across almost all sectors of the economy. Yes, some people need to program the machines, but not that many. After all, during the industrial revolution it wasn&#x27;t mechanical engineering that offered job opportunities for the masses.<p>To me, the obvious &quot;what&#x27;s next&quot; is this: those whose jobs are obsoleted by automation personally service those whose jobs aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s possible that the future of America is 2/3 of the population acting as nannies, personal assistants, etc, to the 1/3 whose jobs haven&#x27;t been automated. I bet there are a ton of people even now who would cook/clean/etc for $5/hour + board. You&#x27;d already see this in the U.S. if it wasn&#x27;t for the minimum wage/welfare. What happens when automation drives the price of unskilled labor down to $2-3/hour? The U.S. becomes Bangladesh is what happens. I think it&#x27;s a social disaster in the making, but I struggle to think of alternatives.",1378745157

6354410,comment,6348996,6352251,2,0,lambada,,,"International Treaties are... weird. Generally (very very generally), they are agreements between governments to take certain actions, possibly with penalties if such actions aren&#x27;t taken.<p>The penalties would tend to be trade or economic sanctions from the other signatories.<p>The actions to be taken usually involve creating national legislation that implement this framework [See for example the UK&#x27;s Human Rights Act implementing the European Convention of Human Rights]. Broadly, once national legislation has been created, then national courts can enforce it [Until the HRA was created in the UK, UK Courts couldn&#x27;t hear EConvHR cases as they can only look at national law due to Parliamentary Sovereignty]. Think of it as being similar to how US Federal Courts have jurisdiction over Federal Crimes, and US State Courts have jurisdiction over State Crimes.<p>This means that an international treaty can be dead in the water despite being signed, should the national government not be able to get the implementing legislation passed - think of how ACTA was signed by the EU (and member states), but rejected by EU Parliament (and some member states parliaments).<p>This is why it was newsworthy when the US President tried to claim that having been signed by the US obliged the US to implement it via an executive order, bypassing the democratic congress (and thus, in a way, weakening the concept of national sovereignty).<p>But yes, copyright laws are broadly similar - mostly because the Berne Convention is widely accepted and implemented on a national level (along with organisations such as WIPO). An example of where the subtle changes come from is because the BC specifies that exceptions can be made for &quot;fair&quot; use, but doesn&#x27;t explicitly define what &quot;fair&quot; use is. Another example is the &quot;rule of the shorter term&quot; - when a work is published abroad as well as at home, the author only gets the shorter of the two protections, but not all signatories have implemented this. Interestingly the US was relatively late in signing and implementing the BC.<p>Disclaimer: I am not a copyright lawyer. I am not a lawyer in any way. But I do have a keen interest in the law, and consider myself relatively well informed in such areas.",1378744250

You <i>can&#x27;t</i> be 100% confident about anything, so building a system in which that is a fundamental element is doomed to fail. See also the SSL/TLS cert system, in which it is assumed that you 100% trust all the cert vendors in your key store, absurd even before we consider the default key store inflation over the years. If WoT is going to work, it&#x27;s going to have to have some concept of levels of trust. I&#x27;m willing to sign my wife&#x27;s key with the highest authority I can give.

But lacking a separate definition of what positive means, we really have no choice but to view these 5 axioms as an implicit description of &#x27;positivity&#x27; and wonder what mathematical models realize these axioms.<p>One thing to note from the axioms is that for every property either that property or the negation of that property (but not both) has the label of &#x27;positive&#x27;.  This is already pretty strong, because it&#x27;s making claims the about the &#x27;positivity&#x27; of properties that are completely unrelated to the rest of the argument.  It&#x27;s almost just a labeling game: given p and -p, you must label exactly one as &#x27;positive&#x27;.  Is the property of being red positive?  Saying no is equivalent (according to these axioms) to saying that the property of not being red is positive.<p>You can pick one model for the axioms where being red is &#x27;positive&#x27;, and then the God that&#x27;s shown to exist will be red.  You can pick another where being not red is &#x27;positive&#x27;, and then the proof implies that God will not be red.  It&#x27;s not a logical contradiction because they&#x27;re different models, but it certainly makes one wonder what the proof is talking about when it mentions &#x27;positivity&#x27;.

We are not doing ourselves any favours here.<p>1. Many male developers assume that they are in an all-male environment and behave as if they are. Sniggering schoolboy humour, edgy jokes, sexual jokes are a part of young male pack behaviour that is relatively harmless in all-male environments. In mixed environments they are not only inappropriate but they send the signal to other people that this is a young, male environment. Only.<p>To be inclusive we need to drop the male pack mentality. It is right to call out this behaviour, especially in public environments: conferences, keynotes, hacker sessions. It is also right to call-out all-male speaker-panels for the same reason.<p>2. Something &#x27;sexy&#x27; is not automatically &#x27;sexist&#x27; — it all depends where the power is. A tits-tracking app is (apart from being male-pack humour) an example of those with the power in the room making fun at the expense of those less powerful in the room. It is also &#x27;objectification&#x27; — the reinforcement of a women&#x27;s place as being an object to look at or to have sex with, rather than being an intellectual equal. The women in the room are expected to laugh it off or be subject to more ridicule: &quot;it&#x27;s just a bit of fun&quot; — This is classic bullying behaviour. As long as these rooms are mostly full of men, women will be powerless to do anything about it. It&#x27;s no surprise that the fight-back starts only once these incidents hit the internet: our community is bullying women.<p>3. A group of women ironically creating a pack-track app that tracks penises wouldn&#x27;t automatically be sexist. It would almost certainly be funny and ironic for two reasons: 1) the balance of power is against the women 2) they would be shining a light onto male-pack behaviour. Men, still holding the balance of power here, should be able to laugh such a thing off. Sadly many of you here wouldn&#x27;t.<p>4. Commentators here have a fundamental misunderstanding of what Feminism and Sexism is. They are confusing <i>equality</i> with <i>uniformity</i>.<p>Feminism is a civil rights movement. It is about equality of <i>power</i> and <i>opportunity</i> for women. Much like anti-racism it isn&#x27;t about people making jokes about each other: it is about segregated jobs, inequality of opportunity, economic discrimination.<p>Seeking equality is not the same as seeking uniformity. Just because you can find an example where women have more jobs in a sector doesn&#x27;t mean that it <i>is</i> sexism against men. It is often the opposite: low-paid caring jobs around cleaning and child-rearing. The low-pay & low-power is the result of years of sexism, as is the usual case where men who get into these roles quickly rise through the ranks and far more likely to become bosses (despite their under-representation). Some women protect these environments as all-women precisely to give them a chance at promotion. While I don&#x27;t condone this behaviour I can at least understand it.<p>Equality is the big picture; the balance of the scales. Men still hold the top jobs, the powerful jobs: Judges, Police Chiefs, Prime Ministers, Presidents, Board Members. Equality of opportunity is the ability to rise through the ranks based on ability not sex.<p>5. Most sexism is silent. We do it without knowing we are doing it. Men appoint men because the other men are men like themselves. Men know how to talk to men; Geeky men more-so. We fill our conferences with men, our panels with men, our keynotes with men because it is an easy thing to do. We promote bright young men because they remind us of ourselves. We tell ourselves that we are simply picking the best.<p>Combating this silent sexism is hard. As long as all we see is men everywhere then we will continue to be silently sexist and women will continue to silently vote with their feet.<p>6. It is sexist to say that men are better at programming than women. Unless you have scientific proof that I haven&#x27;t seen: women are perfectly good at hacking. Any woman who has chosen a career in IT despite the discrimination stacked against her (see above) is already extraordinary yet we will generally treat her less than an ordinary hacker.<p>Women make up 51% of the population, they are out-performing men in school & university here in the UK and they should therefore be over 50% of our community. But they are not. This is somebody&#x27;s fault and it is most probably ours. We have created an environment that is hostile to these bright young women and it is lunacy: we are throwing away half of the talent.<p>If we are throwing away half the talent how can we possibly be hiring the best? Half of whom we hire must be sub-standard!<p>Which brings me to:<p>7. Positive discrimination is the only way to go for our industry. We need to adjust our gender-balance by removing our obvious gender-bias. We are currently clearly discriminating against women so we should address this positively.",1378743364

This tells RabbitMQ to discard messages after a specified number of milliseconds. The second is a &quot;dead letter queue&quot;. Messages that are discarded from a queue can be routed to a dead letter queue automatically.<p>When we have a job that we wish to &quot;retry later&quot;, the framework re-queues the message in a secondary queue with a name derived from the original name. For example, if the original queue was &quot;prod-emailer&quot;, the derived queue name might be &quot;prod-emailer-1m&quot; indicating that the contents of this queue are messages originally bound for prod-emailer but were delayed by 1 minute.<p>This delayed queue is configured with a x-dead-letter-exchange of the original exchange, x-dead-letter-routing-key of the original routing key, and x-message-ttl of 60,000. With this configuration, RabbitMQ handles the timeout automatically. When the message expires from the -1m queue, RabbitMQ sends it back to the exchange and it gets routed to the intended queue by the pre-existing bindings.<p>The framework expects all messages to be in an &quot;envelope&quot; of JSON which lets us annotate the jobs. When we mark a job for retry, we also increment an &quot;attempt-count&quot; attribute in the JSON. The workers can them implement their own &quot;retry N times&quot; policies.<p>I haven&#x27;t thought about how this would work if we were using topic exchanges.

One problem that could be with such a system is the &quot;mixing of the worlds&quot; issue: knowing my email address, you could look up my profile and see a lot of personal information about me (any attribute someone has signed for me).<p>A possible solution to this could be to use &quot;partial disclosure&quot; of attributes associated with an identity. In an authentication scenario, the server learns the attributes I disclose (or a function there of), and nothing else. I think this is called a &quot;zero knowledge proof&quot;.  If I have to prove to an authority that the I am over 18, I could reveal only the answer to ((me.date_born - time.now()) > 18 yrs) and not my actual birth day.<p>This idea was invented and developed by Prof. Stefan Brands who was at McGill at some point, but then started a company around the technology.

I guess you&#x27;re saying that you&#x27;re not <i>certain</i>, but you think that&#x27;s the most likely.<p>I am curious as to why you think that&#x27;s the case, though. The linked article estimates roughly 500 additional deaths <i>per year</i>. It&#x27;s hard to know what proportion of those to assign to the TSA versus fear of terrorism, of course. But for any reasonable proportion, I think, I just don&#x27;t see how it works. The TSA would have to be saving hundreds of lives a year for it to be a net gain. In a hypothetical non-TSA world, there&#x27;d have to be a couple of terrorist attacks killing everyone on board an airliner each year, or a 9/11-scale attack every few years.<p>There&#x27;s no reason, as far as I know, to think that the TSA has prevented anything of the sort. The main reasons for the relative lack of terrorist activity on American airlines in the past decade and change are:<p>1. Terrorist organizations just aren&#x27;t that well funded and organized. 9/11 was pretty much a one-off event for them, costing relatively huge amounts of manpower and money.<p>2. Cockpit doors are reinforced and kept locked, making it hard to take over an airplane.<p>3. Passengers now know that a hijacking likely means that they will die, so any would-be hijacker is presented with dozens if not hundreds of people who suddenly have nothing left to lose. 9/11 counted on passengers thinking that they would survive the event if they remained docile, and now that this attitude is gone, hijackings are no longer really possible.<p>I&#x27;ve not seen any evidence that the TSA has stopped <i>any</i> terrorist attacks during its existence, let alone enough to account for hundreds of lives each year.",1378742495

Raising an equity round is tough, and its very &quot;expensive&quot; money in that it gives so much of your future success away to someone else. So when you go into your business thinking &quot;This is the product, these are the customers, this is the market, and this is how I make money.&quot; Your need for funding is limited to getting you to cash-flow break even. Then when you have traction you may find that you want to grow quickly to capitalize on that rather than let someone else get in on the market.<p>So your two times you ask for money? To get to the point where you&#x27;ve proved the product and to get the company into self sustaining growth.

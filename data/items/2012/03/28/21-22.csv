In 2003,  following a dispute between HavenCo and Prince Regent Michael (the acting Sealand head of state and head of government, standing in for his father), HavenCo was ""effectively nationalized""; Sealand's government took operational control of its servers, and everyone else associated with the company had their visas revoked.",1332971989

As a developer, of course I want to get more money from my installed base. They're easy to find; marketing costs are essentially zero. As a buyer, I've always looked at ""upgrades"" as a scam to suck more money out of my pocket for a product I've already paid for. I hate it more when I'm paying to get bugs fixed - bugs as a money-making opportunity! - and even more if I'm blackmailed into upgrading by the threat of dropping support for my existing product, which, of course, will stop working about 10 seconds later. I have some software that seems to be ""upgraded"" for a ""discounted price"" every two or three months!<p>How about you stop treating software like fresh fruit delivered with a worm in it and start treating it like, say, new cars? Sell it with a warranty. Allow me to extend the warranty, up to a point, for a reasonable price that covers maintenance only.

You do realize that the allies (not just the US) were fighting the 'Empire of Japan' that was running rampant throughout China and SE Asia, raping and pillaging along the way?<p>To use no other term, Japan was lucky to be nuked because they weren't going to stop.  They were going to fight to the last, and let me tell you (as the husband of someone who's grandfather fought on Leyte and Okinawa), the Japanese were brutal and vicious.  Millions of Japanese civilians would've been killed trying to land and take the Japanese mainland.  The Japanese were so adamant about fighting that it took a second bomb to change their minds.<p>If you said the fire bombing of Tokyo or Dresden, then I wouldn't have responded.  Those were retaliatory in nature - a punishment that affected civilians more than soldiers (specifically Dresden).",1332971634

If this milestone is completed well, there will be more work immediately. The requirements are as follows:<p>- This version will be limited to three essential features; user should be able to (1) create an account, (2) post a listing and (3) purchase a service. Additional details will be provided privately.<p>- I will have a detailed design of all the pages provided via photoshop. I won't expect it to be pretty at this stage, but I will expect it to be functional.<p>- Write beginner friendly, clean, modular, robust code to implement the desired requirements with little or no supervision. I ask for ""beginner friendly"" because I am attempting to learn RoR without any previous programming experience (good luck, I know). Comments should be used to give background information or annotate difficult code.<p>The Ideal Candidate:\n- Required Programming Languages: Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<p>- Do you have any open source projects? Please provide links.<p>- Do you contribute to the Rails community? Personal blog? Participate in Q&A?

Jeff Bezos funded this effort.<p>Let that sink in for a moment.<p>When the CIA wanted to get a peak at a Soviet Era sub that sank to 17,000' they paid Howard Hughes to build the Glomar Explorer [1] to go retrieve it. It was a mammoth undertaking which required the financial assistance of a nation state to make it work.<p>In 1982 when Forbes first started listing the 400 richest people they had 13 billionaires and 75 million made the list [2], which is about 167 million in inflation adjusted dollars [3], and the current lists #400 is is $1.05B so a bit over 6x larger even after inflation is considered.<p>The interesting bit for me is that the cost of 'getting things done' has not been going up in pace with the 'money people have' so wealth in the private sector is enabling individuals to do what used to take governments. Worse governments are horribly inefficient at doing things that individuals are efficient at (given their fiduciary responsibility to the tax payers)<p>I talked with some folks at Scaled Composites a bit after their successful X-Prize bid. A common theme was that they could have been successful earlier if it had not been for the red tape put in their way by the government. (some estimated two years earlier but I think that was optimistic).<p>And you look at the world concerns that arise when North Korea tests 'long range' rockets because building a rocket that can get a meaningful payload into orbit is 98% of the way to being able to drop something out of orbit pretty much anywhere you want.<p>Its very different world, and I could imagine folks who would sign on for orbital 'work' or excursions knowing that 5 - 10% of them would end up dying horribly. Not something the government can generally tolerate but explorers can.<p>The risk though is that you end up with a corporation that is has the capability of exploiting space and corporations don't generally sign treaties.

Your friend said something about a young girl, so you make fun of him for being a pedophile. Your girlfriend happens to have a black eye, so you get jokingly accused of abusing her.<p>I think there are elements of both. For example, if a female friend had said something about Harry, it wouldn't have the same impact, humor-wise, to imply she was a pedophile. The joke depends heavily on making the connection between innocuous individual behavior and the stereotypical behavior of the group. I suppose the equivalent for women would be ""that time of the month"" jokes. They're usually making fun of an individual, but rely on connecting individual behavior to the stereotypical behavior of the group.<p>That said, I think there is a spectrum of purity in such jokes.

We considered packaging Unity in Flash, but there are some missing features so we went straight for the plugin.<p>Our site is for 8-12 year old kids, so it's not the most technical audience. The Unity plugin installs in a few seconds without requiring admin rights--even most computers under corporate lockdown can install it. We've had a total of one customer service complaint, which was resolved with a little explanation.<p>In conclusion, just for 3D content just forget flash and go straight to the Unity plugin.",1332968475

3768313,comment,3767889,3767889,37,0,uvdiv,,,"Not actually a good representation for wind energy potential, because wind power is  cubic in wind speed (v^2 for kinetic energy per unit volume, times v^1 for volume/(cross sectional area * unit time)). So energy potential is concentrated in the ""long tail"", infrequent high winds. (E.g. 30 mph is 8x more powerful than 15 mph, 27x more than 10 mph). The distribution looks much more ""uneven"" -- both in space (clustered) and time (fluctuating) -- than a linear-in-windspeed map shows.<p>Off topic: if anyone's looking for a slightly gigantic weather history dataset (""oodles of terabytes""), look at [1]. It has accumulated ""a few thousand"" weather stations, at 5 minute intervals, going back ""a few"" years (I forget the numbers).<p>[1] <a href=""http://madis.noaa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://madis.noaa.gov/</a>",1332968450

It's scrum, we simply work as a team of four and ship, ship, ship, ship, feature after feature and fix after fix. We have our hands free, management is trusting our cell with the strategic future of their Tech tree, and we deliver.<p>In the other mission, I am not making this up, I spend 1hour/day on poor excuses of stand up meetings, 3 hours/day in various meetings, 1hour/day on various administrative tasks and 3 hours/day preparing powerpoint plannings for the meetings of the next day, and I'm a dev. I work with equally awesome devs in either mission, but in this one the customer is absolutely crazy inefficient and a control freak, and the best example of what NOT to do with scrum I've ever seen.<p>So who is more competent? The me that's killing it with scrum in the first mission or the me that can't do anything because of scrum in the second mission?",1332968447

He may be polluting the Pinterest 'stream' with affiliate links, but it's not like the people on Pinterest aren't on there just to look at random stuff they may never see anyways.  Obviously he must be showing people stuff they want if he's making money on it.<p>It shouldn't even be called spam since every link on Pinterest is technically solicited.  Every user on there wants to see new stuff, that's the point of the site.  It's nothing like email spam that I didn't ask for, or junk mail that was sent to my house just because they grabbed my info from somewhere.",1332968445

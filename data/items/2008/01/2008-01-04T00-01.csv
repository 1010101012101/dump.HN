94674,comment,94653,94653,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Finally, my partner in paranoia appears! :)<p>Yes, the big earthquake will arrive someday, and various things are going to fall down. Read all about it in this harrowing guide:<p><a href=""http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/2005/15/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/2005/15/</a><p>Yes, all of news.yc is in denial, which is why they conspicuously failed to vote up this guide when I posted it the first time. Don't think I didn't notice. But I will have the last laugh! My vengeance will be AWESOME to behold! THE TEMBLORS WILL DESTROY YOU ALL, AND YOUR LITTLE MACBOOKS TOO!! HAHAHAHAAA!!!<p>Having said that: if you've read the guide, avoided buying a house in my old neighborhoods (it's a good time to rent anyway, for completely unrelated financial reasons), stocked up on emergency water, and installed proper hardware to prevent your power tools from falling off the garage shelf onto your sports car (or your head), I think the odds are that you'll survive the earthquake in fine style. In the meantime, every day you spend in Omaha, Nebraska instead of the Valley is probably costing you money. And, of course, there are tornadoes, which they don't have in California.<p>I doubt you can afford the houses that get really punished by the mudslides, I don't think they have floods in San Jose (Sacramento, maybe), and the volcanoes (volcanoes?!)  are a thousand miles to the north.",1199407032

94669,comment,94651,94651,0,0,aristus,,,"I found jPod to be lifeless and depressing. In Microserfs the characters were trying to become <i>something else</i>. They may have been stunted nerds but at least they were trying. Jpod is just a bunch of stunted nerds that are shocked by nothing, aspire to nothing, and end up left on the stage in impotent rage they can't even articulate.<p>And as for Coupland writing himself into the story... it's a device with a long history. Dante does it, Cervantes does it, Vonnegut does it, Borges does it. But Coupland is no Cervantes.",1199406362

well, the menu is going to be corrected so people will have an easier time accessing the options.<p>about the drupal listing, the description was written by an existing member of the website, who thought one sentence would be enough. one thing though, interested visitors are supposed to ask questions to the user who posted the listing to ask for more info.<p>thanks again",1199406168

94665,comment,94616,94616,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The menus at the top don't work. It took me ten tries (very bad) and conscious thought (far worse) to figure out that the little arrows next to the words were the trigger for the pulldowns. I would sweep the mouse over the word and see this menu flicker on and off. I thought your Javascript was broken or something.<p>The context is confusing. As someone who happens to be a freelance Drupal developer, I was curious about the project that wanted a Drupal developer. But the pitch is one line long. There's no indication of whether I'm signing up to be a startup partner with equity but no salary, an unpaid volunteer in a community project, a contract programmer working for someone with a budget of $13.95, or the recipient of spam from half a dozen sleazeball recruiters.<p>I realize that I may be criticizing a throwaway piece of scaffolding text. But, if I am, you need to design around a more useful piece of scaffolding text!<p>I know what nonprofit-org sites are for. I know what news.yc is for. I know what Rentacoder is for. What is your site for? The whole thing is so minimalist that I have no contextual clues.",1199405719
94664,comment,94653,94660,0,0,Tichy,,,"What about volcanoes, or hurricanes? I am just not used to having my house blown to pieces on a regular basis? But I guess it solves the ""Stuff problem""...<p>I am not sure it soothes me that the earthquake possibility never crossed your mind. Maybe it is just denial? The problem being that it is such a rare event - but just like in ""Fooled By Randomness"", bad luck might still strike after 30 years of nothing happening?<p>Or are you just putting faith into your parents decision to move there before your birth, presumably they already weighed the risk for you? And the millions of other people living there, I guess - is it a sort of collective ""my neighbors must know what they are doing"" thing?<p>What about New Orleans, was that a comparable situation (threat known for years, and eventually disaster struck - how worried were people in the years before)?",1199405625

94662,comment,94591,94656,0,0,Tichy,,,"I just looked it up, but it doesn't seem to be quite the same thing? At least slurp seems to involve uploading the document to Scribd, which might really be a copyright problem.<p>I meant a way to use scribd as a PDF reader directly. But mabye there really is no point to it, because if the publisher of a PDF would use it, they would already know about scribd, and therefore would probably be better off hosting the PDF on scribd to begin with. Perhaps it would be useful for other people who want to link to the PDF, though.",1199404898

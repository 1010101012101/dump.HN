It's quite a rare exception for updated GNU software to be available under GPLv2--the FSF basically moved their entire code base from GPLv2+ to GPLv3+ when GPLv3 was released and that has cascading effects since GPLv2 and GPLv3 are incompatible.

But how could you possibly define ""communication that disparages or discriminates"" in any meaningful way? Some cases are obvious (see the above example), but what about someone who's disparaging a repressive government? Last year's Arab Spring protestors wouldn't think that they're being discriminatory or hate-driven, but the local authorities had a different view of the matter. For a (possibly) closer-to-home example, consider the opposing sides of the pro-life/pro-choice debate. Either group would be very likely to accuse the other of disparaging or discriminating against their own ""religion, or other characteristic"".<p>Furthermore, some overly-sensitive people interpret anything that doesn't actively support them as opposing them. Who gets/has to decide whether a particular instance of communication ""disparages or discriminates"": the speaker, the listener, or you?<p>Also, remember that a license is actually a legal document. Do you really want to have to defend these vague terms in court?<p>The GNU folks considered such things when crafting the GPL. According to their rationale at <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a> , the very first requirement of a free software licence (freedom 0) is:<p><pre><code>  The freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person or\n  organization to use it on any kind of computer system, for any kind of overall\n  job and purpose, without being required to communicate about it with the developer\n  or any other specific entity. In this freedom, it is the user's purpose that\n  matters, not the developer's purpose; you as a user are free to run the program for\n  your purposes, and if you distribute it to someone else, she is then free to run it\n  for her purposes, but you are not entitled to impose your purposes on her.\n</code></pre>\nWhile many people disagree with the GNU authors on many finer points, this is a pretty fundamental freedom that many or most free software authors support.<p>Basically, while I sympathize with the motivation, this just can't work in reality.

3559977,comment,3559757,3559787,6,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Imagine a GoPro-style camera which transmitted wirelessly to a nearby smartphone.  From there, the receiving app would sync it to a server ASAP.  If you knew you were entering into a situation where video you were capturing might be confiscated, you could tape the phone to your thigh with a lot of duct tape.  By the time the police organized themselves sufficiently to cut the tape off of your body, the important video likely would already be uploaded.  Could this scheme be expanded upon by some sort of steel lock box around one's waist/ankle/etc?  That would give the phone a lot of time to do its work.  Furthermore, the box could contain an additional microphone which would continue recording after initial camera seizure.  In cases where groups of protesters feared arrest, could Bluetooth be used to create a Tor-esque upload-to-the-cloud network which would eventually reconstitute everyone's video?  I'm imagining a bunch of phones talking to each other in a mesh and trading blobs which could be reassembled server-side.",1328576902

I have a white Macbook that I'm very happy with, and I couldn't imagine carrying around anything larger. I'd have bought a 12"" Powerbook if those had survived the Intel switch. In contrast:<p>> And lastly, let's be honest: did we really need things to get that much thinner? My MBP is a great size, not too heavy, and it's thin enough that there's quite a lot of leftover room in the laptop compartment of my bag.<p>There's obviously much more room for ports and other little conveniences at 15"", but it's unfair to call a machine ""useless"" if it makes compromises to get smaller than that.",1200484430

Debugging the cross-language implementation proved too difficult so it was ported entirely to C using tools which mostly moved the parens around.  Some lisp structures live on inside it to this day.",1200484399

There may be potential for a startup to help them out, also...<p>Well organized data can be <i>very</i> valuable. When the data are so valuable that companies providing them have revenues in the billions [1], the costs of distribution are negligible, and there is a lot of competition in such fields. However, there must be many not-as-valuable data sets, the sale of which would cover gathering and organization costs, but the distribution costs of which make it not worthwhile (hosting, coding of payment processing backend, keeping track of legal issues, etc.).<p>If so, would it make sense to create a website which lets people scrape their own data streams (for example, tagged and organized texts of political speeches from around the world), focusing on the quality of the data, and letting the site take care of hosting and distribution? At the least, it would be a searchable repository of organized data sets. Optimistically, it could be the search engine of the semantic web... ;)<p>What do you think, ladies and gents?<p>1.

Actually, I'd love to see Lisp-style metalanguage here at news.yc, for example:<p><pre><code>  {i This text would be italic}\n  {y:99053 This is a link to a news.yc post}\n  {r:http://wikipedia.com Click to go to Wikipedia}\n  This does the math for you, so 2 * 2 is {* 2 2}\n  Literal curly brackets: ~{ ~}, literal tilde ~~ - that's all you need to know.\n</code></pre>\nAngle brackets < > could be used instead of { } as well - doesn't really matter.<p>Not that it would be a huge improvement, but rather ummmm... for the sake of some lispness.<p>The idea is not new, I thought about a text pre-processing language like this before.

I got them both subscriptions to several online games years ago to get them through that stage as quickly as possible.  They still like to play games, but now they are into the ones they can modify themselves.<p>Recently I installed Inform 7 and some text adventures on both their computers. I also wrote an incomplete adventure involving finding the owner of a lost dog at a local park. My daughter really enjoyed playing Zork and so I showed her how my small adventure worked. Now we've traded places - she's added more details to it and I do the playtesting.",1200481589

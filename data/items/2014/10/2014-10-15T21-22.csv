Recycling is a very common approach to that problem on mobile, nothing new here, RecyclerView just specializes in recycling as best as possible.  
In order to use it, you need to specify a LayoutManager that will handle how elements are displayed on the screen.  
Google provides a linear one, and the community has already been working on Grid and staggered grid.<p>Compared to ListView, RecyclerView does not make counterproductive assumptions on what it is going to do.  ListView has been written in the Blackberry era. Its only goal was to display a static list of item. No animations, no operations on the items, no gestures. It is possible to implement some of these, but for all advanced operations you hit the assumptions that ListView made on how its items are displayed. In the end, you spend more time fighting the widget than building on top of it.
RecyclerView shows a good separation of concerns. You want to implement gestures ? here you go, implement the RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener interface and you are good to go.<p>You want custom animations on addition/removal/replacement of an item ? No problem, just implement your own ItemAnimator.<p>Many parts of the widget have been thought out in order to be customizable and get out of your way and let you build on top of it.<p>Also, it is part of the support library. Google can update it as many times as necessary and make the changes available on all terminals since it is no longer a part of the platform.<p>I am sure that RecyclerView has its own quirks and limitations. In fact in the dev preview while ListView only handle Headers and Footers very badly, RecyclerView does not handle them at all. However, it is a very strong foundation on top of which it will be possible to efficiently build an Android app without having to reinvent the wheel.",1413410298

If Netflix develops a new show like House of Cards, they know exactly how many people watched it for how long, etc.<p>A cable company might track what station their customers are watching but unless they are reporting that back to the broadcaster it won&#x27;t change programming in the near-term.  It may make the cable company make different decisions about their lineup but such decisions are often part of many-year contracts with forced bundling (eg. Disney saying you must carry all these stations if you want ESPN) so even if they do have data I doubt it has much impact.<p>2) The cable company can know what channel your settop box is tuned to, but a lot of people have setups where the cable box is essentially always on (and only the TV is switched off) and there is no reasonable way for the cable operator to know if anyone is actively watching or not without resorting to very imprecise heuristics like only counting it if the channel has recently been changed.<p>This is unlike Netflix, et al, which have less passive interfaces where you can be more reasonably sure that if the user started some content they are actually watching it and not streaming it to a TV set that is off.",1413410238

Piximity allows you to capture and browse photos taken nearby you - all anonymously.
</code></pre>
Piximity works by retrieving the user’s location and automatically sorts and ranks each picture by distance from the user.  Since the app revolves around the user’s proximity, the user can see exactly where each picture is on a map in relation to their location, even getting turn by turn directions to them. All pictures are full resolution and can be saved to your photo album.  While all posted images are anonymous, users can keep track of the pictures that they have taken as well as the number of likes and saves that each image has gotten.<p>The fast upload speeds and easy navigation make Piximity an app to share off-the-cuff moments and view pictures in interesting new ways.<p>App Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/piximity/id916510829?mt=8",1413409914

If you want to post an answer on Quora, and re-post it on your own blog, that&#x27;s fantastic. If you want to post on Quora and mark it _not for reproduction_, that&#x27;s totally your choice. If you think of it this way, it makes sense that Quora is not letting their content get automatically distributed, since once it goes to Archive.org, it&#x27;s no longer under the users&#x27; control to revoke access to the answer at any time. Not only do they not claim to own your content, they don&#x27;t even let it propagate without express permission from you, the author.<p>Taking a stance like this just gains trust from authors. If you want your writing to get mass distribution, it&#x27;s up to you to distribute it.

But I disagree with the Yosemite criticism. Unlike Linux, OS X actually has a large degree of uniformity between third-party apps thanks to Cocoa and (historically) the human interface guidelines. Apple just can&#x27;t make sweeping changes to the OS X design without severely damaging the coherence of the OS X ecosystem; design changes have to be incremental. And they&#x27;re doing a pretty good job. Yosemite brings design changes specifically optimised for high-DPI (font, line weights) and a general toning down of brashness (e.g. the new dock). I imagine the new &#x27;dark mode&#x27; (which, let&#x27;s face it, will be unseen by most consumers) is just a signal of things to come; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see a dark set of Cocoa controls in a future release too. But it&#x27;ll take time.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m glad that Apple isn&#x27;t being brash on the Mac. They can get away with it on iOS (the 6->7 transition) because it&#x27;s such an active platform, with so much demand, that developers have put in the time and money to re-design, but a similar design transition on OS X would take much much longer and I imagine would be a lot more painful for the end user.",1413407606

Part of the motivation for the Gulf War was Saddam&#x27;s gassing of the Kurds and other ethnic groups. So we knew they had at one point manufactured and stored chemical weapons.  The motivation for the 2003 Iraq War was a series of administration claims that they were <i>still</i> producing WMDs including Anthrax and Nuclear weapons -- contrary to international opinion / UN weapons inspector claims.<p>Again, I apologize if this is more emotional than typical for HN, but the Iraq War led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, billions (trillions?) of taxpayer dollars flushed down the toilet, and the formation of ISIS.<p>Here are some actual claims from the buildup to the Iraq War:<p>Dick Cheney in 2002:<p>> “Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.”<p>GWB:<p>> “The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given.”<p>Paul Wolfowitz:<p>> [The Iraq WMD Program is] “just a series of evil weapons unaccounted for, huge quantities of anthrax that can kill millions of people, huge quantities of botulinum toxin that can kill millions of people, ricin that can kill millions of people.”<p>Colin Powell:<p>> “biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails,” an “extensive clandestine network” to supply “its deadly biological and chemical weapons programs,” and the obtaining of “sufficient fissile material to produce a nuclear explosion”—“facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.”",1413406801

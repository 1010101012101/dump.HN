Nobody complains about not breaking even when going to the movies.<p>With one game you never actually end up with ~20$.  It&#x27;s either 0 or ~40$. Expected value is close to break even, but you get an actual bet going.<p>With 20 games you never end up at 0 or ~40$ it&#x27;s &#x27;always&#x27;  (524,287/524,288) something between those extremes.  However, with negative expected outcome games the average case is bad, so you odds of winning are less than 50/50 and your average win is tiny.<p>Further, many people play not just a fixed number of games, but keep playing until there stake is gone, which tends very strongly toward zero.<p>Net result, if you play just one game you have a reasonable chance of winning.  If you play lot&#x27;s of games you most likely will keep losing money until you stop.<p>PS: This is why most casinos don&#x27;t take big bets; they make far more money from people making lots of small bets over time.",1452113923

10853698,comment,10852596,10852596,0,0,jsolson,,,"The numbers in this are daunting, but I personally believe massively multi-core systems make the problem a lot less daunting than the article makes out. Core counts in big servers can get up over 100 per server for Intel (see Amazon&#x27;s new EC2 offerings for public evidence of this). Intel&#x27;s Xeon Phi series of processors offer core counts approaching ~300. Going to 300x takes the required latencies per request from microseconds up to the millisecond range. POWER systems can go even higher. Moreover, for many workloads that actually leverage this sort of compute you can do something horrifying with the new DRAM-addressable persistent storage: DMA directly from the NIC into block storage. Some (many?) high performance network adapters offer the ability to filter packets to distinct Rx queues; buffers can be posted with addresses in the storage mapped region allowing direct NIC->storage transfer. If you bake more intelligence into the NIC, you can even do things like Mellanox&#x27;s NVMe Fabrics:<p><a href=""http://www.mellanox.com/blog/2015/04/mangstor-mellanox-show-nvme-over-fabrics-solution-to-reduce-latency-tax/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mellanox.com/blog/2015/04/mangstor-mellanox-show-...</a><p>This is particularly relevant to the JBOD example.<p>Now, there&#x27;s the question of what you&#x27;re actually going to <i>do</i> with all of that data, but in a lot of cases it&#x27;s likely a durable read-mostly cache that&#x27;s effectively a materialized view optimized of some (hopefully much slower write-rate) transactional store (say, product data on Amazon -- detail pages served up at some absurdly high rate, but a relatively low mutation rate).<p>Other workloads I can think of fall into a category I tend to think of as log processing -- a high-rate series of streaming writes which are slurped up and batch processed/reconciled to some (much smaller) state (which of course may then be exploded back out to large materialized views as above). In these scenarios, presuming the log entries have low contention over the underlying state, CPUs like those I called out above are more than up to the task of streaming over the input and optimistically updating the backing state.<p>Finally, in terms of real workloads, there is almost always going to be a bottleneck limiting your ability to fully utilize your resources. Either you&#x27;re CPU bound and leaving network bandwidth on the table or you&#x27;re network bound and are leaving CPUs/storage devices under-utilized. Massively improved storage performance local to a node is fantastic in terms of computation you can do locally, but if each network fabric upgrade costs you 10x what the previous one did to keep up with the storage/CPU available per-node, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time. Amin Vahdat talked a bit about our (Google&#x27;s) historical network fabric evolution: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAZAII2x0w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAZAII2x0w</a><p>If I were betting on an annoying bottleneck to full resource utilization coming up in the near future, I&#x27;d put my money on network before CPU :)",1452113841

10853692,comment,10852662,10853089,0,0,exelius,,,"I&#x27;ll answer your question: no, the venture model does not make sense in capital-intensive industries. The entire premise of venture investing is to beat established competitors by leveraging technology to be more capital-efficient. It wouldn&#x27;t work otherwise; because using the Internet as a delivery pipeline is exactly what gives most startups their cost / strategic advantages. Infrastructure investment is expensive, and very few investors are willing to float you a billion dollars without expectation of return for 10+ years. VCs want to make lots of small bets on low-capital businesses and hope one strikes gold.<p>And it just so happens we have a funding model for capital-intensive industries: government grants and tax incentives. But the nature of the beast is such that we can&#x27;t have a huge number of companies all trying to do the same thing. That does mean that success is ultimately a result of your ability to get what you want out of the government system, and hope there aren&#x27;t too many powerful groups angling for the same thing. That&#x27;s exactly the model that VC / startup is trying to get away from.<p>That&#x27;s the thing about capital-intensive industries: generally the problems and solutions are not difficult or especially unique. The only reason there&#x27;s not a hotbed of competition in those areas is because funding is the chokepoint. And you&#x27;re right; it&#x27;s more about quality of execution than &quot;getting lucky&quot;. Some things you have to get right the first time, so the trial-and-error approach of VC-funded companies is probably not the right approach.<p>EDIT: Also, to answer your point about being attached to a &quot;BigCo&quot;, you&#x27;re absolutely right. This indeed does happen -- you just never hear about it because large companies like to keep their R&D projects secret. They don&#x27;t need to publicize their achievements to establish a customer pipeline because they already have one. In fact, most advances in infrastructure technology are funded by large, established companies in a way that makes them seem evolutionary.",1452113778
10853691,comment,10850418,10851036,0,0,sytelus,,,"Fun fact: Donald Knuth, perhaps one of the most important computer scientist of our times and epitom of rational and logic, is a very very religions man. From Wikipedia:<p><i>In addition to his writings on computer science, Knuth, a Lutheran,[21] is also the author of 3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated,[22] in which he examines the Bible by a process of systematic sampling, namely an analysis of chapter 3, verse 16 of each book. Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers under the leadership of Hermann Zapf.</i><p>From psychology theory perspective, when you are kid you are boot loading your &quot;firmware&quot;. This is the time in your life, where no questions are asked about validity of any statements and whatever is in the firmware is accepted as fundamental undeniable un-erasable core of your being. You will sure go on to learn from your environment and build your &quot;kernel&quot; on the top of it but everything must eventually reconcile with your firmware somehow. So there are many great scientists who are extremely religions and have spent in-ordinate amount of their lives justifying and rationalizing ancient verses with findings of the modern science. From a pure psychology point of view, the huge continuous dose of religions education at very early age is the primary reason why people in Islamic faith as well as parts of Christianity, Judaism and others are more stricter followers of their religion even when many of them turn out to be Nobel prize winners. So if you were ever to create a religion that would last for thousands of years, here&#x27;s the tip: Make sure your ritual requires intense religious teachings at very early age.<p>This is not to say that above mechanism is the only mechanism why people become religious. Many people do genuinely believe in presence of some greater being independent of religion just due to consequence of their rationalization process (aka &quot;spiritual&quot;). Lots of people also tend to become much more religious in older age regardless of religious education during younger age and there is whole bunch of philosophies around that too.",1452113777

The improvements from there have made them more accessible and appealing, but the forms and meanings of computer-driven interactivity haven&#x27;t fundamentally changed - more realistic 3D just isn&#x27;t as impressive as the first real-time 3D. We already passed the tipping point in terms of cultural impact, and VR is superfluous to that.

You&#x27;re making the assumption that God isn&#x27;t real. I know this assumption to be incorrect. This assumption has some support that makes it appear more right than it is, for a lot of reasons. For example: Its regular practice for parents to lie to their children about Santa Claus existing and then for those children to later find out that in fact Santa Claus does not exist. It&#x27;s also regular practice for people to make idols out of men when they shouldn&#x27;t. Nowadays there is a tendency to have a lot of very clever people not believe. (This was foretold in scripture by Jesus Christ.( Don&#x27;t be wise in your own conceit and think that lack of religion produces cleverness. Plenty of scientists throughout history have been religious. Moreover, a lot of the tools that clever people tend to use nowadays like probability theory were originally discovered by people who were religious. Take Bayes as an example of that.<p>I suggest you read the Gospels about Jesus Christ and actively try to believe that God is both real and a rewarder of those who seek him.<p>And if it feels like you&#x27;re being asked to be an idiot please check out Proverbs. I don&#x27;t think anyone can read through that and at the end of it feel that religion and understanding are opposed.<p>And unfortunately the stuff about a Devil that deceives the world is also accurate.

9581629,comment,9581142,9581142,0,0,IanCal,,,"I&#x27;m surprised at people here suggesting that brute force is the only solution. There are better ways of searching.<p>Let&#x27;s make an assumption that we only ever deal with integers.<p>Also, 66 is pretty small given we&#x27;ve got to multiply by 13 at one point and multiply by 12 at another.<p>Let&#x27;s simplify it a little too.<p><pre><code>    a + ((13 * b) / c) + d + 12 * e - f - 11 + ((g * h) / i) - 10 == 66\n    a + ((13 * b) / c) + d + (12 * e) - f + ((g * h) / i) == 87\n</code></pre>\nRearrange a little for clarity<p><pre><code>    (a + d - f) + (12 * e) + ((13 * b) / c) + ((g * h) / i) == 87\n</code></pre>\nWhat can we tell about this? Well, most of this is additive, apart from f.<p>That means we&#x27;re going to be increasing our answer at each stage. If we set e to be 9, then we&#x27;re definitely going to overshoot. In fact, it&#x27;d be probably impossible for it to be 7 (since that&#x27;d get us to 84 already). 6 would leave us with only 15 spare.<p>The greatest reduction would be 6 (1 + 2 - 9) so the rest of the equation can&#x27;t be above 93 in total. The most we can add at the start is 16, so the rest of the equation can&#x27;t be below 71. That&#x27;s a fairly narrow band.<p>Is anything hugely constrained? Well, how about ((13 * b) / c)? If that&#x27;s an integer then we&#x27;ve got to have b as a multiple of c. Therefore we really can only have c <= 4. c only has 4 values, and unless it&#x27;s 1 then b only has a small number of possible values too.<p>Neither g or h can be 1 either, since then we&#x27;d never find a multiple of i.<p>Finally, since we know how changing our answer affects the result (up or down) we can mix up the numbers until it starts to work or get close. Maybe, like countdown, the answer isn&#x27;t to simply give up but see how close you can get. In fact, we can make a further assumption that the problem is reasonably solvable, which suggests it&#x27;s not actually that far from what is a reasonable first guess.<p>So. Start with something obvious, then lets try and tweak it until we start to pass all the conditions above.<p><pre><code>    1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n</code></pre>\nb is not a multiple of c. Swap c for a.<p><pre><code>    3,2,1,4,5,6,7,8,9\n</code></pre>\nOk, so fine up through the first four. Let&#x27;s leave those as they are until we have a better reason to change them.<p>e could be 5, yep.<p>f can be anything.<p>((g * h) / i) => 7 * 8 / 9 nope.<p>We can move around 5 and 6 into this. The 8 / 6 looks nice together, both even, the only one that works is 9 * 8 / 6. I can&#x27;t actually see another solution without making a bigger difference elsewhere.<p>So<p><pre><code>    3,2,1,4,5,7,9,8,6 => 98\n</code></pre>\nPretty close! We&#x27;re 11 over. We&#x27;ve got a fairly unrestricted &quot;multiply by 12&quot; in there, so let&#x27;s see if we can decrease it.<p><pre><code>    e = 5 -> e = 4\n</code></pre>\nAll we&#x27;re changing is d then, which is fine since it&#x27;s another unrestricted one, and it&#x27;ll change our results elsewhere by 1.<p><pre><code>    3,2,1,5,4,7,8,9,6 => 87\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s double check that<p><pre><code>    a + ((13 * b) / c) + d + (12 * e) - f - 11 + ((g * h) / i) - 10 == 66\n\n    3 + ((13 * 2) / 1) + 5 + (12 * 4) - 7 - 11 + ((8 * 9) / 6) - 10 == 66\n        valid multiple                           valid multiple\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not going to pretend I hadn&#x27;t already seen some answers, and I definitely think this is a hard problem, but it&#x27;s certainly not something that you <i>have</i> to brute force. We can make clear and obvious steps towards solutions, several paths are guaranteed dead ends and there are a neat set of variables we can set to basically anything so we&#x27;ll regularly actually be able to at least <i>try</i> our answer before tweaking it again.<p>Edit -<p>Anyone want to start a pool for when this will find its way into an interview question set?",1432198731

9581612,comment,9580742,9581124,0,0,fierycatnet,,,"Jhanic states mostly. Proper meditation gave me a new perspective on Zen and Buddhism as a whole. I&#x27;ve studied it extensively before and disregarded meditation as being superfluous. I was really wrong. It helped tremendously with understanding esoteric parts of Buddhism.<p>The first experience that got me &#x27;hooked&#x27; or rather made me realize that it&#x27;s not hogwash, is the arousal of piti. The warm sensation in solar plexus that came out of no where after long breath meditation concentration and it turned into waves with each breath-in. It&#x27;s hard to describe but it&#x27;s unmistakable when you start getting better at meditation. That book covers everything.<p>Make no mistake, it&#x27;s not easy. For whatever reason I got lucky with being able to tune in to deeper meditation, some people struggle for weeks and months to get there. I did Zazen previously on and off and this never got me anywhere. Anapanasati meditation is what will get you to jhanas. From then on, as some scriptures say, the real path to Buddhism begins.<p>Even if you are not into Buddhism, the pay off is still tremendous. Here is the practical and measurable result of proper deep meditation: ability to calm your mind and achieve total equanimity with virtually no thoughts, just pure awareness and tranquility that lets you sit for hours if you wish to, with zero desire to even move an inch, just sitting still. The ability to exercise your brain like that is pretty huge. In the long term and consistent practice it&#x27;s beneficial to overall well being.",1432198366

One consequence is that inductive proofs are very difficult to automate; we can say &quot;XYZ follows by induction&quot;, but the computer&#x27;s often unable to construct such a proof.<p>There are various approaches to converting back-and-forth between different logics, eg.

If they have any computational content (eg. where the proof is a datastructure or function), this can make working with such values more difficult (eg. if we want to prove a property holds in every branch of a function, having an overly-complicated function which branches based on not-completely-relevant conditions makes our life harder).",1432197117

Steve Wozniac went to one of our football games after Steve Jobs died... presumably to reminisce about his high school days.<p>> What do you mean by &quot;toxic culture&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d say that 1/20 people I&#x27;ve ran into fit into this personality type of &quot;I&#x27;m better/smarter than you&quot; in a passive aggressive sort of way. Their opinion is an objective truth, and anyone who disagrees with them is stupid. They tend to look down on everyone who isn&#x27;t as smart or successful as them. And when you talk to them, all they give a shit about is how successful you are and what your accomplishments are, and if you aren&#x27;t as successful as they hoped you to be then they give you the cold shoulder and think of you as a plebeian or something similar.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like what you&#x27;d imagine an asshole New Yorker to be, but they don&#x27;t say anything to your face.<p>I was definitely guilty of this while growing up there...

There <i>will</i> be tech people there if the city is big enough, and you&#x27;ll probably make more meaningful and substantial connections if you actually like and connect with the city you move to, instead of just blindly moving to SV because that&#x27;s what everyone else is doing.<p>> WHERE DO YOU SUGGEST?<p>It literally depends on who <i>you</i> are. What might be the best place to build your career for one person might not be for another.<p>For example, on paper, SV would be the the best place to go because I have shittons of connections there.<p>But I know I would get depressed.

2970041,comment,2969210,2969210,2,0,teilo,,,"To call this a ""tax dodge"" is libel. Amazon does not owe the taxes. The citizens of California do. How can Amazon be accused of dodging taxes that it is not liable to pay.<p>Once again the New York Times places the blame on business, when the blame belongs on the consumer, and on the government that has made the state of California hostile to doing business within its borders.<p>If the law is re-interpreted to mean that the <i>ability</i> of another state's citizens to purchase from your business in the privacy of their homes, constitutes an obligation of said business to collect taxes on behalf of the consumer's state, then all such transactions must be equal, regardless of the distribution channel. Business conducted by catalog or by phone should also impose such a burden on a retailer.<p>Consider where this would have to go: every retailer would have, of necessity, to collect taxes for 50+ tax authorities, as state-after-state makes the same demand on the retailer. While large businesses (admittedly, Amazon being one of them) have the infrastructure in place to do this, most small businesses do not. Their costs will inevitably increase, as they attempt to comply with the burden of collecting for and reporting to all the various regional tax authorities.<p>How many brick-and-mortar shops survive today based upon their online business? Shall said businesses be required, by the government to <i>turn away</i> out-of-state customers because they are not equipped to collect taxes for their customers' states of residence?",1315411186

Many late adopters are late adopters because they are holding out for a cheaper price for those goods. From personal experience, I've done this very thing (waiting for prices to come down on a TV before I bought it). I put that money into something with a higher return for the time being.<p>But, the reason that's not exactly a fair comparison is that the currency itself (in this case, USD) was not deflating.

Twenty or so minutes later, he sent me to a link to fill out a form where all would be taken care of.<p>Except it wasn't. Just like my previous few encounters with GoDaddy, when I went to the link I learned some obscure detail about my contract with them prevented me from getting what I wanted -- yet allowed them to charge me in full. I'm not going to go into details. It's a perfectly reasonable request on their part. The problem is they have created this monster of add-on services and items, all with little footnotes and gotchas. And it's all geared to extract more money from me.<p>Last time I had a domain going to expire that I wanted to keep, I went to transfer it over to my new domain guys. The domain was expiring in a month, but I had to complete a GoDaddy form online to make it happen (sound familiar?). The only way to complete the form online was to check a checkbox. The checkbox said that once I checked it I couldn't transfer the domain for another 90 days. Fuckers got me again.<p>I could tell you a few more like that. It's always some finely-detailed bullshit that ends up with you paying them more. Last week they got me for around 180 bucks.<p>So now I plan on using the domain I couldn't cancel.

If the average American had 10+$ in bitcoins on their computer a significant number of them would get hacked on a regular basis and simply lose all that money.

I am not doubting his competency with Scala - his display of his contributions prove that. But I have found that there is somewhat of an inverse relation between a person being productive in and promoting a language to how much he disses other languages as well as extolling the virtues of his own language. I am pretty sure you will not hear such stuff from people like Martin Odersky, Rich Hickey and Matz. Guido I am not so sure, ;) (j/k, I am a Python enthusiast)<p>Now that that was said and done, would it have been a big deal to close the chapter and move on?<p>The only way such a post would have struck somewhat of a cord is if he gave specific code examples for each case as to when scala is hard, or when scala is better.

2969761,comment,2947519,2965839,1,0,sixcorners,,,"> If someone desperately doesn't want God to exist, nothing will prove it to them.<p>Proof that God exists: everyone in the world wakes up with a plate of cheesecake next to them and a note saying ""I'm sorry for all the stuff that's messed up. I'm trying my best. -Yahweh"" Done. Just an example. I'm sure an omnipotent omniscient omni-something omni-somethingelse person could figure out something equally convincing if he/she didn't want to do that. The best part is that it would actually be appropriate now that we have video recording and a huge communications network so that future generations won't have to rely on ""copies of copies of translations of copies by anonymous authors of which we have no originals"" (quote taken from this video youtu.be/DAuFJKQh83Y#t=6m , I really like the show... sometimes).<p>> There is no shortage of evidence that he is real and acts in history.<p>None of those things prove the existence God. If you pick a different book the first two could prove that Hogwarts exists. What experience of the modern church? Aren't they the ones having trouble keeping cops away from pedophiles? Lastly, what makes you think that we are going to find out that the origin of the universe (which is not yet known) has been caused by something unnatural/supernatural unlike everything else we have ever discovered?<p>> I think most Christians I have talked to have, once or twice in life, personally observed something<p>Personal experience is kind of a strange thing. I don't really know how it relates to proof or evidence. However, I do know that there are people you can go and talk to who will explain how they were abducted by aliens and had children by them. It's not hard to believe that they experienced something, but it is hard to believe their story. I sometimes wonder if the same might happen to me, then I would be one of those crazy people. Anyway, right now I am of the opinion that you need something independently verifiable for it to be considered evidence.<p>> I know what the voice of God sounds like.<p>> heard something that turned out to be false or worthless, I wouldn't just say, ""Well, I guess that wasn't God.""<p>And you are certain that it isn't from another agent like the devil? People have been communing with the Gods for a long time. I kind of wonder how you evaluate someone else as having that ability. You don't accept that the Oracle of Delphi was legitimate right? Anyway, I think you are right that your claim is closer to out of body experience claims than other unfalsifiable ones. Still though if your claim proves to be false, that doesn't mean that God doesn't talk to humans. That claim is still unfalsifiable. I also have to ask if people can communicate with God then why don't people use that to finally solve all of the differences between the different denominations? Is Jesus really against minimum wage?<p>Lastly, I didn't want to be a huge bother to anyone. I'm really not trained in any of this so do take my words as someone who is just that. If I say anything sophomoric or otherwise annoying, I'm sorry. If you point it out I will try to explain why I said it and/or apologize again.",1315407747

Sure, go ahead and buy a $14 theme if that gets you the head start you need to start working on solving a real problem for someone.<p>Except that's where the hard work begins. It's not your ability to style INPUT elements that is being tested, but your product vision and how people move through a workflow that is easy to understand.<p>In the early days of a SaaS, design and copy are probably 75% of the hard work in a MVP. Find me a successful startup that wishes they'd spend less energy on design thinking and just written more code and I'll revisit my perspective.<p>Otherwise I'll make the statement that any idea which doesn't deserve the attention of a design thinker is not likely to get off the ground because it's statistically not solving a hair-on-fire problem anyhow. Put differently: there's projects and there's start-ups. Start-ups are hard. If you're going to start-up, your future users appreciate you thinking about how your product makes them feel.",1315407623
2969748,comment,2969564,2969564,5,0,ekidd,,,"Different markets have different design needs. Luxury consumer brands will be different from enterprise products.<p>I know an entrepreneur who spent about $5,000 on professional branding for a bootstrapped enterprise product. And the design <i>did</i> look very professional and creditable.<p>Two things went wrong:<p>1) He needed to build new landing pages, etc., on a regular basis, and these rarely looked as professional as the basic branding. So despite spending a lot of money, his site didn't look ultra-professionalat best, it looked competent. And that's not good enough to justify $5,000 in a bootstrapped startup.<p>2) He spent the $5,000 before proving that he could actually close sales.<p>In this case, I'd say that the $5,000 was spent prematurely. He could have purchased a lower-cost logo and spent a day browsing themeforest, and he would have wound up with something 80% as good for under $500. And that would have been enough to start e-mailing his industry contacts and trying to get his first sale. Getting that first sale was his biggest priority, because it would prove he had a real business.<p>So before deciding whether to hire a designer, ask yourself: Is looking professional the best use of your money right now? And what happens if you need to change your sales pitch significantly, or even pivot? Does your designer understand UX, advertising, copywriting, or do they just make logos and stationary? Can you afford to keep paying them? How bad are your own design skills?",1315407621

This gives me a good indication of whether they're worth listening to or not.<p>Usually, people speaking with a scornful tone of voice (or the written equivalent) are more venting than they are providing useful information. There's no need to pay too much attention to whatever they have to say, because if it's a big deal they'll say it again once they've calmed down.<p>I've noticed that when programming computers there are very few problems that can be fixed by behaving like a dick. And those that can be fixed by behaving like a dick, can also be fixed whilst behaving in a more gentlemanly fashion. The rest can be left unsolved, politely.

2478096,comment,2475854,2475854,10,0,hellasbook,,,"I have been an on line book dealer for the past 10 years. Originally the rules about having actual possession of the goods offered for sale were quite strict.<p>Then came the megalisters - agencies with software that listed all books in print and a contract with publisher's warehouses/library supply services/factors to arrange delivery of in print books to customers.<p>Then came the ""phantom listers"" - agencies with software that spiders through the listings of legitimate on line book dealers looking for titles with few (or no) copies listed in Amazon. They then list them at inflated prices. Some of these have more than one alias on Amazon.
I think of them as the Piranhas of the Amazon in the ay that they consume the smaller fish.<p>If and when they receive an order then then try to purchase a copy from one of the ""real"" owners of the book.[Some are cheeky enough to request as well a""trade discount"" on the dealer's price] Small businesses listing on Amazon and abebooks.com must keep their ""fulfillment""rating high, so they can ill afford to refuse to supply such parasites.In fact when I requested once that I NOT be obliged to support what I think of as an unethical selling and pricing model I was told<p>1] that the buyer was a valued long time customer
and that 
2] I could approach the agency in question and - at THEIR discretion - request that they stop ordering books from me.<p>Since AZ and ABE take out some % of the list price for the the books sold on their site (as well as monthly listing fees, closing fees and sometimes a portion of the shipping charge ) they can and do make a much greater profit from the high priced phantom listers than from the legitimate reasonably priced offerings of small book dealers, consequently they are not very interested in aggressively policing the situation.<p>Now there is ""Monsoon"" and other software to automatically adjust prices on line. In practice most often works to REDUCE the price below the lowest price already listed - a rush to the bottom where books get listed for mere cents.<p>One tactic I recommend is to search for books and to see the widest range of options is to use ""addall.com"" It comes in 2 flavours ""New' and ""Used""and searches around 30 book listing services You can compare prices (ascending or descending) and also see the kind of dealers who sell the books.<p>Many listings have boilerplate descriptions ""we ship fast"" ""books may have..."" etc. which indicate that no human may have examined the object being listed.Other listings have descriptions of content and condition that clearly demonstrate that it is a""real""book from a ""real""dealer.

2478095,comment,2477877,2477956,1,0,byoung2,,,"<i>How does it handle the possible inconsistency due to the asynchronous replication?</i><p>That would be a big question for me.  I can sync databases easily and instantaneously within an availability zone, and nearly instantaneously across availability zones within a region.  But once I have to replicate across regions, I add latency to the mix.  If replication from US-East to US-West is asynchronous, how would I reconcile the two?  I suppose with a catastrophic failure of the primary database in US-East, I could just write off any data that wasn't replicated before the failure, but that doesn't seem like a solid solution.  Would it be better to write a transaction layer into the app, so that data isn't considered committed until it has been written and replicated across multiple regions?",1303610082

According to proponents of the petrodollar warfare hypothesis, because most countries rely on oil imports, they are forced to maintain large stockpiles of dollars in order to continue imports. This creates a consistent demand for USDs and upwards pressure on the USD's value, regardless of economic conditions in the United States. This in turn allegedly allows the US government to gain revenues through seignorage and by issuing bonds at lower interest rates than they otherwise would be able to. As a result the U.S. government can run higher budget deficits at a more sustainable level than can most other countries. A stronger USD also means that goods imported into the United States are relatively cheap.""",1303607444

I argued in the opening chapter of Animal Liberation that humans and animals are equal in the sense that the fact that a being is human does not mean that we should give the interests of that being preference over the similar interests of other beings. That would be speciesism, and wrong for the same reasons that racism and sexism are wrong. Pain is equally bad, if it is felt by a human being or a mouse.

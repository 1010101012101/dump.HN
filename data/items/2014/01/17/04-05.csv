Just ignore them and say you are not interested until they are literally waving cash in front of you, begging to aquire you, or require that they follow specific steps to indicate real interest, such as a Contingent Offer with a due diligence deposit, breakup fee, and strict NDA?<p>How is this done with the lots of sub $10M acquisitions that happen? Clearly deals are being done here, so I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t pay to ignore bona fide offers, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of time wasters out there too.<p>What do you advise your YC portfolio companies to do here?

7074369,comment,7073198,7073561,2,0,dclusin,,,"The only three events that could send bitcoin to $0 are, in my opinion, if people stop using it and decide that it&#x27;s worthless, the encryption scheme or peer to peer network are some how compromised, or all nations simultaneously outlaw it. However the last one would only serve to send it near zero.<p>Consider if all governments outlaw it simultaneously. The market participants currently consist of free market type enthusiasts & hobbyists, rich celebrity speculators, drug dealers and cyber criminals. I think it is a fair assumption that most of the active traders are currently from the hobbyist & enthusiast category. Additionally when you consider that places like Silicon Valley and other hubs around the world have a large proportion tech savvy workers who make a lot more than subsistence wages, it&#x27;s not too hard to see how some sort of speculative market could continue to lumber along without much reason for existence. Look at sports betting and horse racing.<p>If the government were to come out and drop the hammer, however, I think most of these people (myself included) would vanish. The volume would dry up and the only people left in the market would be criminals and people with a hard requirement for virtually untraceable digital currency, prison be damned. My opinion is that these people would continue to remain using it as a means of commerce and store of value provided that the underlying cryptography & p2p network remain sound and un-compromised. There are currently millions of bitcoin in existence so a price of near zero would probably satisfy the black market. How does $3 sound as a reasonable number that readers can use against me in the probable event that I turn out to be wrong 5 years from now?<p>Of course this all relies on the underlying cryptography and  associated peer to peer network remaining sound and trustworthy. If a party is able to compromise the underlying encryption or execute a double spend by attacking the network then trust in bitcoin as a finite commodity would be irrevocably destroyed. No one would ever use it, thus a $0 price.<p>The utility of bitcoin is just too hard to ignore from a commerce perspective. It&#x27;s taking away authority and power from banks to act as gate keepers to their countries finical & economic system and putting it in the hands of the people who engage in commerce themselves. I don&#x27;t believe banks will cease to exist as some of bitcoin&#x27;s most ardent supports hope it will, but the transaction costs for international business could drop substantially. Barring bad news on the legislative or technology front the only thing stopping bitcoin from gaining greater adoption is that too many people are psychologically fixated on an individual bitcoin. Bitcoin is sub divisible up to 8 decimal places, the vast majority of people who have heard about bitcoin that I have talked to do not realize this. Since the total number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million this yields a total number of theoretical units of currency of 210 trillion. That&#x27;s a pretty formidable island on which to create a base of trade on.",1389934446

7074367,comment,7073843,7074291,5,0,kanamekun,,,"The Economist has a longstanding policy of leaving bylines off of articles:\n<a href""http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/economist-explains-itself-"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/ec...</a><p><< Part of the answer is that The Economist is maintaining a historical tradition that other publications have abandoned. ... Historically, many publications printed articles without bylines or under pseudonyms—a subject worthy of a forthcoming explainer of its own—to give individual writers the freedom to assume different voices and to enable early newspapers to give the impression that their editorial teams were larger than they really were. The first few issues of The Economist were, in fact, written almost entirely by James Wilson, the founding editor, though he wrote in the first-person plural.<p>But having started off as a way for one person to give the impression of being many, anonymity has since come to serve the opposite function at The Economist: it allows many writers to speak with a collective voice. Leaders are discussed and debated each week in meetings that are open to all members of the editorial staff. Journalists often co-operate on articles. And some articles are heavily edited. Accordingly, articles are often the work of The Economist&#x27;s hive mind, rather than of a single author. The main reason for anonymity, however, is a belief that what is written is more important than who writes it. >>",1389934332

I can sympathize with the students though, the university threatened to take disciplinary action (whether that means not allowing them to receive a piece of paper from them, or some kind of suspension, who knows) for their efforts in recognizing a problem and applying their knowledge for the betterment of their student body, and maybe with the university staff that had to come to the consensus to do what they did for whatever reasons (maybe ones listed in this thread, but we&#x27;ll probably never hear a straight answer from them either way).

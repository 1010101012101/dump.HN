46724,comment,46614,46618,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"I still think Peter Norvig's ""Artificial Intelligence"" book plus a good book on Data Mining (someone suggested Frank and Witten above) might deliver more value than this. <p>As Henning pointed out above , there aren't enough pages to cover even a few of the topics properly. It  <i></i>looks like<i></i> the coverage is  fairly thin and lacking in depth, and is more of a ""some basic AI algorithms for  the hot topic of the day"" type book.<p>I haven't seen the book yet but the table of contents makes me suspect the quality. ""Support Vector Machines"" for example are fairly complex beasts. The book has one section (from what I can see on the TOC) about SVMs.<p>Norvig's AIMA is a brilliant book precisely because it lays  a solid foundation for so much of AI. And it is still  a very hefty book.
I somehow doubt that this is of the same caliber.<p>But hey, I could be wrong.<p>
 Just a personal opinion and not to dampen anyone's enthusiasm. ",1188134652

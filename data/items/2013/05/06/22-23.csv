Being a top player will get you sponsorships and notoriety which can be leveraged into other projects like online shows, consulting jobs, etc. Sponsorships at minimum include travel expenses, but often will pay for full-time living expenses.<p>Twitch is a not-insignificant part of it, along with youtube etc. The companies that sponsor players use the hype to get eyeballs on their own sponsors' ads.<p>I am sorry to admit I don't have any sources for this information.

5665300,comment,5664998,5664998,1,0,bredren,,,"This is a noble idea and drives at questions on business ethics.<p>Most businesses don't approach subscriptions this way.  Some portion of revenue comes from people choosing a ""set it and forget it"" approach toward service subscriptions. Is it unearned revenue? The traditional take is the user has access to the premium product.  If they don't use it, that's their problem.  (i.e. a gym membership)<p>I think traditional MBA thinking is to optimize around revenue at any cost. However, I think this sort of behavior has made people, (especially young people), not trust businesses from banks to wireless carriers.  I think businesses that optimize around revenue rather a relationship with their users are likely to lose them as soon as there is an alternative.<p>Clearly, it is in the best interests of the user to do this though, as a business you should also expect to drive more long term loyalty to the product.<p>I think the entry could make an argument that this will cause users to be more loyal to you or create longer lasting subscriptions. Without data or even anecdotal feedback that users are more likely to stay because of this choice, it sounds like you are something of a White Knight turning away money.<p>From a user perspective, I'm used to a use it or lose it subscription.  So, if I am not charged, and then I all of a sudden am charged because I came back, I might get confused. Do you do customer education at the time of the subscription creation of this friendly charging policy?  Do you notify the user by email when they are not being charged because of a lack of activity?  (This might be a good way to actually get them back to the product, and possibly you have measurable data to support the value of this?)",1367880917

If you were on version 7 and the new version is version 13, a message is conveyed that there have been several major iterations since your last upgrade. Numerical versioning schemes (in general) make it simple to know if you're on a current version, and if not, how far off you are.<p>Now consider trying to make similar determinations if you know you're running ""Gingerbread"" but the latest version is ""Jelly Bean"", or if you're on ""Intrepid Ibex"" and the latest version is ""Raring Ringtail"".<p>It's even worse on Ubuntu, where they've chosen a reasonable, useful numerical versioning system (year.month), but then obscure it with stupid codenames.<p>IMO it's also much more difficult to remember the codenames. I had to verify that Android 4.2 was still called Jelly Bean and though I knew the latest Ubuntu was 13.04, I had to look up its codename altogether.<p>The fact that these projects continue to have underlying ""developer use only""-type numerical versions only further emphasizes the utility of these. The codenames feel like a poorly-conceived marketing thing. I don't think most people have trouble remembering a coupled software package with a version number, like ""Windows 7"". I don't think they often say, ""Oh crap, I know I had version 4 of something ... was it Android or Windows?""",1367880675

Can you name a few more?<p>School is basic, as health services, you can also add libraries, and TV.<p>In Spain an abused child goes to an hospital sooner or later, and some injuries are very dificult to hide or fake to a professional. A physician can take a discrete look under the shirt of a child and he/she knows what to search for. Later they can send a silent alert to the appropriate channels if this is suspicious or simply call the police if there is some gross evidence.<p>If you want to tell a telephone number to the children, simply assure that this number is a the school, in a poster at the hall. Pretty simple, safe and cheap also.<p>If you want to be really twisted, put this number in some selected books in the school's library with an inked rubber stamp.<p>Ask the teachers to spoke about it in a delicate and sensitive way. They can provide a better, more focused and controlled message in a safe environment. A poster in a solitary street with this aggressor can' have the same benefits and could even put him/her at risk. The adult could even beat him, menace or manipulate him distorting the message in unpredictable ways<p>If you want to reach a target not in education you could use the TV channels for childrens. When we are trying to sell a toy, a film or a burguer to a child there is not a safe place where the parents can hide.

Many people do work in groups, and many people do work closely with their advisor. But, in the end, the student is expected to <i>own</i> some research themselves.

Element stacking would be handled by the browser's built-in compositor. You wouldn't have to think about crazy microoptimizations like grouping fillStyles together. SVG can easily be accelerated by the browser, since you're describing intent instead of specific procedures, unlike Canvas' immediate mode drawing.

5665186,comment,5663157,5663157,1,0,forrestpitz,,,"I feel like the sentiment of ""I can't do math"" stems mostly from the way math is taught. To contrast we can look at how reading is taught to elementary students. Students read books at their ""level."" Once they are comfortable with the words and concepts in a given level then the difficulty of the content is scaled up appropriately. In math, students are often pulled along with the rest of the class. It is very difficult to understand division when you are still struggling to understand subtraction. This happens for a number of reasons but mostly because it is more difficult to teach math on an individual level the way reading can be though. I think that the solution to issues like this will/would look similar to the reverse model that the folks at KahnAcademy are creating. It's clear that it is difficult to teach math of every student is at a different point and understands a different amount of math. By transferring the teaching onto prerecorded videos the students are able to learn at their own pace and rewatch the lessons for more difficult concepts without exasperating the teacher. Salman Kahn has stated that his cousin (that he first started making videos for) told him that she liked learning from him in his videos more because he wouldn't get frustrated when she didn't understand a concept. She could just watch it again. This also frees the teacher to help the students who are learning at a slower rate or have gotten stuck with a difficult concept.",1367879284

If you didn't ever open last month's issue when it's time to send the new one, that's it, they don't send it and don't charge you again.<p>Even with the magic tracker, that's probably no good because you might want to collect them. Not likely but they probably shouldn't presume you don't want what you explicitly paid for since it has possible value whether or not you open it. I know one startup (<a href=""http://serps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serps.com</a>) with a similarly watertight excuse not to auto-cancel subscriptions: SERPs constantly fetches and compiles data for you. You can take a multi-month hiatus and still be accumulating value that you'll use whenever you come back.

The goal for claims in a wikipedia article is that they be <i>verifiable</i>, not that they be <i>true</i>. The definition of a ""verifiable"" claim is that somebody made that claim in a ""reliable source"".

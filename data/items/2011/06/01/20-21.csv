2609307,comment,2607645,2609005,6,0,arohner,,,"It's somewhat arbitrary which precious metal we use, but it's not entirely arbitrary.<p>There's the usual reasons we use e.g. gold for money. It's fungible, ductile, rare and essentially impossible to forge. That rules out cigarettes and Yap rai as <i>stable</i> currencies.<p>As far as gold vs. silver vs. platinum, the inflation rate (i.e. the rate at which new metal comes out of the ground) is also important. Gold inflates slower than silver, simply because there's more silver in the ground.<p>As far as gold vs. platinum, it's important to look at what happens if the world decided to move to gold or platinum as a currency. Gold is already used as a store of value, while platinum isn't. If everyone moved to gold as currency, it would become far more valued. If the same happened to platinum, its value would go stratospheric. There are essentially no platinum reserves (compared to gold), so its price would be even more volatile, and its price would spike far more than gold.<p>Platinum is also much more concentrated, geographically. There are like 5 working platinum mines in the world, and like 4 of them are in South Africa. South Africa has more of the world's platinum than the middle east has of the world's oil supply.<p>Those objections are not insurmountable, but human civilizations have been using gold & silver as currency for thousands of years,  but the same is not true of platinum. Don't underestimate inertia.",1306961831

2609304,comment,2605739,2609088,2,0,ktsmith,,,"> you're talking about about making a cleaner legal audit trail.<p>Not exactly, the legal audit trail can be messy and it doesn't matter one bit so long as it's accurate. In the case described change one is logged and the undo constitues a second change which is also logged. Change one incurs liability for the user and change two simply increases the liability for the user (sorry I can't go into specifics) even though it's correcting a problem. In my experience it's very difficult to create a user interface where the ""undo"" action clearly indicates the consequence of the change in these scenarios. Preventing unnecessary changes via a combination of up front documentation and confirmation provided the better user experience, and legal liability reduction, in my experience and based on some user feedback.<p>> But a worse interface that makes the software easier to code is one thing; a worse interface that makes the software more easily comply with the law is an entirely different trade-off.<p>Believe me, not confirming user actions would have been less code and easier to build and maintain in this case. Legal compliance on my part would have been maintained in either case. Allowing my users to quickly and easily build up liability would be doing them a disservice however. Adding some friction to those transactions was agreed to be the better option by everyone involved.<p>I think the idea that confirmation vs undo is subjective. We can go on and on for hours and come up with examples and counter examples. The particular context of the action likely determines which provides the better user experience in total (not just on that one screen or interaction but via the consequences of the action as well). I would certainly prefer that if I'm using a system like facebook that it confirm I really want to make my home address and phone number public before it does so rather than letting me check a box and it's done. The same goes with a money transfer where an undo may not even be possible after some amount of time. Not prompting for confirmation certainly makes the transactions move faster (less friction) and undo is easy enough in many cases, but does that frictionless transaction have the best outcome for my users? Not always. The blanket statement that ""undo > confirmation. Always."" is just plain wrong, not that you made it of course.",1306961807

You can't ignore other parts of the process and then, only at the very end, say that the quality of work is the only thing that matters. Sure, if boys and girls at home and in our education system were treated equally, encouraged to pursue the same things, given the same opportunities...then yes, you could make this argument.<p>The problem, though, is that this isn't the case. Women in the United States aren't shying away from STEM disciplines because they're generally intellectually incapable of it; it's because they encounter strong societal pressures against doing so. Other countries--I'm thinking of Romania in particular, which sent a large number of IMO medalists to my university during my years there--have many more women in math and science. (And no, they're not bad at what they do.) Unless you're going to try to claim that Romanian women are somehow different or more talented than American women, it seems clear that the ways that our society and educators are affecting them are responsible for this disparity.<p>And once you take that into consideration, the argument for improving this problem starts to become a lot more reasonable. It bears a lot of similarity to that line from Lyndon Johnson: "" You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'you are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair."" \nIt's pretty similar here. Jean (and others dedicated to this cause) aren't interested in ""skewing"" the game unfairly. Instead, they contend that because of issues earlier in the process, whatever they may be, the gender gap isn't and shouldn't be the natural order of things.",1306960565

The patent holder must determine how much investment was made to develop the specific patent [1], and this number should be the upper bound on how much the patent holder can sue for [2].<p>This would effectively cover the pharmaceutical case where hundreds of millions are invested, as well as the worst software case where only a few thousand are invested.<p>[1] - This number would need to pass simple smell tests: the sum of these investment amounts across a patent portfolio can't exceed the total expenses in the company's books for R&D, etc.\n[2] - If a patent holder sues multiple companies at once, each infringing company would owe only a fraction of the total.",1306960002

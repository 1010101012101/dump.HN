Requiring some thought when posing a query isn't necessarily a bad thing.<p>Wolfram Alpha also has a nice feedback form on the front page.  Not that I'm holding my breath, but what the author of the article should do is put all his rants into that feedback form, wait a month, and then comment on any changes made.  That type of followup article would be more interesting to me.",1242730712

Anyone should be able to comment/discuss articles. With perhaps karma based user voting to surface the best comments. Each comment should again be citable.<p>2. The text should be in HTML- shareable simply and acted upon by the community.<p>3. A reddit style list for each topic listing the recent,high impact papers. High impact is again voted on by the community, again with people who are 'known' to produce better research having more weight.",1242730597

Historically, all kinds of rules have been tossed about to guide administrators on how much swap to configure on their machines. The problem, of course, is there are few ""normal"" application.<p>One non-obvious use for swap is to be a place the kernel can dump a copy of what is in core in the event of a system panic for later analysis. For this to work, you must have a swap partition (not a swap file) at least as large as your RAM. By default, the system will save a copy of this dump to /var/crash on reboot, so if you wish to be able to do this automatically, you will need sufficient free space on /var. However, you can also bring the system up single-user, and use savecore(8) to dump it elsewhere.<p>Many types of systems may be appropriately configured with no swap at all. For example, firewalls should not swap in normal operation. Machines with flash storage generally should not swap. If your firewall is flash based, you may benefit (slightly) by not allocating a swap partition, though in most other cases, a swap partition won't actually hurt anything; most disks have more than enough space to allocate a little to swap.<p>There are all kinds of tips about optimizing swap (where on the disk, separate disks, etc.), but if you find yourself in a situation where optimizing swap is an issue, you probably need more RAM. In general, the best optimization for swap is to not need it.<p>In OpenBSD, swap is managed with the swapctl(8) program, which adds, removes, lists and prioritizes swap devices and files.",1242730479

616537,comment,614323,615759,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"That's a very harsh review of the hacker's diet.<p>More accurate would be food = energy, exercise = energy expenditure, obesity = prolonged energy surplus stored as fat, and weight loss = prolonged calorie deficit leading to fat reduction.<p>While I agree that there are wrinkles due to when, how and what you eat, I can't see a problem with that basic maths. You could say a 'bad' calories is one that triggers you to eat more calories, whether that's through habit, or addiction, or stomach stretching, or sugar rushes and crashes leading to hunger. But that still reduces down to more calories.<p>This book seems to be suggesting that the energy you store as fat comes from somewhere other than the food you eat. That's entering creationism or perpetual motion machine territory for me, and as you would then expect is accompanied by claims that the whole field is crooked.<p>The rebuttal linked from the article (by one of the ""villains"" of the book) suggests that the weird data comes down to people lying about what they eat to researchers. Not only do they not record everything they eat, they lie even more about their consumption of fatty foods which (correctly or not) the average person thinks are bad.<p>This makes it seem like people are gaining weight mysteriously, and that carbs are over-represented. Given the choice between overweight people misrepresenting what they eat and a whole branch of science being corrupt I'll take the former. Particularly if the book writer is happy to cherry pick out the results that he likes and ignore the rest of the field.",1242729298

After a comparison, they may decide they are the same, or one is better/worse.<p>The biggest problem for WA is that it is different enough that people used to the Google way of searching will not see its potential and powerful use cases.<p>The difference is this: In Google, most queries end up with a list of links to pages that Google thinks answer the query. In WA, you get the answer. Of course Google has the ""calculator"" functionality, and that's the directly analogous product to WA. That's a Google killer feature: I query and get an answer directly without clicking around and hopefully, maybe, potentially finding an answer. Whether that's good or bad is a separate subject.<p>Another more subtle difference: the query is interpreted differently by the search engines. WA's interpreter is much more powerful in deciding how to interpret the query; it also tells you how it interpreted your query. Google's queries are mostly keywords and phrases (and they've noted that the average number of words in queries is increasing), and fundamentally they're still interpreted as keywords as phrases not the meanings behind them.<p>How queries are written (keywords vs natural language) and how they are interpreted is a big area of innovation in the search industry. I don't think they've finally solved it, but they're certainly trying hard: Hakia, Powerset, True Knowledge, and now Wolfram Alpha.",1242727531

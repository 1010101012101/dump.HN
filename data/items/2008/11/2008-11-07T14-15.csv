In my county you need 75 hours of community service (fluffed 'Social Service Learning Hours') to graduate high school. I'm not whining, because you have 7 years to do it, but I'm just saying: ""This is America"" won't get you that far.",1226069465
356696,comment,356451,356488,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"> I was surprised that we had text-to-speech way back then. I'd always assumed that came much later.<p>It's not surprising that that you were surprised.  The ""Macintalk"" software that was part of that demo was a crude one shot that didn't get maintained regularly.  IIRC, the speech synthesis was neglected by the time of System 4.1 and didn't get engineering resources again until about Mac OS 8 or so.  (I started owning Macs during this time period and was disappointed that my first Mac couldn't do speech for almost 5 years until Apple got their act together again.)  Macro/scripting support also had an abortive start, with System 6 using a ""MacroMaker"" system that was shelved for 7, only to be partially replaced by AppleScript.  (With UI scripting only being reintroduced with OS X!)  And don't get me started on how Apple abandoned Balloon Help and Apple Guide for the inferior systems used on currrent Macs...  /-:",1226069419

A friend of mine got stuck in India after a vacation (passport troubles) for nearly 2 weeks, and had a rather difficult time afterwards.<p>However, I'm one of the lucky few here. :) I'll manage to get the community service hours by being a sysop for my school, i.e. managing the Ubuntu server that runs a significant part of the school technology infrastructure.",1226069255

They do this by coming around to their offices, one-on-one, pulling them out to the corridor, and pressuring them to sign a card which they say is ""to get more information"" or something. Many people (and remember, an awful lot of postdocs can barely speak English) just sign the card to get them to go away, without realizing that they've just officially voted for unionization.",1226068715

  * Build things. Apply what you've learnt and constantly build things. Either at work or as personal projects. Don't worry if the things you built are crap or pointless or un-monetizable.
  * Share. Constantly share what you've learnt and built. Help others. Join the community and participate. You could be the best developer ever but it won't matter if nobody knows about you and your work.</code></pre>",1226066716

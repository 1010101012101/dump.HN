I&#x27;m not sure why Occupy were not informed of such a plot though? Perhaps the FBI didn&#x27;t think it was credible?<p>The part that worries me even more than the death threats was the classification of the Occupy movement as &#x27;terrorist activity&#x27;. This opens them up to a whole catalogue of surveillance methods and methods of detention, and is a good illustration of terrorism powers being extended and misused for domestic dissent.<p>This misuse of the label &#x27;terrorist&#x27; highlights the danger of employing extra-legal means to attack your enemies in other countries, it undermines the rule of law everywhere, and weakens the accountability of all law enforcement agencies. Assassination, torture, rendition, and detention without trial are all normalised now in the US for terrorists.

The overt act does not have to be related to the target offense of the conspiracy, just in furtherance.

Basically it says that if you&#x27;re an EU citizen and you paid a one-time fee for a lifetime license of software, you can resell it. I created a site that will let you sell your used Steam games www.halfpricedigital.com Twitter @HalfPriceDigi<p>If you&#x27;re in the EU and you want to protest Steam&#x27;s no-resale policy, just list your Steam game for sale and then email Valve to ask them how you will be able to transfer the game when your auction ends. Here&#x27;s Valve&#x27;s email form http://www.valvesoftware.com/email.php I&#x27;m turning off the fees on my site for a month starting today - so, no, I&#x27;m not scamming you for a percentage of the sale.<p>Valve will probably tell you reselling games is against their user agreement. Tell them that that&#x27;s against EU law and mention the UsedSoft v Oracle ruling.  If we can get Valve to allow reselling games in the EU, they might allow reselling games all over the world.<p>UsedSoft v Oracle info: http://www.forbes.com/sites/raywang/2012/07/04/news-analysis-usedsoft-vs-oracle-ruling-opens-up-monopolistic-practices-by-software-vendors/<p>TL;DR - Protest Steam&#x27;s illegal no resale policy by listing your used Steam games for sale on www.halfpricedigital.com if you&#x27;re an EU citizen.",1372917920

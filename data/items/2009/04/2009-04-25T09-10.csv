578802,comment,578602,578602,0,0,silencio,,,"I wish I could follow in Randall Munroe's footsteps and get a Kindle and bend some wires to read in bed easily...but the Kindle has no backlight. I hate leaving the lights on while reading, cause usually I just fall asleep in the middle of reading. So it's a huge dealbreaker for me. (I have a lightwedge I could use, since I used to read paper books in bed, but new gadgets I spend a few hundred $ on not having any sort of lighting is a downer. Plus that's extra to hold in bed.)<p>I like to use my iPhone for reading, with bookshelf or stanza usually (kindle app is meh). I have a place to put my phone near my bed, plus if I fall asleep with it it's not large enough that it would be uncomfortable to roll around on top of while sleeping. Plus, I can always find it in the morning by calling it ;)<p>Unfortunately, I do have to mention that my reading ebooks in bed on this past Tuesday night somewhat ruined the next day, as I slept for a couple hours, woke up being unable to go back to sleep, and then spent the next twelve hours reading ebook after ebook on my iPhone. It's really nice to be able to grab books whenever I want without even getting up like I would with paper, but there is always that downside :(<p>What was it about reading on your iPod touch that didn't work out? Pretty much any ebook reader worth using for the iPhone/iPod touch has something similar to rotation lock and tap to scroll, which I would imagine would be the biggest problem with being on your side.",1240652912

  will occur when a sufficient number of them share
  an operating system ... 

  Viruses spread by Bluetooth could reach all users
  of a given OS in days, whereas those spread by
  multimedia messages could spread in just hours. 

  But the virulence will only appear when a given
  OS has about 10% market share. 
</code></pre>
Monocultures are always a bad idea, but users seem to insist on ubiquity of interface.  Perhaps there's an opportunity here to use a radically different OS, but provide effectively the same user interface.<p>Ah, no, the law regulates ""Look'n'Feel"" so the legal system coupled with quite reasonable user expectations ensure that we end with a technology susceptable to viruses and other attacks.<p>Interesting dilemma.  I'm sure my ""analysis"" (written as a stream of consciousness, hence not to be taken seriously) is deeply flawed.",1240652429

The changes voted for are those that ""return"" control of content to users.  The changes originally imposed by Facbook took that control away from them.  Either the BBC is being breathtakingly ignorant of what the fuss was about, or deliberately misleading in its construction of its headline.<p>Either way, allegedly the voting is being audited externally.

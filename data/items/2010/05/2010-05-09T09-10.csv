Way to go if they're locked out of all the possible online sources of information that might tell them what's going on!<p>(And I really don't think Apple will be wanting to jump through the medical device certification hoops for OSX and the iPhone, given what the regulatory regime is like ...)",1273397799

At my last company I fired about a third of the engineers I hired after 3 to 6 months and ended up with a great technical team. I never know how good an engineer is going to be during the interview process but after 6 months it is blindingly clear.<p>I am upfront about the winnowing process during the interview, it scares some candidates away but I often get a very positive reaction to this ""meritocracy by proof"" approach. Another advantage is you can take  some flyers on people with nontraditional backgrounds and find the occasionally diamond in the rough.",1273396678

1331766,comment,1331307,1331511,0,0,vecter,,,"I don't think you understand that people who make markets (add liquidity) decrease YOUR investment costs. These market makers can only trade millions of shares per second (a vast overstatement) IF there is actual demand for that. Suppose there is such demand. Then, the market makers are providing a valuable service by supplying liquidity for people who want to buy or sell.<p>A sales tax would vastly increase costs for everyone involved. Your parents pension fund would generate lesser returns because it costs them more to enter and exit positions. Your ""back to basics"" quip is bullshit. What does ""going back to basics"" even mean? People trade because they think they can make a profit or hedge their risk. That's all there is to it, nothing ""more basic"".",1273396301
1331765,comment,1331025,1331025,0,0,Amnon,,,"Summary of the article: AV software hook into Windows system calls. When user-mode calls a kernel function, the AV hook handler first checks that the arguments comply with the security policy. If they do, it passes the arguments to Windows in order to execute the call. However, another user-mode thread can change the data between the time of the check and the execution. The AV will see valid data, but Windows itself will act upon the malicious data.<p>This is a vulnerability in AV software, not in Windows. If the attack succeeds the system remains just as secure as other operating systems which don't have AV.<p>How can the attack be prevented? I guess in the same way that the kernel itself prevents such attacks (after all, the kernel has its own checks, which presumably can't be bypassed). There's probably a way to make memory pages read-only for the duration of the system call, so the data can't be changed.",1273396177

old physical way?<p>Guess this would be a demonstration of just how seriously we depend on the net in daily life. Would banking be affected - do banks use entirely separate comms lines? Emergency services? Power networks - how is energy usage monitored in nation-wide grids? And what sort of fail-over systems exist?",1273396173

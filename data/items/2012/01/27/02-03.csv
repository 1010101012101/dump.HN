Surely there is a more efficient way to make that same journey that won't involve an ""over engineered"" car with a massive possible range.  Certainly you don't need four passenger seats when traveling to the dry cleaners.  Thus, you could probably get by with a smaller vehicle or a smart form of public transportation to accomplish the same task (and reduce the amount of space used for parking lots).<p>I think I am putting more thought into this comment than Isaac Sukin put into understanding the original piece.",1327633021

My guess, if it were polled, would be no more than 20% support for these kinds of collusion agreements being legitimate; certainly not a majority in support. Americans generally don't consider the unrestrained ""truly free market"", full of blackballing, price-fixing, insider trading, monopoly leverage, retaliation, dumping, racial covenants, and all the rest of the late-19th-century fine business practices, to be a legitimate part of the American form of capitalism.<p>Even in the libertarian-leaning tech community, you'd be hard-pressed to rustle up majority support for Microsoft's 1990s-era OEM strongarming, where they retaliated against suppliers who shipped competing operating systems like Linux--- which would be perfectly fine behavior in an unrestrained free market.",1327632481

In some classes there are a core set of ideas that are extremely important to understand and a much larger set of application concepts.  Because tests require memorization it is much easier to focus only on the core ideas whereas homework or projects that did this would be frowned upon for being ""too easy.""<p>I've had this especially happen with finals, like my Differential Equations final where I managed to get all the concepts of the entire semester onto a single page when studying. I had a lightbulb moment where I realized the important parts of the class were really simple, it's just all the twists and challenges about application made it seem more complicated.<p>Similarly I got mad at a grad teacher recently when he would not make our last lecture a review because according to him we shouldn't need ""hand-holding.""  It ticked me off because a day to summarize what we've learned over several months seems like a smart idea to me.  I guess I feel like tests can be similar, a way to filter out things that are taught that are good to learn, but not as important as other things.  Kind of like when a teacher says, ""If you leave this class and only remember a single thing I want it to be this.""<p>On the other hand I see tests not working for some people.  I have a close friend who has memory problems.  She is so frustrated by college because due to her memory her application of the classes is completely different to how she is tested.",1327630579

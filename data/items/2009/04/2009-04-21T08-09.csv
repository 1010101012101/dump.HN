So for example build a web app with access to the company's legacy accounts database or something. No abstractions over schema free DB's.",1240304011
572091,comment,568366,569303,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"There's two parts to Atom, Atom itself which is like a better RSS and AtomPub. He's talking about the latter.<p>From Wikipedia: ""The Atom Syndication Format is an XML language used for web feeds, while the Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub or APP) is a simple HTTP-based protocol for creating and updating web resources.""<p>Atom itself is doing fine. Readers have to cater to RSS for historical reasons but for most producers, particularly in non-standard (not ""blogging"") contexts, it's a waste of time.",1240303993

So far all we have is lots of hype and a video or two.<p>I personally believe the whole ""multitide of dsls""  angle, which is where Mr.Fowler is  coming from, is a load of fluff wrapped around a genuine engineering principle (linguistic abstraction - see SICP). The fluff is the ""enterprisey"" part.",1240303946

572087,comment,571686,571686,0,0,jgfoot,,,"Instead of learning how to manage his time and show some discipline in committing to a reasonable schedule, this kid took neuroenhancers to help compensate for ""partying all weekend, or spen[ding] the last week being high.""  Just as the kid who reads Cliffs Notes instead of The Iliad deprives himself of an intellectual experience, this guy deprived himself of the opportunity to train himself to develop natural work habits that he will need as he embarks on a career.",1240303701

Until they show us how they handle those details, they don't really have anything to say.",1240303088

572080,comment,571326,571326,0,0,Zak,,,"It is probably a mistake to treat language design as computer science, just as it is a mistake to treat motorcycle design as physics. Languages are tools for people to use; a language is good if people love it (it is a given that some people will hate it, and likely that more people will hate it than love it).",1240302800

572077,comment,571908,572052,0,0,gtufano,,,"I find interesting that you assume that disparity within nations is caused by differences in intelligence. While this is true (i.e.: differences in intelligence make a difference, sorry for the joke) there are many, many, other causes for differences: geographics (easy), social (not all the countries are permeable to social status changes) and so on... I feel this ""all is caused by the intelligence"" a bit ingenuous. But may be it is only my european culture speaking...",1240302599

2) if you must do hardware yourself, can you have anyway of scoping product, doing google adwords, anything to assess demand and product fit?<p>The hardware business is BRUTAL. It is going to be exceedingly tough to get financing for your project, given high capital requirements and low profit margins.",1240302189
572070,comment,571970,571970,0,0,alexbeaudet,,,"Even though Kevin Rose was pretty tight-lipped with respect to product, I think it will be interesting to see Digg move in a different direction later this year, with him hinting at an emphasis on real-time search. Whether or not this is the future though, despite everyone swooning over Twitter, remains to be seen. It makes me wonder whether the supposed importance of real-time search will be a self-fulfilling prophecy (with these large companies jumping on the bandwagon, and pushing it to mainstream importance) or if it will reach that state in its own right.<p>On another note, I don't think Arrington's reference to Hacker News as a competitor to Digg is particularly accurate, as they clearly have separate goals. HN is trying to maintain what Digg wasn't able to - namely a civil, intelligent community. Oddly enough, he preceded that topic by first commenting that Digg has done a good job with trolling, and asking how they'll combat it as they continue to grow. Seriously? Has he checked out the comments on Digg lately?",1240301901

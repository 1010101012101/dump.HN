I think it simply <i>is</i> the smartphone market. People like Marco don't want this to be true, because they think Apple has already lost this market. That's why there's so much effort expended trying to desperately to separate the two. It's like the old business school cliche of ""what business are you in?"". The trains thought they were in the train business, but really they were in the people moving business and got disrupted by aircraft. Tablets and smartphones are just two ways of accessing the web (in its widest sense).

Say I had actually passed the Japanese to English translation test (which I didn't -- what can I say, must have been having a bad night, and I think I botched the heck out of a statement on the red tide's effect on productivity of fish stocks).  I would log into myGengo, and there would be a list of J -> E translations awaiting completion, with titles.  I could get the full text for one, get basically an editing lock on it (i.e. no one else is translating it while I am), and then after completion the customer reviews, accepts, and I get paid money.<p>This is optionally doable via API on the customer's side, which is a practical necessity for someone whose business was doing that transaction several hundreds or thousands of times per day.

For me, it highlights the bigger question: _why_ do we have this propensity to ""trust without doubt""?<p>My pet theory for that is based on risk-avoidance and (behavioural) rational choice theory. When we try to figure out the world in order to effectively interact with it, uncertainty is a huge problem. It is primarily a cognitive processing problem: if you don't know what it going on and what you should or can do about it, you are cognitively stuck and cannot take action. This increases our perception of risk, and possibly real risk too due to our cognitive machinery being engaged and confused.<p>Unconditional belief to the rescue! If there is something that we can trust without doubt, whatever the rationale behind it might be, it sounds appealing - even if the belief is mistaken, it frees up the cognitive machinery. The more abstract or unfalsifiable a belief, the easier it is to completely trust it and believe in it.<p><troll>Cue religion, UFOs, nationalism, horoscopes, communism, homeopathy, libertarianism, rational choice theory, karma.</troll>",1308649522

It seems the majority of attempts at making an ipad theme take from the experience I have on my ipad rather than add to it. However, there are certain things that a site needs to do (differently) to function on an iOS device or indeed any touch-screen device. Primary among these is to remove any notion of or dependency on a hover-state from the UI since this is meaningless on a touch device. Many sites are unusable because of this. There are other minor niggles also such as styling 'pressed' button elements (which never return to their unpressed state)<p>If iOS 'themes' for sites focused on simple usability issues like that instead of trying to do the whole custom iOS 'experience' they would be far more usable.",1308648559

2678006,comment,2677397,2677747,5,0,redthrowaway,,,"Rational Choice Theory is the claim that the economic behaviour of groups can be best modelled by assuming each individual is operating in their own rational self-interest.  It is where game theory originates, and is more or less adept at explaining the fluctuations of markets.<p>Rational Choice Philosophy goes beyond this to offer a prescription for how one ought to live one's life.  It emphasizes the <i>moral supremacy of rational pursuit of individual goals</i>.  Beyond merely describing how groups behave, it argues that it is <i>good</i> that they act in the manner described.  It holds that the best outcomes are those generated by each individual pursuing their goals rationally.  It forms part of the moral foundation of libertarianism, and is the genesis of such notions as the supremacy of private charity over public services.  From the RCP perspective, it is morally preferable for individuals to make a rational choice to donate their time or resources to further a desired goal, than for a government (or collective) to impose those choices upon all people.<p>As the author states, a rational extension of this moral imperative is that individuals should seek to maximize their own power, so as to be better able to achieve their goals.  This is the moral backdrop that has framed the common narrative in America, certainly since the Reagan years if not earlier.  While it may seem a natural thing to believe, it is only so because of its pervasiveness in the culture that shapes our moral judgements.  By contrast, in China a person who advocated RCP would be considered greedy or selfish.  There, community, family, and cohesion are more highly valued.  This too is a product of their shared narrative.<p>The author's mention of quantum mechanics is sloppy.  In the Great Free Will Debate, a Newtonian determinism had seemed to spell the end of free will.  If our choices are the product of electrochemical processes in our brains, which are determined by our genetics and environment, which all essentially come down to atoms smashing into eachother, then everything that will ever happen was determined at the Big Bang and so free will is an illusion. It may be a <i>convenient</i> illusion that has been evolutionarily beneficial, but it's an illusion nonetheless.  Then, quantum mechanics came along and poked holes in determinism.  Some atomic processes may not be predetermined, and are instead functions of probability.  This didn't save free will, as random chance is still beyond the control of the agent, but it did call determinism into question.<p>What I suspect the author is getting at is that he (implictly) argues that the ability to make a rational choice depends upon the ability to know the effects of a given cause, which may not be possible if quantum processes introduce randomness.  There's a couple problems with this: 1) nobody has ever shown quantum effects at a macro scale (Herr Schrodinger's cat notwithstanding), and more importantly 2) the ability to make a rational decision does not depend upon a perfect model of cause and effect.  Reason need not be deductive; it is enough to make an educated guess about the state of the world and the effects of one's actions effect upon it.<p>The author didn't prove his central thesis, that RCP has failed.  That would entail a far deeper inspection of the philosophy than was done.  He did, however, make some interesting observations about it, namely that our common belief that it is good for us to act according to our desires was deliberately fostered as a counterpoint to Marxism.  That's not a condemnation of the philosophy itself, however.<p>As for Ayn Rand, the author may simply have been saying that her ideas gained far greater prominence after the deliberate campaign to foster a moral philosophy of rationally pursuing one's individual desires.",1308648010

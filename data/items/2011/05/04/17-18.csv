2514643,comment,2513123,2514526,2,0,dkarl,,,"The perception of ""cramming"" is Linus's problem.  The concrete complaint he makes (before his blanket statement that ethics should never be discussed publicly) is that people ""push"" the GPL as being ""about 'ethics.'""  Well, that is nothing about Linus, it is about the GPL, so he can't even claim it's personal.  Plus, it's a reasonable opinion to have, especially since the person wrote the GPL did so to promote certain ethical considerations.  It is Linus's fault that he is so sensitive that he can't abide somebody having an opinion that the GPL has an ethical side to it.<p>Then he goes on to say, ""I really want to point out that it's not that the license is somehow ethical per se.""  So it's okay for <i>him</i> to have and express an opinion on that question.  The hypocrisy is really thick there.<p>And here's the question that prompted that response:  ""Do you agree that there is an ethical content in the GPL?""  Hardly a pushy question, and the interviewer practically apologizes before he asks the question.  So no, there is no cramming, there is just a person who is extremely sensitive on an issue and responds to a polite question with an insulting rant about civility.  There is nothing cool about that.  He isn't dropping his brilliant technical judgment on an unsuspecting noob who will be better for it in the long run.  It's just unpleasant behavior to no useful end.",1304531832

An ARM Cortex (or GPU, or whatever) on this process would see similar gains.<p>It's also worth pointing out that current Atoms in the market are still 45nm parts, not even 32nm.  Intel, for obvious reasons, tends to prioritize production of high-margin desktop and server CPUs over low-margin embedded parts.<p>Really, this announcement isn't about ARM-based vs. Intel-based SoC designs.  I think it's clear that Intel has some catching up to do there.  This is about Intel cementing and extending its <i>complete and total dominance</i> of high end digital logic fabrication.  At this point they look to be about a full two years ahead of everyone else.  AMD, IBM, Samsung, TI, TSMC and the rest of that crew have to be more than a little worried.<p>Objectivity disclaimer: my wife is at Intel working on precisely this 22nm process.

It could be monitored or logged.  You could be vulnerable to MITM attacks or DNS poisoning.  SSL is not guaranteed to get you any real protection in this situation.<p>3.

Now you are uploading large encrypted files to 'innocently used domains' (whatever that means) from an internet cafe.

Once the Hudson team started acting somewhat autonomously, Oracle tried to frighten them out of doing anything without Oracle's say by invoking trademark litigation.<p>3. Rather than have a protracted battle, the Hudson team did actually begin talking to Oracle about taking the project to a foundation, such as Eclipse or Apache, to ensure legitimacy of process from both sides. Those talks broke down. I don't know any particulars, but I can believe that Eclipse was rejected and Apache favored. If Oracle was truly agnostic about it, Apache should have been fine. This makes me worried that there may have been (and still be) backroom deals going on to ensure Oracle gets preferential treatment. Your guess about keeping control of the Hudson trademark might well be something that got passed around.<p>4. Oracle absolutely did not plan for the Hudson team walking away from the name, and were arrogant enough to believe that when they did, the Hudson brand would live on and Jenkins would fade away.<p>5. Once is was clear that the heart of an open-source project is its developers, not its silent users (big surprise, right?), Oracle have tried to backpedal and have run into the arms of Eclipse to try and bring developers back.<p>It won't work, and like another commenter said, if Eclipse does take them up on it, it will just look bad on Eclipse. Sadly, the Hudson name is completely tainted at this point. And its not correct to say ""Well, that's OK, because users don't really care about all this stuff"" because the users <i>are</i> developers, and they <i>do</i> care about this stuff. The rabble-rousers on the sidelines, like Sonatype, also look like jerks, but at least Maven is under Apache Foundation control, so while I can hate Sonatype, I can still use their product without too much fear.",1304529983

If you are dealing with complicated write semantics that are likely to raise exceptions, AtomicMap may not be the right choice for you.  In our application, we have a lot of threads writing at once.  Exceptions in that path would indicate a pretty significant problem, far worse than how to handle them gracefully.<p>We have chosen to trade some flexibility in how the data structure can be used in exchange for an enormous increase in throughput.

Schools are generally very receptive to transfer students who they originally admitted in the first place, especially if you explain that the decision was financial.<p>Also, just a note - I'd advise you to be wary of the advice you get. Few people have attended both MIT and Poly are able to directly compare them. The opportunities you will find at both schools are simply different, not necessarily with one being better than the other.<p>MIT will certainly have more resources and opportunities than Poly. However, keep in mind that there will also be more smart, motivated people vying for those opportunities, and in reality there is a fixed number of opportunities you can realistically pursue anyway.<p>But Poly will allow you to stand out. In a place where few of your peers will even bother to speak to the professor after class, you can monopolize on the opportunities that are available. Plus you will always be seen as ""that guy that got into MIT,"" and your peers will view you as a leader, allowing you to take leadership positions and convince other people to join your projects with ease.<p>Also, don't underestimate the magnitude of the money you will save. 100K could be the totality of savings you will amass 4-5 years out, graduating from MIT.

Three out of four batteries died after a month.  (And by died, I mean they suddenly went from powering my laptop for 4 hours to causing it to shutdown suddenly after 45 minutes.)<p>My question is this: What does everyone else do when their laptop battery dies?  Do you buy a new OEM replacement, or do you have a goods source for cheaper reliable replacements? Does it make sense to pay for the extended battery warranty?<p>Also, I've seen this post on HN about repairing the batteries yourself, but the risk of explosion or fire isn't something I like to worry about:\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1403726",1304528930

7936770,comment,7933386,7933839,1,0,yaeger,,,">Of COURSE it is.<p>Yes, it is boring to watch. As outlined in contrast to other sports. Even a minute before a random goal happens, the audience has no idea it is about to happen. It is just a random back and forth across the field. With a lot of resets as he puts it. Compared with  Football where you slowly advance to the opponents side and the audience knows when a goal becomes a possibility.<p>People say soccer didn&#x27;t catch on in the US because you can&#x27;t easily put commercials in it. I disagree. You could neatly fit entire infomercials in there and when you cut back to the action, chances are very high that the score is still the same as when they left things.<p>Also the double standard of being cool with games ending in a tie like a riveting 0-0 and on the other hand, at certain occasions, having to have a shootout to determine a winner is more than weird. They could have saved themselves 90 minutes by going to the shootout right away.",1403600355

In Europe (or at least here in The Netherlands, not 100% sure about the other countries) we can&#x27;t use the Nest thermostat because our central heating boilers and thermostats use the OpenTherm protocol. (<a href=""http://www.opentherm.eu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opentherm.eu/</a>)<p>Also, most boilers in Europe are of the modulating kind (not a simple on/off switch, but a more graduate gas consumption. Side note: I really don&#x27;t get why they don&#x27;t have this in the US. It&#x27;s so much more efficient...).<p>So, we can&#x27;t use Nest. Apple and Quirky announced they&#x27;ll be working with Philips and Honeywell, two companies that do offer modulating, OpenTherm thermostats.

This is how microwave ovens works.<p>The video demonstration you linked to is identical to what I would expect if the RF source acted as a microwave oven heating up the liquid in the slide.

Over the weekend, Quirky announced its $79 Wink hub, partnering with Home Depot, Honeywell, GE, Rachio, and Philips.<p>The two announcements were obviously timed against each other. It&#x27;s hard to tell who is reacting to whom, but my bet is that Quirky is hurriedly reacting to a pending Google I/O announcement this week, and getting the word out by giving the NYT an exclusive [1]. It also looks like Nest has an actual, planned microsite vs Quirky, who only has mention of GE on their website (<a href=""https://www.quirky.com/ge"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quirky.com/ge</a>) and doesn&#x27;t have much of an official Wink page yet (<a href=""https://www.quirky.com/wink"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quirky.com/wink</a> is bare).<p>Add to that Apple&#x27;s Homekit, announced at WWDC, partnering with Osram Sylvania, Skybell, TI, Chamberlain, August, Honeywell, Haier, Schlage, Philips, Black and Decker, Netatmo, Withings, and others. More brands/logos, but it&#x27;s early.<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s at least a three-horse race and we&#x27;ll see it get worse before it gets better.

Quite soon after we pivoted from an interesting problem to &#x27;low-hanging fruit&#x27;, and the team dynamics began to change rapidly, in a way that prevented progress (suddenly there was a lot of ego).

I programmed it to run as close to 24/7 as I could, because that way it uses the lowest flame, which is the most efficient flame.<p>When I tried a setback thermostat when the boiler attempted to rewarm the house it shifted to a higher and therefor less efficient flame. So I gave up on that and let it run on low all the time. So there would be no peak usage by me.<p>As people shift to more efficient ways to heating I suspect that this will happen to everyone. Not just modulating boilers, but also multi-stage heating with a heat pump. By trying to rapidly heat the home you can&#x27;t use the heat pump.<p>It&#x27;s also true with an A/C - the faster you are trying to cool the larger temperature gradient you need, and therefor you lose efficiency.<p>If I&#x27;m wrong here I would be happy to be corrected, but the US Government seems to agree with me: <a href=""https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=archives.thermostats_spec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=archives.thermostats_...</a>",1403597758

However as a &#x27;shop hub&#x27; for great designed devices that play along, &quot;Works with Nest&quot; is great. Also I am sure &quot;Works with Nest&quot; is a great vehicle for corporate deals of Google, since it allows them to do co-promotions (such as Mercedes) as side-projects which are usually embedded in such agreements.",1403596952

The back-end is a simple sinatra service that just allows &quot;GET /comments&quot; and &quot;POST comments&quot;.  (<a href=""http://github.com/skx/e-comments/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/skx/e-comments/</a>)<p>Last week I wrote a webhook-consumer, again using Sinatra.  It receives a POST from github, parses the received JSON, and adds some details of the body into a queue for later processing.<p>Both services allow simple deployment and total may 50 lines of code each.",1403596866

In my case the reason why the co-founders left wasn&#x27;t told was because the reason was that they thought their partner was too naive and incompetent to work with. Not something so easy to say straight to the face. In hindsight, I think there was no wrong in feeling betrayed in my case, but at the same time the co-founders did no wrong either. We were too inexperienced to handle the situation gracefully. Break-ups can&#x27;t be amicable all the time. Everyone has their side of story.",1403596840

Lots of the old parts of towns here in Italy are that high, and it&#x27;s a nice compromise, because you can pack more people in, but buildings like that don&#x27;t jut out from their surroundings when they&#x27;re all about that high.",1403596815

So far, SSD's are getting cheaper at a much faster rate than demanded capacities are increasing, and (assuming nothing changes the rates, like Blu-ray-sized 400GB movie downloads), it will catch up soon. Firstly just nipping at the heels of the low end, then biting a chunk out of the mainstream, and eventually consuming all but niche applications.<p>It has already caught up for lower capacities e.g., a 1 GB flash drive is cheaper than a 1 GB HDD (fixed costs: $2 vs $40-50), and disrupted hard drives from iPods and netbooks.<p>Meanwhile, desktops PCs themselves are being disrupted by laptops, which are being disrupted by netbooks.",1237193933

If they started a project for the specific purpose of learning a particular skill and they've already learned it, it would make no sense for them to complete it, I think.<p>For example, I once started a bittorrent client in C just to learn how to use sockets and pthreads in C as well as understand the bittorrent protocol. While I never completed it (what would have been the point? there are already way too many out there and I did not have a unique take on the idea), I did accomplish what I set out to do.",1237193035

517911,comment,517825,517825,0,0,HSO,,,"Interesting that the intelligent and concerned blogger at NC says he didn't read the book initially because he heard so much about it already. Don't we all know these books that everybody talks about and seemingly nobody has read. Reminds me of certain assets or investment strategies everybody did and nobody researched. One point that Mandelbrot did not make publicly as far as I know but that NNT makes: Humans _want_ to be suckers. It's comfortable. That's why no amount of blame and regulation will ever stop this cycle. The problem is not people's intelligence, it's their ego.",1237192515
517910,comment,515900,517773,0,0,donaq,,,"Yes, I do think it is more likely, because ""businessperson skills"" are skills that an observant and intelligent person might pick up in the normal course of his life, for example, arithmetic.<p><i>I think business is very simple. Profit. Loss. Take the sales, subtract the costs, you get this big positive number. The math is quite straightforward. - Bill Gates</i><p>Then there's negotiation/persuasion/deal-making/people skills. Most people engage in activities involving variations of those everyday. You'd almost have to be a hermit to <i>avoid</i> picking up <i>some</i> people skills. While some hackers may halfway fit that description, I doubt that most do.<p>Acquiring hacker skills, OTOH, involves rather more specialized effort.",1237192295

FF is starting to become bloat again - and it will eventually be eclipsed by the KHTML based browsers like Chrome simply because they will go back to the Mozilla way rather than the Firefox way<p>These re-designs worry me.",1237192062

They need to tone down the approach significantly -- all of them are too cluttered to really extract the information people will care about. They need to do something bold and h2-like to explain quickly (one sentence, ideally) what Mozilla is, and then say ""Here are our products:"" with big, paragraph-level links, icons, and descriptions to Mozilla's flagships, with miscellaneous/other information at the bottom with modest 200x200 pixel icons and three-four items per line, or something like that. They're going way, way overboard -- this can and should be almost all text that follows the reader's flow and puts all the pertinent information right there. Ads for opensource can be placed below the fold or on a separate page. I'm tempted to do a mockup; Mozilla, feel free to send me money if you want one. ;)",1237190738

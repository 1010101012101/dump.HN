1877488,comment,1875718,1876122,0,0,mkramlich,,,"It's obvious that the OA and thread is not primarily about war. That's obvious. What should have been obvious, I hoped, was that I was making a point about comparing the act we were talking about with another, arguably much much more heinous and violent and massive act, and one that has not been considered a crime. I was trying to put things in perspective. I honestly feel sometimes that America is some Orwellian madhouse when it comes to sex and violence and warfare and say massive financial matters. Weird private things involving two people or a mere $50, where no physical harm is done, and could be attributed to alcohol and misreading body language can be considered much bigger crimes and acts of evil than something involving definite physical damage, or millions or billions of dollars, and the sickening, crippling or loss of thousands or in some cases millions of lives. It's hilarious in some insane tragic way, I think.<p>And you shouldn't imply I'm a troll, that's pretty rude.",1289069981

1877486,comment,1875718,1875718,0,0,jules,,,"A lot of people here are only considering whether what she says is true or not. I do not think it's necessarily so black and white. Let me explain.<p>One one side, there is the possibility that he came to her out of the blue, tried to kiss her, and put his hands in her pants. One the other side, there is the possibility that she is consciously lying about all this (the people arguing that this is a possibility mention previous cases of false accusations).<p>Now, there are three very important things to consider: alcohol, communication and memory.<p>About memory: Memory is not as robust as people think it is, I learned this many years ago. When I was a small kid my dad accused me of destroying some plants he was growing indoors. At first I said ""no I didn't do it"", but then he explained that that could not be the case because I was the only one who likes to pick leaves off plants (which was true). I still persisted that I didn't do it.<p>The next day however, I remembered quite clearly that I was picking the leaves off his plants. So I apologized. And he planted new plants. These new plants got destroyed too, and we discovered that it was the work of mice. Telling the difference between a real memory and a memory of a dream is very hard.<p>So what happened to me was that I remembered something that (1) was completely the opposite of what actually happened (2) it was a memory that portrayed myself in a negative light, and the mind usually tries to remember things so that they show yourself in a positive light. So it seems very unlikely to me that such a completely fake memory could enter my mind. Yet it did.<p>I can definitely imagine that a memory was altered from ""he touched me on my clothes"" to ""he tried to put his hand in my pants"". Especially if you're upset about what happened, and then dream about it. Or perhaps she wasn't as clear about telling him to go away as she remembers. Note that I'm not saying that I believe that this is what happened. I am merely saying that it is a possibility that memory wasn't 100% accurate.<p>About communication: It is possible that she flirted with him (she even mentions that she flirted with guys in the post), and he thought that she was attracted to him.<p>Alcohol: obviously some things happen when people are drunk that wouldn't have happened when they're not. And it doesn't improve memory either.<p>So in addition to the stories:<p>(1) He came to her out of the blue, tried to kiss her, and put his hands in her pants.<p>And:<p>(2) She is consciously lying about all this.<p>This is also a possibility: A girl flirted with a guy. Later that evening, after a few too many beers, the guy went to the girl and tried to kiss her. She pushed him away, but then he put his hands on her hips at the edge of her pants.<p>For that matter, everything between (1) and (2) is possible. So please do not just consider ""Guilty"" vs ""Consciously lying"" as the only possibilities.",1289069933

In most cases, there will be enough evidence offered to support conviction if the jury believes that evidence over the defendant's explanations, and so there is no way for the court to tell if the jury convicted because they felt the defendant was guilty, or if they convicted because they don't like the defendant's race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.<p>The Framers understood this, which is why they didn't require juries to be told of the nullification power.

(got that piece of info from early MySQL folks). If a small site, forum, or blog can't scale easily on a relational database it is because the developer doesn't know what they're doing. You can make an argument that relational solutions aren't user friendly because they have defaults not suited for small, high-performance sites, or too many features that cripple performance if not used correctly, but IMO that's a silly argument. People don't blame a programming language because their program is slow since they used a O(2^N) algorithm where O(N log N) suffices. Why do people blame a DBMS when they write nonsensical queries that couldn't possibly evaluate in real-time merely for giving them an option to write such queries?<p><i>Also it's not just a matter of scalability: latency is a very important constraint.</i><p>Many relational databases have sophisticated schedulers that reorder events to maximize queries per second, unless an event has been in the pipe for too long, in which case it is given higher priority and pushed through faster. Most NoSQL products do not even begin to approach this level of sophistication. Even MySQL gives excellent latency characteristics if you know what you're doing - just ask the Facebook folks, they're <i>very</i> serious about latency. Good latency performance is certainly not restricted to NoSQL stores.<p>Most SQL vs. NoSQL debates usually have the same resolution: traditional DBMSes let you shoot yourself in the foot, while NoSQL solutions usually don't. With a traditional DBMS you better know what you're doing, while with a NoSQL solution you can usually get away with just jumping into it. Nine times out of ten, that's the value proposition. Most of the time it isn't performance, latency, a better/different data model, or anything of the sort.",1289067886

She runs the risk of being socially shunned, but she's unlikely to have this happen to her again at a similar conference.<p>Yes, one could argue that this would have been as effective by leaving the perpetrator anonymous, and I'd agree.

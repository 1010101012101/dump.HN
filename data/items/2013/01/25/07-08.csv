You don't want <i>complete</i> chaos, because things also have to ""make sense"" to some degree (so complete randomness, like a stereotypical suburban cul-de-sac maze, tends to be bad), but variation is a good thing.<p>[A nice city to look at for interesting approaches to urban structure which are both somewhat regular, but more interesting that a grid, is Edinburgh, which has seen successive waves of fairly successful urban renewal over centuries, resulting in one of the most beautiful and fascinating cities in Europe.  In the ""new"" parts (150-250 years old as opposed to the older and more organic medieval parts), Edinburgh streets have such features as small localized grids, sized as to with care to avoid large-scale monotony, occasional ""circuses"" acting as focal points, streets in gentle arcs which are practical for transportation, and yet maintain a constantly evolving street view and horizon, terraces along the sides of parks, etc.]",1359100505

It was more like brain training in Supply Chain Management (the execution of the mentioned low and high margin strategies if you want). Now, Low vs. High margins looks more than just obvious.<p>What I came up with, and please feel free to give feed-back, as one big difference between Amazon and Apple is the product range. Amazon has orders of magnitude more products and commodities than Apple. What makes it eassier (not easy, mind you, just easier) for Apple to manage their supply chain. You can see this in their release schedule, everthing is planned according to that. Hard to do with thousands of product lines. In this area, Apple is really doing great in the planning part of supply chain management, from my outside perspective they are a benchmark here for everybody else. Plus, one could argue their supply chain strategy matches perfectl their business strategy.<p>Amazon on the other excels at the logistics part of supply chain management. As mentioned in the article, they have to in order to get their low margins and high customer satisfaction. Currently, I'd say Amazon is doing to logistics what Toyota did up to the lets say 80s and Wal-Mart did up to the early 2000s (no coincidence that Amazon hired Wal-Mart people back then).<p>What both companies have in comon is really good view of Point-of-Sales data. Big difference here to most other companies around.<p>How does all that match with high and low margins? In the place of Apple excellence in supply chain planning is used in combination with a narrow product range to allow for high margins and high inventory turn rates (again, a narrow product range is helping a lot here). Supplier management is critical point here, too.<p>In the place of Amazon logistic excellence is used to run an very efficient ditribution network. This efficiency allows them things like next-day delivery and their low margins. Think Toyota Production System and Lean and all the businesses that tried to copy that since the late ninties.<p>So, as long as both companies can keep their respective levels of operational performance up I don't think they are in trouble.<p>Back on the OP, the low margin-attack was what the whole Android industry did on Apple, Samsung in particular. But Samsung is different story all together.",1359098852

5114441,comment,5109847,5110719,1,0,b0o,,,"Well, MOST of the world has cheap (below $10 USD) prepaid plans like europe, I think japan is an exception where ""cheap"" calls using prepaid sim cards is very difficult (nearly impossible) to get because the three most popular providers docomo, au, Softbank all have very steep prices for just calls. The situation is even worse for prepaid data plans (~$25/mb using Softbank, insane. Texts were also $2.50/text, so that's not an option either). Their reasoning is to prevent criminals from buying burners. And if your phone is locked then you would have no choice but to rent their phones for about $50/week or $200/month, to put it into a monthly contract perspective.<p>There are a few exceptions such as buying from other networks besides the big three but those networks don't work in non-metropolitan areas (i.e. outside of tokyo, kyoto, or most major cities), and that's when you might need your phone the most, especially if you can't speak Japanese.<p>The loopholes: using wifi to gvoice call internationally at $0.11/min in Japan, or payphones, because receiving calls is free. I digress, but to explain the situation, I found a store (Mobal) at narita int'l airport that gave free SIM cards where you ""pay as you go"" at around $2.50/min (the other stores charge ~$1.50/min but you needed to pay $25 flat fee and then a rate of $1.50/min), but I also bought a portable wifi router so that I could make internet calls through gvoice for $0.11/min (or free calls back home in the U.S.) and you can avoid paying them as long as you can make wifi calls (free wifi isn't as common in japan as everyone thinks).",1359098473

Between out of order execution, hyperthreading, caches, prefetching, pretending-to-be-uniform-memory-access-but-not-actually-being-it and concurrency the degree to which C's computer model is relevant is rapidly shrinking.  We don't really have a good model for this, but that's not really a good excuse to keep writing new languages based on C.",1255737418

But actually, if you're dealing with things on a tree by tree basis, you're not getting much done. And you can pretty lose your way by focusing on navigating territory efficiently at that level, but not keeping track of the overall goal.<p>As to whether kernel code should be written in C, that is a different matter. C is not a good map to von Neumann architectures because it doesn't model shared code and data in memory - C doesn't have a good representation for writing code at runtime. Most code written in C will not be the most efficient possible code for this reason.",1255737044

Social engineering would be convincing the user person-to-person to give up their password (as with a phone call).<p>Phishing scams and virus emails are social engineering in that they are conning the user into taking an action. You're not 'conning' the user into entering their password, you are just making it look like the system is normal and the user is entering their password on their own (because they are looking for access to the system).  It would no more be a social engineering hack if you were to make a duplicate laptop with <i>only</i> a keylogger on it, and then burst into the room guns-blazing once they tried to log in with the password.<p>Maybe I'm off here but most social engineering has to do with convincing the user to trust 'you' where 'you' can be an unsolicited email telling them to send money to Nigeria, or a person on the phone claiming to need their password to 'reset their account.' In the case of this attack (or a keylogger), they are trusting something that they already trust, their laptop. You're not 'convincing' them to trust their laptop.

There's a nonprofit advocacy group for the rights of the mentally handicapped called ""Friends of the Retarded"". At the time it was founded, that was the most euphemistic and inoffensive name that came to mind. ""Slow"" was too insulting, so they had to replace it with a Latin-derived synonym. Now anyone that makes a bad move while playing blindfolded chess is instantly a retard. Similarly, ""idiot"", ""moron"", and ""imbecile"" were once scientific terms to describe different severities of retardation.<p>""Autistic"" is especially justified, because the connotation of ""geek"" has shifted from a definite negative to a mild positive.

That's been feasible for a long time. Why not? What about video would make you start?<p>Omni-directional mikes would pick up too much; directional would be inconvenient to aim. Video is vastly easier to navigate, since we think spatially and visually - how do you scroll through an audio recording? With video, you get feedback as to where you are temporally, especially if there's movement from place to place; with audio, you just randomly fastforward hoping to get nearer where you want to hear, if you can even recognize progress towards or away from the clip you want. (An example: I have a video of a boardwalk, versus audio, and I want to look at an encounter. Will it be easier for me to find that encounter if I can look at the video, or if I just have to listen to random ambience & chit-chat?)<p>Further, video picks up written material, it will pick up gestures and body language of speakers, and, incidentally (and importantly for the hard-of-hearing, like me) makes spoken language <i>much</i> clearer because you can do some lip-reading.<p>And remember the practical uses thought of for lifelogging; how would an audio recording help you in traffic court?

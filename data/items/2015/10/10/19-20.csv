10366775,comment,10365734,10365734,0,0,tptacek,,,"I don&#x27;t understand the argument here.<p>The TPP is not itself a law. It&#x27;s a meta-law, which commits its signatories to enact actual enforceable laws based on the framework established in the treaty.<p>No device can be destroyed &quot;under the TPP&quot;. The TPP instead demands that its signatories enact laws so that they have a judicial process whose remedies can potentially include the destruction of devices. The TPP hasn&#x27;t even been ratified yet, let alone enabled by law.<p>This seems like hair-splitting, but I don&#x27;t think it is. I think the question of what impact TPP will have on security research depends entirely on what the enabling laws for the TPP look like in each country. In the US, our laws already cordon off security and interoperability research from anti-circumvention enforcement.<p>The TPP itself also acknowledges non-infringing use. First, note that the Vice article selectively quotes the leaked TPP text, which does not demand destruction of &quot;anti-circumvention devices&quot;, but rather of devices engaged in <i>prohibited activity</i>. The TPP does not demand a prohibition on security research. Further, the TPP earlier (QQ.G.17) binds each party to balance IP law with fair use for criticism, comment, and research.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that the TPP IP law is going to be a good thing for security research. It probably won&#x27;t be (at least, not outside the US). But it&#x27;s too early to know what it&#x27;s impact is going to be, and certainly to early to say that it&#x27;s going to result in the confiscation of security researcher laptops.",1444507158

10366766,comment,10364588,10366245,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"... There&#x27;s zero evidence that consciousness exists outside of the physical world. There&#x27;s plenty of evidence that it does exist as something brains create. There&#x27;s plenty of evidence that poking it chemically or otherwise causes changes in consciousness. In some cases, scientists have some ideas about how that might sorta happen (like the release of dopamine or serotonin). No one seems to disagree that taking, say, Xanax, does something to brain chemistry and causes e.g. less anxiety.<p>LSD is certainly a physical chemical that goes into physical brains. Yet all of a sudden folks want to introduce a separate magisterium and insist that despite having every appearance of acting on the brain somehow, LSD is special and really does <i>something more</i>. And not because of any extraordinary evidence, but because, while they were tripping, they thought up some cool neato thought like, I dunno, all people are one. A thought they can&#x27;t verify at all, but makes sense while tripping. And because of that, not only is their neato thought true, but LSD itself must be something paranormal because other drugs don&#x27;t let them think nonsense is true.<p>That&#x27;s essentially all of what Leary and others come down to, despite hiding it in a lot more verbiage and nicer sounding ideas.<p>Just because the understanding of consciousness is rather much in its infancy doesn&#x27;t give people blank checks to make shit up. LSD-fueled and valid-only-with-acid ideas on consciousness should be given as much weight as LSD-fueled pictures of Pluto.",1444507015

But if you&#x27;re trying to optimize a metric, such as savings (which can be included as an expense category to visualize savings rate), it makes it intuitive to see which budget categories are throwing you off. Suddenly it&#x27;s not about reducing expenses, but rather shifting them between categories of a whole. At 50%, there is a tipping point where the pie slice becomes concave. If you&#x27;re trying to push yourself to a 50% savings rate, it&#x27;s an interesting visual benchmark.<p>For portfolios, here are a few examples.

10366711,story,,,1,0,chasb,"Aptible is hiring senior site reliability engineers",,"Aptible is looking for a site reliability engineer to help build and run our platforms. Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptibleâs mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. Itâs founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We arenât the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. Itâs a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. Weâve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, youâll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, youâll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which weâre built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, youâll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. Youâre always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, youâll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company thatâs growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage â 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, âunlimited vacationâ means âno vacation.â We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you donât do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews",1444506224

ATTiny is about 2 Cents more but that can change.  \nThe cheapest 8051 from Energy micro is in the same range as well.<p>The cheapest ARM Cortex M3/M0 or even a ARM7 is $1+. When you are shipping products (and not doing a hobby project), BOM cost is a major factor. If you sell a Million Units each with a micro in them, the cost difference is about $700,000. Even keeping cost aside, size matters. The smallest 8 Bit micros from Atmel or Microchip or any 8051 is around 3x3mm. Most ARM micros are much larger.<p>Rule of thumb that I use is to pick the micro by function, price and size. Sometimes a 8-Bit micro is more than enough for the job. Buying something that costs more, bigger in size and for which the MHz is not an advantage is an overkill.<p>Having said that, a companion product that also working on requires the MHz and so, a Cortex-M3 fits perfects there.",1444506177

The second most common reason was not needing or wanting an account, although a larger percentage of never-banked households (26.0 percent) cited this reason than did previously banked households (15.6 percent). This finding implies that households that have had a bank account in the past may place more value on a banking relationship than those that have not.<p>> For nearly 10 percent (9.5 percent) of previously banked households, the main reason they do not currently have an account is that the bank closed their account. Another 5.5 percent of previously banked households cannot open an account because of identification (ID), credit, or banking history problems. This suggests that about 15 percent of previously banked households may not choose to be unbanked but face institutional barriers related to opening or maintaining an account.<p>> High bank account fees or minimum balance requirements were the main obstacles to account ownership for slightly more than 5 percent of unbanked households. However, recently unbanked households were more likely than others to cite fees as an obstacle: more than one in ten (11.1 percent) households that had a bank account in the last year were currently unbanked because of high fees and balance requirements, compared to 6.0 percent of previously banked households that had an account over a year ago. ...",1444506123

10366667,comment,10343830,10343830,0,0,cmcleod,,,"There absolutely IS such a thing as optimal kerning. But, my take, as someone who has done it many, many times is that âoptimalâ means you do it, rather than you donât do it.<p>In fact, thereâs even a commonly used formula for it, thoughâto the best of my knowledgeânot written in code. Good designers are taught this formula at one point or another. (And once you know the formula, you know who hasnât been taught.)<p>This is probably going to be a way longer answer than expected, but if anyone wants to take this and do an excellent job automating it into design software, I will be a huge fan.<p>A) First thing, just to make sure weâre all on the same page:<p>Kerning = the space in-between two letters. ONLY two letters. Tracking/letter-spacing = the space between all of the letters in a body of text. And when altered, applied to an entire body of text.<p>B) Second thing: Defining âoptimalâ<p>Most typefaces/fonts are designed for average use. That is to say, its optimal state is as paragraph text. When you make text really big, like in a headline, sometimes weird spaces show up between letters. These spaces donât matter at small sizes but make the letters look cheap and amateurish when theyâre big. And, they look unprofessional when the word is important, like a logo. So, kerning manipulates the space between letters to make the word or words look more professional and considered.<p>(This is the crux of designersâ analysis of Alphabetâs logoâitâs freaking Google. Itâs worth getting it right.)<p>C) Third thing: The Formula, or How To Kern<p>Hereâs the secret: itâs hard to perfectly kern something when youâre looking at the entire word. So, donât look at the entire word. Look at three letters at a time. Cover the others up with paper (a sticky note works well for screens). For those three letters, make sure that middle letter looks balanced and not like itâs drifting to one side or another. You can manipulate that space by moving either the first, second, or third letter. You can make the whole set wider. You can make the whole set narrower. Youâre in charge. Just make it balanced.<p>Then, shift your three letter âwindowâ to the right or left (I recommend right) by one character. Moving ONLY that new character, make it balanced with the two from the original set.\nThen repeat that process until you finish the whole word. And then go back and adjust the whole thing all over again if it still looks unbalanced.<p>Thereâs a reason you typically only kern logos or reasonably short headlines. It takes forever.<p>D) Fourth thing: Kerning affects the âvibeâ of the logo<p>Tight kerning where the letters touch or almost touch each other feels big, corporate, and sometimes a little dated. Think: FedEx, Newsweek, Infosys, or Oracle.<p>Really wide kerning where the letters are quite far from each other tends to feel futuristic and elite. And, these are almost always in all-caps. Think: Uber, Prada, and approximately one million hipster logos from 2013. And take my word on this one, you should just never bother with a spaced out word or logo thatâs upper and lower case. Just let that idea go, please. Not worth the aesthetic agony and designer backlash.<p>Last but not least: Reasonable kerning widths, where there is space between letters but not tons of space, feel like the ânorm coreâ of kerning. Which (in my opinion) is a good thing. And this is what Alphabetâs logo is going for. Itâs neutral, and feels humble, but smart. More down-to-earth than wide kerning, and more youthful than tight kerning.<p>Pro-tip: Reasonably normal kerning widths in all caps can look amateurish. Consider making the spaces bigger (more Uber-ish) or switching to upper and lowercase.<p>If you read through all of that, thank you for your time.<p>My tip to someone who would like to automate this process using a datasetâmake you have data from different type sizes, because type size is the biggest determining factor in âoptimalâ kerning.\nGood luck!",1444505516

When the managers have run the ship aground to the extent that capable engineers that were hired to build product are now going to loose their jobs, there have been some huge errors and missteps. Getting back from that is going to be very difficult, and imagine now trying to attract technical talent to a company that has just cut technical staff; the best and brightest are going to have better options so Twitter is going to be at a disadvantage in the general labor market. This means they will have a harder time finding people, keeping people, staffing projects.

Now, I have to wire transfer the funds in advance, wait for the transfer to clear and then come in to get the car. I certainly don&#x27;t risk being mugged on my way to the dealer (in broad daylight, without advertising everyone, e.g. on social networks, that today I am buying a car and waving the wad of cash in a selfie). But if the limited liability company with 6,000 EUR liability deposit bankrupts, I will have neither the money (wire transfer have nothing like cashback on credit cards) nor the car until a lengthy legal process hoping that they have enough funds and property to pay out all creditors... You don&#x27;t risk mugging but have to do way larger due diligence, check finance health of the company, ask around for customer feedback on the company, etc.",1444503621

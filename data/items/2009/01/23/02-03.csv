However, an argument can be based on sound principles and be can be totally supportable, and yet due to limited speaking or writing abilities of the adherent, not be convincing. Of course the other is also true, a good writer or speaker can successfully convince a reader or listener of a totally false premise.<p>I see several skills necessary to successfully and accurately lay out a position. They are:<p>1. Ability to write or speak\n2. Depth of knowledge about the subject\n3. Ability to listen to or read material and understand it to a depth beyond the superficial.\n4. Ability to analyse--this implies an IQ at least as high as the speaker or writer.\n5, Access to additional material pertinent to the subject\n6. A world view relatively free from preconceived notions of reality.<p>I am reminded that when I have arguments about politics, conservative versis liberal; ie which is a better philosophy--the question has to be asked, compared to what, for what purpose, etc.  The argument to me can have no resolution.",1232679213

Sometimes I'll churn through till 9am without even noticing.<p>This style of work tends to occassionally push my sleep cycle around in funny ways. After intensive ""sprints"" it's not uncommon for me to have a week where I wake up at 6pm in the evening. That seems to be my recovery mode then, I don't get anything done in these weeks.<p>But sometimes, towards the end of such a recovery week, I notice the same thing that you mention. As I slowly adjust my cycle back towards the accepted norm there is often a period where I get up between 2-4am and many of these days have turned out amazingly productive, too.<p>Sometimes I wish I could just sustain either one of these rhythms (either getting up very early or getting up midday and working late) but for some reason I'm always slipping towards the ""recovery state"" after a few weeks.

I had abandoned this based on lack of interest from the few people I contacted but thought I'd check with the community to see if anybody here would find this useful before sending it to the recycle bin.<p>The problem: You have super-critical data on s3 and want to have better uptime than s3 currently does because of the nature of the data (say medical records).<p>The solution: You now have another s3 implementation on another cloud (GAE) that you can seamlessly switch to (repoint dns). There will be periodic syncs between amazon's s3 and GAE's s3. You've essentially added a couple of 9s to the reliability of S3 and get to reuse the same code you have written against s3. The caveat is that it's not free since you've doubled your data storage costs (amzn + google).<p>There are some serious limitations with GAE (1 MB limit), reliability etc. But those should go away eventually.<p>I can set up a demo quickly if there is interest. I'll probably be working on another project fulltime soon. Let me know if you want to run with it too.",1232677644

I completely agree that there is nothing special about Lisp-class languages rather than those of other classes. In fact, I would go further. Having implemented a small Scheme on .Net and also having read thru most of the Clojure code on the JVM, I'd guess that the OO/statically typed nature of both platforms gets in the way of Lisp-like languages more than those of other paradigms. So, in effect, I may ""more than"" agree with you.<p>>> You're saying, in effect, that a language with s-expression syntax needs the extra boost of being on a popular VM to make it.<p>Actually, my guess is that all future non-DSL languages are going to need to be built on a popular VM/framework in order to succeed, because of the advantages I listed in my earlier post. A DSL can get by without a popular platform because, by definition, it doesn't extend beyond its narrow scope and thus doesn't need access to a broad range of libraries. Also, DSLs don't tend to be performance sensitive and therefore don't need the compiler optimizations.<p>What I was really responding to was the fact that you are the co-author of Arc, and I was (wrongly) seeing your post in that context. My apologies for confusing the issue, although I do think that the point I'm driving at is an important one.",1232676954

While Chrome's dev tools aren't quite as robust as FireFox's, they're getting there very very quickly.<p>On a side note, I'm tired of having to design and develop around IE. All versions have the promise of adhering to modern web standards, but with each release, they tend to fall short of those promises.",1322751597

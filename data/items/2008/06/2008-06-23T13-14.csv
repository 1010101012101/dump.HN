225107,comment,224861,224861,0,0,coglethorpe,,,"One thing I've learned is that there are many people like the  plumber mentioned in the article that do better than many Ivy League grads financially.  I know one person who has a two-year degree, worked as an electrician, and built his business to where he's one of the wealthiest people I personally know.  Another sold his junk yard (which made him good money for years) for over a million.  According to the book ""The Millionaire Mind"" there's plenty of folks like that and just as many graduates of big schools who live paycheck to paycheck to show how ""rich"" they are.",1214229277

225102,comment,224520,224661,0,0,krschultz,,,"You don't find girls at parties. Truthfully, you don't WANT to find girls at a party. Any girl after the first month of freshman year who will hook up with someone she met at a party - has already done so. The best route is to find an activity that you like and meet people through that, then you actually have something in common and a chance to spend time talking sober. That forges real relationships, which ultimately are a lot better because you have someone to lean on not just someone to hook up with. But truthfully, having someone is important and hardly precludes you from being in a successful startup. There are 20 of us now at my startup and only 1 or 2 are single.",1214228985

A lot of what was said in the article reminds me of him.<p>Having excessively high expectations for his kids (or, you could say, excessively narrow) is the worst of it.  I want to tell him, you have three kids, odds are they are not <i>all</i> going to be Ivy League scholars.  But he can't imagine any other future for them.  Going to be rough on him and his kids alike, I'm afraid.",1214228898

Knowing those topics reveals certain tricks to talking to different people. ""Ask the expert"", where you compliment someone on their skill or knowledge (plumbing, say) and then ask them for more details, showing genuine interest as they talk. People who have kids or pets are also pretty easy to talk to, because they're proud and love to talk about them. Humor, sports, and local news also tend to break the ice.<p>So I'm truly curious what's at work behind this inability or unwillingness to talk to ""the masses"", as it were.",1214227034

225076,comment,223846,224311,0,0,ced,,,"I went for the sound bite, but the truth is: I left grad school last December, and I've been in Turkey ever since. I'll likely move to India in a few months.<p>Turkey outside of Istanbul is rather cheap, but not incredibly so. My nice 4-bedroom flat is 400 euros/month in a good student neighborhood (split with my 3 roomies of course). A very good student meal is around 4 euros, so we eat out a lot. The fruits/vegetables are ridiculously cheap in bazaars. People are really friendly and helpful, though it's hard to find people who are... different, for lack of better term. The uni libraries suck in Izmir, which is bad for me.<p>Staying with Erasmus students turned out to be best for me. Living with Turkish men has proven... difficult, and the culture doesn't really allow mixed-sex appartment sharing before marriage.<p>I never did it, but you can get 15 Euro/hour teaching English here, which is really good money for Izmir.<p>Everything else I've heard second-hand, so you might have more luck with Google. India is supposed to be dirt cheap (7 euros/night reasonable hotels). I'll go there alone and network my way into an appartment. My roomie went to Iran for two weeks, and it seems so interesting, culturally. If there wasn't the threat of a looming war, I'd stay some time there before moving more to the east.<p>Finally: moving/finding an appartment is very costly, both in time and money. Changing country is even moreso. If you're staying less than 4 months in a city, you're not really living there, you're just travelling. (nothing wrong with that of course, but my goal is to get work done and learn as much as I can)<p>Feel free to email. I wish I knew more people doing what I'm doing.",1214226503

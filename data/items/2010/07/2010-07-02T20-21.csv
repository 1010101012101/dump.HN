The top tiers are often a very insular world all its own, it's no surprise they're changing so very slowly.  Sad, but not surprising.<p>Pay-gaps measuring across the board are rather meaningless, aside from showing a cultural bias for <i>hiring</i>.  There's definitely a significant pay gap, but a lot of articles like that one take male-income / num-males and compare it to female-income / num-females.  More point-by-point comparisons show a smaller gap per-job (I usually see 5%, sometimes 10%.  Significant, but not 25% significant like the article lists).  For psychiatry in <i>particular</i>, it's also become an over-crowded field; to compete, and to get the average-joe on their bill, the average-joe psychiatrist must lower their cost.<p>edit: as linked by tokenadult, I point this out for <i>consideration</i> of the results, but not as an <i>explanation</i>: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox#Berkeley_sex_bias_case"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox#Berkeley_se...</a><p>I'm not discounting the entire thing by any means, most of the purpose in the comment is because the issues around child-care are utterly ridiculous.  I've run across a fair number of men who have run flat against (spiked) brick walls in their attempts, followed by rather massive repercussions for simply <i>trying</i> to be single fathers (lost jobs, criminal investigations (finding nothing), near-eviction from their community, etc).  I've not heard of parallel situations for females as bad as many of them have encountered, in relatively recent years.

1482324,comment,1479107,1479910,0,0,sedachv,,,"Doing these kinds of searches is the next great business opportunity in online travel. When you buy a flight ticket, what the airline is really selling is a fare - a pre-made package of one or more flights, on one or more partner airlines, with specific restrictions and price. QPX (and all other flight search engines) don't search specific flights - they search fares.<p>If you miss a connecting flight, you will be re-booked on the next flight, but it all stays within the context of your fare. Not so if you split up your journey into two distinct tickets. However, a lot of people won't mind this.<p>In your example, you can split up your travel dates, and use part of the $1600 you saved to stay a few days in New York. I like to do exactly this - the cheapest trans-Atlantic flights are offered by charter airlines from London, and I like to make time for a few days stay there when flying from continental Europe.<p>Not a big chance of missing your next flight with that kind of window. Even if you know you are going to miss the next flight, with most airlines (but very rarely with charters) you can re-book up to an hour or so before boarding, for a fee that may be less than the difference in ticket prices you would have paid anyway.<p>This also works for round-trip flights. I often book round-trip flights as two different tickets. A lot of the time it is cheaper, but it also offers more flexibility (remember, you have to pay change fee <i>and</i> ticket price differences - and the airline might only have expensive fares available!) in case you want to change one of the departure or return flights (but obviously not both, as then you're paying 2x the change fees).<p>Of course, what I haven't said yet is how difficult this will be to pull off. Any travel company that does this will be boycotted by all major airlines. Many fares you're bound to buy this way are sold at a loss (better to sell for something than have an 80% empty plane flying and get nothing is one way to put it; there really is no easy way to price flights - most airlines have teams of math and OR PhDs working on pricing). The multi-flight fares usually have a larger margin tacked on.<p>The only way to solve this problem is really to nuke the existing fare system and start over. As long as ""flagship"" airlines keep getting bailed out by the government, they will be able to undercut the competition (and themselves) into bankruptcy with the irrational fare arrangements.",1278104008

Free Will points at our desire to think that our actions aren't determined by our universe, i.e. the desire to separate oneself from the observed determinism of our own universe.<p>It ain't gonna happen so long as you are capable of thinking. If you are thinking, you are determining your will.<p>Can't live a happy life without Free Will? I'm perfectly happy knowing that my thoughts, actions, and wants are a timeless pseudo-determined reality of this Universe. I feel at one with everything around me including people and inanimate objects. Why can't you?<p>Probably because some of us are conditioned to reject authority, and what bigger authority than the big U? Guess what... the way the universe appears to you is determined by the way you think. For example, just about everyone sees time as always moving forward. Why is thermodynamics and entropy the way it is? Because that is how we think, in terms of time/causality/consequences. If you reject the observed determinism of your universe, you are really just rejecting the process of your mind.<p>Which is fine, reject your brain if you want.

A new frame environment is cloned for the function instance with all the current variable values sealed.  That's why it's called a closure; it's closed, sealed, that no one has access to it except the particular function instance.<p>Javascript cheats in its closure implementation.  It doesn't create a new frame environment for each inner function instance, instead just references back to the parent's frame environment.

Of course, you need a very large and almost complete social graph in order for this type of clustering to be accurate. I'm a huge fan of the linear algebraic techniques used in network analysis. There is definitely a way to have most of the hard work done algorithmically, presenting the user with an analysis of his own social network, lumping people in to suggested groups, for example. It wouldn't work 100%, as no algorithm is going to properly be able to handle the subtle nuances of a given individuals rationale for grouping people together, but it could get very, very close.<p>You could add further inputs to the clustering mechanism by taking in to account each node's own reclassification of its social groups. Run the algorithm, give all the users a generated list of social groups, and as each user updates and fixes the lists, re-input those updates in to the clustering algorithm. By giving the nodes in the graph an opinion, the algorithm could be refined and made to be more accurate when there are future changes to the graph.<p>Oh the weeks of fun I could have with access to Facebook's social graph...",1278103516

1482283,comment,1481551,1481981,0,0,chanakya,,,"I see what you're saying, but 'expanding the business' is a bit of a euphemism. The article gets almost everything wrong, but I think it has a good definition of outsourcing/offshoring that works:  save a ton of money and ship quality software. The article claims this almost never happens, but make no mistake, this is exactly what is happening from the better centers. The cost differences are enormous, Indian cost often being no more than a quarter to a third of US ones. The article has a lot of nonsense about why great Indian devs will 'charge' the same as what US ones do (as if they have the power of market makers), but the reality is that you really can get great teams at a fraction of US costs.  <p> 
Another reason to call it offshoring is that every time the company stock is under pressure, US top management wants to let go some people in the US and move more to the India office. This is often not what the India teams want. Over the years, they've developed strong relationships with devs in the US office, with respect for their abilities and acknowledgement of having learnt a lot from them, and don't want to see themselves as taking away the US devs' jobs. The best devs in india want to go off and do new things they've thought of themselves, but are pulled into 'transitioning' new stuff. Managements are the same everywhere, and these kind of things don't  figure in their calculus.",1278103289

The really aren't very many business requirements that are, by themselves, complicated. The complexity comes from a foolish and pointless attempt to deal with all of them at once by developing a framework rather than an application. The sorts of developers that work in enterprises tend to be the sort that don't realize that they're abusing the classic software anti-patterns and making things far worse.<p>Another problem is due to who makes the decisions about what to buy and what the requirements for in-house software are. It's rarely someone who has any connection to the solution, but rather a manager or executive with an agenda, which occasionally has some relation to the software's purpose, but more often has to do with brown-nosing.<p>One example is Visual J++. At one point, Microsoft had gotten Visual J++ into something like 70% of Java development shops in the US. They did this by marketing directly to clueless executives who didn't know the first thing about whether or not it was suitable to the task at hand, rather than to the developers who were in reality using a standard Java JDK and a free (or cheap, back then there were several of both available) IDE instead.",1278100970

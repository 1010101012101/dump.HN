136067,story,,,19,50,eznet,"Ask YC: What do I, a graduating CS student, need to know to go into the real world as a programmer?",,"What do I, a new graduate, need to make sure I know to land a decent job in the 'real world' as a programmer?  I am graduating in less than 2 months with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science (BSACS) and feel clueless about what is approaching rapidly - a.k.a THE REAL WORLD.  I know this question has been asked and answered countless times (most of which I feel that I have read), but as is the case with all in the tech world, often this information becomes dated rapidly, is one sided or extremely biased.  So again, what concepts, technologies, languages and various disciplines do I need to KNOW in order to be proficient, or at least to be good enough to land a job, as a professional programmer?<p>I find myself feeling as if I know all this 'programming stuff' but have no real clue of how to sit down and work in a development environment with other developers on a real project.  Not only this, but I feel that I know a little about a lot - i.e. I am a jack of all trades, but a master of none. Clearly I have done problem solving and system design in my classes, but these projects are limited to core concepts based heavily on CS theory and are often very limited in size and complexity.  I have been exposed to C++ (4 classes), Java (2 classes), VB.Net (1 Class), SQL (1 class), Discrete Mathematics (1 class), Project design and management (1 class), Advanced Algorithms and Design (1 class) as well as a sprinkling of various other 'CS-related' classes via my education.  On the side I have played and dabbled with Ruby, Python, PHP, C, C# and a handful of other technologies that escape me now.  I have a 3.6 GPA and have not made less than an A in my core CS classes since the beginning, but again, I still feel clueless.<p>Any tips, suggestions or criticisms are warmly welcomed (well, except criticism, which will be welcomed, just without the warm feelings attached).  Please, where time and willingness permits, be specific - do I need to know how to design/write a compiler?  do I need to know assembly (taking that class this term anyways)?  If I want to make money first and worry about fun later, should I focus on corporate adopted technologies (Java, anything Microsoft, etc.)?<p>Thanks in advance!<p>-Matt",1205427113

136055,comment,135945,136001,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> what [...] volume of reading is [diminishing returns] reached?<p>I think the volume is pretty damn low if you limit your intake to dense, high quality sources.  The key word here is <i>actionable</i>.  How often do you come across something that actually changes your plans or the way you're doing things?  It's really very rare, in any field.  It certainly doesn't require a daily investment, and probably not even a weekly investment.<p>A few time I've either been traveling or in crunch mode for a few weeks and been unable to waste time perusing the journals and feeds I usually do.  When I finally had a chance to catch up, I found that I could rapidly skim the pile of stuff I would have wasted many hours reading and pick out all the salient information in under an hour.<p>It's also important to remember we live in the google age and finding information is easy.  There's a tendency to suck down information thinking it might be handy later, but a JIT approach to reading and research is probably a lot more efficient.  When what to do isn't obvious you can find what's been written fast.  Remember that you probably have access through your library to lexis-nexis and other databases that allow you to search pretty much everything that gets published.<p>People like to procrastinate by reading blogs and ""news items"" and pretend they're actually doing useful research.  In terms of real applicability they'd usually do just as well reading Seventeen Magazine.  I'm as guilty as anyone, of course.",1205425876

A good friend of mine has had a merchant account with them for years with no problems. Their interface is is pretty good too.<p>Transferring out of GoDaddy is a challenge though (but it feels great once you finally rip your domains out of their cold, dead hands). They make the process convoluted and confusing, hoping you'll give up. But don't give up (never give up!). Here's what you have to do:<p>- log in to GD and go to the domain manager. Go to each domain individually and check to see if the domain privacy proxy is turned on. If it is, it means that your whois info is being proxied by <a href=""http://domainsbyproxy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domainsbyproxy.com/</a> (it seems to be a sister site to GD). You need to find your account number for DBP which they would have sent to you when you reg'd the domain. You need to login to DBP and disable the proxy for all of your domains.<p>- Go back to GD and you'll notice the proxy is now off (magic!). You now need to unlock each domain and get an Authorization Code for each one by clicking the send Auth Code By Email link on the domain screen. Most (all?) registrars will request this when you initiate the transfer.<p>- Go to your new registrar and initiate the transfer (this is where you'll need the auth code).<p>- The new registrar will send an email to the administrative contact for the domain(s) confirming the start of the transfer. You may have to wait up to a day or so to get this.<p>- GD will send an email confirming the transfer is started. You can also check GD periodically because eventually they will display your domains as Transfer/Pending. Go to the My Domains page, mouse over the Domains tab and click pending transfers. Select all of your domains and click the ""Accept/Decline"" icon (it's a very confusing icon) and choose accept (obviously) and be sure to click all the Okays.<p>And you're done! If you use GoDaddy's DNS servers you may have to reconfigure your DNS and mail settings (maybe someone else has experience with that?). If you already use a 3rd party for DNS and mail then the transfer shouldn't affect your site/email.",1205424842

Why?  To learn the nitty-gritty details of DOM manipulation and browser compatibility.<p>* I de-normalised the database from the start.  Why? Because it enabled me to build a simple, light and fast object-oriented table wrapper without the overhead of dealing with associations, joins, and so forth.

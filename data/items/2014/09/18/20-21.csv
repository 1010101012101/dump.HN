At that point something more or less broke in this country and in the western world more generally which has put us into a zone where there’s much slower technological progress.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve believed for years that we entered something like a minor dark age (dim age?) on or about 1970, and that computers have become synonymous with &quot;technology&quot; because it was the only sector that didn&#x27;t get the memo. Everything else basically stopped cold around 1970, and some fields (e.g. aerospace) have actually gone into reverse.<p>I am very heartened to see people with the fame and fortune of Peter Thiel et. al. raising this issue and basically agreeing, but I have yet to see an explanation that truly seems to work.<p>Peter I think oversells libertarianism when he blames regulation-- while regulation slows progress by increasing costs and making experimentation hard, free markets&#x27; reluctance to invest in &quot;zero to one&quot; ideas <i>also</i> slows progress. Nearly all the &quot;zero to one&quot; stories I am familiar with were government funded, usually in a time of war or threat of war. VCs and other investors normally want to fund &quot;one to N&quot; ideas because there is at least a provable market there and the hard stuff is mostly done already.<p>I&#x27;ve got some other ideas but I&#x27;m curious about what HN thinks.",1411073561

Will be interesting to watch the short interest on this company!<p>I think the two headed CEO is what the street expected all along as Catz has been around for ever and alot of people thought that Hurd, the former HP CEO, was promised the CEO title when Ellison resigned.<p>It looks like they, Catz and Hurd, will split the running of day to day operations as Hurd  gets sales, marketing and strategy reporting to him, while Catz will continue to have finance, legal and manufacturing.<p>Its down about a dollar after the close on about a third higher trading volume than normal.

YC looks for smart people with a history of building cool stuff. You probably have a better chance if your team has known each other and worked together on projects outside of school or work. If you can show examples where you can see and implement creative solutions to problems (hacking a non-computer system...), you have most of what it takes to be successful at YC, regardless of the startup idea you put on your application. It was possible at one point to apply with no idea at all, so that is some indication of the importance of everything else on the application.<p>PG said in a fireside chat once that the reason there was a 3 week gap between invitation and interview was twofold: to allow people enough time to get cheap airfare, and to see what progress they make on the idea. 3 weeks, he said, is enough time to build a rough prototype (software, at least) and start getting traction of some kind.",1411071221

Even if one has a prototype, the companies they work for have strict policies that prevent doing business on the side, let alone the fact that the H1 visa also explicitly prevents you from having any other source of income or starting a corp. The only options would be to go all in and go to their home country to develop the product further, at which point they&#x27;ve abandoned everything they&#x27;ve worked hard for all this while, - or - wait for a green card, which is elusive if you are from one of the populous Asian countries.\nWhat other options does one have?

Could they describe their experience?<p>Also, please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here, but despite assurances from YC folk and Sam himself that you can and should apply even if you have just an idea or prototype, blog after blog suggest you need to be much further than that to get through the tough competition.",1411071198

Some of the things that rubyists accept in Rails they would never put in an application or library because it is deemed okay only by massively adopted convention at the framework level, but not generally a good practice.<p>Then you have libraries like rspec which started out being full of magic but which gradually got refined and cleaned up so that in rspec 3.0 you have zero monkey patches; it&#x27;s just pure ruby, providing a totally modular set of DSLs that work together nicely and allow for amazingly readable test output.",1411070634

8337284,comment,8335570,8335570,4,0,abalone,,,"Here&#x27;s the thing that&#x27;s left out of this investor-friendly analysis, and why Suster is wrong about the &quot;irrationality&quot; of no-cap deals: For smaller angels, <i>access to the deal</i> itself is valuable.<p>Small investors don&#x27;t have access to Series A. That&#x27;s why the analogy with the stock market is broken:<p><i>&quot;Can you imagine investing in the stock market where your price was determined at a future date and the better that company performed the HIGHER the price you paid for that investment.&quot;</i><p>The reality is angels don&#x27;t have the option of purchasing the stock after the seed round. So, it can make perfect economic sense for an angel to pay a premium to get access to a deal. And if that premium comes in the form of pre-paying for a chunk of the Series A (one way to look at a no-cap deal), that can make sense -- perhaps even more sense that an enhanced seed valuation would. A discount would be sweetener on top of that. But to be clear: there is a rational case for smaller investors taking no-cap deals in order to get a chunk of the next Facebook, which they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be able to get.<p>Seed rounds present a unique intersection point for founders & smaller angels where their interests overlap. I think the bigger-sized investor community are somewhat threatened by that, and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re seeing such a sophisticated campaign against no-cap convertible notes. But the climate is now competitive enough and small-angel platforms are getting enough traction that you can sense their anxiety that no-caps may be coming back, to the great benefit of founders.",1411070452

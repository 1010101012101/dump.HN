You say that it isn't a cultural problem, but then describe how what I would call cultural problems ! I agree with the gist of your post though - and yes, choosing appropriate technology would help, a lot, but it is a cultural problem preventing it ! (culture of management perhaps?).",1262757404

1034240,comment,1034184,1034184,0,0,Zev,,,"This article seems like a mishmash of a dozen different points in an attempt to get hits. However one line that stood out to me is:<p><i>The iPhone, however, is a relative wasteland for open source.</i><p>Hardly true. The best bits of open source projects for the iPhone are frameworks and tools under a BSD license, rather then full applications under something like GPL. It feels somewhat like the author is complaining that he can't always get high quality software for free, not that software isn't open source.<p>There's stuff like TouchJSON (or json-framework) or Three20 happen to be used in <i>a lot</i> of different applications. Theres also lesser used (but still incredibly useful) open source projects like Mover (transfer files between iPhones/iPods) or Flow Cover (OpenGL CoverFlow implementation).<p>If you want to make a game? You're in luck. There's OpenFeint (social platform of sorts), game engines like SIO2  (3D), Cocos2d (2D), OC3D (3D, based on Cocos2d), the engine behind Wolfenstien (it <i>is</i> open source!) and so on that are immensely helpful if they're what you're looking for.<p>And theres frameworks like MGTwitterEngine, RegexKit(Lite) or ASIHTTPRequest (an ObjC REST library) that work on both Mac OS X and iPhone.",1262756225

Hit a truck at 35, while he is also doing 35, and you'll feel a 70mph effect all right. For a few milliseconds.<p>Unfortunately, poles, especially old ones, do not have as much give as one would like, and large trees have basically none. Plus, their narrow aspect is a very bad thing to hit; cars are designed to collide with large, flat, wide objects and to crumple accordingly to wash off energy. Hitting an immoveable narrow object is outside this design consideration and cars have a nasty tendency to wrap around it.",1262755951

Without the context of the size of the plots, this is relatively useless (if they are huge, they're about exactly the same, if one is small then the other is massively bigger).  If we say plot B is 1 log unit larger than plot A then it is twice (if base 2) bigger than plot A, no extra context required.<p>I thought it was cool...",1262755640

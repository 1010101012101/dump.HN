3926519,comment,3926265,3926265,2,0,AsylumWarden,,,"Living in the LA area I really struggle with the issue of being in introvert in a society that almost demands a person be an extrovert. Job searching was horrendous because I wasn't interested in being a ""drinking buddy"". I would gladly hangout for a short while but I'm just not that social in a group of 4 or more. Sometimes 2 or 3 is pushing it for me when they are very lively. At work I've literally had managers ask me if I'm mentally ill or something.  I even got kicked off of a project because the manager couldn't understand why I didn't want to hang out, talk sports, or for that matter just jockey for a lead roll on the project. It just isn't me. I did happily work in the background putting out fires left & right and solving numerous complex problems but because I don't like to bring attention to myself no one noticed until I wasn't part of the project anymore. Pretty sad really; for me and them I guess. I work under a much better manager in the same company now. He is still an extrovert but I think he understands how I function which is a nice plus.  I get a little more leeway to do genuine research for problems which only benefits the company so far.",1336092981

3926491,comment,3924657,3925164,0,0,sassafras,,,"I can't speak for the parent, but my take on it is that Ruby is considerably slower than Objective-C and one of the slower scripting languages in common use, IIRC.  I wouldn't go out on a limb and suggest that it's unsuitable for iOS development without having a chance to see it myself, but it's something to keep in mind.<p>As I'm sure you've seen, even Objective-C is too slow for many things when developing for iOS - for instance, if you want to get halfway decent UITableView performance it's best to write a custom UIView where instead of laying out nested subviews, you drop into C and do all your layout in drawRect using only CoreGraphics API calls.<p>If you're attempting to do anything more complicated than hooking together pre-fab components, your performance is probably going to suck if your views are written in Ruby.  And it's the silky smooth graphics people have come to expect that give iOS the reputation it's earned for slick UI.<p>It doesn't mean you shouldn't necessarily use a framework like this, but you don't get all that convenience for free.  I've often felt that the reason Objective-C remains in use (aside from the fact that it's kept alive by Apple) is that it sits in a really practical middle ground between the bare metal performance of C and the convenience (and tradeoffs) of ""nicer"" languages.  As I said above, though, this is just my default reaction, and I'd love to see this stuff in action if it's truly usable for a reasonable subset of use cases.",1336092386

3926468,comment,3923204,3923204,17,0,breckinloggins,,,"The actual ruling[1] has some interesting stuff besides what is covered in the article summary:<p>- Discussion about a time when it WAS possible to associate an IP address with a specific device and that, for the purposes of allowing discovery, it was REASONABLE to assume that the traffic from that device was initiated by the owner of that device.  This has important implications for the future, as IPv6 may make ""one ISP IP per actual end device"" common again<p>- Some hilarious footnotes describing the hypocritical nature of the claims of this and plaintiffs in previous cases.  In one case, a plaintiff made a claim that part of the reason for vigorous copyright claims was to ""protect minors"", when the very plaintiff had a teen porn website.  Another footnote was about this plaintiff (K-beech) attempting to claim the moral high ground when in fact the person behind the company was the same who previously tried to extort adult book store owners with violence and bomb threats.<p>- A VERY interesting footnote which points out that it is still somewhat of an open question whether pornographic works are copyrightable at ALL<p>- The fact that, in the case of pornography, plaintiffs often rely on defendants settling even though they are innocent, simply because they don't want their name published in association with a video called ""My Little Panties #2""<p>- Abusive tactics by the plaintiff to use information provided by discovery to harass defendants to settle.  This includes asking for phone numbers and email addresses which, the judge observes, aren't necessary for servicing defendants and are mostly used to further the plaintiff's aggressive settlement tactics<p>- The hilarity of seeing things like ""Maryjane Young Love\nand\nGangbanged"" in an official court filing<p>- And a whole section that's arguable more important than the IP address opinion...<p>Plaintiffs in these cases usually file a joinder[2] of claims and combine 10s, 100s, and sometimes 1000s of defendants in a single suit.  However, the judge argues that even if he were to grant discovery on all the John Does in the case, he still might sever the joinder because:<p>- It is transparently an attempt to avoid paying the ~$350 filing fee for each claim.  The courts, he says, don't take kindly on losing that much revenue simply because the fees don't fit the plaintiff's business model<p>- Joinder rules require, among other things, that the group of defendants must be related by the action arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and any\nquestion of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action..  In a wonderful display of deeply understanding the technical matters here, the judge argues that the technical nature of BitTorrent (to wit: that multiple parties seed the same file at the same time) does not alone satisfy the joinder requirement, simply because the user is not usually aware of these technical details.<p>- That, in any event, these co-defendants are only related by technical protocol and not case fact.  Because of this, each defendant would still get to retain counsel, call witnesses, and defend him- or herself separately.  In addition, the rules of joinder require certain actions that would involve n*(n-1) separate filings and would complicate the discovery process.  This, the judge points out, turns an otherwise simple case into a massively complex one and thereby goes against the very reason why joinder was created in the first place.<p>In my opinion, this has the potential to be an even bigger setback to the copyright owners' tactics than the IP address opinion.  If joinders like these are routinely severed because of these reasons, it would certainly make the ""mass lawsuits against thousands of unnamed defendants"" tactic a losing business model.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/92215098"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/92215098</a> [scribd fullscreen]<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joinder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joinder</a>",1336091756

Of course, if you did stay with the company forever then vacation is ""free"" time, but it could also be considered an investment as it usually scales to salary at time of departure.<p>With this mindset, unpaid time off is the same thing as vacation, you're just moving the cost to the next paycheck instead of your last paycheck.<p>Just take some unpaid time off.  If you are valuable and productive it probably won't make a difference to the company and it might even make you more productive in the long run.<p>Anyone have a counter argument to this?

3926446,comment,3925883,3926144,2,0,dpark,,,"This is similar to the problem with deletion in a standard linked list. Destructive actions can invalidate existing pointers.<p>One fix for this issue would be to extract the node where you split and ""freeze"" it. i.e. If you split at element 10, that element gets shoved into a new node which holds only one element and pointers are adjusted as necessary. The node it's extracted from may also be split into two pieces if necessary.  From this point on, the single-element node is never merged into another node. It always exists independently.<p>Merging in this world works basically like it does in a normal linked list. You rearrange pointers but don't combine nodes. Insertion works like it does for a typical unrolled linked list, but with the frozen nodes special cased.<p>The tricky bit is if you're saving a lot of pointers that aren't part of a split operation. Then you might need to explicitly expose the freeze operation. And if you use it on every node, you're back to a standard linked list (with a bigger constant factor). You could also expose unfreeze, but that could get buggy really quickly. You could do a ref-counted freeze/unfreeze, but you should probably quit before you get to that point.",1336091093

The traceroute utility on unix and windows can be used to show you the path from your local network to a particular network, simply by traceroute'ing address that you know are operated by a particular network.<p>The way this works is a series of routing protocols that ask the question, ""Which network routes this address and what is the best path to get there?"" and answer it in various ways.<p>So, I do not think it is possible or desirable for a single publicly route-able IPv6 address to follow a particular device between networks.<p>Finally, I would like to point out that, even though we can change them, MAC addresses are supposed to be the permanent unique identifier for a particular network interface.

So I would definitely welcome better text editing features on iOS even if it's not the best tool for the job. It's funny because I originally thought the text input via touch would be the biggest problem but I'm now crazy fast with it. It's the editing that really slows me down.",1336089706

Other important bits:<p>* Improved iPhone 4 baseband hardware performs significantly better than iPhone 3GS in areas with very low dBm. The 3GS dropped or failed to place calls at -113dBm, whereas iPhone 4 works fine. Quote: “There's no doubt in my mind this iPhone gets the best cellular reception yet, even though measured signal is lower than the 3GS.”<p>* Signal quality should be measured in terms of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), which “is essentially a measure of how much of the signal is compromised by noise or interference” instead of dBm, which is merely a measure of power. This distinction is important because, since “the iPhone 4 works almost perfectly fine at -113 dBm, it has much better sensitivity.”<p>* “The drop in signal from holding the phone with your left hand arguably remains a problem. Changing the bars visualization may indeed help mask it, and to be fair the phone works fine all the way down to -113 dBm, but it will persist - software updates can change physics as much as they can change hardware design. At the end of the day, Apple should add an insulative coating to the stainless steel band, or subsidize bumper cases. It's that simple.”",1277970643

I would be annoyed if someone wrote the first loop in java, instead of using a for-each loop.<p>I just have some patterns differntly.

I think Scandinavia definitely wins on the lower-class end: a 25th-percentile-income family in Denmark, is probably much better off than a 25th-percentile-income family in the US. I'm not sure what the comparison would come out as at the 50th percentile. It might depend on where exactly in Scandinavia and the U.S. you are, and answers to some lifestyle-preference questions (for example, do you actively prefer having a car, or do you actively prefer being able to get away without having a car?).

(News outlets that seem partial lose prestige, and hence compete in a different niche--contrast the New York Times and the New York Post.) Who must they appear impartial to? Their audience, of course--and the primary audience for American newspapers is Americans. Now, when the American executive branch and one out of two political parties seriously claims that waterboarding is not torture, you suddenly seem partial to Americans if you openly contradict that claim, because the question of whether waterboarding is torture has moved from accepted wisdom to controversy. Clouding all of this, of course, is that the controversy itself is nothing more than a semantic argument. Another contributing factor is ignorance--waterboarding went from an obscure torture technique which comparatively few people knew about to an active political issue, which means a lot of people who knew absolutely nothing about waterboarding until the administration said ""we're for it and we're doing it"" made up their minds at that instant, based on their opinion of the administration.<p>Weaker forms of this are seen when, for instance, news outlets give equal time to cranks when reporting on science, because there's ""controversy"" over whether evolution is real or whether the earth is really 4 billion years old.

But computers are evolving in a direction that makes coding knowledge less useful - shell scripting is irrelevant in a world full of iPads.  In that future, the only people who need <i>any</i> coding knowledge would be the folks who write the software for the iPads and such, but the idea of teaching everyone BASIC in middle school just to introduce them to programming (like I was) would be pretty quaint.<p>I don't like that future, and I don't know how we'd get kids interested in programming in that future.

2211364,comment,2210469,2211275,0,0,billmcneale,,,"> I disagree. The relevant question is whether the benefit to society is greater or lesser than it could be from other laws. If someone is sued for a few million dollars from a patent troll who does nothing else for society with that patent, net loss. When something is brought to market that wouldn't have been without protection, net gain.
Patent laws at least in the software arena are very plausibly a net loss<p>How do you come to this conclusion?<p>As I showed, there is plenty of software innovation happening in the US every day. Occasionally, the process goes awry and we see futile lawsuits, but the ""net positive"", as you put it, is undoubtedly positive if America's leadership in software innovation is any indication.<p>Speaking of frivolous patent lawsuits, we do hear about some now and then, but when was last time that something truly outrageous was awarded to a patent troll? Outrageous patents get filed on a daily basis but they hardly ever survive in court, or they are resolved outside the courts in a settlement, usually indicating that both parties have ""dirt"" on each other and chose to settle instead of engaging in something that will end up as mutually assured destruction.<p>By all criteria, the system is working pretty well.<p>Having said that, I think the duration of software patents should be reduced.",1297550506

Maybe we are, maybe we're not; correlations alone tell us nothing about it.<p>The analogy with physics, be it temperature or pressure or what have you, is in my opinion quite flawed, because in the case of those entities we know that the elementary events / forces are linked by way of causality with the macro factor, and we know that <i>for reasons other than mere correlation</i>.<p>In the case of g, on the contrary, <i>the only link between the different elements is the correlation itself</i>. And it gets worse: to be included as a relevant IQ test, a new test has to be correlated with g. To quote from the article:<p>""<i>By this point, I'd guess it's impossible for something to become accepted as an ""intelligence test"" if it doesn't correlate well with the Weschler and its kin, no matter how much intelligence, in the ordinary sense, it requires. (...) This is circular and self-confirming, and the real surprise is that it doesn't work better.</i>""<p>So g is at the same time what we're looking for and what we're building upon, having decided it's there already.<p>This looks much more like religion than science.",1297549547

We also had to externalize some work that I and her where doing, we hire someone for lawn service, we have a girl come and help with cleaning and we now employ a mechanic when we have car troubles. We home-school so that creates more demand on our time to be parents. I would say it was tough for both of us to adjust but probably more so for me. I grew up on an farm where from the time we woke up to the time dinner was served we worked and fixed our own issues. It was a perfect example of self reliance. My grandfather (grandparents raised me) was also an aircraft mechanic in the Air Force, so we fixed all car / truck / tractor issues ourselves. Anyways, long story short it was very tough for a person of that upbringing to adapt to hiring people to deal with personal life based work.<p>I read a good article once that convinced me to try it and it could be summed up as, if the job is not a specialty job (e.g electrician) and it cost more to hire someone than your hourly rate then do it yourself. If not you should be hiring someone and applying those hours to your business or project or personal life hours. This rule of thumb has worked well for me after I let go of past upbringing and applied it. It was hard for me to let go of vehicle repairs due to the cost of repairs but when factored out it is more cost effective to have the shop do it and apply those hours to my firm or enjoy time with the kids.<p>In a nutshell the trick is to delegate work to third parties, household work is usually the cheapest work to do so with, this will free up more hours for work life balance and more hours to commit to projects / consultancy.",1297548674

2211251,comment,2210469,2211170,0,0,nostrademons,,,"China is actually a very good example, you're just looking at the wrong industry.<p>Both America and China industrialized by misappropriating trade secrets from the reigning technical powers of the time (Britain and America, respectively) and then bringing that knowledge home where it could be employed by workers who were willing to work for less.  The birthplace of the American industrial revolution are the textile mills at Waltham and later Lowell, MA.  Francis Cabot Lowell spent 2 years memorizing how British power mills worked, and then came back to America with all that knowledge in his head.  He then copied the design of that mill on the banks of the Charles River, and American industry was born.<p>China's manufacturing similarly depends upon transfer of knowledge from developed to developing nations, though in this case the transfer is largely voluntary, with American firms setting up factories in China.  However, people then leave those factories and set up their own firms, using the trade secrets they gained while working at foreign multinationals.  Software is the wrong industry to look at - think in terms of textiles or cars.",1297548635

Amazon can sell eBooks from their website to be opened in the Kindle app, just as long as you don't select the product inside the Kindle app. They could allow Amazon to use Apple's payment gateway free of charge, but why bother?<p>It's a simple separation of concerns: if you're going to initiate inapp purchases that are completed in Safari, then to prove trustworthiness you need to offer purchases via Apple in parallel; if you're going to avoid Apple then you lose the privilege of making the purchase seem sanctioned by the iOS ecosystem.<p>How big is 30% of Amazon's ebook sales to iDevices really? I'm betting <i>less</i> than what Amazon's presence means as a boost to Apple unit sales. The parallel purchase option is really a sign of <i>more</i> flexibility from Apple.",1297548405

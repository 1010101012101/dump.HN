To accomplish this today  you'd need to follow a strict template on your actual cronjobs.  Stuff like: what host am I on, what crontab am I being run out of, what user am I running as, what script(s) / program(s) am I invoking.<p>nfs: performance, reliability, security, arbitrary group limits.<p>Generally: performance monitoring. We're still relying on top, uptime, vmstat, iostat, strace, ltrace, (sometimes systemtap/dtrace), wireshark, netstat, lsof, and related tools. There are a few new tricks coming out, and some ways to integrate data from multiple sources, but often tuning systems (especially where VMs or application engines are concerned) resembles a seance / archaeological dig / bro knowledge / myth / wishful thinking / Republican plank.  For the love of Dennis, it's been 40 years, give me some goddamned insights.<p>There are probably a bunch of others, though I'm trying to stick with basics that you might find in <i>The UNIX Programming Environment</i> or similar -- really foundational basics (or reasonable extensions of same).<p>The barrier to change is that most of this stuff works well enough most of the time, and too much depends on it.  I'm seeing a lot of exploration of alternatives around some core systems though, and suspect we'll see significant changes in the next 5-10 years. Possibly even sooner, though history suggests slower adoption.",1321999157

Use Ada if you need that.<p>But if you want you can also encode the sizes in binary or decimal numbers:

3267574,comment,3264849,3267310,2,0,Periodic,,,"This makes sense. You're totally right about the database.  I've run into that issue before, but I had forgotten.<p>Your example is similar to the approach that Yesod, a Haskell web-framework, takes.  The templating language, Hamlet, will accept many types, such as Text or String, but ultimately everything gets translated into RepHTML before being rendered to a real HTML string that is sent to the client.  Whenever you give the template a value it automatically runs the appropriate conversion function based on type to generate something safe for display on the page.<p>The only way to get from a String to RepHTML is either to use the proper escaping function (usually done automatically) or use a special function to do an unsafe conversion, forcing you to explicitly state that a conversion is safe.<p>The type system is one of the tools used to guarantee that these things get sanitized.  You can generate RepHTML in other places, such as through a widget, or other helper functions, and it knows at that point that you properly escaped it.  Without the type system you could run into issues when a function generates HTML (sanitized) and then the final template re-sanitizes it.  It would be very awkward to do things like layout templates if things are getting sanitized many times.",1321999095

Define your morality explain why addiction to drugs does not meet your criteria for immorality.<p>For example, I'd argue thusly: ""I believe an action is only immoral if it harms another person against their will.

There are effective, evidence based, talking therapies.

In the UK front line treatment for mild to moderate depression is not medication, but is CBT.

Right now, the user has no idea what's happening (has my click being taken into account? What's happening? Who knows?) - say right there, I'm on Willy Wonka, clicked Ravenclaw, and nothing happens at all. So I reclick. Nothing happens.

Even constructing a system with simple one-way hashes might be sufficient.<p>If the logging system is based on a hash of the current and prior records, you get chaining and integrity validation <i>prior to the attack</i> (one problem of attacks is wiping out immediate or all prior history). If you've got remote storage / logging, particularly on multiple systems with independent trust models (compromising system A doesn't necessitate compromise of B and/or C), you're in better shape still.<p>A signature which required periodic updating of a key from a key provider via a mechanism that prevents later key reuse would mean that past records couldn't be fabricated or modified after the fact. This might require passing data through two or more systems to accomplish the signing in a trusted fashion (not particularly amenable to high-rate logging).<p>The verification key need not be on the logging system at all (and ideally wouldn't be). You'd access and verify logs from a standalone hardened and highly trusted system (say: booted from known good static media).<p>Much of which is good for the extreme case, but as I note in my other comments, isn't particularly practical for day-to-day needs.

3267514,comment,3267187,3267187,24,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"This is a very excellent list, and reads almost exactly how I've documented my personal standards and best practices. There are a few things that I feel are left out, and should definitely be just as important:<p>1. Testing. Having automated tests that your developers are ideally writing first makes a world of difference. Throw it into your continuous integration system, and nurture a culture around it. If your tools and language allow it, having a lint or style checker as part of your build process is also very handy.<p>2. Development / Debug Mode. There should be a switch that you can flip when working from localhost, development, and staging to immediately obtain tons of data to aid you in debugging your application. Django-Debug-Toolbar is the holy grail when it comes to using an out of the box solution. Seeing breakdowns of queries called, time spent doing various functions, quick log lookups, etc is essential.<p>3. Production Error Tracking. If you're still relying on grep'ing logs or being sent 5xx error emails as your only form of error control you're in the stone ages. Go use a tool or service like Sentry to turn this into a centralized system.<p>4. Issue Tracking. Along the same lines as version control, this should be a no-brainer. A centralized resource for keeping track of any formalized bugs, errors, or planning future features.<p>5. Analytics and Statistics. Can you tell me right now the delta of 4xx and 5xx errors in your application between your two most recent deploys? How healthy is your app over time? How many sign-ups, returning users, login failures, and purchases have been made? Tracking key business metrics and actionable events will really give you fantastic insight into your product. It's also a great way to catch critical system errors before they take down your site for hours on end, via tracked spikes in latency, cache misses, queue size, etc.",1321998233

The code in that repository is an older version of what LibLime's LK customers are running (4.2 versus 4.6 or 4.8).  LK is, to the best of my knowledge, the extension of Harley, a Koha fork put out by PTFS several years ago.  obelos: is the new version you're releasing next week 4.4, or something later?<p>There is also the close-source product, LibLime Enterprise Koha (LLEK), which I believe may have been rebranded as ""LibLime Academic Koha"".

In fact, it came off to me as if you were minimizing the seriousness of depression in general. I could have just taken it that way without you meaning it like that.<p>Your comment about pills also came off as if to say its not a valid solution. Like maybe pills are somehow for the weak or lazy.<p>Honestly, I just really detected a lot of snark in that comment and in this one and I don't know why. You just called my participation in CBT ""an enjoyable hobby"" like a backhanded compliment. I wouldn't call it a hobby at all.<p>Maybe if you want to get technical and argue semantics a moral failing and disease may not be mutually exclusive. But we're talking about the real world. As it applies to depression and addiction, disease and moral failing <i>are</i> mutually exclusive. People are looked down upon and carry a stigma because so many people want to call it a moral failing. They say ""just snap out of it"" for depression and they call addicts weak people when the reality is so far from being so black and white.<p>Everyone can pull out studies to discredit the other guy's study that he pulled out. Let's be real when we talk about this stuff and not hide behind studies. Researchers disagree all the time so the best we can do is use our own experience, best judgement, and widely accepted truths to argue our points.<p>At the end of the day I took less issue with your facts than your ton. It just sounded demeaning and like you were minimizing the seriousness of this stuff. Plus there was a bit of snark detected. I don't think I was the only one either.

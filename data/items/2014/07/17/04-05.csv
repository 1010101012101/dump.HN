Many other comments in this thread have addressed this.<p><i>> In this case, it is the accelerated frame of reference in which time &quot;slows down&quot; relative to the non-accelerated frame.</i><p>Not really. The key difference is not acceleration; it&#x27;s the fact that the super space ship is in motion relative to the center of mass of the galaxy, while the Earth is not. (Strictly speaking, the Earth is too, but its motion with respect to the galaxy&#x27;s center of mass is so slow that it can be ignored in this scenario.) Similarly, if I sit at rest on the Earth&#x27;s equator and you move westward around the equator at the same speed as the Earth is rotating (about 450 meters per second), then when we meet up again, <i>my</i> clock will have less elapsed time than yours, because you will have been at rest with respect to the Earth&#x27;s center of mass, not me (because I am rotating with the Earth, but you are not).",1405573172

Is the dryer that has essentially an Android tablet embedded in it superior to the two knobs and a button my current one has? (And of that, I use 10% of my options.) Do I need yet finer control? I only have so much attention to give; <i>no</i> interface is more appealing to me. An appliance can be &quot;smart&quot; without having the trappings of computers, I hope.<p>And likewise, do we need an Internet connection in order for the object to be smart? If context awareness is the name of the game, there&#x27;s quite a bit you can glean by being a physical object with a memory of how it&#x27;s used, and beyond that, a local network.<p>The Drift lightbulb is interesting because it adds some smarts to a dumb object but doesn&#x27;t add more I/O - it still uses a light switch and an LED bulb, and it isn&#x27;t trying to get on the network. There are computers that are taking on the form factor of a light bulb, and there are light bulbs that are taking on the force multiplier of a computing device. The latter philosophy needs to be explored more.",1405572997

You&#x27;ll be sorry if you scrimp on this piece of equipment.<p>You&#x27;ll also need a sheet feeding scanner with a hopper on it, that&#x27;ll scan both sides at the same time. Otherwise, it takes far too long. The software with the scanner will OCR it automagically and create a PDF. I scan at 400 dpi, which looks real sweet on a retina screen. There are a lot of settings to tweak on the scanner, some experimenting will get you the best results. Make sure you turn the double feed detection on.<p>Use some denatured alcohol to regularly clean the window and rollers, I also use a solder sucker to blow the paper dust out of it.<p>And lastly, you&#x27;ll never get 100% of a book to go through cleanly. Just rescan the screw-ups, and assemble the result using pdftk (a marvelous tool).

8046067,comment,8040109,8042973,4,0,jblow,,,"I certainly welcome the attempts to reduce annotations and will look again at the language in a while.<p>It is interesting that the design priorities are so library-centric. I agree that library quality is important, but think about this: For every library that someone writes, N people are going to use that library in leaf programs, where if the library is useful N is much much greater than 1. So by definition the vast majority of code is not library code.<p>In video games we write programs that are between 200k and 2M lines, say. That is big enough that you do want to think about what API you are presenting from part of that program to another, but stability of that (internal) API is almost never a concern, and in fact this is one of the big boons of statically-typed languages: you can change a function and you instantly get errors at all the calling sites, allowing you to be sure you updated them (except in some bad ambiguous situations).<p>This fluid ability to change how parts of your program talk to each other is very important in large programs. It is one of the major ways you avoid code rot. The more friction is introduced into this process, the lower the ceiling on how large and complex a program you can build.<p>The other thing about games is that the problems are inherently very interconnected. Yes, we kind of partition things into different modules, but these modules all want to talk to each other very heavily (partly for inherent problem space reasons, partly for performance reasons). So again, friction introduced here hurts us more than it hurts most people.<p>I understand that private-by-default seems like the right idea because it supports a certain paradigm of programming that is generally considered the right thing (encapsulate your implementation details, modularize as much as possible, etc). But what I have found, in my field at least, is that this is less true than many people think. Yes, it&#x27;s important to keep things clean, but fluid ability to change code is very important, and overmodularization hurts this. I think that some day this will become more widely understood, the same way that today most good programmers understand that OOP is not some kind of One True Panacea the way folks in the 90s seemed to think.<p>Good ideas can be carried too far and I think for my field private-by-default is way too far. Having to put &#x27;pub&#x27; on every member of every struct and on well more than half my functions is kind of bananas.<p>(As someone who does not buy into the paradigm of OOP, I want to write functions that operate on data. In C++ sometimes I encapsulate these functions as struct members but this is just an aid to understanding when it is convenient; most functions are declared at file scope. In order to have a functions-operating-on-data mentality in Rust, I guess I need to put a pub in front of every member of every struct, which feels very distasteful; it feels like the language is pushing me toward paradigms that many in my field have tried and subsequently rejected after decades of pain.)<p>Well, this certainly went a few places, but that is where I am on these issues.",1405571882

8046016,comment,8045428,8045428,40,0,PaulMest,,,"Context: I was at Microsoft during the first and only round of layoffs in company history (2009). My job was not impacted at all by the layoffs so I speaking from my memory of what was happening around me. In fact, I was working on an incubation project that was one of the few ideas that was green-lighted with a pretty sizable team that year.<p>My perspective:\nFrom a company perspective, eliminating 5000 people in 2009 was a great idea. It was (and is) a huge company so it probably could have been more. However, the layoffs in 2009 were seriously botched. Many organizational best practices were violated.<p>Microsoft made an announcement saying that there would be ~5000 layoffs and that they would be completed over the following 18 months. This timeframe is too long! Layoff best practices say: cut deep and cut fast. Get rid of the people that have to be let go, treat them as well as you can on the way out, and then show some serious TLC to the employees you want to retain and rebuild your culture and trust with the people who stick around. Don&#x27;t let the entire company live in fear for 18 months!<p>As much as the stack rank was a thing at Microsoft in those days, even if you were the lowest ranked employees for 2 years, Microsoft was hard-pressed to actually fire anybody.  Even during this time of layoffs, Microsoft decided to divest in many businesses/products and chose not to eliminate people based on performance.<p>For example, they shipped one last version of MS Money and then the whole team was RIF-ed.  Everybody on that team would get ~2 months to interview and find other jobs in the company otherwise they got a generous severance package and were no longer employed.  Combine this with the fact that many Microsoft teams had recently restricted their headcount, it was relatively more difficult than it ever had been to find a job within the company.<p>The divesting strategy was interesting and it probably would have been a good way to do massive position elimination except that not all final versions of products were aligned to ship in the same timeframe. So anybody working on small-ish or lame-ish products had a fear for many many months that after shipping their current product, they would be out of a job.  IIRC, this strategy of divesting took about ~12 months instead of the 18 months they originally announced before they provided comfort to the employees that the layoffs had completed.<p>This was also during the economic downturn of 2008 so there was extra angst from people who lost their job because they had just lost a lot of their net worth from a seriously depressed market.  Morale suffered. Lots of good people defected to Amazon, Facebook, Google.<p>This time around, I hope Microsoft does a better job of keeping the timeframe for cutting to a reasonable period of time like 1-2 months. Unfortunately, even if you make it through the layoffs and feel secure that you have SOME JOB, you&#x27;ll probably not really know WHAT SPECIFICALLY you&#x27;re working on until all of the re-orgs play out. This is colloquially known as re-org hell.<p>Best of luck to the people impacted. It&#x27;s a relatively better market this time around. If any of you make it to San Francisco, I&#x27;m happy to grab coffee or give you pointers on some cool companies looking for great people.",1405570269

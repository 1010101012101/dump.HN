Bitcoin partisans believe the former, I believe the latter.<p>And what about the labor which went into designing and coding the bitcoin software, the exchanges, and so forth? Do you think all that labor was worthless (we don&#x27;t even have to include the &quot;mining&quot; capital and labor in this judgement)? Well, then the value of labor is apparently just as subjective as the value of commodities. So I don&#x27;t follow how a premise involving STV vs LTV can be used to make a logical argument about the value of bitcoin, or any software for that matter.",1377140376

Inevitably, we will find the problems with hedonism and need a (second) revolution. I&#x27;m not arguing that we live in the &quot;perfect capitalistic society&quot;far from it. However, we can&#x27;t fight fire with fire here, i.e., we cannot replace one broken system with another inherently broken system. Instead, we need to change people&#x27;s ideas about life, money, and happiness. It&#x27;s only when we change <i>focus</i> that balance will be achievable. Money, happiness, work are all amoral. Undue focus on money or happiness or work tends to bring about moral failure. So, we now know what it&#x27;s like to live in a society that focuses on money (capitalistic). If we follow Jan we will know what it&#x27;s like to live in a (more so) hedonistic society.<p>Instead of jumping from one school of thought to another, I think we really just want to find balance and purpose.

Wyden and Udall release a statement saying something like: &quot;This is only the tip of the iceberg: if Americans only knew how bad it was, they&#x27;d be very angry.&quot;  They&#x27;re on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and so are in a position to know at least more than their colleagues, and much more than their employers (the American people).  This is extremely disconcerting.  What we know and now see confirmed officially about the surveillance is pretty stunning.  Exactly how bad is this?  Is all of congress tapped?  All the governors?  Snowden hinted at this.  What the fuck is going on in my country?<p>2.  So, if it&#x27;s so bad, why won&#x27;t the honorable Sens. Udall and Wyden take a stand and reveal the wrongdoings on the Senate floor?  As I understand the law, they cannot be charged for anything revealed on the Senate floor.  And even if there were a way to charge them, I&#x27;d like to think it would be political suicide for any president to try.<p>These two gentleman swore an oath to the U.S. constitution.  Why won&#x27;t they uphold it?  They are in a unique position to do so.

In addition to access to new channels, it also provides the benefit of being able to watch regular broadcast channels even when you couldn&#x27;t receive them over the air.

This also helps as M-E-A-N are very independent by design and can be used independently. In fact, we are currently using AngularJS at frontend and PHP at backend.<p>MongoDB: is a NoSQL database designed for handling huge amounts of non-relational data. In comparison, MySQL excels at handling relational data but does not scale as well. If you need a lot of joins (relationships, user roles, etc.) then MySQL will be better and if you can benefit from the ability to keep arbitrary columns in your database tables without the need for running ALTER commands or other database hacks (CMS fits very well as most CMSs hack MySQL a lt to get the fleibility they need) then MongoDB will suit better.<p>ExpressJS: is akin to Django. While I am not experienced with ExpressJS, it seems more oriented towards single-page apps. Django has some good support for templating which comes in very handy for traditional websites. Single page apps don&#x27;t fetch a lot of HTML from backend anyway, so this capability is not of much use.<p>AngularJS: has no direct counterpart in LAMP stack with Django. Angular is a frontend framework used for building single page apps. In fact, if you are building a single page app, you would want to use a frontend framework like Angular or Ember even if you use Python/Django/MySQL at backend. As mentioned earlier, we have recently built a single page web app with Angular at frontend and LAMP(PHP) at backend.<p>Node.js: is actually (to some extent) a counterpart of apache server and not python or django. nodejs is a performance oriented server with asynchronism at its core. While it is definitely desirable for high workload applications, it does take some getting used to. For example, even though you I was quite comfortable with AJAX at frontend, writing database queries in an asynchronous mode felt quite unnatural at first.<p>Overall, depending on the kind of application to develop and the kind of time luxury to learn new things, you may want to adopt MEAN partially if not fully. If constraints permit, spending some time with M/E/A/N should be intellectually and professionally rewarding.",1403708045

But the many similarities between Aereo and cable companies, considered in light of Congress’ basic purposes in amending the Copyright Act, convince us that this difference is not critical here.&quot;<p>What this seems to leave open is the question of whether a company that was e.g. a generic cloud service with various features and functions, among them the ability to rent a mini-antenna and stream recorded data from it to your computer, would still be infringing. It suggests the infringement is largely due to the way Aereo positioned and marketed itself to customers - the common sense reality of the service overrode the technological loophole they attempted to exploit.",1403707164

But they&#x27;re not, and by design.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense for a law to be written such that receiving on one antenna and sending the result to your users is illegal, but receiving one an antenna farm all located in the same spot and sending the result to your users is legal.<p>Do we really want to live in a country where the obvious solution is illegal but an insane workaround is legal? I don&#x27;t want a precedent set where it becomes standard for laws to be bypassed with expensive and technically pointless workarounds. If we want to allow companies to receive TV broadcasts and stream them over the internet, we should do so. If we don&#x27;t, we shouldn&#x27;t. A situation where they&#x27;re only allowed to do it if they have 10,000 separate and unnecessary antennas is absurd.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s ridiculous that a TV station can broadcast their signal free of charge to anyone capable of receiving it, but if a company wants to receive it and then pass it along to somebody, they have to pay a fee.

This distinction was largely promoted by Karl Popper, a philosopher. And widespread adoption of falsifiability happened mostly in the 60s and 70s IIRC.<p>Prior to that point, theories were often accepted as true if they had a lot of explanatory power, in other words, if they seemed to explain a large set of observations. This made it very difficult to rigorously argue that, e.g., Astrology should not be considered scientific, because it seemed to have a lot of confirming evidence.<p>This is one of those things that seems really obvious in hindsight, but was a surprisingly big advance in how science was conducted in several fields. A more concrete example is how it affected social sciences like Psychology. Prior to Popper there were a lot of widely held theories that made no falsifiable predictions, today theories that seem to explain everything are generally seen as substantially less rigorous and scientific than ones that are falsifiable.",1403706986

Semantics define what the execution of that program would be.<p>For example, &#x27;X = X+1&#x27; can be valid by the syntax of two languages, except one of them (say Erlang), will fail to do the pattern matching defined under operator &#x27;=&#x27;, whereas the other will do an assignment where &#x27;X&#x27; is now worth its former value plus one.<p>There is a lot more meaning and deeper implications to defining what &#x27;x = x+1&#x27; means than defining how to write it. Another example can be &#x27;1 + 3 * 5&#x27;: this is an addition and a multiplication, but what&#x27;s the operator precedence? In smalltalk, it would be &#x27;(1 + 3) * 5&#x27;.

Popper literally argued that evidence cannot increase the probability a hypothesis is true–for example, collecting a sample of 1,000,000 crows and observing that all of them are black cannot increase your confidence in the belief &quot;at least 99% of crows are black.&quot; It can only decrease your confidence in opposing theories such as &quot;at least 99% of crows are white.&quot; Very few people would agree with that view today.<p>The general problem of whether we can increase the probability  that a theory is true by observing favorable evidence is the problem of induction, and there are no clear cut answers. A lot of philosophy focuses on situations like this: where all the proposed answers have flaws, but some have fewer flaws than others.<p>For example, one approach that&#x27;s been gaining popularity is Bayesianism. Bayesianism is the idea that we have some prior belief in the probability of a hypothesis, and that we can update our confidence in that hypothesis by observing evidence and comparing the relative probabilities that evidence would hold in worlds where the hypothesis was true vs. worlds where the hypothesis was false. The key weakness of Bayesianism is the question of where priors come from, and how to formulate good priors. This is a glaring weakness, but all proposed solutions have glaring weaknesses–that&#x27;s what makes Philosophy of Science hard.",1403705936

Still, I will try to be as neutral as possible.<p>> Bandit tests allow you to run as many variations at the same time as you want, versus A/B testing, which you limits to two.<p>True that the phrase <i>A/B Testing</i> in a strict sense considers only two variations, but almost all tools allow something called <i>A/B/n Testing</i> which allows for multiple variations. The mathematical foundations of A/B/n testing are as well established as that of A/B testing.<p>> But there&#x27;s a deeper, less obvious benefit. Had we run these social button variations as a series of A/B tests, we&#x27;d be at much greater risk of reaching a local maxima. That is, the odds of us missing the best performing variation in favor of one that&#x27;s merely adequate would be higher.<p>Again, there is another concept called <i>Multivariate Testing</i> to be used for testing multiple changes per page. MVT is also offered by many online A/B testing tools. Again,\nthe theoretical foundation is very well established.<p>> So I&#x27;d have to be on top of my game to make the code-changes as soon as the Chi Squared value was high enough.<p>Good A/B testing services do this automatically for you. Losing variations are automatically stopped and winning variations are automatically given 100% traffic. Of course, you have a choice to enable/disable this behavior.<p>> there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from tuning a bandit test to behave exactly like an A/B test.<p>Yes of course. Because multi-armed bandit (MAB) is <i>another strategy</i> of running A/B tests (more generally A/B/n tests, even more generally multivariate tests). So, technically, you can&#x27;t beat A/B tests with MAB as your article&#x27;s headline suggests, because MAB is itself a strategy of running A/B tests. What you can try to beat is <i>classical strategy</i> used by most tools today. Here, the post by VWO linked in your article clearly details the pros and cons of both approaches and establishes why a head to head comparison is, in fact, inappropriate.<p>> ...the critique is utterly ridiculous<p>As this point talks direct about VWO, I would take a break from my attempt at neutrality. <i>tuning a bandit test to behave exactly like an A/B test</i> was not the point of our article, and it is not the point of your article either. We have both attempted to compare the two approaches (MAB vs classical) to A/B testing. I do not mind your criticizing our article, but it would only be appropriate to substantiate your criticism with facts. Criticism without facts does not help the cause of discourse. I am fairly well versed with the theory of A/B testing and happy to take any questions here.",1403705029

You know throwing flash grenades in.<p>EDIT:<p>Case in point just this morning saw this article:<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/06/24/new-aclu-report-takes-a-snapshot-of-police-militarization-in-the-united-states"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/06/24/n...</a><p>* 62 percent of the SWAT raids surveyed were to conduct searches for drugs.<p>* Just under 80 percent were to serve a search warrant, meaning eight in 10 SWAT raids were not initiated to apprehend a school shooter, hostage taker, or escaped felon (the common justification for these tactics), but to investigate someone still only suspected of committing a crime.<p>* In fact, just 7 percent of SWAT raids were “for hostage, barricade, or active shooter scenarios.”<p>* In at least 36 percent of the SWAT raids studies, no contraband of any kind was found. The report notes that due to incomplete police reports on these raids this figure could be as high as 65 percent.\nSWAT tactics are disproportionately used on people of color.<p>* 65 percent of SWAT deployments resulted in some sort of forced entry into a private home, by way of a battering ram, boot, or some sort of explosive device. In over half those raids, the police failed to find any sort of weapon, the presence of which was cited as the reason for the violent tactics.<p>* Ironically (or perhaps not), searches to serve warrants on people suspected of drug crimes were more likely to result in forced entry than raids conducted for other purposes.<p>* Though often justified for rare incidents like school shootings or terrorist situations, the armored personnel vehicles police departments are getting from the Pentagon and through grants from the Department of Homeland Security are commonly used on drug raids.",1403704856

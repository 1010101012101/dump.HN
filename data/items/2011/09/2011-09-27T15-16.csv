3043836,comment,3043146,3043146,5,0,grandalf,,,"This is an extremely obvious point masquerading as something controversial.<p>In a market with 10 large financial firms, all of varying strength, a capital crisis may put a few of the weaker ones out of business, since a capital shortage means that a firm doesn't have enough liquid capital to cover its underwriting obligations and its cash flow needs. When this happens, weaker firms are hamstrung if they can't raise additional capital.  Typically the government provides free capital in the form of below market loans which can be turned into profitable short term loans at zero risk.<p>This means that the valuable assets will be gobbled up by the stronger firms and there will be less competition across the board.<p>Thus Goldman, as the strongest global financial firm, stands to gain the most from any crisis.<p>Regulators required all US financial firms to accept bailout assistance precisely to avoid what would have likely been the outcome of the crisis -- one or two super firms.<p>Even if all surviving firms shrunk by 80% post crisis, the resulting diminished competition would be a win for the surviving firms' investors.<p>It's debatable in the scenario of the 2008 crisis whether Goldman would have survived if AIG hadn't been bailed out. I think it likely would have, but it would have had to raise additional capital from investors... As it was Buffet invested around $5B (but could have easily invested much more -- and the yield would have been way better if more competitors had been allowed to fail).<p>As a result of this, and the various interests involved, much effort was expended to preserve the status quo.<p>One might ask what it would take for there to be legitimate competition in the financial services market...  My take is that policymakers' desire for cheap (below market price) credit can only be implemented through the sort of public/private partnership... aka socialized financial services like the ones we have in the US. To put it succinctly, <i>cheap credit is a right</i>.<p>It would be interesting to run an experiment to see how much this policy has impacted American democracy (for better and worse).  I don't think such an experiment would be possible though.",1317139061

Economists told us in 2006 that the market problems from Wall Street would spread into housing.<p>Again, there is a difference between stock analysts and economists. Economists are looking at numbers, trends and history more like a computer scientist. Economists are even often specialized into various regions of the country.<p>A stock analyst is going off of timing and trends more than data. If you've ever traded stocks heavily, you learn quickly that traders throw away yesterday...'that  money's gone'. Having worked to make companies profitable, it's unsettling to realize that the stock market is full of people who know how stocks work but have no idea how business works.<p>I think I've posted this before but in one past company we moved millions of dollars of product around before we did our annual inventory just so our numbers would match what Wall Street expected. We actually needed much more on hand than the stock market wanted just to do business, but they wouldn't have any idea about that.",1317139041

If we don't get some kind of industry consensus on this, we're looking at a future where those of us who want to use a Linux desktop[1] are going to have to do it on jailbroken hardware.  While the enthusiast motherboard community might be OK with some extra firmware settings and UIs, laptop vendors are simply never going to install and test extra junk that someone doesn't force them to.

3043768,comment,3043146,3043340,4,0,retube,,,"There's basically two ways:<p>1) You go short the underlying market(s), that is you sell them. Individuals don't (as far as I know) have access to the repo (repurchase) markets. What you do here is borrow a stock, sell it, then buy it back later to return to the guy you borrowed from. If the market has gone down you can buy it back for less than you sold it, hence making a profit.<p>The other way to short a market is a) sell calls or b) buy puts. These _are_ available to the individual. A put gives you the option to sell a stock at some predetermined price. If the stock falls below that price (the strike) then you can sell it at a price above the market. You prob don't want to sell a call as this gives you unlimited downside if teh market rallies :).<p>There are also more complex strategies such as call spreads, risk reversals etc which give you varying pay-off profiles.<p>2) You go long (buy) assets which are negatively correlated with the market you want to short. E.g if the eurozone implodes will see the following: dollar and yen will appreciate against the euro, treasuries will appreciate. Gold would normally appreciate as traditional safe haven but the outlook for this is way less certain: it's getting hammered at the moment, partly due to underlying global economic concerns (ie industrial demand for gold will drop) plus people are having to sell gold to meet margin calls on losses in equities. this has triggered further selling by the chinese who are long gold and getting squeezed. Also the swiss franc would normally be a safe haven, but the SNB is defending the level of the ccy at 1.2 vs the euro to protect swiss exports and tourism.<p>The problem is that the yen, dollar and treasuries aren't great places to park cash: safe yes, you won't lose anything but rates are so low you won't really earn anything either.",1317138340

I know very few people who think they'll have the same job five years from now. It seems very likely that the argument that the economy is getting more stable is false.<p>Here's why: underlying predictability probably increases volatily. People love to lever up when they're certain; ""Private Equity"" as an asset class refers to both VC deals and leveraged buyouts because in both cases, they fine-tune their leverage to get the same (high) volatility. Increased certainty makes bankers more willing to lend, and speculative buyers are always willing to borrow.<p>In my experience, speculative borrowers and the marginal banker overestimate decreases in volatility. Thus, a more superficially predictable economy will lever up fast enough to more than counteract that (sort of like the theory that airbags increase traffic fatalities because drivers overestimate how safe they are and thus take extra risks).<p>For economic volatility to actually dampen, you'd need economists to come up with better predictions that sound really stupid, so bankers and speculators would disregard them.",1317136498

That would allow a power user that wants to install an alternate OS to disable the feature and install anything they'd like.<p>I understand that this may affect dual-booting. In those cases, we already know that Windows 8 will boot in non-secure scenarios (like on existing computers, including those with UEFI firmware). So wouldn't it be possible to simply turn off the feature and still be able to dual-boot Windows 8 and another OS?",1317136126

I can see this go both ways. If most hardware manufacturers decide to only ship with MS keys, I think a judge could rule that Microsoft still has too much market power to let a free market optimize things for the good of the consumer. I do not see a judge decree that before there are any indications that it will become true, though.<p>(totally unrelated questions that I am curious about: how will this signing stuff work when running Windows in a VM? Would MS dare charge companies that want to include a MS key in their hardware? What if that company is called Apple?)",1317136108

If the user has no control over the installed keys, the user has no way to indicate that they don't trust Microsoft products. They can prevent their system booting malware. They can prevent their system booting Red Hat, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, OS X or any other operating system. But they can't prevent their system from running Windows 8.<p>Err what? This boggles the mind. If you don't trust MS, DO NOT INSTALL WINDOWS. See, it's that easy.<p>>If Microsoft were serious about giving the end user control, they'd be mandating that systems ship without any keys installed. The user would then have the ability to make an informed and conscious decision to limit the flexibility of their system and install the keys. The user would be told what they'd be gaining and what they'd be giving up.<p>Huh what? You want my mom to make an informed and conscious decision about certificate chaining?

If, for instance, you're in a privately owned public space (eg. a mall), it's fine to take photographs, but if a security guard or some other custodian of the property asks you to stop, and you don't, you are then trespassing. Likewise, in the city I live in (Toronto) it's prohibited to take commercial photographs on the TTC (subways) or in public parks without a special permit.

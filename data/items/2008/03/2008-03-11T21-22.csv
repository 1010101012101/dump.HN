They seem to take the view that startups are going to have a hard enough time without their first media appearance ripping them apart over the usual early startup pains and problems.  TC readers that comment, on the other hand, are like a more vicious and less literate TMZ that somehow views startups profiled at TC as ""the other half"" who don't have to work for a living.  Not entirely relevant to this thread, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how nice the TC folks are in print and in person, and they're enthusiastic about the whole YC concept.",1205270813

134620,comment,134380,134535,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"The way they get that number is something like this: imagine a small economy with one oil well, one gas station, and one commuter, and one speculator. The oil well owner pre-sells $1000 worth of oil to the gas station (that's $1000 in notional derivative value). The gas station owner pre-sells the same amount of oil to the commuter (that's another $1000). The commuter decides he'd rather walk, after all, and sells the same value of oil to the speculator ($1000). The speculator decides he'd rather play the soybean market anyway, and looks for someone who wants to trade oil. Alas, the only person who feels good about oil is the oil well owner, who is willing to buy $1000 worth of oil from the speculator.<p>Since nobody has canceled any of their speculative contracts, the notional value of the derivatives is the sum of the value of all of the trades: $5000. And yet, all but one of the participants made a positive bet (buying $1000 worth of oil) followed by an exactly-offsetting negative bet (selling the same amount of oil). So they all net out to zero, except the oil-well owner; we're all back where we started.<p>The problem is credit risk. If the gas station is destroyed in an earthquake, the commuter may not be able to collect on his bet with the station owner, and may thus be unable to pay the speculator, who may thus be unable to pay the oil well owner, forcing everyone to cut their spending or possibly even default. But in this case, it takes an outside catalyst, and the problem is not the derivatives themselves. The problem is credit risk. Also, earthquakes.",1205269236

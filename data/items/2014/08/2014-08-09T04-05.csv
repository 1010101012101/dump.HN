The economy does not exist for one persons or class of persons benefit.<p>>  This was done to keep salaries low, so a handful of people could make more money.<p>People cooperated to reduce their expenses without restricting the right of anyone else to cooperate. Just because people make money doesn&#x27;t make it wrong. Conversely, a handful of people (the defendants) colluded to make more money by keeping salaries high, except they did it by restricting the rights of everyone else.",1407560395

Any deviations from that are then taken as evidence that the world is wrong, unjust, etc.  In reality, humans are hierarchical social creatures with complex dynamics, and you kind of have to play by the rules that other people set for you.  In this case, a group of people broke the rules and some other people think they should be punished, and I think most of the people here have no problem with that.",1407560263

The difference between the level of code-sharing and code community between general purpose software and scientific software is just astounding. In computational neuro-modeling at least (as opposed to very intensive bio-analysis like genomics), there&#x27;s incredibly little sharing of code or interchangeability, outside of [ModelDB](<a href=""http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/</a>), although I&#x27;ve heard systems biology-modeling (like with CellML) is in a better state.<p>I love this site for many reasons, e.g. searching &quot;site:ycombinator.com <search term>&quot; is one of the best sources of finding modern opinions on languages, libraries, the state of coding in certain places, and most of all some of the best opinions on what can act as good introductory materials on anything software/langs (in addition to stackoverflow).<p>It&#x27;s nice to have a finger on different tech scenes and where people, sometimes, are willing to call each other on BS. Oppositely, it&#x27;s cool to see posts about a product/service and see that the actual company actively responds to comments here in a lively fashion.<p>One of the biggest reasons for me has been seeing whenever&#x27;s the occasional open academia article or movement starting to spawn, whether it be open access, open data (e.g. [dat](<a href=""http://dat-data.com/)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dat-data.com/)</a>), or my favorite, open code. There&#x27;s an unbelievable amount of reinventing the software wheel that goes on with a ton of PhDs, and the FOSS community proves that doesn&#x27;t have to be the case. Trying to take the lessons it&#x27;s learned to the sphere of science is something that an increasing amount of people are thankfully interested in, and this site is one of the only ways I&#x27;ve heard about initiatives in that regard - most notably, [Mozilla Science Lab](<a href=""http://mozillascience.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mozillascience.org/</a>)",1407559260

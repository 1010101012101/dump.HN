What Chua wrote did hit a resonant note in American cultural stereotypes, and that's bad, BUT, i don't think it invalidates Chua's points particularly either.<p>Chua's approach is a particular style of child rearing, but her own piece was so filled with nebulous caveats, that i found it hard to believe that anything she particularly said was rooted in being Chinese.<p>The real problem in the end, i guess, is just that she was an Asian woman saying these things.

2120394,comment,2119722,2120120,0,0,_delirium,,,"> So it would be more accurate to say that H.264 is incompatible with the FSF's idea of software freedom.<p>It depends on how you define ""compatible"", but H.264 is only sort of compatible with MIT-style licensing as well. It's compatible in the sense that, if you start with MIT-licensed software, you can slap on the required H.264 license and not violate any laws (MIT-licensed software can be relicensed under more restrictive terms). But it's incompatible in the sense that you can't actually choose to ship your software under the MIT license and the MIT license alone. In that sense, H.264's license is viral: any software that supports H.264 in any form must incorporate the the H.264 license.",1295456364

2120391,comment,2119810,2120015,0,0,geebee,,,"No way is the conclusion that they should stay in the kitchen.  The conclusion is that maybe women are better off in medicine, law, dentistry or other processions, not because they're women, but because most people would be better off in these fields.<p>I think that the reason people fail to understand why there are so few women in software development is because they frame the issue the way you just did.  They think about how to convince a young woman that engineering is better than home economics.<p>Instead, try this as an exercise: imagine you're a career counselor at a university, and a very bright young woman has just entered your office asking for advice.  She's a top student who can handle math, science, and arts/humanities, and she's got the chops to score in the high percentiles on whatever standardized test is required for a grad program.<p>Imagine a conversation where you try to talk her out of becoming a cardiologist and sell her on a grad program in computer science. Make sure you consider employment prospects, earnings potential, social prestige, job stability at age 48, and so forth.<p>This conversation will demonstrate why it's not engineering vs staying in the kitchen.  Young women are starting to out-achieve young men in the US, and I'd be surprised if this isn't the case in the UK.<p>People (who are aware that the achievement gap is now starting to favor women) often think of the scarcity of women in engineering as a dark spot in an otherwise bright picture, but one that should still be remedied.  I think they're missing the possibility that the evident aversion women have to engineering or CS is actually a <i>positive thing for women</i> - that women have realized that they can achieve more <i>real power and influence</i> in other fields.  By ""better off"" I'm not talking about some condescending ""oh, you'll be happier at home with the kids"" kind of thing.  I mean wealthy, high income, highly influential, positions of power in business and government kind of ""better off"".<p>Now for a slightly lame backtrack - I actually do think that science and engineering are amazing fields, and the scarcity of women is a complicated thing - especially at the undergraduate level (after all, the most common academic background at the bachelor's level for fortune 500 CEOs is engineering in the US).  However, I do think that the perspective I described above needs to be a big part of the analysis.  People seem to view the low participation of women in certain technical fields as a negative for women without adequately understanding the other things women are doing and the possibility that they may be making better choices than men.",1295456340

2120370,comment,2119704,2119704,0,0,malandrew,,,"I'm currently using Backbone.js + JQuery in my startup and my decision came down to the following conclusions:<p>Use Sproutcore or Cappucino if you are trying to emulate a native desktop app and where long load times are acceptable (i.e. the user sacrifices time to load everything to not have to wait much if at all after the initial loading). Also use these two environments when your users are Apple Users.<p>Use Backbone.js + JQuery in a small startup environment with a lean team where the front-end devs are multitalented (i.e. they can easily move between html/css and javascript)<p>Use a MVVM framework with bigger teams () and with teams where your front-end guys may be good with html/css and graphic design but have limited or non-existent stills when it comes to programming intermediate to advanced javascript and handling mildly to very complex programming concepts.<p>MVVM has value and I believe it was invented to solve a common communication/coordination problem in corporate-style environments and especially with ""silo""-ed teams  and matrix management. However, the way I see it will slow down a good front-end developer. MVC is much more powerful and flexible in the hands of a good dev. MVVM just adds another layer of abstraction so the pure HTML/CSS and graphic design guys don't have to get their hands dirty with real programming.<p>If you are going the Sproutcore/Cappucino route, you really are commiting yourself to a platform and certain ways of doing things from a user interaction perspective. You will gain a lot in not having to build some basic, common interfaces, but you will lose when you need to invent and create your own custom interfaces.<p>Summary:<p>Backbone.js + JQuery = Flexible, powerful, lean - Good for experienced devs<p>Knockout.js = Less powerful, simple = Overcomes coordination and cooperation issues in teams where ""the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing""<p>Cappucino/Sproutcore = Complex apps built fast, inflexibility in interface design patterns. Good for ""native-style"" apps.<p>Anyways, those are my opinions. I encourage you to challenge me on anything you don't agree with as my experience with Sproutcore/Cappucino is limited to just research and I only built one small app with Knockout.js.",1295456168

I've lived also in Madrid, Frankfurt and Barcelona for extended periods of time.<p>Things that are great in Prague for a foreigner (expat):<p>* Most people speak English, specially young people and specially in Prague. They will tell you that they don't speak English, but they do.<p>* There are a surprisingly big number of IT jobs for English speakers available. Even at startups (like the one I work at, 360cities.net).<p>* If you want to be a freelance, the tax treatment is very very favorable. Adding all the payments that you have to make to the government (including personal income tax, compulsory health insurance, and unemployment insurance), you'll end up paying less than 15% of your gross income at the end of the year to the state, in one form of another. That compares with the ~ 50% that gets deducted from employees for the same concepts.<p>* Life is affordable. Having a good life, I mean, not just surviving. Even on a local salary, you can get a decent apartment not too far from the center, eat out every day for lunch, have dinner out a couple times a week, go to the movies/theater/clubs on the weekends, and still have money left to save a little. Of course, those savings will not amount to much out of the Czech Republic, but as long as you are living here, they'll provide a comfortable cushion.\nIf you get an English speaking job, you'll probably make significantly more than a local salary. You will not live like a king, but you'll life very very comfortably.<p>* The health system is good, efficient and cheap. So it is the public transportation (one of the best systems I've tried, and I've used a few in my life).<p>* The fact that even local salaries afford for a decent live means that you won't find extreme poverty in Prague. That also means that there's no dangerous areas that you should avoid (of course, in the touristic spots there are pickpockets, but I mean that there's no wrong neighborhoods that you have to avoid, like there are in Madrid or, as is said, in US cities, for example).<p>* Cultural life is rich and varied. There's a lot of clubs with life music, concerts, theaters, operas, … Of course, there's also thousands of pubs (almost one in every corner) that serve what I would argue is the best beer in the world. And very cheap (less than 1.5 euros per half liter).<p>* The city is gorgeous.<p>* The girls are even more gorgeous.<p>* You are in the middle of Europe, which means that there's a lot of places to visit within 4 hours (train or plain).<p>* The attitude of Czech people is very relaxed. Live and let live. Consumption of sof drugs, for example marijuana, although not strictly legal is not prosecuted by the police.<p>* Personally, I think another advantage is that the Czech Republic is the most atheist country in the world. 70% of Czechs declare themselves atheists when asked. That means that the interference of religion in the lawmaking or social attitudes is minimal.<p>There are also some disadvantages, of course:<p>* The hard long winters.<p>* Service in restaurants and pubs, although improving slowly, is still not comparable with more western countries. Unhelpful or plain rude waiters and shops assistants are very common.<p>* The food lacks variety, and specially vegetables, fruits and seafood (like most Central European kitchen).<p>* Some rules in the administration are plain stupid. And civil servants will be, generally, unhelpful. A lot of the old socialist mentality can still be found in the government's employees.<p>* The language is very difficult to learn. Most people speak at least some English, but really fitting in is difficult without speaking Czech.<p>* When you want to travel abroad, everything is suddenly very expensive.",1295455695

Not like programming can be, though the solitariness seems overstated to me there too. It doesn't do anything to disprove the assertion that there is something about <i>programming</i> particularly distasteful to women, the real argument. (Which I am neither advancing nor attacking here.)<p>Like I said, all this article ""showed"" was a reiteration that there are ""no"" women in programming. You can't get to causation from there.<p>Besides, if you're going to argue that because women go into IT you can disprove some things, you need to take it <i>all the way</i>, not just use it to prove a couple of pet points then run away from the other implications, like the fact that there are obviously no systematic barriers to women in IT, and it seems rather unlikely to me that there are systematic barriers to programming occupations that don't exist in IT. Certainly I'd like to see one demonstrated rather than asserted if it's going to be the core of your argument. So using this same data we can plausibly argue that the data shows that there is something about programming that women legitimately of their own free will prefer on average not to do.<p>This is not the argument I am advancing; if I were I'd be refining it a lot more. My point for this post is that there mere fact that I <i>can</i> use this data in favor of such an argument is proof that the data proves nothing. It's not enough.

Originally it was a place for me to keep a Christmas list, but I quickly wanted to be able to add stuff like ""coffee"" to lists like ""things I love"".<p>After that, the ability to share pictures of the things I was listing sounded cool, so I added the ability to upload a photo along with whatever item you were listing.<p>Then I noticed that one of my favorite lists (songs I love) was pretty much all just links to youtube, so I added the code to automatically embed youtube videos instead of just linking to them.

Another way to identify them is to look at browsing behavior such as requests per minute, browser name, not fetching images, and the ""other patterns in their requests"" that you mention.<p>Denying them is probably easier.

After trying other things like SproutCore, Cappuccino or Evently, I'll never go back.<p>I actually ended up being surprised by how backbone changed what I do with javascript. With backbone, you can create views that are really just widgets. For example, if you have a list item, you can create a view specific to that list item. Then, all the events and state for that list item are encapsulated right there. No need to store state in the DOM, you can just fetch it from the model when it happens. This then allows you to bubble events up through the parent views to change the entire page's state. Because of the separation, you really end up having little pieces of javascript that only know about themselves and the whole picture ends up being considerably less fragile and easier to debug.<p>I'm also a big CouchDB fan. Since backbone models are just documents, the integration with CouchDB is very minimal and you get instant serialization of user state (it really is that easy, to pimp one of my projects: <a href=""https://github.com/pyronicide/backbone.couchdb.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pyronicide/backbone.couchdb.js</a>).

But in general boards can't simply fire people without cause. I would strongly suggest that you start by documenting absolutely everything. Make sure all meetings are minuted and keep your own copies of those minutes. If the bad board member says something to you outside a meeting that has some bearing on your relationship or the company, find an excuse to get him to email it to you. You can even record phone calls in many states with only one party privy to the fact the call is being recorded. (IIRC California is not one of these states).<p>Secondly, get chatting to a great corporate attorney. Email me if you need a Seattle reference. You need to get a deep understanding of how vulnerable you are and what levers you have to protect yourself and your business. Then (and I say this again) keep records of everything in the context of knowing what will help your situation.<p>This quote suggests that you are kicking ass at your business:<p>""We went through the status of the company, and at least from the outside it sounded good. In fact it sounded great: three major versions of the product shipped, multiple iterations and a few pivots under their belt, revenue was growing even faster than plan.""<p>The key here is ""...even faster than plan."". You and the board agreed to a plan and you over-delivered.

There are short periods of time in which one can code at their top level for a long period of time but these are infrequent.  In general I'd say that one can get a good 4 hours of solid work in on a given day.

The other time would be better spent thinking about the problems faced by the design and or relaxing to allow for ideas to form and work themselves to clarity.<p>When I used to work outside of my home this meant playing table tennis or fußball as a clearing ones mind method.

One of my external service providers had downtime yesterday, and autotest caught it about six hours before they did.

Unit tests should be disgustingly parallel, since they're small units of work and shouldn't depend on each other.

Without giving away too much that might be confidential about the parties involved, there is very good circumstantial evidence showing that this traffic is being driven by a competitor who is simply trying to scrape pricing for a catalog of a few hundred thousand products.<p>These bots were coming from the Amazon EC2 cloud, so it was impossible to identify them by IP address, but other patterns in their requests makes them identifiable. From these, we can determine that they were using over 6Mbps incoming bandwidth just for making their requests; at least the top 15 client IPs came from this source, rather than legitimate customers. They have never requested our robots.txt file, to see how we'd like bots to behave.<p>Because the usage is high enough that it's pegging the CPUs on our web farm, it's actually causing degraded service for legitimate customers, so it's important to me that we do something about it. It's also a headache for administration of the web servers: with usage so high, it's difficult to do maintenance without affecting customer experience.<p>Note that they've actually been doing this for some time, but shifted into high gear last week. Previously, I'd just put filtering into my usage reports so that their scraping wouldn't affect our BI reports. But now they're doing material damage.<p>What avenues might we pursue to address this? We could devote resources to finding a way to throttle bandwidth of users, but this is difficult because their usage is distributed, and we have many large corporate customers going through proxies, making them also appear to be extremely high-usage single clients (from an IP perspective). We could talk with the competitor, threatening legal action or maybe even offering to trade data with them directly. Any other suggestions?",1295453607

2120136,story,,,2,4,pdx,"Ask HN: Geolocation - Google & Linode",,"I just noticed something strange and thought I'd throw this out there to the world.<p>As I was doing a google search, I noticed that Google knew that I was in Portland, OR.  That's not that surprising, of course, until it hit me that I was surfing through ssh, and the IP address that Google saw should have been in Dallas, TX, where my Linode server is.  How did Google know I was in Portland?  I don't have the google toobar (hmmm, I am using Chrome, perhaps it's built in?)<p>So, that's the first strange thing.  The second, which is much less mysterious, but still worth mentioning, is that, as I was confirming that other websites saw my linode ip address and not my actual one, I noted that they all thought I was in Absecon, New Jersey, rather than Dallas.  It occurs to me that I have no way to know if Linode actually put my server in Dallas or at one of it's other data centers, even though they tell me it's Dallas, I have no way to check.  I thought about ping times to various Dallas and New Jersey businesses, but that doesn't help, since who knows where they are actually hosted.  How does one find out where a server they are logged into is actually located?",1295453078

Mere use of a GPL-licensed executable does not extend the GPLs terms to what you are doing (e.g. shell scripts, system() calls, etc). For each binary, the license terms of each statically or dynamically linked component must be simultaneously satisfied. The GPL includes a ""system library"" exception that excludes libraries shipped with the OS from that calculus.<p>The situation with combining interpreter code that doesn't access compiled libraries (e.g. pure octave M-files, or python code) isn't really clear to me. The FSF's opinion has been that a script that uses GPL'd interpreter code is subject to the terms of the GPL. I personally accept that interpretation out of deference to the FSF, but I've never understood specifically how that conclusion arises from the text of the GPL.",1295453008

It requires developers to restrict how their software can be used, and to collect royalties in many situations.""<p><i>According to the FSF's definition of software freedom.</i> The FSF has quite a radical view in this regard. A Microsoft exec once described the GPL as ""viral' [1] and it's a fair point. Many view licenses like MIT and Apache as being more free simply because they're not as restrictive.<p>This ambiguity is more pronounced when you use words like ""open"" because it means different things to different people.<p>So it would be more accurate to say that H.264 is incompatible with the <i>FSF's idea of software freedom</i>.<p>> if it gets entrenched<p>What do you mean ""if""? It already has.<p>> Why wait until a fiasco?<p>Because anyone who writes software knows that writing code to solve problems you <i>may never have</i> is a recipe for wasted effort if not outright disaster.<p>It's a bit like the standoff between the (former) Soviet Union and the USA: not a single shot was ever (directly) fired between the two but the threat of escalating conflict kept them in check (resulting in proxy conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, etc but I digress).<p>Think about it this way: MPEG-LA could announce tomorrow that licenses now cost $1 trillion. The result? Obviously no one would pay and a new standard would arise pretty quickly. What if it was $1 billion? $100 million? The point here it is simply a question of <i>degree</i>.<p>So what keeps (and will keep) MPEG-LA in check is market forces, the limits of what people can and will pay and the <i>threat</i> of a free or cheaper alternative... much like any market. Switching formats is a process that can be automated so the transition cost isn't really that high.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Viral_Nature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Vira...</a>",1295452871

7595596,comment,7591879,7593886,2,0,alttab,,,"I think once people understand how these devices are useful, social norms will begin to emerge, just as they have for other technologies.<p>For instance, the car-phone. Well, now the cell phone. Generally, we understand now that driving while on the cell phone is not a good thing to do. It took 10-15 years of slow driving, cops thinking people were drunk but instead just talking, and fatal accidents before we began to understand the link and creating laws.<p>And it goes the other way. In the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, beepers were not allowed in schools because &quot;that&#x27;s what drug dealers used to sell drugs.&quot; Virtually every teenager has a smartphone, capable of way more communication than a 1 or 2 way beeper did. They - probably still enforce the beeper rule today even though drug deals happen on cell phones way more than beepers these days.<p>Actually getting to my point, Glass wearers that wear them into Strip Clubs, high class or pretentious bars, or other private gatherings where it has grabbed headlines for being a problem are learning this the hard way. Google&#x27;s enemies would pay for bad Glass press all day every day. And I&#x27;m sure they do.<p>Wearing Glass today is stepping into uncharted territory. You have to be more sensitive to the capabilities of the device simply due to the environment and people&#x27;s expectations (You are wearing an NSA face drone!). My guess is, if you understand what and why you are wearing it and you use some judgement it won&#x27;t get you into trouble.",1397613541

7595594,comment,7595461,7595461,45,0,zt,,,"While I was in college, I was put on a committee to choose a new Director of Admissions. One of the internal candidates said during his interview: &quot;There is a good reason that everyone who is accepted gets in, but there is not a good reason why people are rejected.&quot;<p>It many ways that seems obvious. To get in you have to have something going for you. To not get in you don&#x27;t have to do anything wrong, you just have to not have a thing that does get you in. It would be just as hard for my college to write high school seniors a letter saying, well, you were 2nd in your class and had a 1500 but noting stood out as would be for YC to write people direct feedback at scale. What would it really mean? How do you action that? No special sauce isn&#x27;t really feedback. You can&#x27;t point to anything wrong other than you can&#x27;t point to anything great.<p>This has proven true for me in the admissions processes I&#x27;ve gone through on the other side: whether at a consulting firm, or Stripe, or Standard Treasury, or Echoing Green (I read semi-finalist apps). Most people self-select to apply for good and just reasons but some people really excite you and some people don&#x27;t. Some people just have that something special, and the people who don&#x27;t don&#x27;t really have anything wrong with them.<p>So to me this commentary rings true and is honestly put.",1397613505

Creative solutions come more easily. I tend to get distracted when trying to understand why something doesn&#x27;t work the way I think it does; it takes more work to stay focused. Good for broad association, systems thinking, and novel ideas; less good for careful analysis.<p>Whiskey is good for breaking out of analysis paralysis; it makes me happy and a little stupid, which is good for just bashing something out that works instead of going around and around about the best way to do it. Sometimes I drink when I&#x27;m coding late at night because it eventually slows me down enough that I can stop thinking about work and go do something else. A few drinks later and the code may still work but I&#x27;ll want to rewrite it all the next day.<p>Methamphetamine is an incredibly powerful tool for grinding through big jobs and maintaining focus for hours. It&#x27;s like coding with super-powers. Whatever you focus on, you FOCUS ON IT; you can just sink your teeth in and bash away at it for seemingly ever, hours and hours of clear, crisp, effective code. It&#x27;s hard to pull back and look at the big picture, because you just want to pound away at the keyboard building on what&#x27;s right in front of you, but on balance it is still a more productive state of mind for coding than sobriety is.  Alas, it&#x27;s also very addictive, and worthy of extreme respect.<p>LSD is... fun, but not helpful.

I&#x27;m a novice, so please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>The &quot;greedy&quot; behavior would be when minors explicitly prefer a sequence of transactions such as:<p>Customer => Merchant: X+ε (1)<p>Merchant => <i>fees: X+ε    (1)<p>over<p>Customer => Customer: X+ε (2)<p>Going so far as to swap out (2) with (1), even if they already have (2). If there is no double spend, presumably the trustworthy merchant would send back ε after sufficient confirmation [</i>]. Or, in a world with fees, the ε would be fees in the original transaction (still serving the purpose of costing the malicious customer Bitcoin, even with successful double spend).<p>That seems like a decent solution.<p>[*] Or I suppose it could be in the same block.

You just download a bitcoin client, and it generates addresses for you.

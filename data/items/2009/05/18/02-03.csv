There's no conflict--It's consistent with their religious war against ""racism"".  Believe me, any statistics that show blacks in a genuinely negative light (for instance, murder rates, burglary rates, rape rates, etc.) are rarely mentioned.  When they <i>are</i> mentioned, they usually finesse it so it looks like whitey drove them to it.<p>For years, rags like the NYT bitched and moaned about banks not giving credit to minorities.  So, the government forces banks to do just that. When the inevitable occurs, the same rags bitch and moan about an excess of foreclosures for the protected groups.

This user base is not coextensive with people interested in downloading music.<p>Scribd has built up an audience of users interested in reading things.<p>(More broadly iTunes is a footnote on the gigantic tome of marketing success that is the iPod, and their profits are rounding error next to the money made selling 4 GB hard disks to people who are probably not spending $20k to fill them, but that is neither here nor there.

3996514,comment,3995185,3996209,6,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I count 3 ""miracles"".  In ascending order of awesomeness, these would be:<p>(1) No feature creep.  They provide essential functionality, little more.  I say that's a good thing, because if you miss functionality, the system lets you build it relatively easily.  My guess is, it explains about 1 order of magnitude (it divides code volume by 10).<p>(2) Factor everything.  Again not very impressive, but it goes a long way.  Just good engineering principles applied systematically across the system.  For instance, they have <i>one</i> graphic stack, which draws everything in every program, including the window manager.  They also have <i>one</i> document type.  A side effect of this approach is a greatly increased integration.  My guess is, it explains about 1 order of magnitude.<p>(Warning: the divide between (1) and (2) is somewhat arbitrary. In some ways, the STEPS system provide <i>more</i> functionality than current systems.  I think the trick is to stop thinking in terms of features, but in terms of capabilities.  For instance, UNIX don't have a feature to sort Apache log files by IP address.  But it has `sort` and `awk`, and therefore it has the capability.)<p>(3) Build the right tools.  The tools being mostly domain specific programming languages.  And <i>that</i> is the impressive part.  Their language are so expressive and simple that they can reduce code volume by <i>two</i> orders of magnitude without breaking a sweat.  I don't know exactly how they came up with such languages, yet they did.  The tree core languages that may interest you here are Ometa <a href=""http://www.tinlizzie.org/ometa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tinlizzie.org/ometa/</a>, Maru <a href=""http://piumarta.com/software/maru/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piumarta.com/software/maru/</a>, and Nile.  Ometa is like Lex+Yacc, only much simpler and more general (it lets you transform trees, and flatten them, which makes it suitable for all compilation stages).  Maru is a not-so-inefficient self-implementing language, based on 2 cores (lambdas and objects) which can implement each other.<p>So, 1+1+2=4.  Or 10<i>10</i>100=10,000.  I'm oversimplifying of course, but I think this gives an idea.",1337449649

If the stocks goes down, you are looking for short/long terms supports it may [temporarily] stop on. Those are usually backed up by either history of the stock (recent supports) or psychological barriers (like a round number). In situation of a stock with couple hours of history those will be psychological like number 38. Then a trader looks how much support there is on certain level. In this example there were about $300MM (IIRC) worth of stock somebody asked to buy. So if you ready to sell because there is a panic and stock does not want to go up, you see so much cheddar [of support at $38] that someone is willing to buy that you tell yourself: ""there is no chance someone will sell so much stock, so it won't go lower"". So you don't sell at this point of time. Less people want to sell, more demand for the stock. Stock then stops or goes up, BUT at least the fall was indefinitely defended.<p>But again, depends what decisions big fish will do over this weekend, Monday morning you may see shit on $38, or if they offer plenty for sell at any price, you may see a gap down like start trading at $36.<p>Hope this helps.",1337448905

No one is criticizing you for correctly perceiving the business value there.<p>I used PHP professionally for almost four years, at places like Flickr and Wikipedia. It definitely packs a lot of power - it's fast at what it does, has every library you probably want built in already or available with a little config. And, out of the box, it matches the request-response loop in web programming much more simply than most languages do.<p>Unfortunately, even with these good qualities, PHP just has a <i>lot</i> of misdesign in it. It's not elitism to point this out.<p>Just look carefully at your own practices and you'll see that a lot of what you do is defending yourself against bad practices that PHP is subtly (or unsubtly) trying to impose on you. It's telling that PHP is a template language, but in order to achieve useful results, you really have to use another template language on top of it, like Smarty or Symfony or whatever the cool thing is these days. And even so, to this day, Rasmus thinks that such frameworks are misguided, and that real programmers should just use the built-in templating of PHP (i.e. embedding blocks of code in HTML) and nothing else. How anyone can work for over 15 years on the web and still think this is beyond me.<p>For most of its existence PHP's only guiding principle was expediency and one-off hacks. That's how you get a 'feature' where you can inject evil values into the script just by parsing CGI arguments. Or, the ability to just ignore errors by prepending an at sign. This is almost NEVER a good idea, and introducing a feature like that means that in any large project you never can be sure what's really going on, without actually looking for all instances of this all the time.<p>And what kind of language makes a keyword like 'array()'? PHP is a supposedly dynamic language, but it almost goes out of its way to make manipulating complex data structures difficult. Compare to Perl and Python, which make deep data structures easy and also easy to transform and manipulate. Instead PHP has insecure, hacky misfeatures like variable variable names. This is something that beginner programmers often want, until they learn about actual data structures.<p>I have a feeling you may not be all that familiar with other languages, or for that matter, PHP. There are experts who choose PHP, but they acknowledge these difficulties.",1337447946

Facebook gives Morgan the right (but not the obligation) to cover its short position by buying shares at the offering price. This is a defensive maneuver.<p>If the stock pops, Morgan buys the shares from Facebook at the offering price in order to cover its short. Otherwise they'd have to purchase at the market price (which would cause them to lose money). This is the hoped for scenario.<p>In the unexpected case, where the stock's price trends below the offering price, Morgan covers its short by buying shares directly from the market (instead of from Facebook). This stabilizes the price of the stock at the offering price and ensures that public investors don't go underwater soon after the offering.<p>It sounds like there are some complicated maneuvers that the underwriter can pull to make some money off the greenshoe (it's not all flowers and sunshine: <a href=""http://dealbreaker.com/2012/05/facebook-ipo-goes-nowhere-in-exciting-fashion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbreaker.com/2012/05/facebook-ipo-goes-nowhere-in-...</a>) but this particular implementation seems relatively good to Facebook and the public investors.",1337447639

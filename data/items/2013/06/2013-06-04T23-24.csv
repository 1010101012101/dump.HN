You can pay at a convenience store and get Amazon to ship your goods to a convenience store. Japan (similar to India) is still very much a cash based society and I suppose some people prefer to pay in cash at a convenience store instead of paying online.<p>India also has loads of tiny convenience stores, I think this is an excellent idea. It also simplifies the logistics. The eCommerce company only has to build out a supply chain to the convenience store instead of having to deliver to each customer or rely on the Indian postal service.<p>(I have lived both in India and Japan)",1370390370

5822825,comment,5820785,5820785,17,0,grellas,,,"Very simple. Very clean. Kudos for having the right spirit of honesty and transparency. VCs have lately taken to bearing their own attorneys' fees on occasion but I have rarely seen a significant VC deal in which the option pool is not brought in as a back-door way of lowering valuation for the founders. Removing that bit of legerdemain from the valuation equation is really quite stunning.<p>Of course, the question is whether this will catch on and stick, even during bad times. When markets are sunny for investors, it is not too hard to bend for the founder concerns. When things are tight, though, the pattern has always been one of merciless slaughter of the founder interest, as evidenced by any down round within memory. So too, in bad times such as the dot-bust period, atrocities like participating preferred and multiple-x liquidation preferences frequently reared their heads and would, I think do so again in any new time of debacle. While individual investors such as Mr. Altman may refrain from this sort of thing, I wonder whether such moderation would ever become the norm. I would tend to doubt it.<p>I also think that even this particular term sheet, though undoubtedly fair to founders in its overall sweep, would need to be adapted to avoid unfairness as it is applied to various cases. If a founder has built large value by the time of Series A, it is very non-standard to require that founder to put the entirety of his stake at risk of forfeiture all over again as a condition to getting funded. That, I assume, would be an obvious point of negotiation and one on which any investor would very likely yield when pressed.<p>These are mere quibbles, though. It is really the spirit of the thing that counts and not the legalese as such. Just as the best contract in the world will not really protect you if you happen to be dealing with a scoundrel, so too the flimsiest of contracts will likely not cause you too much trouble if you are dealing with someone of honesty and integrity. This term sheet reflects the right values that an investor should bring to a deal and, if you get that as a founder, you are 99% of the way there as long as your business interests can match. In the end, that is what counts most of all.",1370389698

It's just like people do the impossible with strong will and when there is a complete lack of will they simply never will. And building weapons and military infrastructure was something the US always wanted - something they learned, because they learned war, weapons and military brings money, power and a form of social infrastructure, while still being able to call it non-socialist. Those are all benefits. Hope that doesn't sound negative, but as a matter of fact the US has really much power, especially with their agencies and real problems with preventing enemy nations from building atomic bombs.<p>On the other hands smaller countries, like Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Austria, ... probably have the resources, monetary and scientifically (else they could buy them), but have a complete lack of interest, just like the ordinary physics student has a complete lack of interest. In fact I even know someone with a startup who is really scared of their technology being used for weapons and he does everything to prevent this (they make amazing drones and Hollywood and stuff are already really interested, cause it has a camera that allows to make pictures/films that could not be done before). He also lost friends because they got into military stuff - like they were killed.<p>Anyway, this article states that these were people who studied physics and were not into weapons and did only use public information, but that's really far from reality of someone who would target and have the real will to create a nuclear weapon. Many circumstances would most likely be way better for someone who really wants to.<p>Now one can do some research on this topic, but the US, kinda as part of their military system also has a huge army when it comes to agencies and invests like an unlimited amount of money into them, so it can pretty much flood Iranian science institutions with agents. I mean, they often had agents that got into way higher political positions than they intended and stuff like that. And military spending is just extreme in the US (look it up on Wikipedia if you haven't seen the figures yet).<p>So basically nuclear weapons are a lot about will, but also fear. I mean looking at the world and how the official US tends to act a lot of states that could have interests in such weapons doesn't want to, cause it would result into a nearly automatic invasion, be it by agents or military from the US.<p>Okay, I don't know how hard it really is. I mean according to the US the Iran was really close (weeks/months away) from the atomic bomb since the eighties or so. I don't know what stopped them, whether it really just were agents or whether there were other reasons, but given these facts and how much the Iran (according to the US! (not saying you can trust the other side more though)) wants this weapons there has to be more than a bit of cyber war, which really was  more like public ""look how cool we are"" thing. I mean they put in agents there to place that worm and I am pretty sure he could have done many things and they just did it for the public.",1370388711

5822761,comment,5814669,5814669,3,0,greening,,,"Scrum definitely focuses on ""What"", but it is much more than the author claims. The difference between Scrum and ""old school engineering"" (aka waterfall) is primarily that Scrum actually measures the full production cycle; you can't do that with the long development cycles of waterfall. If you use Scrum to measure the full development cycle (which means you actually ship the Sprint product), you can then use velocity to forecast feature delivery in the future with some statistical justification.<p>If your engineers say that ""agile doesn't forecast"", they are giving you a snow-job. They are using agile as a weapon against naive Product Managers who don't understand Scrum and why it was created. Scrum was designed to replace the inaccuracies of waterfall ""pseudo forecasting"", which had resulted in many projects failing dramatically. Basically, waterfall ""planning"" is hypothesis without any verification. In contrast, Scrum verifies with shipped product every Sprint.<p>Astute product managers can use Scrum's verified velocity to forecast far into the future, with the usual tools of statistics (such as standard deviation, etc.). It isn't prescient, but it's the best we have. Waterfall is far worse.<p>Scrum done well is an experimental framework for measuring and improving feature production. It works when done well, but it is hard to do.<p>You can think of Scrum as a religion, but only in the way that atheism/agnosticism is a ""religion"". There's faith-based development and that includes waterfall; there's reality-based development and that includes Scrum (but could include any other technique where you measure and forecast using shipped product and velocity).<p>On the matter of Product Management, Scrum's short iterations buy you something cool: You can do Lean Product Management a la Eric Ries. This is the Product converse of Development's Scrum. Lean Product Management says ""We don't know that much about the market, so let's run experiments to find out more, then let's adapt as we learn.""<p>Scrum lets you experiment with production; Lean Product lets you experiment with markets. If you are certain that your production methods are sufficient (and you don't need truthful forecasting), then you don't need the experimentation of Scrum. If you are certain your market hypotheses are right, then you don't need the experimentation of Lean Product.",1370388561

What is the key point that made it necessary?<p>I'm aware of it being introduced by McCarthy in the original Lisp paper in 1960 of course. But I suspect what McCarthy originally meant is not what garbage collection turned out to be. What I suspect he meant was that there needs to be a way for memory to be managed. malloc/free offer a way for memory to be managed, and presumably they weren't invented until C was nine years later. What McCarthy might have meant is what became malloc/free in C, which doesn't need garbage collection.<p>C isn't the only flag here. Was there any OS on the IBM 704 used to implement the original Lisp? Did the OS support multiprocessing? Because if it didn't (UNIX wasn't invented until 1969 either) it would make sense for memory to be available for a single process. And it would mean when people said garbage collection they were envisioning malloc/free.<p>(Also, databases and operating systems can live without whatever makes garbage collection necessary, since they don't use it,  and those are pretty complex and fast pieces of software.)<p>So, what makes garbage collection different than malloc/free, and why is it necessary?

If it does, that should be a non-fatal error condition. But I digress.<p>Keep in mind that real-time systems are unique in that -- unlike most software -- they have well-understood requirements and limits. There shouldn't be anything 'irregular'. If there is, then you don't fully understand your system and need to do some analysis.<p>But that said, it's not up to you or I to determine what is 'reasonable'. That's up to the certification body, and they're notoriously conservative about what they will certify (with good reason, I might add). If something causes non-deterministic behaviour, and is not necessary for the function of the system, they will almost certainly ask 'why is that there?' and you'd better have a good answer.<p>Anecdote: I once had a similar thing happen. As a rookie, I once had to implement a search algorithm for one reason or another. I decided to use a recursive implementation of binary search. This routine was flagged during certification. The problem with recursion is that, unlike an iterative solution, as the problem size grows, a recursive algorithm grows in memory as well as time (we couldn't assume the compiler would be smart enough to use tail recursion) and it's hard to prove the maximum stack usage statically. I know, I tried and ended up replacing it with an iterative implementation of binary search.",1370387568

Last I'd looked at it (this was early iOS 5), though, it caused really nasty issues with a preloading gallery I was working on. We ended up having to preload several slides in advance, as iOS would just flatly refuse to do anything in the page until the user had removed their finger from the page. The context switching I'll give you. I really meant that the browser appears to stop doing all its stuff while you're touching the screen, not that the system comes to a full halt.

Over the past 4+ years I've been at this job, I have come to realize that this is a very, very rare skill. I don't think it has much to do with being able to communicate (English isn't even my native language!), but rather being able to think in abstract terms and recognize patterns among different ideas.<p>One neat trick I learned over the course of my career when talking to non-engineers is to use analogies, especially car-related ones. For example, trying to explain a named user licensing model to someone who has never dealt with software licensing before will be a nightmare. But if you say ""it's like having assigned parking spaces, where every parking space is assigned to an individual,"" people just <i>get it</i>. Whereas an engineer will describe how the model works from a software perspective, and the non-tech person will just bang their head against a wall thinking themselves as stupid.",1357149563

The same for 10 Milliliters, 10 grams and 100 grams. Over the entire metric system the base 10 increments that are human scale are always ignored. The liter is the only one that comes close.

We need to protect the invested parties interests.""<p>Eh, I don't think you'll hear much talk about artists when the copyright lobbyists meet with our elected representatives.  More likely, you'll hear this:  copyrights are an important source of revenue for a major part of the US economy.  We need stronger copyrights to protect that revenue stream.  The only time people talk about artists is when they are appealing to the general public's moral sentiments.<p>""Against (Current) Copyright: Internet. It's companies who Copyright protects not Artists. Copyright actually stifles creativity and application of invention.""<p>It depends on who you ask.  People in the anti-copyright crowd (like myself) are not all united on what should change.  RMS has said that copyright can be good e.g. when applied in the way that the GPL applies it, or that it can be bad, so the system should be reformed to ensure that GPL-style application is promoted (or GFDL for written documents, or creative commons, etc.).  My view is that copyright was made obsolete by the development of PCs and global computer networks, and that a new system must be developed to ensure that artists are paid, that scientists can publish papers, and that the utility of PCs and the Internet must be legally protected (e.g. we must ensure that we, the general public, have access to computers that are not restricted or designed to fight us, and we must ensure that we continue to have access to a global communication network that makes no distinction between the nodes connected to it).  There are some who want to create a complete anarchy, where copying is entirely unregulated -- where no system for ensuring access to creative works exists.<p>""It's all high level creation issues""<p>That is not really true.  Copyright is about you, even if you do not personally do the sort of work that copyrights cover.  Copyright is about your ability to access human knowledge; it is about your right to sing ""Happy Birthday;"" it is about your continued access to things like the Internet, and ensuring that the Internet does not degenerate into a cable TV network (which is a system designed with copyrights in mind).  The combination of PCs and the Internet has the potential to upend copyrights and completely change the way in which knowledge and entertainment spread, having an impact as broad and lasting as the printing press (which was the reason copyright was first created) or as writing itself (which forever changed the way information was passed from generation to generation).  Human civilization is made possible by communication, and copyrights are about communication; if you do not care about copyrights today, you will eventually be forced to care, should copyright law continue its outrageous expansion (and there is no reason to think the expansion will stop any time soon).",1357148226

I taught myself PHP in grade 7 (around fifteen years ago, it must have been near the v3 release) and sold websites in high school. I hand built everything on web servers I compiled from source.<p>Then I made the terrible mistake of taking a long break from professional programming through university (I worked as a tech writer instead, the money was good). When I came back two years ago I found that I had to learn a whole new set of tools. Javascript was now the norm instead of a disabled annoyance. Browsers supported incredible display features using stylesheets which made my table-and-images based designs obsolete. All the sites were built using some sort of CMS.<p>I spent a year learning front end design, WordPress, Magento, Joomla, and Drupal theme design. Then I went back to my old do-it-yourself ways and wrote my own CMS [0]. Suffice to say that it wasn't necessary. I learned a lot about back end programming and MVC related design patterns while creating it, but the most valuable piece of knowledge I gained was ""Don't reinvent and try to sell the wheel when other people are offering it for free."" It should have been obvious, but it seems I'm much smarter in hindsight than I was in planning.<p>I'm still learning today. Now it's the Ruby on Rails world and a whole plethora of new technologies come into play. I'm using Haml, SCSS and CoffeeScript on top of the RoR / PostgreSQL back end. My first web app will be ready for release soon. After that it's on to learning Haskell and RethinkDB.<p>The irony of all this is back when I stopped programming I thought I had a pretty good grasp on everything I needed to know. I figured I'd step right back into web development and continue on the way it had been when I left it. I wouldn't have let my skills atrophy if I had known how important it was to stay up to date. I think after two years I'm finally catching up, and I don't intend to let them get rusty again.<p>TL;DR:\nDon't get cozy because you think you know everything now.

Put simply, I want a daily-use desktop system (linux or BSD) on which I can instantaneously modify some source code to fix bugs or add new features if I want to. I need it to be stable --granted that my modifications might break something--, upgradable, and in general easy to use, with the exception that I'd need to compile stuff.<p>As I feel comfortable using Debian, there's the option of downloading the source package for that specific software I want to modify, which puts you in conflict with already installed packages. BSD ports and Gentoo's portage allow this. They allow you to build a system from scratch, you actually use upstream code with some patches to adapt it to your system, and it's easy to hack something, recompile it and make install.<p>Then there's the issue of source code clarity. Here's mkdir.c:<p>* Linux http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/mkdir.c<p>* OpenBSD http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/bin/mkdir/mkdir.c?rev=1.24;content-type=text%2Fx-cvsweb-markup<p>* Plan9base (just for fun) http://git.suckless.org/9base/tree/mkdir/mkdir.c<p>Up to this point, it seems that the only feasible choices are LFS (too complicated to install), Gentoo (GNU code is kind of bloated), and then the BSDs.<p>Of those, Open's documentation is excellent, and Net's code is simple and clear. Both would work. However, I read OpenBSD's documentation, and it states explicitly that ""you probably want to use precompiled packages"". I'm unsure if that is to discourage newbies or honest advice.<p>I want to be able to modify the desktop software I'm running, and I'd like some advice from fellow readers who might already have a setup like this one. My biggest fears are upgrades, new upstream versions with new patches on software I've modified, or new system releases. Is this unmaintainable on the long run?<p>Thanks!",1357147692

NAT tends to run slowly as memory exhaustion takes hold and many times the only option is to shorten the timeout window on connections. (Admittedly, the default settings for NAT table timeouts is ridiculous; sometimes up to 300 seconds). With long default timeouts, it's no wonder these simple MIPS systems are overwhelmed.<p>Count how many tabs you have open now, and consider that they all may be using the same number of ports the services you're building do. Not to mention the ad networks...etc<p>All I'm really trying to get across is, more ports, especially on consumer devices, does have diminishing returns despite its apparent immediate benefit.<p>Yes, newer routers do have better hardware. Yes, your AWS machine can handle tons of connections. But your end users may be like you, they may not know how much memory their local router has or particularly care.<p>I'm not advocating anything other than moderation the number of sockets you employ. I just wanted to get this out there.",1357147460

4997749,comment,4996215,4996215,24,0,uladzislau,,,"I've being a ZipCar member for a year and this is why I cancelled my account recently:<p>1) Availability\nThere's no way you can reserve a ZipCar exactly WHEN you need it. Most ZipCars are spread evenly between locations and in a popular ones you can only reserve something available a few days in advance. This makes the idea of using ZipCar useless because now you need to waste an hour of your time commuting to a remote ZipCar location. Weekends? Forget about it. Unless again you'd like to travel to an inconvenient remote location or book 3 days in advance.<p>2) Missing/broken car - ruined plans\nIt happened to me twice but this was enough to make me reconsider ZipCar. Once I reserved a car for a day for a very important trip but when I showed up at a parking location my car was missing. ZipCar CSR on the phone refunded my order and offered drive credits but has no idea of what was going on. Needless to say how frustrating the whole experience was. The second time my reserved car was out of order, it just simply wouldn't drive normally. No way I would be happy to exchange this stress and ruined plans for 50$ in driving credits!<p>3) Dirty Car/low on fuel\nA couple of times the car I reserved was as dirty inside/outside as it can be after days of abuse on the country roads or in the mud races. And the only thing I could do is to report the issue to ZipCar. I still have to use this dirty car for my business trip.<p>The other annoying issue has been a car low on fuel. Despite taking a car for a couple of hours the first thing I have to do was to locate a gas station and fuel the car.<p>4) Overpayment and stress\nFirst of all, advertised ""starting as low as"" prices are non existent or impossible to find. They say you save money using ZipCar. This might be true if you're using ZipCar a couple times a month for a few hours. If you need a car for more than that you're certainly better using a conventional rental company.<p>Considering that a few rental companies offer ""driver pickup and dropoff"" service it makes ZipCar highly inconvenient and stressful if you think about all above mentioned issues. I personally found myself extending reservation hours a few times, hurring up like crazy when there was not an option to do it. 5 or more hours using ZipCar equals in price to a 24hrs. using almost any other car rental company.<p>5) Damage horror stories\nZipCar damage waiver is a joke. You can buy an extended waiver which covers only 750$ in damage. Again unlike other conventional rental companies which would happily provide you with a full damage waiver.<p>Fortunately it didn't happened to me but there's a bunch of horror stories around when ZipCar users were asked to pay fully for the damaged car or had to fight with ZipCar for a long time even if it wasn't their fault.",1357147182

There are loads of cheap low-end Android devices that are able to browse the internet, but the people who buy them are not so interested in that. Apple doesn't make low-end phones (although they do sell old models), so it is a much more conscious decision to spend that much money on a phone.

His favorite Mexican restaurant ""Mi pato esta en fuego"" has only received 2.4 stars! John wants to find food that he specifically will like, not just restaurants that are rated well. As luck may have it, John happens to have access to a massive amount of perfect data. So far, so good.<p>John does some Google searches and finds that a ""k-nearest-neighbors algorithm"" might be what he's looking for. He happens to have scored a free SQL Server license from an old barfly in exchange for listening to his tales about how wonderful life was when the mafia controlled New York, so naturally John searches for ways to implement kNN algorithms in SQL.<p>John finds out that kNN can be implemented efficiently using a spatial index, but that only works for two dimensions. That doesn't work because John really wants to judge places by location, price, and the ridiculousness of their dessert menu. So he spends a few hours trying to hack things together and finally posts an extremely specific question on StackOverflow about extending spatial indexes to 3 dimensions. He gets several answers that are technically correct but don't quite solve his problem and finally gives up, resigned to eat at popular restaurants for the rest of his days.<p>But if John had asked about the general problem of implementing kNN algorithms in SQL, he would have found that spatial indexes aren't the best method.<p>If he had asked about implementing kNN algorithms in general, he would have found that SQL isn't the best language for it.<p>If he had asked about creating recommendations based on like/dislike data, he would have found that there are better algorithms than kNN, and that there are several existing GUIs/APIs for these algorithms.<p>And if he had asked about the general problem of finding good food, well, his friends might have told him that Yelp already has a ""personal concierge"" mode and he just has to click a different setting.<p>Poor John.",1357146757

Zipcar gave me the option of:-<p>a) Getting my 150 back and leaving Zipcar, although I would be free to rejoin and pay an annual sub.<p>b) Keep my existing 0/year deal but have the 150 deposit converted into 150 of credit that had to be used within 9 months (I think). Went for this and the 150 credit was quickly gone in two 24 hour rentals to go see family.<p>To be clear, I kind of expect Avis to end up backing out of the ""founder members"" deal and I'll be annoyed if they do, but there's nothing much I can do to stop it, and I don't see anything in the existing (or previous) T&Cs that would prevent it.<p>On one hand Avis are big enough to just keep the deal going for the existing members, maybe start to offer a new service that is only available to members that pay an annual sub.

Think about that the next time someone tells you Microsoft doesnt have a future.""<p>Two words, Xerox PARC.<p>At Sun there was a weird joke that Sun Labs was where good ideas went to die. It was frustrating.<p>The point here is that good R&D is a necessary but not sufficient component of innovation, the second is a willingness to productize your work. Strangely the hardest thing about that is <i>not</i> making a product out of it, the hardest thing is making a product you can ship.<p>Good R&D isn't constrained, which is to say that you don't tell the folks doing the research you are only researching things we can sell for a profit, but that is a constraint on products. What happens is the 'Apple effect' where you have a bunch of researchers who can't make a profitable product (Xerox Star) and then a product guy comes along (Steve Jobs) who sees the essence of the innovation, and can strip away the parts where it goes too far and ships that.<p>Its really challenging to build something close to your vision and not ship it, it seems like it is impossible to build something that is close to your vision and then ship something only half as close as that. But that is where the success can be. ""Fumbling the Future"" [1] is a fascinating read for that reason.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fumbling-Future-Invented-Personal-Computer/dp/1583482660"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Fumbling-Future-Invented-Personal-Comp...</a>",1357146203

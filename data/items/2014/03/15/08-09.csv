7404085,comment,7402571,7402911,1,0,davidad_,,,"This is a fair point which deserves a response.<p>Before text was invented, people communicated using spoken language. Text was a major breakthrough because once some communication was written, it became a physical object which could be stored in libraries, carried by sea or horseback, and read by more than one person. However, it was a compromise: you could no longer interact with the reader. As a result, most people prefer to communicate interactively. Even people who cannot speak use sign language instead of resorting to text.<p>What we are doing right now is a hybrid of textual and interactive communication; we&#x27;re taking turns writing chunks of text. In the programming world, this is roughly equivalent to a REPL. But actually developing software using a REPL is still quite uncommon; I think it&#x27;s reserved mostly for Emacs Lisp hackers.<p>We&#x27;re doing this instead of communicating by audio partly to create a public indexable record of our correspondence, partly to protect our privacy, partly for synchronization reasons, and partly due to arbitrary norms and the information systems that co-evolved with them; but mostly to save ourselves from mentally keeping track of the edits we make to our expressions before committing them (&quot;scratch that...what I meant to say is..&quot;). When the target of one&#x27;s communication is a machine with a visual display, that latter concern completely evaporates.<p>Naturally, the screen editor (introduced in 1961 as Expensive Typewriter for the PDP-1 and pretty well refined by the NLS era) implements this suggestion thoroughly. Yet, generally, the screen editor is used only to edit pieces of text, which are then separately turned into programs. What I&#x27;m proposing is nothing more outrageous than a screen editor which edits programs directly instead of textual representations thereof.",1394873920

Right now, musicians think streaming rates are too low, and the streaming services are operating at a loss.  That basically means they are unsustainable, and that musicians are not willing to release their music at a rate the consumers want to pay.  Because of debt financing, consumers are currently under the impression that they&#x27;re entitled to this music anyway, but the gravy train might very well end, and then easy music enjoyment might become more scarce.

Also, algebraic functions don&#x27;t return, they are - cos(0) is 1, it doesn&#x27;t return 1, it doesn&#x27;t compute 1, it is not a kind of computer, nor a kind of program, nor any kind of thing that consumes resources and time and returns a value; it really literally is 1.<p>Algebraic functions are just syntactic notation. You can sit down and convert from one notation to another, like how cos(5) is a number quite close to 0.28366218546322625, and deriving one representation from the other does take resources and time, because it&#x27;s a physical process performed by a person or computer.<p>But sin, cos, tan, cotan, log and all their friends by themselves don&#x27;t compute, they are just a different kind of notation for numbers.<p>Which is why I find the desire to make functions in programming like algebraic functions silly - by definition they are two completely different things.

What I&#x27;ve noticed is that my brain manages very well if I have prolonged periods of intense &quot;sciencing&quot; and it also works well if I take some time to learn languages.<p>However, if I try to do half a day of thinking about algorithms and then half a day of language learning, I will get a headache and slight nausea! Might be that this only happens to me because of some &quot;manufacturing error&quot;, but I&#x27;ve tried it repeatedly and it invariably happens.<p>This has lead me to form the following, highly unproven, high-level working heuristic about the brain: The brain might be just like the rest of our body. You can train to be a weightlifter, or you can train to be a marathon runner. If you do both over the course of your life, you can become good at both, but you&#x27;ll probably never become the worlds best at any of the two.<p>If you do intense training on both without a resting period in between, you&#x27;ll hurt yourself.<p>So that&#x27;s my weird theory, for what it&#x27;s worth.<p>That said, I think your child has a lot to gain from the broad knowledge he receives. I can tell you from experience that this is the age of interdisciplinarity, and it&#x27;s a lot of fun.",1394871904

Britain goes to &quot;BST&quot; (British Summer Time) during the summer. From Wikipedia[1]:<p>> Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) originally referred to the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, which later became adopted as a global time standard. It is for the most part the same as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and when this is viewed as a time zone, the name Greenwich Mean Time is especially used by bodies connected with the United Kingdom, such as the BBC World Service, the Royal Navy, the Met Office and others particularly in Arab countries, such as the Middle East Broadcasting Center and OSN. It is the term in common use in the United Kingdom and countries of the Commonwealth, including Australia, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Malaysia, and many other countries in the Eastern Hemisphere.<p>> Before the introduction of UTC on 1 January 1972, Greenwich Mean Time (also known as Zulu time) was the same as Universal Time (UT), a standard astronomical concept used in many technical fields.<p>> In the United Kingdom, GMT is the official time during winter; during summer British Summer Time (BST) is used. GMT is the same as Western European Time.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMT</a>",1394871886

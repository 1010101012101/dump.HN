I'm not going to act upon the idea but figured I'd share it with the community to see what others think. The idea may be a little far-fetched, but since I've experienced this problem several times I think it is worth a shot.<p>Greeting cards and invitations are here to stay. They are not going anywhere. When people are having weddings, bridal showers, graduation parties, etc. they are sending out invitations to family and friends, and usually the invitations say please RSVP by X date or email us by X date to let us know if you are coming. The only problem is, I've found that MANY people forget to RSVP and never respond.<p>The idea: An invitation that has RSVP buttons built in. You can select attending/not attending and the # of people, and it automatically (through wifi or some other means) lets the event planner know who is/isn't attending.<p>Has anyone else experienced this problem? We had a party last year, about 15 people didn't respond so I called them up and they were like 'oh yes we forgot to respond, we will be there"".",1308412441

A lot of people would argue that it detracts from peoples lives (degrading the real-life experience of interacting with people), but a lot of people would also argue that it improves lives.<p>Now take finance.  Forget about blankfein's ""god's work"" remark.  In general, most parts of finance improve lives (though most HNers would disagree).  Look at market making (providing liquidity for other traders).  There's an intrinsic demand for liquidity from funds which try to manage an index, hedgers, and speculators.  The goal of market making is to provide liquidity to facilitate those other traders.  And yes, there's a small premium for the service, but the fact that the premium is shrinking over time reflects a lower cost for the rest of society.",1308410792

Pyramid might also be good, but I haven't used it much. I tend to avoid Django because the ORM just isn't as good as SQLAlchemy, and the template language isn't as good as Jinja.<p>Not sure why everyone is suggesting the standard enterprisey platforms Java and .NET. You control the server environment completely, right? Go with a dynamic language for development speed, then. The big ones for the web are Ruby, Python, and PHP. Of those: PHP is a mess of a language with no big advantages; Ruby and Python are both great languages with all the libraries you need (probably :), but I give Python the edge because things in the Python world tend to have much better documentation.",1308410531

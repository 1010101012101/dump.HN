Tl;dr: they took a C interpreter for Java (with unsafe memory management) and implemented fat pointers (Java object + offset) in the interpreter.<p>The paper claims the implementation obeys C99, but there seems to be a violation around pointer round-tripping.

  The foo warning is superfluous because ...
</code></pre>
> it&#x27;s an unnecessary stroke of the shift key<p>This is not a good reason to argue for a style convention. The effort or time of pressing &quot;shift+letter&quot; is no greater than simply pressing &quot;letter&quot; for all experienced typists since they are pressed simultaneously and the decision to capitalize a letter and execute the necessary keypress is completely automatic and fluid. If we were discussing rarely-used symbols and keystrokes then the analysis might be different.<p>There is great value in following the language&#x27;s style convention since its readers are familiar with that convention. Upper case denotes the beginning of a sentence. When you scan a series of lines beginning in upper case, there&#x27;s a visual cue that they&#x27;re each their own unit, as opposed to (for example) the wrapping of a previous line.<p><pre><code>  Don&#x27;t warn in case foo
  Update bar dependency
  Warn user when baz
</code></pre>
These scan better to me as a series of three independent thoughts than the equivalent in lower case, which seems like a poorly written haiku:<p><pre><code>  don&#x27;t warn in case foo
  update bar dependency
  warn user when baz
</code></pre>
Personal preference might differ, but my opinion based on seeing many variations is that programming texts such as documentation, commit messages, etc., are most readable when they follow the syntax and style of regular English text, to leverage all of the standard cues that the reader is familiar with. Readability usually suffers when one breaks from convention.<p>Lastly, following regular conventions gives you the advantage that you can copy/paste text across various scenarios without having to change it. Need to reference a commit message in an email? Well, just copy it in. No need to mess with the capitalization. All things considered I see no good reason to begin documentation or commit messages in lower case given the overwhelming conventions to the contrary that exist in our language.",1442191569

Most students who go to elite colleges pay for what they can afford. While there are exceptions and financial aid is not perfect, the college bubble and loan crisis is largely occurring at for-profit colleges, 3rd tier universities, and the smaller liberal arts college.<p>2. Most students who go to elite colleges are not attempting to optimize their future salary, but are positioning themselves to succeed and obtain prestige in science, law, medicine, politics, or academia. Many graduates of South Dakota School of Mines earn more than the POTUS, and salary optimization is not what many college applicants value.<p>3. You do not and should not go to college primarily to sit and learn in classrooms. You go for the peer connections, professor mentorship, intellectual resources, and industry connections.<p>4. Outside of technology, it is almost impossible to correctly learn and succeed in most intellectual fields without attending college. See: science, medicine, law, politics, literature, the arts. In technology, students who go to adequate universities and take advantage of the resources and connections offered there are merely at an enormous advantage.<p>5.

10213220,comment,10213183,10213183,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Interesting question. I think you would find that the more successful a person is, the bigger their network is. But I believe what you are asking is if that big network is required from the get go. Personally I don&#x27;t believe you need an extremely big network to be successful, but I do believe you need somewhat of a network established.<p>To answer your question thoroughly though, you would need to define what you mean by &quot;successful&quot; and what you mean by &quot;big network&quot;. I think you would find that the size of your network would also be proportionate to the amount of work you need to put into becoming successful. You never know when you may need help with something, what you may need help with, or who you may need help reaching out to. The larger your network of people the easier it is to do those three things.",1442190527

Will you be supported in your choices without being punished for failure? This is as much determined by your peers as the faculty, and it&#x27;s pretty important.

Everybody believed that Aristotle was right about everything for a thousand years during the middle ages. Only academics had copies; they&#x27;d be called heretics for pointing out flaws in revered works. But after the printing press was invented, everybody got copies of Aristotle, Galen, the bible, and everybody <i>saw</i> they disagreed. This contributed to the Renaissance: dissatisfied with Aristotle, Galen, and the bible, people sought new answers.<p>My point is: You can&#x27;t expect people to change their views unless they see things differently. Our task as technologists is to enable different seeing.<p>[0] I&#x27;ll ridicule again computer print-outs and graphs as explanatory devices. Everybody has a feel for how statistics lie. The reason the weather forecast works is the tight-coupling between prediction and verification. Making an appeal-to-computer-print-out to a non-believer is like appealing to another religious text.

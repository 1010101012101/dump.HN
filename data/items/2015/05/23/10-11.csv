From within, the sequence moves from \n  “barely seeing” a pattern several times, then noting it but \n  not perceiving its “cosmic” significance, then using it \n  operationally in several areas, then comes a “grand \n  rotation” in which the pattern becomes the center of a \n  new way of thinking, and finally, it turns into the same \n  kind of inflexible religion that it originally broke away \n  from. From without, as Schopenhauer noted, the new idea \n  is first denounced as the work of the insane, in a few \n  years it is considered obvious and mundane, and finally \n  the original denouncers will claim to have invented it.\n</code></pre>\nSo true, sadly.

9592544,comment,9591739,9591739,0,0,higherpurpose,,,"> <i>A third solution is to migrate to elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), which as far as anyone knows today, is much less vulnerable to descent attacks than the original Diffie-Hellman scheme.  Alas, there’s been a lot of understandable distrust of ECC after the DUAL_EC_DBRG scandal, in which it came out that the NSA backdoored some of NIST’s elliptic-curve-based pseudorandom generators by choosing particular elliptic curves that it knew how handle.<p>But maybe the right lesson to draw is mod-p groups and elliptic-curve groups both seem to be pretty good for cryptography, but the mod-p groups are way less good if everyone is using the same few prime numbers p, and the elliptic-curve groups are way less good if everyone is using the same few elliptic curves.  (A lot of these things do seem pretty predictable with hindsight, but how many did you predict?)</i><p>And that&#x27;s why we need browsers to support curves other than NIST&#x27;s P-256 and such. I know Chrome intents to, and I imagine Firefox isn&#x27;t far behind. What&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s plan for the Edge browser regarding this?

However for major cities like London with tight supply, the flows of real estate investment that followed QE and zero interest rates haven&#x27;t been matched by appropriate levels of home building. As a result affordability and ownership levels have reached historic lows, and many more people are becoming &#x27;unwilling&#x27; renters, only able to service the financing costs of real estate investors. At this stage it becomes rent-seeking and unproductive, in my view, and there ought to be appropriate policy responses from government.",1432376212

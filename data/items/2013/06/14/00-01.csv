For them, it seems the consumer is an afterthought and the technology is key.<p>Windows 8 was an impressive attempt to merge mobile and desktop OSes so that mobile users are no longer second-class citizens and have access to everything desktop users do.  The problem?  <i>Mobile</i> needed fixing, not desktop.  In the push for engineering parsimony, they made the desktop experience worse simply so that it could be shared with mobile.<p>Kinect is a wicked piece of tech.  It&#x27;s just seriously, seriously cool.  But <i>what does it do?</i>  How does Kinect make gaming better?  Outside of that one boxing game, I just don&#x27;t see it.  It makes everything demonstrably worse, like QTEs that work as cinematic finishing moves for bosses in God of War, but are completely pointless in 95% of the games they&#x27;re included in.  Kinect has the same problem: it&#x27;s a really cool solution in search of a problem.<p>Perhaps the best example of this is Clippy, where MS used Bayesian algos to analyze text and offer suggestions.  Again, a really cool little bit of datamining/ML, in <i>1997</i>, no less, and running on the computational equivalent of a potato.  Clippy is a really cool program.  But it was completely pointless.  It solved a problem no one had in a way that pissed off everyone.<p>And really, that&#x27;s Microsoft in a nutshell.",1371171309

IMO they should be optional; 50GB (?) is an infeasibly large download for a lot of places in the world today, but this is not the case everywhere nor forever. Digital distribution allows for more possibilities.<p>The problem with the reduced cost argument is that I really can&#x27;t see cross platform developers pricing the Xbox version lower, so long as they believe it to be the equal to the PS4 version (which might not be the case, the PS4 seems it should have a little more graphics power).

The database could perhaps be made accessible via a URL (&quot;to enable remote workers to view and process NSLs&quot; or some plausible justification) but protected by a weak password.

For some clients, dealing with billing more than a couple times a month can be a pain in the ass. Additionally, you are working on this project as a side gig, so it&#x27;s probably not a lot of hours. In this case I would be fine with taking the whole payment at the end. Just have the client put the money in escrow. The client could still screw you over, but at least you know it won&#x27;t be because of a lack of funds.<p>On the other hand, since this is a side gig you probably aren&#x27;t on the same feast / famine cash flow cycle that most full time freelancers are on. You can probably afford to be picky. So, if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable with the client, just look for another project. For a two week project, I would just do half down and half on completion.<p>I don&#x27;t bother with giving partial work based on the payment schedule. At any given time my client has access to everything I have done. However, most of my clients are also developers (or have other developers working for them,) so we may be committing code to the same repo.<p>I have never been screwed by a client in years of freelancing. I have had clients be way late with payments, but they have always been responsive and sincere when asked about getting a payment. If you are getting screwed, then you need to look at your process for selecting clients.<p>Don&#x27;t get too caught up with it. These payment schemes are meant for managing cash flow and risk. You probably don&#x27;t have to worry so much about cash flow, so your main focus would be the risk.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m not concerned about the risk of losing billable time. My concern is the risk of my business going under. If I lose a few days pay, I&#x27;m grumpy, but this won&#x27;t register on my risk radar. Losing out on a payment sucks, but it&#x27;s a normal part of most businesses. As long as I&#x27;m committed to the long term of my business and learning from my mistakes then I can accept the risk of losing billable time. I might hound Joe down the street for that $10 he never paid me back for the rest of my days, but I can accept losing a few days of billable time because my client went bankrupt and can&#x27;t pay me.

Every time I post a comment on HN speaking negatively of unionized government organizations I get mercilessly down-voted.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because there are a bunch of union thugs reading HN (doubt it) or brainwashed liberals who support unions out of pure indoctrination and without much thought.  The truth is that these organizations are nasty animals with unprecedented reach, power, rights and immunity.  They almost operate under their own laws and it is nearly impossible to go up against them.  Case in point, bad teachers ought to be fired mercilessly without pension and those who abuse children should suffer the same fate.  There was a case here in Los Angeles of a teacher who sprinkled cookies with --don&#x27;t barf-- his own semen and fed them to the kids.  The teacher&#x27;s union actually protected this animal&#x27;s rights for as long as they could.  If the teacher&#x27;s union is that ugly, imagine what police unions and even non-unionized government groups must be like.",1371169651

It&#x27;s a bit different in that rather than drawing boxes and arrows on a canvas you edit a .dot file in your text editor and then have the tool do the layout and rendering.  Having the layout happen automatically leads to some not-so-great looking graphs, but it ends up saving you a lot of time.  Simply putting arbitrary text in nodes and connecting them via labeled edges gives you a lot of flexibility.  When a graph gets too big and unwieldy (20+ nodes), I just split it in two.  I&#x27;ll color a node red to indiciate that there is more information about that node in another .dot file.<p>You do have to learn the .dot syntax, but it&#x27;s nothing too crazy.

In fact they may still be doing the old ECHELON trick in which the US eavesdrops on non-Americans, the rest of the world spies on Americans (among others) - and then everyone swaps the data received.<p>But in the light of the PRISM documents it&#x27;s even more likely than it was before that the NSA <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have the ability to decrypt HTTPS, or at the minimum that the US considers it too important to risk giving it away by using it on routine Top Secret signals intelligence. (And/or maybe too resource-intensive to use for that.) The strongest evidence for this is that we haven&#x27;t heard anything about such a capacity yet from Snowden, Greenwald et al., who all have the full PRISM deck (along with other documents) in their possession and would surely tell us about it if they knew of it. So either 1) the PRISM slides <i>do</i> mention the ability to decrypt SSL or SSH streams but Snowden and the journalists haven&#x27;t picked up on it (not impossible given the apparent incompetence they displayed over &quot;direct access&quot;), 2) it&#x27;s too sensitive to mention in a self-aggrandising Top Secret overview of upstream and &quot;direct collection&quot; Internet signals intelligence, which probably means it&#x27;s not in use (or at least not in regular use) for upstream collection or 3) they really don&#x27;t have it.<p>A supporting reason to think that they don&#x27;t have it, or hardly ever use it, is the apparent emphasis on &quot;direct collection&quot; in the PowerPoint. Why go to the hassle of dancing the frenemy minuet with Google and other fairly-anti-surveillance Silicon Valley firms when you can just get what you want from upstream collection at the apparently more-accommodating telcos? This isn&#x27;t conclusive because even if you could understand all the traffic into and out of someone&#x27;s Facebook account you&#x27;d still like to be able to see the internal state of the account, in particular so that you&#x27;d know what they&#x27;d been doing before the upstream surveillance began. But I think it&#x27;s at least as likely that the whole new focus on direct collection is a workaround for the fact that, thanks to SSL and SSH, upstream collection just isn&#x27;t what it used to be back in the days of ECHELON.<p>As the slide said, You Should Use Both: direct collection to give you access to US-company servers, probably bypassing the HTTPS problem, and upstream access to give you data, probably only unencrypted data (email!), that passes through the US without going to a US-company server.<p>(If you want an exotic alternative theory, you could speculate that the PRISM document is a fake, a limited hangout <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_hangout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_hangout</a> by the US spooks, maybe precisely to direct attention away from their ability to decrypt HTTPS streams.

The kind of innovation involved in this kind of engineering is precisely what the patent system is designed to protect, so that it can be monetized while also disseminated. Without patents these innovations will remain trade secrets and hold back the progress of synthetic biology. Without patents private companies may not be able to justify investment required for innovation. Without patents inability to monetize inventions reduces the overall economic impact (return on investment) for public financing of life sciences, which in turn removes a powerful incentive for government financing of research.<p>For instance, a company finds a compound that fights cancer. The company invents a way to synthesize or purify this compound and sell it. The patent protects the inventor and allows them to recoup the investment. This is widely accepted. Now consider that company engineers an organism that can produce the compound in large bio-reactors. The modified organism - and in particular the engineered DNA sequences - are completely analogous to the chemical manufacturing process, and should be similarly protected.<p>Moreover, consider that the second process may remove a need to use the organic carbon precursors necessary for chemical synthesis (fossil fuels), or eliminates a toxic by-product of chemical synthesis, or is much cheaper and therefore reduces the cost of the compound, benefiting the public. These are real world consequences of synthetic biology protected by the patent system. They don&#x27;t seem so scary to me.",1371168272

It is far more commonly true that the price of a product is dictated by what consumers are willing to pay.  If the PS4 version of game X sells for $59.99, it is more than likely that the Xbox1 version will sell for the same price, because people will perceive both versions as having the same value and be willing to pay the same amount for them both.<p>What Valve does with Steam prices is something different.  New releases still cost roughly the same as traditional DVD copies bought in stores.  Bargains start to appear on titles once they reach an age where a lot of stores stop stocking them. It is true you can get heavily discounted games on Steam, but this is totally unrelated to the lack of a used-game market.  Somebody simply realized that a) A title nobody is selling makes no money and b) gamers will spend money they wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise if they think they&#x27;re getting a deal. Put a and b together and you have a recipe for profit.  This also eliminates demand for used games.  Why buy a skeezy dog-chewed box when you can get a steam-download for the same price or lower?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  If MS builds a curated steam-style store for the Xbox it will undoubtedly be a great thing for many (although not all) gamers.

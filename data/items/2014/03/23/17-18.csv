They want to know whether China is able to use Huawei&#x27;s networking equipment to spy on other countries or conduct cyberwarfare. They want to use information from Huawei to assess China&#x27;s larger plans.

I&#x27;ve been testing this app out in one market (Ohio University) and had &quot;decent&quot; traction. If you were in college what types of things would you look for in an app like this?

In SF the pizza is generally horrible.<p>If you compare cheaper restaurants (i.e. with waiter), then it&#x27;s possible that SF has NY beat (?).

7454186,comment,7452231,7453078,3,0,_delirium,,,"A bit tied up with the IP issue (and maybe a bigger one) is how time accounting works: anything you are required to do as part of teaching your courses, such as actually teaching them and preparing materials for them, must generally be budgeted as &quot;teaching time&quot;. This must usually be paid by the institution&#x27;s own budget (not by grants), and the % teaching time is also a headline figure people use to compare job offers. Things <i>not</i> part of the official teaching duties generally fall into either &quot;research time&quot; (perform experiments, write papers & books, present results) or &quot;service&quot; (serve on committees, review papers, etc.).<p>Currently writing textbooks is classified as &quot;research&quot;, considered entirely the professor&#x27;s own initiative, and therefore done either as part of a regular year&#x27;s research time, or during a sabbatical (which is a period of 100% research time). If you reclassified textbook writing to be part of &quot;teaching&quot;, i.e. your official teaching duties when assigned to teach a course involve not only teaching the course but also writing a textbook for it, you&#x27;d need to budget sufficient time to write the book into the teaching budget. This would typically require either reducing the number of courses the professor teaches per semester, or increasing the % of their time which is budgeted as teaching. Institutions are generally reluctant to do either of those, for a mixture of budgetary reasons (teaching is usually paid internally) and recruiting reasons (if you have an 80% teaching load at your university, you will have trouble recruiting researchers who have offers from 50%-teaching-load institutions, or from corporate research labs).",1395596214

Even now, most of the forays China makes that the USA or Russia feels threatened by are economic overtures (hospital ships to africa, supporting less desirable governments, etc) designed to secure raw materials and achieve economic (not imperialistic) objectives.",1395595869

The post tells us that the much-cited $2 trillion corporate cash hoard has been revised down by half a trillion dollars. That’s kind of interesting, I guess, although it’s striking that the post offers neither a link to the data nor a summary table of pre- and post-revision numbers; I’m supposed to know my way around these numbers, and I can’t figure out exactly which series they’re referring to. (Use FRED!)<p>More to the point, however, what does this downward revision tell us? We’re told that the “whole narrative” is gone; which narrative? Is the notion that profits are high, but investment remains low, no longer borne out by the data? (I’m pretty sure it’s still true.) What is the model that has been refuted?<p>“Neener neener, people have been citing a number that was wrong” is just not helpful. Tell me something meaningful!

Microsoft is still hoovering up every scrap of data they can get. They&#x27;d be stupid not to, as data is insanely powerful. You don&#x27;t need much data at all to do targetted advertising, by the way. Seriously, Google uses at most 1% of the data it gets from you for ad-related reasons, if that. No, Google&#x27;s obsession with data is because data is tremendously powerful at building better products.

By resolving the lower end accounts, you end up with less total users who &#x27;have a problem&#x27;.  That serves a few purposes, including encouraging the customer base to continue using the service, which serves the purpose of funding the rest of the users, including those in the middle.  It also allows you to effectively address the issue with the remaining people who have funds frozen - something difficult to do with all users.<p>I think your overall argument is based on cognitive dissonance.  You&#x27;d like everyone to be paid in full immediately.  That makes perfect sense to me, but it remains they lost funds.  With that fact at hand, you can no longer hold the expectation of everyone being paid in full immediately and the situation of lost funds getting resolved. This makes you angry, and so you lash out with blaming statements which are logically flawed.  Simply put, you are attacking something with an approach that makes no sense.  The reason it makes no sense is because you are having an unresolvable argument with yourself!  Honestly, I see no way of fixing this in a better way than what they have implemented.  To me, that indicates we should extend some amount of trust they&#x27;ll resolve this in a way that gets people&#x27;s money back to them.<p>Your last statement is probably the most valid, but may not be 100% applicable to Vicurex.

The second issue is that if you want it to be a coherent textbook, vs. more of a collection-of-tutorials style anthology, everyone has to be on the same page about the overall approach the textbook is taking, and the chapters have to fit together closely. This is particularly important when later material builds on earlier material, and needs to do so in a way that works pedagogically (as is almost always the case in a CS textbook). Which requires a lot more Skype meetings and usually iteration on the chapters.<p>In our case we tackled it by having three primary &quot;in-house&quot; authors, at the same institution, who decided on the overall approach of the textbook, and outlined the whole thing. At least one of us was then also a co-author on every chapter; external contributors were invited within this context, to write part of a chapter in collaboration with us. This helped integrate the external contributions a bit more easily, and made sure they fit in to the book. And we had only about 8 external contributors. I would definitely <i>not</i> want to go all the way to having completely separate chapters written by different people and try to integrate them, and get the book finished before 2020.<p>The short version is: it&#x27;s a good idea, but integrating multiple people&#x27;s contributions into a coherent textbook is hard. If you take 10 people, and take 1 chapter each from the textbook they would&#x27;ve each written if they were writing the whole thing, the most likely result is not a coherent textbook, but 10 chapters that don&#x27;t really fit together. Not just in the sense that you&#x27;d word things a bit differently, but that you&#x27;d organize the book completely differently and emphasize completely different material, so the result doesn&#x27;t introduce material in a progression that&#x27;s useful to a reader trying to learn the subject.",1395594165

I could understand how they would prevent you getting a particular edition because they effectively purchase new books about every 3 years (depending on the enrollment in the course). Unfortunately, I still ran into a problem like this article speaks about in that one of the professors wrote a book and charged about $25 for their book for the course and made it required.

Not wanting bonuses for bankers who were bailed out by public money has to do with bonus-driven bad decisions being a fundamental cause of the crash that cost everyone else trillions of dollars in wealth, economic growth, unemployment benefits and bailouts.  Look up &quot;moral hazard&quot;, and note that they are up to the same shenanigans that got us into this mess.<p>Furthermore, if the banks are, effectively, government guaranteed, then bankers should be paid as government employees.  Greater pay is for greater skill and risk, their risk is borne by everyone but themselves and as for skill...  So it is only proper (and not &quot;envy&quot;) for the taxpayers to get those bonuses.<p><i>..old money children who have inherited a fortune but seem to have contributed little of value themselves</i><p>This is also a huge economic and social problem, no need to invoke &quot;envy&quot;.  The moneyed elites have started to decouple themselves from the rest of the world.  I went to a prep school in Michigan where this was quite apparent, and scary.  There was also a recent study that warned that this decoupling of the elites from everyone else could lead to (or contribute heavily to) the collapse of civilization [1].  For an artistic rendition, see &quot;Elysium&quot;.  What&#x27;s so scary about that film is not the dystopian outlook, but rather how real a lot of it already feels.<p><i>They&#x27;re envious of highly paid sporting or artistic celebrities who get more salary in a week than most of us make in a year.</i><p>Again, there are good economic arguments for this being a problem.  Pay way in excess of the ability to consume creates a huge overhang in liquidity with which people start to gamble in the international financial casino, creating instability[1]  See also &quot;Giant Pool of Money&quot;[2]<p><i>And so they support punitive rates of tax for those who earn noticeably more than they do</i><p>The rates are not punitive.  They are stabilizing.  Where this rate starts is a good question to which I don&#x27;t have a good answer.<p><i>Unfortunately, what that usually does in practice is hit highly qualified professionals or modestly successful entrepreneurs</i><p>Not according to any statistics I have seen.  References?<p><i>However, the people these punitive taxes don&#x27;t hit are the ones that the popular moneylust craves, because the super-rich are the people who have the flexibility to move their assets and/or themselves around to avoid high-tax environments. Absent serious international co-operation to overcome the naturally competitive tax environment that today&#x27;s globalised society creates, these people will continue to be super-rich no matter what</i><p>So should we not do this because it is wrong or because it won&#x27;t work?  It seems it can&#x27;t work if we don&#x27;t start somewhere.  Certainly finance has globalized, so it seems it is time for enforcement to catch up.  This seems to start happening, see the crackdown on Switzerland as a tax-haven/money-laundering center.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sesync.org/sites/default/files/resources/motesharrei-rivas-kalnay.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sesync.org/sites/default/files/resources/moteshar...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fwirtschaft%2Fhoeness-und-die-finanzkrise-kolumne-von-wolfgang-muenchau-a-958205.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=n&pre...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/t...</a>",1395594087

Specifically, the Senator read the following passages from Dr. Pielke’s written testimony:<p>&quot;&#x27;<i>It is misleading, and just plain incorrect, to claim that disasters associated with hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or droughts have increased on climate timescales either in the United States or globally. Drought has “for the most part, become shorter, less, frequent, and cover a smaller portion\nof the U.S. over the last century”....</i>&#x27;<p>&quot;Footnotes in the testimony attribute the [statement] in quotation marks [...] to the US Climate Change Science Program’s 2008 report on extremes in North America....<p>&quot;...[A]ny reference to the CCSP 2008 report in this context should include not just the sentence highlighted in Dr. Pielke’s testimony but also the sentence that follows immediately in the relevant passage from that document and which relates specifically to the American West. Here are the two sentences in their entirety (<a href=""http://downloads.globalchange.gov/sap/sap3-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://downloads.globalchange.gov/sap/sap3-</a>\n3/Brochure-CCSP-3-3.pdf):<p>&quot;&#x27;<i>Similarly, long-term trends (1925-2003) of hydrologic droughts based on model derived soil moisture and runoff show that droughts have, for the most part, become shorter, less frequent, and cover a smaller portion of the U.S. over the last century (Andreadis and Lettenmaier, 2006). The main exception is the Southwest and parts of the interior of the\nWest, where increased temperature has led to rising drought trends (Groisman et al., 2004; Andreadis and Lettenmaier, 2006).</i>&#x27;&quot;<p>Yes, Pielke argued ¬P by carefully picking a quote immediately next to a statement of P.<p>Extra credit for the mention of &quot;Dr. Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama&quot;, who is the smarmiest goof-ball I&#x27;ve ever heard present.

For instance, in math developing a set of quality exercises is, in my estimation, 2/3 of the effort, so just putting beamer slides in a comb binding is nowhere near enough.<p>At least part of the issue lies in the reward system.  Lesson One of economics is that people do what they are rewarded for doing and at this point most faculty would not get professional credit for being part of an open text development effort (obviously the situation now with printed texts is that people get money, and obviously also people do things for a variety of reasons but generally ..).  Since a quality text takes hundreds of hours of close work by experts, you can&#x27;t be surprised that quality open texts are not thick on the ground.

These can be assigned to VMs for direct access to the NIC, bypassing the hypervisor. AWS, since you used that example, offers instances with this type of direct bypass.<p>Just to pull an example from memory, the ubiquitous Intel 82599 10GbE NIC silicon has up to 128 TX and RX queues in hardware. IIRC, these are bundled in pairs for direct access in virtualized environments, so in principle you could have 64 virtual cores each with their own dedicated physical hardware queue. This is almost certainly what they were talking about. That is the whole point of this feature in Ethernet silicon; it gives cores (virtual or physical) dedicate network hardware off a single NIC.",1442984378

Also, the ability to ignore ads has always existed in previous forms of media:<p>- I can mute my TV, change channels or leave the room when an ad comes on. I can legally record a TV show and fast-forward over the ads.<p>- I can skip over the pages in a magazine where the ads appear. I can clip just the articles I want to read and discard the rest of the magazine.<p>- I can read a book or sleep on the subway and not look up at the ads.<p>Network TV programs are 100% funded by ads, but nobody has ever claimed that I have an ethical obligation to view these ads (or to refrain from watching TV if I don&#x27;t watch the ads).

Students are always late getting their github usernames to me, often with typos, and there are three different dates during term when the class-list changes (last day to enrol, last day to withdraw without incurring a HECS fee, last day to withdraw without academic penalty). If you could do an LTI endpoint, that would be helpful, as most LMSs support LTI. At the moment, we&#x27;re considering running GitLab instead, as that supposedly has LDAP and so can use our university server logins.<p>- using teachers-pet (GitHub&#x27;s command-line tools) for assignments this term, I found an issue where a student made a public fork of their assignment repository. Unfortunately this is problematic, as it could cause students to (accidentally) run into trouble with university plagiarism policies (where putting your work up for others to plagiarise in an assignment is also outlawed).",1442983917

(IANAL, by the way.)  Also relevant to HN readers: a lot of those protections are moot if you&#x27;re acqui-hired: the CA-specific protections about noncompete being unenforceable does not apply if you were an equity holder during an acquisition.  Just an FYI.<p>Also, the default is narrowly defined: if you do it entirely on your own time, with your own equipment, and without using any <i>ideas</i> etc from your employer, you&#x27;re in the clear.<p>Maybe most importantly, you&#x27;re only &quot;clear&quot; in theory; in practice you&#x27;re &#x27;fine&#x27; for exactly as long as your (ex-)employer doesn&#x27;t decide to sue you.<p>Also, keep this in mind when it comes to lawyers and lawsuits: they produce a huge, huge amount of uncertainty.  We&#x27;d like to think of the legal system in this country as a process that consistently produces just outcomes; in practice it&#x27;s noisy and biased against small operations.  You can be 100% morally in the right, and even 100% <i>legally</i> in the right, and still have a bad outcome.  Specifically: I&#x27;ve been told at length that getting &#x27;damages&#x27; when you&#x27;re sued without cause -- that is, having your legal bills paid by the frivolous party -- is an <i>extremely</i> high bar to clear.<p>Furthermore, lawsuits and appeals can drag on for months and years (particularly absent any binding arbitration clauses).

It is vastly more efficient in terms of throughput than the more traditional architectures common in open source. It also lends itself to elegant, compact implementations. I&#x27;ve been using similar architectures for several years now.<p>While I have not benchmarked their particular implementation, my first-hand experience is that these types of implementations are always <i>at least</i> 10x faster on the same hardware than a nominally equivalent open source database engine, so the performance claim is completely believable. One of my longstanding criticisms of open source data infrastructure has always been the very poor operational efficiency at a basic architectural level; many closed source companies have made a good business arbitraging the gross efficiency differences.",1442983051

I recently asked a conductor what the load was: that particular train was 100% oversubscribed: for every butt in a seat, there was another standing. Frankly, the car&#x27;s AC doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to keep pace with the summer heat, either. If there&#x27;s a Giants game … well, it&#x27;s worse. When the Giants parade happened, the line was out the station, snaked through a ton of stanchions, and then stretched more than a block down the road.<p>- rarely, I&#x27;ve seen passengers denied boarding due to load; but I see this much more regularly with bikers. I don&#x27;t know if CalTrain takes this into account in its statistics. (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen some of those folks counted, especially outside SF.)<p>- they got some additional cars, but half-ish of them seem to still be sitting in SF. No idea if they&#x27;re just not ready yet, or what… (also, the cars feel like a blast from the past when you walk into it, compared to the CalTrain ones. They look the same, but yellower… it&#x27;s surreal.)<p>I&#x27;ve wondered if they wouldn&#x27;t fair better if they had an additional (third) track all the way from SF to SJ. Trains could then pass, which I think might let you add more trains to the system. (Given how we&#x27;re always stuck behind a train, I feel like the two-tracks are at capacity, train-wise, and you can only add so many cars before you exceed the platform length.) Not sure there&#x27;s enough room all the way for an additional track, though, so this is probably a crazy idea. I wonder if it wouldn&#x27;t <i>really</i> help with accidents though. (The first quarter of this year, for example, was hell… it was heartbreaking.)<p>Also,<p>> <i>The annual Caltrain passes cost companies either $15,120 or $180 per user—whichever is greater.</i><p>Is that $180 figure correct? CalTrain charges my route $2,148 annually for a pass, and I&#x27;m not even going the full SF to SJ distance. (Granted, that&#x27;s the low figure, so you need the ridership to get it… but still! It&#x27;s a 91% quantity discount, if you get enough people.) (SF to SJ is $2,784 annually.)",1442982401

Why does everyone think that humanities college coursework somehow endows students with something exclusive and rose colored. Humanities courses are enjoyable but too subjective and liberal. Sociology in the U.S. is a joke. Good riddance. Learning a craft is  better guidance towards understanding human experience. Problem solving in a workshop is what the soul needs.",1442981167

Instead of being forced to make an account with a specific company, you can pick from a hopefully-large number of mints, who will be competing on things like fees and the customer experience.  That will hopefully make things suck less.<p>BitCoin solves a lot of problems most people don&#x27;t care about.  Most people don&#x27;t care about Byzentine Generals or trustless transactions or very limited forms of anonymity.  What most people care about are low-cost transactions which don&#x27;t suck.

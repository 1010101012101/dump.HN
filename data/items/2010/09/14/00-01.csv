Heck, I get frustrated with my VIM configuration sometimes because I forget the less used keybindings when I really need them, and need to go spelunking.<p>So sure; if you're willing to trade the up-front investment of time (not insubstantial) Emacs will go far - and the wall is way off on the horizon and someone scribbled ""complexity"" on it.<p>Up-front investment can't be underestimated; there's a reason why things like Textmate (which starts simple, and grows out well) are so popular. Low initial investment, and plenty of ramp, and it works out well until it simply doesn't.<p>That low initial barrier is easier to climb, and while emacs (or even VIM) might have a wall that, when compared to Textmate's, is infinitely far away, textmate will still have fantastic adoption. The wall textmate has is further off then most people are willing to worry about.<p>For <i>most</i> people, a framework, like, say, Django or even Rails offers a wall far enough out that most people don't need to worry about it, but when they hit that wall, they're going to hit it hard, and kinda be mad.",1284425870

I started using it for a site I was making, but had some issues with the Rails authlogic plugin for it (this was almost a year ago though). I never sorted out the problem after a lot of debugging, and then the project ended up on my back burner, where it still lies.<p>It seems like one can get away with the free plan pretty well. But the real issue is that now if either you or they have downtime, you have downtime. I assume they have some good HA practices, but one of the times that I was working on debugging the issue, I was getting 500s.<p>An open source version, especially one that could be easily used with any language, would be awesome.<p>It's possible that the best way to do that would be to essentially clone Janrain open-source-ly and write libraries for that clone. That way most of the work is being done in whatever language it's implemented in, and then to make it work in a new language, you'd just write a simple library integrating with its API, rather than rewriting the whole thing.<p>The advantage is that you'd host it yourself, and so you can take steps to ensure that it stays up.

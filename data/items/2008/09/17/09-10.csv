If there was a site where I could just pay a couple bucks for a customised distro for what I wanted (as its not always the same thing) that just worked, I would absolutely  pay it.<p>I think this kind of approach may also help to increase the adoption rate of linux amongst less technically inclined people too.<p>EDIT - Sorry about the stream of conciousness, just noticed someone supplied a link for SUSE, is there anything similar for debian based systems? Ubuntu undoubtedly is getting the ""lions share"" off attention for linux systems, so is there anything like this for it?",1221644417

What do you mean when you say that income is not a biological trait?<p>FYI, here is a dictionary (M-W Unabridged) definition of heritability:<p><i>the proportion of observed variation in a particular trait (as intelligence) that can be attributed to inherited genetic factors in contrast to environmental ones</i><p>This search...<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22biological+trait+is+a%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22biological+trait+is+a%22</a><p>...returns this interesting hit:<p><i>Learning ability, as any biological trait, is a product of natural selection.

The easiest way to do this is to support action at the state level and only at the federal level for truly national/interstate things.  For instance, federal pollution controls only apply to pollution that crosses state lines.

Overall, I really don't know how these various factors add up. I imagine the result varies widely from place to place, and it's a very difficult empirical question to answer.<p>In fact, ultimately I suspect that the variation from place to place is the exact opposite of what would be optimal.<p>As you say, Detroit auto workers are on the wrong side of every variable. I expect that they also vote for generous benefits. In contrast, a place with a hard working ""get off your ass and get a damn job"" culture will probably vote for stingy unemployment benefits even though generous benefits would not be (locally) harmful.<p>It's a bit of a flaw with a democratic system.<p>However, a proposed solution which addresses both aggregate demand and disincentives would be to make unemployment benefits as unpleasant as possible while still providing monetary benefits. For instance, we could create a social stigma around receiving unemployment benefits. Or we might require unemployed people to submit to weekly adversarial interviews about their job search at 3AM in a cold/hot building with no chairs.",1265384730

Second, there needs to be some structure to browsing - by artist, genre, year, popularity, etc. Presenting a person with a few random tracks when your database has 1000s of them makes it difficult for users to find anything specific.<p>On profiles, the url pattern needs some work. You mention in your blog that you would like bands to say ""check us out on Tune To Us."" However, if they're uploading their songs and want people to hit their profile they'd have to say, ""Check us out at Tune To Us slash profile slash view slash 2934.""

They could (depending on the game, I know this isn't universal) take in more players than they allow at a time, but the quality would drop significantly. Instead, they give you a number, and say ""You are number X in line. Please wait"". While it isn't great, and is very frustrating for players, it is a decent solution.<p>On the other hand, you have Monopoly Street View, which launched with a massively higher number of players than they expected. The end result was a game that was playable for a very, very small group of people, and no one else even knew what was going on.<p>In general, you need to be able to balance the two. There should be a point where you have an absolute cutoff, no more users/requests beyond that, but you should also have a sliding scale.

The non-designers design book is a great choice.  But there are tons of articles across the web on fonts, spacing, coloring, contrast, etc.<p>b) pick out sites that you like (and that people with design sense like), and practice copying them <i>exactly</i>.  If there is some button or styling you do not know how to reproduce, find a photo shop tutorial for how to reproduce it.  As you do this, you build up a toolbox of great design techniques.  Gradually as you get better and learn how to make pretty sites, your old designs will become embarrassingly deficient to your eye.<p>c) as you make sites try to solicit detailed feedback from people who know how to design.<p>Here are some thoughts on specifically why I think your pages do not look so hot:<p>For your home page: <a href=""http://www.welton.it/davidw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.welton.it/davidw/</a><p>The text in your logo needs to be anti-aliased, the edges look jagged.   The alignment and spacing of the menu links are off (the horizontal distance is not consistent).  Again the text is not anti-aliased so it looks jagged.  The spacing between the headers and the text feels off, the header should be closer to the paragraph it represents, not the paragraph above.  The top of your bio pic is not aligned with the top of the paragraph.  Finally, as a general point try and avoid pure black (#000) on pure white (#FFF).  Using slightly grayer font ( #555) softens the page considerably.  Also, don't use the default blue for links, use a better looking color.  The Adwords look very tacky.<p>For Dedasys:  <a href=""http://www.dedasys.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dedasys.com/</a><p>Again, anti-alias the logo.  Try being creative with the font too, maybe download a font set and try making the logo with a more unique font.  Alignment of the menu items looks off, centering them does not work.  The bullet points should be aligned left.  Even better, use a custom designed bullet point rather than the browser default.  The colors for the page overall are terrible.  To get good colors, I often download a really nature picture, then use the eye dropper to pick out a couple colors.  Doesn't always work, but can be quite useful.<p>Overall, great design is not about being glamorous versus simple spare.  Its about getting all the little details right.  The balance, color, alignment, etc.  And it's about adding that extra little touch in a lot of places - the custom icon for bullet points, the creative logo.<p>Getting good just requires a loop of reading/study, practice, and getting feedback.",1265383639

A lot of people say they can't tell when they need to fix their typography, so here's an easy test: paste a chapter of a book you are reading into your template, and see if you can stand to read it there, instead of in the book. The shorter the amount of time you can stand, the worse your typography is.<p>As for colors, first pick a primary color. This'll usually be some pleasing shade of blue, red, or maybe green. Draw some blobs and lines of different size and thickness, and see how the color holds up. Then pick a complimentary background color. For example, when I use red as a primary color, I don't set it against a white background. The red will appear too jarring. Instead, I use a pale cream or very faint yellow. Your background doesn't have to be white, but it should be very light so that your text still shows up well. The point of having an off-white background, though, is that it changes the eye's perception of your primary color, and makes it look like it 'fits'. Test out your primary color again on your background color, and tweak the two.<p>I think, actually, your color choice is already good on your personal site, but it is being marred badly by two things.<p>The first is the navigation. I know that the two leveled effect is on purpose, but what it <i>looks like</i> to the user is that you had one very long navigation bar that wrapped around. The structure of this navigation is poorly conveyed here. The second navigation strip is supposed to be ""under"" David, so to speak, but you don't convey that at all in your design. Here's an extremely quick and dirty example of what might be better: <a href=""http://mkbunday.googlepages.com/2010-02-05-091156_1024x600_scrot.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mkbunday.googlepages.com/2010-02-05-091156_1024x600_s...</a> Note you still wouldn't want ""Padova Chronicles"" taking up two lines.<p>Also, please, please remove the ads from the top of the page. The whole ""above the fold"" thing is overrated... however, above the fold is where the user develops their impression of your site. When I see those ads right in my face, before I've even gotten to read the first paragraph of text my immediate association is with a cheap Yahoo Sites page.<p>You might want to ask yourself how much that ad revenue is really worth. My guess is that it's not exactly a significant portion of your income, and you would be better off removing the ads and having a more favorable professional appearance.<p>Minus the ads, the site looks a lot more favorable already. <a href=""http://mkbunday.googlepages.com/no_ads.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mkbunday.googlepages.com/no_ads.png</a> Look at how front loaded the content is!

Strong contrast between page elements allows the user’s eye to flow from one to another down the page instead of creating a sea of similarity that’s boring and not communicative.
    * Repetition
      Repeat styles down the page for a cohesive feel â€” if you style related elements the same way in one area, continue that trend for other areas for consistency.
    * Alignment
      Everything on the page needs to be visually connected to something else, nothing should be out of place or distinct from all other design elements.

Even if people don't consciously spot it, it will likely feel 'off' to them. You've centered the ""What is Squeezed Books?"" text. Centering looks messy and feels weak.

But you also have ""Write a summary"" styled the same way. That is a call to action. Ideally it should look and act like a button.<p>* Long text: The last comment is very long without paragraph breaks. It looks like user generated content, so you can't do much about it but limit the amount of text displayed and add a ""Read more"". This will make the comment section look more consistent.<p>* The latest comments is a a list of li. That is probably OK but you should definitely lose the bullets.<p>* Play around with font-size, line-height and different fonts. If you want absolute readability, see what the readability bookmarklet is doing. Don't copy blindly because the font-size set by it is pretty large for a normal website.

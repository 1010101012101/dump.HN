I never said web tech was superior.  I'm simply presenting a counter-argument to those that continue to deride web development and claim it can't hold a candle to native apps.  There are endless examples of web applications done right that have compelling experiences and perform on par with native apps.  I've provided a couple of examples in this thread, but there are countless others.  I'm simply claiming web apps can be done right.",1367776767

Yeah, app caching looks nice in theory. Now implement it reliably in practice. 
What will you use in the place of Core Data? Local storage? IndexedDB(with no support in default browser both on iOS and Android)?
How will your replacement for UITableView with reusable cells look like? How about the same combined with UIFetchedResultController? I am not even talking about Core Graphics, animation, etc, etc.
Sorry, but anyone really wanting to advance web tech on mobile should first learn what native SDKs really offer. And then think long and think hard about an answer to this question: ""Should we?Why?"".
How about finding the way finally to serve responsible images on the web instead of fighting wars against native apps?",1367776731

5659133,comment,5658469,5659022,2,0,bmelton,,,"Sorry to have been so troubling.  What I meant to point out, and admittedly did a bad job of, is that I sensed a pattern of ""thoroughly investigating"" both sides of an issue as merely justification for calling someone a dick.  I don't think that holds muster, especially as the same thorough investigation into health care reform led to absolutely zero evidence of why anyone could think it's a bad idea?<p>No matter which you you side on the issue of the Affordable Care Act, there are compelling arguments on both sides of the debate.  I don't see how you can do thorough investigation and come up with the conclusion that it is wholly good, unless you're just happy to categorize everybody in opposition as either dumb, naive, uninformed or just wrong.<p>As for what I think, I did post reasons against in another thread here, which you're of course welcomed to find and/or respond to, but that's just a few of the rather obvious reasons against, and don't necessarily reflect my stance.<p>My real stance is that it's a complicated issue, and both sides have very compelling truths in support of their stance.  The willingness to ignore those compelling truths, even after seeking them out, speaks to a greater bias, in my opinion.<p>You're correct in that perhaps I was overly harsh.  I didn't intend to come off as negatively as my re-reading of my statement affirms that I did, but as there are currently more detractors of Obamacare than supporters, the assertion that the majority simply doesn't have a point at all, smacks of arrogance to me.<p>There is another argument at play, that I think more accurately reflects the author's viewpoint, which is that there are not any good arguments against universal health care as a concept, and has to ignore the specifics of the particular universal health care bill that's been introduced and enacted.<p>As a vague example, I'm betting you'd get pretty high poll numbers for a question that asked ""Would you support a bill that could eliminate crime?"", but would almost certainly be against any particular bill that sought to do exactly that as it would almost certainly entail the restriction of many of our American freedoms.<p>All that said, yes, I am sorry to have posted a response that didn't more accurately measure how I felt, or at least try to temper that response with more supporting evidence, but at the time I was in a hurry.  I don't really see how your response is very different than mine either, so I'll just assume we both responded with too much knee-jerk response and hope to call it a day.<p>For what it's worth, the proverbial straw that tipped me into a frenzy was the line about Reddit - asserting that Reddit has never been excellent, and that despite this one particular case in which it obviously delivered excellence, the author assures us that it will never reach those heights again.  Reddit is a big place, and there are pockets of excellence hidden amongst the mass of everything else.  One man's trash being another man's treasure, the likelihood of a particular subreddit being considered universally good is of course slim, but to assume that this one particular thread is the very best that Reddit ever has, ever can, or ever will do just smacked too much of bullshit to me to let the rest go.",1367776707

The test is not designed to cater and IMO should not cater to a particular culture, it is I believe, designed to be a means of identifying individuals of a skillset.<p>Unfortunately the title of this begins with 'Indian' which suddenly shifts the emphasis on their origin and not that fact that there was alleged cheating.<p>If we were to remove 'Indian' from the title, this post and mine responding to it, wouldn't be all that relevant, which kind of speaks to the sensationalism of the bit and why it is so popular especially in the technical community.<p>So, now what I really want to know is, for those that did submit their code, what they were thinking.

""Achievers"" would obviously be those trying to maximize their karma score. ""Explorers"" would be people reading HN to learn stuff and share knowledge. Out-and-out ""Killers"" are fairly rare on HN since they usually end up marked [dead] (coincidence?), but this category could also include heavy downvoters and people who sidetrack everything into arguments.<p>It's interesting to consider how the design of HN influences these four categories. The scoring of HN allows ""Achievers"" but rewards ""Socializers"" (since to first approximation the more you post and the better known your are the higher your karma), and heavily punish ""Killers"". HN discussions somewhat penalizes ""Explorers"" since even the most knowledgeable responses disappear into the void of old threads after a couple days.

A 0% loan with 2% deflation the equivalent of a 2% real interest rate.  But no one will ever lend money in this situation.  You take on risk, but have no reward.  So the rate of deflation is the minimum real interest rate of any loan in a deflationary currency.<p>In an inflationary currency, people will lend out money at even a negative real rate of interest and effectively lose money on an investment <i>because the alternative is losing even more money by holding cash</i>.  If inflation is 2%, you will consider lending out money at 1% interest (if that is your only choice) because getting 99 cents back on your dollar by investing is better than getting 98 cents back on your dollar by holding cash.<p>Hence, an inflationary currency encourages both lending and borrowing: lenders lose less real money than holding cash, borrowers pay back less real money than they borrow.  A deflationary currency encourages neither: lenders would prefer to hold cash, because it's safer and has decent returns, and borrowers have even higher real interest rates.",1367776291

Not everything the Austrian school preaches is correct, but they do have some valid points that I would expect most smart people to understand.<p>To bring up just a few big ones:<p>Printing money and low interest rate policy of the Fed influences many things other than the simplistic lower interest rate=more spending=more growth formula commonly preached.<p>1) it hurts people with savings. A good example is all the retirees who have saved their whole life and now can't survive on the 1% returns their savings are generating. The Fed is supposedly helping people and business who want to borrow and can do so at low interest rates.. but that does not trickle back to pensioners who should be earning more on their capital if they were not competing with the Fed.<p>2) monetary expansion stimulates the economy unequally across industries and geographic regions. In the models of the academic economic departments, monetary expansion may apply equally to an economy as a whole.. In the real world short run it is a transfer of wealth from one group (wage earners, people who hold cash or low yield bonds) to another group (banks, government contractors, rich people with lots of land and stocks). Some people benefit from low interest rates and new money, but many people are hurt by those same policies.<p>There are quite a few other issues that Austrians seems to be correct on, but these seem to be two of the most obvious to me.",1367775457

It may make packaging and distribution it tad more annoying, but there are tools that can do this, and then you get the benefit of cross-platform adoption -- as well as the option to make it a hosted service, if desired.",1367774569

I think making it look like Windows is probably the worst thing they could do for user comfort; regardless of looks, they'll eventually run in to something that doesn't <i>work</i> like Windows. The experience is less jarring if it looks different from the start. Getting help from technical friends and relatives is <i>definitely</i> easier if it looks, feels and works like a popular distribution.<p>The low-end Linux machines usually aren't <i>cheaper</i> than Windows, and little explanation of the advantages that might matter to that market segment can be found in the marketing materials for such machines. The advantages as I see them are easy access to a large amount of free, safe software through the distribution's repository, and reduced maintenance relative to Windows; it doesn't become slow, get malware, etc... if you just use it without messing with anything.<p>There have been some really puzzling decisions at the high-end too. Dell's Ubuntu developer machine having the lowest available screen resolution comes to mind. Usually, when large computer manufacturers offer professional machines with Linux, it's hard to find them. There's usually a ""customize this model"" page that offers a choice of OS - any of several versions of Windows. The Linux versions are treated as separate products and not listed where the standard models are. People only find them if they're actively looking.<p>It almost seems like these ventures were set up to fail so PC manufacturers and/or Microsoft could say ""Look. We keep trying and nobody buys these things."".",1367774489

That's also why I think all statements along the line we have to create more jobs (in the sense of more work) are ridiculous - why on earth would we desire to have more work to do?<p>The final state - a world without labor where everything is produced by machines - poses no direct problems; all goods are free and everybody is free to do what ever he desires. (There will probably be some indirect problems when billions of people are on holiday everyday, resource constraints, one must probably ensure that no one starts to hoard all kinds of goods reducing the supply for others and surly a thousand things I don't think about but this is probably all manageable.)<p>The real challenge is the change from status quo. The first jobs ceasing to exist or beginning to be unprofitable are naturally the ones comprising of mostly unskilled work and than expanding towards higher and higher required skills. This in turn split the society in two groups - one group still working and one group no longer working or doing unprofitable work. This on its own is not a problem but it is a major problem in connection with the way our society currently works.<p>The economy does not only produce goods to satisfy the demand of the population but although permits laborers to consume these goods by paying them. Consequently we have to either find a way to detangle these both responsibilities of the economy or ensure that all people are able to do a fair share of the remaining work (this is more jobs in the sense of splitting work fairly). The later option is probably the one that is harder to implement because the remaining work will require higher and higher skills and therefore more and more people will not able to do any of this work successfully.",1367774395

Here in India the social norms are a little different - when you talk about classmates, groups of friends, teams and gangs, the failures and successes of one are the failures and successes of all.<p>Some examples:<p>* I had two friends back in college, making us a gang of three. If two of us did well on a particular subject and the third didn't, we'd get called over to his place by his mum, where she'd beg us to teach him and help him out. Home cooked food was a very common and effective bribe.<p>* At our first job interview on campus, we told the interviewer that we were all three joining the company, or none of us would. All three of us got in.<p>* One of us having a girlfriend when the other two didn't meant he was an asshole. Two of us being hitched meant we were obligated to move heaven and earth to help out the third guy.<p>* Each of us would do one third of the coursework, and we'd coach the others on it and learn the rest. This also applied to individual work - we'd just split it in three parts and share all of it.<p>* At the final year project / thesis, we did collude. I was freelancing at the time, and I managed to land an interesting project building a case handling / lifecycle system for a client. I put that design forward as my final year project, and listed the other two as my ""team members"". We all got top marks.<p>Do I regret this? No, not really. These guys were my friends. People called us the Three Musketeers, 
and I sure as hell wasn't going to leave either of them behind. And they would have (and did) the same for me. Would we still do it if it was illegal? I don't know. Maybe.<p>Now, ten years down the line, we've all gone our separate ways. There is still pressure, though. Two of us are married, and if and when we meet the third's parents, we will hang our heads in shame. We didn't help find him a wife.<p>Odd, but true.",1367774341

Two-and-a-half years after the Great Recession officially ended, unemployment has remained above 9% in America. That is only one percentage point better than the country's joblessness three years ago at the depths of the recession.""</i><p>Unemployment has dropped a couple of points since then, but the answer to the question was this, ""Is it over or isn't it?"" And by ""it"" we mean the Recession. As far as I can tell the American economy has run in an unsustainable over utilized state for the last few years. People who had jobs so afraid of losing them that they do anything to keep them, employers so burned by the Great Recession they operate understaffed rather than risk putting precious capital at risk. That is an unsustainable point, workers burn out and businesses leave money on the table because they aren't at full production.<p>What we've seen is that as the job market started opening up there has been a lot of movement, and relaxation on the part of workers such that business is required to hire to keep productivity high. Much more along more 'normal' patterns than we've had over the last 5 years.<p>The lesson for me was that great spasms in the economy result in a lot of irrational behavior (from a market perspective not an individual perspective) which takes a while to work out. The next interesting lesson will be see what the US government learns from these forced budget cuts.

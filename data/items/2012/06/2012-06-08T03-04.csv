""Hey, did you fuck this up?"" is not a question people want to hear all day.<p>Or when it's an internal tool, and your users are a whole bunch of people who work with you?<p>Or when the site that went down is the system you use to invoice your consulting client, and they know you wrote it? Would you be anticipating repeat business?<p>A tiny portion of consideration for other people when you write your error messages can save those other people a great deal of stress. 37Signals wrote a book on that in around 2005 or so:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Defensive-Design-Web-improve-messages/dp/073571410X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Defensive-Design-Web-improve-messages/...</a><p>It's short but it's good. (twss)<p>I think people are getting way too angry about this, and geeks get awfully weird (and often oddly furious) whenever you suggest employing simple social graces, but I also think it's indisputable that OP is absolutely right.<p>And to be fair, I didn't have any apps hosted on Heroku when this took place, so that might even be the reason why I think people are getting too angry about this. Maybe they're right to be mad.<p>""If you had a setup with a hosted machine at Rackspace and the power goes out, you don't expect a custom error. So why would you expect one from Heroku?""<p>Because Heroku's not Rackspace. It's a service, and one thing people like from a service business is good service.<p>I like Heroku, it's awesome, but asking them to take responsibility for their downtime is a reasonable request.",1339127994

Now, as a disclaimer, I am not particularly well-versed in philosophy or anything, so chances are I'm either categorically mistaken or echoing a well-known idea.<p>My thought was this: something that is fundamentally unknowable is also fundamentally irrelevant. Particularly, something only matters if it has some effect. This leads to two cases: it either has an effect, and is therefore measurable, or it does not have an effect and therefore does not matter.<p>Now, this only applies to problems that are <i>fundamentally</i> undecidable--if it's just practical limitations (say technological shortcomings) then they could have an effect that we just can't reasonably trace.<p>But the idea of living in a perfect simulation that behaves <i>just like the universe</i>? From our perspective, that is not different from the just living in the universe <i>at all</i>. Now, if we could measure a difference, it could be important, but lets take the premise that we can't: now thinking about the universe as is or as a simulation of the universe as is is equivalent. So in <i>either</i> case the simpler model--no simulation--is, in essence, correct.<p>The same applies to a religious straw man--the god who does not affect the world at all. If the god just makes the world behave exactly the way it behaves, it may as well be taken out of the picture, mathematically cancelled (in a sense).<p>Anyhow, just a thought.",1339125685

Im not expecting anyone to jump in with both feet (marry on the first date) and would like to work with you on a contract basis with the intent to negotiate a situation that works for both of us should we find that we like working together and share a vision for the company.<p>A little about what Im doing: I believe there is a better way to run consumer-to-consumer marketplaces. We can provide services to simplify shipping, including cross-border shipments, increase buyer security and reduce seller fraud.  Deliver retailer-level product recommendations (Think Amazons You may also be interested in), and more. Our focus is the automotive market due to its size and my experience (I am [or was before this company acquired all my time and money] a fairly serious car guy, as are a few of the investors). I believe there is a large opportunity (and I have quantified it, the numbers are shocking) to improve classifieds seen on forums and message boards.<p>What has been accomplished so far: We have a fairly polished MVP (www.styckyd.com and partners.styckyd.com), a few customers and partners, a handful of others who are interested, a number of executed test marketing campaigns receiving above average CTRs and a current conversion of between 15-20% (This is unsustainable for the long term due to user acquisition cost [~$3] and resulting revenue per user but validates interest and is a viable solution to seed the system). I have previously secured funding for $150k and can secure more (As much as needed, if needed) for future growth and development but Im aiming to grow incrementally for the next few years through customer growth. Were using Rails and a number of gems/OS libraries and are hosted with Engine Yard/Amazon.<p>Some of the challenges youll encounter: Developing solutions to negate all kinds of fraud, from credit cards to buyer and seller scams. Indexing all of the products of an industry from crowd-sourced information  how do we avoid, identify, and consolidate duplicates? How do we seamlessly integrate with a number of third party platforms (vBulletin, Static websites, Vanilla Forums, etc.) where the individuals may not be technical and will have a wide variety of hosting environments? Some of these have working solutions that will need to be improved and some are currently unsolved.<p>A little about me: Im a jack-of-all-trades type. I have spent ten years in B2B marketing and sales. I have successfully sold to middle management in small-to-medium businesses (selling <$10,000 products), and executive management in large (sub F500, selling >$500,000 products) businesses. I have managed industry-leading brands in both the construction and mining industries. I am an adept designer and a novice/intermediate front-end developer, all of the front-end work on the sites has been done by me. Both of these skills can be improved but it wont be our bottleneck in the short term, if it needs to look good and work well from a UI perspective I can make it happen. I am far stronger with front-end design than I am with back-end coding, I make many rookie mistakes (many of which I am not skilled enough to understand yet) but I do intuitively understand how to code and can quickly and easily grasp the structure and scale of the application. Lastly, I do not give up easily. I have been working on this for four years and have gone through many setbacks and overcome even more challenges. The road is long and the walls are high, but not insurmountable. I strive to be the best in everything I do. Although I accept that the path to success is lined with failure, at the end of the day losing isnt an option for me. If I dont (along with others help) make this happen, someone else is going to.<p>Location: Anywhere in Canada/US/Europe. I am based out of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and have established a strong network of investors but Winnipeg is not a tech town. I am looking to either establish a fully distributed team. If you have extensive experience with distributed teams it will be an asset. I am comfortable working with remote teams and can travel when necessary.<p>Payment: As stated in my first paragraph Im looking for someone who can work with me long-term but Im not interested in getting married on the first date. So what I would like to do is work with you on a few small things I need to complete and see how well we work together. This can be done on the side during your evenings or weekends, whenever works for you  it doesnt matter to me.<p>If the above sounds interesting and/or intriguing please get in touch with me. I am happy to discuss further and clarify any details I may have left out. Ideally youre also an auto enthusiasts and either modify cars or race competitively (autocross, Formula V, Spec Miata, track days, whatever). Knowing our customer is vitally important.<p>Thanks for reading,

Still helps for non-HTTPS logins though.<p>Edit 2: ... though maybe if the client-side hash were something strong like bcrypt, it <i>would</i> help in the case of database leaks on HTTPS sites that refuse to use strong hashing on the server side for performance reasons.

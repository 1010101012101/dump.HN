In Quebec for example, there is a tax applied only in Montreal (where the public transport system is almost usable, compared to other North American cities), so gas is always 5-10¢/L more expensive in the city. So people living in poorer rural areas aren&#x27;t affected.<p>Other upside: a lot of gas stations have closed, converted to apartment/condo buildings, which helps to revitalize parts of the city.<p>Downside: I don&#x27;t feel like the provincial government has been investing at all in public transport.

It is pretty valid choice to choose low latency and synchronicity as the top priorities over everything else.

And even more funny when they find that productivity really went down at the end (in the case of one project - after very major feature priorities change - low latency and synchronicity make this much easier, i&#x27;d even say tempting - each sprint for several last sprints before the release, and as result there was nothing to release at all).",1452822883

For example, third-party github plugins that interact with the github system (e.g., setting labels, responding to comments) require &quot;write permissions&quot; which gives those systems &quot;push&quot; access to the underlying repo.  Simply separating the git repository access control from the github UI / issues / pull requests access control system would be very helpful.

The aim is to try to discover information about the person (and vice versa) gradually by following threads of thought and argument in a properly developed context. The style of conversation, and the specific subject matter, should differ between individuals - it should be shaped to their context, and their responses should be shaped to your context, for it to be a valuable use of everyone&#x27;s time.<p>The moment you start to think in terms of &#x27;sets of questions&#x27; or much worse &#x27;best questions&#x27; to ask everyone and anyone who comes in for an interview, you&#x27;ve failed as an interviewer, in my opinion. This just gets more true as the questions become more generalised and abstract, which unfortunately they will tend to in order to filter up into a set of &#x27;standard&#x27; or &#x27;best&#x27; questions you&#x27;ll find online. That&#x27;s not to say you don&#x27;t want topics or themes or ideas of questions to steer the conversation towards, and of course as with anything all the skill is in the delivery, but it&#x27;s a fine line to walk and certainly thinking of an interview in terms of getting through a list of topics or questions is veering towards the wrong side of that line.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to pull questions from these lists, and just rap them off, because it&#x27;s easy and you can convince yourself it&#x27;s a good idea because a lot of them exist on the internet, so there seems to be some consensus that this is a good practice. I&#x27;ve done it myself in the past, and it was a mistake. It&#x27;s lazy, it gives awful results, neither side of the interview will have a good experience or a genuine, valuable human interaction.

I&#x27;ll try to be brief, and you can read more from [1]. I am also very opinionated on this issue, and I will try to be as impartial as I can.<p>Something that&#x27;s really confusing is that the word &quot;fork&quot; actually means at least two different things in the block-size debate context. The first is forking the bitcoin software, and the second is forking of the bitcoin blockchain/network. Bitcoin XT, Hearn&#x27;s project, was the former, a software fork, that would cause a &quot;hard-fork&quot; in the blockchain. Hard-forks in Bitcoin are very dangerous. There has never been an intentional hard-fork of the Bitcoin blockchain since its inception 7 years ago.<p>There&#x27;s a very difficult question of just simply, &quot;how do hard-fork?&quot; A hard-fork would separate the p2p network into two different networks with incompatible rules. A hasty hard-fork could very easily destroy people&#x27;s money and bitcoin all together. Many, including myself, strongly disagree with Bitcoin XT&#x27;s hard-fork procedure.<p>It&#x27;s also not clear that this particular software fork, Bitcoin XT, is better. I&#x27;m not going to go into that issue here as it&#x27;s extremely complicated. We have an alternative solution, segregated witness, which is effectively equivalent to Bitcoin XT&#x27;s short-term plan implemented as a blockchain soft-fork.

For the things where reversing payments is a desired feature, you can build that on top of crypto-currencies (e.g. by using an escrow), so is not like it <i>has</i> to be the wild west. You can get reversible payments or irreversible payments (after confirmation) depending on what the transacting parties need. This flexibility is a good thing.<p>The problem is that this recent change, allows you to claw back your payments without any third party signing off on it, and without your counterpart being able to appeal the claw back. It is also a &quot;feature&quot; most people don&#x27;t know about, because it is the consequence of the low level implementation of something designed to solve another problem altogether. This change existing and being unknown <i>will</i> lead to more fraud vs plain old &quot;irreversible&quot; transactions. And it is strictly worse than being able to claw back your transactions by appealing to the credit card processor, even if under Bitcoin the payment becomes &quot;fully irreversible&quot; earlier than under card processor rules.<p>The argument for why this is not a bug, is that even before this change, a transaction could be reversed via a double spend with a certain probability.

Minimum approximate price for anything is the value of the energy you get by burning it, doing essentially anything else will result in a much higher value product.<p>The costs would be (first order) feedstock + O&M + capital amortized. For a chemical plant, the feedstock is irrelevant not because it&#x27;s cheap compared to the value of the energy you get from burning it but because the difference in price between the product and feedstock swamps the O&M + capital costs. What bigger plants do is decrease O&M and decrease capital (per unit capacity), but they can do nothing to decrease the feedstock price...<p>If a barrel of oil is $50, a barrel of oil equivalent is 6.1 GJ, so if we translate to the weird US units we use it&#x27;s just under 3 cents per kWh if conversion were 100%. In practice efficiency is closer to 45%, which I&#x27;ll call half, so the 2x gets you to an absolute minimum cost of around 6 cents per kWh for oil electricity generation.<p>That&#x27;s including no wear and tear, no capital costs, and no staff to keep an eye on things. This is the absolute thermodynamic floor on the cost of oil based electricity, with the plant size getting bigger at best driving the price to 6 cents as O&M and capital costs are driven to a smaller percentage of the total costs (i.e. O&M + fuel).<p>For comparison, look at figure 44 of this report:<p><a href=""http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/08/f25/2014-Wind-Technologies-Market-Report-8.7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/08/f25/2014-Wind-Tec...</a><p>and you can see that the median marginal cost (i.e. operations and maintenance) of wind power is ~0.8 cents per kWh ($8/MWh).<p>So I stand by my claim that the marginal cost of wind power is much lower than the marginal cost floor for oil base electricity.

That way the user can surf freely and only hit the server when it needs to save something (which allows the app to scale).<p>The problem is that I don&#x27;t want the user to have to authenticate twice.

However I can’t find a single social provider that does this!<p>I scoured the web and Stack Overflow and can’t find a good discussion about the security of sharing tokens (all they say is to pass it over SSL).  So the best I could come up with is to authenticate implicitly on the front end and pass the client access token to the server.  This seems safer to me than sharing the explicit access token from the server to the client in the outside world.<p>Token sharing from client to server presents several security issues, because the server has to trust that the token belongs to the current user.  It completely negates ever using the explicit flow, because most users are on mobile these days.  The best the server can do is ask the social provider if the token’s app id matches the server’s app id, to prevent the confused deputy problem:<p><a href=""http://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/connectivity-dev/google-oauth-security-confused-deputy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/connectivity-dev/google-oauth-...</a><p><a href=""http://technotes.iangreenleaf.com/posts/closing-a-nasty-security-hole-in-oauth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technotes.iangreenleaf.com/posts/closing-a-nasty-secu...</a><p>Believe it or not, several prominent social providers don’t even provide a token validation endpoint!<p>This whole experience has left me wary of OAuth 2 and I am concerned that it may not even be able to fulfill my very common use case.

Thus no matter what currency one comes up with, ultimately few handful of wealthy individuals or governments can completely control its production as well as evolution. In Bitcoin case, few governments or individuals can own 95% of the production capacity because that&#x27;s the proportion of wealth/power they own.

There&#x27;s still tons of other unexplored space on the Bitcoin chain itself, not even counting altcoins - there&#x27;s a lot of flexibility with Bitcoin script, and new opcodes are being added (OP_CLTV got turned on very recently).<p>Some of these allow you to develop altcoins that are backed by Bitcoin, called sidechains (see Elements Alpha for an example [1]). There&#x27;s other clever ways to use the scripting system to do fancy things that could help lower the cost of transactions, like the Lightning network [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://lightning.network/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lightning.network/</a>",1452819701

What if far more people prefer a more simple, minimalistic interface than an ultra-customizeable interface with myriad custom actions and events. I&#x27;ve always appreciated software that deliberately keeps things simple (Basecamp and Workflowly come to mind). It sounds like these people want a full blown Jira/Stash installation.",1452819676

A rational decision: pay a tiny portion of your 200k to someone else to build the prototype. Do the same to try to sell it. There should be a ton of programmers out there just as good as you are that can deliver a good product. Meanwhile, running this on-the-side-startup might take some of the emotional pressure off, give you fresh air and motivation. I am talking from experience, now I have two companies: the consultancy work (which mostly I dislike but pays the bills) and the startup that takes a little of my time to steer, it&#x27;s fully staffed, self-funded and it&#x27;s walking into its 3rd year of profits (which are now enough to pay half the bills). Think rational and controlled transition, not jumping into the void. Also, I did get to program some of the code on the startup so it was fun and distracting!",1452819657

It&#x27;s great as a motivator, but be sure you&#x27;re in a good enough mental shape to handle both your commitments and the eventual slip-ups.<p>That said, I also have to praise Beeminder for having a great tool with lots of little nice features (I&#x27;m particularly fond of the graph aesthetics), amazing and responsive support (and proactive - I screwed something up once, they fixed it for me pretty much immediately and sent tips on how to avoid this happening again), and wrote a lot of interesting things on akrasia.<p>EDIT:<p>To &#x27;dreeves - long time ago I shared this experience over at SlateStarCodex, and I missed your reply then. Referring to it, and that you&#x27;re &quot;extremely averse to people paying money to Beeminder that they don’t feel was worth it&quot; - no, I feel it was totally worth it, even if it contributed a bit to one of my biggest stress episodes in my lifetime. I&#x27;m not scared of Beeminder, I&#x27;m scared of myself. I treat it as a combat scar in battle against akrasia :). So thanks for your kind refund offer, but a) you&#x27;re totally entitled to the money, and b) it was long time ago :).<p>Oh, and thanks for supporting SSC :).<p>And, to everyone else - did I tell you already that Beeminder people are really great, friendly and radiate honesty in a way that&#x27;s pretty much unseen in this industry? I do very much recommend the service despite the fact that, by my own fault, I managed to cut myself with it.",1452819646

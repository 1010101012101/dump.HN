Instead, economics is governed by laws created by our society. And what we think of as &quot;free market&quot; is really just norms of trade which are created by our society. There is no reason why the bulk of the billions taken-in by WalMart should go to the Walton family while their employees live on food-stamps - that is just a legal arrangement. And there is no reason why the Walton family should continue to be allowed to use offshore corporations to loan themselves money to run all their WalMart stores - that is just a legal arrangement which allows them to avoid taxes and hide their billions offshore. Really, when you start to  closely examine &quot;free market&quot;, you come to realize that is it a chimera made real by those with power and money.",1451779128

After all, RabbitMQ pretends to be multi-master; but if you set up clients to treat a single node (of several) as a master, the other nodes will be reduced to being dumb backup nodes.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget that clients don&#x27;t decide which node owns a queue — it&#x27;s owned by the node where it&#x27;s first created. Being consistent about always talking to the correct node, and keeping track of which node owns the master replica of any given queue, puts a complicating burden on both clients and the system administrator.<p>You can run RabbitMQ without any partition handling, but that means the ops staff needs to wake up in the middle of the night to handle downtime.

I learned coding to start my own startup, it&#x27;s the only way I&#x27;d ever be able to afford a prototype..<p>But I think Bernie said it best: &quot;NOBODY working 40 hours per week should be living in poverty&quot; -- there is no reason for this, in fact it makes that person a slave to whoever is paying them sub-par wages, they have to work whether they want to or not, it&#x27;s not a choice, it&#x27;s enslavement, they stop and they lose their apartment, and food. If the lowest 40 hour/weekers earned enough to put money away, and not worry about living paycheck to paycheck, then it wouldn&#x27;t be such a problem. Also the fact is -- the poor spend the most money per dollar - meaning the more money the have to spend, the more money goes directly back into the local economies.<p>This along with increased tech advances that wipe away the need for some employees and 40% of the workforce(estimated) by 2040, a guaranteed basic income isn&#x27;t just a good idea - it is crucial to our economy, and if it doesn&#x27;t happen there WILL come a day when American&#x27;s demand it, and pick up a gun to fight for it, I&#x27;m not sure when or what the tipping point will be, but it&#x27;s coming someday.",1451779032

The easiest way to test if an idea is a good one is to go do it, so he did, and it turned out it was, and that led to profit.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to attribute Machiavellian scheming to PG.  There are some other people in Silicon Valley that will take a position and then influence public opinion to make that position come true, but it&#x27;s pretty rare, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the case here.

I have a friend that, since she&#x27;s become relatively well known and travels a lot, gets a lot of those recruiting pitches. Has that made her happier? Nope: It&#x27;s not hard to see the grass greener on the other side when everyone around you is doing their best to make things seem amazing. She&#x27;s never sat in the same place for more than a year in the last 6, so she&#x27;s not really had time to leave her mark anywhere. Not one major work accomplishment in years.

A few jobs ago, I attended a 15 year celebration. 15! Straight out of school, to architect, without having ever worked anywhere else. Management never figured out that those 15+ year tenures were the reason many new senior hires were coming in and leaving quickly: Why would you work at a place that has such a long standing, very tenured network of people that trust each other more than anyone new, and that they&#x27;ll never leave?

People don&#x27;t lose their job? Called their bluff.<p>> Walmart employees are not compelled to work for Walmart; the employment contract is agreed upon voluntarily by both parties. The employees know how much they will be paid and agree to accept the terms. Walmart is operating within the legal employment framework set up by the government, including the welfare state and the minimum wage.<p>Yes. And if you think everything is fine the way they are now, then don&#x27;t change a thing.<p>> That will not change by raising the minimum wage. Rather, Walmart will simply add automation and reduce its employment.<p>Sounds great to me. You&#x27;re basically arguing that not having minimum wage is actually holding back progress.<p>> That is, their skills are not worth the minimum amount an employer is allowed to pay, so they will not be able to find a job. Ever. That person will be a permanent liability of the State.<p>If an economy can produce the same amount of wealth with much less workforce/work hours than today, then why shouldn&#x27;t it? Sounds great if you ask me. (And if that&#x27;s not possible, just hire more people, it&#x27;s apparently worth it, problem solved.)<p>&quot;Minimum amount&quot; is in this case &quot;amount needed to reasonably survive&quot;, ie. not need extra welfare. If you can&#x27;t produce enough value that you can&#x27;t even justify being paid to &quot;reasonably survive&quot; then yes you need help.<p>Okay, so I&#x27;m no economist, but it sounds like you&#x27;re arguing that not having minimum wage is in itself a socialist measure. In other words, paying people something, anything, is better for the poor than paying them nothing. The only reason to pay the employees anything at all is to &quot;help the poor&quot;, because their work is not really needed anyway (their work is worth that little).<p>To follow that line of reasoning, from a capitalistic viewpoint, it would thus be wise to raise the minimum wage. If people are being paid to do work that&#x27;s not actually worth it (ie. subsidized via welfare), then don&#x27;t. I seriously don&#x27;t understand why capitalistic Americans defend that point of view. Why should the state/government subsidize effectively worthless labor?<p>What I&#x27;m doing is &quot;calling the bluff&quot;. People won&#x27;t get hired? That&#x27;s fine, the work they were doing is practically worthless anyway, and I&#x27;m certainly not for subsidizing that. However, I think people actually will be hired anyway. Because their work is not worthless. I think the only reason people are being paid so little is not because of the &quot;worth&quot; of the work they&#x27;re doing, but because the market allows it.<p>I don&#x27;t know how that happened, perhaps because the big cooperations have too much power, perhaps it&#x27;s just inevitable in a free market. But I do not support subsidizing labor, and I don&#x27;t buy the argument that you have to. The money is there, the value of their work is there, there&#x27;s no problem paying people more, they just don&#x27;t want to, and luckily for them they don&#x27;t need to either. And as long as everyone plays along, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going to stay.<p>Sometime in the future I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be able to produce enormous amounts of wealth with minimum man power (re: automation). What will everyone do then? That&#x27;s up for debate, but it looks like the best bet is putting everyone on universal basic income. And that&#x27;s not a problem, because the wealth is there, the &quot;problem&quot; is that no one needs to do anything to produce it. I&#x27;m sure our future selves will find a fix. (If not, then that sounds like a base line for a revolution. Let&#x27;s hope that&#x27;s not needed.)<p>In the meantime, redistribute some of the wealth by raising the minimum wage.

It is rather insulting to retroactively designate them by a country name that didn&#x27;t exist when this was their lands.<p>Indigenous Peoples: Most Americans hear that and think you mean tribes in some other part of the world, not tribes native to this continent.<p>I don&#x27;t think we have a really good expression for the entire group of many different tribal peoples who are descended from the people who were here well before Europeans discovered this continent and ....lots of events later a country called The United States of America was formed. Even the term &quot;America&quot; as a means to refer to citizens of the U.S.A. is problematic when speaking on the Internet because Canadians and people living in South America and Central America (etc) feel like we are appropriating a term that could also refer to them.<p>The arrogance of mainstream culture in the U.S. is incredible and galling and I am not fond of it.

Altough the concentration on <i>income</i> inequality overall is perplexing to me.<p>Income can be measured and is emotive ( I earn X but my cousin earns 10X ), yet I think concentrating on this metric is obscuring some bigger issues. You do touch on them in your counterpoint.<p>Karl Marx in Das Kapital explains the situation post Industrial Revolution and prior to the World Wars. The landlords conspired with the factory owners to keep rents high and wages low so that workers had little ability to move or leave.<p>This lack of freedom in a self determination sense is creeping back into Western economies. Mortgages and rents are so high that workers spend most of their wage paying that.<p>So never mind that middle class income equality is 17% lower than middle class income equality 1980. House prices and rents have climbed more than enough even if &#x27;equality&#x27; had persisted. ( Also prices for the very rich have increased too. )<p>But instead of a landlord class and factory manager class conspiring the prices have risen via market forces and lax monetary policy and the relabeling of debt as &#x27;credit&#x27;<p>Another factor is opportunity equality. Meritocricy has greatly reduced since 1980, and is acutely poor now. Entry into elite jobs like CEOs, the Media Class, <i>(cough)</i> VCs and Private Equity firms are chosen from just a few streams. Harvard, Wharton, Ivy League in the States and moneyed private school in Europe. From outside those circles it is a struggle to join.<p>Paul touched on WW2, but I would go further and say both WW1 and WW2 were the genesis of a burst of meritocracy unleashed by mass death in Europe at the same time as vast strides in technology.<p>Getting a good job was easy in 1960 because everyone had died in 1915 - 1945 and there were many new classes of job.<p>These days, people are working and living longer and it is harder to get to the top... your boss didn&#x27;t die in battle, you&#x27;ll have to wait.",1451778030

Take the two most well-known cases for instance, Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.<p>Trayvon Martin assaulted Zimmerman unilaterally (Zimmerman never threw a punch,) had him in a ground-and-pound position and was bashing the back of Zimmerman&#x27;s head onto the sidewalk while Zimmerman repeatedly screamed for help. If any white seventeen-year-old had done the same thing there would be zero outcry about recognizing the need for self-defense on the part of the neighborhood watchman.  If a white kid in a hoodie was walking behind houses in the rain and looking into windows, nobody would label it &quot;profiling&quot; when a neighborhood watch leader called the police, since that&#x27;s obviously questionable behavior.<p>Michael Brown had just committed robbery at a convenience store, then he assaulted a cop who asked him to walk on the sidewalk, then tried to wrestle away the cop&#x27;s gun.  Forensics shows Michael Brown didn&#x27;t have his &quot;hands up&quot; when he was shot, meaning the witnesses all lied about the situation.  Again, if a white teenager had committed strongarmed robbery and proceeded to try to grab a cops gun there would be literally zero sympathy or outcry when he was shot in self-defense by the cop.  People would basically just call the dead teenager &quot;trailer-trash,&quot; or something equally derogatory and move on.<p>The only factor race plays in <i>any of this</i> is that we would never have even discussed or heard of these absurd cases had the so-called &quot;victims&quot; not been black.  If race enters into the narrative at all it&#x27;s in the form of black privilege / supremacy, in that black communities seem to believe these incredibly violent assaults are fine and don&#x27;t merit self-defense for some reason, solely due to skin color.<p>More accurately, it&#x27;s all hyped up and manufactured by the media to stoke division because nothing sells ad space like impassioned controversy.",1451777956

That&#x27;d work for the overwhelming majority of the frames.<p>Sure, but that uses a lot of memory, and initial pageload is going to be really slow. Especially when you consider you need to generate mipmaps if it&#x27;s really high resolution, or else blow out your GPU&#x27;s L1/L2 cache in FS execution.<p>> Doesn&#x27;t that approach win over re-rendering all the text from a font-atlas every frame?<p>Not significantly, in my experience. Assume, in the simple case, that you&#x27;re just rendering a bunch of text with no overlap. In that case, the only thing that tiles buy you over rerendering all the text from an atlas is decreased vertex count. You&#x27;re still touching the same number of pixels in the FS and ROP units either way: you just do so with more vertices in the texture atlas case and fewer vertices in the tiling case. Now consider that creating and maintaining the tiles has costs over maintaining the glyph atlas (which you have to do either way): you have the memory of the tiles, the overhead of creating and switching FBOs, lots of little textures to keep around (which in naive implementations results in tons of state changes), and extra draw calls to render the tiles after rendering the content.<p>> why do browser rendering engines use tiles?<p>Mostly because it was an easy way to fit GPU-accelerated panning and zooming into the existing, originally CPU-based, rendering architectures that browser engines used (and still largely use). Tiling was popularized by Mobile Safari on the iPhone in 2007 as an easy way to avoid repainting the entire page on the CPU every frame when the user performed touch gestures.

I don&#x27;t know anyone who understands enough to actually have a discussion (e.g. isn&#x27;t some back to nature hippy) and seriously thinks we should attempt to minimise the opportunities to create new wealth. Everyone I know who argues for reduced economic inequality favours increased minimum wages and/or redistributive mechanisms (income/wealth tax). I don&#x27;t know if Graham has encountered people who seriously argue against permitting opportunities to create wealth, or just thinks those people exist, or has some sort of anti-redistribution agenda (which would function to reduce the potential gains that could accrue to startup founders... though not significantly).<p>I was particularly struck by this suggestion:<p>&quot;And if there are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying the government for anti-competitive regulations or tax loopholes, then let&#x27;s stop them. Not because it&#x27;s causing economic inequality, but because it&#x27;s stealing.&quot;<p>Stealing is an extremely imprecise and emotive word, and he makes no effort to clarify. Which is usually what you do when you want a lot of people to feel like they agree with your arguments even when they might not if you went into detail. But the weirder part of the statement (ignoring the fairly broad &#x27;tricking consumers&#x27;, which would include most people who market their products) is that he specifically identifies tax avoidance (which I&#x27;d argue ISN&#x27;T stealing) as something we should eliminate... &quot;not because it&#x27;s causing economic inequality, but because it&#x27;s stealing&quot;, even though the main reason we have tax AT ALL (and hence laws around when you do/don&#x27;t need to pay it) is to reduce economic inequality!<p>So... all our existing tax laws, and their economic-inequality-reducing redistributive effects, are wise and good and infractions should be rigorously prosecuted because they&#x27;d amount to stealing. But any NEW tax laws that might increase the redistribution of wealth to increase economic-equality would be bad and misguided?

I&#x27;ll have to read more about which of those are adjusted for inflation and how all that measurement actually works, but for now I&#x27;d like to make a few points that might be relevant:<p>- There&#x27;s not much consideration <i>why</i> productivity has increased. If I had to guess a significant part is because executives hired analysts and planners to increase productivity, not just because better technology had that side effect. The incentive to do this is presumably that more productivity means better margins for the company. I can understand the argument that the workers deserve a bigger share of the rewards than they have gotten, but there is also a share deserved by the executives and analysts who were involved. And legally you can&#x27;t really say that anyone is <i>entitled</i> to a share, which I guess means that in our society the balance comes down to ethics and morals.<p>- I think this point is made elsewhere, but there are a lot of things you can do with a &quot;middle-class&quot; income these days that were simply not possible when the wage stagnation started. Could it be the case that even if wage numbers don&#x27;t track productivity, there is some balancing elsewhere that means actual quality of life does increase with productivity?<p>I&#x27;d like to hear peoples&#x27; thoughts, if these ideas are not full of trivial fallacies (which may very well be the case as I am not very knowledgeable about economic stuff).",1451776877

The poor in America are significantly better off than the wealthy were not very long ago, in most material senses, as has been repeatedly pointed out. So what if they don&#x27;t get <i>as good</i> health care or education or whatever as some of their neighbors; it&#x27;s still better than they would have had. The problem is that relative wealth, inequality, <i>is</i> power. It always has been, and it always will be.[2] (Admittedly, in other societies, wealth isn&#x27;t the only power. But with the decline of the church and the significant lack of both feudal aristocracy and totalitarian[3] governments, wealth is really the only power left.)<p>So, here&#x27;s a question: is it proper for a vanishingly small segment of society to be able to establish and maintain power over the vast majority? Me, I&#x27;ve got no idea. Don&#x27;t really care, either. Because a better question is: is it a good idea? And I think the verdict of history there is a pretty solid Nope.<p>Are you unhappy with the Koch brothers&#x27; political views? That&#x27;s another stupid question; their specific desires are pretty much irrelevant. Much more important is how you feel about how they go about expressing and supporting their views. When reading PG&#x27;s or this article, remember that Charles&#x27; and David&#x27;s father was very much a start-up entrepreneur. Their grandfather was a Dutch immigrant and printer and Fred was <i>exactly</i> the kind of person PG is talking about in his essay. Now, you can can go on about &quot;limiting corruption in politics&quot;, but keep in mind that the Koch brothers are apparently planning on putting something like a trillion dollars into the 2016 election; it&#x27;s hard to perceive anything but that their views will always matter more than yours.<p>Inequality in wealth and power is not even a new thing in this country; I&#x27;m given to understand that the state now is at or approaching levels from the gilded age, but not exceeding them. What is new, is that for a time in this country we <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have wild inequality. Here&#x27;s what Paul has to say about that:<p>&quot;<i>I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries that don&#x27;t choose something worse. We had a 40 year stretch in the middle of the 20th century that convinced some people otherwise. But as I explained in The Refragmentation, that was an anomaly—a unique combination of circumstances that compressed American society not just economically but culturally too.</i>&quot;<p>(Personally, I think that the cultural compression that Paul fears so much is somewhat overblown. But then, I grew up in the &#x27;70s in Amarillo, TX (not far from the Koch&#x27;s Quanah, weirdly) and rather fortunately had the library at WTSU about 45 minutes south in Canyon.)<p>The thing that bothers me most: All of those fancy technologies that PG emphasizes, those that some commentors here are happy to trade 45 years of real wage growth for, had their direct roots in that brief period of weird equality. What happens next? What happens after AirBnB puts all the hotels out of business and we&#x27;re all staying in each other&#x27;s spare bedrooms on trips? What happens after Uber has killed off all the taxi companies in the world and replaced them with spare-time drivers? Do things still keep getting better and better? Sure, my nifty new Galaxy Note is better than my old land-line, but exactly how much better is an iPhone6 compared to a 5?<p>Or, ultimately, do Larry Ellison&#x27;s sons, Charles and David, decide they don&#x27;t want to deal with all of this bullshit and start throwing their weight around Silicon Valley?<p>And when they do, what are you going to do about it?<p>[1] <i>The Story of Philosophy</i>, by Will Durant, if you&#x27;re interested. In fact, I&#x27;m in the middle of the chapter on Nietzsche; one of the best comments in this very well-written and quite good book is a footnote following a quote from Nietzsche regarding how excesses in the behavior of the übermensch will be restrained by morality: something to the effect of &quot;How did that get back in here?&quot;<p>In any case, PG&#x27;s comments like, &quot;<i>Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven. Whatever their other flaws, laziness is usually not one of them</i>&quot; (<i>Laziness</i> isn&#x27;t one of the flaws of that single mother working three jobs, either.) or &quot;<i>Louis Brandeis said &#x27;We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can&#x27;t have both.&#x27; That sounds plausible.

Saying we should not be emotional is easy to say when it&#x27;s your company.<p>The real issue is if designers (novice or experienced) feel like their design abilities are being questioned (and so their position threatened). And so the real trick is to make sure there is a clear understanding of what direction the critique is aimed.<p>If there is any confusion you ned up with designers who take critique of the discussed solution with a critique of them as designers. And so I have always tried to make two things clear to the designers I had.<p>1) They are there because they are good enough.

The fruits of your labor only exist within an organized society. There&#x27;s a reason that entrepreneurs prefer not just certain countries but certain places in certain countries for building companies: where you work, who you&#x27;re near, what infrastructure is around, what customers are around, what regulatory frameworks are in place and what laws are interpreted in what ways, etc. all contribute to a more or less successful company. And those things can in large part be traced to good or bad governance.<p>What would a fair rent in Galt&#x27;s Gulch be? What should John Galt have charged the other strikers for not only collective defense like the distortion field, but for the community existing? For the <i>opportunity</i> to live in such a society? If the US government collapse didn&#x27;t happen, the number of people Galt would have wanted to live there would have been fairly high, and their willingness to pay, once they knew what he was up to, would also have been high. And he had a genuinely good product, and every right to eject people from Galt&#x27;s Gulch at gunpoint.<p>Taxes up to that point are certainly fair. Whether governments as currently implemented are the right entities to collect those taxes is a question (though, by no means interpret me as advocating a Randian anarcho-capitalism just because I used Galt&#x27;s Gulch as an example!), but your labor is fruitful <i>within a society</i>, and that society certainly has the right to charge you for it, or demand, at gunpoint if necessary, that you stop taking advantage of what they provide for free. (You always have the right to opt out of taxes if you opt out of the taxing society, as Roger Ver did.)<p>For a less fictional valley: how much does the government fund Bay Area universities in the form of research grants? And how much did the tech industry gain from that, and what would a fair price for access to that have been? Imagine a parallel universe where Stanford and Berkeley never got a penny of government funds.

Time.com did a piece that has some very nice mentions about the app: <a href=""http://time.com/4137223/apple-tv-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://time.com/4137223/apple-tv-apps/</a><p>- I built the Macronutrient Tracker for On The Regimen: <a href=""http://www.ontheregimen.com/macros"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ontheregimen.com/macros</a><p>- Before I started freelancing I worked on the Fitocracy iOS app: <a href=""https://www.fitocracy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fitocracy.com/</a><p>- In my down time I&#x27;ve been working on Swerver, a Swift MVC web framework: <a href=""https://github.com/jparishy/swerver/tree/develop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jparishy/swerver/tree/develop</a><p>- And in the past I&#x27;ve built RunSwiftLang.com and TestAPNS.com as free tools for helping developers learn and test their apps.<p>I&#x27;m available starting in January for new projects; if you&#x27;re looking for a great dev to build your next iOS app get in touch.<p>You can reach me at julius@jaymobile.io.",1451775662

I think everyone in the audience was altogether not quite sure where/why python 3000 was coming and so willing to patiently listen to what the master had to say about all of it.<p>Guido&#x27;s reasoning seemed to be that since a bunch of junior devs at google couldn&#x27;t refactor their print statements into logging statements the print statement had to go.<p>I don&#x27;t seem to have this issue: for me the print statement is 99% used as a debugging tool. When I&#x27;m debugging I pepper my code with print statements until it tells me what is going wrong. So two extra parens every time i do this just seems unreasonable to me. Excuse my whining, but there it is.<p>I was also at europython in 2007 when Guido once again went over the changes being wrought by python 3. This time when he got to the print statement I let out a loud &quot;BOO!&quot; Guido was somewhat surprised and remarked: &quot;well no-one said anything about this when I announced it at last year&#x27;s europython!&quot;<p>Doh.",1451775650

Emanuel appears to have taken on powerful constituencies in Chicago politics, with various unions being the most notable, and seems to have suffered for doing so.<p>Chicago has a major, union-fueled municipal pension crisis brewing: <a href=""http://www.wbez.org/news/experts-say-chicago-has-public-pension-system-set-fail-109329"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wbez.org/news/experts-say-chicago-has-public-pens...</a>.

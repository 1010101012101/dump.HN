8409899,comment,8408452,8409787,1,0,thinkpad20,,,"The &quot;String problem&quot; is definitely one of the most unfortunate parts of Haskell. Using a linked list of chars for a string is just laughable from a performance and resources standpoint. The good news is that the problem <i>should</i> be solved now: we have Data.Text for unicode strings, and Data.ByteString for binary/ASCII/UTF-8 strings. Both are very efficient and implement a robust API for common string operations. The bad news is that there are still far too many libraries that use the old crummy data type for strings, including much of the Prelude. And, I guess in the interest of simplicity, many beginner tutorials tend to use String as well. This is quite unfortunate, but it does seem to be changing: Aeson uses Data.Text, the ClassyPrelude ditches String almost entirely (keeping it for Show only), and in general most modern libraries avoid String.<p>Hopefully HXT will be updated to use modern string types soon. In the meantime, I believe that xml-conduit (<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-conduit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-conduit</a>) might be what is desired.",1412441977

8409890,comment,8409624,8409624,2,0,makeramen,,,"And C# can&#x27;t (directly) run on anything not built by Microsoft. For those of us focused on shipping products to cross platform users, there are handfuls of languages better than C# in that regard. There are things every language does poorly and well, but you also don&#x27;t see us making whycsharpsucks websites because we&#x27;re probably too busy building things.<p>I just don&#x27;t see the need for this kind of negativity. If a language wasn&#x27;t designed for a certain way of using annotations (or any feature), maybe another method should be tried to get similar results. It may not be ideal and may not fit the paradigms of what you&#x27;re used to, but it&#x27;s a completely different language for heaven&#x27;s sake.<p>It&#x27;s like asking why a Honda Accord isn&#x27;t faster than a Lamborghini...

And it&#x27;s a weird and manipulative writing style to tell the reader &quot;this is how you need to do it&quot; followed by examples that don&#x27;t even compile - simply to include some oh so bad compiler errors.<p>Why does the author seem surprised when his code doesn&#x27;t compile after adding a non-optional parameter? It&#x27;s arguable  whether parameters should be optional by default or mandatory by default. Not really knowing much about c# I guess anything besides primitives will be `null`, which doesn&#x27;t seem like you gain much.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I have ever seen annotation used like in this `whenType` example. Besides that the whole approach looks suspiciously complex (why not just create `@DefaultPriority` which you can add to your type?), annotations are supposed to be simple meta data and you shouldn&#x27;t be trying to implement some kind of logic with them. Any logic like this should be done when processing the annotation in my opinion.<p>Java annotations sure are limited and it&#x27;s does seem kind of weird that you can&#x27;t use null as default value. But I never encountered any real problems that couldn&#x27;t be handled by inspecting annotations using reflections or annotation processors.",1412441471

Good ideas should be adopted no matter where they originated.<p>Fortunately not everyone in the Java community is happy with the way things are. Indeed, Java 8 fixes some of the issues mentioned here, like repeating an annotation. Obviously this wasn&#x27;t some brilliant insight developed in a vacuum, people looked at C# and thought &quot;Neat, I want that!&quot;, and now Java is a better language because of it.<p>As engineers we should not settle for the way things are.

8409873,comment,8409781,8409781,2,0,paulhauggis,,,"&quot;Ownership is a pain. I honestly can’t imagine ever wanting to own a house. Because I can’t stand the thought of having to deal with all the crap that comes with owning such a large and expensive thing. Renting is so much more convenient, and the fact is, I’m willing to pay for that convenience.&quot;<p>Yes, it&#x27;s convenient..until your landlord raises your rent > 10% every year and you have to move (multiple times in multiple years).  When I rented, my rent started out at $800/month and I had to leave when they raised it to $1500/month (after 5 years of raises).<p>&quot;Freelancers are kings. Freelancing is becoming a way of life, too. I’ve been hearing from a lot of highly talented engineers, designers and product managers recently who are going freelance by choice. Work is becoming much more fluid, and workers have increasing control over when and where they work. This makes them less tied down.&quot;<p>I freelanced for 3 years and traveled throughout Asia during this time.  Yes, you are less tied down, but when you require a stable (and fast) Internet connection, your travel choices become limited.<p>The majority of companies want a meeting a couple of times/week, some over Skype/Webex.  Try this in a popular Internet cafe in Cambodia.<p>Freelance also isn&#x27;t all that great.  You are treated as a tool for companies and are used, abused, and the first to be let go.  I am much happier running my own company.<p>&quot;The royal we. Families are getting smaller. Many of us may never have kids or get married at all. As family sizes shrink, there’s less incentive to settle down.&quot;<p>I know plenty of people that say this in their 20s and now have 2 kids in their 30s.<p>&quot;Democratization of style. There is a convergence happening in aesthetic style. We all basically like the same things, at approximately the same time. But, what we like changes relatively quickly, according to the latest hipster fashions. Ergo, borrowing is better for us than owning.&quot;<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I tend to sacrifice fashion for convenience.  Borrowing gets tiring and is not nearly as convenient as owning.",1412441438

8409765,comment,8404990,8405232,1,0,calhoun137,,,"There is a pretty strong overlap between material science and quantum field theory.  To name just one example, the idea of the Higg&#x27;s particle actually has it&#x27;s genesis in theoretical solid state physics [1].<p>Most material solids can be described as a lattice, where there is some unit cell of a given size, say L, which is repeated periodically in all directions.<p>There are various types &quot;quasi-particles&quot; that can move through a lattice, examples include phonon&#x27;s and poloron&#x27;s.  The thing that makes the quasi-particle concept useful is that it is greatly simplifies the description of the collective motion of a large number of particles which are all interacting.<p>An electromagnetic field in a region of space can (sort of) be described as a lattice, and this result is one of the deepest and most profound results in theoretical physics, imo.  The basic idea is the EM field can be thought of in the following way: every point in space can be treated mathematically as a simple vibrating spring (harmonic oscillator).<p>In other words, <i>the analogy between fundamental particles and quasi-particles breaks down because</i> in a material solid there is a unit cell of size L, but in the vacuum this lattice size is 0.<p>The idea that every point in space is a harmonic oscillator works in the sense that it makes predictions that agree with experiment; however theoretically it has an extremely severe  flaw which has motivated a large amount of research on the quantum vacuum.  The problem is that the energy of a region of space with zero EM field (i.e. a vacuum) comes out to be infinite.  There are various tricks to avoid this infinity, but the simplest one is to just use some non-zero value for the lattice spacing of the vacuum.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Warren_Anderson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Warren_Anderson</a>",1412438573

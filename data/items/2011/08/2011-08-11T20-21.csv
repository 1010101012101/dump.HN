Your viral load remains very low; I remember a study in Switzerland that suggested that two HIV-discordant monogamous partners engaging in anal sex aren't at significant risk of seroconversion even without a condom, if the HIV-positive partner uses his drugs at prescribed and there aren't compounding factors like STDs. Which isn't to say it's a good idea.<p>It's definitely a trade I'd make in a second, though. Then again, I've seen people waste away from leukemia and not from AIDS, so my perspective is admittedly skewed.<p>Edited to add: that study is most definitely not a license to have unprotected sex with someone who has HIV.

Funds already earmark follow-on round funds for their investments - so that doesn't change.  To the degree that funds DON'T do this entrepreneurs should be VERY wary (essentially VCs are exposing your business to their business risks).... Think about how volatile the stock market can be when it corrects - if a VC is stopping investment based on a market correction that makes them concerned about raising the next iteration of their fund - then what they are essentially saying is that right up to the crash they were more than willing (to use a aviation term) invest past V1 (the point where there is no abort of takeoff)... which is just reckless.<p>B.) This would only affect a portion of the VC universe at a time given the length of an specific fund's lifecycle, overlaps between funds within a specific firm, etc.  And certain funds (e.g,. top decile performers) shouldn't be impacted at all.<p>3.

2874663,comment,2873325,2873325,7,0,tomp,,,"The handling of the <i>this</i> argument is of crucial importance in the design of programming languages with first-class functions that feature some kind of objects, i.e. data with attached behavior (call them functions or methods).<p>There are basically 3 possibilities that I see:<p>- <i>differen invocation syntax</i>, with <i>explicit this parameter</i>
Lua is an example of a language that uses this approach:<p><pre><code>  table.method1(arg1, arg2, arg3)
  table:method2(arg2, arg3, arg4)
</code></pre>
Here, method1 is called with 3 parameters (without the <i>this</i> parameter), but method2 is called with 4 (the first parameter is the <i>this</i> object, table).<p>This is undoubtedly the approach with the most efficient execution, but it places a huge burden on the programmer, as one has to distinguish methods from ordinary functions both at call site, and at definition (if you attach a normal function to a table and invoke it as a method, you have a problem if the function doesn't expect the first parameter to be <i>this</i>). Also, this approach is the opposite from the one found in the traditional OOP languages such as Java and C++.<p>- <i>automatic method binding</i>
Python is an example of a language that uses this approach:<p><pre><code>  f = obj.method
  f(arg1, arg2)
</code></pre>
In this case, the function f is called with the first parameter being <i>self</i>, the Pythonic <i>this</i>. In Python, the <i>self</i> parameter (Pythonic <i>this</i>) is declared explicitly at method definition, but I believe that it could also work if it were implicit.<p>This approach is perhaps the most sensible approach from the programmer's point of view, where methods ""just work"" - you can call them using the normal dot syntax, and you don't need to worry when using methods as first-class functions - they will remember the object they were attached to.<p>However, a naive implementation of this technique is quite slow, as the function must be bound to the <i>this</i> object every time it is accessed. It is possible to invoke (access and call at the same time) a method without this overhead (e.g. use some object's internal dictionary to check whether it has a method with the appropriate name, and call it, passing <i>this</i> as the first parameter), but not when accessing attributes - one must check whether the attribute is a method, and bind it to <i>this</i> if it is. However, this is an irrelevant argument in a language that supports arbitrary getters/setters (which seems to be the direction that new OO languages are headed in).<p>Also, it complicates matters with ad-hoc objects:<p><pre><code>  o = {}
  f = (arg1, arg2, arg3) -> arg1 + arg2 + arg3
  o.m = f
</code></pre>
When we invoke the method <i>m</i> of the object <i>o</i>, do we pass <i>this</i> as the first parameter (where the function <i>f</i> might no expect it) or not (loosing the OO aspect)? Python conveniently avoids this matter by not supporting ad-hoc objects out-of-the-box.<p>- <i>implicit this</i>
Javascript is an example of a language that uses this approach:<p><pre><code>  f = (arg1, arg2) -> print this, arg1 + arg2
  f(1, 2)        // prints ""undefined, 3""
  o.m = f
  o.m(1, 2)      // prints ""o, 3""
</code></pre>
Here, <i>this</i> is an implicit, undeclared parameter of every function, and is passed at every call/invocation (if a function is called like in the second line, <i>this</i> is set to the global object <i>window</i> in the browser, or to <i>undefined</i> in strict mode). Here, there is some overhead at every unbound function call, as an extra parameter is passed, and it is not clear how this overhead can be avoided (except by avoiding plain function calls, and sticking to OOP). Ad-hoc object creation is simple, as functions/methods have a simple way of knowing whether they were called (without a <i>this</i> parameter) or invoked (with a <i>this</i> parameter). However, care must be taken when using methods as first class values:<p><pre><code>  f = o.m             // f will have the this parameter undefined
  g = o.m.bind(o)     // g will have o passed as the this parameter
</code></pre>
A syntax extension would be nice, e.g.<p><pre><code>  g = bind o.m
</code></pre>
but it might be ambiguous. In my experience, this situation is not encountered very frequently, so the trade-off is acceptable.<p>---------------<p>I see all these possibilities lacking, but tend to consider the third solution as the most favorable, mainly because it supports elegant and unambiguous ad-hoc object construction. Maybe we could combine solutions 2 and 3, e.g. by using getters on method objects that set <i>this</i> automagically, but to keep ad-hoc objects simple, an implicit <i>this</i> seems to be a must, which means we cannot avoid the overhead...<p>I'm sure I'm missing a very simple, straightforward alternative, and I would be extremely grateful for any comments or constructive criticism.",1313095102

These tables, combined with dictionaries, could spot words that could look like dictionary entries visually but are not spelled in the ordinary way. This approach could even spot things that have been problems for years in pure ASCII: confusion of 0 and O, of l and 1 and I, of rn and m, etc, It could also spot insertions of non-visible characters into such things as URLs and filenames.<p>Such a system would be able to spot .exe files that had names written in such a way that the .exe extension was not visually displayed at the end of the name. If you double-clicked such a file the first time, it could ask you if you realized that it is program you are about to run and not a "".jpg"" as the name might suggest. In fact, it could ask you about any file whose real extension and apparent visual extension differed.<p>There will still be problems that will sneak through, just as today you can phish people with subtle misspellings that don't require anything more than ASCII.<p>But making this a part of the system's evolving general malware detection system, with human-created tables and heuristics borrowed from malware detectors, spam filters, and spell checkers, is the best solution, IMO.",1313095065

You call it the obvious solution, but really there is only one solution worth spending your time on. The correct solution is to simulate the game on the server and update each client with only the information it is allowed to know.<p>The client should not make any decisions and should only ask for permission. If the player wants to move forward then the client sends a request to the server to move forward. The server will respond with new player position data if the move was allowed. If the player asks to move through a wall then the server will not comply.<p>The server should also never send clients data about other players not in their field of view (or in the immediate area, all depends on the game). To send the client any information it shouldn't have or to allow the client to make any decisions that the server takes and runs with is absolutely poor programming in the multiplayer game space.<p>You just have to ask yourself if it's worth it to possibly save some time at the expense of introducing a systemic flaw in your client and server that allows cheating to occur. For a competitive multiplayer game I think it's worth the time to make sure you're not sending clients the position data of invisible players.<p>Edit:<p>The client will most likely also calculate some of these changes at the same time it requests a move though. This is called client-side prediction and it's done to keep the gameplay smooth over unreliable and slow networks. The clients will interpolate and extrapolate certain game moves and sync with what the server says as the data becomes available. That's why sometimes in Counter-Strike (for example) you can run in one direction for a second or two and then suddenly be in another location altogether, because the server corrected the client's increasingly inaccurate extrapolation of position.<p>Some reading if this sort of stuff interests you:<p><a href=""http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_N...</a><p><a href=""http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating...</a><p><a href=""http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/q3suggest/final/generic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/q3suggest/final/generic.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.pingz.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/tribes_networking_model.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pingz.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/tr...</a> [pdf]<p><a href=""http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/networked-physics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/networked-physics/</a><p><a href=""http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=415538"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=415538</a>",1313094629

But I still contend it's bad architecture--just as many seemingly convenient programming practices are.<p>The loop functions operate on (global) variables that are not explicitly passed into them. Therefore, without consulting their source, one cannot know what data they're touching. It's not obvious how and when these global variables get set and modified (which is one of the classic reasons global variables are considered Evil). Presumably, the variable are are set by the_loop(), but the opacity here is bad style.<p>On top of that, the fact that you must have these globals set to use the Loop's formatting functions makes it much less practical to use them in novel ways--i.e. in contexts other than the Loop. Sure, if you want that same data somewhere other than the Loop, there are other functions you can use. This is the typical reply I've heard in defense of the Loop. But that's a fairly poor defense: It's admitting that the API is so wonky, the WP devs had to create a bevy of functions that all do roughly the same thing to patch over each other's weaknesses. Why should there be a different way to get some post data in the main content area versus anywhere else?<p>BTW, I'm not just nit-picking Wordpress about the Loop. I'm talking about it because it's a well-known and very illustrative example of what I perceive to be a broader pattern of poor architecture throughout Wordpress.",1313093764

Trying to force everyone into the same template seems to me a Very Bad Idea.<p>I think we do much better with our current model, where each jurisdiction has its own legal and ethical norms, jurisdictions may reach multilateral agreements on areas of common interest, and anyone wanting to operate across jurisdictions needs to do so in a way that is compatible with everywhere they operate and any common agreements between those places. In this case, economic incentives for major multinationals to be able to operate across borders is, or at least should be, a compelling reason for national governments to accept their limitations and not try to exert influence beyond their borders in unsustainable ways.",1313093087

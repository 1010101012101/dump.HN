IIRC, Palm's founders too.<p>My first Palm even matched Newton's colors...<p>Seriously: Palm right now has its fortune hanging on a smartphone that cannot be used anyplace other than the US.<p>As much as I wish them well (I really do) I am not confident Joel could lead the whole PC industry anywhere. He has his hands full.<p>I would consider hiring back Wozniak. The guy has some serious street cred.",1245498695
666355,comment,666112,666134,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"It's insane not because it's cynical, but because we've now seen twice that when Steve Jobs is gone, Apple falls back on TimCookPhilSchillerEddyCueJonathanIve and every other one of its other brilliant, beauty-minded industrialists. Jobs once said that he views Apple as his lasting triumph, not the Mac or the iPod, because with Apple he took his ideals and embedded them within the company upon his return. The result is that any one of the people at Apple is as brilliant as Jobs is. Some would argue that Tim Cook is a better Jobs than Jobs himself.",1245498523

666353,comment,666112,666273,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"I've developed my own code of ethics, which says... that Steve Jobs is a better man than most of us will ever be. He pursued the things he was curious in, made sophisticated pieces of technology readily available for consumers, was enough of an asshole not to have to conform much of his work to standards he couldn't bear to conform to, developed enough business acumen to deal with lots of people he probably didn't want to deal with, funded the most brilliant animator of this generation out of his own pocket, created not one but <i>two</i> companies with a greater reputation for excellence than any company that's existed before, and he did it all with a flair for the dramatic. In the meantime he got married and had kids and survived cancer and talked a lot to kids about loving life and survival.<p>When I use a computer or listen to an iPod, when I prepare to upload my music to iTunes practically hassle-free, when I look at the Mac-using companies that have developed beautiful products, I'm aware that Steve Jobs stands as a symbol for all of the things I love about this community. A lot of us have that feeling. It's not celebrity worship like gets slurred around a lot. It's more that Jobs was the first pro-aesthetic guy in computers, and he's remained an inspiration and a hero to those of us that like beautiful product, and revolutionary product, and annual dramatic revelations on-stage.",1245498343

The simplest approach would be to timeout the connection if a credible set of headers is not received within a certain time.<p>This attack is based on the idea the attacker commands more resources than the target server.

Apple's stock isn't interesting Hacker News.<p>This is here because it's really fun talking about Steve Jobs, love him or hate him, and because the man's the archetypal startup founder along with Woz. That's totally fine but let's not kid ourselves.",1245497814

666346,comment,666112,666242,0,0,demallien,,,"Out of curiousity, what are your examples of Jobs inviting people into his private life?  From where I stand, he's always been very demanding about the need to keep his private life private.<p>Apple does not rely on Jobs' public profile for success.  Yes, they do rely on his ability as a driver of innovation, but if Jobs were never to say a word in public again, it wouldn't seem to hurt Apple (at least, that's my opinion, having watched the last keynote without him).  As such, I don't think Jobs has traded on publicity for his success, and can consequently reasonably request that we leave his private life alone.<p>Meh.",1245496696

666342,comment,665835,665835,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"I think the argument is totally flawed. Brains and eyeballs are biological. Perhaps biology is more bottoms up than top down or more like generate and test, yet it produces systems of incredible complexity that are remarkably robust. For example a human heart beats ~ 1 billion times, I've yet to see a human designed and architected pump do that. We just don't understand very well yet how the liver and pancreas work and western medicine is particularly weak in taking a holistic or systems view to the body.<p>Software, bad or good, is not like biology and it's not like construction. Software is mathematics.",1245496113

The main anomaly is not in the header structure, it's in the number of sessions opened simultaneously by one host. This particular tool uses broken headers for some reasons; other ones don't. But they all open sessions excessively.<p>So you just use iptables connlimit match block the clients with more than e.g. 10 connections.",1245495717

5406336,comment,5403988,5405937,5,0,eric_bullington,,,"This is what we did about 10 years ago (GenX), for a similar reason (wife wanted something unique).  It was really fun going around antique shops looking for a ring -- and we're not really the ""antiquing"" types.  Something to look into if you're looking for something different, particularly if you're in a city with a large neighborhood of antique shops.<p>EDIT: And to avoid misrepresenting my wife, I should add it was not a diamond ring (it's a pearl).  My wife worked in African before we got married and would have nothing to do with diamonds.",1363773529

5406334,comment,5405630,5406168,3,0,CodeMage,,,"Funny, what you call out here is quite similar to what I've witnessed, too, only I have a different point of view.<p>For example, ""we know agile better than the project managers"" often comes from people who find themselves in yet another cargo-cult agile environment with a Scrum master who not only doesn't have a clue about Scrum, but is also pretty much convinced that it's a wrong idea and therefore doesn't give a shit about what he's doing and whether the latest process-related brainwave coming from above is one step forward or -- more likely -- two step backwards. In such circumstances, you really do know more about agile than managers when you 1) say that it defeats the purpose of Scrum to have people filling out how many hours they've spent working on an item alongside how many they have left, 2) point out the inefficiency and banality of hour-long discussions on whether we move the user story from one sprint into the next one or create a copy of it, 3) complain about having 1-2 hours of sprint planning, a 1-hour mid-sprint review meeting and 1-2 hours of sprint review on top of 30-minute daily meetings in a 2-week sprint and 4) wonder why nobody seems to have read the bloody agile manifesto itself.<p>So when you hear ""if only we were truly agile"" coming from a dev, maybe it's not an incompetent egomaniac on a power trip looking to shift the blame for the things that don't work. Maybe it's someone like me who is sick to the core of managers who can't hear you because their head is up their ass -- yet somehow there's always enough place in their for yet another ""Agile"" consultant's shaft to get cozy with.<p>Yes, I'm bitter. That doesn't make me wrong.",1363773415

I have... issues... with Scrum (not the process itself - which is a damn fine process improvement and project management framework - but the industry that has sprung up around it).<p>However - your comparison is pretty much a straw man. I'm not looking for good Scrum / Agile experience <i>instead</i> of code experience. I'm looking for code experience <i>and</i> good agile team experience. Because - over the last ten years -  the teams I've seen using agile approaches have been darn effective.<p>When I'm helping build a technical team you need great coders and you need great team players working in a way that makes everybody happy and effective. Ideally you want to recruit folk who are already great coders and are already used to working in effective team environments.<p>If you think <i>either</i> of those is a natural skill or simple then you're mistaken or very lucky. I can mentor folk up on both sides - sometimes it's actually easier to turn a good coder into a great one than it is to turn an asocial fuckwit prima-donna coder into an efffective team player ;-)",1363773382

To learn this, I suggest you do two things that might surprise you.<p>DO THIS \nFirst, write a 2 minute infomercial script for your product. Practice being the presenter. This is a surprisingly informative exercise. Make sure to address any questions or objections people would have about the product, support or refunds in your script.<p>THEN DO THIS \nSecond, write out a one page direct response magazine advertisement for your product. Anticipate any and all questions, objections and concerns in your ad. For examples, see old-school direct response ads by Joe Sugarman for products such as the Pocket CV from the 70's.<p>IT""S THE PROCESS\nBy going through the process of writing a 2 minute infomercial script, and also writing a 1 page direct response magazine advertisement you will be forced to understand and echo features, benefits and emotional benefits and also anticipate and answer questions and objections. These are the two most valuable selling skills whether in person, online or in print.<p>SELLING IN PRINT \nBeing able to sell in print is really valuable, because your ads and advertising can scale to billions of pages.<p>There's a lot to know about selling, marketing and developing products that sell. I've been studying it for 10 years, and it's going to take a lifetime of learning to do my best work.<p>I would be glad to share some things I have learned with you.

In some domains that added risk is unacceptable, but for many applications it's a very worthwhile tradeoff.<p>I think often when people say ""I hate rails"", they are really saying, ""I hate building the types of apps that rails excels at"". Which is fine, and makes sense, because rails excels at making apps that can be very cool and innovative on the product side, but are usually pretty boring on the engineering side--it doesn't really get interesting for the engineers until it's time to start replacing the lower level tiers of rails with something else.

Why is one burger better than another, or one steak? I can't say we have the science yet for exact measurement, but it may come. Sometimes it's obvious: cheap industrial plastic supermarket cheddar really is full of less decent chemicals for your senses than pricier artisan ones like Humboldt Fog. That can be demonstrated, and I suspect in the future more will be demonstrable with wine. So far you can realise why that cheap Zin blend from Lodi doesn't really do it for you with the most obvious of measurements: yield! They get even 10 tons per acre there rather than 1-3 tons in a high-quality vineyard. Fewer nutrients and flavours to go around, and more water, sugar and untasty components have to flesh it out (poor overburdened vines, eh!) that's just the first variable: I know some more, but there are good soil scientists who can tell you a lot about all of the other variables too.

His words: \n'Well, one man's ""bullshit"" is another man's ""eye of the beholder"" sort of thing.<p>It is true that of the three aspects that originally made diamonds ""above the rest"" and therefore desirable, i.e., their rarity, unparalleled hardness, and beauty, the first two don't really apply anymore and the third is increasingly iffy as technology marches on -- but the same could be said of other objects to which we ascribe great value, i.e., ""fine"" art, which began as sublime and evocative interpretation of life, divinity and transcendence, but which these days more often than not is just a hodgepodge of ""Emperor has no clothes"" random splotches, un-made beds and (literally) piles of shit, but to which we nevertheless still ascribe great value. So go know.<p>In any case, the ""death"" of diamonds has been predicted before, and by better writers and more thorough reporters than Mr. Dhar, here, c.f.: Edward Jay Epstein ""The Rise And Fall Of Diamonds"", 1982, -- and yet Cecil Rhodes' babies are still going, stronger and more lucrative than ever.<p>There is certainly nothing intrinsically valuable about diamonds -- but then what does have ""intrinsic"" value? Even gold is largely ""valuable"" because of a near-universal belief and agreement that it should have value, and has done so since the dawn of recorded time.  If everyone in the world suddenly decided that gold (or diamonds, come to that), no longer had any value, well, that ""value"" would certainly disappear -- it has happened before, to other ""valuable"" commodities, such as tulips in the early 17th century and other evanescent enthusiasms throughout history. But some consensuses seem to be more permanent and on solid ground than others -- and I suspect that diamonds and other precious stones are more in the ""gold"" class than in the ""tulip"" and ""piles of arty shit"" class....<p>So are diamonds really ""forever""?  Maybe not, but probably so. They've survived the emergence of synthetics without so much as a hiccup, and they've even survived the disappearance of DeBeers as a controlling agent (DeBeers, although still an important factor, no longer has anything like any monopolistic control -- it is just one of 4 or 5 other ""important players"" in the business), and the diamond industry even laughed off (with my, ahem, small contribution) the ""blood diamond"" non-scandal, so I'm pretty confident that they (diamonds) will carry on through such iconoclastic pinpricks and nitpicks as may appear on W's ""Interwebs"".<p>So, ""bullshit"" diamonds well may be, but tell me -- when did being ""bullshit"" ever stop (or even slow down) anybody or anything, especially in these days of ascendancy of the likes of Justin Bieber and Dennis Rodman? Nevah hotchee, GI -- in fact, I'd say that bullshit is one of our great growth industries as we move heedlessly into the 21st Century, so if diamonds really are ""bullshit"", then this article can only constitute yet another boost for the industry.'",1363771912

That makes the player into the author and shifts that exact authorial/player tension into the purpose of the game. Your score is in two parts: 1. the fame of the chosen hero, 2. the happiness of the chosen hero. The end game is that in order to get the highest score in fame, the hero must become aware of your influence in their lives (much of which will have been negative) and gain enough power to destroy you.

That's quite a different thing -- it's not unlike saying, ""I don't want black people marrying white people.""<p>Before you reply saying, ""But that's not a fair comparison -- black and white people are normal, but gay people are abnormal"", consider that (a) it wasn't too long ago that black people were unfairly regarded as abnormal, and (b) there's no good evidence that being gay is abnormal, as that word is most commonly used.<p>Also, why not ask yourself the same question that judges are expected to ask themselves before making a ruling -- which is ""Where's the harm?"" How does the existence of gay marriage hurt you personally? Consider that gay couples are going to live together anyway (because being gay is not a crime) -- all that changes is that the rights and traditions of civil unions extend to those couples.",1363770224

The differences are that you're specifically allowed to work full time on your company. The company has to be vetted to make sure it's not completely ridiculous, but all profits you make are yours. It's a fantastic lifeline and without it Urban Airship would definitely not exist. It's also a federal program (as well as federally funded), though the states run it - in other words, California could implement it. They just haven't.",1363770056

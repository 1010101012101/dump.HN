Lots of idling, powering accessory equipment, high speed short pursuit, long highway cruise.

It's clear that they have made sure that they have all the key data capture points switched on for a journalistic test drive.<p>It doesn't surprise me that a big media columnist on a topic is so in-bed with the industry he covers that he goes out of his way to defend incumbents from newcomers.  I'm just glad that this nonsense has been exposed for what it is.<p>I'll be interested to see how the NYT handles it - though I suspect it'll be with denials and obfuscation as is par for the course for them in what has been a shameful decade or more of bogus stories, fabrications and toeing the establishment line on everything even in the face of countervailing evidence (that's as long as I've been in the US and paying attention).",1360828764

There is a very well defined system that has been created over decades or centuries of networking. You're not going to break into the corporate system on merit alone after all these years of 'by the book'.<p>Startups - especially your own - are the best method for getting 'around the system'. Startups are nearly always very heavily based on what you can accomplish and ship in the first couple months you start there, and you will quickly build a name for yourself if you can succeed.<p>There are also a number of ways to get 'back into the system' regardless of your age, such as the numerous degrees and diplomas offered directly at someone like you.

I was as skeptical of the wisdom of Tesla attacking NYT's journalist for their Model S review as all the other HNers - but this is incredible.<p>First: I realize the fact that what the hardware logs show and what the user was shown may not be one and the same (i.e. hardware sensors may indicate charge at 28% but due to a bug (it's possible!) it may be shown to be full). But their travel logs shred, I repeat, <i>shred</i> Broder's credibility and claims alike.<p>It really does look like he was hell-bent on ripping Tesla a new one in his review. Taking Tesla's rebuttal at face value: purposely embarking on journeys over twice the indicated available range, driving around in circles in an empty parking lot to kill batteries, turning up the heat and claiming to have turned it down (""shaking, shivering, and with white knuckles"" no less).<p>They post images, graphs, logs, maps, and more. I'm incredibly surprised at how well they're defending themselves against dishonest reviews - for example, I'd never have thought to log the changes to the cabin temperature, but apparently they've done so and more!<p>This post makes me want to reconsider a Model S as my next car. As far as I'm concerned, this is exactly the kind of attention to detail I want going into the engineering, design, and manufacture of my vehicle.<p>I'd be interested in hearing NYT's response to this - they previously stated unconditionally that they stand by Broder's review and believe it to be honest, truthful, and factual.<p>If indeed at the end of the day this was Broder pushing his own agenda, not only ignoring but outright faking facts, then I think his journalistic career should be over.",1360828391

5218322,comment,5217541,5218264,5,0,mythrowaway0,,,"Notice how your quote includes the phrase ""large-scale"" behind it? That's because of what I, you know, wrote in my original comment about maneuver warfare not implying a certain scale or strategy in particular. You're proving my point and disagreeing with me at the same time, which is rather remarkable. Lind's equivalence of third-generation warfare to being called ""maneuver warfare"" is a definition that I happen to disagree with, as I think maneuvers in general evolve as war itself does. Terrorism itself is another evolution of a maneuver, in my opinion.<p>Maneuver warfare isn't the specific strategy on a general's table. It's an ethos of war. In particular, maneuver warfare <i>embraces</i> decentralized command, as you're so vociferously citing in your defense; Iraqi Freedom was a war of colonels, not generals, as discussed in a link I shared with you earlier.<p>I tried to be kind in my reply since you share a passion for military theory, and it's a topic I happen to be <i>extremely</i> versed in (as in, my entire adult life to this day). I hope one day you realize that there are people out there in the world that know more about a topic than you do, don't feel like justifying that authority to you, and that you should appreciate that they took some time out of their day to try to inform you rather than attack them belligerently because they dared to disagree with you.<p>I see this is fruitless, so, best of luck debating with other laypersons on the Internet.",1360827951

I've read reports that China provides the North with about half (or more) of its food. I'd imagine a substantial portion of that goes to feed NK's military.<p>The only solution will very likely involve China, and I can't imagine that they'll go willingly. They may change their mind if NK lobs an atomic weapon at the South or at US interests (continental if they can reach; elsewhere if not), but I'm dubious even that might work.<p>Assuming the North's military leadership doesn't completely lose its few remaining marbles, they might believe that nuclear proliferation within (in the form of many functional, working weapons) gains them sufficient bargaining power that they can do whatever they want. In that circumstance, it's plausible that they might wind up stepping on China's toes. Although, I highly doubt this would happen either.<p>It's depressing because there's very little that we can do, and China is unlikely to help for reasons bfe cited. They've literally starved out the population that could potentially overthrow the regime from within, so save convincing some segment of their army to stage a coup, all we can do is wait.<p>It also doesn't hurt to spread stories like this one far and wide.

The way we teach is extraordinary inefficient and outdated.<p>For example, spaced repetition is a learning technique that takes advantage of the spacing effect phenomenon that is present in all humans. You know why your teachers told you to study everyday instead of cramming? Well, cramming doesn't help you retain information in the long run! Computers can be used to track every answers and problem, what our weakness are, and to schedule when to review, allowing us to take spaced repetition to its logical conclusion. The computer can generate problems on demand, give out recorded lectures by the very best teacher, and so on.<p>Spacing effects also implies summer vacation is harmful to knowledge acquisition process unless we continuously practice. When we finish high school and college, decays begin to set in because we stop practicing. The result is that countless generation learned mathematics, history, language art, literature, only to forget upon exiting formal education.<p>That's why khanacademy is so powerful. They really do leverage computers to generate problems, explain stuff, track your every mistakes, and schedule practices problem using spaced repetition. Right now, long run khanacademy users like me knows more and is the most refreshed on mathematics than the vast majority of high school students and working adults. We practice math problems everyday, thus ensuring that we never forget and be prepared to build a new knowledge as soon as Khan Academy adds new exercises or revise old one.<p>That's in contrast to going to a very inefficient traditional institutions and receiving a ""great education"" and then immediately forgetting most of what you're taught.

I don't think that is an indictment of YC in the least.<p>Ultimately the OP's argument boils down to the claim that YC solves the credentials trap by ... transforming starting a startup into a credential, as long as it's done with the YC imprimatur. Hardly a solution at all.<p>(Ironically, there <i>is</i> a solid argument to be made about how your essays have done a huge amount to legitimize the act of founding a startup and embolden erstwhile credential seekers to take that risk, even if it doesn't come with a name brand institution attached to it. The author fails to make that point, though.)",1360826413

You fear VC?<p>I fear my established competitors coming down on price faster.  I fear the new entrants (who are cheaper than I am) developing a better reputation. Most of all, I fear screwing it up myself;  really, that's the only thing that will kill me fast.<p>VC funded companies are not even on the radar.   If you have offices on castro street, or university ave?  as far as I am concerned?  you may as well be on another planet entirely.   It's like companies that sell to big corporations, you know?  Yeah, they can marshal huge resources... but they also have the pricing power to take absolutely tremendous margins.  The people I know how to sell to?  they don't even want to look at.    The markets that I want to dominate?  they are so small, that nobody real cares about them.  (I mean, I would like the wider market, too, but if I really earn the market I want most?  even though it's tiny, it's absolutely huge compared to my needs.)<p>Generally speaking?  VC and sole proprietors go after different markets.   We want different things.  And we are good at different things.<p>>The difficulty in starting lifestyle businesses is that you have to put personal savings on the line, and our generation (as a whole) neither has that nor is likely to get there-- ever. You put a lot more on the line when you start one of those than you do when you take a check from a VC.<p>Maybe?  either way, you are going to be putting years of your life into something that is probably going to fail.   I guess with VC, you have a better chance of getting paid something, and you have a better chance of not having the debt follow you after the thing does fail, but eh, the real cost in both situations is the years of your life you spend.<p>Really, maybe there is something to the VC  ""fail fast"" attitude, rather than what I describe as ""the slog""  -  long years of living on sustenance wages, pouring the difference into your company.<p>If I had the last 10 years of my own life back?  My slog, the time I spent pouring all my excess effort into this sort of thing?   I don't know if I would do it.   I might just stick with a dayjob, and get a hobby or something.<p>Or, maybe I'd do a VC-style ""fail fast""  -  try an idea for a few months, then write it off as a failure if it doesn't come up during that time.<p>I mean, I don't have those 10 years to do over;  I have the result.  A bunch of servers, a bunch of contracts, a bunch of customers.   A living wage, (but still like 1/3rd what google would pay me) and a bunch of contacts.<p>I am in a state where the only option is forward;  I can't quit now or I lose 10 years of work (and a company with north of a quarter million in revenue isn't nothing... I mean, if I sold it?  yeah, it's nothing.  but it's a point from which I can try other things.)<p>So yeah.  I am moving forward, (and I have made dramatic changes;   other people (not VC, technical people that I know and trust)  now own parts of my company.  This is /huge/  - a big part of why I went into business for myself was to be my own boss, and I'm still the majority shareholder?  but for the first time in a long time, I answer to other people.   It is.... very different.)   But, you know what?  after those ten years?  I am not so sure I agree with your statement that starting a business with your own resources is better than taking some idiot's money.  It's certainly not easier, and worst of all, there is nothing to say ""You have failed, go home, get some sleep, and go get a real job.""  which is the real danger.  With a reasonable lifestyle business, assuming you can create value with your labour, well, you can keep going at this half-success level, really, forever.  There really is such thing as being too persistent.",1360826380

Radios were still too large and power-hungry to be practical anywhere but at sea, last-mile telephone cables tended to get cut by artillery as soon as battle started, and optical signalling (e.g. flags) were difficult to make out near the front, leaving commanders basically with runners and carrier pigeons as soon as battle started.<p>When a local engagement can be won and lost in half an hour to an hour, but the communications RTT is 2-3 hours, maneuver warfare gets impractical (as do a lot of other things, like long range artillery against anything other than fortifications).",1360826233

Some teams that applied, were composed of some of THE BEST hackers (REAL hackers, not marketers) programmers, and the best designers, with loads of experience running start-ups. But they never got in. Neither did I.<p>Atleast, I applied as a sole founder, so it's reasonable that I didn't get in. But I was surprised (shocked) to see that even the top hackers/designers never got in. I wondered why. And then I discovered, it was all about credentials. None of us were product managers from Facebook/Google/etc.<p>Here's the thing - This article is irony at best. I want you to understand that no matter what you do, what skills you have, YC looks into<p>1) Where you come from.<p>2) What credentials you have.<p>YC solves the credentials trap by looking at your credentials on behalf of the rest. YC is not interested if you have a good idea. YC is interested if you are a good executer of ideas. And it's a very fair metric. But, the way they do it is scary at best - Much of the people they select are only top dogs - (ex) product managers from Google, Facebook or someone from a well-known company. NO, they don't select everyone this way, but for the majority of the people they select, this is how it works. And as for the rest that they select, the ones without credentials, its a small percentage, which means you have to really compete hard to get in, if you're not from a well-respected company like Google or Facebook or Twitter.<p>Worse is the fact that the applications are filtered by the alumnii, hence you never know what metric they use to select people. But eventually post selection, you notice that these people who were selected are from some hot company like Google, Facebook etc.<p>Paul Graham is a great man, and I have great (enormous) respect for him. It's because of him that this start-up industry is receiving proper attention. But, if someone is going to tell me YC solves the credentials problem, etc. then I'm not stupid enough to buy it. It's simply not true.<p>If you've watched Ratatouille, you may recall the quote:<p>""Anyone can cook"";<p>Which means (What it means is what the movie's about):<p>""Not everyone can become an artist, but, a great artist can come from anywhere..""",1360825974

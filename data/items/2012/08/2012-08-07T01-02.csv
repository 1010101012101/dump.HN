This is quite similar to the process of radiation poisoning, where chemical bonds are destroyed by the decay products. So for a rather handwaving estimate, we can assume that the processes are the same.<p>The lethal dose of radiation is about 3-5 Sv, that is 3 to 5 J/ kg absorbed radiation (times some factors, which describe how the radiation is absorbed and which type of radiation). Therefore assuming full body irradiation and gamma particles, the lethal dose for an adult would be received in a matter of minutes ( 60kg irradiated by 1 W would be 1 Sv/minute). Note however, that a more realistic scenario for a dirty bomb from a RTG involves ingestion of alpha emitting particles for a rather large number of bystanders. ( And therefore the effects vary a lot by the details of the bomb and the radio isotopes used. )<p>So already with the radioactive material from a rather small RTG you can build a quite potent dirty bomb, rather independent of the exact type of  the RTG used.",1344303677

Imagine the relay computer videos that come across here on occasion, but put in ten large cabinets of the relays and you get an idea of the sound.<p>Of course, touch the relay without a relay pick and you'll get a 120v shock :)<p>The stuff put together in the 80's is a combo of relay logic and old school processors, where you get to load the program in using paper tape!",1344301787

And you're right, it is really hard, but we need to at least convince people to try. While not solved purely at a tooling level, I think tooling can go a long way here by creating interesting and obvious ways to document things in a more meaningful manner than simple API docs. If the cannonical tools for the language are all encouraging you to write long form docs, I have a hard time believing that everyone will simply ignore that.<p>In the end, however, it comes down to us; the people using the language and writing the libraries now to do exactly this. It's why I spent so long writing stuff for Noir and it's something we as a community that already exists need to do better.",1344301323

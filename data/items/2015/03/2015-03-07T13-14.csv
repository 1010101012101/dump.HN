The trick is knowing what will happen to disrupt the trend, and when it happens.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say that there will be a recession in the future of the US and be correct. It&#x27;s almost as easy to be correct if we say we&#x27;ll see one before 2025. But when, exactly? How big? If it was actually easy to predict those things in detail, they&#x27;d be priced into market prices already.<p>Just look at property all over the country. In some cases, the bubble deflated, and prices are still pretty low. In others, there was no real popping of a bubble: A minor dip due to global economic conditions, but prices are higher than they were 7 years ago. The difficulty comes from predicting which ones will recover and which ones will not.<p>If anyone could do this, we&#x27;d see them get insanely rich in the financial markets, but when we compare mutual fund behavior over time, the number of people that beat the market in any period is no different than random chance.

It gives you very few features to play with, forcing you to think hard about how you can solve real problems with these features in the most economic way. The result is much less fun, and the code you write is dull. But it is still useful, often as useful as what you write with a more fun language. And the probability that you will change your code because &quot;feature X is the new hype&quot; is considerably lower.<p>Go is not perfect in any sense of the word; every now and then its feature set turns out to be genuinely limited, and you have to apply hacks. But sometimes when you are forced to think hard, it turns out that you can combine two or more dull features in a creative way to do something you thought were only possible with new, interesting features. This offers a perspective of looking at language features: what are really necessary, and what are there just because programmers want to have fun?<p>Parsimony is a virtue appreciated everywhere in science and technology, except programming, where languages are rated by the number of features they include, and complexities get added to systems until they explode.

I <i>knew</i> about it, but hadn&#x27;t realized its full implications. It&#x27;s the problem of Time Zones.<p>&quot;There are some advantages in belonging to a corridor culture. We&#x27;re not slaves of the sun, and can set all our clocks to the same time, all over Titan. But on Earth!<p>&quot;There are four time zones -- America, Africa, Asia, Oceania -- six hours apart. So when you want to speak to anyone, or make an appointment, you have to know what zone he&#x27;s in. And when you move from one zone to another, you have to put your watch ahead -- or back -- six hours.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s very awkward and confusing, but it was even worse a couple of centuries ago; then there were <i>twenty-four</i> zones, one for every hour of the day! The development of global telecommunications made that situation impossible -- not that it&#x27;s very satisfactory even now. There&#x27;s talk of going over to a single World Time -- probably Absolute Ephemeris Time -- and ignoring the day-night cycle, just as we do. But the arguments on both sides are nicely balance, and no one expects a decision in a hurry. After all, it took several hundred years to get the World Calendar adopted, and <i>that</i> was because the Martian and Lunar administrations simply wouldn&#x27;t put up with Earth&#x27;s ridiculous months any longer ...&quot;<p>I hadn&#x27;t remember the &quot;slaves of the sun&quot; part.

Your employer has until the end of the first year of your employment (technically 11 months and 3 weeks) during which time they can still terminate your employment without fear of the employee making a claim for unfair dismissal. This is because employment legislation provides that you need to be employed for this period of time before you are eligible to lodge a claim.&quot;<p>An employee does gain some protection after passing probation - a longer notice period, usually - but it&#x27;s worth knowing that passing probation isn&#x27;t the be-all and end-all.",1425734503

If the plan fails, then the people get laid off, but it is the management that failed by hiring people they didn&#x27;t actually need. Or it is unpredictable market conditions. A lot of people did everything right but still lost their jobs when the NASDAQ crashed, for example. People who did everything right are losing their jobs right now because of the oil price crash.

Kabel Deutschland is a problem. Their 100mbit is a joke and not better than 16mbit from a proper provider. I wonder if its just the cable technology or them throttling traffic randomly. They alsp give me horrendous international routing. Websites not located within europe go through 300 hops are slow and unenjoyable. I had better experiences in the same city with other ISPs.<p>This is really bad for rural communities. Not only for having not internet but alos for their Economy.

You mentioned 100% retention - so I assume no candidate ever left for another position with a higher salary?<p>Being a specialised consulting firm, I imagine Matasano could offer highly diverse, very interesting work long-term (because consulting), and higher-than-average salaries (because specialised), so maybe it wasn&#x27;t a problem for you to offer higher salaries than the competition, or to retain candidates at equivalent salaries.",1425733464

That comes out to 1500-2000€/m in your pocket and insurance taken care of, which is really not so bad (a lot of people working full time make less than that). Can be more if you made north of 50K a year. Unless you have a crazy mortgage, you can make things work for a while. Also, if you hadn&#x27;t had a pretty solid job for years, you wouldn&#x27;t have gotten a mortgage anyway.<p>After 24 months max and still no job you would fall back to ALGII though. That&#x27;s is taxpayers&#x27; money and essentially rent for a cheap place, health insurance and 400 € in your pocket, which sucks. Plus you have to liquidate any assets you may have left (including life insurance) first and they will make you take a shitty job.",1425733459

On reading about the incident, I thought &quot;What a humorless, vindictive [Beelzebub]&quot; I was kinda glad that she got fired.<p>But then I read on, and I found myself having a lot of empathy for her, and for Hank (although what happened to him, as bad as it was was way less intense and scary than what happened to her). I thought they both made (forgivable) mistakes. Their respective employers meted out not very compassionate punishments, those companies come off badly in the article. The public statements by one of the CEO&#x27;s sounds particularly lame and insincere. More human error. The cascade of errors continues into an avalanche. &quot;The Mob&quot;(i.e. the public) <i>really</i> comes off bad in this story.<p>I don&#x27;t think human error leading to more human errors and bad outcomes itself is groundbreaking news. It&#x27;s more the runaway (not so) positive feedback loop that amplifies errors of (bad) judgement and gut level emotions. We evolved in a context where we only had to contend with unintentionally pissing off maybe a few dozens or hundreds of people with our mistakes. Now millions of people can be infuriated/whipped up into a cyber lynch mob overnight, and even then it&#x27;s still only a tiny fraction of humanity&#x27;s collective attention.<p>Maybe sites like Twitter and Facebook should think about whether or not they have a responsibility to the victims of Mob crucifixion. Even (especially?) the unsympathetic ones, who arguably may have made their own bed and set fire to it. Some kind of circuit breaker when burning crosses start popping up. Cyber public defenders. &quot;Chill out&quot; buttons.<p>The story made me really feel for Adria. It didn&#x27;t hide the fact that she saw things in a very harsh, b&w way. Her letter to her father may have been a blatant attempt to emotionally manipulate the writer and the audience. But it works, even if so. What kind of hurt would make it necessary to resort to that? I feel her humanity. She deserves a shot of redemption.<p>Great article. The other stories are terrific as well, but maybe this one is more of a Puzzlebox.",1425733276

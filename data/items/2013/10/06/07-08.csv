Whether it is the simple initial vote of confidence by links, to google&#x27;s ever changing internal data about clickthrough rates, personalized results, search volumes and general user behavior, or simply from the many hardcoded questions in certain format (&quot;What is the capital of Spain?&quot; or &quot;distance from the sun to jupiter&quot;), Google is continuously getting better at judging intent and answering questions. Similarly for a lot of the other technologies, such as translations, the real work is being done by consumers and users who generate the gigantic corpus of data.<p>The question is -- does IBM have access to the same amount of data?",1381046393

By standard economics, this means that the price of illegal immigrant labor would increase, so even the illegal immigrants would benefit. Sounds like a win/win to me.",1381046108

6503477,comment,6502417,6502417,3,0,orionblastar,,,"I saw the movie today, had to chaperon my son and his girlfriend to the movie.<p>I noticed some flaws, but for a Hollywood movie they were using &quot;comic book physics&quot; which most scifi movies and TV shows use.<p>I assume that it takes place in an alternative universe where NASA didn&#x27;t scrub the Space Shuttle program, and space stations are placed close to each other as some form of disaster planning, and of course commercial companies like Space-X and Virgin Galactic didn&#x27;t exist.<p>I kind of thought it was like &quot;The Net&quot; but instead of running from the police and computer hackers, she was trying to escape from space and get back to Earth. :)<p>Anyway my son and his girlfriend saw it and loved it, and both decided to take astronomy because of it. They are both freshmen in high school taking physical science. I think the movie was meant for them. I had to explain after the movie how in space there is no air, and the space capsule  parachute was tangled on the ISS and she had to cut it free. That it wasn&#x27;t because it would slow down the capsule but that it had tethered it to the ISS. That if the chute was free there&#x27;d be no air to slow it down. They thought there was something in space the chute would slow it down on, but I told them it was a vacuum. Chutes only work in the atmosphere. That the friction of reentering the atmosphere is what had caused the heat that was burning up the other capsule she had to get on the Chinese station.<p>Some spoilers <i>Warning</i><p>Let me see, Explorer Space Shuttle trying to repair a telescope with a new circuit board. Russians go crazy trying to blow up out of control spy satellite with some super missile that just wipes out all satellites and throws debris everywhere. NASA was not aware of it, and had miscalculated the velocity of the debris so there was no way to abort the mission before they got hit. Some super space suit thruster pack got George Cloney to fly around like Superman and save Sandra Bullock and get to the ISS. But the ISS has problems and the Russian space capsule has a deployed parachute in space. Bullock gets snagged on parachute cord, Cloney has to let go to save her or else she&#x27;ll get lose. She has to use Russian capsule to get to the Chinese station that has a clone of the Russian capsule with a working parachute to get back to Earth. I won&#x27;t say how it ends though.<p>Sure it was mostly animation for 90 minutes, and we saw it in IMAX. But the main point is that it gets teenagers to study more math and science as a result of seeing the movie and asking questions about the physics involved. So I can forgive the mistakes and &quot;comic book physics&quot;, if it promotes education.",1381045993

Kolmogorov complexity measures the complexity of a string as the length of the shortest possible program that generates that string.<p>So to measure the complexity of a program P we have to write another program G that generates P and then take G&#x27;s length.

Adding a basic income all at once would have extreme short-term effects on an economy, and that might continue for ten, twenty-odd years.

Long-term we have a <i>chance</i> to reduce the work level back to that of hunting and gathering, while preserving other benefits such as population stability in the face of natural disaster.

6503438,comment,6501769,6502308,1,0,a_e_k,,,"Hi there, speaking of autovectorization, I actually tried it on this last night.  After seeing kid0man&#x27;s post, I decided to try optimizing it and selected that same loop as my target.  (When I wrote the original C++ program, I was favoring conciseness and portability over performance, naturally.)<p>I made many of the same transformations as you did: switching the object&#x27;s data to a structure of arrays, splitting out the computation of the normal from the loop, etc. (even an int hit = -1.)  My goal was to coax Intel&#x27;s compiler into autovectorizing that loop, without directly using vector intrinsics.  I succeeded, but the result turned out to be noticeably slower than just compiling kid0man&#x27;s with -fast.  Part of that, I suspect is that it generated suboptimal code for the reduction over the minimum, where a human programmer would have used a movemask as you did.<p>That said, I&#x27;m fairly curious to experiment with seeing how it would perform with the kernel compiled via ispc [1].<p>Regarding direct use of SIMD intrinsics in inner loops, I have to agree with you that it&#x27;s still reasonably common for this type of thing.  I&#x27;ve certainly done it before in ray tracing contexts [2], and I&#x27;ve seen many others do it as well, e.g. [3] and [4].  Autovectorization and things like Intel&#x27;s array notation extension [5] seem to be getting better all the time, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s generally as performant yet as direct use of intrinsics.  In the cases where it is, it usually seems to have taken a fair amount of coaxing and prodding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ispc.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ispc.github.io/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.utah.edu/~aek/research/triangle.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utah.edu/~aek/research/triangle.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/embree/embree"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/embree/embree</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://visual-computing.intel-research.net/publications/papers/2007/RT2007/vertex_culling.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visual-computing.intel-research.net/publications/pape...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2010/09/03/simd-parallelism-using-array-notation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2010/09/03/simd-parall...</a>",1381044640

Misdiagnosis, when it occurs, is able to be handled on a case-by-case basis; the &quot;no such thing&quot; stigmatization and other similar lines of reasoning, on the other hand, are a priori positions that reinforce biases that actively work against those who are seeking treatment and those who should but aren&#x27;t, and as a result, directly contributes to underdiagnosis.<p>No one looks at increases in cancer rates and decries them as an rising tide of overdiagnoses. Only when talking about mental health can people get away with this sort of shoddy reasoning. A few points:<p>First, the argument itself is faulty. By their very nature, diagnosis rates aren&#x27;t able to support conclusions in <i>either</i> direction on the matter. An increase in diagnoses is not the same as an increase in misdiagnoses. There are multiple significant factors that can contribute to an increase in diagnoses over time (i.e. heightened awareness, decreased in stigma that would otherwise have prevented the patient from seeking treatment, better diagnostic tools, properly recognizing edge cases where ADHD was previously misdiagnosed, etc.). We&#x27;ve seen similar things with other illnesses as well.<p>Simply put, the question that you&#x27;re trying to raise (but aren&#x27;t) is more nuanced: what percentage of those diagnosed do not meet the diagnostic criteria? The two questions are quite distinct.<p>Second, we&#x27;re not exactly working from a comparable baseline when we look towards previous years. Consider factors such as a broader recognition of ADHD symptoms, openness to not simply writing those same symptoms off as &quot;that&#x27;s the way the world works&quot; or &quot;kids will will be kids&quot;, and relative decreases in stigmatization of ADHD itself (e.g. &quot;ok, this is different from those really <i>bad</i> disorders like... schizophrenia [gasp]&quot;). Net result, increased visibility which damn well ought to lead to increases in overall numbers just as it would for any diagnosis, psychological or otherwise.<p>Third, there isn&#x27;t much scientific evidence to support the idea that ADHD is overdiagnosed. Even in cases where patients don&#x27;t meet the diagnostic criteria, there&#x27;s a growing body of evidence that they nevertheless exhibit more symptoms than average. So even in those cases, they&#x27;re quite different than your idealized vision of regular kids being fed a daily diet of all the psychopharmaceuticals they can swallow.

This article is merely an example of how stone-age &quot;technology&quot; can perform a certain task.<p>I also take issue with the automatism of accusing &quot;political correctness&quot;. Nobody says civilizations are equal, there are numerous obvious differences. Somehow whenever I dig deeper and ask about what those people think, I get to hear/read profound racist undertones. The &quot;PC&quot; curse is really most common as a defense to accusations of racism.<p>The actual problem arises when people go on to make value-judgements along ethnical boundaries (racism). And then they go even further, using these not necessarily well founded judgements to pose &quot;scientific facts&quot; about how one ethnicity is genetically superior (because they believe all differences between two sets of humans have to come down to genetics/evolution)and thus are somehow entitled to more wealth than another ethnicity.<p>Their is no right to wealth and no birth right to it. That does not however imply a redistribution of wealth in the slightest way.<p>There are strong factors which contributed to the economic rise of Europe &quot;first&quot; and which have nothing to do with human genetics. Agriculture benefits from certain climates and soil conditions (ask the mayans about their collapse...). It also benefits a lot from domesticateable animals, and most animals are not nearly as well suited as for example horses and cows. Then the coastlines and rivers in Europe have shown to be much more conducive to commerce (before industrialization) than in Africa or America.<p>Systems are complex.

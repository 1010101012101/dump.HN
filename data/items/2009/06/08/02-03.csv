It makes sense to let your readers vote down the trollish comments.<p>On slashdot and reddit and even on digg, if you set your comment threshold to +5, what's left behind is pretty good conversation.  On HN, trollish comments are grayed out almost immediately.  What's most disappointing is that slashdot has had a comment karma system since '97.<p>Instead of complaining about the trolls, I'd prefer if they actually did something about it.",1244429902
646726,comment,645824,646680,0,0,bokonist,,,"Politics.  The political left is the faction of academia.  As institutions, the universities and the teachers unions wish to reallocate money to education spending [1].  To do so, they must simultaneously get people to believe two things: 1) that scholastic achievement is extremely important and 2) that everyone can achieve any scholastic goal.  Conversely, those on the right wish to debunk #2 so that politicians will stop reallocating money to academia, and instead allocate it to their favored causes.<p>Scholastic achievement is closely related to tested IQ.  The SAT is a not-so-thinly veiled IQ test.  Every American is taught by the educational establishment that both scholastic achievement and the SAT are very important to our future.  For the first twenty-two years of our life, we get graded continuously on scholastics, but rarely on character.  In all, we are raised to be obsessed about IQ, and we are caught in the midst of a political battle where trillions of dollars are at stake.<p>[1] Note - I do not impute cynical intent to the actual individuals comprising the educational institutions.  Institutions promote themselves via selection effects. True believers who believe what's good for Harvard is good for the country will fill the ranks of Harvard and enter leadership positions.  Cynics will find jobs elsewhere.  Thus an institution will fill with people who sincerely believe in promoting the institution, whether or not the institution actually is doing any good.  Thus the actions of an institution as a whole can be self-serving at the harm of the whole, while the individuals comprising it are sincere.  Other institutions besides academia have the same effect, see for instance, the 16th Century Catholic Church.",1244429874

If you sign up for it, you get setup in his Aweber autoresponder and you'll get the free e-course (hopefully) along with offers for the product he's selling.  He may just have switched to test the overall conversion rate through the whole pipeline and see if it's higher.  Often it'll better to hook people with a free offer and build trust over time, selling them multiple products, rather than trying to convert cold traffic to a sale up-front.<p>Also, I just want to point out that he's likely never made $400k in annual profit from this.  Not only was Cringely's estimate based on the $79 price that gets cut in half for a lot of the orders, but a lot of these guys give their affiliates 50 - 75%, plus he's probably paying for a lot of paid traffic.

The bar associations wanted to raise the barriers to entry to the profession, so they passed laws requiring a Law school degree.  Students then started taking correspondence courses.  The bar associations then changed the accreditation rules to mandate a minimum amount of classroom face time.  These artificial credentialing laws ended up hurting the poor.  Because before a student could study with books from a library card and become a lawyer.  Now he must pay a very expensive tuition bill.  Also, the artificial barriers to entry drive up wages for the credentialed professions, which means everyone has to pay more for doctors, legal help, etc.<p>Something like 30% of all jobs in the United States now have a legal credentialing requirement.

646682,comment,645824,646534,0,0,emmett,,,"Yes, I generally agree that it would be <i>theoretically possible</i> to do a separated at birth identical twin study. In practice, the requirements are so stringent that they've never (to my knowledge) been met.<p>The setup you describe could indeed separate genetic/genetic+environment feedback component from the purely environmental component. Albeit with caveats:<p>- Identical twins given up for adoption and then separated at birth are probably not drawn at random from the population.<p>- You can't draw any conclusions at all about which genetic variance is causing the issue, unless you restrict the demographic cross sections. So it can't possibly give you evidence that one race has a higher average IQ, for example.<p>-  The conclusions you draw may be much more about environmental feedback than genetics - maybe with a different environment, the differences will go away. For example, maybe you've found genes that code for susceptibility to iodine deficiency, and your society hasn't discovered iodized salt yet. In that case it's hard to say that you've determined the degree to which intelligence is ""genetic"" except in the most general sense.<p>In practice, locating identical twins separated at birth is <i>hard</i>. Finding a representative sample of them across demographic mix is harder. Doing it again for fraternal twins to control for womb environment makes it yet more work. I'm not sure how you control for the fact that the identical twins who are given up and then separated at birth are probably a different population from random adoptees, but I don't doubt with sufficient cleverness it could be done. The problem is that real twin studies almost always fail to control all these factors, and failing to control even one factor dooms your entire experiment.",1244426796

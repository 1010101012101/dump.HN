Awkward. Need to perform aggregate functions with group by, or add dynamically computed columns to the select? Impossible. Subqueries in the select? Nope. Need to order by a function? Impossible, too.<p>These libraries fail because they are not designed around a logical expression language (unlike Ruby&#x27;s ARel, a very nice SQL building library that forms the underpinnings of ActiveRecord). You need to be able to programmatically build expressions as an AST which still preserving SQL language rules and avoid exposing yourself to injection.",1401040779

This is old hat, especially if Iran were able to engage the Chinese.

You&#x27;re very rightly pointing out that if you make false use of your authority too often that you should expect people to not trust you in the future. But there was a second part to that story: Once the people stop trusting that authority entirely, they can be taken advantage of, just as the wolf did to the villagers&#x27; sheep.<p>As it stands your personal decision to be a conscientious objector is made possible only because enough other people did not make that same decision (a point Orwell makes much better than I can).<p>So while I won&#x27;t argue with that decision as it&#x27;s something only you can decide on, based on your own life experiences, I would also caution that <i>your</i> experiences are not <i>everyone else&#x27;s</i> experiences and so maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be so quick to judge other people.",1401040333

If you look at it as a pyramid, and the moment of a soldier shooting someone as the very tip, a LOT goes into that. There is a bit in Robert Antelme&#x27;s &quot;The Human Race&quot; where he actually says the supposedly innocent and righteous civil society, with its supposed values, that underpinned and enabled the SS at times stirred up more resentment than the SS itself; at least the SS wore skulls, and acknowledged the existence of the people they were murdering. I am paraphrasing, but my point is, even someone who lived through that horror agrees with you.<p>> And don&#x27;t forget that Einstein wrote the letter to the FDR that kicked off the race to build the atomic weapon. Even HE was asking for the USG to do something that would squelch the evil of Nazi aggression.<p><i>&quot;I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed that letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them!&quot;</i><p>&<p><i>&quot;Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in producing an atomic bomb, I would not have lifted a finger.&quot;</i><p>> If you believe that soldiers, airmen, sailors, and Marines are mindless drones, boy have you got it wrong.<p>This however strikes me as a non-sequitur.

However sometimes you just have to reject things that aren&#x27;t spec.<p>Not too long ago I was struggling with one of these CSV issues and received some good advice from Hans Passant [1] on a Stack Overflow question pertaining to my problem (emphasis mine):<p>&quot;It is pretty important that you don&#x27;t try to fix it. That will make you responsible for bad data for a long time. Reject the file for being improperly formatted. If they hassle you about it then point out that it is not RFC-4180 compatible. <i>There&#x27;s another programmer somewhere that can easily fix this.</i>&quot;<p>It makes perfect sense in hindsight.  If you accept a malformed CSV file, people will expect you to accept <i>any</i> malformed data that has a CSV extension.  You are taking on a lot of extra responsibility to cover for the lack of work by another programmer.  Odds are they can make a change to fix the problem that takes a fraction of the time it would take you work around it.  You just have to raise the issue.<p>I realize that rejecting bad files isn&#x27;t really possible in every circumstance.

I was gobsmacked to find that one section of it consisted of launching the same suite of 5-6 programs one time for each of our 25 locations.  And &quot;launching&quot; meant setting a handful of run-time variables, executing the object, waiting for it to finish running, and examining the result.<p>It was fairly easy to see why this happened.  That workflow was the heart and soul of the company&#x27;s revenue processing, and no one wanted to touch it any more than absolutely necessary, to avoid breaking anything.  So when they expanded from one warehouse to two, it made more sense to simply re-iterate the existing code with the new location id.  When they added another location, re-iterate it again, and so forth.<p>I created a Launch subroutine, then replaced all those hundreds of lines of code with a for loop that simply called the Launch subroutine for each object needed.    Then I went through the rest of the workflow and swapped in Launch calls where appropriate.  Overnight, that workflow became much shorter, more readable, and most importantly, significantly more maintainable.  Previously, if you wanted to change what programs were run per branch, you had to insert the launching logic in twenty-five separate spots.  Now? Once.<p><i>That,</i> my friends, is why we build functions, rather than copypasta-ing the same code over and over.",1401039140

I&#x27;ll disagree with a &quot;blame the victim&quot; mentality everywhere I see it, and you should too.<p>For instance, let&#x27;s consider a fictional city (perhaps Gotham). Cities need firemen, even though we all hope that our stringent building codes will keep fires from starting (or at least, keep them from spreading), improved safety technology helps people put out their own fires, etc. But none of these are foolproof, and the idea of an uncontrolled fire spreading through densely-constructed buildings is so horrific that we have no choice but to maintain a cadre of firemen. OK.<p>But eventually our building codes and safety technologies become so good that Gotham realizes that the biggest risk of a large conflagration is actually from a fire starting in the border city opposite, so Gotham signs up their firemen for &quot;mutual assistance&quot; and helps put fires out in their neighbors, under the catchphrase &quot;better to fight the fire there than have to fight it at home!&quot;. The logic seems to work, despite the number of firemen who die fighting these fires each year, and our neighboring cities are doing better at stopping fires too, so we sign up for mutual assistance with cities further and further away.<p>But larger and larger fires start to break out and worse, there are nasty and persistent rumors that those fires are actually being <i>started</i> by Gotham leaders, and even some of the firemen. Yet no one has completely solved the issue of fighting fires in Gotham, so the need to have some people with the training and skill to fight fires at home remains. And yet we don&#x27;t like the idea of shady people doing shady things to start fires abroad.<p>So who do you blame, the people who signed up to fight fires (possibly abroad, with good reasons), or the people starting the fires?",1401038986

But beyond that the issue is not at all as complicated as you think.<p>E.g. with Lt. Calley&#x27;s company, they were clearly guilty of not only crimes, but war crimes, yet there was a concerted effort in the U.S. and in the military leadership in Vietnam to cover the incident up. The issue there wasn&#x27;t about &quot;just following orders&quot;, the issue there was that the U.S. never attempted to put the criminals on trial in the first place, and that the eventual justice process that was meted out was so watered down. Even worse the Army and U.S. leadership tried to (and did) ruin the careers and lives of the 3 who actually followed their training as soldiers to put a stop to the massacre.<p>But you&#x27;ll note that Lt. Calley <i>was</i> eventually court-martialed, and despite consistently claiming that he &quot;just followed orders&quot; was found guilty, sentenced to life, and his sentence upheld on appeal. Of course, U.S. leadership gutted <i>that</i> too, and effectively commuted his sentence, but &quot;just following orders&quot; was very much put on trial in the U.S. system and shot down again.",1401038264

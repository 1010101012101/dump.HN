There would be many consumers that would choose Android equipment even if Apple lowered their pricing.  Then Apple would be competing, but without the war chest that allows them to, say, buy some chip companies and start designing their own chips or being able to pay in advance for parts and get a steep discount.  Plus, as you note, if they achieved 92% marketshare, they&#x27;d fall under heavy regulation.  This way, they&#x27;re able to get 92% of the profit, but there&#x27;s still significant competition to the point where Apple isn&#x27;t even the largest by number of devices.  It means that Apple doesn&#x27;t have the market power to dictate terms - most people don&#x27;t buy Apple equipment.  It must continue innovating and producing great things.  But it also means a lack of anti-trust attention since consumers have highly viable alternatives - alternatives that the majority of consumers worldwide use.<p>Similarly, there are certain industries that seem to be &quot;cool&quot; and people will try and compete in them regardless of profit.  Smartphones seems like such a market.  In a market where Apple and Samsung are the only two profitable makers and there&#x27;s little innovative new features coming out, people still want in.  I mean, Apple joined the smartphone market with a completely different design in the iPhone - no keyboard, capacitive multi-touch screen that dominated the phone, etc.  Today, it&#x27;s mostly polishing that formula introduced in 2007.  Why would you want to enter an industry where you&#x27;d just be taking a display, a chip from Qualcomm or MediaTek, and a pretty standard body and camera, pair that with Android, and ship what everyone else is shipping?  Are you doing anything better?  Unlikely.  And yet people want in even in the face of zero profits.  So, even if Apple wiped out the current competition, it&#x27;s likely that people would want in.  And companies like OnePlus have shown that it&#x27;s not terribly hard to join in the party.<p>Lowering margins probably wouldn&#x27;t help Apple over the long run.

I went through most of my school years ignoring as much homework I could get away with while still keeping good grades (the unspoken rule at home was that A-C were ok, anything below was unacceptable). I could learn a lot from just listening to the teacher during lesson and an occasional skimming on textbooks, and any significant effort that I put was just before important exams. This has served me well in some ways - I owe most of my general knowledge as well as the whole career to basically ignoring school and doing whatever the hell I wanted (it happened to be programming).<p>But then the university started, and by the third year I was in full panic mode, fighting fires. Not because things were hard, but because I&#x27;ve never learned the necessary endurance for systematic work (and powering through make-work bullshit). I ended up just with BSc, because I didn&#x27;t give my Masters thesis in time. I had probably the most ambitious project in the entire year, but I didn&#x27;t manage to wrap it up to into an acceptable Masters project (simultaneously working full-time at the time didn&#x27;t help).<p>The end result is, I didn&#x27;t learn discipline. The very things that enabled me to pursue software career are the things that are now seriously damaging my work output. That&#x27;s the flip side of going for what intrests you - the modern workplace is something where you mostly have to power through boring things. Being self-educated can actually make you misadapted to the society if you don&#x27;t learn some discipline along the way.<p>It&#x27;s funny - most of the people I worked along with were hard-working but struggling to become good programmers.

Is the whole strategy working or is it just making the whole region from Libya to Pakistan to Turkey less politically stable and more violent? It&#x27;s not an easy question to answer, but we&#x27;ve been doing it your way since 2001 and the situation has got worse. I&#x27;d like to propose the radical strategy of &quot;not killing people&quot; and see how it works out.&quot;<p>I feel like this is hard to quantify.  The thing is we are going to continue exploiting these regions and generally doing things that the people of these regions don&#x27;t like.<p>We can&#x27;t really have a live and let live policy where we keep fucking people over so I feel like that is kind of off the table.  On the other hand, there haven&#x27;t been any attacks on our soil or even high impact attacks really since we started blowing people up with robots.<p>If there was another high profile attack it would result in an intensely hawkish political environment where we would lose more civil rights and most likely blow up another country like Iraq.  That would really kill a lot of people.  So if blowing away a bunch of people in countries that barely have sovereignty keeps things in check then it isn&#x27;t really the worst plan.<p>It is really not worth talking about idealistic ideas about:\nA) not fucking over people\nB) not doing anything<p>option B is way too politically dangerous for our leaders anyway, and it is obvious that A isn&#x27;t going to happen.

His oeuvre is thus a kind of &quot;non-Gospel&quot; or <i>dys-angelion</i>-- a body of &quot;bad tidings&quot;; it testifies against the New Testament.

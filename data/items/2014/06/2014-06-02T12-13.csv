7833196,comment,7832209,7832476,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"There&#x27;s one environment in which an open-plan office makes sense: a trading desk. (I was a trader for a year.) That&#x27;s because 5 seconds means a lot on the markets. If millions of dollars can be lost per second, you can&#x27;t afford the Bell Labs culture.<p>However, on-the-desk quants and IT are genuinely respected for their sacrifice. Sure, they have to be highly available from 9:20 to 4:10, but the rest of the time is completely their own (usually for research; they tend to work 11-hour days not because anyone is making them, but because they love the work). They&#x27;re paid very well for that intense 7 hours, and no one would subject them to the humiliation of &quot;Agile&quot; micromanagement. Quants have traders come by to ask about trading strategies at high levels, but they don&#x27;t deal with PMs and &quot;story points&quot; and arguments about whether what they worked on over the past week was &quot;in the backlog&quot; or not. Quants have something much closer to an open allocation environment than most software engineers, and if they can&#x27;t hack the stress (and not everyone can, especially for years on end) of being on the desk, they&#x27;re usually moved to off-the-desk roles and the change isn&#x27;t stigmatized.<p>(Some will come in and say that quants are second-class citizens in hedge funds and, if one looks at 95th-percentile compensation, that appears to be true. Quants hit a ceiling around $500k-1.5M, which is 1% of what the best traders make, but they&#x27;re <i>respected</i>. On the other hand, non-managing programmers are <i>third</i>-class citizens in most Valley startups, and they aren&#x27;t making any money either.)<p>Open-plan offices make sense on trading desks, just as &quot;Agile&quot; makes sense for a small consulting firm on the make-or-break project that&#x27;ll take it into the big leagues (under which it&#x27;s reasonable to ask the tech staff to truly &quot;sprint&quot;, because delivering the project will result in a quantum leap in client relations, quality of work, and compensation). The problem is that management tends to take these processes that <i>conditionally</i> result in high performance (for a short while) and attempt to implement the costly, negative and painful aspects (e.g. open-plan offices and Scrum) while failing to deliver the upside (e.g. quant-level bonuses, genuine equity rather than 0.05% bullshit) that makes talented people willing to tolerate the pain.",1401713997
7833195,comment,7832672,7832847,16,0,kerkeslager,,,"Just so it&#x27;s clear: the median filter way of doing this doesn&#x27;t rely on finding two images with non-overlapping people, it uses the open spaces from all the images. As such, you don&#x27;t need an exponentially growing number of images.<p>You&#x27;ll still run into issues with two things:<p>1. Someone napping or being otherwise still throughout your photos will show up in the finished product.\n2. Systems which are stationary but put out a lot of internal movement (trees, video screens) will likely show up as random-colored pixels within the range of their colors. For trees this would look like a blur. For TV screens it would probably end up gray-ish or staticky.",1401713992

I only hope one day get the joy of understanding the roots of UNIX, the intention of Plan 9/Inferno, and the places it can be used outside of the PC world. I believe their major achievement is hardly the user interface or the driver support. Those are arcane measures of usefulness by today&#x27;s standards. The main point of Plan 9/Inferno is not about where it runs at all. The point is that wherever it runs, the communication between networked resources is no longer a matter of each device being an island onto itself. It is designed from the ground to allow for a mesh of storage, computation, display, and other devices. The target audience is not your regular PC user just yet. I think the late Dennis Ritchie, of UNIX and C fame, said that Plan 9, much like UNIX, will not be fully appreciated for another 20 to 30 years.",1401713511

Secondly geolocating Dave is almost certainly non-productive.  If you need to converse with Dave you call/text his phone to maximize productivity.<p>This is an insightful observation about the core values of open office vs alternatives... an open office simply isn&#x27;t interested in productive activity.  Its interested in non-productive activity, which has been proven over and over in scientific studies.<p>Its unpleasant, perhaps even inhumane for a large segment of the population, and unproductive for everyone but in a cause and effect relationship the bug is in the core values of the organization, that productivity doesn&#x27;t matter.  Its not that they don&#x27;t know its non-productive, its that they don&#x27;t care that its non-productive.<p>Also note you can&#x27;t fix that core value epic fail by merely generating a new, technically superior architectural fad.  You merely end up with an organization that&#x27;s non-productive that has really nice private offices.<p>In that way its kind of like a HOA...

7833167,comment,7832209,7832209,69,0,aeberbach,,,"Why stop at having an office merely &quot;open&quot;? Hot desking is the new thing - it&#x27;s nothing to do with cost saving, it&#x27;s all about &quot;flexibility&quot;. Except that your organisation might also have a policy against working from home. There&#x27;s no implicit message that you are simply a replaceable functional unit, not at all. You might even find there&#x27;s no desk left when you arrive at work - who doesn&#x27;t love the suspense of arriving for an oversold airplane? Now you can have that at work every single day!<p>Truly modern offices have hot desks AND are wired for teleconferencing - right in the open areas! That&#x27;s right, if &quot;open&quot; is good for communication then a 60&quot; screen on the wall with video cameras pointing at you is even better! You can share in the dull roar of collaboration with people on other continents ALL DAY! In the average open space you can fit at least two, maybe three such screens. When you have them installed, get the tradesmen to come during office hours. It costs way more if they come after hours and your employees should get the chance to see drills, saws and nailguns operated by professionals, they may learn something.<p>We all know there&#x27;s nothing that stimulates productivity like the sound of productivity, right? So when you plan your next office, leave the kitchen open too - the scrape of chairs on the tiles, the sound of the dishwasher being unloaded, the happy PING of the microwave - not to mention the aromas of hot food - all these things will make employees feel right at home. Using only the most modern materials in the office - lots of glass and steel - will ensure the entire workforce shares the joy. You don&#x27;t want to be damping the precious sound waves with carpet or plasterboard.<p>I wish I was joking.",1401713394

Most programmers use reasoning methods like operational modeling (single threaded), guess-and-check, and unit testing. These are simply completely insufficient.<p>If you want to model full distributed systems you might want to use something like algebraic topology. It&#x27;s a useful tool for understanding the entire state space of a system and its valid transitions. It can be used to prove Paxos or Raft are correct. <a href=""https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/33762/top_dc.pdf?sequence=2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/33762/...</a><p>Another method is to simplify a whole lot what a &quot;distributed system&quot; is and hope to find a more analyzable model where more standard reasoning tools work. CSP is one of these. It&#x27;s a simpler model where some of the reasoning tools of regular formal languages can be used to understand its operation.<p>The upshot is that CSP won&#x27;t be as powerful as you could imagine possible when building a distributed system, but it&#x27;ll be massively more manageable so long as its sufficient for your goals. It&#x27;s, as such, formed the basis for some popular distributed tools like Erlang.",1401711918

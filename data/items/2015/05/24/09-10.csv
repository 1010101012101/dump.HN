9595784,comment,9576917,9581411,0,0,simoncion,,,"So, I&#x27;m asking questions because I&#x27;m curious and very probably ignorant. I&#x27;m not trying to pick a fight, make points, or get in a dick-waving contest. I also don&#x27;t know how closely you follow btrfs development. I skim the lists from time to time, so if I&#x27;m telling you stuff that you already know, or if my memory is not quite correct, I apologize in advance. Also, if you notice this comment <i>after</i> the comment submission window closes, you can reach me at $MY_HN_USERNAME@gmail<p>What&#x27;s wrong with how compression works? From a user&#x27;s perspective, you either set a mount option, set a bit on a file attribute, or explicitly call for compression with btrfs defrag. [0] If you combine the latter two operations into a single checkbox, this is exactly how NTFS handles things. What am I missing here? Also, I can&#x27;t agree that modern[1] btrfs handles unexpected power cuts poorly. This just hasn&#x27;t been my experience. I <i>can</i>, however, agree that log replay isn&#x27;t complete and still needs work.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the ENOSPC bugs, I haven&#x27;t run into any in a very, very long time. Some time after 3.14, btrfs got a pool of space called the &quot;Global Reserve&quot; [2] which was intended to address ENOSPC issues. Somewhere around that time, btrfs also grew a better btrfs-specific df function invoked with &quot;btrfs filesystem usage&quot;. I don&#x27;t make extensive use of snapshots, but the numbers I get out of btrfs fi usage almost exactly match the numbers I get from plain old df.<p>I&#x27;m unware of snapshot automounting. Can you help me understand what this is? (A brief Google search wasn&#x27;t enlightening.) I agree that taking away the ability to have subvolumes outside the FS tree if you didn&#x27;t set things up just right at FS creation time is pretty bullshit. That certainly needs reworked. Everything else in my limited experience with subvol management seems okay to me. What&#x27;s seems strange to you?<p>Btrfs doesn&#x27;t yet have built-in online dedup, but are you aware of dupremove? [3]<p>Can you give me a recipe to create an N<i>(N-1)/2 sized random access file? I use BTRFS for some very small random-access databases and large pretty-much-append-only databases and haven&#x27;t run into this behavior.<p>I have a couple of things to say about your other comment:<p>People generally don&#x27;t write to a mailing list to say what a good time they&#x27;re having with your software.<p>It&#x27;s pretty shit that log replay isn&#x27;t worked out yet.<p>I </i>certainly* don&#x27;t intend to stop making backups. OTOH, I&#x27;ve been &quot;getting lucky&quot; for five years straight while running a FS that many people regard as the most untrustworthy thing in the world on a drive that many people regard as <i>entirely</i> unreliable and untrustworthy. :)<p>Cheers!<p>[0] Conceptually, this makes a lot of sense, &#x27;cause all defrag does is re-write the file. NTFS re-writes files when you request that they be compressed, too.<p>[1] &quot;Modern&quot; means btrfs from the past two years or so.<p>[2] Much like ext*&#x27;s reserved-for-the-superuser space.<p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/markfasheh/duperemove"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/markfasheh/duperemove</a>",1432460511

The app promises to keep the wifi keys secret from other users:<p>> &quot;... credentials are added to the database so that everyone else on the app can also use that hotspot. Users cannot actually view these credentials so as to protect user data.&quot;<p>But if a client app can download the wifi key from the server and use it to log in, then a <i>modified</i> client app could also download all wifi keys and show them to the user.<p>There is no practical way for the server to distinguish the original client app from a modified one as long as the user is in control of the hardware and OS it runs on.",1432458473

WPF is not exactly abandoned, but people who learned WPF to develop with it are somewhat bitter (and understandably so) about the experience, and about the transition to Windows 8 / phones / tablets.",1432458377

We were much closer to the hardware in those days-- you could have things like disks that wouldn&#x27;t work on some machines because the variance of the resistor in the disk drive caused a slight incompatibility when you tried to read data from a nonexistent track that only exists in the custom made disks the program originally came on but that doesn&#x27;t exist in the operating system (which formats the disk you put the program on when you copy)... and which most disks with custom assembly code can read, but your particular drive cannot.<p>In 2008 I spent 6 months going thru my Apple II collection, many of the disks had spent years in a garage in Louisiana and Texas.  Surprisingly most were still readable, but I lost some terrible poetry and equally terrible letters to my high school sweetheart (turns out she wasn&#x27;t so sweet as an adult.)<p>IF you have Apple // disks, or any kind of old format, I urge you to recover it NOW.  Time is not on your side.<p>I had a DEC Tape from the 1980s that eventually I think I just threw away because I couldn&#x27;t find anyone on the internet who could read the data.",1432458135

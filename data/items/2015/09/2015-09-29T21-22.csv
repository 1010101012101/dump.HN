At retirement age, you could pay an insurance company $100,000 in return for some $5,000-6,000 a year in guaranteed payments until you die. But most people don’t do that. For decades, economists have been trying to figure out why....James Poterba, an economics professor at MIT who has extensively studied American retirement, says it’s still a mystery why annuities are so unpopular. ...But there’s also some evidence that people just irrationally dislike annuities. As behavioral economist Richard Thaler wrote in the New York Times: “Rather than viewing an annuity as providing insurance in the event that one lives past 85 or 90, most people seem to consider buying an annuity as a gamble, in which one has to live a certain number of years just to break even.” ...  Here is where tontines come in. If people irrationally fear annuities because they seem like a gamble on one&#x27;s own life, history suggests that they irrationally loved tontines because they see tontines as a gamble on other people&#x27;s lives.<p>Right, so the answer is completely known, and now we&#x27;re just speculating on what weird financial device will best play to people&#x27;s economic ignorance.  Luckily, the author sounds almost as confused, since you couldn&#x27;t have a handle on economics and write this:<p>> Retirees often object to annuities because they worry about not living long enough to make the money back. This is the nightmare scenario: If someone dies the day after she buys an annuity, the insurance company walks away with the cash scot-free. In a tontine, that money passes on to help fund other people&#x27;s retirements.",1443562836

The costs stem in part from paying the insurance company to shoulder all the risk. To guarantee it can make good on all its annuity contracts, the insurer has to set aside a lot of money in reserve — just in case people live longer than expected, or in case the market crashes. A tontine does away with all that overhead, so more money is available to the retirees. By Milevsky&#x27;s calculations, a tontine might offer a 10 percent to 20 percent premium over an annuity — a bigger pie to be divided among the group. The downside is that retirees would see their payouts fluctuate depending on the various times other people in the tontine group died. Compared to an annuity, a tontine abandons certain payouts for much higher returns...Such a system would be cheaper to operate and would always, by definition, be fully funded. The funny thing is that some retirement systems already carry out a version of that process. As Milevsky documents in his book, there is &quot;tontine thinking&quot; embedded in various national pension schemes, and even in a product offered by TIAA-CREF in the United States. These plans adjust payments according to mortality. They just don&#x27;t use the word tontine.",1443562697

Sure, it is on the top tier $750 and up premium-priced phones like the iPhone 6s (which has very fast internal storage).  But we&#x27;re talking about a <i>much</i> less expensive phone here.  Let&#x27;s compare:<p>64GB Nexus 6P: $549<p>64GB iPhone 6S+: $849<p>So, you really shouldn&#x27;t expect the Nexus 6P to be using the top-tier internal storage solutions Samsung rolls out as used in the iPhone and Samsung phones.  Yes, a lot of that $300 price difference is for the Apple name, especially when you factor in the lower resolution 6S+ 1080p screen.  But quite a bit of it is used for the polishing bits that make the phone faster... like much faster storage.<p>As a data point, the high-end Sandisk 64GB microSD cards are about $50 and are around 3x faster than the internal storage in my Nexus 6.  They&#x27;re hitting 95 MB/s read, 90 MB/s write now.<p>While a microSD won&#x27;t top out at the 200 MB/s you get from last year&#x27;s top-tier storage available in the Samsung S6 and iPhone 6 (not to mention the twice as fast Samsung storage in the new iPhone 6s and upcoming Samsung phone), they&#x27;ll perform better than the internal storage in most mid-tier phones and all low-tier phones, which is all most folks need for photos and videos.",1443562550

She brought those things to the table as part of her contribution and he paid the bills. Division of labor.<p>Women who are college educated, good looking, etc. do not de facto have awesome relationship skills. In fact, you can sort of bet on the idea that if they put their career first, they have probably given short shrift to such things.<p>The assumption that women who are educated and have successful careers make &quot;great catches&quot; flips the historical standard that what made a man a great catch was his career (not just for the money, but also for the kind of lifestyle that came with the career -- the social circles you run in, among other things) and in order for this to work, men would need to take over the role of tending the relationship: the cooking, the cleaning, being supportive and a good listener, etc.<p>And that means women would need to start looking for men who invest in that more than their career. They would need to start marrying down.<p>In essence, the assumption that a woman is a great catch if she has a serious career only works if men are willing to take over the role of &quot;wife&quot; by the droves and the career women are willing to make that deal. Most women still want men who are their equal or superior in terms of career success and income, as the article makes clear.<p>This isn&#x27;t a shortage of men. It is a legitimately hard problem to solve to have two career people hook up and also make the personal life part work. A two career couple with kids and a social life, etc. -- there are only so many hours in the day. So this tends to not work.<p>I have read many, many articles wondering how to make this work and, for me, I think the answer is &quot;My kids are grown adults and I am hitting menopause, so no more babies for me.&quot; That means it gets a lot more realistic for me to have a career and also a man in my life with a real career. When you are looking to have a family and make sure all members of the family are properly cared for, it&#x27;s wicked hard to also have both parents pursuing a serious career with the pedal to the metal.<p>So I would say these women are choosing career over private life and the law of large numbers mean some of them will just have that career they put everything into. I get why women make that choice. I get why it is hard to be financially dependent upon a man, etc. I did the homemaker and full time mom thing. I know how hard that is. But when push comes to shove, if you just have other priorities, you simply may not get to this one thing that is lower on your list of priorities. Duh.",1443560842

Which among other things means that the government will genuinely try to fight corruption (this hasn’t happened so far), red tape will be significantly reduced, corrupted public servants will go to jail and their properties will be confiscated etc. There is a huge mistrust between citizens and public sector and this up to a point motivates people to not pay what they should.<p>Of course from a certain perspective this can be perceived as a poor excuse to justify tax avoidance but as always the truth lies in the middle. In Greece there is no sentiment for common good, each one is on his own and that reflects in the way we perceive our obligations to the country. We’ll pay up to the point that we’ll have no problem with the law. If tax laws are not too strict, which was the case up to a few years ago,  then people will look the other way.<p>Fortunately, the memorandum is forcing the government to take certain steps in solving many of those issues.

I have seen so many college graduates, who've spent four years taking classes and passing exams, who still can't program.  Programming is a craft.  You learn it mostly by writing real code.  If you lack the craft knowledge, the deep, theoretical insights are just words.",1253840304

Unless you've paid them for an API that you didn't receive, they haven't conned you.<p><i>I don't think you know what the value of free and open software is.</i><p>I'll hazard a guess: It's free, and also anybody's able to improve it if they want. I've only got five years' experience with open source, though, so perhaps I'm still an amateur at this.<p><i>To clarify one other point. Ubuntu has already reverse-engineered Dropbox (as Ubuntu One), so if Dropbox's profit relies on their having the sole access to the magic formula, it's already too late. Anything can be (and generally will be) reverse engineered. I don't think that closing off the source is a royal road to success.</i><p>So they use Dropbox's exact code? Or are you saying that they saw what Dropbox did and decided to copy it? Because that's not reverse engineering.<p>Funny story: Once upon a time I thought that open source would lead to everything getting better. I thought Firefox, for instance, would just continue to be an unstoppable beast because, after all, anybody who wanted to could make it do anything any other browser did. Then I realized Firefox was slow and ugly on the Mac, moved to the closed-source Safari,  and enjoy its incredibly sleek design. It was around the time I stopped using Ubuntu because I realized the closed-source OS X was better. Now that Windows 7 is spreading, I think Ubuntu's dropped to my third-favorite OS.<p>The problem with your line of thinking is that open source doesn't pay. The best people in certain fields, meanwhile, only work for money, and occasionally only for large gobs of money. That includes interface designers, and a lot of the people who work on fixing the ugly problems that nobody really likes working on. So open source's downfall is that it can't compete with the quality and focus of closed-source. It's the problem with democracy, so to speak.<p>I like open source for some things. I still haven't found an open-source application that's as cutting-edge as its closed equivalents. Even Quicksilver left me dissatisfied until I discovered the Google-sponsored Quick Search Box.",1253840253

842580,comment,841570,841842,0,0,bkovitz,,,"TDD is not a tool for preventing errors, although it has that effect.  It's primarily a way to use the computer to help you design.  It's an attention-helper.<p>Here are two things you have to do when programming: start with a problem that is somewhat vaguely specified and flesh it out, and break problems down into very tiny subproblems.  We all have lots of ways of doing those things: talking with another programmer, writing things down in a notebook, writing a little bit of throwaway code to flesh out an idea or convince yourself that it works.<p>TDD gets the computer involved in that process.  You can't solve the whole problem this minute, but you can bite off a piece.  Saying, ""I'll write a little unit test for this"" means you're not just thinking, you're really seeing how your approach works.  You're getting very clear.  Now suppose you find that something is hard to test.  This is often a sign that it's coupled to the rest of the system in a bad way. When you have a lot of tests, you can try out new ideas very quickly and see if you've overlooked something, or quickly get an idea of how much code needs to change to accommodate the new idea.<p>A big benefit of TDD is that it leads you to write much simpler code than you otherwise would.  I don't expect my say-so to convince you of this; it's just something you have to play with and see for yourself.  Many times, I've found that something like an <i>if</i> statement was all I actually needed to accomplish something that looked like it was going to be hard.  I found the simple way because I wrote the test first.  Sometimes, the resulting code doesn't feel like ""I"" wrote it.  It has a strangely minimalist quality.<p>The biggest benefit of TDD, though, is as a tool for communication within a team.  When pairing, the unit tests make very clear what the current problem is.  When understanding someone else's code, the unit tests make very clear how you're supposed to call some code.  When you modify someone else's complex code, well, that's when you really start to value unit tests.  The unit tests store knowledge of the program in a way that humans can understand and the computer can verify.<p>Of course TDD does not solve all problems.  It's just a neat tool, which often produces simpler code than you could write ""by yourself"".  You should know what it's for, though.  It's a design helper, not a QA department.  If it's not helping you design better, then you shouldn't use it.",1253838092

Dropbox could charge based off an upload metric similar to Evernote (which gives 40 MB of transfer  free a month).<p><a href=""http://www.evernote.com/about/premium/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evernote.com/about/premium/</a><p>While that model more closely aligns to bandwidth costs, I think dropbox is in a different market. For one, Dropbox is competing with external hard drives. It's easier to understand the value proposition when you can compare based on storage.<p>I sure as hell have no idea how much 40 MB is in terms of use. I do some word docs and some pictures. If I do 5 saves an hour, averaging 10 kb in size and I work for 40 hours a week, is 40 MB enough storage?",1253837343

And if the car is going so slowly that there's no sound at all, then there's plenty of time for a driver to stop if they see someone entering the street.",1253837266

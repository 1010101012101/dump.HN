There&#x27;s many cases (at least in the US and Europe) of fisherman organising themselves to avoid an entire ecosystem collapse.<p>We have done that for rivers (which had gone dry) in the US already, but selling property rights (or exploitation rights instead of property) for water zones could help prevent the overexploitation of sea resources. Once you own the zone or the exploitation rights, it&#x27;s all in your interest to actively limit fishing in order to keep the value of your property over the long term. Trusting fishermen to limit themselves is a nice idea, but incredibly naive. In the mediterranean, there are strict limits for tuna exploitation and they are violated every single year by these fishermen, and not enforced properly.",1421384056

So for example, a very bad model that has similar training and test errors does not overfit, and hence generalizes, according to the way I use these concepts. It follows that generalization is easy to achieve whenever the capacity of the model (as measured by the number of parameters or its VC-dimension) is limited --- we merely need to use more training cases than the model has parameters / VC dimension. Thus, the difficult part is to get a low training error.&quot;",1421383861

Its why food stamps and unemployment make sense.<p>On the other hand, what would exit from a country without another country to go to mean?<p>> A huge wave of unskilled immigration is practically certain to weaken the US enough to increase, not reduce, the number of places like North Korea that are outside the US&#x27;s military reach.<p>> Chinese and Indian &quot;right to pursue happiness&quot; has very little to do with US mass immigration policy; trade policy, technology transfer, Pax Americana, and the like have been far more relevant for a long time.<p>We&#x27;re debating morality here, which is subjective, but I&#x27;m not stupidly deontological. If open borders leads to a world which I rank lower morally than a world without then restrictive borders it is.<p>In general, I feel valuing a person differently depending on which state they&#x27;re born in is immoral, similar to judging them by race.<p>i.e. 2 similar individuals who are both skilled, both want to work and are both being hired should not be treated differently depending on which state controls their passport. On the other hand geographical distance, cultural ties etc are obviously valid points of difference.<p>-----<p>> And even your &quot;extreme example&quot; fails spectacularly.  I am Chinese, I voluntarily work for a Chinese-owned company, I&#x27;ve spent most of the last four years in and next to Shenzhen, and these years have been very good to me.<p>An uncharitable interpretation, I&#x27;m quite happy where I&#x27;m working too but I&#x27;d still rather be unemployed in the US than in India.<p>Edit:<p>temujin is right, restating<p>I&#x27;d rather be unemployed in the US than employed as a low level Foxconn employee in China",1421383656

The features are either passed through a softmax layer or used as a &quot;siamese&quot; network. (Siamese networks provide a similarity metric as opposed to a probability distribution over labels.[3])<p>As far as recognition goes, most modern algorithms don&#x27;t use fiducials (what you call &#x27;nodal points&#x27;) to do recognition. So there&#x27;s nothing in our code that has to do with interocular distance or mouth width, etc., so all of the features are &quot;learned&quot;. However, fiducials are used to do a frontalization or re-alignment step before passing it through the feature extractor (neural network or otherwise).

Class action litigation has a number of problems, partly because plaintiffs&#x27; attorneys working pure contingency have little incentive to see claims all the way through, and partly because judges and juries are skeptical of claims against large, respected companies.<p>In this case, there were a number of challenges. The first of which was that the DOJ settled with a slap on the wrist.[1] That&#x27;s a very strong signal to both the court and jurors that the claims aren&#x27;t a slam-dunk. Second, remember that in a civil case you don&#x27;t just have to prove that the defendant did something wrong. You have to prove every element of the often multi-facted claim. Finally, there&#x27;s a lot of back-and-forth with experts. Defendants can afford to hire the world&#x27;s leading economists to say that the damages were less than claimed. Plaintiffs will have experts, but they&#x27;re unlikely to be able to front the money for them to do as thorough a job.<p>$412 million would be over 10% the plaintiffs&#x27; experts estimated damages of $3 billion. That&#x27;s not an atypical recovery in a class action settlement.<p>[1] Contrast this to the LCD price fixing cases, where the DOJ&#x27;s levying $500+ million in fines resulted in big civil settlements.",1421381867

And that would demonstrate that ultimately the system stays in balance. And that ultimately the planet doesn&#x27;t really care about us at all.<p>That said then, do we as a species kill off our own fishermen? It has been estimated by some [1] that less than 2 billion people can live on the planet in &quot;harmony&quot; (what ever that means) so do we go kill off the other 4 - 5 billion losers? And then take up residence in caves?<p>Or do we focus on harnessing the energy and technologies we need to support as many people as we would like and to move them to other planet too? Ultimately someone has to tell the general population that whether it is humans, an asteroid, a volcano, or something else this place is a death trap and we better get working on a plan to go elsewhere.<p>[1] <a href=""http://na.unep.net/geas/archive/pdfs/geas_jun_12_carrying_capacity.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://na.unep.net/geas/archive/pdfs/geas_jun_12_carrying_ca...</a>",1421381601

HTTP is a moronic spec, and it allows inane things. For instance, these are valid HTTP headers:<p><pre><code>  X-LineWrap: Hi my name is\n       Header Boy\n</code></pre>\nThe value of X-LineWrap should be &quot;Hi my name is Header Boy&quot;. Edit: Actually I&#x27;m not sure if the space before the comment counts or not. Terrible text protocol formats FTW.<p><pre><code>  X-Comment: This is the value (but this is a comment!)\n</code></pre>\nThe value of X-Comment should be &quot;This is the value&quot;.<p><pre><code>  X-MoreFun: I don&#x27;t recall (offhand) how\n    this header value should\n    (really, the spec is a mess)\n    be interpreted.\n</code></pre>\nThe value of X-MoreFun should be (I think): &quot;I don&#x27;t recall how this header value should be interpreted.&quot;.<p>So, you might get lucky if they have a non-compliant parser and the target site has a compliant parser.

This should only apply to special-cased built-in headers. But you could try sending multiple X-UIDH headers, with commas in the values, to trick an overly ambitious parser. Maybe.<p>Anyways, this all depends on bugs in HTTP parsers, which probably exist. (Can you tell I despise the HTTP format?)

We were a huge, fat-ass company with 5000 programmers working on the same project and managed this.  90 days is a lifetime to fix a security problem.<p>The point behind having a deadline before publicly disclosing is that if one person has discovered a security problem, then some other people probably have as well.  It is fair enough to give vendors time before you make disclosure but if the vendor is moving too slowly -- for whatever reason -- you want to give the consumers a chance to implement their own security work around.  Because if you don&#x27;t they are vulnerable.<p>Giving Microsoft 90 days to fix an issue is fine.  They can prioritize it anyway they want. If they think it is super urgent, they can almost certainly get a fix out.  If they think it is not so urgent, then they don&#x27;t have to make a fix -- but they know that the problem will be disclosed.<p>Nowhere in Google&#x27;s documentation of this problem do I see a massive issue.  Google gave MS 90 days.  MS found a fix but there was another bug so they couldn&#x27;t meet the window.  Google released the information.

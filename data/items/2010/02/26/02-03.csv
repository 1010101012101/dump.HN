1152215,comment,1151447,1151713,0,0,pedrocr,,,"From the info it does seem that for this specific failure mode the Boeing design is better. That may be true for other types of failures too. But from what I've read before the Airbus system of software checks/info on pilot inputs can actually prevent a great deal of failure situations as well. The description of the Hudson landing not long ago included references on how the A320 helped the pilot maintain the optimum glide path and generally fly the plane better even in a much degraded situation. I also remember an article that detailed some accidents or near-misses and the Airbus system got mixed reviews, in that sometimes it was better than a conventional one, sometimes worse.<p>It's easy to have a gut reaction to these things. It sounds like the story for all kinds of advanced technology. Something solves a bunch of common failure modes while adding risk to extreme cases that are hard to test. On balance it may be a positive change and save lives but we are understandably uncomfortable when we see the freak accidents caused. Would you still prefer the Boeing planes if Airbus had a better safety record? They seem to be doing slightly better according to this:<p><a href=""http://www.boeing.com/news/techissues/pdf/statsum.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boeing.com/news/techissues/pdf/statsum.pdf</a><p>Looking at ""Hull Loss Accident Rate per Million Departures"" (page 21) for recent planes:<p>- 737-300/-400/-500: 0.54<p>- 747-400: 0.53<p>- A320/321/319/318: 0.36<p>- A340: 0.5 (this is a single accident)<p>- A330: 0 (this only goes to 2008, would have to be updated)<p>I haven't done the math to see if this is statistically significant.

1152203,comment,1152113,1152113,0,0,patio11,,,"Ooh, that sounds fun.<p>In terms of process design, I think you could take a hint or two from the Netflix guys here.  Currently you're distributing a single test case.  That takes very little work to accomplish: good first step!  Consider creating two test cases: one we'll call the probe case, and one we'll call the real case.  The real case is kept on your servers and never gets exposed directly to the participants.<p>Make a really freaking simple way for you to check your work on the probe case automatically, without needing to speak to you guys.  For example, you could make a simple REST API or even a web page with an upload/submit button.  Then run whatever your evaluation function is against the submitted solution for the probe case, and tell folks how good their submission was.  For an extra ten minutes of work you can add a leaderboard.  (Add a leaderboard!)  You can optionally rate-limit this if you're worried about people overfitting to the probe via taking a lot of measurements.<p>This has a better user experience and will get you more viral exposure because a) you've now totally decoupled your ability to run code from people's ability to participate in the contest and b) people can now get immediate feedback that their participation is valued and producing results.  Including a leaderboard also gives folks an emotional hook both for participating and for spreading word of your contest: ""Oh cripes guys, the top submission for this problem was done in Ruby.  Let's show them the awesome power of functional programming.  For the greater glory of Lisp!""<p>Of course, you can feel free on putting whatever restrictions you want on code which you individually invite for offline exposure to the real test case.",1267151264

Unfortunately history (or even a cursory examination of the world today) clearly shows that, in the public and private sectors alike, employees are inevitably abused when they do not stand up for themselves.<p>The real world isn't black and white.  Unions can do harm, to be sure, but a balance must be struck between the needs of the employer--public or private--and the needs of the employees, and it's never as simple as saying ""we shouldn't have unions"".<p>For instance, in my local school district, the superintendent is being criticized for seeking a raise in the middle of budget cuts.  Among his most vocal critics have been the teachers.  In response to their criticism, the superintendent proposed new rules that would effectively require teachers to take dozens of hours of useless(1) ""technology training"" on their own time, without pay; thankfully we have a union capable of protecting teachers against such abuse.<p><i>(1) Literally, useless.  These courses are part of an ongoing initiative the only point of which, as near as I can tell, is so the superintendent can say X number of teachers have participated in Y number of hours of additional training under his reign.  The teachers who already have a clue about computers get nothing from these courses; and unfortunately, the courses are so poorly designed that those who actually do have a thing or two to learn get nothing out of them, either.</i>",1267151116

Sometimes preferred will be non-participating preferred, and the investors can choose between getting their money back <i>or</i> converting their preferred to common and getting a share equal to their ownership.  Never ever will a VC do a deal where they don't get at least 100% of their money back before common stock holders (aka you) see a dime.<p>Complicating this is that 'getting their money back' is actually just a 1x liquidation preference - and while 1x is common (the VCs get 1x their money back before you get anything), it's possible for this preference to be higher.  If there's a 2x liquidation preference, the VCs get 2x their money back before the common gets anything.  If there's a 2x liquidation preference and the stock is fully-participating preferred, the VC gets 2x their money back and then a share of whatever's left equal to their ownership.<p>Early-stage rounds are often relatively simple and more 'rational' - it's multiple rounds with many different investors that make things interesting.<p>Brad Feld's 'Term Sheet Series' is the best resource I know of for basic definitions of all this stuff:\n<a href=""http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/term_sheet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/term_sheet/</a>",1267150959

I have one nitpick though, which is the advice to leave blog comments everywhere and to relentlessly tell all of your friends about your startup.<p>That surely cannot hurt, but the return on investment of posting comments on a site is minute.  I mean, I am addicted to commenting on HN and other sites daily and it is a lot of fun, but the notion that this is actually a good use of time for my startup is wishful thinking.<p>I would never expect to get a single customer from this.  I think getting an article on TechCrunch is of debatable value... but the traffic you'd get from a comment underneath an article from people checking out your profile link is miniscule.<p>Regarding telling your friends -- again, it doesn't hurt, but it is thinking really small and is not sustainable.  That might be a good strategy for winning a minor student council election, but the ROI is going to be utterly negligible.  Basically, you could spend a week phoning everyone you know and convince them to check out your site.  If you're lucky, this would roughly equal the amount of traffic you would get by having a moderately influential person spend 30 seconds writing a tweet about you.",1267150353

I am shocked that A380s can land in crosswinds at all.<p>There is also no non-synthetic force-feedback; if the computers don't think there is force, you don't feel any force.  (Actually, I'm not sure there is <i>any</i> feedback on the Airbus.  But I have only seen video demonstrations of the FBW system.)  On mechanical or hydraulic flight controls, you can feel the control surfaces not moving because ... you can't move them.  (I believed this helped the pilots of Alaska Airlines 261 realize what was happening. Everyone died anyway, but at least the pilots knew what was wrong...)<p>I assume if the software totally fails, the plane is simply uncontrollable.  I can't believe it would be designed that way, but I can't imagine how you are going to move the control surfaces either.  (The software doesn't even have to fail; it could just ignore your input.  I believe that some inputs are ignored in normal operation anyway, so this could just be a simple bug.)<p>Anyway, FBW scares me... but I am not a pilot or airplane designer.",1267150125

From their FAQ:<p>""Documents uploaded to crocodoc are assigned a unique, unguessable URL (e.g. <a href=""http://crocodoc.com/gQlo2g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crocodoc.com/gQlo2g</a>), which you can selectively share with others you wish to collaborate with.<p>For added security, crocodoc Pro users have the option of password-protecting their documents, which are uploaded and viewed using bank-grade SSL encryption. Companies interested in running crocodoc behind their firewall can contact us to request more information on intranet deployments.""<p>This is insufficient security for any serious business application.  Nothing about data encryption at rest.  Nothing about link expiration.  Nothing about the authentication used for password protection.  Running behind a firewall has nothing to do with the security of data once it is transmitted.<p>2.  The format seems to be proprietary.  Call me crazy, but if I'm investing the time and energy into marking up documents, I want to take them away in a portable, editable format.  Maybe I missed this point on their site?",1267150072

6261442,comment,6258231,6258231,4,0,paulgerhardt,,,"Crowdtilt (and by extension, Crowdhoster) sets the standard for crowdfunding <i>commercial</i> projects and represents a maturation of the of crowdfunding movement.<p>When we launched the Lockitron campaign last year we had no idea if going off platform (i.e. not using Kickstarter) would work. What we found is using a self-hosted crowdfunding solution has a number of benefits which make it a better option than using Kickstarter or Indiegogo.<p>1) You capture long tail traffic. Launch day press directs to your site, and you can continue making sales after your campaign closes. For customers not willing to provide payment information you can still capture leads with an email signup. I won&#x27;t disclose numbers here but this is hugely significant. There is a reason it is point number 1.<p>2) Order creation dovetails nicely into account creation. Managing shipping and payment information after a campaign closes is hugely stressful but can be even more so if you have to go through an intermediary that limits access. Getting people to create an account independently and as a second action months after they purchased the product but before it ships is unnecessarily painful.<p>3) You control look and feel. Not just important for establishing brand, but also for A/B testing, retargeting, and meaningful analytics.<p>4) Mitigate risk. You select your payment processor or can use multiple if necessary. A handful of crowdfunding campaigns have been torpedoed for both legitimate and illegitimate reasons. Kickstarter capped Lifx&#x27;s raise a few days into the campaign after a few negative media pieces saying the company could not deliver what it promises, citing Phillips $5 million R&D expenditures as proof. At this point in time it appears Lifx is on track to deliver, but it is unfortunate that they had their knees cut out from under them. It is not unimaginable that your own campaign could be threatened by a spurious patent troll.<p>5) No arbitrary guidelines. In order to make an honest effort to be a donation site and not a pre-order site, Kickstarter prohibits you from &quot;selling&quot; items or offering &quot;rewards&quot; in bulk. These linguistic gymnastics get in the way of clear communication and prevent you from capturing multiple purchases. Lifx for example was only allowed to &quot;reward&quot; backers with a single lightbulb rather than allowing them pre-order multiple as most people would expect to do when buying lightbulbs.<p>6) Less risky than you would think. At this point there have have been a number of $1 million+ self-hosted crowdfunding campaigns. See Lockitron, Soylent, MYO, and Tile.<p>When people ask about building their own crowdfunding solution I point them at Crowdhoster. They have taken the work we did when we released our Lockitron crowdfunding code (Selfstarter) and turned it into the standalone solution it needs to be.<p>If you are crowfunding a company which needs to capture long term users and not launching a weekend project, self-hosting your campaign is the way to go.",1377226704

User agent strings are, to put it mildly, a clusterfuck.<p>First off, they identify browsers, not features. If a user disables JS, you can&#x27;t detect that.<p>Worse, you would need know every UA string out there. This is, of course, impossible when a new browser shows up. And even if it weren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not an elegant way to handle the situation of different browsers having different features. You&#x27;re either going to have to do a separate code path for every version of every browser you support, or you&#x27;re going to have to create a dictionary on your server to tell you what features are supported for each UA string, and then essentially do progressive enhancement on the server side. At that point, you&#x27;re going through an awful lot of effort to do the work on the server instead of the client, with no clear net gain.<p>But the problem of new browsers is worse still. When existing browser vendors release a new version, they don&#x27;t want all of the new features they added to be ignored by sites that rely on the UA string. And when someone makes a new browser, they don&#x27;t want it to have everything disabled on every site it renders. So they go to elaborate lengths to load down the string with as much crazy as possible to trick sites into misidentifying them as existing modern browsers.",1377225078

You presented a list of reasons why JS is superior, and many of those were true of Basic at the time it was popular.<p>2.  You can load Basic programs instantaneously.  They&#x27;re interpreted, and the interpreter came with the operating system or even the computer&#x27;s hardware.  How is JS any more instantaneous?  You didn&#x27;t have to type in a whole Basic program every time you wanted to run one - I&#x27;m guessing this is the confusion here.<p>3.  There were no plugins.  That&#x27;s all that claim 3 ever was.  I don&#x27;t know how typing in a program by hand is relevant at any rate.  Surely every program has to be typed in by hand, unless you&#x27;re doing visual programming.<p>6.  I thought this was about Basic itself, which did not take a team of 20 engineers four years to develop.  As for applications, at the time it was really simple to program in compared to something like C.<p>So it comes down to 4, 5, 7.  These aren&#x27;t true of Basic, but they don&#x27;t necessarily make JS a winner:<p>4. Basic programs were portable to machines that had interpreters, and there were lots of them.  But sure, it probably wasn&#x27;t as portable as JS, as I don&#x27;t know if you could run it on a mainframe.  C is a very portable language though, and always has been, so why does this mean JS wins?<p>5.  Improvements in accessibility compared to the 80&#x27;s applies to all technology.  How is the disability support in JS better than other languages?<p>7.  Home computers were IN YOUR FUCKING HOUSE! at the time Basic was popular.  But non-Basic programs ran on those computers too, just like non-JS programs run on your phone.  Miniaturization benefits all languages.",1377224069

For the few home runs each year, oftentimes a bunch of the success can be attributed to aid provided by some of the VCs. They may provide value between seed and an A round since the investors often matter less there, but one there is a provable business model after A or after B, the investor, if chosen correctly, can be a big multiplier of value, especially for first time entrepreneurs.<p>Good VCs like A16Z, help with hiring, provide great signaling to potential partners, potential hires and future investors, and well as helping refine the business model.<p>Seems like any score they ascribe to a company would have to incorporate the value of each of their clients. e.g. the scores given to A16Z would look different from VenRock, since the compatibilities between the startup and the VC matter. VenRock is likely to multiply the value of a health-related startup in a way that most other VCs can&#x27;t and this changes things.<p>I&#x27;d even go as far as saying that for some VCs the partner you get should be factored into the scores as well.",1377223511

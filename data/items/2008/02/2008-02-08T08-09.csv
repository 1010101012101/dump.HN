111928,comment,111398,111419,0,0,ardit33,,,"Lived in Davis sq, and I can say it can get pretty boring after a year. Cambridge is nice.   Climate sucks. I mean cold is bearable, by i couldn't stand the lack of light.  I got winter's blues in there.  Locals suck. You will never learn the names of your neighbors.  Students everywhere, which gets annoying after a while.  Stupid puritanism everywhere.  The 24hr store in Davis sq. closes at midnight, b/c the city doesn't want people to work past midnight.  Alcohol is heavily regulated.  Heck, there even are no happy hours. (they are illegal).  and they call themselves liberals?  Ah, and racism is rampant.  I had a black girlfriend for a while, so I know.<p>I liked the boat house, in the Charles river, were you could register for $120/year, and learn how to sail. The urban transport is pretty good  (better than bay area).<p>For me it was good for a year or two, and then it ended up being boring.  Moved to SF, and my quality of life improved a lot.  people are just way much friendlier in here.<p>edit. there are a lot of biotech jobs around there (in Cambridge mostly). Lot's of tech jobs, but it is mostly big coorporations, and nothing too exiting.  Few startups, but no near the number of startups in SF bay area.  But housing is cheaper, about %30 cheaper,  but still very expensive (third most expensive area, after NYC, and SF).  And you can meet lot's of smart people, with masters, phd's, etc.  More intellectual than the bay area.",1202460745

But, I started programming at 11 when I first got paid for my programming skills. I've worked in the ""real world"" each summer and have found my hacking abilities more useful than many other skills.<p>Sometimes it's a php script to scrape data, other times it is a vb macro to make excel work more efficiently or a bash script, etc. etc.",1202460287

Unless you were either 1 Rich, 2.Cashed out huge amount of option shares 3.Gettin in debt out of your eyeballs,  it is hard to afford a decent house with a normal salary.  I like Berkeley, and SF, but still, living around in here is very expensive.",1202459988

111918,comment,111398,111599,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Agree with all of the above. Cool to see another Austinite here.<p>Austin has all the ingredients to be a great place for startups, with maybe the exception of a good investor climate. VC money seems dried up except for Austin Ventures, and the angels are conservative by SV standards. But regardless, its just about my favorite place.<p>Please shoot me an email if you'd ever like to chat startups (email in my profile)",1202459508

I was surprised when I saw it actually work.<p>Also cool is Shazam Entertainment's music recognition software. <a href=""http://www.shazam.com/music/portal/template/pages/p/company_profile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shazam.com/music/portal/template/pages/p/company_...</a><p>Apparently, if you hear something on the radio or whatever, you dial up shazam and they can tell you what it was.

I don't have it running in the background, and starting it takes about 20 seconds.

111912,comment,111677,111871,0,0,ardit33,,,"I don't think Django is a great example.  Python it'self is by far superior to Ruby.  It is one of those kind of languages, where frameworks are optional.  something like web.py or cherrypy are just enough.<p>The problem with python, is that there is plethora of frameworks, but not one is close to perfect.  So, sometimes you don't know what too choose.<p>While with Ruby, you are stuck with one main framework  (well, there are few less popular ones),  which creates more synergy and knowledge towards that framework/way of web developing, but limits choice.",1202458752

111909,comment,111677,111866,0,0,ardit33,,,"ditto cherrypy,  django's api is just not elegant.  Tries to do everything for you, but not exactly like you want to.  It is fine for some kind of apps (the auto autoadmin feature is nice for small or mid apps), but for large apps i'd say start with something that you have total control on what's going on with no magic.  While for small apps, Django might be an overkill.
And turbogears, is just...  how to say, too much.  Pylons is alright thou.",1202458450

I'm not sure I'd say that postgres covers 95% of use cases, as it really only covers single master. That is probably the most common case, but I'd have a hard time putting numbers on it. Extra features cut both ways, some apps are better with postgres, some with MySql.<p>Postgres was 'late' to the replication party, and only in this last release have they had hot slave machines. (with core functionality, 3rd party has a range of alternatives). Currently, it is single master, multi slave replication. Previously, it was been a warm spare arrangement, up to 1 WAL log behind, for durability, and not for load balancing. There were ways of making it less laggy, but it was not trivial to restore a log, bring the db up, and then be in a position to restore another log.",1290113869

You can't apply a standard measurement from a medical x-ray machine that targets a small part of your body using one technique to a different machine that targets your entire body using a different technique.<p>So the two problems are:<p>1. You don't have good numbers to even evaluate how dangerous they are, many evaluations, including possibly the article above, are useless because they don't have the real data to compare to.<p>2. The radiation exposure from a banana also effects your body differently than a medical x-ray machine which is in turn different from a backscatter machine targeting your entire body.<p>I'm not saying people aren't trying to evaluate the actual risk in good faith.  I'm saying they're skipping the step where we get useful numbers from the manufacturer of the machine to even apply good science to.<p>Edit: by ""whole body"" I mean ""whole surface of your body"" since it's concentrated on your skin",1290113450

Pain is a very subjective sensation, and severe pain can cause you to close up and recoil from or fear that sensation.  But it can also be an opportunity for you to face the pain and feel it and all that in implies; it can bring up past suffering or traumatic incidences that bother you and in that context provide the opportunity to heal and move on.<p>Suffering in many ways is getting closer to death, and death provides the opportunity to be begin anew.  It's an abstract concept but can be applied to everything you encounter as a living being.<p>In fact when you try to avoid suffering you close yourself off from so much experience. You could even say that to avoid suffering requires to live as a small subset of yourself, within a very confined sense of self.  Expanding out from that will entail suffering but that's only a very small part of the story and it will lead to experiences you can't yet imagine.",1290113325

Sometimes you're A-OK if you can survive the initial dose. Other doses are accumulative. It depends on the energy of the radiation, the tissue's scattering cross-section, the time, and the flux, among other things.<p>This means that the Sievert (a unit of biological impact due to radiation) is only meaningful in the context of the dose geometry. It's great for talking about a chest X-ray, where the dose is spread out over a big volume of tissue. Where it's unclear is in the case of rapidly-thermalizing or compton-scattered particles: like backscatter. Look at the graph in that article. Something like half of the energy is deposited in the first couple centimeters of tissue.<p>We haven't done this before, and don't have a good model for the long-term effects. My guess? This kind of exposure is a hell of a lot worse for melanomas than a chest X-ray delivering the same energy. Claiming compliance to a metric like the ANSI limits is meaningless.<p>Edit: Oh, and the concern raised over the beam stopping and delivering a couple Sv to a quarter-sized patch of skin is definitely scary. We did exactly that to several people with medical cyclotrons.<p>Edit: I should also mention that tissues have varying tolerance to radiation. Rapidly-dividing cells tend to be hit the hardest, which is why your stomach lining, skin, and hair slough off after acute ionizing rad exposure. Your skin, stomach, lungs, breast and thyroid are also the most frequent to undergo cancer in radiation-linked longitudinal studies.

Ruby was compiled without support for some library. Go find, compile and install that library, then recompile Ruby with that feature (after researching how to compile specific libraries into it), and retry installing the gem. OK, on to the next gem, which needs another missing library. How did Ruby even compile if all these necessary libraries weren't there?

I don't think it is as important the shape that family makes, though, and thus far marriage has only lent legitimacy to certain forms of family -- one man, one woman, largely responsible for the welfare of the offspring they produce. I can think of a lot of ways in which this is suboptimal.<p>But marriage having clear, practical value? It seems the practical value you call out in marriage is that it acts as a sort of moralistic glue to hold a marriage together when other means of adhesion -- trust of one another, emotional support, physical attraction, etc -- have fallen by the wayside. If this need to not fail against some societal title bestowed upon a couple is all that is left holding them together, why is this good? How does ""'till death do us part"" help when it is more of a constraint and/or threat than a promise? And if the couple already has a sufficient number of these things gluing them together, why do we need this additional social glue?<p>So I'd like to see what marriage is meant to represent separated from the actual institution, and considered separately. If a couple has what a marriage represents, but lacks the title, I don't see how this is worth distinguishing -- or a union in general for that matter; I think single man/woman couples are more of a historical accident than anything. If a couple has the title of marriage, but has a substantive lack of what a marriage represents, I don't see how the title is going to make either of their lives better. It only makes them feel guilty for not living up to what they labeled themselves as, and I've never seen the benefit in that.<p>I am married, and there are few things that mean less to my and my wife's relationship than that title. It isn't the glue that bonds us, and it would not be the glue that would keep us together if everything else fell apart. But enough other people think it is that we found not being married a <i>huge</i> inconvenience; society in general, and the government in particular, are heavily tilted toward engineering couples into marriage. We'd have been happy remaining unmarried the rest of our lives if everything weren't so constructed to engineer us into wedlock, but we also didn't want to be so financially penalized for not behaving.<p>So we're married, but there are few things that mean less to us; we were married in all practical purposes before we had the title. Getting the title was strictly pragmatic. If this is part of what is tearing marriage apart, so be it; perhaps it would be better if the institutions that stood so much on ceremony faded into insignificance, and we started focusing more on the things those ceremonies are meant to cement.",1290111979

And since everything is strictly line of sight, if you've been overflown by a satellite (spied on), then you've also had an opportunity to track the satellite and now know when the next fly-over / where will be.<p>What the US has the potential ability to real-time track every satellite around the entire world. In fact, we're pretty sure that that capability exists because they've also tracked everything in orbit larger than a screw.<p>While the X-37 has the capability to make some countries nervous, honestly space does have its own (weaker) version of MAD. I mean, if anyone does something stupid, then the rest can ruin it for everyone. I mean, do you think the US would go about laying mines in space when Russia/China probably have (will have) the capability to knock down GPS satellites? I mean, everyone knows where they are, everyone has the capability to insert into the same orbit.<p>The US would be beyond stupid to use the X37 for anything other than recon (spying!), or grabbing it's own satellites/payloads. Anything else would been as dumb as co-locating satellite launch sites with ICBM silos.<p>Also, despite the lack of public information given out by the Air Force and government, it's entirely likely that the Chinese and Russians know a lot more about the hardware and its capabilities than Wired and the public. Spy agencies exist for a reason. Even amongst 'friends'.",1290111405

For example, it is statement based by default, so any statement which includes a call to NOW() will return different results on master and slave.  PostgreSQL also has failure modes, but the defaults are designed to minimize them -- e.g. it always uses WAL and data file rewrites to ensure that data is properly synced and consistent.<p>3] Due to points 1 & 2, if you aren't an expert and don't need the extra features offered by MySQL, you are probably better off with PostgreSQL.<p>4] 3rd party tools exist for both servers which close many of the feature gaps between them.<p>Could someone who is more knowledgeable than me tell me if this is a fair reading?",1290110544

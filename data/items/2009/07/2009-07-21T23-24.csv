I have always felt that this old meme about talking to yourself being a sign of mental illness was completely ridiculous.<p>Perhaps taken to the extreme, where a person walks around all day spouting nonsensical gibberish to no one in particular may well be a sign of mental illness, but this is very different to what most people seem to be referring to when they think of talking to one's self, and obviously different to what you seem to be referring to, as your question revolves around the idea that people's use of Twitter is potentially just them talking to themselves and why this does not indicate mental illness.<p>I'm sure there are some out there who do just type nonsensical crap into Twitter all day. It certainly seems to me that a great deal of the content that appears on Twitter is inane in the extreme. But none of this supports the underlying assumption of the meme, which seems to be that talking to one's self in any capacity is straying into the realm of mental illness.<p>There is a large difference between the symptoms of mental disorder and having an introspective conversation with yourself, some or all of which may be spoken out in an audible manner.",1248220544

717056,comment,716110,716847,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I saw advertisements for the new 2010 vehicles in January of 2009. The company either lost a 2009 sale from me, or made me not care about the 2010 vehicle <i>at all</i> because it's old news long before it's out.<p>For some products a slow trickle of information helps, however it's generally the exception than the rule (I'd say the movie industry is wholly an exception to this). Windows 7 is faltering because it's the alternative to Vista and now the bad scuff marks of Vista are appearing on 7, instead they could have had 7 appear suddenly and have sold millions of copies before anyone even heard a bad word.<p>Apple has major flaws sometimes, the iPod Nano was a flat out disaster in Europe, but it turned into a disaster <i>after</i> they'd sold millions of copies and not before they'd sold a single copy. If test versions of the Nano had broken <i>en masse</i> even the hardcore Apple fans wouldn't have touched it.<p>Apple thinks it works the other way around is because <i>it does</i> work the other way around. Announcing a product early can set it up for failure, especially today when products can go from concept to market in less than six months. If I announced in Q2 2008 that I had a product coming out at the start of Q4 2009, it gives nearly 18 months to challenge me. It doesn't help that there's a nasty habit of identical products coming out at the same time and if you announce a unique feature early, you're identical by release.",1248219539

717045,comment,716658,716754,0,0,azanar,,,"The difference between one perspective of reality and another is quite striking as well. That is all any of us have to offer: perspective. Past that, reality is largely how you handle the situations presented before you, and a person will react and determine their outcome in some part based on how they interpret their situation.<p>You believe that a layoff could ruin someone's life for years to come. This sounds severely melodramatic even if my hearing it is quite common. If this is your perspective on what would happen if you were laid off at some point, you are probably right. If you believe that you will lose your house, force your kids into a lifestyle of poverty and guarantee no post-secondary education for them, you are probably right again. You are probably right because you will probably <i>make</i> yourself right; either that, or you will count yourself one of the lucky few to survive.<p>On the other hand, you might find an even better job than the one you had; you may have not even been looking before you were laid-off, and didn't know -- or didn't care that -- you had any other options. A company might find an even better use for your's talents, thus guaranteeing that said talent is <i>not</i> lost forever.<p>Self-fulfilling prophecies are quite powerful things; they fundamentally change a person's behavior. I don't think a layoff has to be the end of the road. Even if one has a mortgage and kids, it is how you <i>handle</i> these challenges that determines whether or not it was good for you or the industry. You can either grow and learn, or lament and wallow in self-desperation and resignation.<p>And I have to take on this point about it being no fault of their own in particular, because it has always seemed false to me. If they are put in the position you describe, of being unable to feed their family or keep their home, it is most certainly their responsibility in part. They were not owed that job, and that they lost it is not tragedy. They were not <i>owed</i> anything; they already had little security, as much as they may have convinced themselves of the contrary. That they were in a position to get completely screwed as soon as that job vanished and before they could find another one, that is a tragedy. But it is a tragedy of their own making. They were relying <i>far</i> too much on the security they had supposedly accrued, and too little on keeping themselves in a position to survive misfortune. And I have <i>yet</i> to know someone who is talented being unable to find a job for so long that even with financial preparation they end up broke. Maybe I just know the wrong people, and reality, in an absolute sense, does suck as bad as you go on about.<p>But I think this is way too sensationalist and melodramatic, and I suspect for that reason my grip on the real reality will be called into question.<p>As a random aside, I've heard tales on here a few times of people with mortgages and/or children starting companies of their own, taking on a similar amount of potential pain as someone who is laid off (probably more, because there's no UI payments in the mean time). I'm interested in the perspective of these people on this, because if being laid off is the reading of one's eulogy, it sounds like that doing a startup under similar circumstances is like running oneself through with a knife.",1248218874

717042,comment,716110,716828,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, the work ethic of Silicon Valley is definitely not representative of ""the American way"". Work ethic can vary vastly between states/provinces, cities and even companies. The work ethic I grew up with in the north of England is rather different than the one here in the Greater Toronto Area. However the work ethic of my wives family again is completely different, they come from the east coast where the work is either fishing or farming.<p>I can work like a dog from 9-5, once it's quitting time I'm done. I don't need lunch or breaks, that's how I was taught to work. I can't even approach office culture because from my point of view everyone is a slackass doing nothing because there's always some people who appear not to be working.<p>Perhaps my view of working is similar to those of the Chinese where the industry grew out of manual labour. In fact this so called ""Chinese way"" is indicative of Japan and South Korea (as mentioned elsewhere), where all of the money grew out of steel and ships. When you deal with extreme hazards like red-hot steel (the process of building ships included a lot of manually placed red-hot rivets, and in China still does) so I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of the CEO's and directors grew up from these industries and inherited the work ethic. In the west we turned to the service industries quite early, we're not agricultural or industry any more, so the 100% focus needed for work has likely diminished too.<p>One thing I was taught early, '<i>Never</i> assume, just find out and then you'll know.' This advice has served me well from measuring cuts with materials to dealing with people. It's very ignorant to assume when it's simple to find out. Assumptions can easily kill and I've been witness to that; I saw a guy shot across the room because he assumed the power was turned off when we were working, finding out was merely asking a sentence (to us or his boss who was a foot away) but he didn't and he ended up in hospital (it wasn't negligence on our part, his boss asked us to turn a circuit on so they could run their power tools and the kid decided to run a jump off the live line at the same time).",1248218815

Though ironically enough mainland China is probably the least Confucian of the bunch as a result of Communism.<p>I've read a lot about mainland Chinese office workers quitting Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Singaporean companies because of the ""attitudes"" and the office culture their superiors impose on them.<p>Foxconn is a Taiwanese company, so I'd expect some extra formalities involved in the offices.  Interestingly enough, since the mainland companies are eager to emulate foreign corporate cultures, a good portions of them are adopting the formalities from its Asian neighbors.  Though to balance things out many companies are also going for the more casual tones of western firms.  It'd be interesting to see how it'll work out.<p>Assembly line workers are a different story.  They are pretty much all treated like crap,  since they are considered a lower social class because of their rural births and the lack of legal permits (and thus forfeiting many rights) to live in the cities.  This is the major source of social unrest in China, it's mostly unreported in the west, and it's a much greater threat to the government than all the ethnic conflicts you hear in the media.",1248217823

Random thoughts about anything that interests me; rants, arguments, (rarely) mini-essays on anything in a long list of my interests. Very eclectic.<p>It's extremely popular, with readership in five figures, and typically more than a hundred daily comments on various posts. One of the best things about it is that it has many readers who are smarter than me, and/or more knowledgeable than me on just about any given topic I'm interested in. I've made a few really good friends and a lot of friendly acquaintances through the blog, all over the world.<p>Maybe my case is a rare exception; that wouldn't surprise me. I've tried, for example, to write the same kind of eclectic random-thoughts blog in English -- my primary blog is in Russian -- for a few years, and never got more than 100-200 readers. Maybe I wasn't giving it enough attention (it's semi-dormant now, though I'm trying to find tuits to revive it), or maybe in English, a non-specialized blog has a harder time attracting attention. Or maybe much of it is random. Among the blogs I read (40+ in English, a few hundreds in Russian), most widely-read ones are either by famous people or specialized to some topic; but there are some exceptions like me.",1248217595

One can see this nicely if you simply think of pain as light, the pain sensors as light sensors and the brain as a microprocessor, connected to the sensors. Certainly, if light is there, then the sensors will sense light, and thus, the two statements are equal in this case. 
However, if the sensor only senses light, one strictly does not know if there is light or not, as the sensor might malfunction.<p>If one realizes this distinction between the existance of a state and the recognition of a state, things grow much clearer and one does realize that whatever is going on, one must consider a malfunction of the brain and nerves.",1248217278

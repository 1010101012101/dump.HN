I carry it to work or out of town, but nowhere else.  If I visit someone else, run an errand, or go out to eat, you'll have to leave me a voicemail.  Sorry about that, but I devote my full attention to the people I'm with.<p>I have a laptop, but it leaves my desk once or twice a year.  If I'm on the road, I probably have a file folder full of papers and a thumb drive, but no electronics.<p>I check email many times per day and I visit hn many times per day, but only when I'm already at a computer.  I never IM, Facebook, Twitter, or text.  If you want to communicate with me: if it's important, call me, if not, email me.  Either way, I'll get to it when it's convenient for me, and I'll respond fairly quickly.<p>I went out to dinner with a group including my 22 year old niece.  She texted the entire time (under the table, but we all noticed).  How sad, I thought.  What was so important that she ignored the rest of us for an hour?<p>I almost feel sorry for you, Aaron, but then again, I know better.  I'm curious to see how the next month will affect your lifestyle afterwards.  Hopefully, I'll be able to welcome you back to the real human race (by email, of course.)",1242669586

615354,comment,615197,615197,0,0,joshu,,,"When I think about social software (which is the context in which ""virality"" lives, anyway) I think you have to build for three things - in this order:<p>1. Utility - it must be high utility, even if nobody else is in the system.<p>2. Network Effect - As people are drawn into the system, it needs to scale in value more than linearly<p>3. Residual value - Value taken out of the system, sometimes as revenue. Typically ads.<p>I think that it's not good enough to do these alone, however. You must construct something that isn't just viral but that makes it such that the fact that some person is not on the system is PAINFULLY ANNOYING to the actual users of the system. Consider the growth of email, in general: ""Please just go sign up for an email address somewhere so I can email you!""<p>If you construct it in this manner, you do not have to spam people. Delicious, which has a lot of users, never emailed anything other than password resets, for example.",1242669274

615344,comment,615197,615206,0,0,blhack,,,"One thing to remember is who your target is.<p>Lets look at an example that I had to deal with about a week ago:  The company I work for is having a pretty large event coming up, something that our customers would most likely be very interested in.  My boss's reaction was that we should grab the email addresses that we have harvested from our website (signups require an email address), and send those people an email telling them about the event.<p>I'm sure that the majority of you can predict what my reaction to this was...something along the lines of ""No, that is spam, that is bad, part of my job is preventing exactly the type of email you want to send out from making it onto our network.  By harvesting email addresses from our website you are violating our customers trust; spam spam spam, BAD!""  Naturally, the PHBs did not understand this and, despite my best efforts to stop them, they ended up sending the spam (although I forced them to use a different mail server than we use for sending mails).<p>After much anger, and much thinking, I have come to a conclusion about this.  I have changed my mind.  Now...I, as a geek/admin, DESPISE the sorts of mass mailings that they sent out, but why?  I hate them because I hear ""mass mail"" and immediately think ""0mG G3t V14GRA N0W!"", something that I hate.  I know the sorts of slimey tactics that spammers use to evade spam filters, and actively fight against them.<p>The ""problem"" is that the majority of my dislike for ""mass mailings"" are technical.  I hate them because they are not what the email system was intended for, and because they are a pain in my ass.  You know what, though, they're things that most of our customers <i>want</i> to hear.  Looking through my email box, I see that there are some things (mailing lists, google's newsgroup summary emails that come every day telling me what happened in comp.sys.ibm.as400.misc that day, emails from a website called steapandcheap [like woot, but for outdoor gear], backup confirmation emails etc.) that are automated, and might seem evil at first (the commercial stuff like steapandcheap especially) but are actually things that I WANT to see.<p>Where am I going with all of this?<p>There is a good chance that your hatred for the sorts of tactics he describes here come from your nature as a geek.  The unfortunate reality is that the majority of users just simply don't care.  Look at things like myspace, look at success stories like that 15 year old girl that is making 7 figures with her website that does myspace layouts (err..I think she is like 19 now...she was talked about in the 30 woman web entrepreneurs making big $$ article the other day), look at facebook applications like honesty box, these things are HORRIFYINGLY bad from the perspective of a geek.  But to a normal person, to the type of person that is keeping the ""Click here for a FREE iPoD!"" advertisers in business, and to the type of person you're probably trying to attract, these things that we might find ""obnoxious"", they find useful.<p>It is a sad reality, but it is a reality nonetheless.",1242668919

I still don't understand how a train ride away the same lifestyle would cost 50USD a day. Why?<p>A lot of the numbers people use to describe how people live are misleading. In poorer countries, organizational structures are flatter.  You pay the owner of the chicken for the eggs.  This leaves out the money for the factory workers, the truckers, the marketing, the grocery store (and all its hierarchies), and profits for the shareholders who perform no labor at all.  This is monetary waste.  This waste increases prices for the consumer.<p>This is true in a lot of countries outside the u.s. The food in the restaurant is cooked by the owner of the restaurant, not a wage earner.  The efficiencies found by automation and commoditization of labor are lost in the waste of trickle down economics.<p>Another aspect of life in poorer areas of the world - including many areas of the united states - is the barter that occurs between many individuals.  I'll mow your lawn if you paint my house.  I have the mower, you have the ladder and the brushes.<p>This type of cooperation is lost in an individualistic society like the united states where everyone performs a role.  The cashier, the delivery person, the accountant.  In ""poorer"" societies, these roles are performed by a single person in many cases.<p>This division of labor has, rather than increased productivity and decreased cost, in fact increased cost due to monetary waste at each exchange.  Listen to Noam Chomsky describe the ""real Adam Smith"" and how he believes the division of labor will destroy the individual through wage slavery.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugq86q9KyPE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugq86q9KyPE</a>  I have not read ""wealth of nations"" myself, to verify Chomsky's opinion of Smith's work, but I have it on hold at the library and will soon.<p>Think of it like physics.

They too are resilient and in fact have a lot of traits that entrepreneurs have except for the value system, a socially acceptable behavior & positive contribution.<p>A very small percentage of dysfunctional families would generate great entrepreneurs and I would like to believe that this is just a correlation. One is probably better off to grow in proper functional and stable families but with good exposure/support to possess necessary traits.<p>Edit: Additionally an unstable or dysfunctionally childhood even among those small percentage might have caused them to have extreme bahaviours on rudeness, temper, patience, trust etc. which is very adverse for startups.",1242667361

The implementation of the viplugin.com emulation layer isn't nearly as good as actual vim, but the eclipse integration more than makes up for it.<p>On that note, if you prefer netbeans to eclipse, the jvi plugin for netbeans is much better than the eclipse vi plugin and I very rarely miss a vim feature when using it, and it's completely free as well.

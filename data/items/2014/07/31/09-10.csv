Or, they may have a different problem with too much fragmentation and lack of coherence.<p>What we need is a system that is both holistic and coherent but also componentized and diverse.<p>There is quite a lot of techno-communist thinking going around that fails to recognize this problem of over-centralization which has numerous times in the past shown how dangerous and repressive it can be.  A hierarchical system, like a tree, has vulnerabilities and entrenchment in each root or branch.<p>The last time I said something like this, a Marxist just told me I was asking for two contradictory things that was impossible, and implied that the answer was Marxism.<p>How can we have a system that is well-organized, with different parts that are aware of eachother and the big picture without a lot of redundancy and waste or counter-productivity, but at the same time is set up in a way that makes it free to experiment and form new directions and even refactor old ones?<p>I think that is actually a very hard problem, but one that can be solved.

Some people need to remember the purpose for which PHP was started and what it still is great at: making websites.<p>You guys are stuck in high brow academic debate on the semantic of a language that was born before many of us started coding, and that helped the web become what it is today. And that has come a long way.<p>I&#x27;m not saying to stop improving the language, but as someone who has used PHP for 15 years, all the issues I see come up constantly in threads like this are non issues, never encountered them in any web situation, you have to seek these &quot;bugs&quot;/annoyance, or be seriously inexperienced with PHP, or as I&#x27;ve been saying for years any time I do conferences: you are using PHP wrong.<p>So please, keep your verbose syntax in other languages that &quot;need&quot; it, while there are improvement to be made on PHP, this is not an area that needs one.<p>Also, looking at your bug submission/request, I share krakjoe sentiment: what the F are you trying to achieve?

Eventually we caved and had to pay the extra expense of renting a car through a car sharing site.<p>San Francisco was really not much better - to get there, the only viable option was either to drive or to take the CalTrain - always extraordinarily crowded in the busiest hours, not to mention slow and with long waits in between trains. Getting around in the city on foot also presented an ordeal, but at least MUNI and BART helped somewhat.<p>This added a huge expense for our company that would have been completely unnecessary in other cities - including the rental price and fuel, the car ended up burning about $800/mo on its own. Not to mention the amount of time wasted driving around to get basic things done like visiting the bank or the supermarket.<p>It became clear to me why companies like Uber were making a killing in the U.S - public infrastructure was so badly supported that there is just no way to live without access to a vehicle.

From what my parents (both GPs) told me, in the Netherlands we used to have a lot of volunteers helping out family members who needed extra support, and who simply got a fixed amount of extra money per month, no hassle. This had the extra benefit that it let nurses and doctors focus on the more difficult problems that they specifically were trained for.<p>Then the government decided things had to be more fair (we&#x27;re talking early eighties), so people suddenly had to fill in forms defining exactly how many hours they spent on helping out family to get the amount of money they deserve. Or something like that. The point was that there was this new layer of bureaucratic administration. It was a disaster, and within a few years they rolled it back. By then however, a lot of volunteers had simply given up and stopped helping, and they did not come back. And in the last decade we made the same mistake all over again.<p>What&#x27;s especially important to note was that under the new rules, <i>people on average would have been paid more for their help</i> - the old compensation was not nearly enough to cover the time and costs of the volunteers. And yet we ended up with less volunteers.<p>Almost all of the examples you mentioned are things people do <i>for other reasons than the money</i>; any monetary compensation should be more of a hassle-free symbolic gesture of appreciation, or it ruins the whole intrinsic motivation.

But in terms of language usability and consistency, PHP is still miles behind pretty much everything else, especially given the slow deployment of new versions of PHP. As for &quot;unfounded criticism&quot;... some particular inconsistencies have been fixed, but the original criticisms are still valid - they just apply to different things now.<p>If you look into the way the PHP interpreter actually works internally, you&#x27;d rapidly find that suggestions like &quot;methods one can call on the objects themselves&quot; is more or less an impossibility. As far as I&#x27;m aware, rather than treating base types as special kinds of objects, PHP seems to treat them as entirely differerent types, which leads to something like &quot;calling a method on it&quot; being a technical impossibility in the current architecture.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely not an expert on the internals of PHP - but from the design flaws that leak through at times, it becomes obvious that the PHP internals consist of a lot of hard-to-maintain code bloat, and that code reuse/abstraction is not as common as it should be.

I&#x27;ve give up in living in Madrid because I can´t stand the fact that anything you do needs a 30 min by car or subway minimum. I&#x27;ve also lived in Barcelona and other small cities like Salamanca that would be a better example of a walking city.<p>I have chosen to commute a 1 hour plane to work (I work in 3-4 days spans and then several days off, so it´s doable) because I rather go walking everywhere, or if I have to take a car, it only takes 3 min to get there.<p>- More dense cities are more pleasant to live.\n- More slow paced live.\n- You meet people you know all the time (you don´t stop to talk to unknown people usually), which is nice and necessary. We are social animals after all.\n- You usually end knowing most neighbor businesses owners and clerks, also you also get to know other neighbors around your street.\n- It´s very productive, you can get most stuff done in 15 min tops.<p>But to do it from scratch there are certain parts that you mention that must be taken in to account.<p>- You need green parks than old medieval cities, they must be a central part of the planning. They give air, and the much needed green surroundings we need. They also help giving more luminosity to the city. Old cities were that tight because they needed to be inside walls for protection, that´s not the case any more, and density it´s not such a priority anymore.\n- You MUST limit the size of the city. Above 200k and 300k residents, it starts growing too much and expanding to levels where you need mayor infrastructure to handle the volume of people getting to popular locations. The effect of a small city is lost (or at least you start loosing it). It would be better to build a group or constellation, of small cities connected by train, and surrounded by parks and industrial zones.\n- Parking is a mayor problem, you can deal with it, if you plan for big parkings outside the city and good public transport, and mandatory parking below the buildings (if you are starting from scratch, in Barcelona is impossible). Also if it´s well planed a lot of people don´t need to own a car.\n-Sunlight is a problem for row housing, but if they are well designed and oriented ( for example if you have a narrow street at the front, you get a big patio), with interior patios and attics, you can get a very nice urban landscape (with terrace gardens included) for the upper floors, and the patio to the lower ones. Patios are a central part of some urban Mediterranean cities, most live was lived facing to them. \n-Bikes are better channeled to more central and wide streets, and only allowed to go to the narrow ones to get to the destination (going slow at that parts). This is something that small cities like Ferrara (Italy) have pretty much nailed, but others like Palma de Mallorca are slowly iterating to solve.<p>Living in a small city makes you change the way you live, it´s a different mentality, sometimes people from Madrid or Barcelona get shocked by the change and can&#x27;t handle it. Their usual complains are:<p>-I can&#x27;t get all the options I got on my big city (theaters, museums, events, parties, etc..). Well this is true, but the fact is that when asked this people usually don´t go out of their neighborhoods, and rarely go to the theater or museums. You can have the same rate of Museum visits, going as a tourist once a year.\n-People is more nosy and opinionated about your live. Well this is true, and can be difficult to adapt for  city or suburb people. But I´ve noticed that most internet social apps are designed to replicate this nosy live. We are social beings, and when you live isolated in a suburb home, you still need to be in contact with people.<p>At the end it´s very very pleasant to go to buy bread and start talking with one neighbor or a friend for 10 min (if you want of course, you can always go your way saying hello). Even now a day it´s much individualistic than it used to be. My grandmother used to tell me how they all knew each other, not only in their street, but in their neighborhood. This happened when everybody had problems to get food or money, and people had to help and get help in a daily basis.<p>We need people around and small cities give a nice compromise between the small tribe that we evolved in and the big community where everything it´s possible. Every time I read comments at HN about social Apps(to get new contacts) or being a loner, or an introvert, I see that those are problems that are seem to be much smaller here in southern Europe. Here hardcore introverts still exist, but they seem to be more scarce, and people use social apps a lot, but they still see each other in a weekly or daily basis (that is, when living in the same city). Dating apps are used, but you still can go out, and meet people you know that will introduce you to new people.",1406797758

8113123,comment,8110144,8111711,3,0,chriswarbo,,,"It&#x27;s not legit to error-out for eval, since PHP has all kinds of eval-like things.<p>For example, PHP has two namespaces for functions: anonymous functions live in the regular variable namespace, so they can be passed around directly. Named (AKA global) functions are completely separate, so we can&#x27;t pass them around as values. For example:<p><pre><code>    $my_anon = function() {};\n\n    function my_named() {}\n\n    // Valid\n    array_map($my_anon, []);\n\n    // Invalid\n    array_map(my_named, []);\n</code></pre>\nAs a workaround, whenever PHP sees a string when it&#x27;s expecting a function, it will try to find a global function with a name matching the contents of the string. In other words, we can do:<p><pre><code>    // Valid\n    array_map(&#x27;my_named&#x27;, []);\n</code></pre>\nThis is basically a weak form of eval: taking a string of PHP code (&#x27;my_named&#x27;) and getting back the value it evaluates to (the my_named function). If you error-out for eval, you have to error-out for this, since the content of strings is runtime information and there&#x27;s no way you can infer it well enough. For example:<p><pre><code>    function smart_replace() {\n      $args = func_get_args();\n      $func = array_shift($args)? &#x27;str&#x27; : &#x27;preg&#x27;;\n      return call_user_func_array(&quot;{$func}_replace&quot;, $args);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOther eval-like things in PHP include variable property lookups, variable method calls and &quot;variable variables&quot;:<p><pre><code>    $foo = &quot;hello&quot;;\n\n    $object1->$foo = $object2->$foo;  // Sets $object1&#x27;s &quot;hello&quot; property to $object2&#x27;s\n\n    $object3->$foo();  // Calls $object3&#x27;s &quot;hello&quot; method\n\n    $bar = &quot;foo&quot;;\n    echo $$bar;  // Outputs hello\n</code></pre>\nOne interesting fact about these features is that, since they&#x27;re not as powerful as a real eval, it can often be perfectly safe to supply them with unvalidated user input:<p><pre><code>    array_map(&#x27;str_&#x27; . $_GET[&#x27;string_function&#x27;], $my_array);\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s no way we can swap out things like this reliably, and remember that these are not just &quot;crazy uses of eval&quot;, they&#x27;re <i>officially sanctioned</i> ways of working, which in some cases (eg. function names in strings) have <i>no</i> alternatives (short of redefining your own standard library).",1406797529

We&#x27;ve only moved in two months ago so we haven&#x27;t experienced a winter yet but even in the current summer climate it has already been an order of magnitude more comfortable than any of the other places I&#x27;ve lived in. When the temperature hit 30 degrees Celsius for a couple of days last week the house was at a comfortable 23 degrees. Everywhere.<p>Key design points:<p>- Insulation, insulation, insulation. We have 30cm cellulose in the walls and 36cm in the roof plus some 5cm fiberglass in the space between the walls and drywall.<p>- Airtightness, in combination with a ventilation system (with heat recovery).<p>- Large windows (triple glazing) on east, south and west sides to get free heat from the sun in the winter but have some screens to keep the sun out in the summer.<p>- We use a geothermal heat pump to prepare hot water and to be able to heat the house a little bit in the winter when needed, using underfloor heating pipes. Extra bonus that has turned out to be essential: we can use this system to passively cool the house by simply pumping the water through the pipes and into the ground. This can lower the temperature in the house by several degrees in an energy efficient way.<p>Based on our energy consumption for the two months we&#x27;ve lived here we&#x27;ll end up at around 3500-4000kWh per year. And that includes everything: heat pump, ventilation, all electrical appliances, ...<p>Building such a house isn&#x27;t rocket science. The materials and techniques are well known and readily available (at least here); it&#x27;s mostly a matter of good planning upfront and paying attention to the details when executing. Not all construction companies are up to speed but they&#x27;re slowly getting there (or they&#x27;ll disappear).<p>As a matter of fact: the EU has mandated that by 2020 every newly built house must be more or less equivalent to a passive house.",1406797439

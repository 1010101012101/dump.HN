269586,comment,269212,269494,0,0,time_management,,,"True, but what makes a creature like the gordian worm more interesting is that there's a reproductive benefit, for the parasite, inherent to the behavioral changes induced. Do the pork tapeworms benefit by causing this problem in humans, or is it just an incidental side effect? It seems to me to be the latter.",1218113740

In this respect, my past experience has not been good (no response to emails/queries/etc), but maybe that is because I am not significant to them as an individual.<p>When I compare this to the engaging experiences I find with many YC start-ups (<a href=""http://www.socialbrowse.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socialbrowse.com</a> springs to mind) and others (e.g. <a href=""http://www.huddle.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huddle.net</a> and <a href=""http://www.freshbooks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freshbooks.com</a>), the difference is night and day.<p>Maybe this is just my experience.

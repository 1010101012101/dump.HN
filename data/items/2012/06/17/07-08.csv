Instead I am going to talk about the conclusions the article makes.<p>""Because reproductive success is the ultimate goal of all living organisms, so intelligent women are more likely to go against such evolutionary design.""<p>If were going to go ahead and define the most important things in life as the most evolutionarily viable ones, then we've already ceded <i>way</i> too much ground. And even this argument doesn't take into account things like overpopulation, if everyone tried to maximize baby output, we'd fill the planet up mighty quick. So it may actually make sense to reproduce <i>less</i>, but not necessarily not at all.<p>""My theory would also predict that intelligent men should be less likely to become parents, but data do not confirm that. Some suggest that women prefer to have children with more intelligent men, but the data contradict this too.""<p>If the data already contradicts your hypothesis, then why say it?<p>""Mens income or education has no effect on their likelihood of becoming parents. Intelligence doesnt allow us to do better what we are designed by evolution to do.""<p>Designed is a misnomer, natural selection works because those who survive are the ones represented. We weren't ""designed"" to do anything. Were here because the people before us had babies. It is preferable that we continue to have babies so that people will exist in the future, but raw baby making isn't everything. Our ""Evolutionarily novel"" environment was made through the use of intelligence. On a societal level intelligence is important to create novel inventions which keep more humans alive long enough to make babies. If intelligent people don't reproduce, but the populations that they spawn in stay alive longer than dumber populations, then the people who have recessive intelligence genes that let them occasionally spawn a genius will do just fine, leaving intelligent people in the system and making them evolutionarily valuable.<p>Of course, on a individual scale this may not work out too well for the intelligent people.<p>With all that in mind, in the spirit of Fermi's Paradox: <i>If intelligence isn't evolutionarily valuable, and is in fact negatively correlated with evolutionary success, then why are the smart people still here?</i> (In non-trivial numbers.)",1339918984

Do I do a lot of PHP today? Nope, occasional hacks and quickies, that's it. But from there I went to actionscript, javascript, C#, Flex / WPF / Silverlight... Touched C, C++, Haskell, Python, Go... Heck I even have some Haxe on my computer.<p>Whatever you have in hand, pick it up and do stuff. Pick a language that you can run easily, debug easily, and that is mature in the sense that whatever you google for, you will find. Try and pick a project that you are passionate for and open a github repo and give it your best shot. Try and implement the same thing in different languages if you think it's fun, or try tackle large problems with simple solutions that may only work 60% of the time.<p>Who cares, just do stuff that you can then show. Get an internship anywhere, stick in for a year or two. Then move on to the next place. Surround yourself of smart developers. Seek them and see how they think. Not wankers, genuinely good people. Not only they know their job, but they will love passing on knowledge. Ask them to review your stuff, bounce ideas, dumb questions, everything. That's far better than books IMO.<p>One thing is for sure, I don't learn much from books. Books help when you have a very gritty issue you feel totally helpless against.

Just because intelligent people are good at adapting to evolutionarily novel things does not mean they prefer to do those things.<p>Where does the preference come from? According to Kanazawa, because of paranoia. Humans appear to be designed to be paranoid; they are designed to see intentional agents behind natural phenomena.<p>""This is because making the mistake of thinking that a natural event has an intentional agent behind it is less potentially costly than being oblivious and thinking that an intentional event, like someone trying to kill you, has a coincidental cause.

It's also legitimate for prgmr.sux or whatever (assuming that top level domain is created) to be owned by someone that wants to say bad things about me.

You don't need to be close enough to hear their voices, since body language will be your important leader. If you can hear them speak, even better. You can also make it into a social outing by bringing along a friend and making running commentary on the date (this will help you exchange notes and speed the learning process, and it will also make learning fun and thus increase retention). Note that these things (esp #2) are both fairly socially unacceptable, so be aware of that and try to be somewhat discreet.<p>Once you do that, go out and use the body language you've learned to indicate flirting and assess other's reactions. Test, adjust, repeat. The hardest part is that you'll need to find a group of people whose opinion you don't care about until you're vaguely OK at it.

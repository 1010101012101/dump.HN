4557850,comment,4556838,4557547,4,0,shimon,,,"Minecraft maybe didn't set out to be a startup, but it achieved all the growth goals of one, and it's certainly fair to call it one now, isn't it?<p>Games like Diablo and BG are actually run in a fashion closer to movies than startups. A game publisher finances games that it expects will succeed. The publisher's competitive advantage comes largely from brand equity and high capital cost of creating a new game. Thanks to brand equity, they are primarily expanding or upselling into a market where they already have a lot of reach. Of course, there is some risk of failure in each project, but it's closer to that of making a blockbuster sequel than that of solving a novel problem with technology.",1348322300

At least in most fields, emotional (and other kinds) conflicts of interest are also prohibited.
Even ignoring him making money off his books, i'm not sure how you can say that, given his very passionate, subjective, argument in favor of one particular point of view in his books, he doesn't have an emotional conflict of interest in seeing his point of view succeed. 
The idea that he can just ""turn it on and off"" so that when he's doing ""science time"" he's magically objective, and when he's doing ""book time"", he's not, would require a bit of straining to believe.<p>This is why, for example, in the legal field, judges are required to avoid the <i>appearance</i> of bias, not just bias.",1348322041

They liked the work they did, but not the work of running a business. Likewise, engineers in full time perm jobs were asking for career advice on a regular basis - not just negotiation, but whether to stay hands on vs manage, whether to get a certification, to take pay cuts for a better tech environment, etc. The answers depend on the candidate's situation, but I became a trusted advisor to many.

The ""random variable"" concept (a function over a sample space with a probability measure) is the stateless analogue that is more usable in abstract reasoning. In probability, we don't care about the specific values the variable actually ends up producing, but <i>all</i> the values it can produce and how likely each is.<p>In the observed world, it's unknown (pre-measurement) and appears to be random. In the mathematical world, it's a function over a sample space.<p>It's a mechanism to reason about randomness by (though the magic of probability) taking the randomness and state out.",1348321305

Below that, there is definitely utility in every dollar as far as Doing What I Like goes - although of course diminishing returns still apply.<p>And for some people - like Elton Musk, whom he mentions - there is effectively no top end in sight.

If the answer is time, you might as well find a decent paying factory job and make widgets all day.<p>The thing is, companies don't want to write software, they want to fix business problems. Writing software is just a path to that. So yes, you may charge more but you also have experience with their business and you've been there, helping them solve their problems (at least I hope you have).<p>It's a hard pill to swallow, but a client that won't consider the quality/history versus cost argument isn't worth having.

4557764,comment,4554669,4555008,3,0,jwwest,,,"This is extremely common. Since I was recently in the same situation as yourself, I thought I'd share what has been working for me and might work for you too.<p>The number one thing you have to understand is that your first few clients will be hard to get. There's no way around this. The good news is that once you start to have a history of successful projects, more and more people will start to come to you. This will happen, trust me.<p>Secondly, unless you're patio11, don't expect to be immune from the normal sales cycle. As engineers, we understand code and servers but not always business side of things. Business moves at its own pace: some companies move extremely quickly, some slower. The key is to manage your pipeline by continuously talking to potential clients and following up with them regularly and often. These companies have their own budgets and timelines to worry about.<p>""1/3 of projects you bid on you will never get, 1/3 you may get, and 1/3 you will always get."" This is a saying that has kept me motivated through rough patches. The important thing is not to get discouraged and quit.<p>You will talk to a ton of people in your work. Don't be discouraged if you talk to 10 people and only 1 shows interest in potentially hiring you. You want to find the right clients, not land every client.<p>Don't work without a contract or MSA and SOW. This looks amateurish and can throw some potential clients off. Clients that don't want to hire you because of this are clients you really don't want.<p>Speaking of the above statement, never estimate ""off the cuff"". Always take the time to provide a thorough estimate with plenty of examples of what the client can expect. This reduces the amount of ""sticker shock"" a client can experience when you quote something off the top of your head. This is true in both email and phone/in-person conversations. I always redirect the conversation to what I can do for the company, rather than what I think something would cost if a client asks:<p>Client: '...so, how much do you think that'll cost?'<p>Me: 'Well, the Foobaz piece is a pretty good chunk of functionality and having that work fast and reliably is really important to keep your XYZ going. I'll also have to do some research on ABC so that we're both clear on exactly how this can help you out. Did you have any ideas on that?'<p>Finally, actionable advice: get out there and hustle. Pick an industry that regularly hires freelancers/consultants (creative agencies are huge in this space) and contact them directly. Email is usually fine, just make sure that you're brief, don't sound like you're mass emailing, and never ever email a bunch of people the same messages (ie send out individual emails). I use a combination of Rapportive (helps me guess email addresses for important individuals at a company) and Boomerang (lets me schedule outgoing messages).<p>Never ever email info@company.com or use their 'contact us' email form, always try to find a decision maker at the company to contact. LinkedIn is great for this.<p>Remember that you're not begging for work. You offer solutions to business problems and you're reaching to see if you can form a business relationship with them. Present what you do and how you can help what they're dealing with -right now-.",1348319122

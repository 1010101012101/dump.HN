The social features this guy recommends belong in extensions, and, incidentally, extensions with that functionality already exist.<p>I think the ""social media"" obsession has gone on long enough.

304105,comment,303872,303872,0,0,rplevy,,,"Maybe it's because I live in Massachusetts and not Kansas, but I really deplore the fighting back and forth between armchair (and actual) evolutionary biologists with the anti-science rightwing religious groups.  While I am on the side of science of course, it annoys me how counterproductive the whole fight has become.  The need for evo bio people to fend off ID types in arguments has made the pro-science public less humble, and less accurate too, because we forget how little we actually know about how evolution works, and instead cling to the politically strongest ideas that science generates.  In fact, many fundamental problems that need to be solved are being bullied into the margins by the need to make evolutionary theory seem stronger than it really is.  In the last 10-15 years The MIT Press has put out several good books delving into the cutting edge of evolutionary theory, among other things exploring the role of complexity in evolution.  It may surprise some that ""natural selection"" is not universally agreed on, as there is a competing paradigm in which the production of forms is the driver of change, and selection is hypothesized to be a filter, having more of a conserving than progressive force on organisms.  The problem is that too many scientists outside of biology assume that the neo-Darwinian synthesis popularized by philosophers like Dennett and Dawkins (also fighters in the battle against religion, not coincidentally), is the one and established view, and allow it to shape the interpretation of results in other fields.  Perhaps if we were to ignore the creationists instead of fighting them, then we could acknowledge the primitive state of our models and make some real progress.",1221433033

Condom keychains are funny but hardly revolutionary. It's not going to be a product that sells it self, hires its own consultants & negotiates with Wal Mart while you sip Tequilas. What he did was establish a wholesaling business with only one product, where he had to pay cash & sell on credit.<p>Not knocking the effort, but designing/sourcing/manufacturing apples is not the same as selling apples.

304099,comment,304000,304092,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Huh. The classic tragedy of the commons example I was taught in high school was about lighthouses. In college, I found out that nobody had tested this empirically except Ronald Coase, who found that lighthouses tended to be private and profitable, historically (this, of course, is not taught in standard economics courses; I only found out because I took a course on Coase).<p>And I don't even know about scientific research. I've talked to people at private research groups (e.g. Microsoft Research), and at major universities; the latter spend a lot less time doing research, and a lot more time delegating to grad students or hustling for grants. It is ironic, I guess, that the public servants spend their time in such bourgeoisie pursuits, while the capitalists are busy doing research.",1221432188

When I search for the same terms I used to search for earlier, google always shows me 'likely' results. I.e, if I search for example for 'window handle', a few years ago, this would almost certainly show a bunch of programming results. Nowadays, the search result is very different, and a lot less relevant to what I'm looking for.<p>This is where search has to be fixed. When I type window handle, I want a HWND. When a builder types 'window handle', his first result should be a local store where he can buy window handles or descriptions of window handles.<p>That's where search has to be fixed, not in crawling.",1221430505

And to top it off, they are mixing in virtual dollars (gambling) into the mix, which has been under fire recently in the U.S. <p>Its an untapped market for sure, but a snake-pit in litigation issues. May be the next YouTube you never know, but I doubt it, the sports leagues are more aware of the online world the movie studios.   ",1194461867

77100,comment,77060,77060,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Key insight:<p><i>The secret of Google's success? They let you market anything, no matter how uncool, to anyone who can figure out a PC. We can Google for anything and buy it without anyone knowing. Google for ""dandruff,"" ""hemorrhoids,"" or ""erictile disfunction"" [sic]. Boom, boom, and boom--$4 billion adds up fast. Do you think I'm going to let Facebook use me to hawk Preparation H to fellow writers? Not a chance.</i><p>I hadn't even thought of that. One reason Google is so powerful with its advertising is that it is <i>private</i>. A lot of Internet purchases fall under this banner besides those mentioned above; a big one that comes to mind is gifts. Someone looking to purchase a gift for a friend is not going to do it through Facebook for fear that they might learn about it before receiving it.  They will also be unqualified to review the merit of the item since they are not the ones who own it.<p>Facebook's advertising plan might work. It certainly has to be an improvement over their current methods. Then again, it has the potential to drive away users who are tired of being constantly marketed to. (Is it just me, or does it seem like when I finally do decide to buy something, it's a lot harder to find than when I didn't want it?) I agree, however, that Google certainly has the upper hand here with a model that Facebook can never hope to match, because on Google, many users are actually looking to buy something.",1194461762

77091,comment,77005,77029,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"It does require separation of code, but not twice as much debugging. Every bug does not have to be fixed twice. It's similar to MVC architecture in a way, with the flex client being the view. I'd be surprised if the bug fixing isn't actually easier due to the separation.<p>Also, your goal in a startup is not to make it easy for you to code, but to make it easy for your users to play. (You only do the former where it assists with the latter.) Java does not accomplish that. People don't want to piss with JRE. It is a bloated nightmare that crashes people's systems, nags them about updates, slows down bootup, etc. <p>Everyone has Flash. In fact, more people have flash than javascript (turned on) making it the most commonly accepted environment. It and AJAX are really the only acceptable choices for a live draft.",1194460867

The poster is not informed this has happened, nor told why.<p>There are two enormous disadvantages to this model - it doesn&#x27;t encourage commenters to improve the quality of what they post, and it ultimately creates an atmosphere of mistrust, from those who have been silently black-holed.<p>The Reddit model of public votes is better, even when layered with admin moderation, because at least users can see what is happening, and why.",1423108784

9001629,comment,9001312,9001474,0,0,birdsareweird,,,"I can&#x27;t help but see your comment as a symptom of the problem it&#x27;s describing. Not trolling, but geek bias... specifically the blind spot of assuming everyone is as sincere as you.<p>The big problem with comment sections isn&#x27;t &quot;trolling&quot;, it&#x27;s that most people aren&#x27;t there to have a fair, rational discussion in the first place. They are there to be entertained or distracted, that will be the main motivation of people doing the browsing. They want to see their opinions and choices validated, while uncomfortable and inconvenient facts are hidden or mocked. At minimum they will avoid anything that reflects badly on themselves and where they can&#x27;t shift the blame easily. See for example the latest wave of &quot;criticism = harassment&quot; in news sections and on Twitter, where being called out for saying stupid things in public is frantically derided as &quot;sea lioning&quot; which must be stopped.<p>So trying to fix comment sections behaviorally does not work because they stop being comments. At most you can do something like StackOverflow, which follows a strict Q&A format and bans repetition. It&#x27;s not really a forum, it&#x27;s a wiki of googleable questions, and like Wikipedia, is mostly unappealing and unwelcoming to outsiders with fresh ideas.<p>Besides, the appropriate answer is not to censor and hide, but to confront and refute. You want bad ideas to be catalogued and paired with their antidote, not let people remain blissfully unexposed, their mental immune system ready to overreact to the slightest provocation. The only forums I know of where everyone gets along with everyone are echo chambers. In real discussions somebody&#x27;s toes always get stepped on. Real names do not help there btw, people still make plenty of dumb comments with their face next to it, it only helps the offendees play the victim card.<p>I think your &quot;inevitable descent into trolling&quot; is a bad description of how intellectual forums grow their audience: they become more superficial, more emotionally driven and more focused on presentation than merit. Like TED talks. But if you don&#x27;t grow, you stagnate and turn into an echo chamber. Neither is desirable, you can only try to grow responsibly. You have to allow disruptive voices no matter what.",1423108692

I think that while learning to program has become more <i>accessible</i> thanks to the Web, it has also probably gotten harder do to the exponential increase in complexity of the systems that we program. There is also much more to software development than just programming.<p>In my day (taking the liberty of revisionist exaggeration), one could write cool and useful programs with a simple language and text based i/o. Programming and software development were nearly the same thing, and were exactly the same if you were an amateur like me.<p>Today, languages are necessarily more complex in order to interface with ... enormous systems and libraries of exponentially increasing complexity. At least, that&#x27;s what it seems like from where I sit. And software development goes way beyond programming. Once you learn to program, there&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother stage of learning how to use big code libraries, frameworks, IDE&#x27;s, and so forth. I&#x27;m not sure anybody has figured out how to teach someone else to approach a big code library.<p>Maybe there should be a set of lessons in Code Academy, whose point is to learn how to get stuff done using the documentation and related lore (StackOverflow, etc.) for a complex library like MatPlotLib. I did something similar when I agreed to teach a review session for a math course that I had never taken. I had no choice but to show how to approach a textbook as a resource for solving problems. Maybe my students got more out of that, than they would have from just memorizing formulas.<p>For kids, a way around this problem might be to strip away the complexity by teaching programming on a platform that just doesn&#x27;t have all of that stuff, e.g., Arduino.",1423107283

The problem of the early 1900s began with a bounty of riches in the highly competitive American Railway sector. Merchants using the railways were demanding &quot;rebates&quot; from railway companies for large shipments threatening to take business elsewhere and driving their shipping costs down. Of course, the same leverage was not available to smaller shippers, making their rates much higher and forcing them to raise the prices of their goods. The system was out of balance.<p>In 1903, congress and President Theodore Roosevelt, passed the Elkins Act [2], which eliminated rebates, but had the unfortunate side-effect of increasing price collusion between shippers and the railroads. The Elkins act did not establish a fixed rate, leaving interests to make deals that, again, were disadvantageous for smaller businesses. The only metric of discrimination was the diverting from a fixed railway schedule [3].<p>To correct the problems of the Elkins Act, the Hepburn Act was passed in 1906 greatly expanding the power of the ICC to regulate the Railroad Industry. The result was fixed prices on shipping deemed &quot;just and reasonable&quot; by the ICC, increased penalties for non-compliance, and an open and standard accounting system for the railroad companies. (As an aside, the depreciation of railway companies contributed to the Panic of 1907. A good word on that here: [4])<p>If all this back and forth sounds familiar, it is because we are facing the same problem today shipping bits that we were shipping coal and shirts all those years ago. The idea of prioritized delivery is not new or novel, but was dealt with before Netflix and Verizon began suing one another. What interests me is whether we will see legislation similar to the Elkins and Hepburn act for digital goods and services. I doubt very seriously that we will get fixed $/(Mbps) or $/GB mandates from the FCC, but already we are seeing definitions being made and lines being drawn [5]. There is already language from Wheeler about &quot;responsibility to the 20 percent [without 25down/3up]&quot;, just as there was strong language from Roosevelt about the railway industries.<p>2015 will be an interesting year indeed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Commerce_Commission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Commerce_Commission</a>

You design your CPU so whenever you execute an add instruction with $r1 = x, $r2 = y (say these are the add inputs), the next add instruction will switch to ring-0 mode and run code at address which is the result of the add.<p>2. You don&#x27;t need access to the box. You just get the target to load a site with JS that sets x and y to those specfic values and adds them, and then adds zero to some address you want to execute (which you can aim to be shellcode in a JS string or something, but even if not there are a million tricks you can use to execute arbitrary code if you can run code at an arbitrary address).<p>3.

Obviously if the attacker already has access to the box, he can get root with this exploit.<p>I think a chip backdoor could also be based on information leaking rather than executing arbitrary code.<p>The steps would be:
1. Identify critical info, like crypto keys, from heuristics.  This means keeping a special buffer, since you don&#x27;t know at the beginning of an RSA operation that it&#x27;s an RSA operation.  The heuristics are not perfect, of course, but work with standard apps like Firefox, GPG and Outlook.<p>2. Exfiltrate the info.  Via spread-spectrum RF, timing jitter in packets, or replacing random numbers in crypto.  The article implies that since OSes and apps mix the hardware RNG with other sources, there&#x27;s no point in subverting it.  But the CPU can recognize common mix patterns, like in the Linux kernel, and subvert the final output.<p>In this case the output entropy is good, but also leaks some secret to a listener who has the right keys.",1423105294

4371354,comment,4371057,4371332,9,0,manaskarekar,,,"It's not just the content alone that makes the difference. A few things:<p>- It's the community that makes you feel like a part of something. Compared to popular fitness boards, you don't go to reddit only when you're in the 'trying to lose weight actively' mode. You just go to reddit and then these posts show up in your stream keeping you actively engaged. YMMV of course.<p>- It serves as a gentle break-in to more detailed/technical information. Most of the advice there is usually watered down from some technical sources, which people/FAQs eventually link to in case someone needs more information.<p>The third and perhaps the most important point would be,<p>- people see 'regular joes' like you and me losing xxx pounds and know by their posting history that they're not a made up figment of the advertisers imagination. This works on two levels, not only does it give confidence to the average guy, it also ensures that he's not being fed some bullshit theory in lieu of money.<p>The major fact that people get amazing results without throwing money at the techniques seems to lower the barrier to 'hmm maybe I should try this.'<p>I'm a big time fan of keto and have had great results and I have but r/keto to thank for this.",1344729502

People might not like it or get frustrated that they can't buy the domain at the price they would like. That's simply entitlement. And they also assume that if the ""squatter"" didn't buy the domain it would be just sitting waiting for them to purchase for $10 for their startup. In a free market system that would simply not be the case.<p>Someone thought of an idea and purchased domains at the going rate (or more later on if not the original owner) and now the domain has value. If it was so apparent the domain had value to everyone then everyone would have done the same thing and they didn't. This is really no different than any type of gamble or investing someone does in business or in real estate.<p>You can come up with any scenario to try limit domains to ""actual use"" and it will fail on it's face. There is no way to have the growth of the Internet that we have and police how someone uses their domain. This is not gas or war time rationing. There are many options if the domain that you think is perfect for your company is taken by someone else. Find a different domain. Get over it.",1344729151

As a net-consumer of APIs, I'm not sure I can get behind that.<p>Of course, an API can be expected to change rapidly early in its life. Such APIs are usually not considered ready for serious production use and breaking changes aren't really a big deal. Later on, people tend to expect more stability out of APIs and tend to stop using (or if that's not possible, post strongly-worded rants to HN about) APIs that remove features unexpectedly.<p>There are extreme cases to be sure. Microsoft is famous for keeping new versions of Windows bug-for-bug compatible with the past. Apple, on the other hand regularly deprecates and removes features that see little use. In light of Steve Yegge's recent post about liberal and conservative attitudes in software, I would call Microsoft's position on this issue very conservative and Apple's centrist.<p>I think what the world you're envisioning would actually look like is massive fragmentation, with people maintaining many more forks of libraries that have since removed some important functionality.<p>That's not to say the problem you describe doesn't exist or that there aren't solutions. An appropriate deprecation policy is certainly one part. Another component could be wider use of dynamic binding to help keep certain code out of APIs and in clients. A third could be more effort to keep APIs <i>simple</i> in the sense that Rich Hickey uses the word.",1344728621

4371319,comment,4370562,4370989,8,0,kcl,,,"> The concept of a 'front lawn', or even of easy access to nature in general, has not always been as popular as it is today.<p>The divide between city and country living is ancient. I find most of your assertions based on Jackson hard to swallow. We were almost exclusively agrarian before industrialization. Your article gives the fraction of people living in cities as 1/3 in 1890 in the US. It's more than that today. It seems like lawns and easy access to nature have been around for a long time. If they are more in demand today, maybe it's because there is a natural need that's going unfilled.<p>(If anyone has a good chart of US city vs. non-city dwelling over time, please share.)<p>> As Jackson notes, a front lawn is rather useless except as a status symbol<p>A status symbol? Only if you are looking at it from the perspective of an apartment dweller. Suburban neighborhoods don't think of people in terms of their front yard. They don't think of front yards much at all, except when it comes time to cut them.<p>If your front yard is messy, that might reflect badly on you, but that sort of information will be conveyed in other ways. The front yard won't have much to do with it.<p>I suppose a more accurate way to phrase your argument would be ""ornamentation"". Even then, a front yard is not useless. People like to have space between them and their neighbors. It is a buffer between you and the road, and a place for your children to play. People like to have a space that's theirs.<p>I think it is much more likely that the size of yards is a function of what people find comfortable to have between them and their neighbors, with other factors like cost coming into play second.<p>Why, for instance, do New Yorkers buy their second homes in the surrounding rural areas? Why not another apartment?<p>When I lived in the city I felt cramped. Apartment living taxed my well-being. It's possible this is because of how I grew up. I think it's more likely it's a physical attribute of how I am. Suburbanites are probably the same way.<p>Open up Google Earth and pan over America. Are you suggesting all the front yards you see are equivalent to gold chains, and not some fundamental property of how people want to live?<p>> and they can cut the amount of available space in a neighborhood by 50% or more, making them a truly luxury expense.<p>Again, this could only come from a city perspective. Front yards are easy to get. Everyone who wants one has one. The objective function of a suburban area is not to maximize space efficiency.<p>By the end of your comment you steer the discussion back towards cities in particular---but Jackson is an argument on actual suburbanization, not ""intra-city"" suburbanization. So if you aren't talking about these concepts in general, why predicate your comment on Jackson's book/phenomenon?",1344728442

The last two have been steadily declining, so that leaves tuition as an ever more important source of funds.  The university is building new dormitories to get new paying bodies.  It doesn't matter just how damn incapable the students are, what counts is that they pay.  You can't encourage anyone to drop their chosen degree, if you do you might have to apologize to the chair and the parents.<p>Again, funds are scarce, and the administration tries to hive off teaching of introductory courses to adjuncts.  It takes anyone a year or two to learn the ropes, then people leave because working conditions here are poor, the classes are too large and the workload too heavy.  No one is concerned about the revolving door for introductory courses.  Besides, you have to have an excellent command of the subject matter to be able to teach a beginners' class, you just cannot put a bottom-of-the-barrel type in front of an introductory course and expect the students to do well.<p>Again, it's the undergraduates that pay, and they money goes primarily into teaching facilities.  Meanwhile the research space is neglected.  There is no money to replace the fifty year old rotting tiles in my office, everything goes to provide a nice environment to the dear undergrad kids.<p>Someone might notice that mathematics and computing are peculiar in that there is not much capital equipment or education needed to be productive.

Living a life primarily behind the computer screen while leading an engineering team at a rapidly growing startup (over 100% growth in the last year alone) left little time for me to consider my fitness.<p>I'd eat trash -- burritos four or five times a week, pizza or fast food the rest. I never cooked, because I ""didn't have time."" I didn't work out for the same half-assed reason.<p>I realized in early April that I weighed more than I ever had before, that I was not satisfied in my appearance, and that I was very likely introducing unwanted health issues.<p>Like many other things in my life (coding, managing, infosec, etc.) I took the ""dive deep"" approach into health and fitness.<p>I experimented with several diet and fitness plans, until finally finding one that seemed sustainable for me. I'm not trying to start a flame war about diets -- I've seen far too many of them in the last few months -- but a very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (called ""keto"") works extremely well for me.<p>I found a reddit community (surprise!) called /r/keto that shares recipes, support, and tips with each other. Especially in the beginning of my diet, it was an invaluable resource.<p>I started my keto diet on April 18th, at about 255 lbs. Today I weigh 189.<p>I'm still not where I want to be (yet), but I can personally attest to the extremely kind and supportive atmosphere that reddit provides when working towards a goal like this. We rejoice in each others' victories and help each other through the harder times.<p>That said, there <i>are</i> downsides, too. I already mentioned the diet/exercise flame wars that go on -- for example, Low-Carb/High-Fat (LCHF) diets vs. High-Protein/Low Fat vs. Low-Fat Generalized, etc. I think that each of these diets can work (science supports that), but different people need to figure out what works for them.<p>The problem with these subreddits -- /r/fitness included -- is that they develop a hive-mind towards their respective goal. /r/fitness almost makes a joke of it (""join a gym, quit facebook, get girls""), and ""starting strength"" is recommended all the time, in response to pretty much everything. Not that these are bad recommendations at all, just something that I see a lot.<p>The communities are very welcoming, but when an individual strays from the hive mind, they can also be very <i>dis</i>couraging.<p>Hope this lends a little insight and personality to the article!",1344727322

Most of the insurance company websites will give you back a basic active/inactive response along with the patient's copayment.  For primary care docs this is enough (although its still annoying to go to 100+ websites if you accept a lot of insurance plans).  However; for surgeons, chiropractors, massage therapists, dentists, diagnostic labs, genetic testing facilities, MRI facilities -- this basic information is not even close to enough.  That's where the Eligible API comes in.",1344726323

Since YouTube has a separate takedown system, it doesn't get counted against all those other sites, even though potentially, it has a huge number. We don't know, because Google doesn't report them. I don't think Google's trying to be tricky in doing this. I just think that, as a consequence of how it handles DMCA requests, YouTube is getting a huge pass that other sites won't get.",1344726303

I agree that all this is doable, but you must realize tailoring a vanilla installation with plugins to do all this is really difficult for most programmers. Especially if you want newbies to start with using vim.<p>If people wanted to use an IDE, they would use an IDE- There are plenty available these days. All it takes is going to go to the eclipse website, and downloading one. Why in the world would any body spend hours(days?) hunting all these basic plugins which are must have for today's software development needs?<p>Somethings like auto complete in ST2 looks to just give what the user wants. In vim you would be doomed press ctrl-n as and when you need it, but it happens automatically with ST2.All these modern GUI based editors are basically these many tiny optimization on old concepts .There is also that file browser that gets opened by default on the left hand side. The minimap on the right hand side. The search functionality using ctrl-p. These are few tiny yet useful automations that should ship with vim/emacs by default. I see no reason why they shouldn't. Apart from trying to sell themselves as endlessly customizable editors, they must also do many of tiny day to day needs by default.<p>Things like package managers, a proper good looking GUI et al are must have things in any software tool these days. Arcane 80's style GUI, default tooling support for software development needs going two decades back is not going to fly.",1344726091

When comments disagree with code, code wins. Rather than taking responsibility and learning this, he blames the stupidity of a newbie.",1201290694

We are experts in this area - especially in real estate ;) Feel free to contact me at ch AT streeteasy.com. It is <i>not</i> an easy task to build what you are looking for. We've been building and improving our system for two years now (ruby on rails.) Scraping the data is just one part of the problem. Validating the data is also a big issue. These sites often have incorrect or stale information. MLS's are good, but they may have restrictions on what you can do with the data, or (as in NYC) they may not even exist.",1201290288

104284,story,,,17,33,thorax,"Ask YC: What do you think of our site, bug.gd?",,"http://bug.gd<p>The idea is simple: you search for an error message on bug.gd. If the solution is there, you win. If not, then we'll ask you (48 hours later) how you figured it out. Your answer is saved to help the next lost soul.<p>Our latest news is our launch of a Firefox extension that lets you skip the email reminder aspect, saves some keystrokes (auto-paste), and tracks your unsolved errors.<p>The vision is to get to the point where silly things like computer errors and crashes never need to be solved twice. If someone solves a problem, everyone gets benefit of the answer. We've been asked why users would use the service over searching Google, but we see that as saying you prefer throwing things in the trash over recycling. Some people are like that, but there are many of us that don't want our work to be wasted. As a bonus, since all the solutions submitted are indexed by major search engines, you're helping even those who don't use the site.<p>Back in October we prepopulated the database with 65,000 Microsoft KB article error messages and it's been growing ever since. Let us know what you think, if you have a moment.<p>(And, yeah, the logo is intentionally and subtly buggy. We'll get over our silliness eventually.)",1201289522
104283,comment,102863,104076,0,0,geebee,,,"Eh, maybe.  If the Lisp programmers are truly talented, and this is truly a contrarian play, then you might have to let go of the comparable project/team requirement.<p>As for hiring people to develop and maintain... well, this is probably why it doesn't work for the usual boss/employee relationship.  The employee may quit a job.  But if the employee is a founder or has tons and tons of equity, he'd be quitting on himself.  He will go to the mat to save the company.  He will bust a vessel in his eye before he'll let it fail.<p>Yes, he may end up sprawled out on the mat with a broken eye vessel, but that's the price of freedom, right? ;)",1201289079

104281,comment,102863,104055,0,0,geebee,,,"Perhaps so - like I said, I'm not absolutely sure Lisp is the way to go.  But if it is, this isn't just a crisp $20 nobody has bothered to pick up, it's the mother lode.<p>But I do disagree just a bit with your statement that managers look for the fastest and cheapest way to a product.  THey look for the fastest and cheapest way <i>available to them as managers</i>.  Those three guys probably aren't willing to work for a management type. You could throw money at them, but then you become an investor, not a boss. Which is probably a better deal for you, too.<p>This is another recurrent theme in PGs essays.  The boss/employee relationship doesn't really work.  But the investor/founder relationship works brilliantly.",1201288832

104278,comment,103947,104011,0,0,sanj,,,"""a credit card company which records a higher rate of interest ends up getting a bigger slice of the pie""<p>That's fascinating.  So there's a clear financial incentive to drive the rates up quickly as soon as there's a sign of trouble<p>Would it make sense to remove that incentive?  For example, slice the pie based on principal rather than principal+interest?  Or to add in some consistent rate of interest across all creditors?",1201288336

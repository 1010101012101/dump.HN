Unfortunately I did mess with it a couple times when I got bored with its progress, cranking up the Mutation rate for a few runs to bring in some extra variety; so it would probably be tricky to reproduce intentionally. I&#x27;ve got a new version up and running again, since this one did eventually crash.<p>Definitely weird and interesting.

A boy helps an old woman carry her groceries across the street.  The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., exclaims, &quot;why would he do that!  That&#x27;s not civil disobedience!  It is unjustified!&quot;<p>People can do good things, that are justified, without it being civil disobedience.  If one calls it civil disobedience, then viewed in that light, it gets complicated.  But since it is not civil disobedience (I assert), why do we have to justify it against the standards applied to civil disobedience?  It&#x27;s also not &quot;rule by divine right of Kings&quot; -- is it therefore unjustified by that standard?  It&#x27;s not &quot;because it helps the children&quot;, is it therefore unjustified?  We can go over all the ways that it does not meet how various people justify actions, and still come no closer to looking at his actions for what they are.<p>Clearly, in my mind, this is a case of &quot;whistleblowing&quot;, where someone reveals information that is hurtful to an organization but helpful to the public.  A mafia informant doesn&#x27;t stick around to get whacked, and nobody faults him, because receiving the punishment for violating the secrecy does not help the cause that he is trying to advance.",1372370225

The more we depend on social networks and other online services to share content with friends and family, the more we risk that our content inadvertently becomes public. The enforceability of intellectual property laws around user-generated content  our photos, videos, and other content  is one of the best protections we have. The media has, in many cases, chosen to broadly construe all content shared via these networks as public when in fact much of it is private, and the copyright on that private material belongs to the creator. Sharing photos on Facebook should no more constitute a public license to use those photos than sending them over email.<p>The ubiquitous license agreements and privacy policies that online services force their users to enter into should be scrutinized by the courts around the principle of adhesion, and if the courts are unwilling to reconsider the status quo then congress should intervene with legislation limiting the scope and enforceability of these agreements. We also need to be willing to consider that only Congress can prevent the abuse of governmental power that is used to coerce online services into to turning over data in a wholesale manner.<p>I am certain that social networks, technology companies, and telecommunications companies would prefer not to kowtow to governments around the world, but operating a service on the scale of Facebook or Google puts these companies in the crosshairs of governmental agencies of all kinds. Once a company has reached this scale, only governments pose a meaningful existential threat. It is therefore incumbent upon the legislature to craft appropriate boundaries that strike a balance between the valid needs of governmental authorities and the equally valid privacy demands of Internet users.<p>In the end, the lesson learned from my wedding was something much less obvious than the parable of excess that was claimed. Rather, the democratization of the media that I idealized in my youth when it was just a distant, blurry dream, suddenly seems much less worthy of idolatry now that its become a stark reality. The lesson for me, felt acutely over the past two weeks, ended up being a familiar moral to a familiar story: Be careful what you wish for  you might just get it.

I very often read that the UK joined for the single market but then afterwards the EU started taking away national sovereignty.<p>I don&#x27;t quite understand how this view of things is possible.<p>From the very start, when the Coal and Steel Community was created in 1952, loss of national sovereignty was, to a certain degree, built into the system. The primary goal of European cooperation was to take away the ability of European nations to go to war with one another. Also remember the &quot;de fact solidarity&quot; that Robert Schuman spoke of in his famous declaration in 1950: With all the horrors of WW2 fresh in mind, nobody could expect the people of Europe to show solidarity for another, so the framework of Europe must be set up to generate a &quot;de facto solidarity&quot;. The whole system should be set up in such a way that the people of Europe cannot _not_ show solidarity.<p>We learned this in school and it seems to be generally accepted by the general populace, at least in the &quot;old&quot; continental Western Europe. If you ask older Germans or French about European integration, they will talk about avoiding war, not about the single market.<p>The only possible explanation I can come up with for the sentiment that the EU was &quot;all about the single market&quot; is that UK voters were horribly misled by their press and politicians at the time of EU accession. Is this plausible?<p>On a side note: I admit that what I wrote about hating Europe was harsh, but we (i.e., me and many others I&#x27;ve spoken to) do feel genuinely betrayed.",1372369048

It&#x27;s the little things, the designer is on the right track, simplification is the right direction but...<p>The new 2013 logo is unbalanced & dull.<p>1) First it&#x27;s extremely unbalanced, all the eye popping color, depth, & detail is in the tail with nearly no highlights on the left side of the logo.<p>2) The fur on the end of the tail is 3D, slightly wrapping itself around the globe. Why? Why simplify the whole logo and leave the tail with the same awful complexities as the previous 09-13 logo? The tails in the 04-05 and 05-09 are near perfection and more simple. The newer tails add unnecessary detail yet they were kept.<p>3) It&#x27;s inconsistently flat. Usually flat coincides with simple, but the logo&#x27;s complex outlines have actually been exaggerated while the coloring has been flattened and simplified. The fox&#x27;s head and torso on the other hand were nicely simplified (aside from the little hairs added all over).<p>4) It&#x27;s dull. What was once planet earth is now a dull blue ball with coffee stains.<p>5) The gradient of orange to yellow is too hard. The entire fox is orange then sharply turns to yellow after the tail starts. The gradient change in the 04-05 version is perfect. The new logo&#x27;s gradient is harsh and too distracting.<p>6) Micro-details were added. Why? I thought this was about simplifying? Look at the fox&#x27;s fur on it&#x27;s back. There&#x27;s little tiny hairs that have been added that weren&#x27;t there in the 04-05 and 05-09 version. There&#x27;s no reason for those to be there. When the logo is shrunk and viewed at it&#x27;s normal size they won&#x27;t even be visible, why not just remove them altogether. In fact the ears have added hairs as well.<p>It&#x27;s easily salvageable and the designer was on the right track:<p>Just bright up planet earth, contrast the continents from the ocean more, remove the 3D-ness of the fox&#x27;s tail, further simplify or remove the tail&#x27;s inner fur spikes, and soften the gradient of orange to yellow that runs across the fox&#x27;s body and get rid of those annoying hairs that one can only see when zoomed in 400%.",1372368790

If you follow the arc of culpability throughout the post, Parker assumed that the Hotel was adequately permitted for such activities.  When it turned out that they were not, the Hotel forced Parker into a indemnification agreement (presumably by threatening to cancel the wedding), which means he can&#x27;t sue the Hotel.  Then the Hotel refused to pay the CCC fine, preferring to cancel the wedding instead.  So his only option at the point was to pay for the fines himself.<p>My take away from this is that the hotel is to blame.  They did not have the required permits (despite an assumption on Parker&#x27;s part that they did), and they refused to rectify the situation when it was discovered that there were issues.

I don&#x27;t really have a perspective on that, because I can&#x27;t think of any examples of it, but it seems like a stretch to apply that specific label; thereby diluting (in my mind) the meaning of the term Civil Disobedience.  If we add the qualifier of &quot;indirect&quot;, then it seems that the scope becomes unnecessarily large.  But I think I would need more examples of this to that aren&#x27;t similar to whistleblowing to understand why we need to introduce the term &quot;direct civil disobedience&quot; where &quot;civil disobedience&quot; seems to suit fine.  You give a concrete example for &quot;direct&quot; civil disobedience, but not one for &quot;indirect&quot;.<p>Why don&#x27;t we like &quot;whistleblowing&quot;?  It seems that this exactly describes what he did.  Is there a connotation associated with whistleblowing that I&#x27;m not aware of?

Remember that? Of course you do. You probably text people on a regular basis. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) have benefited from this asynchronous form of short messaging for years and have collected hefty revenues from it as well. In fact, Portio Research estimates SMS revenues will top $150 Billion this year alone. But MNOs aren&#x27;t they only ones benefiting. Texting has led to all types of uses beyond just communicating with another person; it has led to branded campaigns, voting and of course spam.<p>However, as MNOs start to enter the third phase of the sigmoid or S-curve growth model as service providers, SMS in many markets is starting to enter the detrimental &quot;substitution&quot; stage of decline where users are finding new, better and cheaper alternatives to SMS, namely Over The Top (OTT) messaging providers such as Whatsapp, Kik, Snapchat and even Facebook Messenger along with a seemingly endless array of other OTT apps. According to McKinsey, users in South Korea and The Netherlands have already tipped away from SMS where the move to OTT messaging apps is having a material impact on the MNOs SMS volumes and revenues. Essentially, people are texting so much less that it is impacting the MNOs&#x27; business.",1372368110

5954724,comment,5954355,5954521,5,0,dangrossman,,,"2% is below CNP interchange on a lot of card types. For example, it costs <i>the processor</i> 2.95% to charge a Platinum MasterCard or 2.05% to charge a World MasterCard card as CNP. A processor charging less than interchange is taking a loss; it&#x27;s paying the merchant more than it&#x27;ll get funded by charging that card.<p>The flat-rate pricing these new aggregators offer at 2.7-2.9% already builds in taking a loss on some cards by making it up on ones with cheaper interchange rates. To go below 2% flat rate and make a profit is near impossible. The only place you&#x27;ll find that is somewhere like PayPal, with $100k/mo or more in volume and a negotiated contract, and they can get away with 1.9% because many of their payments are balance-funded or ACH-funded at nearly no cost.<p>2.2-2.5% is much more realistic and you&#x27;ll still need a minimum monthly volume to get it.<p>Or we can all set up retail stores and abandon this e-commerce stuff. Rates are much lower when you can swipe a physical card. The real profit-taking is happening in those card readers you can pick up at Staples/BestBuy/etc from Square/PayPal/Intuit/GoCardless where they&#x27;re collecting 2.7-2.9% and paying half that in interchange.",1372367523

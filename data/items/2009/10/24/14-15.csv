I believe the Coulombic fraction is larger than 50%, but the other part is certainly non-negligible.",1256396396

They don't add value.  If you like something, up-vote it with the arrows.<p>If you want to gain karma, make useful comments that add value for the audience that's here, and submit items that people here will find interesting.<p>But first, you'll need to know what people like, so you'll need to hang around a bit and see what gets up-voted, and what gets down-voted.

900496,comment,900086,900086,0,0,rick_2047,,,"Well in my opinion the graduates from the so-called elite Universities with a science or tech. degree are not at all supposed to found a startup at all. I mean they are trained in the finest art of making things possible by using science and engineering not giving a sales speech or making a marketing strategy. These are the things to be done by people from management schools.<p>Also if a engineering graduate is willing to start a start up he would first like to go to a management grad school. Like the example the author gave for the IIT students, they are not at all trained in even the nominal management skills. The sole purpose of an IIT is to make a promising engineer. The indian government set up these IITs to give india some quality engineers. Not start up people.If he had to look at the start up scene in India he should have taken a look at IIM grads. I dont exactly know about others but the best IIM, the IIM - Ahmedabad is in my city and I know definitely that there graduates are more inclined towards making a start up than getting a job. Also IIM also provides funding to make it much easier for them.",1256395940

Dynamically linking with C is very easy in Windows too, which is more prevalent than Unix.<p>I should have qualified that my statement was referring to statically typed functional languages, though; the strategies required for runtime parametric polymorphism are quite different to those required for just compile-time parametric polymorphism, and statically typed functional languages generally encourage flow of types throughout the forest of functional expressions, by which I mean that compile-time parametric polymorphism is very much sufficient before dynamic linking and polymorphic - runtime polymorphic - APIs have been considered.<p>I have tried neither xmonad nor yi, though yi looks interesting. The choice of testimonials for xmonad on their site is amusing, though - ""I have to say, the greatest thing about xmonad thus far is its insane stability... I have zero issues with xmonad"". Stability is the absence of certain kinds of defects, not a positive feature - I for one have never suffered from e.g. lack of stability in the Windows window manager.",1256395163

Many organizations, unfortunately, simply aren’t executing on all cylinders when it comes to sales and marketing.""<p>It's a cop-out to say ""there's no point in trying because of the recession"".  But it's silly to imply the recession is completely unrelated to flagging sales.<p>""Do you sound desperate?""<p>I agree with this point, though I think it goes a lot deeper than the remarks he makes.  A sale is based on meeting the needs of the customer, not on the customer meeting your (desperate) need for money.  Keep your eye on the ball and keep working on offering something of value.  Fortunes are made and lost during both busts and booms.  During The Great Recession of the 1930's, car sales were down but bicycle sales were up.  Second-hand stores thrived.  If I recall correctly, frozen french fries and dried onions were invented and were a hit because they offered cost-savings to the customer. People still had to eat.  Helping them eat adequately for less cost was a good market to go after.",1256393851

If they got Android onto it, I'd upgrade in a heartbeat.<p>They also know how to differentiate without creating fragmentation. Most Android products suffer because of fragmentation - different OS versions, different hardware, etc. Nokia should know to create a core platform or 2 (standard screen size, hopefully upgrade support), and then make money on marketing prettier models to the people who'll buy them.<p>It's obvious that they need Android, maybe with some ""value added"" features tacked on (but not in a tacky way).<p>OK, crappy feature phones may be ""good enough"", but mobile phones has always been something of a fashion business.

The reason of ""it's too much work"" is the same answers given time and time again to the sites only designed for platform X, but that's not a good reason to do something when the platform you're delivering it on is by definition a network of variable capability platforms.<p>It's fine if we want to try to push the state of the art of rich internet apps, but at what point do we stand back and realize that we're not building a website (a collection of HTML documents on the world wide web) but rather delivering a javascript executable to our user that just happens to be renderable in most modern web browsers?<p>I don't mean to single you out, it's something that we all having to deal with, but is there anyone at the standards organizations that are listening to the pulse of the new web?

I think Nokia is toast.<p>At the end of the day, you can't create a best-of-breed product out of nowhere.  You need the core competencies to be already present in your company's DNA.<p>Palm came back out of nowhere and created in the Pre a phone with great usability fundamentals, and an incredibly innovative contact/data management layer.  But that didn't come from nowhere.... those are exactly the things that the Palm Pilot excelled at.<p>Apple created a phone with incredible industrial design that pushed the boundaries of what was possible in a category of device.  These things, also, have lots of precent at Apple, in the Macintosh, the iPod, OS X, and the iTunes music store.<p>Google, in Android, built a phone OS that has incredible integration with networked apps, and is built on a well run open source project.  But before they started, they already had the best network app development teams in the world, and many world class open source developers and evangelists on staff.<p>What does Nokia have? I'm honestly not that familiar with their history, but they appear to have had (at one time) world class supply chain management and global distribution. And solidly built hardware? Is that it?<p>Honestly, I think Nokia had the right DNA to make a huge contribution to cell phones when they were a brand new, untested product with limited global reach.  But now that those issues have been nailed, the distribution channels are in place, and everyone's phones, from Motorola's Android phones to LG's crappy feature phones are ""good enough"" for the people who buy them.<p>My guesses for the big future developments in phones are the web maturing as a development platform (Google seems positioned to ride that wave), powerful new software APIs (social, location, augmented reality, AI, etc), new media distribution models (Netflix, iTunes, Shopify, etc), and of course design-driven expansion of the user experience (Flipboard, FaceTime, Google Maps, etc).<p>I don't see product teams at Nokia who appear to be executing in any of these areas at the level that would be necessary to dominate in them.

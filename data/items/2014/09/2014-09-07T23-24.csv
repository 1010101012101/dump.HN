That certainly works, at least with electronic or continuously variable instruments. But even within one diatonic scale in a single key, it&#x27;s impossible to have a fixed set of frequencies such that the intervals are correct in all of the diatonic triads.<p>I suppose you could shift individual frequencies based on the <i>chord</i> currently being played, but I&#x27;m not sure how that would sound.",1410134391

8282842,comment,8281332,8281332,6,0,jbapple,,,"> The disadvantage of set theory is that its principles are very difficult to translate into the programming language of a proof assistant.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. There&#x27;s an Isabelle theory for ZF, and the ZF axioms are actually simpler than the axiomatic system that Coq uses, the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.<p>Backing up for a second, I&#x27;m just not sure how HoTT will make using proof assistants so much simpler. I&#x27;ve done a couple of largish (> 1000 lines) proof developments in Coq. The hardest part never seemed to me to be that mismatch between CIC and ZF. The hard part was that proofs are actually hard to do in a careful and complete way. The proofs I did in math class were easy because we left out a lot of the details.<p>Let me give an example. This is from the HoTT book, Book version: first-edition-611-ga1a258c, page 368:<p>&quot;The field of rationals Q is constructed along the\nsame lines as well, namely as the quotient<p>Q : ≡ ( Z × N ) / ≈<p>where<p>( u, a ) ≈ ( v, b ) : ≡ ( u ( b + 1 ) = v ( a + 1 )) .<p>In other words, a pair ( u, a ) represents the rational number u/ ( 1 + a ) . There can be no division\nby zero because we cunningly added one to the denominator a. Here too we have a canonical\nchoice of representatives, namely fractions in lowest terms. Thus we may apply Lemma 6.10.8\nto obtain a set Q, which again has a decidable equality.<p>We do not bother to write down the arithmetical operations on Q as we trust our readers\nknow how to compute with fractions even in the case when one is added to the denominator.\nLet us just record the conclusion that there is an entirely unproblematic construction of the or-\ndered field of rational numbers Q, with a decidable equality and decidable order. It can also be\ncharacterized as the initial ordered field.&quot;<p>If you have experience with using proof assistants, you know how handwavy this is compared to the work required to actually get this done. Here&#x27;s that development in Coq right now:<p><a href=""https://github.com/coq/coq/tree/trunk/theories/QArith"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coq/coq/tree/trunk/theories/QArith</a><p>Does HoTT really make these things simpler to write and prove?

There is a noticeable step up in features from the typical open source / free software implementations to something like Allegro CL or LispWorks. Since both a proprietary and relatively expensive, often they are not a choice. But the fact remains, that they offer more and better features. SBCL shines with some features of its compiler.

Since they don&#x27;t, they are viewed as liars when they claim that they don&#x27;t want to use it. And they very well can be liars. Let them prove their intentions with actions rather than with empty words.<p><i>> That someone is consumers, not Netflix.</i><p>No, that&#x27;s false logic. Users of course should push for it too. But you can&#x27;t compare the scale. Individuals voting with their wallets are less visible to publishers than distributors voting with theirs. GOG already demonstrated it. And that actually feeds the cycle. Once some distributor breaks the wall of stupidity by making some DRM-free deals with publishers, then more users start supporting them from those who care about buying it DRM-free.<p>The bottom line, Neflix are not interesting in fighting that fight. They oblige insane publishers willingly and their claims that they &quot;have no choice&quot; don&#x27;t sound sincere.<p><i>> Netflix has little incentive to care about it also</i><p>That&#x27;s exactly the point. So they can&#x27;t claim that they don&#x27;t like it. In the best case they don&#x27;t care, and in the worst they prefer using it even for their own content and push for that garbage into HTML standard. Incentive for caring about it should not come from estimating how many users care about it.<p><i>> ll that still doesn&#x27;t change the fact if Netflix could, they would most likely drop DRM, if not for all the technical reasons</i><p>That&#x27;s what they say, but no one is inclined to believe them when they don&#x27;t do it for their own content as above.

The ads themselves are not all managed at the highest level: There are national ads, regional ads, local ads... A big part of what a TV network does is manage the ads themselves.<p>While a large majority of the fans have broadband, they don&#x27;t necessarily have something connected to the TV that will output the NFL streaming apps to their living room. There&#x27;s also no proof that advertisers would pay the same rates for ads than they do for over the air TV.<p>Handing out the rights to TV stations also has all kinds of other advantages. You don&#x27;t have to pay the TV stations to advertise the games. There is all kinds of content in said stations that could also be considered advertising: A team will be covered more in the channel that also carries the games than in one that does not. If you have an NFL app as the way to show the games, now you are the one paying the TV stations so that they cover your stuff. The NFL might get a bigger share of the pie, but other people are a whole lot less interested in helping the NFL grow its fan base. And yeah, the moment you start offering all games online bypassing live broadcasts, without at least a modicum of an attempt of blacking out regular TV broadcasts, the networks will balk at you, so if a pro sports league wants to move to online, they have to either only show content that the local TV stations do not want, or go all in, because the TV networks are not going to be happy competing with the league directly with the same content.<p>Good luck keeping an attempted switch secret too: To move broadcasts inhouse, a league would either have to purchase new equipment and crews, from the engineers at the stadium to the commentators, or to downright poach them, neither of which is easy to do.<p>So even if it&#x27;s theoretically possible they&#x27;d make more money online, the risks and the political costs of doing such things are tough.

For each label L in a program, the programmer should state a logical assertion α(L) which is to be true whenever we reach L. Then the axioms<p><pre><code>    {α(L)} go to L {false}\n</code></pre>\nplus the rules of inference<p><pre><code>    {α(L)} S {P} ⊢ {α(L)} L:S {P}\n</code></pre>\nare allowed in program proofs, and all properties of labels and go to&#x27;s will follow if the α(L) are selected intelligently. One must, of course, carry out the entire proof using the same assertion α(L) for each appearance of the label L, and some choices of assertions will lead to more powerful results than others.<p>&quot;Informally, α(L) represents the desired state of affairs at label L; this definition says essentially that a program is correct if α(L) holds at L and before all &quot;go to L&quot; statements, and that control never &quot;falls through&quot; a go to statement to the following text. Stating the assertions α(L) is analogous to formulating loop invariants.

The other options in this small town were cable, but with a dial-up uplink or Hughes satellite.<p>Sprint was a great ISP, downtime was perhaps two times over the years. CenturyLink purchased the phone and DSL from Sprint, and coasted along on Sprint&#x27;s old infrastructure for a about a year then the bandwidth exhaustion set it. First it was the peak times that were unusable, then it was just about anytime day or night that latency was through the roof. Fixing it was just around the corner.

8282740,comment,8280730,8280730,1,0,DigitalSea,,,"I can see this from both angles. The first angle is, the mayor has gone ahead and from what I gather from the story, secretly withheld the agreement and failed to inform the locals or even let them have a say/voice their opinion. People just want to be heard, and when local politicians go making decisions that affect the town (however big or small) without consulting the inhabitants, of course people are going to be angry about this.<p>Then you can see it from the other angle. The $500k sum is just a fee for the company to have the right to have the party, think of it as a leasing fee. When you factor in all of the other things like accommodation, food, labour, cabling, generators, lighting and the fact 1000 people flocking to local stores, staff, law enforcement/security and then the clean-up, presumably that is going to significantly boost the local economy quite a lot.<p>If the party is properly controlled and constrained within the designated street, is it really hurting anyone? Financially hotels/motels are going to be the biggest winners and probably rarely experience an influx of 1000+ visitors at once staying for 3 days. Aside from the fact a company that produces alcoholic beverages is throwing a party and potentially sending the wrong message to some, put aside the moral indifference and it&#x27;s just a controlled party being attended by young young young.<p>The inhabitants against the party need to understand they live in a town most likely being kept alive by tourists anyway. There will always be resistance to any kind of change (however temporary), especially those who spent a lot of money moving there (investors and retirees especially). The drinking and partying is already happening (albeit on a small scale) and like pointed out, will give the local economy a significant boost and could potentially result in some of the attendees coming to the party liking the place and coming back for a holiday at a later time. This party has also generated a lot of publicity for the town, people that haven&#x27;t heard of the place before might be more inclined to visit now that they&#x27;ve heard of it.<p>I can see the good and bad, and unless I am just being ignorant and not seeing the bigger picture, it seems the good outweighs the bad in this situation.",1410130956

I think it&#x27;s mainly a marketing problem because people are always reading comments like this online, or hearing about such-and-such series that &quot;is on Netflix&quot; but disappointingly isn&#x27;t currently available in the UK, while simultaneously being unaware of all the content that is available in the UK but not in the US.<p>For example, Netflix UK has the first 2 Hobbit movies, Pixar&#x27;s Up, the original Danish versions of The Killing and The Bridge, all of Stargate SG-1/Atlantis, 24 and The Shield - none of which are currently available in the US. There&#x27;s a load more I can&#x27;t remember off the top of my head. The UK also got Breaking Bad a few hours after it was aired in the US, whereas US customers had to wait several months, presumably due to an exclusivity deal with AMC.<p>Obviously the UK also gets all the Netflix original content. Occasionally a new season will launch a few months ahead in the US, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal. I can only assume this is done for same marketing reasons that blockbuster movie launches are typically staggered worldwide.<p>There are a small number of US shows like 30 Rock and Better Off Ted that I wish were on the UK service, and Star Trek DS9 is conspicuously absent, but that list is much smaller than it was 2 years ago.",1410130822

1329269,comment,1329081,1329105,0,0,abossy,,,"I pursued this idea with randomwalker for about 6 months before realizing there's absolutely no business value here. My advice to Nowmov: choose another market before it's too late. We did, and it's been going much better for us. Fortunately, we didn't come across a strong celebrity endorsement like Ashton Kutcher's, so there was little cost to switching gears.<p>The problem with video recommendations is content ownership. YouTube has a monopoly on user-generated content so they immediately became our number one risk. Our business was henceforth bound to their ToS. Shortly after we switched gears, the Totlol debacle surfaced on Hacker News, confirming our suspicions that the risk was too great for a business to tolerate.<p>The main obstacle with the YouTube ToS is that they don't allow advertising on pages where the video content is the focal point of the page. Nowmov clearly focuses on videos, so the 'get-big-and-strike-it-rich' model is not an option for them. Moving beyond YouTube -- say, using licensed content -- cripples their product, because there simply isn't enough content to create a compelling recommendation engine. Even Hulu, being backed by industry giants, is bleeding content providers.<p>I can't emphasize this enough: this is a cool product, but not a good business. We had cool algorithms that provided fantastic recommendations and kept users on our alpha site for an average of 13 minutes before adding any type of social features. ""Pandora for videos"" was dead simple to pitch, too. I wish NowMov the best of luck and I hope they can succeed where we failed. The world needs a product like this.",1273280062

For example: Let's say Firefox implements an API for Webcams. Will MS implement the exact same API in IE? Unlikely. First of all, the have Silverlight (i am supposing that Silverlight can access the Webcam as well, but don't know for sure). MS wants to push Silverlight and defend IE marketshare. With MS blocking this feature, it essentially means that noone will use it because every website is developed with the first requirement ""Has to reach the vast majority of users"", which in the end means ""IE support"".
They would eventually develop an own API, which turns out to be incompatible to Firefox' API if pressure is high enough.<p>Now, if you have the thought ""but if MS/Apple/Google/Mozilla/Opera would agree on that new API"", that's what the standardization process is all about.",1273279370

1329217,comment,1329033,1329158,0,0,buster,,,"Delivering a cross platform environment that provides the same functionality with more features.<p>Don't get me wrong here, the first sentence may sound as Flash ""fanboyism"", but i think it is rather objective.
Let me explain:<p>- Flash Apps work on Windows/MacOSX/Linux/smartphones/tablets with the exact same API and no difference in implementation of that API (in contrast to IE/Webkit/Opera/Firefox that implement different features and even differ in details when it comes to the implementation of HTML5/CSS3)<p>- Flash offers additional APIs that are not available in HTML5 (Webcam access for example)<p>- taking this further, Air enables cross platform installers, integration into the OS, even more APIs<p>And this can be explained really good, because Adobe can implement new features much faster than HTML standard committees can agree on new HTML features (plus a variety browsers that need to support those). So this shouldn't surprise anyone. It's wishful thinking when people claim that HTML5 can replace Flash in _every_ regard (and here i mean 100% alternative, which can't be true if you just take the webcam access).
HTML5 can replace the majority of todays Flash applications. 
At least i can't think of many web sites that depend on Flash that wouldn't be possible with HTML5 (Websites that make use of Webcams being one of them). And i hope all those navigational elements, advertisings and whatever people chose Flash for, will be replaced with proper HTML in the future!
To implement a full fledged multimedia website is harder with HTML5 than with Flash, imo (think of cross browser compliance and difference in performance between browsers).<p>Just to make my standpoint clear: I would not create a website with Flash nowadays, even if it means less effort. HTML5 is for the web. Flash should die. The ""fact"" that it can be extremely difficult to create those web sites remains, though.<p>Regarding the article:<p>Am i missing something or isn't this just another JS-framework? There are already hundreds of them out there, why is this labeled as ""Flash alternative""? Unless i am missing a point this looks like nothing fundamentally new.

Kids who climb on rocks. )<p>* (to a developer) Tell me about what _YOU_ do. Could you describe your day-to-day routine to me? (It's open-ended, and certain answers, like 'rock back-and-forth, in the corner, in the fetal position, cradling a rifle' or 'ASP.NET programming' are sure signs that you might want to stay clear. Good answers include 'something different every day' and 'sneaking into homes to steal pens'.)<p>* What would you imagine that I would be doing, here? (""Mopping."")<p>* What are your opinions and policies on ongoing education, here?  Do you have resources? Do employees attend conferences? (Some companies will laugh you out of the office, and/or point at their tiny 'reference shelf', many others support this sort of initiative. It's best to gauge this before you ask the question.)<p>* Try to identify things that your interviewers seem especially proud of, and ask them about those things - even if you already know the answer, they will be happy to talk about them. (Say, for example, the HR person repeatedly mentions the innovative ""80/20"" policy. Despite that you know what an 80/20 policy is, like the back of your freaking hand... ask questions about it, to show interest. )<p>* Who, exactly, put the ram in the ramma-lamma-ding dong?<p>* What sort of source control do you use? (This is seriously important.  You might get stuck using something vile like CVS or SourceSafe.  On top of that, asking this question demonstrates that you are aware of the importance of source control, a point that you could always drive home.)<p>A couple of more-precise but ultimately not-that-useful technical questions can help, too.  If a company is doing web technology, ask them what sort of hosting arrangement that they have, whether or not they have a dedicated sysadmin, whether or not they have a development/production split, how changes get moved from development to production, if they do code reviews, what development methodology they prefer, etcetera, etcetera.<p>And you must always, always blow on the pie.

To the customer who values the item (Wii/Sporting Event/whatever) over the (inflated) cost, it is a net gain, not a loss.</i><p>That is too short sighted of an analysis. Too much value is being lost by unnecessary overhead. Have you noticed how overhead is something to be eliminated by every company except the middleman's themselves?<p>With your reasoning, would it be a ""net gain"" for someone pay more for oxygen than you if some scalper managed to monopolize all the oxygen? There are probably plenty of people richer than you that would pay for the ""true"" (sarcasm) value of oxygen. Would it be a ""net gain"" for someone to buy up all the land and charge a million euros per square acre? Somehow, I think your answer to this question will still be yes, but I hope I've managed to convince everyone else.<p><i>Furthermore, scalpers who wait in line for hours to buy tickets/game systems, and then flip it for profit are essentially providing a paid service to those who are too impatient, late, or otherwise incapable of buying said items when they go on sale, knowing that there is a limited supply that will not meet all the demand.</i><p>There are plenty of people who were willing to buy it for the initial price instead of the inflated amount.<p>The problem here is that you are using the broken window fallacy. Just because someone artificially jacked up the ""demand"" of an item doesn't mean that the item is really worth more.<p>Take for example the recent housing bubble.

The market for startups makes it possible for promising startups to raise capital.  It also ""encourages"" ""bad"" startups to die.<p>It's capital allocation.<p>Same thing for the public markets.  They give companies access to capital (either through debt or equity) at a cost that's proportional to how valuable the company is, or is likely to become.<p>So society, through the open markets, gives Apple and GE the opportunity to raise capital.<p>Dying public companies, on the other hand, have a really high cost of capital.<p>And my favorite way to think of capital is man-hours.<p>So if you were king, and you were responsible for allocating man-hours to different projects, this is the same problem as capital allocation, and it's the same problem that securities markets solve.<p>They also provide liquidity and at scale the operational overhead goes to zero.<p>They also provide opportunities for investors to hedge against inflation, participate in society's long term growth, etc.<p>But the most important function from a societal standpoint IMO is very efficient capital allocation.",1259828591

My early encounters with trolling were that it was your fairly basic ribbing of friends, nothing particularly malicious. Nowadays, anything and everything seems to be labelled as trolling when I feel that the circumstances with malicious intent would be better labelled as griefing. Not only do I think griefing is a more apt description for the behaviour being associated with trolling, I think it allows for a distinction between harmless fun and out-to-cause-harm when describing activity on the internet.<p>Proper distinction between the two modes would, imo, help keep frames of reference and hopefully prevent knee-jerk reactions to what is currently labelled as trolling affecting a more wide variety of interactions.<p>Also, it would probably help a lot when the next newbie asks you what ""trolling"" means as well.",1349229291

You could gather information from across a whole host of resources (imdb, movie ticket / record sales, tabloid sites, twitter, spotify plays) to come up with predicted performance forecasts for each celebrity.

4605332,comment,4605139,4605139,1,0,EvaPeron,,,"A function is a type, is a set, is a number. And that, frankly, is difficult to get around. Coming from the C / Java world, it is hard to understand that ""types"" are really sets (in a mathematical sense) which in turn, are numbers (i.e. the set of natural integers), and a function (in terms of the value it returns) is a number as well and can be considered as being an ""operation"" upon a set, i.e., put set A into set B and one has set C. Function == Type == Set == Number, or, perhaps, a Number is simply an instance of a Set which in turn is another way of saying Type, so, basically, Function == Set. What makes it conceptually difficult is that the word ""function"" entails ""operation"", which entails ""time"", when, really, one could think of ""function"" as sort of being ""those steps one has to go through in order to define a set of type S"".<p>A set is a theorem, so now we have, Theorum == Type == Set == Number. A function is simply the way of defining or proving the Theorum, e.g. if set A == B, and B == C, then A == C is a function, which itself is a Set, conjoining A and C.<p>The ""type"" of an object (integer, char, whatever) is really a Set, and the way to construct that set (also being itself a set) is a function, which is what one might call a ""program"".<p>These things are different ways of looking at the same thing. A ""type"" (set) is the Theorum, its proof is the function (program which constructs the Theorum or Set).<p>The only difference between function/program and Set/Theorum is the former ""constructs"" the later, the former being ""temporal"" the latter being ""eternal"" or put it another way, the former being the ""building blocks"" the latter being the ""finished product"".<p>So yes pointers are numbers, which though are Sets, constructed by functions and these sets construct the Theorums. The type is the Theorum, the function is the construction of that Theorum, done vis-a-vis Sets and that is what (IMHO) that thing which we call ""computer science"" is all about. :-)",1349227707

4605289,comment,4603847,4605181,61,0,jofer,,,"Just for the sake of explanation, here are some of the reasons (I'm a geophysist, currently working in the oil industry, but my dissertation work relied heavily on the Chikyu (the ship in question)):<p>1: The ocean is the only place where it's feasible.  The continents have much, much thicker crust (40-70km) than the ocean basins (7-15km). Areas of exposed oceanic crust (e.g. Iceland) have much thicker than normal oceanic crust.<p>Beyond that, it's (slightly) easier to ""drill"" through water than through rock. There are a still a _lot_ of challenges involved in deep-water riser drilling. You don't just have a what's basically a steel rod going down (as you would with riserless drilling), you have to have a system that's capable of returning fluids and maintaining high pressure going all the way down to the seafloor (and below, once you case the well). However, it's still faster to deploy the riser than it is to drill through solid rock.  At any rate, I'm getting sidetracked. The locations where they're looking to drill to the moho are in relatively shallow water (3-4 km) compared to the water depths that the Chikyu has already drilled in.<p>2: You're misunderstanding how drilling works. :) In some sense, what you've described is exactly how it works.  (Just think of the drillbit as the robot.) However, you have to overcome the pressures at the depth you're drilling at (otherwise the hole will collapse, among other things) and you need an efficient way to return the cuttings (waste material) to the surface.  Thus: drilling mud. You circulate pressurized (and very dense, so that the pressure increases with depth) fluid that flushes the cuttings back to the surface and keeps the borehole open. (It's an oversimplification, but that's the basic idea.) In some cases (e.g. coil tubing rigs), this fluid is even what drives the drillbit.<p>At any rate, hopefully that helps illuminate things a touch. :)",1349226912

4605249,comment,4604555,4604555,8,0,rybosome,,,"Developing a large web application in Drupal from October 2011 to May 2012 was, by far, the most stressful period of my professional life. The most difficult part is that the vast majority of learning materials for Drupal are aimed at non-developers. So much literature is dedicated to impressing people who otherwise couldn't create a website with things like, ""LOOK! You can implement access control, put a smiley face next to all comments, AND have a YouTube video feed!"" that finding documentation on actual code is extremely challenging.<p>Another aspect of the project that was difficult was that the client had very specific needs. In almost every piece of functionality they requested, there was some wrinkle that made using an off-the-shelf module impossible. This meant having to code against the behemoth Drupal API. After about 3 months of work, I created an OO-wrapper module around Nodes called Doodal (<a href=""https://github.com/rybosome/doodal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rybosome/doodal</a>) that makes it possible to code in an MVC-like way. This made the rest of the project somewhat easier, minus the parts that involved interfacing with native Drupal. Drupal was created at a time when PHP didn't have object oriented features. Their solution to the problem of needing OO-like behavior but not having it was to emulate it, which is an abstraction that quickly falls apart. For instance, the shortest line of PHP you could possibly write to simply print out an optional ""first name"" value from a node representing a person is...<p>array_key_exists('und', $person->first_name) ? $person->first_name['und'][0]['safe_value'] : '';<p>While I was wrapping up this project, a friend of mine pointed me to an opening his company had for a Drupal dev, paying about 1.8x what I was making at the time. I declined without even thinking about it, and have not regretted it for a second.",1349226116

The author is arguing that he could have alternatively made $10mm in two years if he hadn't have sold.<p>But of course $1mm in a day is a much better return than $10mm in 2 years.  And of course the trader's money wasn't sitting idly since this trade -- he was probably making other illegal trades based on non-public info -- so in the end his return might have been much higher than if he had bought and held after the private information became public.",1299308026

Then when you quote your price, it is way over what they were thinking so they go elsewhere.<p>Discrimination? Yes.  But, like a resume, you don't want to give people anything that could take you out of the running before you've had a chance.<p>If they ask you where you're located, don't lie but don't bring it up either unless they do first.<p>I would also spice up the About page and say more about what you offer and why you are good to work with.<p>Also, I like the VLC website.

10787610,comment,10786300,10787216,0,0,Captain_Usher,,,"The difference is whether the decision is based on where the money is today or where the money&#x27;s been historically.<p>The board game analogy is pretty apt. In The Settlers of Catan, players compete to reach 10 Victory Points by developing a robust and healthy colony. Settlements are worth one VP each, and upgrading one to a city makes it worth two. The city also pays out double resources, and it&#x27;s relatively difficult to stop a player from building cities. I might observe that players who win tend build all their settlements and upgrade as many of them into cities as possible, so I decide going into this game that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do. I decided on that strategy without actually taking this game&#x27;s state into account, and I will probably not do very well if this game is unlike games I&#x27;ve seen before.<p>Alternately, I might just build whatever seems appropriate given the resources I&#x27;m getting. This is &quot;playing the board.&quot; The strategy for this game is based on the current game&#x27;s state, not general knowledge of the game&#x27;s rules in a vacuum or observations of prior games.<p>If someone studies historical trends and concludes that people with skills related to broadly applicable inventions will get paid a lot, like people who can make steam engines or program computers, they&#x27;re using the first strategy. They didn&#x27;t look at today&#x27;s conditions at all, they noted that life in general seems to cause good salaries and specific types of skills to coexist. If they instead just show up to their first day of college, look up the average starting salaries for recent graduates in every department, and join one with the highest number that they feel confident they can graduate from, they&#x27;re using the second strategy. The end result could be identical and they wind up writing software either way, but the strategies were formed using totally different methods.",1450947523

This is not an argument for any long tail, just an argument for inaction because we don’t know what might happen and can never know unless we try. If our ancestors had taken the same approach we would still be living in trees being eaten by wild animals.<p>What those propounding the precautionary principle forget is the do nothing approach is not cost free. 700 million people are made ill every year by mosquitoes and more than a million killed. Unless the risk adjusted consequences are greater than this then doing nothing is far worse. No one has been able to suggest any possible bad consequences of wiping out all human disease carrying mosquitos so there is nothing to be precautionary about [1].<p>As for the technology it is already in the wild - it was originally isolated from bacteria.

10787585,comment,10778946,10787562,0,0,msackman,,,"Hi, I&#x27;m the author of GoshawkDB. Thanks for your questions - they&#x27;re certainly not answered on the website so I&#x27;ll do my best to answer them here and incorporate them into the website later.<p>> Curious how this works at scale. For example if a node is down and N requests start blocking, is there an upper bound to N? What happens when this is reached? Does N map to a goroutine? A file descriptor? Is there timeouts?<p>The blocking actually occurs on a per-client basis: when a client submits a txn to the server to which it&#x27;s connected, that server will calculate which other server nodes need to be contacted in order for the txn to be voted on. If it cannot find enough servers due to failures then it will outright reject the txn and tell the client that there are currently too many failures going on.<p>However, the server could find the right set of server nodes and send off the txn to be voted on and send of the txn for verification and validation. Right at that point there could be further failures and so it&#x27;s not known how far those messages got. It is in this case that the txn could block as until some node recover it&#x27;s impossible to safely abort the txn. But it&#x27;s important to note that:<p>1. If a txn starts blocking, that&#x27;ll block just that txn and that client (as the client is blocked waiting on the outcome of the txn). No other part of the server or any other server is affected.<p>2. Other clients can be submitting other txns at the same time that need different un-failed nodes to proceed, and they progress just fine.<p>3. There is no global determination (yet) of whether a node is failed or not. Thus this approach can cope with really weird network issues - eg random connections between different nodes failing. There is no need for the whole remaining cluster to agree that nodes X, Y and Z are &quot;out&quot; - none of the algorithms depend on that sort of thing.<p>I hope this answers your questions.",1450946690

Most freelancers I know live a pretty variable life where you get feast & famine cycles.  And when it&#x27;s feast time, it&#x27;s long hours time.

There&#x27;re plenty of storages with same strong consistency model (tolerates F failures of 2F+1 nodes), among them are Cassandra with lightweight transactions, Riak with consistent buckets, CockroachDB and ZooKeeper.<p>The point I was trying to make is the decoupling between cluster size and F. ZK, for example, requires that the cluster size is exactly 2F+1, not is minimum 2F+1. That means that as the cluster size increases, performance will decrease as more nodes have to be contacted.<p>> Can you please describe the algorithm that you use for implementing distributed transactions?<p>Yes. In detail, there will be a blog post forthcoming. However the two main points is that 2PC is replaced by Gray and Lamport&#x27;s paper &quot;Consensus on transaction Commit&quot;, and dependencies between transactions are modelled through vector clocks. As I&#x27;m visiting lots of family over xmas, I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t have the 12+ hours necessary to document the entire algorithm just at the moment. However, I will certainly get to this asap.<p>> Do you use the same approach?<p>I don&#x27;t know.

I&#x27;ve been making a half-hearted effort to learn Spanish the past few months. Recently someone was trying to teach me a handful of rules and I kept trying to tell them &#x27;I don&#x27;t care, it doesn&#x27;t matter if, at this stage, I use the wrong verb ending, or even if I say araña (spider) instead of naranja (orange), it won&#x27;t matter so long as you know I&#x27;m trying to ask for an orange to eat or tell you there&#x27;s a spider outside by the door, understanding has been achieved - that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important. We are all just trying to understand each other.<p>Maybe children have an advantage because they <i>aren&#x27;t able</i> to talk properly when they are young due to physical growth limits, so we make a lot of effort to teach them.<p>It takes children 5 <i>year</i> to reach 95% - 100% language fluency, and will go on to learn many new words over the next 15 years, and some will go on to study their mother tongue, read, and learn more about their and, other languages, all their lives.<p><i>By 5 years of age, anyone (including unfamiliar listeners) should be able to understand the child’s speech in conversation 95-100% of the time.</i>[1]<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet $100 dollars <i>anyone</i> in full language immersion will reach at least that stage of fluency in 5 years. And remember, children can be very talkative, so they&#x27;re always making mistakes and learning.<p>I guess adult language learning is how it is because adults are generally too busy to make that sort of commitment. It then follows as self evident that children and adults learn languages differently. Adults solution space is constrained. We have to try to learn a language around busy adult lives.<p>Children&#x27;s brains are also still developing, so there&#x27;s going to be some physical differences also, it&#x27;s not clear whether that should be an advantage or disadvantage. Maybe being able to map a second language to what you already know is an advantage, we already have a framework.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.speechpathologyaustralia.org.au/library/2013Factsheets/Factsheet_Sound_of_Speech_PreschoolSchool-aged_children.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speechpathologyaustralia.org.au/library/2013Facts...</a>",1450944362

2691843,comment,2690472,2691688,1,0,trezor,,,"Really. Mentioning model number wouldn't really be much use, but here is what I have now: A Dell Studio XPS Laptop with 256GB SSD, 4GB ram, 2.4GHz Core i5 dual-core CPU, 15.6"" 1920x1080 LED display, built-in bluetooth, 802.11n wifi and the <i>very important</i> 3G module.<p>The MBP offer I got for a 70% higher price was: 128GB SSD, 4GB ram, 2.4GHz Core2 Duo CPU, a sub-HD LCD display. For full HD I had to go almost up to an almost 20"" ""laptop"". Wth. And it still wouldn't be a LED-screen. Built-in 3G module is not an option and I would be forced to carry around a stupid dongle for internet access. Screw that.<p>Anyway: The MBP has 1. better casing, 2. an inferior last-gen CPU, 3. an inferior capacity drive, 4. no built-in 3G option, 5. an inferior low-contrast, low-DPI screen. And it costs 70% more. I'm not paying that much for better casing and ability to run OSX in a supported state. No way.<p>* The current MBP lineup now may be different but that was what I was offered when I went out shopping and ended up with this laptop. The price difference is very, very clear. The MBP is only an option for those already bitten by Mac-addiction.<p>Just to be upfront about the prices offered: The Dell-option just below 14000 NOK (Google it). The Apple-option: slightly above 23000 NOK. Not even a real question at that point.",1308916616

Mine are in my pocket until I am at the door (actually, most of my doors are RF or keypad, I use very few metal keys).<p>This is really nothing new thought if you have studied locks at all.  All the common keylocks (eg: standard house locks, most vehicles, etc.) have a fixed/known set of tumblers, and a fixed/known set of pin codes.  When I was more interested in physical lock mechanisms about 18 years ago I had the GM tumbler height elevations pretty well memorized, plus a good stock of blanks and templates.  I could look at most GM keys, ""read"" the code (like 5,4,4,3,1) and then go off and make a key that would work 90% of the time.  Same thing for Ford locks.  It was fun to move a friends vehicle in the high school parking lot, but the novelty wore off quickly.  This article seems to be the same thing, except rather than having to say something like ""cool keychain, can I see it?"", you have to take a high-res pic of their key from 300 feet.",1308914230

2691754,comment,2690700,2690700,1,0,Brewer,,,"I've just read through the replies here and I thought that maybe I'd throw in my two cents. First off, I do not have a 95% average. In fact, I failed 3 out of 5 courses last semester. I had piled Calculus I, Linear Algebra I, and Microeconomics into the same semester and apparently I wasn't ready to take all of those at one time.<p>Realizing that my GPA was so bad (1.63 as of now) got me pretty depressed. I started Googling how I could fix my GPA and how I could become a better student. I came across a site called StudyHacks (<a href=""http://calnewport.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calnewport.com/blog/</a>) that had a lot of great articles that were enjoyable to read. I'm going to go to the library in the next week or so and get Cal's book ""How to Become a Straight-A Student"" (I'd do it now, but I'm reading The Pragmatic Programmer) and I hope that the book will make things more clear.<p>In the coming year there are a few changes I want to make. The biggest once, contrary to what others on here have said, is that I want to become organized. I've always been the type of person to enjoy what I'll call ""organized chaos"". There is a place for everything, and that place is wherever it happens to be. That has to change.<p>The next thing I want to change is that I'm actually going to work on my problem sets. It's been mentioned that problem sets are usually only worth 10 or 15 percent of your final mark. What I find is that while they aren't worth much, not doing your problem sets will affect your test grades in a negative way. Not only are problem sets a grade, they are the best practice that you can get.<p>The last thing that I want to do is to get involved around my university. We have a CS society that, I'm sad to say, doesn't do much more than drink (not that drinking is a bad thing). I want to get involved with the society, generate new members, and help get the society more active. I have a few ideas that I'm going to bring up with some of the society ""executives"" that I hope they will like as much as I do.<p>Obviously I don't have a 95% average, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. I hope it will work for me though. And I think that is the biggest thing there is to consider. Just because something worked for someone else, doesn't mean that it will work for you. Try out different things and see what you like.",1308913692

4769613,comment,4768631,4769475,4,0,chao-,,,"The maker-bot style, plastic printers are not the only printers out there. For example, I know that the current Z-Corp printers create figures out of a sort of powder and literally use inkjet ink to put the full spectrum of color you would expect right into the surface of the model as it is made (it can get to be a millimeter or so deep, so it doesn't just scratch off). Although you do have to coat it in a lacquer/sealant to strengthen the model post-print. I wonder how the Japanese machine accomplishes this, or if it even needs to?<p>My experience comes from some work I did for a startup that has such a machine, and uses it for similar purposes (human figures).

What were they thinking?<p>The math is the easy part here. All the rest is hard.<p>How can you reach as many people as possible? How can you make sure that you reach a random sample of people? If you give up on that because its pretty hopeless, how can you make sure that the characteristics you pick to build your sample (for example age, gender, race, etc.) actually matter, are correctly chosen and that you have the right information about how your sample should look when it comes to those characteristics? (This problem can be rephrased as: How do you make sure your sample is representative? It is, however, important to unpack the complexity involved in that.)

While I agree that other people might be overestimating the importance of Linus's opinion on desktop Linux, I believe he's less likely to be wrong about these things than a whole bunch of people. It's not the same as with ""rocket ships, film production, oil recovery techniques"", because he has a lot more to do with Linux in general than those other topics.<p>Yes, it's important not to jump on a bandwagon, but that goes both ways: it seems to be increasingly fashionable to attack ""celebrities"" in our field through thinly veiled ad hominems.

I'll pay attention to his opinions and try to extract facts from them, in order to form my own. I understand that the author is frustrated with people who don't do that, but dissing Linus is not the way to rectify the situation.<p>In the end, I don't care <i>what</i> Linus uses on his computer as much as <i>why</i> he uses (or refuses to use) it and how that might applied in general.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://brooklynhacker.com/post/35445721578/that-moment-when-rms-walks-into-your-hackathon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brooklynhacker.com/post/35445721578/that-moment-when-...</a>",1352644968

If you ask most users to turn off a security feature so that they can run your software, they're going to think you're doing something shady.<p>And that's pretty shitty. Now a lot of people will say ""it's only $99/year; what's the big deal?""<p>Well, first off, that's $99/year, forever, or your apps stop working. That's quite a commitment for a small developer.<p>Secondly, $99 is steep if you're developing <i>freeware</i>. You should not have to pay a hundred bucks a year for the privilege of giving your software away without people thinking that you're trying to steal credit card numbers or something.<p>Finally, $99 is steep for a lot of young people. I started developing freeware and shareware when I was in high school. If I had had to pay $99/year to make my app presentable, it probably would have been a deal stopper.<p>Now, you might say ""Sure, but you're an established shareware developer and none of these things apply to you."" But they still <i>affect</i> every shareware developer. Ever notice that nobody seems to be have been successful with shareware on Windows in many many years? Everything on that platform has been ""free trials"" and sketchy ad ware. The difference is <i>ecosystem</i>.<p>For many years, there was a thriving freeware and shareware ecosystem for the Mac, and so Mac users <i>expected</i> to be able to find freeware and shareware solutions to their problems. They expected to be able to find a handful of cheap or free programs that did what they wanted, and they'd be able to try out each one until they found one they liked. They expected this because it was true.<p>And free/shareware developers <i>expected</i> there to be an audience of Mac users looking for a free/shareware app that did what their app did. And they could be reasonably sure that if they fulfilled a real need, did it well, and kept the latest versions up on software aggregators, they'd be able to reach that audience.<p>But those three points above, along with the decimation of aggregators, and the introduction of the Mac App Store have broken that ecosystem. And let's be clear: Apple didn't merely sit by while the forest burned. They <i>clear cut</i> the damned thing and built their app store there. That thriving ecosystem had helped Apple sell computers, but it didn't profit them directly. So Apple set out to <i>change</i> users' expectations away from ""find some cheap/free software out there written by a small developer"" to ""check the App Store"", all so that they could squeeze 30% out of the process.<p>I do not think Gatekeeper is really about security. I think it is about turning the Mac App Store into the Only Way to release software. It's just a little squirt of agent orange to make sure that the forest doesn't grow back.",1352644746

Could you spell out the details of your comment a bit more, and perhaps touch on the approach which Wolfram argues for?<p>* * *<p>Offloading computation only works when you understand what the computations are and why we do them. That's something that must be learned, it's not knowledge that springs fully formed into our minds as soon as we step into a classroom.<p>Carrying out computations thus gives us explicit and implicit knowledge of how the things we may eventually automate actually work. But it's also valuable because it trains us to compute in a precise and effective mannera capability that remains useful later on. For instance, in logic it's often important to be able to carry out syntactic manipulations (e.g. into normal forms) in one's head, or even tacitly.<p>I'm sure there are plenty of examples from other areas of mathematics where computation is important, it's just that we do it so automatically that we don't think about it. Often I've found that students have trouble following proofs that take logically and computationally innocent steps without saying what's going on. Here I don't mean things like applying AC in the background, but just simple tricks like de Morgan's laws or taking the contrapositive. They have difficulty because they haven't taken those steps often enough themselves to have internalised them.",1352644340

4769528,comment,4769216,4769401,16,0,flebron,,,"As a teacher, the reason I teach with formality before allowing students to be informal, is that formality is training wheels.<p>Initially, the students do not know how to write a coherent proof. That is why we give them formal tools such as induction, and require them to write clearly, detailing their steps. When we do not do this, we see catastrophic lack of logical and coherent thought. Sometimes, this is the result of them not being able to _write_ their thoughts coherently, but more often, it is a results of their thoughts not _being_ coherent in the first place. Formality is used, partly, as forced coherency in writing, in an attempt to induce coherency in thought.<p>Once the students are able to write coherent proofs, sure, let them ride fast, let them ""freestyle"" proofs, with the confidence that what they're writing is what they intend to write, and with the skill to communicate concisely, clearly and unambiguously with informal language. If they can do it, more power to them. Often times, however, they need a lot of time with the training wheels, before they can ride fast and not fall disastrously.",1352643577

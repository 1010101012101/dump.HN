I don't see a reason to assume that GMO crops present ""more"" hidden risks -- since by definition any such risks are hidden in both the GMO and non-GMO cases -- and you certainly haven't provided any such reasons in your post.

Let's say Apple sold 30% of all smartphones in a quarter. Now, from an investor standpoint that may seem pretty bad. However, Apple has a much higher profit margin, so what's actually relevant to investors and shareholders from a strict, short-term ROI basis is the share of the total revenue and the share of the total profit. As it turns out, Apple's share of the smartphone market's revenue is around 80%, so even if they dipped down to 30% of all smartphone handsets sold they would still have about half of the revenue.",1357358224

5011486,comment,5010900,5011277,4,0,Deejahll,,,"Wow, I hate this advice.<p>OP, if you are, like I was, completely repulsed by the constant insistence from everyone that you should go to college so you can toke, drink, party, and fuck: take heart, you can get a lot out of college without ever associating with meatheads and frat houses. The idiot carnival is not as prevalent as popular culture would have you believe; you can invest yourself into a hugely rewarding intellectual field, have excellent roommates that don't make you shove strange objects up your ass, and never even learn the name of your school's sports team, if that's more your style.<p>Also: though it is certainly <i>easy</i> to do all of those things while racking up student loans or mooching the monetary equivalent of a new car off your parents, the implication that you <i>can't</i> do most of those things without (or after) college is simply wrong. I feel much more able to ""do whatever I want"" now that I'm out of college and successfully making money for a few years.<p>I think college is important for the fundamentals it provides: data structures, mathematics, a vocabulary that helps you reason about (programming) problems. Exposure to concepts that you wouldn't otherwise know are useful. I met my wife in college too. But at the same time there's a lot that I think was both unavoidable and completely wasteful.<p>On balance, I feel like I got a lot out of it, and I'm glad that I didn't let the people whose college experience was mainly about sex dissuade me from going. It is what you make of it.",1357357893

5011449,comment,5011296,5011296,3,0,RuggeroAltair,,,"I understand what you are trying to say, but this article is silly from many points of view. I don't want to answer with wise-ass comments like ""you went to the wrong college"" and such, so I'll give you a couple of arguments:<p>- College isn't only CS.<p>- Pure (computer or not) science isn't 'working for someone'. It's 'learning how to do (computer) science correctly', hopefully.<p>- Plagiarism is not what you are saying, which is superficial. Citing a paper and using previous work in academia isn't plagiarism, for example. Copying someone else's paper and putting your name on it is. Which IS bad. I can't take a linux distribution and tell the world I wrote it. But I can use it and (depending on the license) sell it. Or make something else with it and add my name on it.<p>- Performance matters or not depending on the users, obviously. But if you don't know that your algorithms are bad, or if you don't know how to fix them when you hit scaling problems, then what do you do with all your users? Sure, you can hire someone who went to college or learned that somewhere else, but then you'd be supporting the idea that there is no need to be technical to be founders, which is partly true but if google and others taught us something is that the technical founders tend to be able to understand some problems better (and solve them better).<p>- Learning the concepts behind the list you wrote isn't incompatible with college. If you take some business classes you can learn a lot of it. No one is forcing you not to take those classes or a major in CS and a minor in Economics.<p>- From college you don't get only the classes, but also the interaction with a lot of smart people, diversity, challenge and many other things. It changes you, hopefully in better.<p>- Getting excited about being entrepreneurs doesn't always mean the sooner the better. It depends if one is ready. Like with startup ideas, arriving too early may be as bad as arriving late. So, if you quit college for the sake of being an entrepreneur when you are 19 and then you fail, you lost the chance of getting 'more' ready through college.<p>- Same applies for grad school. You might not need to go to grad school to do anything. But a lot of people change the way they see the world going to grad school, which, if it made you wiser, could be a good quality to have when founding a startup (plus the extra knowledge).<p>All this to say that if you think that you can say ""all this does is this"" I think you might want to rethink a little bit, since it's rare that such absolutists ideas about things so controversial are ever correct.",1357357274

I've not had a chance to watch it yet, but it's got action and is apparently quite good.<p>Another excellent action K-drama is <i>City Hunter</i> (2011), which is actually based on a late 80s/early 90s anime series, and has a corresponding anime as well that was first released in 1987. <i>City Hunter</i> was probably one of the first K-dramas where the production values and special effects <i>really</i> struck me in the face. Things have only continued to improve since then. Unfortunately, most J-drama producers haven't opted to continually increase production values in the same manner (and the Japanese wonder why K-dramas are so popular in Japan).<p>Another good K-drama in the last year (which I've seen) was <i>Ghost</i>, which (while it has some action) is more about crime and computers/hacking, but since you're on HN, you might like it. It had a surprisingly realistic portrayal of computers/hacking - not your usual CSI crap. Plus, the lead actress, Lee Yeon Hee, while still rather young/inexperienced in terms of acting, is one of the most beautiful (in a uniquely understated way) I've seen in K-dramaland in quite a while.<p>I certainly enjoy melodramas as well though, especially the makjang dramas[0] that Korea is famous for. <i>Nice Guy</i> (2012) is a thrilling example of this, and one of the best K-dramas overall from last year. And if you're interested in historical dramas, I hear <i>Arang and the Magistrate</i> is quite nice.<p>Dramabeans[1] is a good (and surprisingly professional) blog for keeping abreast of K-drama news in general. They have good year-end roundups[2] that allow you to quickly spot the good shows.<p>> The most recent one I really enjoyed was Steins;Gate which is really quite brilliant!<p>Yes, <i>Steins;Gate</i> has been a notable exception - I've been meaning to play the visual novel the anime is based on, but that would require me to boot into Windows :/<p>> Also I'm jealous you're able to read Japanese, I've not had the discipline to really learn it yet.<p>Learning how to read/write Japanese is all about making it fun. I used the standard RtK/Anki approach, but what really motivated me was using a brush instead of a normal pencil/pen. It really improves your handwriting and makes practicing a lot more fun. Once you've got all the jouyou kanji down, it's just a matter of picking up jukugo in context, which is inherently a lot more fun, if you can find interesting stuff to read and make Anki flashcards out of. I started out with lines from dramas (there are Japanese subtitles available on D-Addicts[3]), and then moved onto websites, before going to actual novels.<p>0: <a href=""http://belectricground.com/2011/04/11/korean-language-and-culture-series-makjang/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://belectricground.com/2011/04/11/korean-language-and-cu...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://www.dramabeans.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dramabeans.com/</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.dramabeans.com/tag/year-in-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dramabeans.com/tag/year-in-review/</a><p>3: <a href=""http://d-addicts.com/forum/subtitles.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d-addicts.com/forum/subtitles.php</a>",1357357095

A first one is that many of the distinctions introduced (such as proc,fun,gen) are all optimization issues.

The language may force the developer way too early in the process to think of things that do not matter at that point. In the best case, it will matter later on, when the program truly works. Another issue I have is that the ""simplifications"" introduced initially lead to introducing lots and lots of additional symbols such $ and #, just because the simplification was apparently not leading to something simple.

I think a lot of that's been damaged by seeing bad CGI in films. One disturbing thing I've noticed is that before widespread CGI, animator's sense of physics seemed to be getting better as animation technique developed. Now, it seems to be getting worse.<p>This hoax was supposed to be ""good"" CG:

When birds of prey snatch something off the ground, they are relying on having enough momentum, such that after the snatch, they still have forward motion to maintain airspeed. The portrayed bird in the video <i>doesn't have any forward motion</i> just after the snatch. No forward motion means no lift. There's nothing holding it up. The flapping wings are horizontally oriented and flapping vertically, so they're primarily thrusting forwards. (Birds with little to no forward motion can flap their wings to thrust away from the ground, but then their wings are oriented vertically, and the flapping is horizontal.) I can only assume the animators think ""levitation rays"" come off the bottom of the wings.<p>That's egregious, but it's what passes for ""good"" CG nowadays.

After two semesters, I couldn't take how boring it was. Over the years in college, I found very few people who were actual developers. I met a senior level developer playing starcraft who I became really good buddies with and got a lot of insight to what it's really like to be a developer and how (for the MOST part depending on the company) little a degree actually mattered if you were going for a dev position somewhere.<p>My buddy knew that I was looking to get into programming and would tap at the idea from time to time. Finally, I got the balls to start playing around with javascript. Shortly after, he informed me his friend's friends were looking for someone to train (completely green to software development) to write software for their consulting company. I did the interview with them, landed the job and shortly I began to realizing how much I loved programming. When they said ""train"", they meant they'd buy me books and would pay me to read them.<p>I got to the point where I was in my Bio classes and it would drive me insane that I wasn't learning something about the software world. I began to skip classes, skip homework and eventually dropped out. (I do have my Associates in Computer Science, but not a BA). 10 months later I'm able to handle small yet fairly complex projects they throw at me and am familiar with several .NET frameworks. I've been able to familiarize myself with certain ways to Unit Test my code, I'm familiar with WCF, WPF, C#, MVVM, OOP concepts and a handful of other amazing things.<p>Now to make my point. Being completely new to all of this I felt I needed to go to school to get any type of job. Being surrounded by software developers who've had their own startups, consulting companies or do hiring at their company for developers, I've heard the same thing repeatedly ""I don't give a shit if you have a degree or not. If you know what you're talking about I'm going to hire you. I've interviewed countless people with degrees who can't write code.""<p>Moral of all of this. Be good at what you do.

It's the default way that's shown, but doesn't allow for too much growth.  It's one of those 'default' things that you see everyone doing because it's what's promoted, but it's not really a great practice - having a separate service method that can rebuild initial or sample data (which can also be invoked from other locations, not just the bootstrap) would be preferable.

However, I think it is a fair assessment to say that doing so is incredibly discouraging; while I don't have ""numbers"" to back it up, I definitely have tons of anecdotes on this.<p>On my own side, I can say this: I actually have code right now in Android; however, there is probably no chance that I will ever bother submitting another patch again.<p>What, in my experience, happens is that you submit a patch, and one person looks at it, thinks it is great, and gives it a +1. However, he can't merge it until someone agrees. Only, there isn't enough involvement on Google's end to get two people to agree. It isn't like someone else disagrees: you just don't get two peoples' opinions on the patch.<p><a href=""https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/7288/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/7288/</a><p>That is a patch that I submitted in January of 2009. Apparently, in May of 2010, a second person agreed, and the patch was merged. Yes: 16 months later.

he wanted justification for why I wanted the feature. Two months later, the patch died, as I had long moved on. Now, had that question come, I dunno, a year earlier? (So, a mere 4 months after I submitted it), maybe I'd have remembered whether or not it was required for my use case. ;P<p><a href=""https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/14339/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/14339/</a><p>This patch wasn't even mine, but somehow I ended up in the system as ""maybe he'll be second reviewer this time!"" (and no, I have no clue how or why or what the rules are).<p>Only, this was the most depressing of all: when I reviewed the patch, I determined that the original code actually had a buffer overflow in it... this was an <i>important</i> patch.<p>The patch, of course, had already been in the system for a while: it was submitted in April, but it wasn't until nearly two months later that I got poked to review it. But, I don't think I actually could be ""second reviewer"", so there just ended up being a bunch of +1s from random people until yet another month went by; it finally got merged.<p>Another half of the problem is the same thing people here are complaining about: that AOSP is really just ""an occasionally merged external branch"" to ""the real code"".<p>The result is that when you are working on a patch, you actually can't know whether you are working on code that even exists anymore in the upstream branch. Maybe the code exists, but doesn't have the bug anymore; or maybe it does, but the implementation is sufficiently different that your code no longer merges against it.<p>What this means is that even if someone reviewed your patch instantly, it already might not apply anymore, and if it doesn't it isn't like they can even ask you to fix it.<p>It used to be that Google was promising that they'd merge the internal and AOSP branches, so they'd be working in public on nearly the same codebase (closer to Chromium). However, that promise at some point dissolved so greatly that they simply <i>closed the source</i> for something like eight months, not even attempting to merge it.<p>Why? As far as I can tell (and I've stared at this a lot), it was to hobble Amazon slightly, who had just announced that they were working on a tablet based on Android. Not just ""an Android tablet"", but ""we are going to use all of that valuable work you did, but not pay you anything for it because we don't need your first-party Google apps"".<p>The code didn't become open again until Amazon started shipping their tablets to users. At which point, the story with the open source codebase changed a lot. Now, the promise is more ""we will make certain our preferred partners get access to the codebase quickly"", but otherwise the code doesn't get dropped until the product ships.<p>Due to this, when we received our Android 4.0 test devices at Google I/O, and I soon there-after found a bug in libdl (broken shared object initializers), I was largely screwed. I seriously wasted a week (successfully!) figuring out what caused the bug and reverse-engineering what they changed using a disassembler, so I could file a bug.<p>When I managed to get the bug filed to the mailing list was about when the code finally dropped, so maybe that week was just wasted, but maybe I needed that time to find it anyway. Of course, Android 4.0 shipped with that bug. The issue was fixed in Android 4.0.1, and ""luckily"" almost no one upgraded to Android 4.0 until Android 4.0.2, but... frowny. :(",1357354842

And on the whole, it's definitely one of the better anime in recent years. Unfortunately, there has been a strong trend these days to go for the mo/fanservice crap, likely in an attempt to drive DVD/Bluray sales among the hardcore otaku in the face of declining mainstream viewers and ad revenues. I think I lost my patience somewhere around when <i>Highschool of the Dead</i> came out.<p>Nowadays I watch a lot more K-dramas, which have rapidly picked up in cinematography and acting over the last few years - they are definitely in a Golden Era right now, and the internet makes it so easy to rapidly obtain them, no matter where you are living. The K-drama fansubbing community is absolutely amazing, and it has been a TON of fun learning Korean through Japanese and seeing the similarities (and differences) between the languages.<p>But there's so much good anime from back in the day that doesn't get enough attention. <i>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</i> particularly stands out in my mind as a wonderful OVA (though it is quite atypical among OVAs, at 110 episodes). The use of a space opera setting as a backdrop for political commentary was very poignantly done. I've been meaning to read the novels the series is based on, but as science fiction novels are wont to do, they will no doubt be chock full of vocabulary that will probably require me to break out my Japanese-English dictionary.",1357354821

2680389,comment,2679041,2679041,1,0,GrooveStomp,,,"I suspect that Scala is good, but I find the article a little disingenuous.  In one example, the author counts curly braces on a line as part of the line count (when it happens in Java code), but doesn't do the same when it happens for Scala code.  The constraint example leaves out the public method declaration, or at least doesn't illustrate how it directly maps to the Java code.  Maybe it directly replaces everything there, but both snippets don't provide enough context to decide - at least not without already understanding a fair bit of Scala and Java code.

Here I see someone arguing how it eases up cycling through the array, ""a frequent operation"". How is looping through an array or accessing its last element for a frequent operation?<p>In every non-computer related document one will found ordinal numbers starting from 1 and n-element sets with the number of the last element being n. Now thanks to the zero-based indexing one has to always switch back and forth between two ways of counting things, depending if one writes/reads code or prose. Just pay attention over the next week or month how many times you forget to make the switch and make this kind of off-by-one mistake I'm talking about. I admire mathematics more then any other discipline and I do see the benefits of a formal approach, but here the formalism has in my opinion clearly diverged from any kind of common sense and from actual software engineering practice.<p>In fact in any engineering discipline, if you study its history, communication errors are the most frequent reason for failure or even for disaster. Having to always translate every document to the private language of your discipline certainly doesn't help communication. Dijkstra mostly did proofs and didn't have to deal with other people too much in his work, so perhaps he didn't understand that.",1308689535

Having the next tab's close button typically not land under the pointer prevents this from happening most of the time, but I'm glad they put some thought into this and enforced a delay before the second click would close the tab.<p>My guess is that there are more people accidentally closing extra tabs than people who want to close a lot of tabs they haven't seen in a while.",1308687889

Why in the age of the internet, we're stuck in a relatively ancient publishing system.*<p>If you're talking about ""why do we have publishers?"", then that is a question that you can search HN for, as we often have this discussion about IEEE/ACM. I'm strongly against <i>publishers</i> but not the system of <i>publishing</i>, because we need those peer-review systems.<p>* The gap between popular science and scientific research.*<p>There are multiple factors at work here.<p>1. Often, researchers are working on something that <i>just can't be sold as popular science.</i> That's why we call them researchers. Particularly in Computer Science, a lot of what you could call ""popular science"" really means ""shipping products."" If it's cool enough, it's cool enough to sell it.<p>2. Many, many universities are very poor at selling research. Exceedingly so. The schools you hear about all the time; MIT, Stanford, etc. are those which can afford big, able PR departments. These guys are also not interested in necessarily selling the facts. MIT are particularly guilty of this, often writing articles like ""MIT researchers change the fundamentals of all AI"" when its this little incremental step, that, while important, has not set the world on fire and comes with lots of caveats.<p>Popularizing science is not what researchers should be doing. There's this really terrible blame game that happens right now, where it's en vogue to blame scientists and just add more things to their job role. In a university, we're expecting them to: teach, find money for research, perform research, write papers and advise undergraduate/graduate students. Oh, and now they should be responsible for performing scientific outreach, otherwise they're all insular and elitist. That's why companies like Google and Microsoft are becoming so attractive, you get to <i>just do research</i>. That's what your trained for, that's what your career is.<p>If we want to worry about popularizing science and encouraging STEM takeup in young people and all this stuff that we keep hearing about, then you're going to have to <i>hire people to do it</i>. The NSF can start putting money in grants that are ring-fenced to funding a PR department that actually goes and does this stuff. Universities already take 50% out of all research grants anyway, putting them towards library fees and such. Expecting researchers to do it all is becoming more and more untenable.",1308687427

She had a non-life threatening but potentially dangerous condition. She went to the hospital and was treated. During the period of time between jobs she had purchased a temporary health insurance policy. That policy declined to pay for the treatment. The hospital presented us with a couple of options, renegotiate the bill, accept some charity, etc. We chose to fight the insurance company and ultimately had them pay it (because it was a valid claim). But one of our options always hovering around was bankruptcy. Do you want to do that? Of course not. We would have rather cleaned out our savings and maxed out the credit cards before doing that, but it was an option.<p>So there is an obvious path here, get a temporary policy and use the card to get into the hospital. You will probably get denied by the insurance company for a pre-existing condition, but you can then declare bankruptcy.<p>Now, that is a pretty terrible way to go about it and speaks of how screwed our system is. But I would say bankruptcy is preferable to prison. And since there is that path available, I would think that this guy is mostly an activist.

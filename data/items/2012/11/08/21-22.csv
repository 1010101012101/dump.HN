""Getting things done"" is a hugely valuable skill, but don't conflate having that skill with meaning you are too busy to code clean. Productivity and beautiful code are not mutually exclusive.<p>I write very nice, commented JavaScript that employs consistent whitespace and indentation and validates in JSLint all day long. That's just how I do it and I'm way faster than the coworkers of mine who code things quick and dirty.<p>You reach a certain level of expertise and your code will just naturally have these qualities. It will be both beautiful and will be developed quickly. Senior talent gets this. Junior talent doesn't.<p>This was a thought provoking article though. The main takeaway is that ""getting things done"" is the most important skill a programmer can have which I completely agree with. For the sake of other developer's sanity, clean code is so important too. Ugly, sloppy code takes longer to read, more effort to maintain and is frankly demoralizing and tiresome to work with. Clean code for me is probably right underneath getting things done on a skills ranking. Ideally, good developers would have both...and my experience shows that good developers do.",1352411548

4759974,comment,4759667,4759667,59,0,hluska,,,"This article terrifies me....<p>About four years ago (when I had just turned 31), I started  working at a local startup. It was the typical startup gig with huge hours and even bigger responsibility. Being somewhat dysfunctional, I began living the worst possible life. I was working huge hours, so I decided that it didn't make sense to cook. Consequently, I started eating out at least two meals a day.  And, since I was working too many hours to cook, I couldn't justify going to the gym. Heck, why work out if you don't have enough time to cook???<p>Within a year, my body decided to rebel. I started getting weird symptoms - my chest often felt hollow, I'd get weird pains across the tops of my shoulders and through my neck, and occasionally, I would have to stop while walking up a flight of stairs. It wasn't because I was out of breathe, rather, it was because my head would start to spin and I was afraid that I'd fall.<p>Being stubborn, I put off going to the doctor. But, eventually, I started having bigger symptoms and I had to go. My blood pressure was extremely high. So high that my doctor took two readings, then took me into another office to try a different machine. I'll never forget that conversation:<p>- ""Greg, your blood pressure is very high.""\n- ""How high?""\n- ""High enough that if you keep doing what you're doing, you will have a stroke.""<p>Hearing the word 'stroke' when you are 32 years old is a pretty big shock to the system. So, I made some changes. I went back to the gym. I started cooking. I cut my salt intake drastically. Things settled down...<p>But, as they often do, stress started creeping back into my life and my habits started to slip. My attendance at the gym started to drop off. My eating habits started to slip.<p>Things culminated one horrifying morning, when I was sitting at my desk at work and things went....well, uh...things went. Half of my body went totally numb. I looked at my computer and, even though I knew it was a computer, I could not, for the life of me, remember what the heck it was called.<p>There I was...33 years old and I saw a computer in front of me. I knew what it was for. I knew what I could do with it. But I could not, for the life of me, remember that it was called a computer. I'll never forget the sheer terror of that moment.<p>My company's Biz Dev guy rushed me to the hospital, where I got to experience a full battery of tests. Thankfully, it wasn't a stroke, but it was freakishly close. I am a touch claustrophobic so they were afraid that a CT scan would elevate my blood pressure, so they drugged me. The combination of extreme fear and a heavy dose of Ativan was unlike anything I have ever experienced. When I'm afraid of things, I like to intellectualize. I like neuroscience a whole lot, so, until the Ativan kicked in, I was rapidly going through my symptoms and trying to localize them to a region of my brain. Once the Ativan kicked in, I knew that I should likely do, uh, something, but uh, yeah, oh wow, this is, uh, pretty relaxing and.....<p>Long story short, I did not have a stroke. Rather, my blood pressure went through the roof and my body decided to flip the reset button. I took blood pressure medication for awhile and, with my doctor's help, eventually got off of it.<p>Now, I live differently, but I still see my inner demon trying to make me sick again. The old habits - working too much, exercising too little, and eating out a little too often - still rear their head. But, this time, I know that if I don't take care of myself, I might end up in the hospital again.<p>Sorry for writing so much, but I wanted to share my story. We are involved in a very stressful industry and, though I don't know many of you, I care about all of you. Please be healthy.",1352410540

They have something similar, focused on enterprise customers. I find this subject very interesting.<p>I am a Ruby guy and I only marginally get in contact with their C++ code, but from what I learned so far this stuff is extremely memory and CPU hungry. It also depends on having been fed the right amounts of input. That's why Google Translate is so good. They have tons and tons of data from all the websites they parse, and in many cases the content can be obtained in different languages. Corporate pages are often translated paragraph by paragraph by humans which results in perfect raw data to train these algorithms. Also for example all documents that the European Parliament produces are translated into the languages of all member states.<p>Everything that has to do with translation has to do with context. I think the software right now is as smart as a six year old kid, except that it has a much bigger vocabulary. But if you say ""The process has stalled. Let's kill it."" it probably only makes sense if you know you are talking about computers.<p>It's hard to imagine that computers one day might really understand everything we say.

I absolutely, positively know that.<p>But I'm saying, when you're measuring quality objectively, it just doesn't matter. What matters is the thing itself. The created object. The outcome.<p>I'm not simply incorrectI'm simply correct. My argument has the constraint of simplicity. It is defining the basic existence of a thing which we know exists, namely Quality. When you add complexity, yes, the definition is no longer sufficient to describe the entire process; but I'm not claiming that perfect code and perfect coders are possible in reality. I'm saying: start with simple and true definitions so you understand what quality <i>is</i> by itself, so that once you add situations and reality to it you can still try to achieve something close to ""good."" It is a matter of scope.<p>This isn't an argument. Quality exists. Defining it is hard, yes, but it's not impossible to understand that one thing can be better than another by many measures, and we say that thing has higher Quality.<p>Read ""Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"" it'll twist your brain up some more.<p>What you're going to say next is of course that you're right and that devolving into silly philosophical arguments doesn't mean anything to real-world work, so yes, I guess I'll agree with that.",1352410352

People in poverty in America by race \n~24 mil white \n~11 mil black \n~14 mil hispanic\nI cannot and will not believe that in 2012 we have structural racism in America, the day after a black man named Barack Hussein Obama got elected to his second term as President of the United States. Is their racism? Yes. Is it structural and 100% pervasive? No.<p>The reason they have less opportunities is a structural problem, but it is not because of racism. Maybe it grew out of that, and it probably did, but at some point when they stopped you have to change yourself. The problem is lack of a family structure. The stats of black single mothers living in poverty vs. other races is unbelievable. We have to get fathers back to change this dynamic. I suspect racism and the things that caused along the way contributed to this, but now it is just that way because it's been that way. If you can turn this around, you can turn around a lot of communities, get rid of a lot of poverty, and provide as many opportunities as anyone could want for the black community.",1352410264

It also does too much by default, and there's no simple way to tell it <i>not</i> to do some of these things. Pretty much all customization depends on you understanding a bunch of template layouts with embedded elisp and how they all fit together. Ideally, you'd want to be able to toggle various features via Customize or your init file, but o-blog ships with defaults that make this a lot of work.<p>The baked-in Bootstrap integration is also something I could do without. I don't see why an org exporter needs to know anything about layout, truthfully; just export HTML or Markdown of your subtree and let a dedicated static site generator do the work. O-blog really needs to separate its concerns here and set some sane defaults.<p>The solution I settled on is a slightly-tweaked version of the relatively ancient org-jekyll package. I can blog from any org file by setting a :blog: tag on a subtree, and customizing Jekyll is really simple.

Say you bought 1,000 $9.00 parts the system would show $5,000 in cost instead of $9,000, but if you paid $9.26 for the parts it would show $9,250 in cost.<p>The root cause of this error was the IT team had one guy who was crazy smart and had a bucketfull of assumptions about what the problem was that couldn't imagine that the issue was one baked into some of the first code he had written.<p>In a nutshell, this was a reporting package that sat ontop of SAP that was supposed to be actually useable by field managers and guys who turned wrenches so they could keep track of their budgets and spending.   Of course this was needed because SAP had been implemented with very little training and no helpdesk for users.<p>The project had been rolled out twice to the field and just rejected flat out because the numbers didn't match, million had been spent building it and there was a 3rd try before the entire system was scrapped and a few million spent on an off the shelf piece of software.<p>It took a while to find the root cause of the totals being off because I'd always get these great complex explinations as to why the data was off an they had project change orders in to fix it.   Finally I just pulled data to find out what was going on, and saw this weird pattern of the data being off in specific places but it took a day before I had the insight that the same thing was changing $140.00 into $100.00 as $0.79 into $0.75 i.e. the final nonzero digit of any stored value was being rounded down to the either 0 or 5.",1352408607

It's kind of disappointing, really;  It should let you play real notes in conjunction with the patterns in my opinion.<p>The real bug, though, is that the ""key"" setting at the top of the UI that's supposed to update the available set of chords is completely wonky, and rarely does what it's supposed to (what, you wanted B? Let's go with A instead. You chose major? Minor it is!)",1352408433

I've owned a lot of different brands of shirts and one of the ways in which AA has surpassed many other brands is in the number of washes you can get out of a shirt before it looks and feels like it should be replaced. Many cotton shirts end up with a very rough hand after only 5-10 washes. ELS cotton also makes sure that the shirt resists pilling.<p>These days 95% of the time I can be found wearing the AA ""Track Shirt"" in  multiple colors because it's got great color fastness and maintains a smooth hand. I'd say each of my shirts have 20+ washes and don't look much different than the day I bought them.",1352408414

I've done layouts in other markup languages and had a blast, but when I hit HTML and CSS, I just feel generally confused. Again, I hardly ever do web design, so it could just be ignorance on my part, but I still feel CSS could use a makeover instead of incremental changes.",1337237965
3985814,comment,3985192,3985192,3,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"We just sent in our six year-old's Montessori application for first grade next year.  Our suburban public school system has an amazing reputation, and the passing rates for standardized tests are some of the highest in the state.  Sadly, our little Aspie with ADHD issues has already expressed his dread of first grade.  He doesn't want to do ""seatwork"", ""paperwork"", or any of the other drudgery that our local district tells him is ""his job"". [Quotes indicate words used by teachers with the best of intentions.]  I can't figure out the value of this pseudo-rigor.  Maybe I'm unusual in my  autodidactism, but I can't think of anything I know which I (1) find valuable and (2) learned by force.<p>I bought a K'NEX roller coaster kit and helped him put it together.  At first, he didn't grok the pseudo 3D instructions or the way the pieces fit together.  However, after an hour or so, he was rotating our partially assembled segments in his head to compare them to the illustrations.  But, this doesn't count as rigorous seat work.  Oh well.<p>Our school actually does an excellent job of avoiding the binary incentives of No-Child-Left-Behind and attempts to provide somewhat individualized instruction to students.  Ohio has yet to adopt a value-added measurement scheme, and I wonder how our district would fare, especially if achievement was normalized for socio-economic status (the average household income is over $100K, a high number for Ohio).<p>We hope that the Montessori school's motivated teachers can use their freedom from mandated curriculum requirements, standardized testing, etc. to facilitate our son's exploration of what interests him.  I don't care if his education is seen as incomplete, unbalanced, or otherwise non-standard so long as he grows to become a curious, thoughtful, and creative person.  When has someone with these qualities ever failed because he had some perceived weakness in his childhood education?",1337237938

Along with Cinnamon, it's now the main desktop environment for the 3rd largest Linux distro, and the fastest growing one (Mint).<p>BTW, I like what I've seen of the Gnome3 SDK.  It's just the interface that I hate.  I don't understand why all the biggest distros (except for Mint) are moving toward exclusively offering a mobile-like OS for desktop.  I could totally understand a special edition for netbooks, but Unity is now the only interface officialy available for Ubuntu.  It all seems to be part of the dumbing-down of the desktop.  Given that the biggest group of potential Linux users are Windows power users, who love being able to modify every little facet of their desktop OS, I just don't get it.",1337237380

It's pretty obvious that pinterest has no such claim.  That is one such basis.<p>Other such bases include network effects that come with the whole Facebook model (what it is, i.e. social graph) and that in some way it may even be a ""natural monopoly"".  (People completely miss this when comparing it to myspace, which was never a literal, programmatic social graph).<p>Finally, again I don't know where this was five years ago, but credibility and buy-in based on how Facebook rolled out (Harvard, universities, etc...) may have been a factor.<p>Also due to the Facebook model it doesn't make sense for ANYONE to start a profile on a site that doesn't have any profiles on it.  It's all about having friends on there.

Pinterest will not make 1.5Billion in revenue over its whole lifetime, unless the bubble keeps expanding and it gets at a similar amount of cold, hard cash to spend on customer acquisition: the ""Groupon model"".    (Which I consider possible!  See my comment you replied to.  I am definitely not saying that it can't get another investment at a 50 billion dollar valuation and make the people who just invested 200 million very, very happy.

I am saying that, indeed, it depends on it - or will never be able to justify the 1.5billion valuation it just received.)<p>In other words, yes, I am saying that it will not be able to turn the 200 million it just raised into 1.5 billion cash over its whole lifetime, without raising more money.<p>You might disagree with me, but at least I am being direct and not wishy-washy.

The simple algorithm everyone knows, even if they don't know what an algorithm is, is to start with the largest coin and move down, taking as many of each as you can. Thus to make change for 72 cents we: \ntake 2 quarters, leaving us with 22 cents \ntake 2 dimes, leaving us with 2 cents\ntake no nickels\ntake 2 pennies, leaving us with 0 cents and we're done<p>This algorithm as it turns out is only optimal so long as each denomination is at least twice as much as the previous one. So what happens if we have an 18 cent coin? Let's make change for 37 cents. With the simple algorithm we end up with {1 quarter, 1 dime, 2 pennies}. That's four coins. However you can do it with three coins: {2 18 cent pieces, 1 penny}.<p>The algorithm for the case with arbitrary denominations isn't np-complete (it's a fun algorithms question to figure out), but it's way too difficult to be doing in your head all the time.",1337236050

He worked hard for a living, so I don't blame him. Life is hard and somebody needs to put money on the table.<p>Don't be too harsh on your dad. He may have been too tired or fed up with what he did to have energy left to teach you about programming.<p>And on the ""<i>waisted opportunity</i>"" I don't necessarily agree. You probably became a programmer because he was one, and because you had computers around. You started hacking stuff because it was fun, but if you had a father that was a bad teacher and that pushed you in areas you didn't like, then your passion could have faded away, because passion is a fragile thing.",1337234843

Check out xonotic (www.xonotic.org), a heavily modified quake based shooter. They partly implement anti-cheat functionality by more or less shifting tasks from the client side to the server side, making e.g. wallhacks impossible. Also they use encryption for certain packages to prevent them from being tapered with. Aimbots are another thing, but I have yet to see one.

There was a post (I think I saw it on HN but I can't find it now, dangit) that put forth the idea that unlimited data plans were bad for consumers, because then consumers' and providers' interests are unaligned.  Once you pay for an ""unlimited"" plan, it becomes in the network's best interest for you to send as few bits as possible.  Consumers should actually prefer pay-per-use plans, because it means if the network is down, the service provider doesn't get paid.<p>Of course, there are many other variables involved, and obviously everyone has different usage patterns.",1337234446

I take a shower right <i>before</i> I leave, and when I get there I just have to rinse down and change out of my cycling jersey.  The theory behind the pre-ride shower is that body odor is caused by bacteria on your skin, and showering temporarily knocks out enough of your bacteria that it won't cause significant odor during your ride.  (I'm not aware of actual science on this topic, but I've asked a trusted coworker whether I smell after riding into work, and he says I don't.  So there's your anecdotal data point...)  So for me the bike is extremely practical even living in an area that <i>wasn't</i> designed with bicycles in mind.<p>As for humidity, this is in south Florida—if we can manage it here, then we can handle the humidity pretty much anywhere in the US.<p>Now I'm not saying everyone can or should bike a 52-mile round trip to work.  But the point of this article is that this little experimental suburb has 5,500 people within a single square mile; biking or walking is a perfectly reasonable way to traverse such a small area at nearly any level of fitness, especially when you don't have to worry about automotive traffic, and for the few people who can't manage that there's the public transport option.  Even on our hottest days here in south Florida, one can easily bike a mile, fully dressed, without breaking a sweat.",1281076878

He answered without hesitation that you could load the bikes in the car and drive across town to where there was a park with <i>a</i> bike trail.

Saying that the app has crashed is one thing, but if that results in an angry phone call telling them to start it up again -- even if it has just crashed -- I think kids will be less inclined to keep playing that card.""<p>So in other words you do plan to (help parents)  invade kids privacy even when the kids actively don't want their parents to know where they are. The word ""defence"" in that sentence  is pretty revealing - your frame of perception seems to be that of a battle  between kids trying to get away from your app and parents who don't want them to.<p>Your "" kid who want to see how far away their mother is when she's coming to pick them up,"" scenario  doesn't need this feature.<p>""We, like you, hate the idea of abusing trust and privacy.<p>However, children who want their parents to know when they're getting home from soccer practise, or see how far away their mother is when she's coming to pick them up, is quite a different scenario.""<p>Yeah that's why kids can't turn the app off without letting their parents know ;-).<p>""We, like you, hate the idea of abusing trust and privacy.""<p>is very believable, given that feature ;-)<p>I guess it  is all right  (must be a dumb kid who'd accept such a poison pill gift ) as long as there is no sugarcoating involved and everyone (including the kids) knows what they are getting into. The latter (kids knowing what they are getting into is somewhat dubious).<p>Somewhat slimy product in my personal opinion, but hey if it makes money I can't blame you for trying to get some.<p>Next step: Spouse tracking so you know they aren't having an affair on the side. ;-)<p>Next step: Employee tracking so you know how much time they are spending by the watercooler or the coffeeshop or whether they are <i>really</i> attending the tech conference your company sponsored , or even if any two employees are spending time in each other's bedrooms.<p>As I said it must be a dumb person who'd accept this kind of un-switch-offable- without-warning-Big-Brother app on his or her phone. No different from an electronic monitoring device (as mandated by law for  people under house arrest say)  as long as you want to use your phone. The only difference is that it isn't strapped to you.<p>If you could somehow add a breathalyzer to the IPhone you could broadcast the alcohol content in your blood to your parents.

What we do do a lot of is talking to our customers, and the people we've spoken to, generally, haven't been the paranoid types that you describe. Generally they've been very level-headed people, and in speaking to them you can hear how much they care about their kids.<p>One person we spoke to recently, though very concerned for knowing his kids locations, I think has much better data on the actual dangers to his children than most (certainly more than me, and I'd posit more than you). He was a police detective and loved the application because of the piece of mind that it gave him. I think I'm a reasonable judge of character, and in my evaluation, this wasn't a trust issue, it was just an early warning system to know when his family might be in danger.<p>I don't know that we're encouraging paranoia. I think that paranoia will be there no matter what we do. I acknowledge that there's the potential for us to profit from it, but I guess I think you under-estimate parents, and I can see why: I did initially as well.<p>To me, it comes down to this: when we first came up with this idea, I had a lot of the same reservations you do. But, we did our homework. We speak to people all the time about this. And my honest opinion is that parents are not as bad as you think.",1281076267

1580349,comment,1576446,1579974,0,0,grandalf,,,"Interesting thoughts.  I have a few thoughts in reply.  Ill try to be careful not to expand the scope of our discussion too broadly.<p>I'm inclined to disagree that Americans are aware of the awfulness of war.  War is imagined as safe and hygienic, fought with GPS smart bombs and laser guided munitions.  I think that going into Afghanistan/Iraq post-911, most Americans anticipated fewer than 500 American casualties. Gulf War I had about 35 US casualties, as I recall.<p>We are now in a war that has created thousands of US military casualties and many more limbs lost. Soldiers on the ground deal with hidden IEDs that may send shrapnel through the side of their humvee and kill/maim in very small doses, but the suffering grows little by little as the timeframe increases.<p>(Here I'll be very careful to avoid expanding the scope):<p>Winning a war is (by definition) breaking the will of the enemy.  The distaste of the US populace for the horrors of war necessitated the narrative of smart bombs and technologically-driven victory.  The reality of nation building is far less glamorous, and the stress of war often brings out an ugly side of human nature.<p>Suppose the American public sees American soldiers laying waste to journalists, striking deals with the ISI, renditioning captives to Syria, conducting political assassinations, and generally undertaking all of the ugly tradeoffs of a protracted nation building exercise... this isn't exactly the stuff of Top Gun.  A few close up shots of blown off limbs, stories about cruelty, and lack of measurable success may turn the tide of support for the war, thus breaking our will to keep fighting and leading to defeat.<p>All this assumes that the stated goals of the conflict (defeating the Taliban and ushering in an era of tolerance and women's rights in Afghanistan) match the actual goals.<p>What are the actual goals?  The geopolitics of the conflict are ancient, and George Friedman has written about them extensively, and I'm sympathetic to his explanation.<p>Rather than (in the newspeak of our conflict) ""stabilizing"" Afganistan and Iraq, it is the US goal to destabilize them (by preventing the natural accretion of a major local power).<p>So how do you get a populace of comfortable Americans to support a protracted nation building exercise intended to destabilize an entire region?  Simple:  Come up with a good story.  This is, I think, why Wikileaks poses such a threat (and why I think it's so important).  There has been a decades long effort to build the propaganda story behind these wars, and they are necessary for the US's continued domination.<p>I think it follows from this, incidentally, that terrorism (asymmetrical warfare with a focus on symbolic targets) will be an increasing reality for the US as it becomes increasingly impossible to engage in a traditional war with the US due to its power.<p>It's a much broader question whether the actions of the US in Afghanistan and Iraq will decrease terrorism (I think they are bound to increase it).  I also think it's appropriate to question the policy of the US of being involved in the middle east whatsoever.<p>We (as US voters) are all responsible for the totalitarian regimes sponsored by the US and for the loss of life our destabilization effort has caused.  Thus, I think Wikileaks provides a truly valuable resource as it helps weaken the extremely grand story we've been told for decades about US involvement in the middle east.<p>I view the US reliance upon secrecy and propaganda as a <i>very substantial</i> cog in the war machine, and I do not by default consider our middle east involvement remotely moral (thought admittedly I am not prepared to say I consider it all utterly immoral).<p>I realize I've brought in a few other concepts, and you may deem them insufficiently related to warrant reply, but I'd be curious about your thoughts nonetheless.",1281074997

It's not about whether the tech is right or effective, it's about whether we should, as a society, be encouraging this sort of tech and the behaviour that comes with it.

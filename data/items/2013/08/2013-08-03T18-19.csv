As someone with a strong interest in everything neurology/psychology/intelligence/learning/teaching/etc, this is the most accurate description of what is going on.<p>&quot;Incompetence&quot; isn&#x27;t toxic, viewpoint and attitude are. There will always be someone &quot;dumber&quot; than you, and there will always be someone &quot;smarter&quot; than you. Once you realize this and internalize it into your world view, you will come to the same conclusion that book teaches, and that is one of <i>cooperation</i>.<p>Like my parent here alluded to, you didn&#x27;t just point out an answer, you projected your thought process onto another person.  Why do some people get depressed at what seem like tiny insignificant details, while others live happily in the worst of global conditions? The answer is <i>Perspective</i>. The pain/difficulty anyone feels is very much real to <i>them</i>, it is not an objective measurement -- so when you project the idea that a person just <i>couldn&#x27;t have tried very hard</i>, you make the assumption that you know what it&#x27;s like for that person to &#x27;try&#x27; anything in that context.<p>If you look at my own comment history, you&#x27;ll see that I have dealt with the difficulty of explaining myself to others quite a bit, but also that I try to turn it into a productive thought-provoking discussion with a neutral tone and strong points. For example, what I am saying right now is very similar to a direct attack on your ego (and I wouldn&#x27;t blame you if you took it as such), but I try to present my words in such a way that will invoke action from your rational &#x27;executive brain&#x27; long before it hits your emotional &#x27;reptilian brain&#x27;, if that makes any sense?<p>The only real course of action that makes sense <i>is</i> cooperation; any other interpretation would basically implicate that either the world revolves around you, or that everyone is like you, and those ideas should be clearly false to everyone.",1375556275

The money is often spent poorly (frankly, nowadays too much money is spent on &quot;technology&quot;, but I suppose that&#x27;s another discussion). If parents are concerned, they should go to school board meetings, get involved. Obviously this isn&#x27;t a perfect solution. Big school districts like Chicago (in the news recently) are less responsive. But for families living in suburban or rural areas, there&#x27;s no excuse.

6152930,comment,6151500,6151500,38,0,nakedrobot2,,,"Hi, I&#x27;m the photographer who made this image.<p>Thank you for all the attention :-) Let me try to answer some of your questions, in no particular order:<p>1) Here is the original page: <a href=""http://360gigapixels.com/tokyo-tower-panorama-photo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://360gigapixels.com/tokyo-tower-panorama-photo/</a> also here is a youtube screen capture showing a few highlights, if you are feeling lazy ;) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NboCijiLwmI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NboCijiLwmI</a><p>2) it is not 600,000 megapixels. It is 600,000 pixels wide. If you are calculating it as a full sphere, then it&#x27;s 180 gigapixels. But there is a black space on the bottom so we are calling it 150 gigapixels.<p>3) Yes we have censored a few things in the image which might be embarrassing to those people involved. Most of those things would not be embarrassing in other cultures (I think) such as a woman hanging laundry, but Japan is &quot;different&quot;. Per the request of journalists at Asahi Shimbun who published a story about it there, we covered up a few bits in the photo. Oh, and the guy sleeping on the ground? Well that&#x27;s embarrassing anywhere. Poor fellow probably did not expect to be famous on the internet as he lay down on the bench to sleep, fell off the bench, and kept on sleeping. (Side note: apparently in Tokyo it is fully acceptable to sleep it off on the street or in a park - it is a <i>safe</i> place! Well, if you&#x27;re male...)<p>4) Yes you can use your geek powers to uncover the censored bits and there are already screenshots out there. Oh well. I did not actually see the whole image before publishing it. It is just so big :)<p>5) Yes, I used a Canon 7D (best pixel density) and a 400mm L f/5.6 lens, because that lens is great, sharp, and fit in my carryon - can&#x27;t check camera gear on the plane now, can we.<p>6) I used a Clauss Rodeon gigapixel robot to control the camera. It is still a lot of work to set the speed and so on, don&#x27;t think that this is a &quot;set it and forget it&quot; kind of thing. The robot is moving continuously, and the camera is focusing and shooting while moving. This is technologically amazing stuff, but it takes a lot of tweaking to get it to work. In this case I was not completely familiar with the equipment, and I made some mistakes. One section of the image was stitched together from two entire sets of images shot on two different days, in order to get a good alignment.<p>7) panning mode: we use the &quot;original QTVR style&quot; of navigation, which also used in first-person games. This lets you hold the mouse button down and &quot;glide around&quot;. I find this vastly preferable to the click-drag-click-drag-click-drag google style. On touch screens, the movement follows your finger which is more intuitive generally. I&#x27;ve seen a five year old navigate these panoramas on an ipad with no problem. On the PC with a mouse there is not really &quot;one right way&quot;.<p>8) Yes, I also made the &quot;London 320 gigapixel&quot; image, which is larger in terms of pixels, but this one is FAR more interesting in my opinion, and overall much better quality. If you&#x27;re interested in seeing some of my other large images, check these:

6152929,comment,6146446,6148476,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The avclub link makes more errors than I can count, honestly. For one, you don&#x27;t combine the probabilities unless they&#x27;re independent. So for example, the kid losing his knife and the murder being committed by the same kind of knife aren&#x27;t independent, because it&#x27;s plausible that the kid left the knife at his father&#x27;s place and the actual killer used it to commit the murder.<p>The next problem is that prosecutors systematically reinforce confirmation bias in presenting their case. The probability that someone has brown eyes <i>and</i> is 5&#x27;7&quot; tall <i>and</i> lives in New York <i>and</i> knows the victim <i>and</i> has a motive etc. etc. would seem to be strong evidence (especially if you&#x27;re assuming them all to be independent, which they&#x27;re not), but that only works if you&#x27;re taking an unbiased sample of the possible characteristics of the perpetrator, which the prosecutor explicitly does the opposite of. If there is no apparent motive, or the knife used to kill the victim isn&#x27;t a match for the one the defendant is known to have, or the perpetrator was wearing a suit and the defendant isn&#x27;t known to own a suit, you won&#x27;t hear any of that from the prosecution. And if you only consider the things that match, using the article&#x27;s flawed method, all additional evidence can only ever increase the probability of guilt, since any evidence to the contrary doesn&#x27;t make it into the calculation. All you have to do is keep collecting evidence and excluding anything that doesn&#x27;t comport with the prosecution&#x27;s theory of the crime and soon you have a seemingly insurmountable case.<p>Then you have the &quot;DNA database&quot; problem with statistics. Take a 1 in 10,000 chance and it sounds like solid proof (&quot;99.99%&quot;) but if the population you&#x27;re testing against is 6,000,000,000 people then you still have a pool of suspects containing 600,000 people. You can&#x27;t then just pick one of those people arbitrarily and claim a 99.99% chance that that was the perpetrator, the probability that a person is the actual perpetrator if chosen at random from the group of individuals whose DNA would match is only ~0.000167%. It isn&#x27;t good enough to prove that a defendant is statistically in the top thousand people in the city as far as probability to have been the perpetrator of a particular crime. You still have to exclude <i>all</i> the others or you&#x27;ll convict the wrong man.",1375555895

It&#x27;ll matter later on when you get the hang of some more intermediate to advanced concepts.<p>My belief (and a question like this will solicit only beliefs from everyone even if presented as facts) is that you probably want a Unix-like OS if you&#x27;re getting into any web development. The only exception to that rule is if you&#x27;re going to be primarily using Microsoft technologies like .NET, C#, IIS, or any other number of MS technologies.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a rundown of what I&#x27;ve found the best uses for each OS are. This is coming from someone who prefers a Mac (used at home) and uses both Windows and Linux at work. So I&#x27;ve got a lot of experience with all 3 and have used them all for heavy web development projects.<p>Windows is just fine to start with. You have access to a lot of high level and mainstream tools like code editors and graphics programs. If you&#x27;re a point-and-click kind of person you&#x27;ll have no problem. Problems start to arise when you need to set up a local dev environment that would resemble a test or prod environment. You have to jump through hoops and install non-standard programs to get things like Rubygems, and different Ruby versions running locally. It&#x27;s not difficult per se but you&#x27;ll find out what I mean when I say its a hassle if you use any other OS. Also, the command line is sorely lacking on Windows and even tools like Cygwin leave something to be desired at times.<p>Macs are a great alternative to Windows and my
Preferred OS for web development. You get a beautiful interface that&#x27;s relatively easy to switch over to from Windows. You still get all the power of GUI tools plus the vast majority of Unix-y tools under the hood. It&#x27;s great for design (you can run Photoshop and other great tools natively) and you get equal or better variety of code editos like Wondows. Where the Mac really shines is once you start playing with the terminal. You&#x27;ve got almost all of the Unix tools you&#x27;d have in a prod environment installed by default and you can run things like RVM, Rbenv, and server stacks like AMP (apache, MySQL, PHP) or Nginx instead of Apache and generally just replicate a standard Ruby stack locally through the command line like you would in Linux or with MAMP-style programs. It lacks a decent package manager but tools like Homebrew take care of that for you. Macs, to me, are like Linux distros with top notch desig tools (and minus the freedom but I&#x27;m not speaking philosophically here).<p>Linux distros are very similar to OS X in a lot of ways but have extra Unix tools pre installed that a Mac doesn&#x27;t have (but can get). They&#x27;re not always the prettiest and its rare that a designer prefers them (I mention design because for me its a standard part of development) but they&#x27;re usually the most powerful when it comes to the 3 main OSes out there today. By power I don&#x27;t mean speed and the ability of the software to take advantage of the hardware. I mean it gives you powerful tools and an unspoken but understood &quot;Unix Way&quot; of doing things. There is a bit of a learning curve however. A local development environment on a Linux machine will most likely best mirror anything you&#x27;d publish online.<p>I went from Windows to Mac to Linux when I was learning web development. Windows let me jump right in with the real simple high level stuff but then gave me trouble when it was time to get more advanced. My Macs let me get all the way to an expert level and never got in my way. I was actually able to learn a lot about how Linux works on a Mac and transfer those skills over so when I got into Linux I was very comfortable. Linux taught me even more valuable skills, many of which I brought back to the Mac.<p>In the end I chose Mac as my preference because for me its a great middle ground between the absolute raw power of the Unix Way and its great GUI and support for design tools. I could use Linux and Mac with about equal ease and efficiency but Windows still cramps my style to this day no matter how much effort I put into learning its tools or &quot;way&quot; of doing things.<p>My advice to you is to worry about this decision later. You probably don&#x27;t have enough experience to know what you&#x27;re missing and what you&#x27;d prefer. And before switching from Windows to anything else just try what&#x27;s out there. Macs always look great in theory but wonderful as they are they&#x27;re not always for everyone. (I do have a feeling you will make a switch one day to something other than Windows no matter what - I say this because I&#x27;ve seen it many times and its not common for a web developer to prefer Windows unless, like I mentioned, you&#x27;re using a primarily MS-based tech stack).<p><i>The views expressed herein are my own and not meant to start a religious war over OS choice.

This means that any developer taking over Dart would have to support the IDE, the VM, the javascript transcoder, the language, integration with new browser features, cross browser compatibility, etc. This is practically impossible for hobbyists to do properly.<p>Why would Google drop Dart? Google is almost guaranteed to drop any project that does not have high traction and/or high income within a few years of release. Dart has neither income nor traction.

It&#x27;s possible that the vast majority of spacefaring species became spacefaring because they found a way to keep their philosophical understanding on par with their technological understanding. And given that possibility, it might not be a huge leap to assume a Prime Directive-like policy is at play.

I&#x27;d start by installing Ubuntu desktop inside Virtualbox and getting a rails environment set up there.

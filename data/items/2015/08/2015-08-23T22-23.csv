For example, every competent system engineer needs to be comfortable with scripting, bash/ksh/zsh on *nix, power shell and vbscript on windows.<p>I don’t know what kind of application is the author talking about, and what kind of support does he need. Here on windows I can automate things just fine.
Some apps, like all OS components, web browser, ms office, visual studio, and photoshop have their own APIs exposed, documented and supported. For other apps I can use OS-provided UI automation API if I need to.
In addition, the industry has shifted towards open file formats and network protocols. This makes possible to process other app’s data in a way that was impossible in the early days of that amiga’s, when most data formats were binary because performance.<p>Average end users ain’t doing all that things but that’s not a technical problem. Just demography and marketing. Old computers were expensive equipment targeted towards scientists and engineers. Modern computers are cheap, they’re for everyone from 5 years old to 100+ years old who use them to post selfies and watch cat movies.

Frankly, if websites are going to be so hostile to the user, the user should have no issues with returning the sentiment; I block JavaScript on all sites by default, and only enable it for certain types of content (like web apps, which you can’t expect to do anything useful without it) or sites that I trust.

Except for people using MS Access, or similar fiascos, there was always a centralized data store.<p>That doesn&#x27;t invalidate the claim that scripting is dying. Sure, us tech folk can  (and do) script all kinds of things, even even more so the Enterprise IT world, who practically lives and dies by powershell. But back in the 90s in particular, there were such a thing as &quot;power users&quot;, who would script the crap out of their systems. That really doesn&#x27;t exist so much anymore. Now people in that grey area between end users and the coders are more likely to be professional business analysts. The days of a true end user also creating their own custom scripts to merge data and functions from disparate apps is getting rare.<p>(Keep in mind, HN is an entire community of edge cases... of course we all can spit out exceptions to this trend.)<p>Now, I do not think this is a bad thing. On the contrary, most of those people were very hard to support, and the ones who did it well and were easy to support often ended up moving into IT/Analyst roles anyway. I think we are in a better place today, with a much larger population of coders and analysts, so the end users can just tell us what they need, then focus on the actual jobs.<p>But the claim that end user scripting is dying...

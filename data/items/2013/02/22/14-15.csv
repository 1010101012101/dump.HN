News at 11.<p>>In 2011 American cinemas sold 1.28 billion tickets, the smallest number since 1995. Last year, ticket sales rose back to 1.36 billion and box-office revenues to a record $10.8 billion<p>So the year over year volatility is in the single digits and following the economic recovery they're back to making record profits.<p>It seems like the only point the article makes is that that TV is doing better than film right now. But that isn't ""movies are doomed,"" just ""TV is doing really well.""<p>>A move from analogue to digital film enabled perfectionist directors to shoot more takes and touch them up afterward, using up expensive production and editing time. Studios have also started to make more tent pole films: big releases that can support the bottom line like a pole holds up a tent. These typically rely on expensive special effects, rather than compelling scripts, to attract a global audience.<p>Jevon's effect in action. The thing is, that's not actually a problem: If you're making more profit from doing that than it costs to do it, it's sustainable. If you're not, why are you doing it? Stop it and go back to creating a larger number of less expensive films based on compelling scripts rather than special effects. It seems to be what people are asking for anyway. You can't simultaneously expect to be taken seriously in complaining that what you're doing isn't working and refuse to change what you're doing.<p>They keep talking about John Carter as a failure. I saw it. It wasn't great. And the reason wasn't bad acting or bad special effects, it was that it had a mediocre script. So yeah, try hiring some better writers next time. They apparently cost less than special effects anyway. <p>>Between 2006 and 2012, the six big studios also cut the number of films they made by 14-54%, according to Nomura.<p>And then they wonder why they're not doing as well as they want to.<p>>And they started to pay actors and directors far less.<p>It's about time. Hard to find sympathy for ""we're not making enough money"" when you're still paying eight figure compensation to individuals.",1361545161

Intel is in a difficult situation with their products however in that one of their biggest concerns is competing with themselves too much.<p>Regarding the GPUs, Apple doesn't have the fastest mobile GPU - PowerVR from Imagination Technologies does. Intel can use a PowerVR SGX554MP4 if they wanted to integrate it. Is it better than an HD 4000? I honestly have no idea as I've never seen them actually compared (and note that the best mobile GPUs have miserable performance compared to discrete desktop GPUs, so don't assume that because the HD 4000 doesn't compete with a $400 gaming card that it can't compete with an Adreno or PowerVR).<p>EDIT: Just blew my mind to learn that the HD 4000 on the Intel SoC <i>is</i> a PowerVR GPU.",1361544986

While I agree with the articles issue with coding up a specific question (especially when it is yet another fizz-buzz - even if it has a twist to it) - the puzzle style interview can provide some kind of insight in to the thought process behind someones work. One company in particular really stood out by having a great white boarding exercise that not only was entertaining, but offered a decent amount of a challenge that it really made them a frontrunner in my final decision making process.

5264387,comment,5264100,5264100,13,0,cletus,,,"Ultimately I think Internet access will reach utility status (like water, electricity, telephony), meaning it will be a given (in the developed world at least and hopefully more and more of the developing world as time goes on).<p>It's still priced as a premium product and there's no reason for this other than regional monopolies over the last mile.<p>The one thing that confuses me about the France proposal is how they plan on building this for 20B euros when the NBN in Australia is estimated to cost A$36B [1] for a country with one third the population of France.<p>The biggest cost in any communications network is the last mile so is proportional to population but inversely proportional to population density. Population density is low in Australia but there is 1/3 of the people.<p>Additionally, there are significant regional infrastructure costs. It is more expensive per mile to build fibre in, say, New York City versus Tennessee.<p>Inter-city links are really a small part of the total cost, even in a country as spread out as Australia (given the size, the population is 95% on the coast).<p>Hopefully the NBN in Australia (which I'm a big supporter of) will survive the next election. The Opposition is sadly against it and the present government is hanging on by a thread and in leadership turmoil.<p>For those not from Australia, the current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, became PM after ousting Kevin Rudd in a partyroom coup d'etat in Rudd's first term, something with little precedent in Australian politics and certainly not in a PM's first term. For example, then-Treasurer Paul Keating ousted fourth-term PM Bob Hawke in much the same way.<p>This sort of thing isn't generally favoured the electorate because (IMHO) it's perceived as the Number 2 saying ""it's my turn to be Number 1"" yet it plagues politics (Hawke-Keating, Howard-Costello, Blair-Brown in the UK, etc). Keating went on to narrowly win the ""unwinnable"" 1993 election and then get destroyed in 1996.<p>Gillard narrowly won the last election with a minority in the House of Representatives [2]. Who became PM came down to horse-trading with minor parties and independents such that the change of a single seat changes the government. Obviously this is not a stable situation.<p>Anyway, things look grim for the Gillard government as Kevin Rudd won't go away. He has already failed (twice?) to take back the top job in a partyroom ballot and the issue is rearing its ugly head again.<p>Tony Abbott (the Opposition leader) has campaigned on a half-assed cheaper version of the NBN that is basically the same ADSL system for most people. Technically the proposal is FTTN (fibre to the node) where nodes are within 1.5km of premises and copper the rest of the way, which should improve bandwidth (ADSL2+ can do about 12Mbps at 1.5km and VDSL/VDSL2 could potentially raise that).<p>The worst thing for Australian broadband (IMHO) would be for the NBN to be gutted in this nascent stage but it could happen if the Opposition wins big in the next election.<p>Luckily for the NBN, the National Party, which notionally represents ""rural"" interests, the traditional party of the Liberal Party, is in favour of the NBN because current (and proposed) broadband solutions for rural areas suck hard.<p>Now all we need is non-backwards reasonably priced broadband in the United States. We can but hope.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillard_Government#Minority_government"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillard_Government#Minority_gov...</a>",1361544569

I even found 'How Would You Move Mount Fuji?' in the library and started reading through it. It was an absolute waste of time as I, fortunately, learned weeks before the interview. As an example, one of the questions I was asked was 'how would you write the C function strcmp() without using any libraries?'<p>My gripe these days is that places I've interviewed with now that I have a few years of experience are still concerned about big-O notation and a lot of the more academic questions. I feel like I shouldn't have to go back to my college notes to prep for an interview for a job that I'd really be using my current experience for. I think it comes down to other developers not spending time really thinking about the quality of their interview questions. They just do a search for 'programming interview questions' and call it a day.<p>My most recent interview was with Amazon. I was asked the dumb big-O runtime stuff as well as how I'd count all of the stars in the universe. It pissed me off, but I did like the question I was asked about how I'd design an elevator system and then asked how my solution would scale.

What I mean is that the protection that is intended by the thermal switch might be cleverly defeated. The thermal switch is usually mounted on the (metal frame) chassis, not always close to the parts that would catch fire. What I am suggesting is that one might find a way to cause a paper jam, and then get the paper to ignite before the chassis were heated enough to cause the thermal switch to open. It might even be dependent upon a specific model(s). I doubt it is possible to prevent without very careful placement of thermal switch(es). The kind of placement that would defy efficient manufacturing ideals, and possibly even user-safety-inspired design practices. TBH, I don't think it is likely to be a reliable ignition method.

The app itself:<p>If you have a small web app, you have an incredible advantage that makes your web app potentially way more secure than that of a big corporation: You write the code and you know the inside outs of the system. And you are probably the only one having passwords etc. to the system.<p>In a big corp, sometimes the interns write some code and they have no clue of web app security. From an attacker's perspective, one security hole is enough.<p>So, if you know about web app security, you're probably better off than any other big corp.<p>2. The server infrastructure:<p>If you worry about the server architecture, get a managed dedicated server. There's probably not really a guarantee that this system is set up perfectly, but there might be trustable hosters that know what they're doing.<p>- Keep everything up-to-date (apt-get update, apt-get upgrade).\n- Don't install software you don't know or can't trust\n- use SSH only with public key authentication, remap port 22 to something else\n- use SFTP + SSL for your website\n- don't include any third party JS-software that messes with your website. Personally, I don't even include Google Analytics. I self-host everything and install only stuff that is trustable.\n- don't use the root user if not necessary<p>There's this ""myth"" going on that every system is hackable. This is only partly true. You can't do anything against 0-day hacks, but if you protected your web app against XSS, SQLI etc. and your software is uptodate, there's hardly any chance that you get hacked.<p>What makes every system ""hackable"" is the human factor.

5264247,comment,5263687,5264081,3,0,fennecfoxen,,,"There is diversity in opinion on taxes in the US. There are also <i>inane</i> ""debates"" where people try to make their opponents' political opinions on taxes seem ridiculously outlandish and extremist, not infrequently for political gain.<p>In recent political events, US spending got hiked about 50% from ~$2T to ~$3T a year (with modest growth associated with inflation and a growing population). Initially this was under the Bush administration and the auspices of bailouts and the like, but the Obama administration has made these increases part of the permanent baseline. The conflict here is whether to hike tax revenues 50% as well, or cut the budget back towards where it was in 2007 or so. Perhaps more Americans would support proposed additional taxes if they thought the additional government spending over the past several years had materially impacted their lives in a positive manner? Economic decisions are made on the margin, after all; it's a question of more taxes or fewer, and not like anyone's seriously calling to disband the fire department (of course, the hype says differently).<p>(Any spending related to Obamacare once it goes into effect is not even addressed in these figures, so it would be additional.)<p>More imminently, there is a lot of hype about how a catastrophic ""sequester"" would end up shutting down the federal government and ending meat inspections and starving social security recipients (Democrat hype) or shutting down the military and starving all our veterans (Republican hype) -- however, even with the automatic sequester, the federal government budget would be larger in 2013 than in 2012; it's only a cut relative to the growth that was previously baked into certain budget assumptions.<p>Other fun bits: In December the Republicans proposed tax reform which would have raised revenue by keeping rates low but limiting deductions. The Democrats didn't like the plan, they got their way, and ultimately there were tax hikes instead. Besides not fitting with the headline programme of ""let's tax the rich!!"" a salient reason that the Democrats didn't like this plan is that <i>state income taxes</i> in a lot of high-tax states electing lots of Democrats are also a major source of income-tax deductions. That bit didn't get a lot of press.<p>(Oh, and the campaign promise that's still on Barack Obama's website? $2.50 in spending cuts for every $1 in new taxes, to close the deficit? Yeah, the White House has proposed budgets and they don't look anything like spending cuts.)",1361542285

Jailing people is our answer to almost every problem. We imprison people even when it is obvious that imprisonment has a strong counter-productive effect. Yet, in one population where I'd argue that imprisonment would have a strong deterrent effect... nothing. It's not as though there is a lack of evidence of serious crime, either.

They don't scale well. After more than a few points, especially if they don't naturally correlate, it becomes harder to follow than simple prose. If you find it difficult to bring the points together, try recording yourself going down the list and briefly explaining each one in turn to a rubber duck.<p>- Try to use only as many words as you need to, but no more or less. Several of your points could have been rolled into one more coherent point, and some of them could have used a little more digging too. Again, reading aloud would help with this.<p>- ""Takeaways / Action"" as a header is a little forward. Let the reader decide for themselves what the takeaway should be, or if you want to address them directly, do so. It's already implied that someone taking their time to read your article is looking for a takeaway to make it worth their while.<p>- Spell check before you post.",1361542267

Paradoxically I think its deployment has been hampered by a good early ADSL coverage and the associated low prices on ADSL (with uncapped data). These low prices have decided the operators to only make minimum investments on their networks and to further seek to make profit in mobile where data plans are capped and where profits are better. Moreover the entry of a new actor in the mobile space last year has further exacerbated the situation, this actor has significantly reduced the subscriptions prices so the others actors seek to differentiate themselves and one way they found is to invest in LTE networks. So for all these reasons until now FTTH had low priority in France and is marginal. I hope it will change soon.",1361542123

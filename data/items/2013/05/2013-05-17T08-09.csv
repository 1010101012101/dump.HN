However the critical thing (besides design) is how are you going to attract the required mass of users to keep it vivid. So far there's little incentive to put my content there, and without content there's no incentive to visit the site. The loop is closed. Maybe you could consider an easy way for users to automatically put their content from other places, via RSS for example? That way you could focus on the discovery not content creation.",1368781198

As a parent to two pretty active pre-schoolers, I can attest that their behavior will frequently mirror that of their parents and other significant adults. In other words - if their father behaves in a calm and patient manner, they will tend to do the same, subsequently if not immediately.<p>Also, the education system in the western world has become increasingly standardized and formalized in the last few decades, especially in primary education, to the point that all kids from kindergarten on are expected to conform to a standard of behavior and development. Unfortunately, not all kids are the same. Some find it harder to sit down for prolonged periods, some have a healthy amount of energy and need an outlet, like those puppies who can go out in the yard and chase their own tail for half an hour.<p>This raises a lot of questions, not only about ADHD, but also about retarded mental development or other disabilities. I believe for those kids, the worst thing one can do is to label them as ADHD and medicate them. They just need a different approach, or a different rhythm.<p>To me it seems that the real difference between countries like France and countries like the US really has to do with the way so-called abnormal kids (or adults for that matter) are received in society. Based on my experience, it seems that the French are more tolerant.",1368779194

The cost of goods are set by looking at the intersection of the people willing and able to supply the good, and the set of people willing to pay for the good.  See, for example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand</a><p>But the point is that you've found an equilibrium in the system with the current price, current suppliers, and current customers.  There are customers would would have happily paid more.  There are people who WOULD have bought the good if it cost less, but it doesn't so they didn't.  There are people who are happily supplying it and making mad bank.  There are people who are supplying it and making a razor-thin margin.  There are people who WOULD supply it if the available price were higher, so they're not supplying it right now.  The price is an efficient equilibrium point, but it's not the global arbiter of value.",1368779140

Back then it was portals, aggregation, hosting, and ISPs. But it turned out that technological advancements erased a lot of the reasons why those things could be profitable (at least the way they were). Instead the next big things were search, web-apps, and social features (Web 2.0). Livejournal, blogger, flickr, google, google maps, etc. What people figured out, eventually, is that even if you have a million users that doesn't mean that it's easy to make even a million dollars a year.<p>Now, of course, there are lots of people who think they know what the ""big thing"" is, and companies are again shelling out billions for acquisitions, few of which will seem sensible in 10 years, or even 5.",1368778973

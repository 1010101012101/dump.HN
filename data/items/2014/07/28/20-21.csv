Before infix.cl and Readable, back in the 1970&#x27;s, there was also something called CGOL[1]. This was described in a 1976 MIT paper by Pratt R.

Overly broad categories lead to suspicion.<p>It&#x27;s funny though, because for years, we all downloaded/installed desktop apps which had free reign on our machines. I suppose the facts that apps can come from untrusted sources, are thought to have more specific functions, are installed on very personal devices, and were born in an age where privacy concerns/fraud/malware/connectedness were common, all have something to do with it.<p>I wonder, though, if our concern is mostly stimulated by the fact that we&#x27;re now being presented with permission choices in the first place. As, now, even &quot;trusted&quot; brands like HBO can earn our suspicion if we think their apps are being greedy with permission requests.",1406581095

Thus, you need to subtract your effective VAT rate and the net effective rate that you end up paying on the MAS is about 10-15%. Which is very close to what you would pay for, say, FastSpring (&quot;You have the option to pay either 8.9% flat or 5.9% plus $.95 per transaction&quot; [1]). The biggest advantage of the MAS is that it&#x27;s a distribution channel preinstalled on every single Mac - that&#x27;s extremely valuable.<p>As you say, you would ideally sell on both the MAS and outside. In terms of selling outside the MAS, it does come with some overhead, mostly related to VAT.

However, from 1 January 2015, the place of taxation will be determined by the location of the consumer.<p>It&#x27;s not a big deal since you can just sign up for the VAT MOSS but it&#x27;s still more hassle than just putting up an app on the MAS.

You can get soup in cuboid packs, but I don&#x27;t think it keeps as well, plus it&#x27;s only good for smooth-textured soups that you can pour. If you have any kind of chunky or textured soup (which lots of people like), then opening it means unfolding/cutting the whole top of the container, which has a higher risk of spillage and requires more hand strength (for a kitchen scissors vs. a can opener). You do see it more commonly for things like chicken stock or other &#x27;base&#x27; ingredients for cooking at scale.<p>Space saving matters a lot during shipping, on shelves not so much. The first job I ever had was stacking shelves in a  supermarket as a teenager and I was so bored I would pass the time by calculating the volumes that fit on palette, on display and so on :) 25 years later not much has changed - most supermarkets still stack products 2 high and 2 deep or 1 high and 3 deep (depending on how stackable the product is), not least to limit the potential for mess.

I just finished my first full Swift app this weekend, and by far, the most bothersome part was interacting with the C APIs (CoreMedia, ImageIO, etc.) I would have loved to see more examples of interacting with framework objects like CGImageSources, CMSampleBuffers, etc.<p>For example, CGImageSourceCreateWithURL() returns an Unmanaged<CGImageSource>!. You can&#x27;t pass that object to CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(), because it expects a CGImageSource!. Instead, you have to call takeUnretainedValue() on the Unmanaged to extract the raw pointer. Not terribly difficult, just mildly annoying and not well documented. In C/ObjC, you&#x27;d just take the return value of the first function and pass it right into the second.<p>Another example: CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer() returns a CVImageBuffer!. And CVPixelBufferLockBaseAddress() takes a CVPixelBuffer! as its argument. In C/ObjC, CVPixelBufferRef is typedef&#x27;d to CVImageBufferRef, but that doesn&#x27;t carry over in Swift. I tried to figure out the opaque-pointer voodoo required to convert from one to the other, and eventually gave up, wrote the function in Objective-C, and moved on.<p>Swift is shaping up to be an excellent language, but at this point, the casting/wrapping/unwrapping hurdles make it difficult for newcomers and experienced developers alike to take advantage of Apple&#x27;s 15+ year corpus of powerful APIs.",1406579368

You can sort-of approximate this on the MAS but none of the options are ideal.<p>In my opinion, you absolutely must give people the chance to try your product. This means having a trial build on your website, which most Mac indies do but it&#x27;s a bit problematic for paid apps, as I presume a lot of people on the MAS itself are unaware. It&#x27;s in the best interest of everyone to have trials - for customers, so that they don&#x27;t feel duped and actually buy a product they&#x27;re happy with and for developers, so that they acquire real customers, not play a game of &quot;can we convince people to fork over money without trying&quot;.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s in the best interest of customers to actually provide paid updates - they can vote with their wallet whether a business should survive. But without the proper availability of paid updates, customers are left with no choice, even if they did want to support developers. Unfortunately, the voice of a vocal minority instils fear in developers to try and charge for such updates.<p>Given the current climate, our plan for the future is to lower our initial price and offer major versions as paid updates. Instead of, say, charging $40 for the current version + $20 for an update, we&#x27;ll just always charge $30 for the current version. As a side effect, it lowers the entry for everyone and your real customers can still vote with their wallets and support your efforts, if they choose to do so. One of the downsides is the introduction of a new SKU which is not that much of a problem (before the MAS, you had to do the same anyhow). It&#x27;s usually wise to provide a way for customers to stay in touch with you and hear about updates but only if they want to (don&#x27;t smack dialogs repeatedly in their face, that&#x27;s just not nice).",1406579027

As the most fundamental tool in a programmer&#x27;s toolbox, I think devs have the right to ask for stability from their language/compiler. A new language version may mean new language features, but it&#x27;s OK for devs to want to incorporate those features at their own pace, not have the language choose for them.<p>Without a focus on backwards compatibility, this means devs have to choose between bug fixes and perf improvements and new language constructs. This isn&#x27;t a good place to be in.<p>At the same time, I understand the realization language designers and compiler devs have when they find out they were doing something wrong all along, or that an old feature was simply a special case of a new feature. Sometimes that means syntax breaking changes. It&#x27;s hard to deal with, as the owner of a product, when you see something which you know could be better, but is held back by existing installs.",1406578120

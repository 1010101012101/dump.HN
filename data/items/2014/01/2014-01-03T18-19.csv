It&#x27;s not unreasonable for Disney to want to protect Mickey<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;unreasonable&quot; for the Sherlock Holmes estate to want to keep everything to do with that character too, but tough beans, they don&#x27;t get to.<p>> and if you wrote a Mickey story, it&#x27;s possible that people could feel that a 3rd party product is endorsed by Disney.<p>Disney is on the <i>same</i> footing as all other citizens in utilizing the public-domain Mickey character.  It&#x27;s <i>always</i> possible when someone builds on a work that had entered the public domain for that new work to be attributed mistakenly to the original author.  This isn&#x27;t an excuse for the former copyright holder to have <i>any</i> additional rights over the work.<p>> 2. Mickey Mouse ears - Pretty clearly a trademark violation. Outside of the domain of copyright entirely.<p>Disagree, although this out of my area of expertise. The point of trademark is for brand/company recognition.  Trademarks can&#x27;t be made of &quot;the idea of Mickey Mouse&quot; once Micky has entered the public domain, so I don&#x27;t see how Micky ears would violate it.  I could trademark a particular 19th century drawing of Shakespere <i>when used as a logo for my company</i>, and it would be protected in that role on, e.g., packaging and advertisements.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean others can&#x27;t sell reproductions of the painting or make t-shirts out of it.",1388775502

The tech. industry would <i>love</i> to have more housing in San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area. Housing prices have increased so quickly, and are currently at such a high level that even highly paid tech. workers are thinking twice about moving to SF. We see it often enough in the comment threads right here.<p>The problem is that the existing residents of San Francisco would like to preserve their relatively low density city, and <i>simultaneously</i> cram several million more people into it. In every other growing city, swathes of older, low-density housing are torn down and replaced with higher density apartment and condominium blocks. These high-density urban high-rises relieve the pressure on the remaining, cheaper, low density residential properties, while simultaneously adding additional economic growth and neighborhood vitality. It just seems that the residents of San Francisco have made a collective choice that they&#x27;d rather have the &quot;charm&quot; of their &quot;historic&quot; (like you can call anything less than 200 years old historic) city, rather having a city that people can move into and live in on less than programmer wages.",1388775476

When parents don&#x27;t stay together, the only logical way to divide the burden of raising a child is to allocate 50% of the monetary expenses and 50% of the labor to each parent. Anything that allocates less than this to fathers is a huge subsidy from women to men.<p>As for employers, finger-painting is pre-K, which isn&#x27;t universally free in the states. Starting in Kindergarten, education starts with basic literacy. The production of a literate and numerate workforce is a huge subsidy to employers. The crack about remedial math actually undermines your position: its remedial math that creates the huge population of people who have enough basic numeracy to operate a cash register, thus driving the cost of cashiers down to almost nothing. Also, the high supply of literate and numerate labor drives down the wages of each marginal employee, allowing employers to capture a higher percentage of the value generated by the employee. If an employer makes $25 per hour off of someone he pays $10, and public education makes that person employable, then right there the employer benefits mord from education than the employee. Finally, remember that in the states education is funded by property taxes, which are largely paid for by families and not businesses. So families pay most of that $11k per year, not businesses.<p>And leaving aside the benefit to employers, why do you call K12 a subsidy to mothers, rather than both fathers and mothers equally?",1388774722

You fail to see that this is a problem with PHP, and only think of it as a problem with programmers.<p>Your willingness to accept that programmers should need to know more than they should, combined with an unwillingness to rethink your beliefs when presented with evidence that this has lead to real problems, is a perfect example of my point that PHP, &quot;has attracted a community that fails to recognize these things as problems.&quot;",1388774609

Drives internally rotate active blocks in and out of the spare pool to try to keep the number of writes to each similar (&#x27;wear levelling&#x27;). When you write to a flash drive — including trying to overwrite data to destroy it as someone might on a magnetic disk — it will generally pull a block from the spare pool for the new data, and put the old block in the spare pool.<p>The spare pool is invisible to the OS, but it is reasonable to assume that there are ‘secret’ commands to access it — not because some TLA demands it, but because the hardware/firmware engineers need it for development and debugging.<p>BUT there is a great big BUT. Writing flash is a two-step process. Programming flash can only change a 1 bit to a 0. Before this, there has to be a slower erase step, that sets the block to all 1s. In order to avoid this performance-killing overhead on every write, flash drives erase as much as possible (whether spare pool blocks or TRIMmed visible blocks) in the background as soon as possible.",1388774593

So unless you are arguing that everybody should be able to use them (in which case, I leave the discussion for not being interested in debating the topic), you need to accept the fact that there has to be a user-level feature for backup. At which point, unless it is badly implemented, it is probably far easier and safe than trying to mirror with rsync your phone and then figure out how to handle software upgrades, restores, different partitions, separate software from data, and whatnot.<p>Moreover, I would add that file-based manipulation in my opinion is useful when the single files do expose some value. If I need to backup a sqlite DB with my contacts with rsync, I might as well use a high-level tool that offers me much more without me having to write DB-manipulation code, for instance, syncing/converting with the address book on my OS that might be in a different format. On the other hand, if I edit a .odt file on a tablet, I can see a value in directly manipulating with the shell, as that file is something that I create and I want to access and move around.<p>But only a subset of the things that I want to backup are document files that I created. If I backup the settings of my phone, I wouldn&#x27;t even want to know HOW they are stored. And assuming I found out, I don&#x27;t want to be bothered to thinking if direct file copying is the correct way to restore it on a newer/older version of the operating system. This is a level of detail that is beyond what <i>I</i> (personally) want to know about a smartphone.<p>So, to rephrase, does the shell on a smartphone empower you to do things that you couldn&#x27;t reasonably expect to be implemented as consumer-level features?",1388774483

If you want it to work - choose the relationship more than you choose work. I know from experience, because I used to have a similar mentality. It goes something like this:<p>If I want to have the most fulfilling life possible, I should make &quot;progress&quot; every day. I feel as though I have the capability and drive to be the best, so I have the <i>responsibility</i> to be the best. If I&#x27;m not working, there is someone else out there who is working, and that means I&#x27;m &quot;wasting time&quot;. Relaxing = being lazy.<p>Those people who just socialize and play video games? How can they not see how much time they are wasting on a meaningless life! Everyone should spend their time doing things that are &quot;productive&quot; to better their skillset. Otherwise, they are lazy and unmotivated.<p>Simply put-  this is being a workaholic. Through college, I was the same way, and it cost me a lot of missed opportunities. The most dangerous workaholic is one who thinks that it&#x27;s healthy and good for them.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - be motivated, enjoy what you do, etc. But <i>have balance</i>. I was fortunate enough to meet my (now wife) who showed me that it&#x27;s ok to take a break. It&#x27;s not &quot;being unproductive&quot; or &quot;wasting time&quot; - it&#x27;s building a relationship. It&#x27;s ok (and often necessary) to drop everything and spend time focused on making the relationship better.<p>In your post, you mentioned Mr. Walton. Let&#x27;s briefly talk about him. While I don&#x27;t know if the source is true (ref. needed), Consider this post [1] that talks about his last words: &quot;I blew it&quot;. While it&#x27;s my opinion, I strongly believe you can make a bigger impact in this world through the relationships you build as opposed to the work you do.<p>So, it&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re motivated and driven - it means you&#x27;ll be good at whatever you do. But don&#x27;t think poorly of those who do things differently, and put their efforts into different outlets. It doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re somehow less productive of a person than you. In fact, I would recommend working to break away from the workaholic mentality. Just like forcing yourself to get a good night&#x27;s sleep, it will be tough at first, and you will feel like your &quot;being unproductive&quot;, but it will make your relationship - and your life - much better.<p>[1] <a href""http://upstart.bizjournals.com/resources/executive-forum/2013/07/16/mike-michalowicz-on-sam-walton.html?page=al"" rel""nofollo"">http://upstart.bizjournals.com/resources/executive-forum/201...</a>",1388773968

Land is expensive in big cities, and even small warehouses are pretty large.<p>They don&#x27;t have to be downtown.<p>Regardless, you&#x27;re thinking about this the wrong way. As a service that must serve everyone and deliver everything instead of as an opportunistic service, which is a smarter way to approach the problem from a business perspective.<p>Amazon already has warehouses, fulfillment centers, in several major metro areas.<p>Let me state that again, because it&#x27;s hugely important. Amazon already has warehouses in some cities. They have to have their FCs somewhere, and the places where they are, like Seattle, already have a comparative advantage when it comes to fulfillment of commonly stocked items.<p>This changes the problem dramatically. It transforms it from: buy high priced land in major cities, build FCs there, set up drone operations; to: set up drone operations in a few cities where you already have large, well stocked warehouses, and then pilot the program opportunistically in those cities. Then expand the program to other cities depending on how successful and profitable the pilot program turns out to be.<p>This is business 101, you leverage what you&#x27;ve already got to mitigate risk and reduce development and acquisition costs.",1388772845

Achieving hard things is not innately rewarding, at least not for everyone. Maybe it&#x27;s rewarding if your goal is meaningful, but how many people honestly have meaningful jobs? Wiring in another CRUD app? Shoot me now.<p>If people enjoyed their work that much, they wouldn&#x27;t probably need you to advise them to do it. For someone who&#x27;s struggling with their work life balance, it&#x27;s far from clear that &#x27;Work more!&#x27; is the answer to their happiness.<p>I know that, before I started only seriously coding a few hours a day and taking three day weekends, and spending the rest of the time on less focused stuff like meetings and planning and mentoring our newbies (favourite work-related activity), I basically had to take a long break from working every couple of years just to recuperate; get my mental ducks in a line, do some stuff that has nothing to do with work. Something I worry that you may not realise is that, for some people, focus and creativity are finite resources.<p>What fuels those resources? Well, it seems to vary. Among other things, I enjoy swimming, reading fan-fiction of varying quality, and martial arts. I don&#x27;t think I could function as a programmer if I didn&#x27;t do those things.<p>There was a time - back with the open-plan office coincidentally - when I didn&#x27;t. When I was just getting into programming and it was all work work work. Sure, I&#x27;ll pull the weekend, sure I&#x27;ll help with this. I just wanted to make people happy.<p>Eventually I noticed I was tired <i>all the time</i>, and my creativity and all the fun ideas I used to have just weren&#x27;t there for me any more. I even stopped dreaming, and feeling emotionally connected to people. Not in a metaphorical sense, I was just so mentally knackered that I went to sleep and woke up in the morning with the impression no time had passed and not even a fleeting image of what I&#x27;d been dreaming. People would smile at me and it didn&#x27;t make me feel happy any more.<p>Would the answer for me really have been to work more?<p>Your advice may be very good for some people, but in so far as you don&#x27;t know everyone, it&#x27;s probably a bit risky in terms of how people are going to respond to tell everyone to do it.<p>Would I have unsubscribed? No, not if I found what you were saying in other respects worthwhile - I understand that you probably just want to help people and that&#x27;s a nice thing, so I&#x27;d go with the benefit of the doubt rather than the content of the post. (Like when someone wishes me Merry Christmas - so what if I&#x27;m not a Christian? They want me to be happy, so Merry Christmas too!) But not everyone&#x27;s going to see it like that, and writing it as more like, &quot;What I&#x27;ve found make <i>me</i> happy at the moment.&quot; Potentially offers less that someone might take offence to if it&#x27;s harder to read it as a statement about how you think they should live their lives. ^_^",1388772834

Your description is the B2C side, your first focus is to build something for the end users - those filing a claim. Ultimately, they are just going to become an attorney&#x27;s client and that is the B2B side, the business that is actively organizing the lawsuit.<p>I would attack it from the B2B side.   TV is full of ads for this class action stuff, attorneys obviously have the budget to advertise, and really all they want is leads for those potential clients. Create a cheaper more effective way for them to find those leads by building and running online advertising campaigns. You could probably get high tech and use targeting algorithms to find the most likely clients/leads, etc. We know they don&#x27;t have that, because they are spending so much on TV ads which are pretty untargeted and I would assume more expensive on a cost per lead basis. (How much is a lead worth to these law firms?)<p>B2B first gives a couple key benefits 1) the lawyer is paying to grow your userbase, maybe even profit if you want it - growing a sizable userbase is going to be expensive, this is not a sexy space so I wouldn&#x27;t count on the crowd and virility  2) leads generated now, are also leads in the future - even if they didn&#x27;t qualify for the lawsuit they signed up for, you can market future ones to them for basically no cost.<p>Once the attorneys start having you promote their lawsuits to find clients. You can then start maintaining the claim-to-client matching system; monthly emails of new suits, etc and generally approach the B2C side of it at that point.  I think going straight B2C is going to come off spammy and you&#x27;re not going to get the needed traction. I think you want to build trust with the users, so you have the opportunity to match them with multiple lawsuits and extend their lifetime value.<p>My $0.02, could easily be completely wrong.",1388772440

One thing people tend to struggle with when new technology comes around is that it has a different set of tradeoffs and advantages/disadvantages than the current dominant technology. But that doesn&#x27;t make it inferior or impractical, just different.<p>Consider horses vs. automobiles, for example. Horses conveniently can be bred, so owning a horse can potentially give you more value than just having a means of transport or labor. Horses can also be trained for a variety of tasks, they can get better at their job over time. Horses are also excellent at traveling along uneven ground. They can travel along city streets or country roads and dirt paths or through forests and open fields or even through mountain passes. In comparison, cars, especially early cars like the model T, are inferior to horses in a great many ways. But it turns out that the few key advantages of automobiles are more than sufficient to make up for the down sides, which is why automobiles won out.<p>Similarly, if you imagine that drones must be a 100% drop in replacement for FedEx/UPS you&#x27;ll rapidly come to the idea that the whole endeavor must be nonsense. But if instead drones only provide a complementary service then they can still be a feasible addition to delivery options. Even if drones only delivered high priced orders (say, more than $1k) to businesses with special drone landing spots it would still likely be a profitable and successful venture. Being able to have something delivered the same day in mere hours is a game changer in a lot of ways.<p>Imagine how much that would put Amazon even more into the existing business space of, say, home depot, as a simple example. If a home builder could order a replacement circular saw to be delivered to the work site in an hour without having to send someone out to a store that&#x27;s a big deal. And there are countless examples of where the value of having some durable good delivered as soon as possible is immense, and would more than justify exorbitant drone delivery fees.",1388772115

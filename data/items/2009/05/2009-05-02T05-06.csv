does browser count as app? if so, then all I need is chrome. I have several desktop apps created from chrome for various web apps.

I just watched a recent clip of a top boxoffice film in '08 and let's just say it was insanely racy compared to just ten years ago. I bet India will be having the same insane feminist driven society in 50 years.",1241243185

The ability to launch work GMail in one window, personal GMail in another window, and Lala.com in a third window and have them all running in separate processes that can't bring each other down has been a great help.<p>2) Eclipse. It's an 800lb gorilla but I've been using it for years (shortly after it was open-sourced). It can do Java, Scala, PHP, and many others.<p>3) TextMate. Because firing up Eclipse to write a Python or Ruby script is overkill. I also like that I can type ""mate ."" in the terminal and get the current directory in the project drawer.<p>4) Safari/Webkit. I used Firefox for a long time, but on the Mac it just can't compare to Webkit, especially once the Developer tools were introduced.<p>5) Terminal.app. I currently have 3 windows open for a total of 12 tabs. What I really mean is the unix under-pinnings, but Terminal.app is how you get to those.<p>Nothing very exciting in the list above, but those are the apps that I spend 90% of my time using.",1241242973

I'm not aware of any attempts to contest the takedowns, which is probably because they were completely justified. :)<p>My understanding, based on what I saw of the relevant pages before they got taken down, is that BluWiki got a takedown because their users were (possibly inadvertently?) attempting to reverse-engineer an encrypted metadata database on the iPod which used the exact same format as the FairPlay key database on the computer.",1241242547

589586,comment,589515,589515,0,0,coffeemug,,,"This is nonsense. When you transition from a programmer to a manager you don't give up an art, you trade one art for another. Getting a large group of people sufficiently motivated for a prolonged period of time to build great products is insanely difficult. I haven't seen evidence that it's any easier than writing good code. Just try it, and see what happens.",1241242219

That the whole purpose of feminism is to fight against those who are not as enlightened as y ou.<p>You saying ""almost anyone would agree you should pick the better candidate"" tells me that you can't see out of your own perspective long enough to realize there is discrimination out there.<p>Which is why you can't see my point.  My whole point was that these people are out there and that reasoning with them is pointless BECAUSE they aren't making a rational decision in the first place.  So the feminist who try to fight against them with rational arguments are wasting their time BECAUSE those people have choosen to disregard all rational evidence.",1241241619

589570,comment,589527,589527,0,0,makecheck,,,"1. A text editor that is powerful, stable, and basically good for programming.  I rely on ""vim"" almost always, but Xcode is a nice fallback.<p>2. A powerful terminal.  On Linux, ""aterm"" is the best I have ever found.  On Mac, I prefer MacTelnet but Apple's Terminal is pretty good.<p>3. A suite of infrastructure tools.  I've been in the Unix universe for many years, so it's hard to imagine anything except the usual suspects: ls, find, grep, awk, xargs, etc. all joined through shells, Perl and Python.  These are definitely ""must have""; even if they don't qualify as a single app, they certainly qualify as a single entity I couldn't live without.  (And having stumbled my way through Windows' inadequacies, I now know this painfully well.)<p>4. A web browser, and by extension, Google.  I like OmniWeb the most, though I use Firefox at work.  I've even been known to use Lynx, or the occasional automation through ""wget"".  There is simply no faster way to get information anymore; I'm more likely to web search for tools than run ""man"" pages, even.<p>5. E-mail.  I prefer a trivial ""send"" interface (I like basic command line ""mail"" sometimes, though ""pine""/""alpine"" are my favorite).  I do use Thunderbird and Apple's Mail quite a bit.  I am not a fan of overly complex tools, but the ability to tag and search/filter mail by tag is a really compelling Thunderbird feature.",1241240899

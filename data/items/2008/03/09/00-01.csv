132263,comment,132188,132188,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Basically any topic where you know what hypothesis look like, and there is lots of data floating around.<p>Medical diagnosis is an area where ML should be used, but isn't. It's been discovered that a decision tree beats a cardiologist for heart attack triage, but no one will touch it (1). In research, it is often used to discover genetic regulatory networks, and other such things. Basically, ML is replacing what would be a boring job for a grad student.<p>Also look at marketing. Thanks to their ML systems, Walmart knows that people buy poptarts to prepare for a hurricane.<p>(1) If a cardiologist kills 10/1000 people due to human error (whoops, forgot the aspirin), it happens. If a computer program kills 5/1000 people due to classification error it's 5 lawsuits waiting to happen, provided you can find a cardiologist to say ""In hindsight, I would have gotten that right.""",1205024107

Probably not enough to live on, but the beauty of independent gaming is that you can keep revising and expanding on an innovative concept, gradually growing your own market over a period of many years.",1205023401

Preferences can be saved per-site, nice for cookie management.  OmniWeb also lets you create a list of regexes for things to always load and things to never load, e.g. files from known ad servers.<p>It has some unique features too.  For example, you can ""yank"" any text field from a web page into its own window, at which point you can make it as big as you want.  Also, its tabs show miniature web pages.<p>The ""downside"" (if you can call it that) is that the browser isn't free.  But it is cheap at $15, and for something I use 100 times a day I figure I can afford it.",1205022781

OK, I guess that's something to think about.  I kinda think it's part of a parents job to decide what young children see and hear.  Hard core pornography, extreme violence, cultist propaganda of most kinds, and various forms of hate speech, all fall into the category of ""things young children shouldn't have to figure out yet"", for me.  They'll see/hear it all when they get a little older, and that's OK, but we're talking about the Veggie Tales age group: 3-5 years old, or so.",1205021590

That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s written in the same explanatory tone that I would use in person while trying to convey the concepts.  I wish more people would write like this.<p>I think of these things like lectures in college.  Assuming that a) you have all the context up to that point, b) you grok every step, and c) it doesn&#x27;t run beyond the length of you attention span - call it an hour - then you can learn astonishing things in a matter of a few sessions.  But if you miss a step, and don&#x27;t raise your hand because you think your question is stupid, then you might as well pack up and go home.<p>I find that even though the time element of articles is removed, I still trip over certain sections because the author was too lazy to anticipate my thinking process, which forces me to search other sites for the answers, and before you know it the impact of the writing has been completely diluted.",1415062730

We are adapting our gradiometers to make them more field-usable (which might have considerable use in prospecting), but that&#x27;s not a huge science priority at present. Every few years, we look hard at whether or not we can make a superior mobile gradiometer. If we could, you&#x27;d probably know :).  We have one new design that might fit into a borehole; if it works well-enough, we may chase commercialization.<p>A lot of the imaging market appears to come from security/defense applications, either in portal-monitoring or for IED detection. There are defense contractors working on both. The former is easily spoofed (put your uranium pit in a styrofoam sphere in a truck full of grain, done), and the latter is hard to do at speed in a rugged environment.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to do gravitational imaging on the sub-meter scale, and while it does work, it&#x27;s hard to get sufficient image resolution to be useful for anything other than a party trick.<p>If our other science weren&#x27;t more interesting, I&#x27;d be doing it for fun alone. Burning 3-6 months on the project to assess feasibility was as far as I wanted to go without a clear exit strategy.",1415062588

Space being the biggest key on the keyboard, people would commonly hit space to advance.

8554603,comment,8553501,8554316,0,0,moogleii,,,"I could be interpreting your comment wrong, but it seems to put the onus heavily on the teacher, which seems a bit naive. My friend just started teaching in New York actually. And she specifically wanted to teach at a Title 1 school (i.e. poor) in order to reach students with less income and opportunity (she teaches an East Asian language in a predominantly non-Asian minority community). That was the idealized plan anyway. Yet, the school won&#x27;t give her basic supplies. There is no lounge. No fridge. Ok, fine, that&#x27;s tolerable (odd to me since I too was raised in an affluent community). But the teacher&#x27;s need paper. There is a locked up supply room full of supplies, but the teachers are told they can&#x27;t have access to it. Why? Nobody knows. Printing rights are curbed.<p>And on top of that all, NYC DoE requires a masters. That equals debt, if you went to a &quot;good&quot; school. But the DoE pays crap. Oh and for some reason at one point, the DoE lowered requirements to be a principal. 3 years of part time teaching, and you could be a principal. Her principal taught dancing for 3 years, and is now purportedly fit to analyze the effectiveness of foreign language teaching methods. But anyway, that&#x27;s beside the point, that&#x27;s just describing the environment.<p>Her program is new. But instead of asking students/parents and filtering for those who might be interested in an East Asian language, the administrators decided to randomly force students into the class, regardless of their prior language history or their year. You know what you get with that? Hostile students. The kind that scream fuck you in your face. OK, fine, just &quot;standard&quot; difficult students. But like any other job, if your &quot;manager&quot; has your back, you can usually deal. But this school doesn&#x27;t believe in detention. Okay... The &quot;dream&quot; is that if a student is causing trouble, the deans will talk to said student. Uh oh, what wasn&#x27;t accounted for was the saturation of the deans time due to trouble students. Now you got deans telling you that, sorry, they can&#x27;t deal with disruptive students telling you to fuck off because they&#x27;re overloaded. So now you have fire support and you&#x27;re in the trenches alone. I&#x27;m not even going to get into the gay teacher&#x27;s story. Once the students caught onto that...<p>This doesn&#x27;t even include off-the-clock work that is required, which I won&#x27;t get into. I&#x27;m sorry, but as someone in the tech field, or any privatized field, the shit that teachers have to put off with is insane.<p>I know teachers have been demonized, but the turnover rate in NYC for teachers is apparently extremely high (I have another friend working at the DoE itself). I&#x27;ll have to get a source, but I seem to recall her saying it was around 70% after 2 years. And after hearing all the ridiculous war stories, I&#x27;m not surprised. Ha, another one of my teacher friends was moved to an empty classroom. Upon asking for desks, the administrators told her &quot;we don&#x27;t know where they are&quot; and left it at that. So she had to essentially salvage desks marked for discard.<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure how VAM works, but I&#x27;m skeptical that an algorithm can model something so complex.",1415062429

8554595,comment,8550448,8553325,0,0,PavlovsCat,,,"> If you translate your entire comment to the non-browser development arena, it seems totally nuts.<p>Translate it to literacy then. Should everybody be a prolific author or an avid reader? No, it&#x27;s okay if they&#x27;re not. Should everybody have the option, the basic ability to? Yes, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was considered a human right, or implied by human rights. It&#x27;s not okay for people to be unable to read, just like poverty is not okay. And what&#x27;s more, you don&#x27;t need to know about the chemistry of ink or paper to be literate, just like you don&#x27;t need to be able to solder a CPU from toothpicks to be computer literate. It&#x27;s all a matter of degree, with no hard lines, but still, I&#x27;m not happy to give up that easily on that much.<p>We already accepted that making a website is too hard for &quot;normal&quot; users, that just everything taking place in the equivalent of malls is fine, with people hardly interacting in private or public spaces, except for a bunch of wizards in ivory towers, and that is a shame and cannot stand. Especially since the poison of planned obsolescence has already permeated anything to do with computing; if &quot;normal&quot; people can&#x27;t create their own software and robots, it will not lead to better software and robots made by experts, it will lead to marketing departments shoveling regressing bloatware to people, ultimately. Yeah I&#x27;m exaggerating, too, this is FUD in a way, I know that... but I can&#x27;t help it, this is the one thing to do with computers that really gets to me. I can live with not everybody being a programmer, but I cannot live with not every programmer wishing everybody could program. Being able to make a static website is not even a tiny subset of that, but if I can&#x27;t even give up on general coding literacy, I can&#x27;t even <i>consider</i> giving up on general web literacy.<p>So while it&#x27;s totally silly to worry over the announcement of something when we don&#x27;t even, and that will be freely available to everyone, I absolutely love that so many brought this issue up! It does give me hope. But so far, Mozilla has brought me nothing but joy, so I&#x27;m not anxious. Whatever it is, it will be open source, right? Right :D Anyone from Mozilla reading this, you guys rock.<p>TL;DR: I had a dream of a world where the words &quot;developer&quot; and &quot;user&quot; were out of use, just like &quot;free citizen&quot; as distinction to the default case of slave or woman is out of use today (well okay, those problems are also not overcome, but at least there is a consensus amongst smart people that they should be).",1415062378

A typical system configuration would be to boot the generic kernel, edit the configuration file to select only those devices and features that were going to be used, config and then make that kernel. Then boot from the configured kernel from then on.<p>There has been both a lot of research and debate about various &#x27;microkernel&#x27; strategies where the core of the micro-kernel really only knows how to access the boot disk and load modules. Then as hardware is probed and discovered, modules to support that hardware is loaded.<p>As a desktop machine kernel, micro-kernels allow for changes in the hardware configuration to occur fairly easily without a lot of user visible fuss. But they do leave open the vulnerability that the module system can be exploited. Server systems generally change less frequently and hardware changes beyond adding or removing a disk drive are often quite rare.<p>Things are always trade-offs.<p>I wonder if there is anyone doing mixed virtualization studies. Using a hypervisor that is locked down for the lower layer and then booting the &quot;user&quot; machine for interactive use.

Not being able to inspect objects inline in the console is very annoying. Is there no &quot;clear network log&quot; button? No option to retain/not retain the network log on page loads? I want a way to view an element that got logged to the console in the DOM inspector (Chrome has: context menu -> show in DOM inspector). I want an auto-completion menu in the style editor in the DOM editor. And there seems to be no way to search in a script as shown in the debugger. That&#x27;s such a basic function, it really makes me wonder. I want a reload menu like in Chrome, where with open inspector I can choose between &quot;normal reload&quot;, &quot;hard reload&quot; and &quot;clear cache and reload&quot;.<p>In Chrome&#x27;s console I like that I simply can write the function name and press enter to see it&#x27;s source. In Firefox I have to write &quot;String(functionname)&quot;. That&#x27;s only a minor thing. The best thing would be to get the function source expandable inline similar to what you can do with objects in Chrome&#x27;s console. There should also be a link that lets you jump to the definition of the function in the JavaScript source.<p>There is no resource tab in Firefox. Basically I want exactly the resource tab from Chrome, with a list of all loaded images, scripts, styles etc., grouped by their origin. I want to see and be able to edit/remove all cookies, local storage, session storage etc.<p>You can&#x27;t select a certain iframe as the context of the console, which makes it completely useless when you have to debug iframe based widgets.<p>I just had the case where the debugger statement starts the debugger but it did not focus on the source line where it occurs, because the debugger request the script <i>again</i> instead of showing the already loaded resource and the script was generated as a response to a POST request.<p>I don&#x27;t use Firefox for debugging anymore (unless it&#x27;s a Firefox specific bug I have to fix) so I don&#x27;t quite remember the next bit: There where some kind of big annoyances concerning debugging and exceptions which are caught anyway. I could not get it to &quot;halt on exception&quot; but not on those that are caught.<p>That&#x27;s all I can think of right now, but I&#x27;m sure I forgot something.<p>But granted, it is always getting better. Maybe some day it is as good as the Chrome Inspector. There is one point where it (or Firefox) is better: Error messages. They are much less cryptic and show the source line of the error. It says things along the lines of &quot;in foo.bar foo has no method bar&quot; instead of &quot;undefined is not a function&quot;. Also a rethrown exception retains the original source line, which is very useful.<p>Firefox&#x27;s font inspector is nice. I hadn&#x27;t had a use for it yet, but I can imagine to have one some day.<p>In course of writing this comment I looked at the Firefox development tools again and a lot of things got indeed much better since the last time I looked.<p>OT: There are also a lot of things that annoy me about Chrome: Since many month now Linux integration got extremely worse. They dropped gtk for their own thing and screwed up big time in doing so. Context menus look totally alien and have no shadow, tooltips (title attribute) look alien and are no real windows (they get cropped, which makes them useless in certain contexts), there are lots of graphical glitches, e.g. when dragging stuff (white bg of the dragged image/text and for the drop marker arrow in the tab bar) and the scrollbars got the brain dead Windows behavior that not even IE uses anymore. IE implemented it&#x27;s own scrollbars, apparently. Other scrollbars in Windows (and in Chrome) jump around and stop working when you drag the scrollbar and move the mouse an unknown invisible distance from the scrollbar. Oh and dragging tabs got unusable bad in Chrome. It&#x27;s a complete disaster. The tabs aren&#x27;t transparent but full sized when you drag them and you can&#x27;t drag them down so the bottom border of the window gets outside of the screen, which makes it impossible to drag a tab to a different window that is located down in relation to the window you ripped the tab out of. And sometimes tabs move at an offset form where you grabbed them. WTF? There was a time where Chrome looked less of an alien under Linux than Firefox. Not anymore. Firefox didn&#x27;t get any better, Chrome got much worse. At least you can use the mouse wheel on the tabs. That is something it does better than Firefox. And the tab size handling when closing tabs one after another. But enough of that.",1415061865

WaPo is critical of VAMs and then they use a state-to-classroom comparison to show that she is effective? Doing better or worse than the state average is just about the <i>worst</i> measure of teachers performance. Entire school districts tend to perform well mainly as a measure of how well-to-do that school district is.<p>This is excaltly the comparisoin VAMs are trying to prevent.

There is a lot of <i>really</i> depressing stuff there.<p>Implementing low level cryptographic algorithms is hard - I&#x27;d say near impossible to get right - if you apply high standards like side-channel resistance. There are a lot of use cases though, where side-channel resistance is not necessary to get secure &quot;enough&quot; against the slightly above average attacker. But the next level to get wrong is using the low-level crypto correctly. E.g. by assuming encrypting data is enough to protect the content, until you find out about CBC padding oracles and how <i>your service</i> involuntarily decrypts the sensitive date for the attacker (ASP.net: [1]). Or you realize, that your ad-hoc message authentication code does not protect your API at all, because MD5, SHA1 and the SHA2 family are all subject to length extension attacks (Flickr: [2]).<p>The subtleties are endless: In RSA, you can calculate the `e`th root over the real numbers, if `e` and the message is small, RSA has it&#x27;s own padding problems [3], Stream ciphers provide no authenticity whatsoever as you can just xor the ciphertext with any value to manipulate the plaintext, password hashing is not at all about what most people believe it to be, comparing passwords should be done using a PAKE [4] (otherwise you can bruteforce passwords, like in WPA)... And then there is stuff that even the experts get wrong, think TLS Triple Handshake [5].<p>You can learn about this kind of stuff by reading the right books (I like to recommend &quot;Cryptography Engineering&quot; [6]) and keeping an eye open for vulnerabilities and how they work, so it is not obscure or hidden knowledge. But building cryptographic systems involves a lot more work and expert knowledge than the average programmer in the upper quartile imagines.

In fact, I more often find people who will either offer to help, and don&#x27;t, or are so self-absorbed that they can&#x27;t stop talking about how great/impressive they or their startup is without bothering to ask about you or what you&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;ve even asked for a meeting with and gotten the following response: &quot;I&#x27;m very busy. Let me know how you think you can help me and I&#x27;ll think about it.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to tell myself that it&#x27;s just my luck: That it&#x27;s not socio-economic or pedigree based (race or school) or that some people here don&#x27;t have basic people skills and don&#x27;t know how to carry on a conversation. That maybe it&#x27;s just the luck of the draw that I run into more people that I&#x27;d classify as &quot;ass holes&quot; than not, but I&#x27;m coming--very late--to a sad reality: it <i>is</i> about socio-economic status--even more than that, it <i>is</i> about pedigree (yes, both race and the school you went to). It <i>is</i> about manners--most people don&#x27;t have them. AND, it&#x27;s about gender as well! I&#x27;m not a woman, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that if I was a woman, things would be a shit ton harder for me than they already are. I&#x27;m not a 20-something white male that went to Stanford and it&#x27;s impossible for me to imagine how hard things would be if I had a vagina [0].<p>These are things we don&#x27;t want to talk about. Thank god a conversation about gender is taking place, but there&#x27;s another conversation about elitism and race that hasn&#x27;t even started yet.<p>> &quot;One of the biggest misconceptions about us is that you need to have pre-existing connections to get value from the network.&quot;<p>Complete and utter bull. Maybe in Sam&#x27;s world, sure! White? 20-something? No-kids? Harvard/Stanford? B2C? Let’s chat!<p>Early-40&#x27;s/Late-30&#x27;s? Not-white? Married w/ kids? Not-Harvard/Stanford? B2B? Nope. (Don&#x27;t bother to apply to YC either).<p>The reason Silicon Valley works is because there&#x27;s a new-boys <i>network</i> that helps out those that check most of the right boxes.\nBut here’s the good news: There are other networks. Networks of people in their 40’s. Networks of people that are from a specific ethnic group. Networks of people that went to the same (non-Harvard/Stanford) business school as you that <i>are</i> willing to help out. Are most of these networks as big and powerful as the circles Sam roles in? Absolutely not. But are they out there? Yes. One of the marvels of Silicon Valley is that because there are so many people out here, there’s a semi-decent chance you might find someone in one of these networks that will meet you for a coffee, offer to help, and try to make something happen for you. Is it likely? No, but possible, yes? And that—the possibility of something working out despite the odds—is what entrepreneurship is about. \n[0] - What It&#x27;s Like Raising Money As A Woman In Silicon Valley (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/08/07/what-its-like-raising-money-as-a-woman-in-tech/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/08/07/what-it...</a>)",1415060609

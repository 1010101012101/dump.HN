73718,comment,73112,73464,0,0,brl,,,"> Why not doing it in the first place, then?<p>We don't want to do it at all and probably never would.  I'm only mentioning it as something that somebody evaluating risks from the other side might imagine that we could do.<p>> If the internals are not well-designed and not well-documented, yes. In that case, once again, why bother releasing the source code?<p>No, we're not going to deliberately obfuscate anything because that would be against our goals of encouraging as many people as possible to adopt our platform.<p>I think it's not really necessary to create artificial obstacles for us to have an important advantage.  Very large systems take time and experience to understand even when they are both well designed and well documented.<p>Linus and Alan Cox have an advantage over newcomers at extending the Linux kernel, right?  Hypothetically, if Linus, Alan, and say Rusty Russell got together and created a startup to implement a Linux kernel based idea, would it make sense to compete against them on exactly that idea?<p><p>",1193649584

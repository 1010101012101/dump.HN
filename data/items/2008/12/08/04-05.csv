I think the point is that the investors need enough equity to have a good upside (50x $) and the company needs to maintain enough equity to be motivated (the majority).<p>So, if you are shooting for the fences, how much do you think the company can be worth in 5 years?  What percentage will give the angel 50x their investment?<p>I am looking forward to what others have to say.",1228712113

389483,story,,,5,3,anonyreliant,"Ask HN: valuing a non-existent company",,"Hi guys. Occasional commenter posting anonymously. We are in an interesting situation and I would appreciate advice.<p>Our core business is in a niche area, but we have the opportunity to get some angel funding to enter a related but much larger market. We are planning to enter this market in the long run anyway. Moving now would provide some risk diversification, give us the cash to cover upfront costs and provide some miscellaneous administrative support. Also first mover advantage. The business model would be validated early, or fail early. We'll know in a few thousand dollars so it isn't really high risk.<p>We could take this step on our own, but we're bootstrapping and can't afford to split our resources to support two products. So the advantage is really avoiding a delay of at least six to eight months. There is no risk of dilution to our existing business, so that is not a concern.<p>The question is how to value an angel investment in a business like this where there is a small initial investment for market testing and an agreement for how to move forward if it makes sense. To me this means figuring out a reasonable value for our own contribution. But what is that? The costs of building the tech side from scratch? The opportunity cost of the people who need to manage/execute? Does the market value of our labor even matter if we are taking equity?<p>I understand that the answer is always ""we need more details"", but it is hard to do that without being overly specific. Apologies for being obtruse. I'd appreciate hearing about any relevant factors that came into play in any similar agreements any of you have run into.",1228710245

Most articles about Facebook seem to be written by people who are mystified by its appeal, its users, and the broader changes in technology and society that are enabling its success.<p>Perhaps this is explained somewhere later in the article, but this bullet point confused me:<p>""Giving users 'ownership' over the information they enter on Facebook is the worst idea of all; it empowers them to run roughshod over others' privacy.""<p>How would giving ownership over the information a user enters on Facebook empower that user to run roughshod over others' privacy?

It's not a magic built-in function, it's just a constructor for type float.  Same with int and str.  I can't say there's anything wrong with Ruby's int.to_f, but I actually like the Python design better.<p>Now, as far as len() goes, I agree.  It's easy to forget about such troubles, but I definitely wasted a good 10 minutes when I was learning Python trying to figure out what property or method of type list (or str--I don't remember) I should use to get its length.",1228709468

The manufactured pot would need to be priced higher (to pay for the production equipment over a reasonable depreciation period) in comparison to the hand produced pot that incurs no such overhead to produce, just cheap labor.  So in effect, yes, a manufactured pot would be more than a hand produced pot.<p>I do think the commenter confused the matter by including imported items in the argument.<p>Given unlimited future earnings, you are right that a manufactured product may be cheaper to produce since there's much less labor cost, but in all practicality I'm not sure it applies.",1254765489

Getting people to stop whatever it is they are doing and use your product is impossible at least 90% of the time. I know this because it has happened to me several times.<p>So here is one advise I would like to share with startups: build a product that does not require users to come to your website. In other words, do not change your end users' current behaviors. The best way to do this is to integrate with the applications they are already using. One application that is common to all internet users is Email. We all go it. If your audience can make use of your product by simply sending an email then you are ahead of the curve. Doubt it? Ask Posterous, CCBetty, or Snoozemail. So if you are readying to build a CRM app, or Search engine etc.. figure how to make it work from Email or IM or similar products others have already accepted.<p>Edit: And in regards to CRM, what small businesses really need is not a light version of SalesForce, its a product that can make sense of forwarded emails.",1254765381

For instance, travel ideas would go well with a travel web site, Amazon already does a bit of this for books and so on.<p>Though that's just basic recommendations.  Part of the problem is that ""out of their comfort zone"" implies a significant likelihood of not liking the activity or object.  Part of the problem is distinguishing risky attempts (""I didn't expect to like this, but it was awesome!"") from plain old bad ideas (""yeah, this sucks.  I kind of expected it to."")<p>It'd probably be hard to get people to keep coming back to an ""expand your horizons"" web site that did nothing but collect data and recommend stepping outside their comfort zone -- most people don't want to spend all their time outside their comfort zone, and most people only do a few things that are particularly hard for them, so they don't have a lot of data to give you offhand.<p>It seems like there must be somewhere that people are already collecting this data, I just don't know <i>where</i> it is, or what gimmick you could use to get it from people.

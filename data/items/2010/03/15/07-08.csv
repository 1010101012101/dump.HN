My main focus there isn't that we equate the two, it's that there's such a <i>strong</i> connection.  At least, as far as I can see.  It could've grown from ""that sells better, what if we do this"", but it's still kinda strange, and I wonder if it's at least partly intentional.<p>'Tis just speculation, though.

Given that, having a longer more thorough process may not be beneficial. At best a long process can reduce the number of failures by refusing to invest in them but it will never increase the number of successes which is limited by the number of people who ask you funding.<p>I'm kind of surprised that no well funded VC funds have come up with the idea of just handing out 5-10k to every single not obviously doomed startup they come across in exchange for a few percent of each company. They could call it shotgun investing.",1268639837

You were just lucky to have no tzars, no WW on your territory, and, the most important point - no communism.<p>Communism degrades social trust, in Poland before the WWII we had very cultured and organised population, people were helping each other, etc. We had regained independence after over 100 years.<p>Even 5 years into the WWII, there were uprising in Warsaw, many young people died for Poland, others were fighting in the England, Italy, on the far east.<p>In the first 10 years of communism everybody that were active as partisant during the war were either in the jail, killed, has escaped from the country, or vere hiding in the forests. Then, communistic gov said if the remains of Armia Krajowa uncover, there will be now more killing. And of course they lied, like many times before and after that.<p>After 45 years of communism people in Poland still don't trust each other. People are still gaming the system, current gov aren't helping, at least they are elected in honest elections.

When I was in the auto industry it certainly looked very bleak - I've since lost touch with most of the people from that time, but I doubt it's looking up now either.<p>One of our chief problems when I was working in the auto supplier industry was relentless cost cutting on the part of the major manufacturers (GM was especially bad in this department) - and from what we knew GM certainly wasn't pocketing the difference, all of the cost cutting went directly into hyper-competitive consumer pricing.<p>As a result our cars are <i>dirt, dirt</i> cheap, unsustainably so, especially if your goal is to keep manufacturing jobs on this side of the ocean. But it's not as if people know this - especially the type like the author of the article, who like to play the victim constantly by making vague straw-man references to the greedy corporation.<p>I cannot count the number of times I've heard people make the point that some product ""probably costs nothing to make anyways"" - and it bothers me greatly. For just about everything except the high fashion industry, manufacturing costs are not that far divorced from their retail cost... but consumers who believe this hogwash are also liable to believe that outsourcing is due to rampant greed, as opposed to <i>their</i> unquenchable desire for cheap crap.",1268639419

The economic position of the state prior to their transition away from communism absolutely has an effect on how they managed after the transition.<p>I'd be willing to guess that while part of the Soviet Union and under a planned economy, whatever the Estonian state was responsible for was closer to being services-based and processing raw materials after they were obtained.

Airports are shopping centers, where they want people to stay and buy things.  The longer you stay at airports the more you spend.  That is an incentive to have you at airports longer.  Whereas many train stations do not have that set-up (although that is changing!).  The eurostar used to be easier, because the station at the london end did not have a long way to walk past lots of shops.  Now, at the new station there are lots of shops to walk past before you can leave.  Still quite nice though in comparison to flying out of gatwick on easy jet ;)<p>I love trains.  Been on them from 30 hour trips across Australia, to the bullet trains in Japan, ones across Germany, France, the Netherlands, China and ones across the UK.  Always wanted to do some long trips across china, russia and india... guess I better hurry up before those trains are replaced!<p>It will be great when the fast networks of europe are joined to the fast networks of asia.",1268638779

But, I know that if I commit to something, I expect my co-founder to also be committed to it (within the bounds of what we've agreed upon). Working on other projects now and then is fine and normal...it's what hackers do. But, if you've committed to build a business with someone, it's not really the idea that makes the business. It's the combined effort and execution of the team. So, splitting your time between building your ""private business"" and your ""co-founded business"", and then taking off when the private business has some bit of success, is probably not what an honest business person would do. If you don't believe in the co-founded business idea, anymore, you talk it over with your co-founder, and you try to fix the problem.<p>But, shit happens. If you give up your equity in the co-founded startup, apologize for flaking, etc. then I guess you've done the best you can. I wouldn't expect the co-founder to ever be willing to do business with you again, but it's probably not what I would call ""treacherous"", either. I think the story of Evan Williams and Blogger (and Odeo/Twitter, for that matter, maybe even moreso) would sound kind of similar when told by different involved parties, and we don't consider Evan treacherous.<p>Then again, we are talking about <i>one week later</i>. He <i>had</i> to know that he had other irons in the fire and probably wouldn't be involved in the company much longer. So, yeah, this actually does sound kinda nasty.",1268636663

Using ""scuttle"" makes it seems like a rather whimsical take on one of the more important events of the 1990's. If anyone doesn't know what he's referring to, its the KGB and other branches of the Soviet government taking himself (Gorbachev) hostage and throwing a coup. In turn, Boris Yeltsin led protests to restore Gorbachev to power.<p>Due to his actions, Yeltsin gained popular support and was, in effect, the leader of the Soviet Union as the president of Russia; Gorbachev had resigned a few days after the coup. And the Soviet Union was nearing its end as well; it ceased to exist just over four months later.",1268636558

For one thing, outsourcing would've happened whether we liked it or not. For another, having worked in manufacturing for a bit, corporations by and large aren't laughing their way to the bank by outsourcing American manufacturing jobs overseas - the cost of their goods drop proportionally with labour savings, in the mid-to-long haul anyhow.<p>I like how we're blaming this on everyone but ourselves - the outsourcing of manufacturing to cheap nations has allowed us to develop a rampant, disgusting consumer culture that has an almost fetishist obsession with cheap, shoddy goods. <i>WE</i> did that to ourselves. Believe me, if there was any significant demand in this country for expensive, well-made products we can bring a great number of manufacturing jobs back... but I suspect the Wal-Mart mentality is here to stay, and there's no one to blame for this but ourselves.",1268636557

4691252,comment,4689364,4689930,25,0,jsz0,,,"I think it will be a huge success for Apple. I know a lot of folks want to believe Apple's success has just been some amazing fluke thus must end soon but there's really no indication out there the market has changed much since the original iPod. Apple keeps running the same play over and over again because it works. It's very clever. Apple positions their products to be affordable luxuries. This is mostly expressed through the device's design but also because Apple protects their brands very carefully. There is no cheap iPad -- there's a thinner and lighter iPad that happens to cost less.<p>Psychologically this is interesting because Apple is pulling at a lot of strings here. They want consumers to feel good about buying the product. Not resentful it's not the thing they <i>really</i> wanted but couldn't afford. Part of it is almost Pavlovian. The customer pays more but in the process is rewarded in different ways. For having the taste to pick the perceived superior brand for example. It's an item coveted by others, again if only because it's perceived to be superior, and it's an item that broadcasts it's premium price tag like a badge of honor with a striking design. The customer enjoys the experience of everyone swooning over their new purchase. They like the idea thousands of people are waiting in line to get this thing they are holding in their hands right now. This is even more important in the context of giving Apple products as gifts. Buying someone the cheap but acceptable option sends one message. Buying someone the expensive and also acceptable option sends a different message.<p>Basically Apple cracked the code of getting people to pay more <i>and</i> be pretty happy about it.",1351043028

They're certainly improving, but we run into bugs and missing core language features in all three major vendors.  I work for a consulting company, and we switch simulators and coding styles from one gig to another, so that may amplify my perception of bugginess.  But just as examples, in the last couple of years, my coworkers and I have discovered:<p>- a case where one simulator gets the xor of a two-state and a four-state logic vector <i>wrong</i>.<p>- a case where another simulator converts from 4-state to 2-state value with the wrong result.<p>- one of the simulators doesn't implement a single-precision floating point type<p>Those are pretty fundamental bugs - not the class of bug I expect to find in a tool that has been in the wild for 5 or 6 years and costs more than my car for a single one-year license.

If they had come in around $249 to $279 they could have still sent all the right signals about this being superior to the competition. However, at that price point they would have really impacted their $499 iPad. I believe Apple left a big hole for competition to thrive in because of the fear of impacting the larger iPad. Two reasons: Apple admits that the main usage for a tablet is surfing the web and checking email. A Nexus 7 does that just fine. Secondly, Nexus 7 will improve significantly from the 1st gen it is - Apple's given them plenty of breathing room to bump the specs and sell a higher end device at $299 and even $329 price.

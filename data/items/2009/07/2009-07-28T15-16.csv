728097,comment,727657,727913,0,0,ajross,,,"It's actually not a vulnerability in isolation.  The use of SELinux simply changes the address space policy from one in which the kernel enforces the zero page area to one in which the process can map stuff there (by default, unless the security module turns it off).  By itself, that does nothing.<p>There were other holes that had to be there too: the handler code was incorrectly dereferencing a pointer before the check for null (that's a real bug), <i>and</i> the compiler was optimizing out the null pointer test in the same function (a really, really subtle interaction that no one expected) that would have detected the attack and returned an error instead.<p>It's a perfect storm of coincidence, basically.  There's nothing the NSA could have done to predict this, and the SELinux part is only a small piece.   And in any case, the security policy bug isn't even in the NSA's SELinux code at all, it's in the way the kernel sets defaults for its security policies for any security module.  In principle, app-armor would be vulnerable to the same issue (not sure if it is or not to this one specifically).",1248796570

The behavior specified by this plist value is meant for daemon processes. Google is using it because they run daemon processes for the window renderers in Chrome. The daemons need some of the Cocoa application stuff to render things like form inputs with native widgets, so they have to use some 'real' (NSApplication) Cocoa application stuff to get that that, which normally creates a dock icon for you (instead of just running a UNIX process.) This Info.plist value suppresses that behavior, along with the dock icon bounce and some other important stuff.<p>The author then goes on to ignore his own advice, and shows us demoing the trick in his own application.",1248793885

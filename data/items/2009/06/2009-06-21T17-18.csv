I've got a good education, a respectable resume, a terrible GPA, and few peer networking contacts (I found people in my program to be boring, so didn't hang out with them). I also can't find a job; most companies that I get through to say - truth or not - that they're in a hiring freeze for the next six months.<p>I mentioned that I've got no in-industry peer networking contacts, but I have a few very good ones in politics.

It would be a year of traveling around the country with them, likely including an election, and would be incredibly exciting.<p>My worry is this: if I take this job for a year, will I be aged-out of most positions when I get back? I'm currently a little over 26, and if I do this for a year, would be 27 and a bit when I would be done. Going back into tech/software at that point, I worry that I would be over the normal age for a junior developer position, but would lack the professional experience to be hired as an intermediate one.<p>I'd like to take this ops job, but worry that I'd be somewhat screwing over my future career.

667538,comment,667411,667447,0,0,russell,,,"I am going to argue with you sideways. :-) I dont think Hello Health is an argument for HSA's so much as a streamlined reimbursement system with some kind or reasonable accountability for costs.  The current structure optimizes for assembly line medicine rather than good patient care.  Most people go with factory doctors, because of the small co-pay.  You can go to a doctor outside your plan, but you typically get only 50% reimbursement.  My doctor costs me $100 out of pocket instead of $25, but she is worth it because I get a one-hour appointment instead of 15 minutes.<p>On to Milton Friedman.  He makes a very good case for single payer health insurance (11% of GDP vs 17%) and then comes to the opposite conclusion.  He is drinking the perfect market koolaid.  He assumes that, if people have to pay their own money, they are going to make rational economic decisions about health care purchases and will shop around for the best price.  This is such utter crap that it is hard to believe that an open minded economist would utter it.  Health purchases are not rationally economic.  They are made on other considerations like trust in the doctor and increasingly on patient evaluations of treatment options.  If you have a kid with a high fever, you dont start googling for the best price.<p>A part of the conservative economic fantasy is that consumers have negotiating power in the market.  Yes, I by drugs at Costco because they are cheaper, but that is because Costco has negotiating advantage, not me.  A single payer would have a huge advantage in negotiating drug prices.  There is a reason that drug prices in the US are the highest in the world.<p>Health care reform in the US is hugely complicated and a simplistic approach is not going to cut it, even a single payer system isnt enough.  Drug costs need to be cut.  Defensive medicine needs to be brought in line.  (Practice to the patients needs not the doctors.)  On and on.  Hello Health looks to be a good start in the microcosm.",1245605507

667519,comment,667346,667359,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Not sure where to put my reply, but this place seems okay. Write your own resume - when I started college and was looking for internships, I relied heavily on ""professionals"" (resume writers and critiquers in the school's career services department) as well as the advice of numerous people who never seemed to have trouble finding jobs.<p>I still got no interviews. It wasn't until I decided to really think through the logic of resume reading and writing that I finally settled on my own style that, in my final internship in college, scored me 15 interviews in 2 weeks.<p>You sound like you have plenty of experience but are failing  at getting noticed. This is not a bad position (beats the opposite: lots of attention on paltry skill set). A couple basic pointers I've found useful:<p>- make it look different. I use a sans-serif font unlike most people, who go for the elegant, professional serif fonts. I also throw my name is large bold letters at the top (much bigger than most templates would tell you).<p>- make your way past HR. Many recruiters in HR only scan for keywords, not being devs themselves. Cater to their whims by starting off with a litany of keywords. I start my resume with a large (but well spaced) list of languages, major libraries, databases, etc. I have gone to many interviews where the only thing highlighted on my resume were from the keyword section.<p>- whitespace. So many people adhere strictly to the one-page (or two-page) rule, and somehow think this is license to cram the page. If your resume is a chore to read, it wont' get read. Give lots of spacing - information density has an upper limit before the brain gives up.<p>As for job searching in general, I've found the following useful for both internships and post-college first-job situations:<p>- Find the name of the recruiter. Have no shame in doing this, especially at large companies. A good way in that I'm fond of using is thinking hard about the position, and coming up with (good, non-obvious) questions that you may have about the job. Then, hit up the company and don't stop until you've reached the recruiter-in-charge and had your questions answered. This shows enthusiasm, initiative, and most of all your name is now anchored - which greatly increases your odds of making it into the ""interview"" pile (or get rescued from the ""trash"" pile after the fact).<p>- Once you have the recruiter's name, write a personalized cover letter with your resume. Use the recruiter's name. This will stand out greatly amongst the sea of ""Dear Recruiter"" lines, or even no cover letter at all.<p>- Go to career fairs. Your odds of success increase dramatically if the recruiter can tie your resume to a face. If there is some spark of recognition you will likely end up in the ""interview"" pile. Don't just make smalltalk at these things, genuinely try to grok what the company does, ask intelligent questions to both engineers and HR, and make an impression.",1245604721

Agreed that it successful in many other countries like Canada, UK and France but if you look closer there are a lot of factors that will work against universal health care being successful in the United States.

We also have a new immigrant population every year. We also have the most expensive form of health care thanks to the system that rewards bad doctors.

Which is fine with me if I knew that it would work but these issues that I stated above cannot be solved by throwing in more money.

I call B.S.<p>His comment about Physicians earning much less in Canada than in the U.S. is also disingenuous.  Canadian doctors spend the vast majority of their 40-hour workweek being doctors.  In the U.S. doctors have to deal with both patients and insurance companies equally, raising the time they spend working and lowering the overall efficiency of providing care.<p>Besides, lawyers also make much less in Canada than in the U.S., as do senior executives.  Is this also because of the health care system?<p>I like his thesis.  I find it elegant and simple.  It's too bad that any time he approached presenting a real fact in the article he did so dishonestly.",1245604276

In our democracy, politicians are committed public servants who universally put the long-range well-being of the republic ahead of their own political interest. In this way we benefit from their wisdom, shown time and again to be superior to that of conventional public opinion, having carefully weighed and integrated the best ideas from leaders in every field.<p></sarcasm><p>Seriously, do you think that the US today is a free market? I challenge you to show me one area of endeavor that's not subject to government regulation.<p>The history of health insurance is completely dependent on government meddling. In the past, people were not dependent on their employers or any public assistance for healthcare. It was generally funded by the patients themselves, with help from mutual-aid organizations like churches and unions.<p>It was FDR's socialist wage freezes that forced companies to find other ways to compete for the most talented employees (the market always finds a way, despite government interference[1]). The way the income tax worked, offering healthcare benefits was advantageous. Thus, the government warped the existing market and changed the expectations of people. Now employees gripe that employees are greedy by not paying more and more for medical coverage -- but their offering any coverage at all is a very recent development.<p>[1] This is pretty much always true. Why do people drive gas-sucking SUVs today? Because CAFE regulations in the '70s killed the family station wagon, but exempted cars. People want big vehicles, and found a way around the regulations. And the work-around was worse than what we had initially.",1245603823

Are people here really so bad at statistics that they think this?<p>Example: Just because the average rainfall in a spot is 10 inches, does NOT mean it has to be 10 inches every year. If you have 6 inches one year that is NOT an anomaly. That is perfectly normal. Sure it might be unlikely - but unlikely things still happen! In fact they must happen, just not as often at the more likely things.<p>So the analysis of the votes, sure it might not match the average, but that doesn't mean a whole lot. It could simply mean that you happened to get the 10% chance.<p>PS. Not that the vote fraud is in question. It's not, it's obviously fake. But not because of this analysis.",1245603732

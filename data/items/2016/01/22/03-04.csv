There is nothing &quot;lightweight&quot; about JVM threads; they are standard native threads on normal platforms and on Linux a thread context switch has roughly the same performance overhead as a process context switch. (There is a difference, and if you study the kernel source I&#x27;m sure you can divine it, but you will also quickly realize that it is a rounding error compared to the first cache eviction of the new context.) The memory overhead of a process in Linux is literally measured in tens of kilobytes.<p>I also suggest you look into preforking and copy-on-write and ensure that you are clear on how Linux works with regards to memory usage; modern Linux systems indeed do not necessitate &quot;burning RAM&quot; to use multiple processes (indeed, the fork paradigm is the standard Unix approach for a reason, it only makes sense to make it performance-friendly). I would also note that while a Ruby or a Python can do this, Java, in standard configurations, cannot, were one to desire the ability to do so (and I&#x27;ve had reasons to run JVM applications in a multiprocess mode before).<p>I don&#x27;t dislike Java, don&#x27;t get me wrong.

First of all, as you mention, there&#x27;s a Bamboo Ceiling problem.  Secondly, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that blacks and latinos are underrepresented.  Diversity is good because it provides a broader range of perspectives, and it helps correct for historical injury.  Having a ton of asians helps a little in those two areas, but clearly there&#x27;s still huge room for improvement.  Thirdly, you&#x27;re allowing our small privileges be used as a wedge.  The implication is that blacks and latinos should just work harder like asians if they want to be in SV, which is classic model minority bullshit.  We need solidarity between minority groups, not division.  It&#x27;s true that other minority groups don&#x27;t care enough about asian issues, but that&#x27;s a reason that we all have to do better, not an excuse for us asians to be worse.<p>> who the hell helped me as an Asian man?<p>The Civil Rights Movement was instrumental in the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.  Literally, we wouldn&#x27;t be allowed in the United States without the help of everyone from the Civil Rights era.<p>Academic work about microaggressions and racism owe a lot to black thinkers and the black experience.  The condition of the million or so undocumented asian americans goes hand in hand with the struggles of undocumented latinos.  Blacks are spearheading the fight for media representation with stuff like #OscarsSoWhite.  We have to do the work to include ourselves in these fights, but other PoCs clearly are our allies.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m gonna leave you this article from a few months ago:<p><a href=""http://unhyphenate.me/2015/12/18/our-asian-america/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unhyphenate.me/2015/12/18/our-asian-america/</a>",1453433279

Yes, a completely rational actor will invest capital in whatever market is currently generating the highest rate of return. But people are not rational actors. More specifically, people tend to be extremely loss averse - they will go to far greater lengths to avoid a result of -$1 than they will go to achieve a result of +$1, even though the delta (a dollar either way) is exactly the same for both situations. This loss aversion only gets worse when you scale up the numbers to -$1,000,000 and +$1,000,000.<p>This is why higher levels of inequality are correlated with lower growth. Capital owning rentiers are entirely happy with a 2% (or less) rate of return, so long as the risk of a negative rate of return is negligible. Meanwhile entrepreneurs who can generate much higher rates of return (but with a correspondingly higher probability of negative returns) are starved for capital.",1453431973

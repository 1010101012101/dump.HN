7471691,comment,7470633,7470633,11,0,icambron,,,"I&#x27;ll just say it: Kickstarter is for suckers. When you give money to a project, you&#x27;re doing one of two things:<p>1. Making a donation to a company. [1]<p>2. Preordering something that hasn&#x27;t been built yet.<p>Doing 1 is silly, since you don&#x27;t really get anything in return. &quot;But it makes it more likely that this thing I want will happen!&quot; In some tiny marginal way, sure, but mostly it&#x27;s going to happen because other people donate (or fails to happen because they don&#x27;t). Don&#x27;t be the fool who tries to personally take on the collective action problem. And stop trying to make other people rich out of the goodness of your heart.<p>Of course, as the WSJ fails to make clear, most of Oculus&#x27;s Kickstarter money wasn&#x27;t straight-up donations; it was preorders of the Rift. That&#x27;s obviously not a donation, but it&#x27;s not a good idea either. As the buyer, you bear the risk that it never ships at all. &quot;But I&#x27;m compensated with a discount!&quot; Essentially, you&#x27;re making an investment in which your returns come in the form of future discounts on a product. Forget that you like the Oculus Rift for a second; is this a wise investment structure? If someone set up a VC company that did that instead of buying parts of companies, would you think that was smart? Did you do any kind of analysis that suggests this is actually works out to be a good investment? Do the potential returns even justify that analysis? Do you think of other consumer products this way, or only shiny electronic things?<p>Or to think about it a different way: imagine if someone set up a store that worked like this: you take your item to the counter, where they don&#x27;t actually let you buy the item. Instead what you can do is pay the price minus n% and then they roll this big roulette to decide whether you get the product (m% success rate). If you win you get to keep the product and if you lose it goes back on the shelf and they keep your money. To spice things up, they don&#x27;t tell you what n and m are either, just the price to play and whether you get the item. Now, it&#x27;s possible--though unknown--that m and n work out that you&#x27;re EV positive here. But would you really shop at that store? Especially when there&#x27;s another store next door that just sells you the same stuff at a known price (i.e. just buy the Rift when it comes out).<p>The fact of the matter is that you&#x27;re aren&#x27;t pre-buying the Rift on a rational basis. You&#x27;ve been convinced by clever marketing to shoulder risk for a company because it <i>seems cool and feels good</i>. Total sucker move. That probably explains why it tastes bitter when the company whose capital requirements you fronted rolls that into a $2 billion dollar acquisition.<p>[1] Maybe it&#x27;s not a company. Maybe it&#x27;s a cause you support like improving CoffeeScript or something. For those cases, I withdraw my objections.",1395809822
7471690,comment,7463624,7469549,1,0,EGreg,,,"Once again I am not saying what these companies did was legal. Google for example had an internal email instructing people to TURN AWAY APPLICANTS from Apple. That&#x27;s completely different than agreeing not to target them for solicitation.<p><i>This is about trying to keep an entire category of employees (the ones not currently seeking new opportunities) in the dark about market wages and conditions in an effort to hold down general employee wages.</i><p>No it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s easy to find the market salaries today, on glassdoor and other means. You have a very unrealistic opinion of workers if you think that they are &quot;in thee dark&quot; about publicly available information that&#x27;s easily obtainable until a recruiter finally calls them and informs them that they can get a slightly bigger salary (in fact taking 20% for themselves).<p>The way I see it is - you can instruct your HR to work only with recruiters, you can instruct the recruiters to not advertise on porn sites because you don&#x27;t want the reputation cost, and you can ask recruiters not to cold call a rival&#x27;s employees because you don&#x27;t want to bear the reprisal cost. This isn&#x27;t a cartel. A cartel is when you REFUSE TO OFFER a better deal than your competitors thanks to internal agreements. Here you offer whatever you want! You simply are judicious where you advertise it. That is not a cartel sorry. There is no price fixing.<p>You know if we&#x27;re going to take this to its logical conclusion, it should be illegal for companies to collude with recruiters and all applicants should be able to bypass a recruiter and apply directly to the company, asking for a 20% greater salary. But somehow many companies I know don&#x27;t accept such applications. Please tell me why they can collude and not compete with recruiters. Isn&#x27;t that a REAL cartel since their HR dept will NOT OFFER you a job unless you are referred through a middleman. The HR dept refuses to compete with the recruiter even if you did the work for them and applied! And even if you don&#x27;t agree this a cartel, it certainly imposes a 20% tax on the salaries of applicants.<p><i>It is clear that it distorts the market and holds down wages for employees.</i><p>No, regula market operation doesn&#x27;t distort a market, outside regulation distorts markets. Government regulation distorts markets.<p>It is also not clear that more successful poaching will drive up wages for employees. It is clear it drives up COSTS of hiring and training employees since poached employees make you start over, delay and cancel projects etc. This may very well lead companies to hire contractors instead or pass on the costs to their OTHER employees - the majority who werent poached successfully - in other ways.<p>So no it&#x27;s not clear what companies will do, this isn&#x27;t basic supply and demand.",1395809794

7471683,comment,7471532,7471532,11,0,programminggeek,,,"I personally find it absurd that there are such laws protecting car dealerships, but then again given the history of the industry, there does need to be some regulation. Where it seems to go wrong is the idea that a company couldn&#x27;t sell their product direct to consumer. It&#x27;s sort of like saying that Apple stores can&#x27;t exist and Apple has to sell everything via Best Buy, Target, and Wal-Mart. Somehow, it seems that is how the car dealership racket has been legislated.<p>There is probably some kind of middle ground where Tesla should be able to sell direct, while there should probably be a possibility of dealerships trying to cut a deal with Tesla.<p>The real quagmire of unintended consequences here seems to be in how trading 6500 factory jobs for however many thousand dealership jobs. I don&#x27;t know how it shakes out on either the jobs or tax income end for Texas, but whenever you are talking large change like this, the unintended consequences are usually worse than predicted in one direction or another.",1395809603

I learned about the DOS family by reading this book:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dissecting-DOS-Code-Level-Operating-System/dp/020162687X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Dissecting-DOS-Code-Level-Operating-Sy...</a><p>UnixV6 and the Lions&#x27; book come close, but Unix is still far more complex than DOS because of its multitasking, multiuser heritage. Early Unices may be within the realm of an average student to grasp, but things like the BSD and Linux kernels are orders of magnitude bigger and more complex, which means that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get down to the details when studying them and the best thing one can hope for is a high-level overview of the various subsystems and how they interact. DOS is simple enough that a single person can study the whole OS at the level of individual instructions (and write an OS similar to it).",1395808512

For years I used their router plus various WiFi bridges.<p>However, if Verizon knows your WiFi keys (from the router), it stands to reason they have total control over their routers--so putting your own WiFi behind Verizon&#x27;s router won&#x27;t help you if you&#x27;re looking for privacy.  Verizon can see your LAN through their router, even if you disable WiFi.<p>For this and many other reasons, a while back I pulled Cat6 from the ONT (optical network terminal--where the fiber comes into your home) to my office.  I&#x27;m using an ASUS RT-AC66U for a router.  I&#x27;m running DD-WRT on it instead of ASUS&#x27; firmware.<p>Unfortunately, all of their TV STBs need Internet (for the guide), and those can only get Internet via MoCA (i.e., Internet over cable TV coax).  (Also, various services Verizon offers will not work with the BYOD router setup.)  You can purchase MoCA bridges, but it was easier to just neuter the Verizon router and use it as a MoCA bridge (behind my router).  By doing so I am probably opening up my LAN to spyware again.  Then again, if the STBs are on your LAN, they could be spying on you as well.<p>I keep an eye on the STB traffic, but who really knows.<p>I think my next step will be to curtail, then discontinue FiOS&#x27; TV service.  Lately I seem to pay more for less (their STB interface is frozen in time, slow, and now has advertising to add insult to injury).  I think the equivalent or less money will buy sufficient entertainment from Internet streaming or digital downloads.  And as a bonus there&#x27;s less potential for Verizon LAN abuse from their STBs.",1395808508

6415094,comment,6414162,6415051,2,0,MichaelGG,,,"Well first off, if you have something that suits bytes well (for instance, I have compressed indexes that are base128 delta encoded values, so a byte* is good enough for that) - just use the normal malloc routines and call it a day.<p>For allocating managed objects on unmanaged heaps, you just need to read a bit about CLR internals. The object pointer (so the value of s in &quot;var s = &quot;hello&quot;) points to the start of the object data (IIRC). There&#x27;s a few words in front of that that provide the object type, as well as the sync block (kitchen sync). Arrays have their own little syntax, where they have a type indicator as well as the length.<p>You can just manually copy those by pinning an arbitrary object and grabbing a few bytes before it. Then you can write those values to arbitrary memory locations, and use that memory address as the value to put back into a managed object reference.<p>For APIs that need strings, arrays, or other simple heap-allocated objects, but are pure and just return (like, say, String.Split takes an array to hold splitter values), you might get some large wins by stack allocating them.<p>The parts of my app that were GC managed, the optimization mainly went into reducing the number of objects allocated - at high request rates, even a few measly objects here and there can easily add GC pressure and suck up CPU. (Although, I will say the CLR GC does pretty well with short lived objects.)<p>You can also use the freedom of memory access to do things like mutate a string, or to change the type of an array (say, from a byte[] to a long[]).<p>Another common trick is allocating large arrays of structs, then passing ints that &quot;point&quot; to the struct in question. This a: locks the structs in memory and avoids GC if the entire array is over 85K (it goes on the Large Object Heap), and second, you&#x27;re only passing a single int param, instead of a struct, which can be slow for larger structs.",1379634789

London taxies are pretty tall (6ft easily) and there is no chance of being able to see over a London bus! It is a fairly common thing to think of Europeans countries as driving tiny, economical cars. However that isn&#x27;t nearly as applicable in London as elsewhere in the UK and much of the rest of Europe.<p>The congestion charge for driving into central London is prohibitively expensive such that only those people who can afford it, driving almost SUV sized range rovers, or those who make a living from it driving vans, taxis or buses do it.<p>Our cities and road networks have evolved around streets and roads dating back to Roman times. They are rarely straight, often narrow and heavily congested. We have no concept of jaywalking and our pedestrian population universally appears to have a death wish.<p>The quality of driving in the UK in general is reasonably high, though I find it more variable in London possibly due to the number of foreign drivers.<p>Driver attitude to motorcyclists is interesting. Generally most allow us to get on with it, some are actively helpful and a small percentage attempt to stop you getting through. The last group generally don&#x27;t succeed for long, even if I do have to get a little creative!<p>That being said, the average speed of traffic through rush hour London is 12mph so it&#x27;s easy to see why skipping to the front of a few queues makes a big difference!",1379633868

That also means we can&#x27;t easily extract it from anything--you have to extract everything else until only helium remains. This is a ridiculously expensive process.<p>The large underground domes that trapped natural gas in Texas also trapped the helium that resulted from millennia of radioactive decay within the Earth. Getting helium from that sort of a deposit is comparatively inexpensive.<p>In the early 20st century, we believed helium airships were going to become important military weapons, and we started to stock pile helium as a strategic reserve--Texas natural gas producers were mandated to extract the helium and give it to the government for storage and eventual military use rather than vent it into the atmosphere.<p>Later we got airplanes, and airships became a thing of the past like dodos. And since we had a large store of helium, it was available for research and science and balloons. Cool things developed. For MR this meant high-fields generated by superconducting magnets.<p>But of course maintaining a large stockpile of helium is also expensive. And what does the public know about helium? Why are we wasting our money on balloons and funny voices and besides if scientists say it&#x27;s important, then it must be the devil&#x27;s plaything.<p>So along came the Gingrich-era House and the Contract with America. Congress stopped the economically-crushing over-bearing regulatory burden of helium trapping that was crushing Texas&#x27;s natural gas competitiveness.<p>Congress also decided to simultaneously make a few bucks by selling of the helium reserve at cut rate prices, killing any chance of economic incentives developing a secondary market for helium. You can&#x27;t simultaneously cut funding for science and jack up the prices of helium, that would be one straw too far! Thus the large US reserve was to be sold off at very low prices.<p>Texas natural gas producers thereby had little incentive to catch the helium themselves as they plowed through the easy natural gas supply, so it was vented. And the Texas dome natural gas was extremely easy to mine, so production skyrocketed after being freed from the shackles of government regulations.<p>Now that we&#x27;ve moved through the domed natural gas, we&#x27;re going after the harder to reach natural gas via fracking.",1379633248

Ok, here&#x27;s some details on the accident based on news stories linked there.<p>First, background for people who don&#x27;t know the area:<p>So this is in Woodside, the hills just west of Palo Alto. It&#x27;s a nice area where you get more space and nature than living in Menlo Park/PA/MV, at the cost of having a fairly slow drive to get anywhere.<p>Skyline, the road she was on, is the main north-south way through that area. It&#x27;s a one-lane-each-way, narrow-shoulder, trees-on-all-sides (leading to weird lighting at most hours) road that is fairly straight for that area, but still has some curves. I think the speed limit is 40mph.<p>The stretch of Skyline she was on is a <i>very</i> popular bike route. Some people will bike a lot of Skyline, but that ~one mile stretch is especially popular. Old La Honda Rd is a narrow, windy road that is one of the most famous cycling climbs in the area; it&#x27;s got good shade and is a very steady 7% grade for the whole 3.5 miles. It&#x27;s intense. Go out on a weekend and you will run into other cyclists, usually many others.<p>When you get to the top and want to loop back towards Palo Alto/etc, you basically have two options. One is to just go back down, but descending a road that steep and windy, especially given that there&#x27;s basically always a cliff on one side, is pretty frightening. So I always take the other option, which is to take Skyline down to highway 84, the same direction and stretch of road she was doing.<p>That always feels like the safe part of the descent to me--it&#x27;s mostly straight, people drive slightly slower than on 84, and it&#x27;s not as steep of a descent as 84. 84 is frightening because there still isn&#x27;t a shoulder, there&#x27;s some really steep sections, there&#x27;s some tight switchbacks, and people drive 50 mph.<p>But, sure enough, where her accident was on Skyline, there&#x27;s a big blind curve, and not very far after it there&#x27;s a tiny road (basically a driveway) off to the right. It sounds like as she came around that curve, a van that was headed the opposite direction on Skyline turned left in front of her into that small road, and she ended up hitting the van.<p>Scary.",1379632472

It is the opinion of those individuals that matters, and they certainly see things this way.<p>It is not just not providing a marriage, right. No job, no money, no way to be independent, no meaning in life generally ... combined with a contant barrage of commercials detailing what is important in life, and unreachable to them (think cars, what you might call &quot;nightclub women&quot;, and the like). The marriage thing factors pretty highly.",1432605549
9602583,comment,9600015,9602344,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Good question. A few reasons, in reverse priority order. First, the licensing fee is likely to be under $5000, which would be bearable (though painful) in budgetary terms. Related to that, I might consider joining the existing class action lawsuit and am not above milking that to get some extra publicity out of it.<p>Second, it was the original inspiration for the story. Now I was already well aware of the license issue so as soon as that key story element fell into place I knew it would have some sort of price tag attached, but sometimes you just have to trust your instincts.<p>Third and most important, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so universally well known that it works. I have one other piece of music I anticipate licensing in there, but if I had to for $$ reasons I&#x27;d explore alternatives.During early drafts I noted several good musical cues that would enhance or complement the story action, but while they&#x27;d still be my ideal creative selections that would probably unaffordable on my budget, and so I&#x27;m happy to work around those.<p>But &#x27;Happy Birthday&#x27; is not just an expression of my taste, it&#x27;s so universally known in the English-speaking world and beyond as to be a major cultural signifier. If I were to use some alternative birthday song like &#x27;Woot woot, it&#x27;s ya birthday&#x27; or something, it would be a huge distraction from the emotional content of the scenes, and turn them into something lame, at best, or comic, at worst. I listened a few of the alternative birthday songs linked elsewhere on the page, but (unsurprisingly) I forgot all of them within 60 seconds. You only get a few key moments in a film where characters are <i>really</i> strongly defined as individuals - you know, the lines that you can quote from a famous movie that <i>everyone</i> recognizes, eg &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna make him an offer he can&#x27;t refuse&#x27; or &#x27;You talking to me?&#x27; or &#x27;There&#x27;s no place like home.&#x27; You have to keep things simple because audience connection with a character is a matter of feeling rather than thought, and if you&#x27;re trying to process something else to evoke the same idea, then you&#x27;re not emotionally engaged with it in the moment.<p>To some extent, I&#x27;m leveraging the strong emotional connotations that the song already has for in order to intensify the dramatic impact of the scenes where it is used. In the same vein, those scenes also involve a birthday <i>cake</i> as opposed to a birthday apple pie or indeed a birthday steak - cake is a cliche but cliches are useful for drawing attention to the <i>ab</i>normal things about the situation for dramatic effect. I want to make sure that people remember those scenes where it&#x27;s used.<p>Mind, my issue with Warner/Chappell here is that I really don&#x27;t think <i>Happy Birthday</i> is actually eligible for copyright protection. If I was going for some other emotional situation that just <i>had to have</i> a particular piece of music whose copyright status wasn&#x27;t in doubt then that wouldn&#x27;t bother me, although there are very few pieces of music that are so iconic that they can&#x27;t easily be substituted for - the only one I can think of is the Bridal Chorus from Wagner&#x27;s Lohengrin, better known as &#x27;Here comes the bride...&#x27; for use at weddings, or maybe Taps for military funerals, but even that is a specifically American thing.",1432605549

Hacks happen by the millions with headaches being the main result along with lost time and money. Even most security-critical systems are the same with the main targeting being done for espionage (data theft). High assurance security focuses on what can get people killed (esp military use) with an emphasis on tools such as these. I&#x27;ve never seen a mainstream FOSS or proprietary product show evidence of an EAL6+ development process, though.

9602577,comment,9598512,9601414,0,0,schoen,,,"There&#x27;s a tension between referring to it as decentralized and saying that it has a server.<p>This approach is great in general, but there are some known challenges about padding and latency.<p>One is that you have to use padding up to the maximum rate at which you want to send data, so if you want to have some service that can use 500 kB/s, you have to send and receive that much data all the time.<p>Another is that you may have to make server transmissions nearly synchronous; you can&#x27;t send extra data in a window even if you have a backlog.  If you break this rule, then an attacker who can delay one user&#x27;s traffic can use that power to confirm a hypothesis that two users are talking to one another.  This probably means that you can use it for e-mail and IM, but probably not voice.  There may also be a problem if a user is momentarily or permanently disproportionately popular and hence wants to receive more data than the standard padding rate allows.<p>You may also have to overcome users&#x27; inclination to only use the service when they&#x27;re talking to each other.  If not, the time windows when particular pairs of people were active may eventually show a strong correlation, especially the times when both of them disconnected.",1432605373

9602569,comment,9601777,9602472,0,0,yareally,,,"Have you used any imperative, statically typed language that&#x27;s compiled, such as C#, C++ or Swift? Previous knowledge of a purely functional language would be useful as well, but not required. Knowing Java helps with debugging and working with libraries built from Java, which depending on what one is doing (Android for example or using JSoup for scraping), is inescapable. You&#x27;ll end up having to semi learn Java along the way, at least from what a friend told me (I already knew Java previously, so cannot comment on that). Scala, like C#, has extension methods to make dealing with Java libraries easier though, but it still doesn&#x27;t solve things like JDK annoyances (type erasure).<p>If you&#x27;re only familiar with scripting languages, it&#x27;s going to be sort of a leap into learning Scala and could be done I think, though probably not the language I would recommend starting with since it&#x27;s easy to abuse. The syntax is nowhere the same, but Scala sort of reminds me of the &quot;Perl of statically compiled languages&quot; in that you can write some really obtuse code without even trying if you&#x27;re not careful. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad thing necessarily, because it&#x27;s a language that gives you a lot of flexibility (and more than enough rope to hang yourself). If you work with someone else, be sure to discuss some sort of agreed upon standard to using Scala, else you&#x27;ll end up with some messy code.<p>Scala looks a bit like Python in parts as well as Swift, but I consider it more closer to a progressive version of C# with F# mixed into it.",1432605256

If you can see the file system with your working one that&#x27;s one thing (see what to copy farther below), if it&#x27;s unreadable right off then you need to have some emergency thing.<p>For repair disk you could create a bootable linux rescue disk image on a USB flash drive and if its big enough you can store your salvaged programs (one Ive used is System Rescue CD, has tools built in.  - note rescue is technical if you aren’t familiar with the commands through the terminal and Mac file system best to have someone who knows what they are doing do this...) Once you got the bootable image you restart your computer with the option key to get the boot selector to select the usb image and boot.  (if the mac was OS 10.6.4+ should boot a Linux USB image fine; prior to that Macs didn&#x27;t have the firmware update for that supports other bootloaders)<p>Now for recovering your applications, get the needed stuff in applications folder, and related preference and extension files in your user/library and system/library and also preferences for both folders - dig around a little there may be multiple places for stuff to have been installed.

Of course, Venus-bound missions would &quot;require big policy changes at NASA,&quot; writes Elizabeth Lopatto for The Verge.  But two scientists, Dale Arney and Chris Jones, of NASA’s Systems Analysis and Concepts Directorate at Langley Research Center in Virginia, point out that about 31 miles above the surface, the gravity and pressure is Earth-like, temperatures stay near the more manageable 167 degrees F and the colony would be more shielded from the Sun’s radiation than Mars.<p>It is easier to heat something than cool something. A permanently flying vessel [which is essentially what Venus requires] isn&#x27;t safe except as a robotic design. It is a fatal mechanical failure waiting to happen.<p>There is a reason planes need so much maintenance and it isn&#x27;t &quot;saving money&quot;. A plane that would never have to land or need maintenance would be cheaper.<p>Sure, the ISS can manage it and you could probably set up something similar on Venus. But it wouldn&#x27;t be a permanent, expandable settlement like you might be able to do on Mars.",1432603561

I have noticed that one thing Delco does is to commission custom silicon with a view to saving money as millions of units are manufactured.  Since additional complexity has the potential to reduce yield, why not shave bits off an ADC if the precision isn&#x27;t needed?  On a low spec engine, like the TBI 350cid, probably almost all of the inputs can be approximations, so the level of precision and accuracy you&#x27;d expect from buying an industrial sensor and off the shelf, discrete ADC is not necessary.  And it follows that the sensors themselves should be as cheap as possible as far as it lets the engine meet the mandated goals, including a certain degree of reliability.  Of course, I hope that a modern design of DOHC engine facing modern emissions regulations will be fitted with more advanced sensors and controls.<p>The serial data link for the electronic carburetor control abomination and EFI controls is an example of the thoughtfulness that I meant.  They implemented it really early, even quite earlier than the German makes I know about.

That&#x27;s not how it should work and certainly not how Apple got so successful. I think you might mean &quot;aesthetics&quot;, that would be an important difference.<p>Good design is never just decoration, it&#x27;s not just an aesthetic hull with the &quot;real&quot; functionality hidden behind it. Good design is from the ground up, how the entire experience is structured, including the stuff under the hood. Apple&#x27;s main strength is in putting a <i>ton</i> of research into how users actually use their devices (textbook &quot;usability&quot;) and making sure things are always ranked by importance. There&#x27;s stuff iOS doesn&#x27;t do that most Android devices do and it&#x27;s not missing because Apple can&#x27;t pull it off, it&#x27;s because they decided not to waste space/learning-time for the user on something that might, for most people, not be important. Meanwhile, niche functionality is supported through a myriad of apps. That&#x27;s not minimalism for the sake of aesthetics, that&#x27;s a really smart usability decision that has payed off over and over for them. For a counter-example, I&#x27;m sure Apple was <i>very</i> tempted to make the Apple Watch touch-only but instead included a somewhat clumsy looking scroll wheel because that makes more sense for such a tiny display.<p>The few places where aesthetics clash with functionality (a lack of physical buttons that might seem reasonable, some questionable font choices,...) tend to get replaced by a more all-around solution (forget about buttons and go straight to touch) or a willingness to identify and fix problems (a new font for Apple Watch and iOS9).<p>I really don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll get very far by calling out usability, of all things, as an area where Apple lacks. Apple has other problems, they&#x27;re not perfect. But if they fail, it&#x27;ll probably not be because of usability issues.

9602427,comment,9595507,9596754,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Nice thinking but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a great idea. The reason, which I warned tommy, was that there&#x27;s plenty of code in there for significant situations that are uncommon or even rare. You&#x27;d have to pick out about every way you&#x27;d configure, run, maintain, and so on a binary program to exercise all its relevant functionality. You&#x27;d also have to hit it with various errors to be sure they&#x27;re within the same libraries. Otherwise, you&#x27;re risking leaving out something critical and it will be hard to figure out by the time trimming is done.<p>For this reason, I thought about using Windows Embedded as it has configuration tools to strip out most unnecessary things while being compatible with whatever you want. That plus stripping guides. Alternatively, stick with tommy&#x27;s stripping-style method. Either way, you eventually have a set of files you turn into an image with proprietary or open tools along with configuration scripts to make it unique. That has many advantages in addition to size in terms of administration, backup, and even security.",1432602490

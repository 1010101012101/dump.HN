628279,comment,628231,628269,0,0,ars,,,"The article suggests up to 15%. Assume 10%, and a $1000 yearly A/C bill, that's a savings of $100 a year.<p>Energy spent is pretty much exactly equal to the price of the paint. So how much does paint cost? How much to install, and how long does it last?<p>All theoretical questions, since I don't think paint that can survive on a roof exists.<p>I'm going to make some wild guesses:<p>You need 10 gallons of paint at a cost of $40 per gallon. And it takes about 1 day to install, at a cost of 8 hour*40 $/hour.<p>So total it would be about $720 to install. And I bet it would last 3 to 5 years. Lets be generous and say 5.<p>So it costs $144 per year, but saves you $100.<p>Not a good plan. It uses more energy than it saves.<p>Of course my numbers are totally guesses. Especially the cost for paint that does not exist.",1243420202

Acme's ability to run commands by clicking on text is more productive than you're giving it credit for right now. Want another menu item? Just type it into the menu bar!

628271,comment,628231,628261,0,0,ars,,,"It strongly depends on where you live.<p>But very little of the heat from the roof gets in the building in the winter. Mainly because it's insulated. But also because hot air rises, so little of it travels down to the building space.<p>But A/C is with vents, AKA air currents, so may be more effective at capturing heat from ceilings.<p>But all that ignores the fact that white paint does not survive. In Tuscon the roofs would have white rocks on the roof. I strongly doubt you could make a white roof paint that would survive for more than a few years.<p>How about shiny aluminium roofs?<p>As a side note, I always wondered why metal roofs are not more popular. Aluminium would last pretty much forever, and it doesn't have to be one piece - you can make it into shingles for easy installation.",1243419392

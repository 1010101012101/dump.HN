4241273,comment,4240704,4241196,3,0,rthomas6,,,"Yes, I agree, Wall St. is predatory and misleading. To think an investment does not have some associated risk is ignorant. But there are different levels of risk. I'm still going to argue that there are fairly secure ways to be involved in ""Wall Street"" investments, as long as one is diversified, attentive, and cautious. Giving your entire retirement savings over to Wall Street is definitely too much of a gamble for most people, but giving over some fraction of it is usually a good idea. We participate in this economy every day. Why not invest in it, as long as we are prudent and cautious? It grows over the long term, and has done so for the last several decades, or even centuries.<p>Now, that does not mean that the economy will continue to grow, and that is where the risk is involved. But I choose to believe that, over the long term, on average, the world economy will continue to increase in value. I also believe that personally owning very small portions of it will increase my own net worth.",1342205686

A demographicly uniform team can communicate more effectively with each other (due to having a larger shared vocabulary of common experiences) and this reduced communication overhead greatly increases their productivity.<p>>If there were something keeping women out of the community, you'd want to fix it. Right?<p>This metrics vs. data thing is precisely why hearing people go on about the lack of women in programming makes me nervous. It reminds me of my manager going on about how our unit test coverage is only 60% and why isn't it 70%; if you define low test coverage as the problem rather than the symptom, we could easily write some terrible tests that would increase the coverage but make our codebase worse.<p>So likewise, if you start thinking about ""only 4% of open source developers are women"" as a problem /in itself/, it's very easy to jump from there to doing something that increases the number of women in open source, while actually making things worse (e.g. ""let's offer a load of bursaries for female CS undergrads to work on open source projects""; quick, easy, increases that percentage, but could quite possibly backfire by giving women in open source a reputation for low-quality code - and more to the point, does absolutely nothing to address whatever actual problem you're referring to)",1342205597

The Internet comes along and you have things like Usenet and the proto-Web.<p>Then comes the first crowdsourcing sites to allow people to find content without employing people to curate that information. Slashdot was certainly early in this trend.<p>What Digg allowed is a certain band of people to control the information flow. People would get paid to promote submissions as it became clear that a front-page submission generated a lot of pageviews.<p>But what became apparent with all these community sites (and this includes forums) is they start with an early group who provide value to each other. This group ends up becoming insular. De facto standards form. But even in the Usenet days you had the ""September"" problem (where new college freshmen would get Internet access and not understand the ""rules"" and conventions that were in place and would ask questions that had already been answered, etc).<p>Basically all these social sites get worse over time as the masses flood in.<p>Digg died because the idea that there is a central source for news was a holdover idea from the old media days. Reddit understood this. Global reddit is basically useless. The subreddits are the only remotely interesting thing about reddit.<p>People complain about how HN is getting worse. That's probably true and it is true (and will continue to be true) of any such social site in the future.<p>I've heard the same complaints about Twitter.<p>Facebook for most people is not a source of news. It doesn't have the same link-sharing mindshare (IMHO) for most people that other mediums have. Ultimately I think the biggest use case for Facebook is still sharing photos. People go to Facebook to find out what their friends are doing. Very few go to find out what's going on in the world (much as Facebook would like that to be the case).<p>I'm surprised at how some wax lyrical on how amazing reddit is. It's just a minor tweak on a long trend of existing prior art (the subreddits). Personally I think it's a cesspool full of trolls. Proggit (programming.reddit.com) is (IMHO) just awful.",1342204781

Even the bank's returns are non-deterministic. The government could collapse. Even keeping money in your house under the mattress includes risk (what if your house catches fire?). What method of saving or investing wealth would you say is deterministic?<p>A better measure of whether or not something is gambling is how much risk is associated with it. If I bought a US government bond, nobody would call that a gamble, because it's very unlikely that the the government will collapse. Similarly, if I bought a mutual fund comprised of a mixture of large, stable companies and various bonds, it is unlikely that it will go down in value over the long term. ""Over the long term"" is the key here. If the US economy has an overall downward trend for the next 40 years, then think about what that would mean.

Your question is specious.<p><i>It shows population correlations.</i> In a general population, where a range of bodytypes may be assumed, there will be <i>a</i> correlation between BMI and body fat percentage. There's relatively little argument over that, though as I mentioned above, the actual utility of BMI for epidemiological / population studies is being question.<p>- The question isn't ""is there a correlation?"", but ""is the correlation between BMI and body fat stronger or weaker than for other estimators of body fat?"".  For which you'd want to look at the r^2, RSS (residual sum of squares), and perhaps plotted residuals to determine the appropriateness of the model, <i>in comparison with</i> other estimators:  waist circumference, height/waist ratio (most people also have a pretty good idea of their waist size), circumference and caliper estimators, etc.<p>- To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, in epidemiological population studies, you conduct research with the data you have, not with the data you want.  Height and weight are widely collected and reported, even from sources such as DMV files (though they may also be wildly inaccurate).  For large-scale or national studies, this makes for large datasets. The <i>relevance</i> and <i>usefulness</i> of the data may not be as high as, say, DEXA analysis, or even waist to height ratio (<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20050606/waist-height-ratio-may-show-heart-disease-risk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20050606/waist-heigh...</a>), but it's <i>there</i>.  And for at least some purposes, useful.<p>Extending the use to individuals, where in most settings (home, gym, doctor's office, clinic, health fair), availability of necessary measurement tools (tape measure, calipers, even the wildly inaccurate handheld electronic bioimpedance monitors) is readily facilitated, there's really no call to rely on BMI.<p>- The problem with BMI is that it's essentially saying ""<i>if</i> you fit our model of body fat relative to height and weight, <i>then</i> here is where you fall on our model of obesity"".  Again, for a general population this relationship holds reasonably well, but for an individual, where the question specifically is ""what is my body fat percentage"", BMI is the wrong tool for the job.  It fails notably for specific populations of interest -- it will consistently <i>underreport</i> obesity in less-healthy populations, and <i>overreports</i> obesity in more-healthy populations. It can also result in nonsensical intervention recommendations:  most unfit people will <i>benefit</i> by efforts to increase lean muscle mass, despite the fact that for those with lower BMIs this will <i>decrease</i> their putative health score by increasing overall body mass.  I suspect this is among the reasons strength training is under-recommended for increasing fitness (most literature addresses ""diet"" and ""exercise"" generally, but makes little or no distinction between cardio and strength training, or focuses virtually exclusively on cardio).",1342203839

It's still possible to be at a healthy body fat percentage and have a BMI of 27 or higher, but obviously it's not as likely as it is at the cutoff of 25.<p>Overall, I think BMI is probably a pretty good overall metric, just not a good diagnosis for an individual.  For instance, a physician might notice that a patient has a BMI above 25, but then see that waist to height ratio or a bf measurement looks very favorable.<p>From a broad numbers perspective, I think BMI is probably very useful - for instance, if you notice that a higher percentage of a population has a BMI in excess of 27 than in previous years, you can safely estimate that the population is becoming increasingly overweight.  I suspect that the situation where people have high bmi's with low body fat is limited to a small number of athletes who are not typical of the population at large.",1342203553

4241035,comment,4239150,4240096,2,0,rcthompson,,,"George Orwell was talking about removing <i>important</i> words from the language. For example, removing any words relating to democracy and freedom from the language would prevent people from expressing what they thought they might want the government to give them. This isn't just reducing someone's vocabulary. This is targeted destruction of a language's capacity to express specific concepts. When you learn a language, you learn the important words first.<p>We can make an analogy to programming languages. The reduced vocabulary (if any) from learning two languages at once can be likened to the fact that when you learn two programming languages you will probably not be familiar with as many modules from each language that you learn, whereas focusing on one programming language would allow you to deeply learn all the modules available. However, you would still fully learn the syntax and most of the core features of both programming languages. In contrast, the analogy to what George Orwell was talking about would be removing features from the core language to the point that it is no longer Turing-complete, and is only capable of expressing ""approved"" programs. Kind of like HQ9+[1], only instead of ""hello world"", quine, and 99 bottles, it's ""The government is great"", ""I love the government"", and ""All power to the government"". The plus can still increment the accumulator, but the accumulator represents how much you love the government.<p>[1] <a href=""http://esolangs.org/wiki/HQ9%2B"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esolangs.org/wiki/HQ9%2B</a>",1342203154

What makes these communities special is that a lot of them have very specialized and very diverse knowledge, not necessarily related to the subjects Reddit's early adopters were interested in. There are subreddits for science, fitness, finance, sex, art and just about any other subject people would be interested in following.

They say things like The display is glued to the case. which is wrong.<p>The display assembly (the actual screen where the lights shine true) is glued together. Im not sure but I think that part of the display is always pretty tightly integrated, probably even glued together. (I tried to find information on that and I would be very glad if someone could point me to resources about how laptop displays are usually built.)<p>The difference with Apples design (as far as I understand it) is that the frontmost layer of that assembly is also the front glass of the screen. Other laptops with glass in front of the screen put an extra layer of glass in front of the display assembly. The Retina MacBook Pro doesnt have that extra glass. (My understanding  but please correct me if Im wrong, Im really not sure and I would like to know more  is that old displays had a sort of plastic outer layer, now Apple uses a glass outer layer. But thats not that a big deal, as far as I know, since on the inside all LCDs use glass substrate also  so its not as if Apple introduced glass into the display assembly, some was always there, they just added more. But maybe Im wrong about that.)<p>That display assembly is screwed  not glued  to the case.

If you dont care about breaking the laptop (since you want to recycle it) that should be no big deal. I mean, Apple replaces the battery for $200, no questions asked. I dont think they replace the whole Retina MacBook Pro every time they do that, so they must remove the glued-in battery, and that inside a working laptop.

This quote from Radiohead kind of comforts me, because I know it's a common problem that a lot of guys see.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_(Radiohead_song)#Composition_and_lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_(Radiohead_song)#Composit...</a><p>> According to Yorke, ""Creep"" tells the tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the attention of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about ""Creep"" in 1993, Yorke said, ""I have a real problem being a man in the '90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... ""<p>And this really isn't limited to Defcon.  I've gone to raves and there are guys going around the crowd asking ""wanna have sex?"" to every chick they see.  They'll learn soon enough that... that doesn't work, and it's probably inappropriate.  Even for a rave.<p>I don't think anyone really wants to leave their comfort zone.  They want to feel safe, and approaching someone else makes them feel unsafe.  Both sexes are going to do that, so, maybe it's up to us (men) to be the bigger party and bridge the gap.  Take the discomfort, so that the women don't have to.  It sucks, it's annoying, and by their unaction and our willingness for auction we are reenforcing gender stereotypes, but at least we can meet people that way.",1342202681

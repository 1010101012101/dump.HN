One second prior to the action, the course you would take is set. This is actually probably a point in favor of the possibility of freewill; humans are course-taking machines, we have a whole life (and our evolution before that) to acquire dispositions that will one day help us survive. What kind of freewill do we want? Do we want to be &quot;free to dodge a brick when thrown at us&quot; or &quot;free, one second before the brick arrives, to duck or not duck&quot;. Which of these is the important one? The kind of freewill we really want isn&#x27;t the kind where we are free floating actors, it is the kind where our history, personal and evolutionary, dictates our present. The point is, real freedom is not about being without limits, it is about having sensible responses to ones environment; creatures evolve the freedom to avoid being eaten, the freedom to anticipate others&#x27; actions, the freedom to manipulate other agents with our clever words. Dan Dennett makes a better case for this than I, please look into his wonderful books on the topic.<p>Daniel Dennett: \n--Elbow Room \n--Freedom Evolves",1389855595

He says maladjustment (which is just one component of aging) is.<p>>>> Aging comes from misunderstanding ? This is just random babbling,<p>You are trying very hard to not understand. The thought is simple - comfort has side effects (think obesity, bad nutrition, lack of movement, overuse of pharmaceuticals like antibiotics or mood adjusters, etc.) which are not properly appreciated (they are starting to be, but we are still far from proper realization (understanding) of what and how much we pay for it and doing something about it). Not understanding those effects influences behaviors in such ways that people harm themselves. These effects accumulate and contribute to what is called &quot;aging&quot; - you can eat random junk when you are 20 and be fine, but keep doing it till you&#x27;re 50 and you&#x27;ll be the best client of your local healthcare facilities for the rest of your life. And so on and so forth. I won&#x27;t say it is the deepest of observations - actually, it&#x27;s pretty rapidly becoming a commonplace and sometimes even a fashion - but it definitely not a &quot;random babbling&quot;.<p>I get an impression that you just came to a hard conclusion that Taleb literally writes nonsense and you are hard set on not allowing any sense that is contained in his writing - and can be easily seen - to get to you. Your right of course, but I personally fail to find any utility in such a behavior.",1389855442

And I work with &quot;data scientists&quot;, most with Ph.D.s, many in statistics.<p>I always talk about his book, but I cannot for the life of me find a single person who&#x27;s even read it.  I think: these are some the ONLY book about stats on the NY Times best seller lists (up until Nate Silver).  And yet all these professionals have not only not read it, but barely even heard of it?<p>My hypothesis was that it is more popular on the East Coast than the West Coast (of the US).  Are you from either of those places?  I am originally from the east coast but work on the west coast.  To hand wave a bit, I feel like west coast people are less into &quot;ideas&quot; and more into actions and experiences.  Taleb&#x27;s ideas do have somewhat of a nytimes-ish new yorker-ish east coast culture flavor.  And a lot of people working in Silicon Valley are not really that interested in philosophy.<p>On the subject of his writing, I can totally see that people can be turned off by his writing.  He can be arrogant and insulting.  I find it kind of funny, but that&#x27;s a matter of taste.<p>A few things I remember from his books that I really liked:<p>- The story of Nobel prize winner Myron Scholes, and namesake of the Black-Scholes equation, which I learned about in computational finance in college.  He started a company &quot;Long Term Capital Management&quot;, to monetize this ideas, and promptly lost billions of dollars.  <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Schole"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Scholes</a><p>That&#x27;s not interesting?  I think the difference between theory and practice is intensely interesting, and Taleb has a lot to say about it.<p>- I largely agree with his philosophy that people who claim to know things cause more harm than good.  The downfall of Alan Greenspan and Bernanke is their arrogance.  They think they can control the economy.  But they can&#x27;t and caused millions of people real harm.<p>- Respect for the old.  For all its virtues, Silicon Valley does have a severe case of &quot;neomania&quot;.  Taleb&#x27;s ideas about things that last apply to software too.  Unix and C are going to be around a lot longer than say Hadoop or Puppet/Chef.<p>- The philosophy of fragility also applies to software in a straightforward way.  Most people know this now, but you should continually expose your software to users and the market, not build up grand ideas in your head.<p>- actions over knowledge, i.e. people who know how to do things but not explain them<p>I could list a half a dozen more important ideas but I&#x27;ll stop there.<p>I did write in my comments about this book that he overreached on his &quot;trilogy&quot; idea for the Antifragile.  But I do like how he draws together a lot of seemingly disparate ideas that are philosophically related.",1389853291

Say there are a few thousand different candlemakers who currently ply their trade individually. Some subset of them decide to join together and incorporate in a company that will negotiate prices and contracts as a group, instead of individually. So they form Candlemakers, Inc., a Delaware corporation and your provider of enterprise candle solutions. This is not illegal, even though formerly competing candlemakers have joined forces and now collude in their provision of candles. They can even negotiate exclusive deals: maybe you get a discount on candles or otherwise more favorable terms if your restaurant/bar/church agrees to make Candlemakers Inc. your <i>exclusive</i> supplier of candles, i.e. for a period of N years you agree not to buy candles made by candlemakers who <i>didn&#x27;t</i> join Candlemakers Inc. This is still not illegal or considered collusion.<p>Now if instead of it being contractors who joined together by incorporating, the candlemakers were employees who joined together by unionizing, why is this much different? And why do exclusivity deals legal in the incorporated case become illegal in the union case (the &quot;closed shop&quot;, i.e. an agreement to only hire the union&#x27;s members as candlemakers for some period of time)? They seem pretty analogous to me. The Candlemaker&#x27;s Local 382 and Candlemaker&#x27;s Inc. are doing pretty similar things: taking formerly individual candlemakers and joining them into a larger entity that markets its members&#x27; services jointly. They differ only in the precise arrangement by which the joined workers provide services to the purchaser: one is a union of employees who&#x27;ve joined together to sell their pooled candlemaking labor to the company, and the other a union of contractors who&#x27;ve joined together to sell their pooled candlemaking services to the company.<p>The place where the analogy to cartels works better for me is in large umbrella union organizations, like the AFL-CIO, if they coordinate their exercise of market power. But some of that is already illegal, e.g. secondary boycotts are illegal under U.S. law.",1389852245

There are plenty of discussions on HN about how hard it is to learn to code and that there is &quot;something missing&quot; from current methods for teaching it. Since he can ask questions, assuming you are someone he feels comfortable &quot;bugging&quot;, the odds are good he can decide for himself how much to ask and when in order to foster actual understanding.<p>I learned to code when someone hand-coded a small site for me and then gifted me the code. My then husband was double majoring in history and computer science. He had to explain FTP program to me and some other very basic things. Then I began playing with the code by just substituting color codes for the ones already there and seeing what it did. This is not very different from my school experience with French where they would give you a sentence (&quot;The house is red&quot;) and have you substitute the one descriptor (&quot;The house is blue&quot;, &quot;The house is yellow&quot;).<p>Perhaps he will be bored. Or perhaps this will be a unique learning opportunity for him. Helen Keller learned to sign in spite of being both deaf and blind and a small child. Her parents already had some homemade &quot;signs&quot; for her to use to engage in crude communication and the teacher was just persistent in signing things into her hand over and over and over until, one day, she realized the signs had meaning. It just suddenly clicked. Then she ran around asking, in essence, &quot;What&#x27;s this?!&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s this?!&quot; about everything she could get her hands on.<p>We don&#x27;t fully understand how that happens, but it does.<p>FWIW: I homeschooled my two gifted-learning disabled sons for many years. My oldest thinks in pictures and needs broad context before the details make sense. Other people need all the details to build the broad context. Different strokes for different folks.",1392494209
7245068,comment,7242788,7243995,3,0,catwell,,,"As always you can always find anecdotes going both ways.<p>I am French and a public hospital actually forgot my father in a room for a week. He needed surgery, not urgently but in the meantime he had to be kept sedated. They kept him on morphine, fed him but he was not tracked as scheduled for surgery by their information system. And of course nurses kept telling us it was normal.<p>There is also a lot of abuse from this system, especially since the pharmaceutical lobby is quite powerful. They actually cover 30% of the cost of <i>homeopathy</i>! And when there was a H1N1 epidemy a few years back the French government ordered wice as many doses as the population of the country.<p>Comparing the cost of healthcare does not take other parameters into account. For instance obesity is not as much of an issue in France than it is in the US, and that helps decrease the overall cost of healthcare.<p>And of course, part of the reason is also that it is easy to keep prices down by having the State decide them instead of a free market. But the result is that some health professions are clearly underpaid. There were huge demonstrations of midwifes recently because of that, for instance.<p>But all in all I cannot deny that I still prefer our system to what exists in the US. As comments in this thread shows, it is not our system which is perfect, it is yours that looks terrible.",1392494207

That is to say, we do not know things as they are in themselves--we only know them insofar as they have properties that can be reflected in a form that can be processed by our intuition. We bring space and time with us, as part of our structure, and mathematics is an examination of that structure.<p>So Kant would have it that mathematics is neither a Platonic form nor something we have created-it&#x27;s an exploration of our capabilities of sensation. This seems to me like a much better explanation of why mathematics are &quot;universal&quot; than the article&#x27;s approach.<p>It also leaves open the question of whether we are &quot;living in a computer simulation&quot; without suggesting that it&#x27;s a simple matter (or even necessarily possible) to see out from inside.",1392494138

It&#x27;s pretty common to limit fraud by going off people&#x27;s IP address until you&#x27;ve got an established relationship with them. Using a credit card from another country is a huge fraud flag.<p>My Office365 account is listed as being in &quot;Colombia&quot; (CO) and insists on a Colombian address if I want to update my billing info -- despite my current billing address being Colorado (CO) and me never having been to Colombia. Tech support says there no way to change this, that my account will permanently be set as Colombia, despite it being obvious that the current billing address is Colorado (and Wells Fargo doesn&#x27;t even have banks in Colombia, AFAIK).<p>Seems like companies just really suck when it comes to multi-country handling. Xbox lets me buy games, <i>proceeds to download them completely</i>, then does a geo-IP check and says &quot;Corrupted&quot;. Xbox support insisted my hardware was bad (despite many other games downloading just fine), until I mentioned I wasn&#x27;t in the US. Only at that point did they figure out there was a geo-IP check going on <i>after</i> the download that leads to the &quot;Corrupted&quot; error. They were actually going to completely replace my Xbox unit, determining the motherboard or something was selectively corrupting data for specific games. The remedy: &quot;Oh move back to the US&quot;. No refunds or anything. (Real remedy: PPTP.)<p>Google takes it a step further, and disables updates for apps if they aren&#x27;t available in whatever it determines to be your current region. I installed the Wells Fargo app, then went travelling. During that time, WF app releases a critical security update and ceases functioning until updated. Android points out &quot;update available&quot;.

If you have a spare 50 minutes, it&#x27;s really really worth your time to listen.<p>In sum, the argument goes like this: if there is more than one universe, then there will be some universes that are larger than ours, some that are smaller, some that are younger and some that are much, much older. If we, in our universe, have evolved intelligence sufficient to construct machines to simulate simple mammalian brains, then it is reasonable to assume that beings in a much larger, much older universe would have computational power far in excess of ours. So much so, that not only would they be able to simulate entire smaller, younger universes, but those simulations may themselves have the ability to simulate even smaller, younger universes. Turtles all the way down, so to speak.<p>So even if the very biggest, oldest universes form the long tail of all possible universes, the fact that they could simulate universes that simulate universes that simulate universes means that, all else being equal, the probability that our universe is real is much less than the probability that we are, in fact, in a simulation.",1392492350

You<p>(1) simulate a universe with finite volume (state-of-the-art calculations have boxes just a few times bigger than a nucleus in each direction),<p>(2) discretize the space into a bunch of points some lattice spacing apart connected by links, and,<p>(3) possibly simulate at values of the quark masses that are not their physical values (this helps make a a matrix you need to invert better-conditioned).<p>Finally, you know what action[1] you want to simulate (that of QCD[2]) and you construct a discretized action that accounts for all of the above approximations that approaches the real action you want to simulate when you take the limits volume --> infinity, lattice spacing --> 0, masses --> physical values.<p>There are many different ways to build such a discretized action (and they go by names like the Wilson action, the Domain Wall action, the Staggered action, and others), but no discretized action is &quot;perfect&quot; in the sense that anything you try to measure can have errors that depend on how different the volume you actually measured is from the infinite-volume limit, how much having a finite lattice spacing changes your answer, and how much unphysical masses matter.<p>We have theory that controls how measured quantities depend on these parameters, and thus can understand, via extrapolation, how lattice artifacts change the quantities we measure from the true continuum limit.<p>You can use this understanding to find out what the answer is in the limit of there being no discretization at all (lattice spacing = 0) and then compare measurements of our world to those predictions.  If they match, then the world doesn&#x27;t really have a grid of points at its bottom, but if they don&#x27;t match you can find out how finely spaced the grid of spacetime is.<p>Unfortunately, any simulation you do will have error bars, and so in practice all you can say is &quot;the continuum world looks like this ± that&quot;, the practical consequence being that you can only put an upper bound on how different the lattice spacing of spacetime is from zero:  &quot;If the lattice spacing were bigger than X then we would have conflict between the experimental observations we made of the universe and the simulation.  No such conflict is known, so the lattice spacing is smaller than X.&quot;<p>Source: I am a postdoc doing lattice QCD, and I have met Martin and Zohreh.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_QCD"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_QCD</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics</a>",1392491300

If you&#x27;re anyone else, though, the best advice regarding SillyCon Valley is just to sit this lifetime out, because the factors that matter most are those you can&#x27;t do anything about.",1392490884

Writing well is one example. That said, it does still correlate to success, and therefore still functions as evidence. There are too many comments on the internet to act as though every one is equally worth reading. It makes more sense to do a quick Bayesian update on the available evidence and move on to a comment that is more likely to be valuable. This isn&#x27;t a value judgment about the person who made the comment, it&#x27;s just pragmatism.",1392490881

I was just going to say the same thing...<p>My interest in Google+ is the same interest I had in facebook years ago: some site I upload and share my personal photos with people I choose.<p>Now, I see that:\n1. my photos upload automatically from my android to Google+, so I never have to worry about accidentally losing them. (and yes, you can set FB up to do that too)<p>2. my photos look better on Google+ because it doesn&#x27;t squeeze the quality out of them like FB does. (and yes, you can somehow get FB to improve that too, but I never even bothered to looked)<p>3. I can edit my photos right in the browser.<p>4. It shows me many different auto-awesome features, and allows me to stitch photos and clips into movies in seconds...<p>5. I don&#x27;t have to worry about friends I add tomorrow, or next year, seeing photos I shared yesterday!!! If you&#x27;ve had multiple x-girlfriends, as I imagine most folks on HN have... that could be a constant problem.<p>Those features didn&#x27;t all come up over night, but somewhere along the line I stopped using FB and started putting photos on Google+",1392490817

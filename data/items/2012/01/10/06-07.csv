But for people who are very busy and don't get time to do their work properly. I have tested following methods which I suggested you to do. You will be surprise how quickly you will finish your whole week work in 3-4 days. Yes that is true. Even you will also get free time to do other stuff and developmenet of career too.<p>When you change you habit and awoke early morning instead of late, you get more time to do things. And due to our circadian rhythm which state when our body is peak to do something and when it require real sleep. We adjust our biological clocks.<p>So forget to sleep late in morning, and awoke at 6 a.m. than pray and do good exercise and start your office/study work.<p>Here are some tips to help you.\nPlan Your Morning the Night Before-Having a plan laid out the day before made things much easier for me.  The first two days were a bit of a blur for the first 10 minutes.  Then I realized that I wrote exactly what I was supposed to be doing on a whiteboard.  I had the tasks numbered in order or importance so that, just in case I was less productive, the most important task would be completed.<p>Try to organize your morning so that the vital things are taken care of first.  Depending on how you operate, you may want to exercise first.  Or perhaps your prayer and meditation time should come first if that will be the most effective way to get you going.  For me, if I try to pray and meditate as soon as I get up, my thoughts tend to drift.  That is why I like to get up and be active first so that I am focused when I pray and meditate.<p>Have Something to Look Forward To-Writing in the mornings was an exciting change for me.  Before, when I would wake up later, I would have a good idea and then make a note of it so that I can go back to it.  But when I made writing a morning activity, that good idea was captured in its entirety.<p>If there is something that you enjoy doing or experiencing, move it to your morning routine.  For example, if you enjoy taking a bubble bath after work, take that bath in the morning.  It will add the same type of satisfaction that will be carried out throughout the day.<p>No Snooze, Ever-One of the rules I put into place for my experiment was the rule that I could not use the snooze button, ever!  When you hit the snooze on your alarm you are allowing your mind to wake up gradually.  This may slow down your productivity and energy.<p>As soon as you alarm goes off, take a deep breath, sit up straight and plant your feet on the floor.   Do this even if your eyes are not open yet.  I found that the best thing to do in the morning is to get moving before your mind even realizes how early it is.<p>Change Alarm Sounds-To keep from getting used to waking up the same way, I suggest changing alarm sounds.  I use my Blackberry alarm and there are several different ringtones available.  I have a backup alarm that is set to wake me up 15 minutes after my Blackberry alarm goes off.  The sound of that alarm is much louder and more annoying.  This gives me another reason to get up as soon as the first alarm goes off because I know if I don’t, the second alarm that sounds like an ambulance is driving through my bedroom will do it.<p>Hard to Reach Alarm-If you really have a problem getting out of bed in the morning I suggest placing your alarm away from your bed.   The sound will force you to get out of bed to manually turn off the alarm.  You are more likely to stay awake after getting up and taking action.<p>Routines Create a Habit-Create a habit of getting going by establishing a routine.  I found that morning routines are fairly easy to establish.  After Wednesday, I found that I was already beginning to create habits such as not hitting the snooze button and looking at my white board as soon as my eyes were open.  This routine should begin the night before and should include things that will make it easier for you to wake up such as going to bed at a certain time.<p>Know Your Body-Some people need 8 hours of sleep a night while others can do fine with 6.  During my week, I realized that I could do very well on 6 ½ hours of sleep.  Any less than that and I would need a power nap in the afternoon.  Find out how much sleep you really need to be effective.  Make sure that you are enough sleep so that you are not groggy and tired all day.<p>If you like email, you forward to others, if only person changed with this email, that is realy great.<p>Regards",1326178756

What I've found is that holding the quality of the app constant, you can experiment with the pricing. You might get 10 sales at $5 or 50 sales at $1.

There's probably another sentiment that Hollywood could do everything it does now with smaller budgets if they were subject to more natural market forces.

What if I pour so much time into this super-premium app and then it doesn't sell? Whereas I can do five .99 or 1.99 apps in the same amount of time.<p>But then I think about how crowded the app store is and how bad discoverability is, and maybe going after a super-small niche with a high price is actually the only low-risk strategy left (long tail). And maybe since it's so niche, you win just by showing up, not by building a super premium app. Which then begs the question of how you find ideas like that.<p>I'm rambling, but I'd love thoughts from those who have dabbled in the tiny-niche-but-high-cost model on the app store.",1326176490

Of course there are other perks being from two cultures and speaking two languages, especially in formation of relations and bridging some cultural gaps.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that the view that being Caucasian is good for business in China is a bit naive. Sure, they want to attract foreign investment and present a good side to the world, but that doesn't stop the fact that many locals are still suspicious of the West and many of the smaller towns harbour racist tendencies.",1326176487

Sure, if you write an entire code base depending on its size you may be able to reason about all the side effects in your head.  But when moving to a larger project, or one developed by a team - all bets are off.  It is really important to have the effects embedded in the type system.  Even with a large test suite.<p>On top of this, having professionally written C/C++ for years in the embedded systems space I can say that Monads for IO is not awkward.  In fact, it feels far more powerful because you are not limited to the awful semicolon operator for chaining effects.<p>Lastly FP != slower (even on single core).  I agree Haskell can be hard to reason about performance wise at times due to choosing lazy by default.  However, have you ever heard of Sisal?  Many strict by default FP languages are quite fast, however they sacrifice purity.  But to be honest, with experience Haskell can be damn fast also.",1326176126

(Background: I'm an investment analyst w/ 6 years exp doing some extensive executive compensation analysis)<p>1. I really wish the author did a better job researching the comp plan before writing the article. It wouldn't be hard to contact some compensation experts to get their perspective of the plan...or at least do a better job reading the proxy.<p>For instance: ""This isn't the first time the board has showed its appreciation to Cook for his performance during Jobs' absence. In August, a few days after Cook assumed the role of CEO full time, the board gave Cook 1 million restricted shares of Apple stock, half of which will be vested in five years time.""<p>It's pretty clear in the proxy the $376M compensation includes the August 1M stock grant. This compensation amount should come as no surprise to anyone who paid attention to Apple's August filings on the matter.<p>2. When I first saw the grant in August, I said to myself, ""This grant is uniquely Apple"". You just don't see grants of this size. (Frankly, most companies couldn't get away with a grant of this size.) I'm completely speculating but it looks like the 10 year grant is Apple's way of aligning Cook with an internal 10 year plan. What that 10 year plan consists up is anyone's guess.<p>3. I don't expect to see another large stock grant to Tim Cook for the next 10 years.<p>4. The compensation committee consisted of 2 CEOs and Al Gore. An interesting mix indeed. Makes me think Steve Jobs may have played a role in getting Tim Cook a 10 year grant. Apple now has Bill Campbell on the comp committee and he has extensive experience with tech compensation.<p>5. Overall $376M is a big number and it will interesting to see how it may or may not affect the compensation practices of other tech companies as the compensation consultants do their ""benchmarking"" studies.",1326176120

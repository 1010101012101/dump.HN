8018506,comment,8018049,8018049,1,0,com2kid,,,"> Recently I was choosing my courses for second year and became discouraged at the electives required to continue in the computer science program. I&#x27;m forced to take things that don&#x27;t interest me like psychology, basic marketing, etc. This made me question whether it is even worth spending the money to get a degree when half of the work that I put in won&#x27;t even be relating to my field.<p>Well now it depends.<p>Do you want to be a front line programmer your entire life?<p>Sure, skip taking those courses. Never learn about psychology, after all, what use is knowing how people think, leave that up to someone else. They can figure out what the user&#x27;s want.<p>And hey who needs marketing? I mean you may make the best piece of software in the world, but you don&#x27;t want to actually sell it do you?<p>Those electives are what make for a well rounded person. Writing good code is hard, but engineering software that serves ends users well is a lot harder and requires a lot more knowledge.<p>From understanding cultural issues around the world, to basic principles of design. Having a wide background helps a lot.",1405043977

8018504,comment,8018266,8018266,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"31. Howdy.<p>In your early 20s, you&#x27;re like a girl in college. It&#x27;s very easy to get &quot;activity&quot; (for college girls, sex; for young nerds, jobs with minor but impressive perks) but it&#x27;s really hard to find respect. (I stopped being indignant about gender disparities in dating when I realized that, in terms of getting <i>respect</i>, it was equally hard for men and women.)<p>Your late 20s is when you learn that most employers-- and especially the &quot;prestigious&quot; ones-- never much respected you. You may have been right that you had the right idea or were the smartest one in the room (whilst ignored). It didn&#x27;t matter. You didn&#x27;t have a chance. That enlightenment can be a bit painful.<p>This &quot;mid-career blues&quot; period seems to be the stretch in which a person has learned a few things about what people really are when there&#x27;s enough at stake, but before having enough life experience (or, for the apolitical or fortunate who are able to focus on the work more than the politics, domain mastery) to avoid the obvious pitfalls, deal with obnoxious personalities, and still play the game to a win. The 27-40 period seems to be when people learn their hardest lessons-- first firing or layoff, first non-paying client, first lawsuit, first truly unethical employer. (My friend started consulting and is dealing with his first non-paying client.)<p>The problem, in the US, is that we&#x27;re practically not allowed to talk about what is really going on. The fact that I&#x27;ve been open with some rather vanilla details of my Google experience has made me into some sort of +3-sigma outlier &quot;bad-mouther&quot;. We live in this culture where we&#x27;re supposed to pretend that these negative experiences just don&#x27;t happen. Everyone pretends to be &quot;crushing it&quot; and getting $150,000 signing bonuses and all that bullshit. The result is that the painful experiences of that mid-career spell become isolating, because people are shamed into silence. And that&#x27;s a fucking crime.",1405043902
8018503,comment,8018266,8018358,2,0,Snhr,,,"I&#x27;m 21 now trying to plan out my life and this is one of the major things for me. What do I want to do in life that is important to me and can I accomplish this within the timeframe I have. I don&#x27;t have a second chance so I don&#x27;t want to spend time doing something that I&#x27;ll lose interest in, or end up being stagnant in some job that I can barely stand. I&#x27;d rather do all that worrying now then when it could mean finishing something on time. At least now I can plan accordingly (do this before I&#x27;m x years old) to how much time I&#x27;ve wasted, instead of wasting time and not accomplishing a part of it before I need to.<p>Also trying to figure out how &quot;great&quot; I am, or what I am &quot;great&quot; at. So I&#x27;m not disappointed at myself . I&#x27;ve already gone through that once on several levels when I went from being an old teenager to a young adult. One time is enough, and I bet it&#x27;s so much worse when you&#x27;re at the point where you can&#x27;t accomplish the goal because you&#x27;re not good enough (or even just questioning if its feasible, that has to drop you farther than where you should be and end up doing worse because of it.)<p>Or I may be just wasting time now and I should just jump in. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;ll figure that out. I don&#x27;t need much in life, just to feel like I&#x27;ve done the best that I can at whatever I end up choosing. Not even in an idealistic way really, I want to give back what people have given to me (knowledge, ideas, materialistic things if any) so at most I don&#x27;t leave the world knowing that I did less than nothing. If I leave doing more than I have taken then I can be happy in the fact that I&#x27;ve made the world a little bit better. Not a lot but it wasn&#x27;t a waste being alive.<p>Maybe I should just get a job.",1405043890

8018497,comment,8018049,8018437,4,0,Ologn,,,">The material in a CS degree is pretty accessible for self study<p>Whether or not it is, I have yet to meet anyone who has done self study who has studied theory of computation, mutual exclusion, and that sort of stuff, month on end, like CS students do.  Everyone seems to go straight to what is immediately useful, like the syntax of Objective C and so forth.<p>Also, the big technological leap allowing this was the Gutenberg printing press, not MOOCs and the like.  Theoretically one just needs the textbooks and some other materials to self-study almost any topic.  Yet people have still been going to universities for centuries.  The movable type printing press was the major innovation for this, MOOCs have been relatively minor in comparison to this thus far, yet people have still gone to universities for the past few centuries.<p>> Also of critical importance, CS materials tend to be strongly represented in MOOCs<p>I did not find this to be the case.  Some subjects we went into in class that I did not understand or wanted to look into more indepth, I would go online looking at Youtube videos, MOOCs, various materials etc.  I was usually disappointed.  If I was lucky I would get a poorly shot Youtube video of some professor with a thick foreign accent explaining the subject, often poorly.",1405043803

On top of that you need to pay for all your capital costs.\nThere are other issues, but if this was close to cost effective you would be seeing this in Iceland which gets little sunlight in the winter and has cheap energy costs. Instead they use suplimental lighting inside green houses to boost production.<p>>><p>I thought the vertical stacking makes more efficient use of the light than the single layer you find in a farm or green house. It means that even though the light is produced inefficiently the vertical stacking is intended to cancel out that inefficiency by using the light more efficiently. Moreover, the optimization of the plant&#x27;s exposure to light through automated means adds to increased efficiency in the plant&#x27;s use of the light.<p>If every grower did this, it would (or could) destroy Monsanto&#x27;s business model.

The two things most people get from a degree are the knowledge and the credential.<p>The material in a CS degree is pretty accessible for self study compared to that of some other majors. No expensive materials are required beyond a $500 computer.  Instructors don&#x27;t generally spend time with you while you are actually programming, so you won&#x27;t be missing the kind of 1 on 1 feedback a music major would get.  Also of critical importance, CS materials tend to be strongly represented in MOOCs.  There are already people using Coursera, edX and OCW to complete full degrees (see: <a href=""http://youtu.be/piSLobJfZ3c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/piSLobJfZ3c</a>).<p>As far as credentials go, it&#x27;s a similar story. There are few fields in which the credential matters less than they do in tech jobs. Tons of my friends work at YC companies with either unrelated degrees or none at all.  I personally graduated with a Japanese degree and still managed to break into the industry quickly once I started focusing on developing my hard skills. I received interview offers from pretty much every top tech company in the bay area and the degree never came up. I very, very nearly took one of them but instead chose to do a start-up.  At this point it&#x27;s possible some investor would be hesitant about us because we don&#x27;t CS degrees, but it&#x27;s also probably likely they&#x27;d be interested in our exceptional backgrounds.<p>One caveat to this is is that without the CS degree you have to have the skills. Also I wouldn&#x27;t count too much on being an iOS domain expert since specific tech stacks keep changing. You probably want to learn all the things you&#x27;d get from a CS degree if you don&#x27;t have them already.<p>Unlike a lot of posters here I really don&#x27;t see anything wrong with not getting the degree.  I would strongly suggest that you make a bargain with yourself and save/invest everything you would have spent on college. That will limit your downside and give you the option to stop working and get the degree if you change your mind and/or find your skill-set is no longer in demand. Even if you learn the equivalent of a CS degree on your own, you might find yourself wanting to return and study something like applied math, which pretty much gets you by the credential barrier for any job a CS degree does plus quite a few others.",1405042373

They had some college (Gates had 2 or 3 years at Harvard(?)), but no degree.\nThere is a difference between a trade school, a school that teaches you one specific trade (maybe how to be an electrician (I was), or, in this case programming), and a 4-year college degree. The college degree &quot;broadens&quot; you, not as in fat, but as in understanding and appreciating things outside your specific areas of interest. While many of the non-software courses may seem a waste of time, your knowledge does become wider and you may at some future time find that one of those out-of-major courses actually has some utility and may, help you. I have spent a large portion of my life (in time, effort and money) becoming educated. I have degrees in engineering, biology, and medicine, and I do not regret having any of these degrees. They are all useful and I may actually have too many, but I have been curious all my life and like to learn.\nNow that I am retired, and after 25 years out of software (mostly on military projects), I have taken up the task of studying, learning, and mastering C++. During this past year I have read Bjarne Stroustrup&#x27;s &quot;Programming Principles and Practices using C++&quot; (2009), Lippman&#x27;s &quot;C++ Primer&quot;, 5th edition (2013), and Stroustrup&#x27;s &quot;The C++ Language&quot;, 4th edition (2013). That&#x27;s about 3,000 pages. At this stage, I have achieved the software skills rank of &quot;GrassHopper&quot;.\nSoftware, as used in the fields of computer science and computer engineering, has progressed over the years. First there was coding, then programming, then computer science, then software engineering. The rate of change is increasing.\nYou are a young person. Your resume&#x27; and you reputation are everything and so far you are doing well. You are getting work. But, at some point there will be a job, an opportunity, that will present itself and the applicant MUST have a 4-year college degree. Period! If you do not take the time, while you are young, to get your degree, you will never have a degree. You will miss some opportunity. Every person that you know who has a college degree took the time, expended the effort and money, to &quot;earn&quot; a college degree. You have to make the sacrifice to be able to earn your degree. You are not given a degree. You earn it.\nAs some anecdotal evidence of that, let me describe an event. Everyone knows and respects the Nobel prize winning physicist, the German-born Jew, Albert Einstein. Me, too. But my personal hero is the American-born Jewish mathematician and physicist, Richard P. Feynman. You can learn about Feynman in his biography, &quot;Genius&quot;. He was a mathematical genius and a physics genius. He invented the &quot;Feynman diagram&quot;. At one point, when he was working on his PhD, one of Feynman&#x27;s advisers suggested to Hans Bethe, the senior adviser, that they go ahead and award Feynman his PhD. Bethe responded, &quot;Yes, yes, yes! We all know Feynman is a genius. But, ... has he done the work (for his PhD)?\nSo, ... my young, successful, full-stack software engineer, that is the story. The decision is up to you. I recommend the earning the degree, just like everyone else has.",1405042328

Voting does not affect how much you pay, only how your flat payment is distributed across the publishers in the collective. It is thus impossible to leach. If a subscriber honestly votes &quot;meh&quot; on everything because all the content is (to her) truly meh, then she should probably discontinue her subscription. That is as it should be. The free market mechanism applies not just to comparative success of publishers within this collective, but the collective as a whole. If the collective cannot retain a sufficient number of subscribers, it <i>should</i> fail.<p><i>>Would this encourage publishers to post lots of short articles instead of long thoughtful ones to raise revenues?</i><p>Good point. Clearly we should remove the &quot;if&quot; from my statement about &quot;garbage&quot; votes, which are explicitly designed to penalize any and all gaming, as determined by the subscribers. If subscribers detect such behavior (We would encourage such a critical attitude among the subscriber community culture) they should vote &quot;meh&quot; or &quot;garbage&quot; depending on the degree of offense.<p>But what if those many short articles were actually good? Should five short articles get the same share of subscription fees as one long thoughtful one? I&#x27;d like to leave this in the hands of the subscribers, but also keep the system simple.

Companies went through layoffs in 2008, in 2000-2001, in the early 1990s etc.  What will you do once you&#x27;re married with kids, laid off and then any job opening available needs a college diploma.  Yes, you&#x27;re OK for the next year.  Will you survive the next downturn though, and the one after that?<p>> In addition, during these 3 years I could optimize for my specific niche: iOS development<p>Specialization is good, but you never know what might happen.  Whether or not it&#x27;s likely, it&#x27;s conceivable Android could kill off most iOS jobs in a few years.  At that point a broad underpinning of CS theory and a diploma are helpful.  Will you be doing iOS development 20 years from now?  It&#x27;s hard to say.<p>> kept up with individuals that have over 15 years of experience in the field with degrees<p>Some people get degrees without ever seeming to have learned much.  It&#x27;s not something that should affect your decision one way or the other.  When time gets tough and Craigslist job postings start saying &quot;BSCS required&quot;, an e-mail from you saying that you have &quot;kept up with individuals that have over 15 years of experience in the field with degrees&quot; is not going to mean much.  They&#x27;ll be knee-deep in resumes of people who have a BSCS.  Yours will go right to the waste bin, in many cases.<p>> I&#x27;m forced to take things that don&#x27;t interest me like psychology...half of the work that I put in won&#x27;t even be relating to my field<p>Most of the pioneers of computer science did and do have an interest in human psychology - Marvin Minsky, Noam Chomsky, John McCarthy, Alan Turing and on and on.  I&#x27;m not sure how you came to the conclusion, two years into a CS program and without knowing what the psychology course was teaching, that it was irrelevant to computer science.<p>> Every adult that I talk to (all of whom have degrees) swear by them and say how they&#x27;re such a great fallback but I&#x27;m having a hard time connecting the value, especially in the field of computer science.<p>When the economy goes south, it is better to have a degree than not to.  Also, while theoretically someone can do a program of self study, I&#x27;ve never met anyone without a CS degree who understood pushdown automata, theory of computation and so forth.  It is helpful to have an underlying intellectual framework.  It is possible to be a code monkey who can put together for loops and if statements in PHP or Objective C and so forth, and make money doing it, but an intellectual framework allows people to do more.  I see people self-studying practical things such as learning a programming language, but it&#x27;s very rare for someone to spend months studying theory of computation, or representation of floating point numbers, or formal mathematical definitions of computational complexity, and so forth.  So there are gaps in their knowledge.  They can muddle along, but then one day they will have a critical race condition crashing their program.  As they never studied mutual exclusion, they will only have a vague idea of what will do.  Software in general is famous for mutual exclusion bugs, precisely because so many people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing can jerry rig for loops and if loops together to get something going, but have no deeper understanding of theory, architecture and so forth.",1405041688

To me this is how we wasted 10 years trying to XML-ify everything.<p>Specifically, your arguments rest on the vague and indefinable quality of &quot;enlightenment.&quot;  I think that this use of &quot;enlightenment&quot; means something along the lines of &quot;I got something to work within a thought framework that appeals to me.&quot;  But if he had started with a different framework (like RPC), he could have gotten that to work too, and perhaps would be feeling the &quot;RPC enlightenment&quot; because all of these problems can be solved within RPC too.<p>No one is arguing that HTTP-based APIs can only do CRUD.  You can tunnel basically anything over HTTP, because ultimately the payload is just bytes.  But the question is what using HTTP (and/or REST) has actually <i>bought</i> you, compared to competing approaches.<p>Graydon Hoare (one of the original authors of Rust) wrote an essay about this a while ago that I really love.  Unfortunately he took it off the net, but it&#x27;s still available on the wayback machine: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20040308200432/http://www.venge.net/graydon/markup-abuse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20040308200432/http://www.venge.n...</a><p>The essay is written in a very whimsical and wandering style, but the point is dead on:<p><pre><code>    If you want to store or transmit a message, you can do\n    cryptography, steganography, normalized database tables,\n    huffman codes, elliptic curves, web pages, morse code,\n    semaphores, java bytecode, bit-mapped images, wavelet\n    coefficients, s-expressions, basically anything you can\n    possibly dream up which codes for some bits. In all cases,\n    if you&#x27;re coding bits and you are using a lossless system,\n    the *only* thing which matters is how *convenient* the encoding\n    is. There&#x27;s nothing which makes one encoding &quot;do it better&quot;\n    than any other, aside from various external measurements of\n    convenience such as size, speed of encoding, speed of\n    decoding, hand-editability, self-consistency, commonality,\n    etc.\n</code></pre>\nHTTP/REST and XML inhabit slightly different design spaces, so for HTTP/REST some of the external measurements might be a bit different. But if you are trying to argue that REST is better than competing technologies, the question is: what objective benefits does it offer, compared to those other technologies?<p>Clearly there are benefits to REST/HTTP (being able to use a web browser as an ad-hoc UI in many cases is one), but the idea of &quot;enlightenment&quot; should not be a substitute for an actual compare/contrast of approaches.<p>So yes, of course the author <i>could</i> find a solution to his problems that still used HTTP.  The question is: once he does this, is he better off than if he had chosen a competing technology? (imagining a world where you aren&#x27;t effectively forced to use HTTP to make it through firewalls).",1405040407

It&#x27;s not surprising that we see it all the time in online discussions,as it&#x27;s become the new way of being &quot;reasonable&quot;.<p>In Australia we are having a debate about immigration. The actual debate is over the treatment of refugees (or &quot;Illegal Immigrants&quot; as the government calls them) that arrive by boat. The refugees (sorry &quot;Illegal Immigrants&quot;) who arrive by boat are treated <i>very</i> differently from those that arrive by plane. In the last few decades, the refugees who arrive by boat aren&#x27;t even just &quot;Illegal Immigrants&quot; anymore, they&#x27;re &quot;Boat People&quot;. And we need to &quot;Stop The Boats&quot;.<p>So, in less than 20 years, we&#x27;ve reduced the words &quot;Boat&quot; and &quot;People&quot; into snarling invective that the masses can spit at each other in self justifying jingoism.<p>I agree that the &quot;substantive points&quot; in any statement are the ones that need to be considered, but if the majority of a country can be persuaded to be in fear of &quot;People&quot; who arrive on &quot;Boats&quot;, then we need to recognise that the delivery is just as important as the substance.<p>When we live in a society where &quot;tone&quot; itself can cause offense, then &quot;tone policing&quot; is probably, although unfortunately, justified.",1399118265

7690427,comment,7689836,7690155,1,0,Theodores,,,"> What&#x27;s the likely solution here?<p><i>Turn your computer off</i>. The CO2 that acidified that ocean came from the fossil fuels + oxygen that were burned to make the power needed to build that wind turbine that powers your computer. So, if you want to save the life of a snail, turn off your computer. And stop breathing.<p>Instead of having a &#x27;war on terror&#x27; and a trillion dollar arms trade we could get serious about greening this planet, as in planting green things that look pretty, take in CO2 and breathe out oxygen. If we set our minds to it and found some political will we could do it, to create a true paradise on earth and not have this fear of climate change. We could steward this planet whichever way we wanted rather than always going for the tragedy of the commons and electing the evil, corrupt, lying retards such as the politicians we have.<p>I thought we had reached the turning point (of no turning back) about 15 years ago when action would have been worthwhile. But, since then we have gone the other way, hit on fracking and decided to go for mass die-off.<p>Are we to be no better than bacteria on a petri dish, to bloom exponentially, hit resource depletion and die off? Is that it? Arthur C Clarke and Carl Sagan had us conquering new worlds rather than just assuming the zombie apocalypse will miss our generation.",1399117902

I think it should only be possible to ask for refunds if the creator doesn’t make a good faith effort.<p>I understand that Kickstarter wants to draw a clear and unambiguous line, but I also think that one of things that makes Kickstarter great is the potential for failure. It’s not just a boring pre-order service – or at least I don’t want it to be, at least not exclusively.<p>The potential for failure is already the current reality of Kickstarter but I always feel as though they try to absolve themselves from it. I think they should instead communicate it offensively.<p>Kickstarter can remain a place for boring pre-orders (those projects can be awesome, too, e.g. Smut Peddler).<p>However, Kickstarter could also create a clearly marked higher risk type of project. The product doesn’t exist at the start of the funding period (either completely or nearly completely). Kickstarter could require creators to be more transparent with their budget. Maybe there could also be a, say, $2,500 ceiling for each individual backer or something like that. But Kickstarter could also allow for failure without refunds.<p>I think all of this is doable. People who don’t like risk can still back low-risk pre-order Kickstarters, people who enjoy backing something that could fail can do just that.<p>(That being said, the linked project appears to have been fraudulent and no good faith effort appears to have been made, so it’s certainly appropriate to get the courts involved.)",1399117799

Google is just another part. The set of LAWS that have been up there and been built for the past 200-300 years made it clear that Goverments are above those Laws and can do anything they like.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t Google tracking your data, it would be someone else doing it cause thats how the world that they setted up  works!\nDo you think Google is happy with handing out info to goverments? No, its done cause they are forced to, and yes they can ask something in exchange.

7690374,comment,7688700,7689962,4,0,ubernostrum,,,"So, this was in the early, early days of Django with the old ORM and the old forms system (which went by the name of &quot;manipulators&quot;), though the bug persisted past the ORM rewrite, since it was actually in the forms system.<p>When a &quot;manipulator&quot; was creating or modifying an ORM model instance, it would need to figure out which fields from the model and, sometimes, which fields from related (via foreign-key or many-to-many relations) models to include.<p>For related models, the code would generate a dictionary, called &quot;follow&quot;, listing the fields to, well, follow across the relation and include in the manipulator. The method &quot;get_manipulator_fields()&quot; on the class representing the related object would then iterate over its own fields, and if a field name turned up in the &quot;follow&quot; dictionary it would add that one to the under-construction list of fields for the manipulator.<p>Except sometimes that code would crash with an exception: &quot;AttributeError: &#x27;bool&#x27; object has no attribute &#x27;get&#x27;&quot;. This was rather puzzling, and although there did seem to be patterns to <i>when</i> it would happen, it wasn&#x27;t always possible to consistently reproduce it.<p>That two-line fix came from realizing that the exception was a symptom of an underlying problem: it was coming from a situation where the name of a foreign-key field on one model was the same as the internal-bookkeeping name Django had generated for another model class. In that case, and only in that case, the manipulator-generating code would get confused and end up on the wrong code path, which is how get_manipulator_fields() was receiving a boolean argument where it expected a dictionary (this was compounded by the fact that everything which could end up adding fields to a manipulator did so via a method of that name).<p>So the fix was to ensure that in the code which handled related objects, Django would always use a name that couldn&#x27;t conflict and throw the manipulator code down the wrong path.<p>Of course, not long after that the manipulator system was ripped out and replaced with the much-saner django.forms module.",1399116787

Last time (5-6 different Google recruiters over the last 6-7 years) I went through phone screening with the recruiter after she was very convincing when telling me why this time would be different (after I&#x27;d given her my &quot;standard&quot; paragraph by e-mail about why I generally think talking to Google is a waste of my time). This was for a management position, and she then got me set up for  technical interview.<p>The guy in question gave me a bunch of totally idiotic questions about details about filesystem implementations, and clearly didn&#x27;t like it when I pointed out to him that there wasn&#x27;t one single answer to the questions he raised the way he&#x27;d asked them, and proceeded to give him an outline of the various solutions that applied for a few different filesystems. He wanted specific textbook details about a filesystem that was entirely irrelevant for the position.<p>My impression was that he was &quot;textbook smart&quot;, and would answer questions about the specific stuff he&#x27;d studied very well - the questions he asked fit very well with that -, and would probably excel at brainteasers, but his interpersonal skills and broader understanding of the subjects he asked me about appeared to be so weak that had I been on the other side of the table, I&#x27;d never have considered hiring him.<p>I &quot;failed&quot; that interview, only to have the recruiter bring it up in some recruitment committee or something and get it set aside and get me through to the next step on the basis of the notes I sent her of all the issues I saw with the questions. But only after she spent a lot of time lamenting the process (this is a common team with Google recruiters - every one I&#x27;ve spoken to has been incredibly frustrated at their own processes).<p>But by then I&#x27;d lost interest - the guy in question was in the group I&#x27;d have managed, and I really did not like the thought of having to deal with him on a daily basis. Or the thought of a team staffed with similar people... Or the thought of working somewhere where the HR processes are so messed up that their recruiters spends half the time they talk to me apologising about how their recruitment works.<p>I know there are lots of great people at Google, but every interaction I&#x27;ve had with their recruitment process makes me less inclined to want to work there.",1399116627

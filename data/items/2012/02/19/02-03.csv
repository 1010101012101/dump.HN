3608505,comment,3606784,3607250,5,0,cynicalkane,,,"You're at least wrong about the prohibition thing. Prohibition was enacted via amendment because it occurred before Wickard v Filburn, which held that Congress has powers to regulate intrastate commercial activity as part of a program of interstate commerce. This extends to drugs (obvious example: Gonzales v Raich)<p>Now you're going to say that Wickard is unconstitutional, but that constitutes a libertarian-fundamentalist rewriting of how American jurisprudence works. Maybe you think it ought to be unconstitutional, but when you say it ""is"" unconstitutional you're not telling the truth, you're telling us what you think and pretending it's the truth.<p>There's a whole bunch else about your post that's plainly wrong or misleading (the stuff about the gold coins for instance) but I omit them for the sake of brevity. In general your post is a rant. I see you posting a lot about libertarianism when it's off-topic, uncalled for, or perhaps called for but you're wrong anyway. Finally I think the tolerance and celebration of these views--hardcore, far-out, and relatively uninformed--in the tech community is a discrediting force when it comes to actually fighting the content industry.",1329620390

Suffice it to say, you can't walk and buy something knowing what you want.  You are forced to wait for some sales person.  More than a half hour into the experience, we simply left.  My brother-in-law was sitting there, ready to buy.  He knew exactly what he wanted.  We left, and he never made the purchase.<p>So, when I read things like this, all I see is a sales person who just wasted another customers time. Sure, it's policies, and you are spending that time with a potential customer, and treating them well.  The point, however, is I've had better experiences buying Apple products from places like FutureShop, where I can walk in, explain what I want, pay, and walk out in less than 5 minutes.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm sure for the majority of people this is... fine (I guess).

But knowledge does not equal production, and whether you or I or anyone else here wants to admit it, a tremendous amount of stuff has been invented, either totally, or almost totally, as a component of university research.</i><p>I don't mind admitting some useful things have come out of universities. But this doesn't mean we need to continue propping up the university system as it exists today. You admit it has many flaws. There are plenty of ways to bring smart people together to learn and do research. They could be nonprofit; they could be separate from teaching or integrated with it. You could even call them ""universities"" if you like. But there's no reason they have to resemble the current monster.<p><i>True, most research in universities is either pointless or close to pointless, but that's the Zipf curve. The ideas that are big are really, really big.</i><p>Sure, but the university system isn't sold that way. We're meant to believe the research done in universities is all useful.<p><i>People come from all over the world to study here, and when they do, they sometimes stay here. Do people come to America to study at libraries?</i><p>Universities have special privileges when it comes to fostering immigration. If America had world-class research centers with the same privileges, people would still love to come here and they'd be able to do so.<p><i>The last thing I wanted to point out is that the fact that libraries are a useful repository of knowledge does not mean that it will make people productive. Universities are not good at this either, but the consistent usership of public libraries is pitifully small. The fact that they exist does not mean that people will use them.</i><p>As you point out, universities aren't very good at this. Maybe a lot of people won't use libraries, and many who do won't be very productive. But as you suggested in one of your other points, the instances that pay off <i>really</i> pay off.

My point is, insurance is not all the same.  You may find the better doctors unwilling to see you depending on the brand of insurance you have.<p>(3) If you do something like, for example, breaking your ankle, you'll be shocked at how much stuff is <i>not</i> covered by insurance.  So add 50% to your out of pocket estimates.  This is for things like: parking at the ortho / physical therapist office ($5-$8 per visit; 30+ visits, $200), taxis to and from work since you can't take public transport ($34 / day, 6 months on crutches, $4k), drugs (typically separate from the insurance deductible for no reason but to screw more money out of you, $300), buying all OTC stuff you can get at any drug store which is therefore not covered (advil, ice packs, compression bandages, etc -- easily $200).  Plus if you actually have a bad accident, you'll probably spend a couple thousand dollars on takeout, etc.<p>(4) deductibles reset on a calendar basis.  I fortunately injured myself in march and had 8 months of treatment, with both surgeries covered in the same deductible year.  If you were to hurt yourself in October, you could cross deductible years so double your out of pocket costs again.<p>(5) Also, you should be very careful about coverage restrictions and in/out of network bullshit.  As I mentioned, I broke my ankle.  When you have an injury like that, you don't want to go to a random orthopaedic surgeon.  I was fortunate and Anthem Blue Cross covered UCSF so I could go to an ortho surgeon who only repairs ankles instead of a generic ortho surgeon.  The difference is between someone who has treated my particular injury 600+ times vs someone who has done so a handful of times.  Lots of research suggests that outcomes correlate with the amount of times your doctor has treated your injury.<p>My experience was a bit unusual because the recovery time -- 8 months -- was so protracted, but not unprecedented for joint injuries.  Recommendation: don't break your ankle =P<p>tl:dr: in a worst case scenario, where you have a moderate to bad injury that spans a deductible year, your $10K can be $25K in practice.

3608444,comment,3608264,3608286,4,0,antics,,,"If there are plenty of other things to cut first, why are we comparing the two? Why not complain that they should cut something else instead of universities?<p>I know the answer to this, and it makes me a bit sad. It's easy for Americans to resent their university system because, at least in CS, it is arguable that they don't actually need it. In some cases, it even <i>hurts</i> American kids. But before we all jump on this bandwagon (again) let's consider that we are perhaps being a bit myopic.<p>In the first place, libraries are a great repository of knowledge. But knowledge does not equal production, and whether you or I or anyone else here wants to admit it, a <i>tremendous</i> amount of stuff has been invented, either totally, or almost totally, as a component of university research. What would the world be without transactional databases, A* search, quicksort, cryptography, the idea of programming languages and so on <i>ad infinatum</i>. I could probably fill up literally a whole book listing the things in CS that were invented at Universities. There are more for other fields. You might contend that they all would have been invented eventually, but the question still remains: what would the world look like if universities had not been around to foster these ideas? New ideas need friends, and Bell labs can't employ <i>all</i> the geniuses.<p>I know, I know, you might contend that most research in universities is either pointless or close to pointless. Unfortunately, you'd be right. But remember, that's the Zipf curve. The ideas that are big are <i>really, really</i> big. Not just in universities, either: ideas produced by universities (for example, the ones I listed above) have changed the way that the world operates at a fundamental level, and they continue to do this. And when people come to universities and engage in work related to it, they carry it home, they carry it to their job, and they carry it out of the country. This is the way the world works. I know HN hates this opinion, but it is true.<p>The other thing I want to mention is that the <i>vast</i> majority of these life-changing ideas come out of <i>American</i> universities. This is a truly global system now. People come from all over the world to study here, and when they do, they sometimes stay here. Do people come to America to study at libraries? The simple and fact of the matter is that not all talented people are born in the US, and American universities are a very important gateway to get talented people into the US. In contrast, the library system is a purely domestic product for the public that happens to be inside US. I know that you think that universities don't ""help the poor"", but consider that this is really only true for the domestic poor. They are an irreplaceable resource for the poor outside. I'm not pitting ""our"" poor against ""their"" poor, but it's just something to think about.<p>The last thing I wanted to point out is that the fact that libraries are a useful repository of knowledge does not mean that it will make people productive. Universities are not good at this either, but the consistent usership of public libraries is pitifully small. The fact that they exist does not mean that people will use them, since they do exist, and people clearly mostly do not.<p>The bottom line is this: your points all have some grain of truth to them, or they are true outright. But when you don't bother to examine <i>why</i> this system exists to begin with before you state that another systems should be preferred, you are undermining your own point in a huge way. In particular, to say that we should toss an incredibly important and <i>global</i> system for some domestic system that people don't use is utterly wrong. That all said, the correct answer is: cut neither, and instead cut part of the military.",1329618308

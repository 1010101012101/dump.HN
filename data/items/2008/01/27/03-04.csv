104858,comment,104663,104663,0,0,trevelyan,,,"This is a puff piece (""things have unintended consequences"" is as pablum as it gets).<p>The anti-environmental slant implicit in the piece is intellectually offensive. If land is in the hands of developers with plans for real estate development, the wildlife is already screwed. That doesn't mean tanking environmental regulations is somehow ""better"" for wildlife.<p>Ceteris paribus, this article sucks.",1201405935

No rhyme or reason.  Building 1 was next to Building 9, which connected to Building 42.  For the important buildings, they were named after famous ex-directors.  They were building a new building, and I decided to name it after my roommate (who is no director), Ian Montoya (name changed), who also worked there.<p>The whole campus is connected via walkways between buildings, so you can walk to the cafeteria from your office without going outside.  So, you often ended up walking with other employees on your way to lunch.  What Ian and I would do when we found ourselves in a cluster was to act out a scripted conversation as if it was normal conversation:<p><pre><code>  me: did you hear about that new building they're building?\n  Ian: You mean BUILDING 23?\n  me: yeah, THAT'S THE ONE.\n  Ian: Yeah, what about it?\n  me: I hear that they're going to call it the Ian Montoya Building.\n  Ian: The IAN MONTOYA BUILDING?\n  me: Yeah, the IAN MONTOYA BUILDING.\n  Ian: huh, I should remember that, the IAN MONTOYA BUILDING.\n</code></pre>\nI'd correct people when they mentioned it, at meetings, in the hallways, at lunch, hoping it'd spread, but alas, I only was able to get the new hires to call it that.<p>The only other one off the top of my head is a small one.  From June until April of next year, whenever people would ask, I'd tell them my birthday was on April 1st.  I also changed it on friendster, and other places mentioning my birthday that friends would see.  Come April 1st, I got a couple calls for my birthday.  ""Happy Birthday!"" they'd say, and I'd go, ""Thanks!  April Fools!""  After that, I had to convince them that I wasn't joking.",1201405254

The other arbitrary stuff, like the friend limit and Scoble's questionable grammar, are are worth dealing with.<p>But why in the hell was Scoble at Davos?",1201403982

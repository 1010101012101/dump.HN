8581857,comment,8579940,8579940,0,0,Pxtl,,,"I love databases, but I loathe SQL.  And no, I don&#x27;t mean NoSQL is better - that&#x27;s throwing out the baby with the bathwater.<p>To me, SQL is the Common Lisp of relational languages - a brilliant invention of its time that has since long-overstayed its welcome and should be replaced by modern considerations of the problem it solves.  The difference is that there are a million rethinks and descendents and redesigns of LISP out there that happily threw out the mistakes and made great strides in the language.  You could argue that <i>every</i> modern programming language is a descendant of Lisp thanks to the prevalence of great concepts like lexical closures.  SQL, on the other hand, has a teeny tiny few spiritual fringe descendents like the various attempts at Date and Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Tutorial D&quot;.<p>I love the relational model, but who says the only way to manage the relational model is this hoary old thing?  It&#x27;s immensely frustrating that every implementation of SQL bolts on a tacky and half-assed procedural language, but doesn&#x27;t solve simple underlying frustrations.<p>Simply accessing related objects is immensely wordy for a &quot;relational&quot; language.  In an algol-derived language, I can say Group.Manager.Person.Address.PostalCode to walk the graph.  In SQL, I have to deal with a zillion joins.<p>Yes, some SQL variants let you join by the foreign key name to make the join a little more terse, but it&#x27;s still hairy compared to every modern functional or procedural language.<p>And the APIs - maybe the reason so many sites have SQL injection problems is the hideous APIs.  Ever tried to build a WHERE IN (id1, id2, id3... idN) statement with a proper parametrized queries?  Holy crap what a icky mass of boiler plate.  I mean, it&#x27;s not a <i>hard</i> problem, but how many times have you solved it, and how many times have you found a tedious bug in your solution?  Just give me a proper way to concatenate the parametrization <i>inline</i> with the query FFS.<p><pre><code>  db.RunQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    SELECT * \n    FROM MYTABLE \n    WHERE ID IN + &quot; + db.SomeParameterListFunc(a, b, c) + &quot; \n    ORDER BY HOLYCRAP_WAS_THAT_SO_HARD&quot;\n  &quot;&quot;&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nThe above syntax would be trivial in any language with operator overloading on the &quot;+&quot; sign, on the off chance that your SQL dialect is so messy it&#x27;s impossible to safely build a properly-escaped initializer for the list containing a,b and c in text form.<p>And that&#x27;s not even getting into real actual first-class language support like ORMs give you.<p>And speaking of APIs, the fact that a single &quot;SELECT&quot; is the baseline operation... that you work on one resultset at a time.  I don&#x27;t want a single pile of rows.  This is not an excel spreadsheet, it&#x27;s a relational database, and that means I want a <i>graph</i> of data.  I don&#x27;t want to write three queries to get my Customers, their Personnel, and their Addresses, nor do I want a single row of CustomerPersonnelAdddresses.  Once and Only Once is good for the data, why the heck isn&#x27;t it good for result sets?<p>Where&#x27;s the code reuse?  Why can&#x27;t I have a pile of SELECTs and a pile of WHEREs and combine them however I see fit?  Oh right, I can use a VIEW... but see the previous point, a VIEW is a single glorified Excel spreadsheet, not a proper graph of data.  If I want to bundle a bunch of SELECTs together, I have to just write a stored procedure, but then I can&#x27;t use the proc with a JOIN statement against my VIEW that provides a custom WHERE clause.  You could do something monstrous with table-valued parameters, I guess, but those aren&#x27;t generally well-supported at the API level.  This is not a hard problem in every modern language (except Go, of course - yes, you <i>do</i> freaking need map/reduce/filter).<p>Namespaces.  Real, actual, organizational tools for your giant list of 9000 tables and their related objects.  No, schemas don&#x27;t freaking count - you can&#x27;t nest them and they&#x27;re overly tied to the security model - using schemas for organization instead of security leads to madness, besides the fact that you can&#x27;t nest them.<p>And of course, so many common problems simply <i>aren&#x27;t</i> nice to work with using the relational model.  How do I make a nice audited row where I have the full history of all the row&#x27;s changes?  Well, I can insert it every time, but that&#x27;s a lot of wasted space.  Yes, again, there are ways to do this, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d expect to come out-of-the-box since it&#x27;s such a common problem.  Common problems should be solved by the standard library.  But SQL can&#x27;t solve things like this with the standard library, because a SQL standard libraries are limited to crude things like functions and views and procs and not actual large-scale reusable constructs.  It&#x27;s like a programming language where they gave you a bunch of general tools for manipulating unicode points and dynamically sized arrays but no coherent &quot;string&quot; object.<p>Or <i>trees</i>.  Holy crap, you have a &quot;relational&quot; database where a relationship like a &quot;tree&quot; is a nightmare to actually query out!  I know that&#x27;s not what &quot;relational&quot; means, but still - this ins&#x27;t exactly a rare edge-case, y&#x27;know?  But it&#x27;s not in the standard library because the standard library is limited to crude objects like data-types, functions, procedures, etc. that work below the row-level.  Any concept of reusable <i>schema</i> concepts is completely left off the table.<p>/rant",1415588889

8581852,comment,8580996,8581502,0,0,jofer,,,"Great question!<p>In a nutshell, it&#x27;s because we choose minerals whose crystal structure can only bond with the original element and not with it&#x27;s &quot;daughter&quot; that&#x27;s produced after radioactive decay.<p>For example, Uranium/Lead dating of zircons is one of the most common methods (particularly for very old rocks).  There&#x27;s a reason we use zircons for uranium/lead dating, and not just any mineral that contains trace amounts uranium.<p>In zircon (ZrSiO4), uranium can (and does, in small amounts) substitute for zirconium in the crystal structure and bond with the silica tetrahedra.  However, lead cannot bond with the silica tetrahedra in zirconium&#x27;s place.  Therefore, the zircon crystal structure &quot;rejects&quot; lead, and any lead in the crystal lattice at the present day must be the result of radioactive decay.<p>If we know the rate of radioactive decay of the uranium isotopes in question (there are two uranium isotopes that decay to two different lead isotopes), all we need to date the rock is the present-day ratio of a particular uranium isotope to the corresponding lead isotope.<p>In practice, you also exploit the fact that there are two uranium isotopes that independently decay to two different lead isotopes.  This gives two independent dates, and disagreements between them can be use to test for contamination, etc.  (There are also a few other checks I won&#x27;t get into... I&#x27;m not a geochronologist, and each different isotopic system and instrument used to measure it has slightly different protocols. Reality is messy, but this gives the basic picture.)",1415588742

So you can date an organism by when it stopped taking in new carbon, i.e. when it died.<p>For other, longer-lived isotopes, keep in mind you are not just measuring the amount of radioactive material <i>left</i>, but are also measuring the amount of the daughter product mixed in some proportion with it. And the proportions in the material being dated might not be the same as what they are in the surrounding environment (in fact, can not be, if the dating method is going to work). As a simple example, you could date rocks with uranium and lead, since you would expect there to be more lead in old rocks because some of the uranium decayed to lead. However, if that rock melted and mixed with younger rocks, the proportion of lead and uranium would cease to be of any interest.",1415588468

4976646,comment,4976453,4976453,7,0,AYBABTME,,,"I was an infantry officer deployed in Afghanistan with the Canadian Forces when I found myself hacking VB(A) programs to relief me off my HQ charge.  Then I ended up automating all of my HQ's stations such that nobody had to do anything anymore.  The things I made were so ugly [1,2,3], it's laughable.  But they were very functional, in comparison to the crap we were supposed to use, and for which the Army had paid millions of dollars.<p>I was reserve.  I tried to transfer reg forces (full time) during my tour, but budget compressions left no position available for me to fill.  Meanwhile, I received recognition for the work I had done [4].<p>So in spite of my failure to transfer full-time infantry officer, I realized a quite credible alternative would be to actually code things for a living, since anyway that's what I end up doing when I'm thrown in a giant sandbox.<p>When I came back to Canada, I enlisted in a Software Engineering undergraduate program.  I'm 2 years in, this Summer will be my first COOP term (out of 4) and I've succeeded in getting an offer to intern with Amazon.<p>Life is strange.  I was quite disappointed that I couldn't transfer to reg force.  It's quite a blessing, in retrospective.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21733074/Project/blog-post-afgh-tools/incident_manager/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-27%20at%208.34.13%20PM.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21733074/Project/blog-post-afgh-too...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21733074/Project/blog-post-afgh-tools/j3_avn_helper/overview.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21733074/Project/blog-post-afgh-too...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21733074/Project/blog-post-afgh-tools/incident_manager/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-27%20at%208.38.42%20PM.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21733074/Project/blog-post-afgh-too...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21733074/Pics/AIR%20WING%20COMD%20COMMENDATION%20-%20LT%20GRONDIN%20-%20Aug%202010.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21733074/Pics/AIR%20WING%20COMD%20C...</a>",1356674135

4976637,comment,4976475,4976475,5,0,pixie_,,,"That's really awesome. Lately I've been a fan of a Static+API architecture where the site content is served static and dynamic content is loaded through an API call to api.mysite.com and bound using an MVVM. With caching set, static content is never re-requested and API calls are immediately made when a user loads a page. My server can be a simple event io platform like node, and can handle more requests because it's not building dynamic pages, just directly getting data from the db or memcache to serve back json. Unit testing is simplified because my tests are all integration tests against the same API my webpages use. I can write test scripts to create new users, login, run features and verify the JSON results. Basically use my site from the commandline if I want to, or provide 3rd party api support with no extra effort. I'm not a fan of rest urls mixing data with content requests so I use query params to specify the data to request in the api call. Like homework.com/assignment?id=324324 - when the page loads (immediately from cache) the javascript reads the id and makes the API call to get the content. Anyone else using this kind of design?",1356673916

Most of my list actually attaches to that or is proximate to it, so it's not like you'd have a huge pile of equipment spread all over the place.<p>The cage itself is good for squats, rack pulls, shrugs, high-racked overhead press (as opposed to cleaned presses), and bench press, among others.  The safety pins can be used for additional protection where the bar might put you at risk, especially in squats and bench press.  Most cages will have a high bar suitable for chin-ups, if not one can generally be added.  Similarly a dips attachment.  An adjustable pulley gives you the added flexibility of a cable station allowing for pulls with resistance at different orientations (high, low, mid).  With front racks, you can work outside the cage while still racking the bar onto it, much as you would with your bar stand.  Bumper plates and a platform allow for Oly lifts, which are great for developing not just power but strength (you can do Oly lifts without these, but it's safer and easier on your equipment if you do have them).<p>You can also set up a rack for use with bands, chains, or both, to change and target your training.

I'm not religious--I don't believe in general ethical principles either. I'm a particularist. If I were a consistent particularist, I wouldn't advance the general principle not to listen to advice from anyone who has an interest in giving it. I would suggest asking if they were disinterested or not, and to what extent. It's my observation that most of the advice one receives isn't disinterested--but I could be mistaken. For that reason, I have a preference for the advice of the dead, but certainly not all advice they have to give, and mostly for the moral lessons of art and literature--not necessarily explicit guides to conduct.<p>As a particularist, I would avoid following general principles of conduct in every case, since these do not work in the generality they claim.

But this time, I had to keep the ship in a very specific position, to make sure the captain could see his men now on a potentially hostile vessel, we had intel that they were a mother ship for the cartel's cigarette boats. 450' ship vs a 150' ship, with 6 degrees of freedom each, rough seas, sundown, and I was off by 10 feet.

This time, looking at a patient's dura mater, and trying to sneak around to the other side, seeing the wrong rongeur, his head didn't even move.

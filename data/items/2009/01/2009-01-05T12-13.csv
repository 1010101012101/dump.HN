420341,comment,419895,420025,0,0,gjm11,,,"So what, for you, distinguishes ""opinions"" from ""facts""? Can you give some examples of opinion-easily-mistaken-for-fact in ordinary English and explain what makes them harder to express in E-prime than other sentences of ordinary English? (Or, if you think that misses the point, what makes their E-prime equivalents less likely to spring to the mind of someone writing in E-prime?)<p>People often express aesthetic judgements as factual statements, and perhaps they shouldn't; so let's take some examples and see how they go into E-prime.<p>""Bach is the greatest composer who ever lived"" means much the same as ""No other composer wrote such great music as Bach did"". That didn't feel at all difficult, and the E-prime version contains just as much opinion, which looks just as much like fact, as the E-notprime version.<p>""The Mona Lisa is overrated"" means much the same as ""Most people rate the Mona Lisa's merits more highly than it really deserves"". Again, expressing that sentiment in E-prime gives no difficulty, and the E-prime version has the same problems as the E-notprime version while using more words.<p>Perhaps we should look at politics rather than the arts?<p>""The Republicans are concerned only to feather their own and their benefactors' nests"": this one requires scarcely any change, and I might very easily have happened to express it in E-prime without trying. ""The Republicans want to feather their own and their benefactors' nests, and don't care about anything else.""<p>""Barack Obama is a charlatan whose only real skill is persuasive oratory."" Well, ""is a charlatan"" doesn't go easily into E-prime, but one can say ""Barack Obama's success in politics results entirely from his persuasive oratory, despite the false impression to the contrary that he is careful to give"", and as usual the translation gives little trouble and preserves the undesirable features of the original.<p>So, I dunno, but it doesn't seem to me as if writing in E-prime makes it easier for opinions to look like facts. Would you care to enlighten me?<p>Remark: all of the above (apart from examples in quotation marks) is in E-prime, unless I goofed, and by far the most difficult thing to say without the copula was the first sentence of the second paragraph; and in fact ""perhaps they shouldn't"" (which I would in fact regard as opinion-easily-mistaken-for-fact) was the best I could do to replace things like ""arguably aesthetic judgements are matters of opinion rather than fact"". This may of course just indicate that I'm not good at writing in E-prime, but I do find it interesting that the main effect of doing so was to <i>introduce</i> an opinion-as-fact problem.",1231159615
420340,comment,419895,420051,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Passive sentences don't have some sort of intrinsic <i>enjoyability</i>, <i>you</i> enjoy them. E-Prime makes that distinction clearer. That's what the wikipedia article tried to say as ""Using E-Prime makes it harder for a writer or reader to confuse statements of opinion with statements of fact."": it makes opinions harder to pass off as a statement about an intrinsic essence.

Which particular anti-abortion, pro-war, pro-Drug War, traditionalist, or otherwise <i>conservative</i> articles were you referring to?<p>I think it's really funny that when you see some viewpoints with which you disagree, it is because some big, anonymous agglomeration (""Conservatives!"") must be abusing their freedom of speech by saying things with which many HN readers agree (and your solution -- telling an <i>actual</i> big, anonymous agglomeration to push their viewpoints here -- just seems to exacerbate the problem). A few other points:<p><i>In Conservatism, the purpose of people is to serve The Market.</i><p>What does it mean to 'serve' the market? The market is an abstraction -- you can't make 'it' better or worse-off, though you can do that to participants.<p><i>Our unregulated Conservative markets</i><p>You're referring to how the unregulated hedge funds produced much worse returns than the highly-regulated commercial- and investment-banking industries -- and how the only safe spot in the current financial turmoil is the highly-regulated, government-created, government-subsidized mortgage industry, right? <i>Right</i>?<p><i>Mississippi and Alabama have Conservative state governments, and have practically no startup activity. Massachusetts and New York are not Conservative, which makes them capable of spawning MIT and Silicon Alley.</i><p>Has it not occurred to you that you have the cause and effect wrong, here? New York and California can have more abusive governments because even if you pay 50% of your marginal income in taxes, you're <i>still</i> better off starting a startup in CA than in Mississippi, or trading derivatives in New York rather than Alabama.<p><i>What happened when we had sky-high taxes on rich people, and highly regulated markets?</i><p>Some day, you will be introduced to the term 'loophole'. You will wonder why the three-martini lunch and the company car used to be so common, and are now so rare. You will run the numbers on the Reagan tax cuts and find that the reduction in nominal rates would imply gigantic cuts in total income received, which is not what happened -- and then you'll realize that, in general, tax cuts are accompanied by loophole-closing, and tax increases are accompanied by loophole creation. That's just how things work.<p>Thank you for linking to Paul Krugman, well-known as the first person to be awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize for his political rants in a popular newspaper, rather than his academic papers. I haven't actually read what the prize committee said about him, but everyone I've met who agrees with Krugman's polemics seems to see the prize as new evidence in their favor, so I am assuming that this is what the award was for.

420337,comment,420183,420310,0,0,chaostheory,,,"the main problem with Social Security isn't really changes in population size (though it still is a problem). The core problem of Social Security is this:<p>""Taxes paid by today’s workers are used to pay today’s retirees. If money is left over, it finances other government spending—though, to maintain the insurance fiction, paper entries are created in a “trust fund” that is simultaneously an asset and a liability of the government. When the benefits that are due exceed the proceeds from payroll taxes, as they will in the not very distant future, the difference will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing, creating money, or reducing other government spending.""<p>Basically politicians (of both parties) raid the Social Security fund and just leave IOU notes behind to fund their pork projects. If the money was untouchable and only used for Social Security, the problems we'd see with just population changes wouldn't be nearly as bad... hence (I could be wrong but I feel) this is one of the core arguments that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.",1231159157

Guess they figured out that here they could promote their agenda for free.<p>Is that really what Hacker News wants to be? A political forum? If so, I'll encourage the folks at Media Matters, Center for American Progress, and Campaign for America's Future to start posting here.<p>It's bad enough that Conservative political groups are hijacking a startup news aggregator. It's worse that the ideas they're pushing don't work.<p>Conservatism--the political philosophy promoted by AEI, Hoover, Heritage et al--is the flip side of Communism. With Communism, the purpose of people is to serve The State. In Conservatism, the purpose of people is to serve The Market. Thus, popular New Deal programs such as Social Security are anathema to them.<p>Both Communism and Conservatism work badly, producing similar effects.  Our unregulated Conservative markets have crashed and burned just as badly as the Russians' hyper-regulated Communist markets did.  States and countries run on Conservative principles are typically backward and stagnant:<p>--Mississippi and Alabama have Conservative state governments, and have practically no startup activity. Massachusetts and New York are not Conservative, which makes them capable of spawning MIT and Silicon Alley.<p>--Conservatives say that the keys to a strong economy is low taxes on rich people and unregulated markets. We've had them for the past decade, just as we did in the 1920s, and just as it did in the 1920s, our economy has melted down. What happened when we had sky-high taxes on rich people, and highly regulated markets? We got the U.S. economic boom of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, and built the world's biggest middle class.<p>The fact that their political philosophy has produced poor results doesn't give the folks at AEI/Hoover/Heritage pause, however. Just like the old Communists, these Conservatives are now complaining that ""Conservatism DOES work! It's just never been tried!"" Just as with Communism, Conservatism never fails, it is only failed.<p>As for the ideas of Milton Friedman that these Hacker News Hijackers are pushing, we may want to read what a Nobel Prize-winning economist has to say about them:<p><a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19857"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19857</a>",1231158526

Here are some ideas.<p>Most laptop have a special slot that accepts a cable lock.  I make use of it whenever I'm in a coffee shop and have to leave the machine for more than a moment.  I loop it through bag straps and my jacket too.  You want to look hard to deal with.<p>Its also a good idea to make sure your laptop requires a password after closing the lid or whatever it is that you do when you walk away from your machine.  And say hello to people around you and be helpful.  They'll more likely to watch your back.<p>And as always, make sure no one can see what your keying in.  To that end, it may help to use characters that are close together.<p>And yes, I know I'm a bit paranoid :-)",1284289170

He is under no legal obligation to answer their questions.  If I were to try something similar, I'd be much more polite about it, but, rude or not, he was perfectly within his rights to refuse to answer.<p>Now, if other factors were enough to actually raise reasonable suspicion that he had done something wrong (such as smuggling some contraband into the country), then the proper response is to move him on to further screening.<p><i>It's unreasonable to treat them as goons for simply doing their job.</i><p>Ah, yes, the tried-and-true ""just doing their job"" argument.  I don't buy it.  People are responsible for their conduct while performing their job.  Their employer may set policy, but in the end the person implementing that policy that must accept shared responsibility for that policy.<p><i>They're real people, most of them probably decent ones (because really, most people are decent people)</i><p>Wait, wait, wait.  Now, I'm going on just the words of the author here, but:<p>""The officer changed tack to bad cop. 'Let this guy sit until he cools down,' the officer loudly said to a colleague. 'It could be two, three, four hours. He’s gonna sit there until he cools down.'""<p>How does that describe the actions of a decent person?  I don't care if the author was rude to the customs official.  Declaring in a power-trip manner that you're going to make someone wait for 2-4 hours just because you can... how is that decent?<p>I <i>do</i> think the guy was a bit of a douche in how he handled the situation: ""none of your business"" is probably one of the rudest ways he could refuse to answer.  Something more like, ""I'm sorry, but I'm not legally required to answer your questions and would prefer not to,"" seems like it would have garnered a better response, both from the customs officials, and from the hordes of commenters calling him a douche.  If he had done that, and <i>still</i> was subjected to the same mistreatment, I'd feel a lot more sympathetic.  But still, he did nothing legally wrong, and exercised his rights as a US citizen, and was detained and hassled for it.  <i>That's</i> wrong.",1284288992

I don't recall if I CLEPed anything after that, though I did take some additional first year classes....let me see if I can reconstruct the timeline for you:<p>Took 2 years of college starting at age 18 at the local hometown college.  Had no major the first year.  Chose a history major the second year so I wouldn't have to change advisors and could largely continue taking whatever interested me.  Dropped out because I got married and began following my husband's military career from place to place.<p>Spent many years checking out every available educational option at every duty station while having babies and doing the military wife thing.  Much to my frustration, they never met my needs (will skip the details to try to keep this short).<p>Showed up in California, where in-state tuition (that I qualified for) at a community college was about $13/credit hour (and later dropped to $11).  Talked to a college counselor.  Enrolled in two classes and tested out of three others and was given credit for my 2 years of college from when I was a teen to wrap up an Associate of Arts in Humanities in May 1999.<p>That fall, much to my astonishment, enrolled in a bachelor's degree (I was astonished because I was trying to lock in those old credits for ""some day, when I might return to school"", which I had not envisioned to mean ""like maybe this fall!"").  The program:  Bachelor of Science in Environmental Resource Management.  Environmental studies degrees are typically rooted in geology departments at colleges and tend to be very science-heavy.  Since I had a humanities degree, I was missing some of the lower level sciences I needed.  I don't recall if I CLEPed any of those.  I do know I took at least one such class at a different California community college.  This was amidst a huge health crisis, so some of the details of that time in my life are a bit fuzzy.<p>Later got my Certificate in GIS, the equivalent of master's level work.  But I still have not finished my bachelor's, due in part to a divorce and said health issues.  I also now have a certificate my employer paid for, which is industry-specific.  Employement-wise, no one cares that I have done the equivalent of master's level work.  I don't have my bachelor's degree, so it's a big ""So what?""  My plans:  make it on my own, where actual ability to Bring It matters more than a sheepskin.<p>Hope that makes more sense.",1284288167

In some situations, this has certain advantages e.g. when upgrading your hard disk. It also provides a way to allow access only to certain parts by distributing your documents over several containers. I use truecrypt on my netbook and haven't had any problems with it in years and found it a convenient way to securely share files between computers with different OSes. Truecrypt is also available for linux but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an ARM/android version available. On linux, I use encryptfs though.",1284288085

If you're using the passphrase-wrapped-by-login-password method (convenient, I think Ubuntu implements this method) then security is not that great - because it's ultimately limited by the strength of your login password: if an attacker gets his hands on the wrapped passphrase, such as is the case when your laptop gets nicked, brute-force methods will suffice.<p>As for /tmp and swap: those are not required to be persistent over reboots.

Winner of the Most OCD-ly amazing slide Deck Animations Award – they really were lovely.<p>• Kerning, Orgasms & Those Goddamned Japanese Toothpicks: Nerds care about things that other people don’t. That’s fine, don’t expect them to, try and make stuff so they don’t. Never get complacent, useful feedback probably hurts. Put the “narcism of minor differences” aside to deliver",1284286379

If you have the data on the notebook that are worth a lot of money and you can imagine that somebody would be interested at that then you should encrypt the OS partition.\nEver heard about page file? It's on the OS partition, unencrypted. Temporary files? There, unencrypted. Even if the temporary files are deleted, the content of them remains on the hard disk. Unencrypted.",1284286084

But at their current rate of progress, they'll be playing second or third fiddle to Google in the mobile space inside a few years. It's inevitable.<p>I'm not sure whether the second sentence is supposed to actually contradict the first here, or if it's just a separate, orthogonal assertion (perhaps about technical quality or features)—but if Atwood is really trying to imply that you can iterate toward ""tastefulness"", that's simply ignorant.<p>There is a reason that the term ""design"" exists as a separate and unique idea from ""implementation."" By looking at your entire problem space top-down, you can see the ""shape"" of the space, and so head straight toward the <i>global</i> minima. Plopping down in one place and running really fast will just get you to the top of the nearest hill, not the tallest mountain. Google is great at hill-climbing, but I've never seen them start on a hill, realize they were stuck, climb down, and find a mountain. (Instead, Google's successful projects either <i>start</i> at the base of the tallest mountain—Pagerank, Gmail, Chrome, etc.—or are acquired from someone else who has already done the design stage for them—Maps, Groups, etc. It doesn't seem like Android is in either of these categories.)",1284285818

If you don't encrypt C: disk every forensic worker will trivially recover a lot of material that you'd believe was encrypted on another partition.<p>If we're talking about Linux where you configured /boot unencrypted and everything else encrypted, only then it's about the attack scenario that parent mentions.",1284285653

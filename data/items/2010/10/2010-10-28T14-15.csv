1843099,comment,1842384,1842550,0,0,spokey,,,"For the record, I know what ""hubris"" means, it's the candidates that don't. This may say something sad about the level of liberal arts education among developers.<p>Now that I think about it, this also may say something about the candidates ability to think on their feet and/or the degree to which their curiosity exceeds their reluctance to appear ignorant, since the way the question is structured it is fairly obvious you don't need know what hubris means to answer the question. You can just pick another ""virtue"".  I'm pretty sure that's what I'd do in that scenario, but maybe I'm less candid than others in interviews.<p>A couple of interesting things about that first question:<p>* My friend who introduced me to this question said he once had a candidate pick ""impatience"" and then proceeded to tell the story of how and why he threw a chair through a glass window during a meeting. That guy did not get the job. There probably would have been other red flags with that candidate, but it is interesting to note how few questions would likely lead to the candidate volunteering that anecdote.  Throwing a chair through a window in a business setting is very bad. Not having the sense to keep that story to yourself during a job interview is the icing on the cake.<p>* I'm surprised how often candidates will miss or choose to ignore the ""pick <i>one</i>"" aspect of the question and proceed to give one example for each.  This doesn't necessarily strike me a positive or negative (actually, maybe a little positive), but it happens probably 60% of the time.<p>* For the some candidates this can be a good ""employer branding"" question in the sense that it suggests the hiring manager is at least a little bit clueful and appreciative of ""hacker"" culture.  (And vice versa. Most answers to this question are acceptable, but language/culture issues aside I'm always a little troubled by candidates that don't understand how one could possibly consider those virtues. More to the point I don't see how a good developer could not recognize the importance of a little bit of laziness, impatience or hubris to their craft.)<p>Regrading the latter two questions:<p>Clearly the intent of the questions are to get a sense of what motivates the potential employee (both positively and negatively).<p>I didn't know it when I first started using them, but it turns out these questions are most valuable after the candidate has been hired, as they provides significant insight into how to manage and motivate the employee.  It's nearly essential to understand how to motivate an employee, and this turns out to be an easy way to get at that information. You could (and I have) ask this question after the candidate is hired, but in my experience people are candid about different things before and after being hired, sometimes it's useful to plan for that.<p>I've come to realize that there isn't really a bad answer to this question. (Well, maybe if the candidate couldn't come up with <i>any</i> reward or cause for leaving, but that's never happened.)<p>Answers I frequently hear for the first question include ""give me more money"", ""give me a promotion"", ""give me more time off"" or ""give me more freedom/flexibility/autonomy"".  There's nothing really negative about any of these answers, in fact I think each of them are pretty respectable, but more importantly they say something about what the candidate values.<p>At some cash-strapped places I've worked the ""more money"" answer was a little problematic, not for anything it says about the candidate as much as it suggests they won't be happy in the environment that we could provide them. At one firm I worked at ""work/life balance"" was non-existent, so ""give me time off"" suggested a poor culture fit.<p>For most environments I've worked in a good answer to the first question is something like ""Once I've proven my competence I'd appreciate the opportunity to take on new or broader responsibilities, or to work on more interesting, more important or higher visibility projects.""  A good answer to the second question is something like ""If I wasn't learning anything new"". (An very valuable answer to the second question is something like ""if my job became X"" or ""if I no longer had the opportunity to do Y"".)<p>Generally I'd prefer to work with people that are motivated by doing new and interesting things well, people who are willing to take on new challenges. I guess this answer also demonstrates a bit of ambition, which is a good thing in moderation. It also may show a degree of political savvy, in the sense that ""pay me more"", while honest, is probably not something most potential employers want to hear (at least for many job categories; on Wall Street or for a sales job I guess that might be just the answer you're looking for, but those folks are usually compensated on a commission basis to begin with).",1288277755

I've gathered a team of designers (five of them, currently) who design the logos for me on a commission basis, allowing me to scale my expenses as I make sales. The web platform I have set up allows clients to communicate with designers directly through the design process.<p>As this is the first version of my site, I am offering only a one-size-fits-all service to clients right now. As I work on marketing v1.0, however, I am also developing v2.0, a logo design <i>marketplace</i>.<p>One of the many good questions that has been raised in these comments is how to compete with established design marketplaces. Here are some of the ways I have considered.<p>- Offer equivalent services with a lower fee.
- Add additional services, such as an hour of brand consulting before the logo is designed, or assistance in placing the logo on the client website/etc.
- Providing a more complete branding package with letterhead, stationery, and website design.<p>In what other ways could I compete? Perhaps the most fundamental question is whether this market is so crowded and has such established/successful companies in it already that I should not attempt to direct in the logo market completely. In that case, what other niches have you seen that are similar but less crowded? I am not opposed to pivoting.<p>An open question is how I will be able to maintain customer satisfaction and also keep logo quality at a high level, while scaling my services.",1288276721

My visual acuity is low (around 20/180) and my field of vision very narrow (less than 20deg). Still, it doesn't really stop me from doing much. I program-and I also design.<p>A couple of years ago I developed narrow-angle glaucoma, in addition to my other problems. After several laser surgeries failed to resolve the problem, I had a more invasive surgical procedure done. Afterwards, I was completely blind for 48hrs. Aside from the fact that it was terrifying, because at that point we didn't know how much of my vision would come back, I found that I was able to adjust fairly quickly. In just a few hours, I was able to get around the house, get dressed, shower, brush teeth, etc. unassisted. Eating was a little more difficult. It's hard to fork food you can't see. I stuck to sandwiches. I didn't attempt reading (I don't know Braille) or using the computer.<p>I'm sure this was made easier by the fact that I'm very familiar with my house and by the fact that my vision was already poor, so I'm more used to doing more things by feel/sound/memory, especially at night.<p>Which, I guess, answers your question, but to finish off the story:<p>After a couple of days, my vision started to slowly come back, though it was very blurry for a long time. I was able to start using the computer, via a combination of the screen reader, enlarging, and inverting the colors on the display. All I could see at that point were shapes, and, after about a week, in order to read text, it had to be about 128pt and high contrast.<p>Fortunately, most of my vision returned. The first couple of months were slow going, but after that, it got to the point where I could pretty much function as I did before. It took around 6 months to recover completely, though. I did end up losing some contrast sensitivity and as a result, I can no longer read printed text. There's just not enough contrast. I mean, I can see the words, reading for more than just a few minutes gives me a headache. So now I read books on an iPad and with the backlit screen (a backlit display helps a ton) and zoom capabilities, I can read without headaches.",1288275999

Figuring out what you don't like is important, so don't disregard its significance.<p>You also have some obvious good signs which are worth encouraging:
1. You are fighting and trying to figure out your moves. A lot of life is iterative, so keep on trying, its a habit that will hold you in good stead.
2. You exercise - great habit right there. 
3. You seem to have had a decent look at the situation which is a good start at figuring things out.<p>Try volunteering and helping out with an NGO. Helps give you drive and sounds like something that will help fill up that purpose void. 
- You may not get purpose from your education/work, but that doesn't mean you HAVE to get it from there. Do other things you enjoy, it helps in getting through stuff.<p>From my personal experience, some of the things that helped me out were:<p>1. Diet - Sugar and carbs help a lot; feeling low led to missing meals which led to feeling low. Having a pick me up treat or something sweet often completely changed my day. Its come to the point that feeling really low often means that I have been pushing myself too hard and have neglected myself - big no no.
 (Do note - I am NOT recommending binging, bringing me to pt 3)<p>1. Not taking myself too seriously when I was low and thinking about stuff. 
When you are feeling low, do note that you are NOT an unbiased observer. Take your worst case scenarios with a grain of salt.<p>3. Learning how your body operates - This was big for me. It took me a long while to learn how to respond to my needs them and take care of them. But once I did, it helped me understand myself and the situations which I need to create to be effective.<p>Pt 2 was important because it helped reduce the build up of self doubt, which then lets me focus on building myself up and getting on with figuring out what would make me happy next.<p>This stuff isn't going to solve your problems, but it should be useful in moving towards solving it.

I'm only now thinking of adding more tools to my testing toolchain after I have a better understanding of the actual  problems I run into often.<p>About testing web APIs.

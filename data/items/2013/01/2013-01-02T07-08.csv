4995743,comment,4994367,4994774,5,0,chatmasta,,,"This comment highlights the benefits of editors in the traditional publishing industry. The publishing process may seem full of painful disincentives, but there are many non-obvious benefits to following its subscribed protocol. One of them is that you do not publish books, especially instructional ones, containing glaring errors.<p>There was an article on HN recently that mentioned the fact that most of a book's marketing is its reputation. This makes sense because you can't form a full opinion of a book until after you've read it, so buyers of the book are heavily influenced by the opinions of others who have already finished it. Nobody is going to shell out money for a book that they hear contains even a FEW glaring errors.<p>People hold books to such high standards because once you put your words into print, you cannot change them. There is no real-time editing of books. So people assume you have put the proper amount of preparation, thought, and diligence into your writing and editing. This is very difficult to do by yourself.<p>That said.... I do want to emphasize that the ""traditional publishing industry"" generally refers to the producers of hard-copy books. With the industry moving toward a digital future, real-time editing is becoming possible. I think we will see a move toward ""crowdsourced"" editing of for-profit books, not so much in the way that Wikipedia edits its content but more in the way that video games fix their bugs. We may start to see ""beta releases"" of digital books for early adopters. At the cost of reading what amounts to a rough draft, you will be able to access the content early, so long as you report any errors you find. I think on the whole this is a very positive change that will increase the world's general knowledge.<p>So I'm a very big fan of your first attempt at creating this book. I think the errors pflats points out are important to consider, but certainly nothing to discourage you. Don't let this criticism stop you from your pursuit. You are on a very good track.",1357113325

Modern OSes take up far more RAM (because more services are kept available) but when you're performing operation solely in user space on a modern system, the OS doesn't really interfere. The only impact on any multitasked system -- process scheduling -- is carefully written to have an undetectably small overhead when there's only one busy process.<p>The reason why computers can still occasionally feel slow is:<p>1) They are processing millions (sometimes billions) of times more data than 1980's era computer.<p>2) You can always fill up the resources on your computer or overwork your hard disk.

4995711,comment,4993232,4995630,3,0,haberman,,,"It is true that this approach requires a separate code generator for every architecture.  That is not the same as saying that ""retargeting will be hard"" (which makes it sound like DynASM somehow gets in your way).<p>Yes, as I said before, if you have a problem that maps cleanly onto LLVM and you don't mind the weight that LLVM brings along, by all means use it!  But you shouldn't think of LLVM as an ""assembly generator library.""  That implies that it is far more general-purpose than it actually is.  DynASM is <i>actually</i> an assembly generator library.  LLVM is an IR, a set of optimization passes for that IR, and a set of target-specific code generators for that IR.  The key point is ""for that IR.""<p>DynASM is a tool that you can count on when no existing IR's like LLVM, .NET, etc. fit your needs.  It's a lower-level tool -- LLVM could conceivably use DynASM to perform its own target-specific instruction encoding.  DynASM is a small, focused tool that does one thing and does it well.  LLVM is more of a toolbox that tries to get the 99% case right for its target audience.  As a result, it represents a lot more compromises and changes in more fundamental ways over time (for example, it recently completely rewrote its register allocator).<p>> Perhaps the preprocessor is syntactic sugar over a library that build the code representation as a data structure and there are ways to programmatically manipulate this data structure to implement optimizations.<p>No, definitely not.  The idea is that you perform optimizations <i>before</i> the code generation step.  I didn't do this in the article because these were just simple ""Hello, World"" examples, but maybe I should write a follow-up article that illustrates how optimization fits into this framework.",1357112050

1964811,comment,1956497,1961367,0,0,binaryfinery,,,"In which case there is no such thing as passing by reference. Ever. In C++ when you ""pass by reference"", what actually happens is that the address of the thing is taken, and a pointer is generated, and then that pointer is passed by value. Do you see? Any argument you put forth to the contrary will involve language specific features and conventions of C++. Your will have to claim that because the C++ compiler does this for you, that makes it special. In Java there are primitives and objects. Primitives are only passed by value. Objects are passed by reference. If you pass an object as a parameter, and then modify a property of the parameter, then it is the original object that is modified. This, in fact, is the same as when you pass an Object in C++ by reference. In contrast, in C++ you can also pass an object by value: the entire object is copied onto the stack.<p>class Foo; void modify( Foo& x) { x.setBar(1);} ; <- pass by reference in C++.<p>class Foo; void modify( Foo x) { x.setBar(1);} ; <- pass by reference in Java.<p>Java spares you the & because Java <i>only</i> passes by reference.<p>Again, to argue the contrary, simply because it passes an object pointer by value, automatically, is to argue that C++ never passes by reference because it too takes the address automatically.<p>The fact is that Java passes by reference exactly as C++ does. However, even if this were not the case, it would also be completely acceptable for Java to refer to what it does as pass by reference simply because it chooses too. These things <i>are</i> object references. If I pass a java object reference, is it acceptable to say I'm passing by reference? If Java people want to say it is, then it is. Will the world end, for example, because the word ""heap"" means two different things in computer science? <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap</a> OMG! Who is <i>right</i>?<p>My point is basically summed up here: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/435/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/435/</a><p>You are where the physicist is standing. You insist that Java biologists are using your terms wrong while oblivious to the mathematician. You have your abstractions. Java has theirs.<p>Of course, maybe you're the chemist, and I'm the physicist (I still write assembly) and the hardware guys are the mathematicians. Whatever.<p>As for the insulting tone, yes its a character flaw. When someone makes a statement like ""I'm really tired of hearing folks (incorrectly) state [whatever]"", its insulting. Its especially insulting when its wrong. In an ideal world I'd be able to respond without resorting to responding in kind, but I'm flawed. Sorry. You're still wrong.",1291352164

I've looked at a few hundred resumes and proposals in my life for hires and outsourcers, but I haven't submitted one since I did an internship when I was 18 (did I even submit one there? not sure). I'm trying to think back to my own experiences choosing people, but back then I interviewed everyone with half-decent credentials because I didn't trust my resume-reading skills, and figured it couldn't hurt. Then I hired people who I jived with personally who seemed to have the skills and motivation. For outsourcers, it was all about portfolio and speed of their replies to my further questions, always. (This is a fascinating insight to me writing this, actually, I never realized that before - speed and portfolio were really the only two determining factors... written language less important, I contracted some people in India with spelling/grammar errors who obviously had the technical chops and speed one time, and then did a lot of work with them)<p>Okay, good discussion here Jon.

Twenty percent of all gains.  Apply this incentive structure to any sufficiently large pot of money and you make out like a bandit.  Investors, not so much.  Thankfully, if you have enough money to invest in a hedge fund you have enough money to pay someone who knows this to explain it to you.<p>Actively managed mutual funds charge a management fee, typically in the neighborhood of 1.5 ~ 2% a year.  (These are, thankfully, coming down.)  This compares to 0.2% a year for index funds.  Since actively managed mutual funds do not add value -- another secret in plain sight -- this will, over time, result in approximately half of the investors' gains accruing to the money manager.  Most investors just pick whatever their broker recommends (brokers <i>shudder</i>) or pick the default choice for their retirement plan, which is generally set via splitting that huge fee with whomever is tasked to do the recommendation.<p>Buy cheap index funds (or, if that strikes you as complicated, open an account with Vanguard and get one of their targeted retirement date options -- they'll work out the math for you).",1291351769

1964726,comment,1963945,1964367,0,0,binaryfinery,,,"Assembly and C are low level languages. Javascript is high level language. The claim appears to be based on the fact that it is the lowest level available in the browser as if this somehow makes it comparable to assembly language, the lowest language available on computers. It is a straw man argument. Saying that they server ""equivalent"" purposes is bollocks. Using your flawed logic, one could say that because javascript is also the <i>highest</i> level language supported natively by all browsers that it therefor serves the same purpose as HAL in 2001.<p>The fact that various companies have sprung up that can take a language and generate javascript from it doesn't make javascript comparable to assembly.<p>Normally one takes a high level language and compiles it to a lower level language. However, it is not the case that simply compiling one language into another automatically dictates that one is higher than the other. In this case, it is done because javascript is the only language available, and some people don't want to learn it. I suspect that most people are put off learning javascript because the first time they tried it it was a PITA. Especially, it didnt do the same thing in IE as it did in Chrome. So people wrote frameworks like GWT and NOLOH so they could use languages that were familiar to them. I understand why: its easier to solve one unknown at a time. Presented with two problems: a) I don't know javascript and b) browsers are shitty, people decided to tackle problem (b) and ignore problem (a) by writing libraries in their familiar language. Ironically they probably now know more about javascript than anyone else.<p>I'm opting to deal with problem (a) and solve problem (b) by using jQuery. YMMV.<p>As for the advantages of something like NOLOH, yes, sure there are many advantages to using what is essentially big enough to be called middleware. However I suggest that the advantages initially presented by its ease of use will be quickly outweighed by all the things it can't do, or that it demands you do ""its way"". Perhaps NOLOH is the worlds first middleware that doesnt have this problem, or perhaps its the 2010 version of MFC. The problem is, by the time you find out its the latter, its too late. The risk of that discovery is greater than the learning curve of javascript and modern frameworks. Unlike assembly language.",1291350028

1. ""WikiLeaks doesn’t own or otherwise control all the rights to [the] classified content the material""
2. Use of Wikileaks content could ""cause injury to [some] person or entity""<p>The claims have some merit and Amazon has the right to discontinue service on the basis of ToS violations. But they seem to be applying, in the first instance, the same criterion to this case as they would to ordinary cases of copyright infringements, which seems ethically weak and a little outlandish. And while the second claim is at least superficially more compelling, the standard seems unusually broad. Isn't it the case, if only trivially, that Amazon already hosts and sells a lot of content that could conceivably be used by someone, somewhere to cause injury to some person or entity? In general, is the content provider absolutely responsible for the uses to which its content is put, and does Amazon really want to be in the business of policing that? The argument, presumably, is that Wikileaks' documents constitute an egregious and specific possible cause of injury, although Amazon still seems to be blurring the distinction between ""causing"" and ""making possible"" or ""enabling"", and discounting the possible good that the release of classified documents can do. I think it's also worth pointing out that Wikileaks has adopted a fairly heavy hand with regard to redactions in the past months, and asked Amnesty and the Pentagon (apparently in vain) to help in that process. Some minimal context for Wikileaks' actions and the Amazon message, not all of which throws the best possible light on Wikileaks:<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/08/20/wikileaks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/08/20...</a><p><a href=""http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-22/us/wikileaks.editing_1_wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-redacted-documents?_s=PM:US"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-22/us/wikileaks.editing_1_wi...</a><p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/10/afghanistan-war-logs-wikileaks-human-rights-groups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/10/afghanistan-war-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/29/AR2010112905743.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11...</a>",1291349194

Reading the transcript of the deposition of Jack Valenti -- may everyone dance on his grave -- was hilarious, and a depressing peek into litigation.  The radio show was pretty good, but each time I revisit it (once a year or so), it seems to have devolved further into pointless wanking.",1291349141

Calculus is fair game on their admissions exam, even!  On the other hand, there's never an expectation that physicists know medicine.",1291349125

Just sit down with some outsiders and give them some tasks to perform on your UI.  Even for experienced and talented UI designers, this is invaluable because it cuts right through all the learned knowledge you have of the interface, which is impossible to do for anyone who was involved in creating it.<p>Of course this advice doesn't apply to power user UIs, but those are easy because your users will constantly email you with improvements.",1291349113

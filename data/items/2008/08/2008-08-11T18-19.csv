Now that they're seeing volume as a premium general purpose phone they'll need to track the desirable features in that segment. The BB Bold looks like a great start (the UI is sooo much nicer looking than 4.1-4.3), but Apple has really raised the bar, so it's not a gimmie like it was in years past.",1218480737

In the 19th and early 20th century there was a lot of people scared that coal was going to run out and torpedo the early industrial economy. Quite a few prominent intellectuals were worried about Peak Coal. It didn't happen. It COULD theoretically happen, granted. But technology grew to use different inputs and the price system gave people incentive to explore new deposits. We still have tons of coal.",1218480698

BB doesn't force themselves into the center of your transactions, which means as a developer you're free to do things like charge per month or per message, or distribute your app for free and allow people to buy it inside the application itself.",1218480365

or
You believe that luck is random, in which case it can be eliminated from your thinking and you can focus on all the stuff you can control.""<p>Life is full of stochastic processes which all have a bit of randomness to them. Luck actually does not exist. There is just random chance that some event may happen which a certain subjective point of view interprets as favorable.<p>Take poker as a simple example. There is random ""luck"" in that at each point in the game, certain sequences of cards could fall that are more or less favorable to the cards in your hand. You win money at poker by considering how likely each random outcome is and making rational decisions based on this.<p>I think the likelihood of each random or apparently random is just another factor in the decision making process. Just like in poker, it's a volume game - make good bets on likely outcomes and if you get screwed a few times it'll all even out if you play enough. Repetition is how we can get randomness under control.",1218479114

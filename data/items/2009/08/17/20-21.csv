However, phones equipped with Maemo 5 are definitely coming to the high end of Nokia's range. (Symbian's strength is that it works with substantially cheaper hardware than any of the competing smartphone OSs, which is great for Nokia, as they are particularly strong globally at the lower end of the market and in emerging markets.)<p>The important point is that Nokia is adopting the Qt toolkit across the range. Both Symbian and Maemo will have Qt at the top of the stack by 2011.

769036,comment,768057,768914,0,0,dkersten,,,"I never meant to imply OOP when I said message passing. I guess it was the wrong term to use, because its got too much of an OOP ring to it. What I mean is that events or packets of data or what have you are passed between independent agents. The communication is loosely coupled fropm the agents and the agents all function independently (they often work together, but the ""function"" independently).<p>If I say ""Hello, Bob"", this ""message"" or communicatable data is passed from me to Bob. But coupling is also low - Mary and Peter, who are standing nearby, can also hear this - unless I whisper.<p>Basically, the events or messages or data packets or whatever you want to call them are simply sent OUT for whatever to pick them up and do with them what they will. The messages can be directed though (say to Bob vs simply yell) and the listeners can be restricted (whisper). In this respect, I see the world as independent threads of execution which communicate through some (anonymous, if I hear someone yell ""Fire"", I don't care who) message dispatch system. Something like this: <a href=""http://didntread.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/components.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://didntread.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/components.png</a><p>People are made up of sub-agents, which themselves are made up of smaller, independent agents and so on. Cells communicate with nearby cells through proteins and chemical reactions and electrical signals - these are messages being passed (anonymously) between agents.<p>Now, if each agent was a single thread of execution, then you have discrete points where communication and interaction occurs. You said that this is not how the world works, and you are right. Imagine instead a network of connected operations, where when one operation produces some result, it passes it to all the connected operations. When an operation has received all its inputs, it can execute - concurrently, in parallel with any other operations which also have their dependencies met. At some point, these operations too will complete their processing and their output is propogated to connected operations. In such a system, when a message is received or when an interaction occurs, the network of operations (the agent) can process it immediately. No longer does the agent have to wait for a certain discrete point in a sequential processing system to communicate or interact - it can do so as soon as some data is available. These entworks do contain state, just like you said the agents in the real world do, but instead of having some fixed memory buffer contain the state (well, technically, you could have that too..), the state is maintained in feedback loops between operations (think of a flip-flop in electronics: the output of a logic gate is fed back as its input, either directly or indirectly through other logic gates).<p>What I have just described is a dataflow system and THAT is how I think the world works, if it were a programming system.<p>Note that some things ARE inherently sequential - the operations are still ordered by their dependencies. Maybe the operations themselves process their data in a number of sequential steps. This is fine, because certain things require ordering to make sense or to work well.",1250541390

I don't have to worry whether it will oscillate at a certain higher frequency and induce a signal in the value of some other variable. I don't have to worry about how much current that 'If' statement will draw and whether it can dissipate the heat there inside that while statement. Whether there will be a voltage drop across the while statement that will make the 'If' statement not function. I don't have to worry that if i run this program in a salt water environment that the salt water may get in between the 'If' statement and the 'While' statement and cause corrosion. I don't have to worry when I refer to the value of a variable whether I am exceeding the fan-out limit by referring to it 20 times. I don't have to worry, when I refer to the variable, how much capacitance it has and whether there has been sufficient time to charge up the value. I don't have to worry when I write the program, about how I am going to physically assemble each copy and whether I can manage to get access to put that 'If' statement inside the 'While' statement. I don't have to worry about how I am going to gain access in case that 'If' statement breaks, to remove it and replace it with a new one. So many problems that we don't have to worry about in software. That makes it fundamentally easier. It is fundamentally easier to write a program than to design a physical object that's going to work. This may seem strange because you have probably heard people talking about how hard software is to design and how this is a big problem and how we are going to solve it. They are not really talking about the same question as I am. I am comparing physical and software systems of the same complexity, the same number of parts. I am saying the software system is much easier to design than the physical system. But the intelligence of people in these various fields is the same, so what do we do when we are confronted with an easy field? We just push it further! We push our abilities to the limit. If systems of the same size are easy, let's make systems which are ten times as big, then it will be hard! That's what we do! We make software systems which are far bigger in terms of number of parts than physical systems. A physical system whose design has a million different pieces in it is a mega project. A computer program whose design has a million pieces in it, is maybe 300,000 lines, a few people will write that in a couple of years.""</i><p>""The Danger of Software Patents"" by Richard M.

But I do take offence that 301works is a bit.ly publicity stunt.<p>See, I care most about the Cligs users. To me, 301works is a backup in case something bad happens to Cligs. The backup is operated by an independent (read not bit.ly) service, namely Gnip. I and others insisted on having an independent entity run it for obvious reasons.<p>Each URL shortener specifies the terms of transfering the data to Gnip. It can be anything from what I call ""the dead man's will"" option of simply locking away the data to be released on the termination of service, all the way to having a completely open data policy that the URL shortener basically says to the world ""do as you please"".<p>So, at the absolute worst, it's an offsite backup service. In reality, it's much more useful than a mere backup service. For example, if we get the details right, the Gnip API could power a URL-expanding service that takes some load off the URL shorteners' servers; this is just a basic example.<p>I've been talking about such a service with other owners of URL shorteners for a few months, and so there is nothing new about it. We just worked hard now given the anxiety we were seeing from our users. A lot of people worked hard to make it work in a good way, sometimes working at odd hours, to make sure that no one gets the short end of the stick.<p>So please, don't call 301works a bit.ly publicity stunt. It's not.<p>If anyone wants to talk about this more, email me: my first name (first 6 letters of my HN username) at cli.gs.",1250539290

Visual voicemail, some untold but presumably high % of monthly contract fees (allowing them to plow tens of millions into ads, creating the virtuous cycle of users and app developer growth), an unprecedented degree of freedom over app distribution, commitments to building out the cell network, etc. Building the hardware and software themselves gives them better quality control over the end product, having tremendous upper hand in an exclusive deal with a national carrier performs a similar function.<p>I'm guessing that had they given in to whatever the hell Verizon requested, and has no reason to discontinue requesting, you'd be looking at a much different phone.

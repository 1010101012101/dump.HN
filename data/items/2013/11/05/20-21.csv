6678245,comment,6676929,6677870,0,0,sillysaurus2,,,"<i>that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no value in options like this</i><p>Actually, your proposal has negative value, because the danger is you might actually go on to implement the broken design and trick people (along with yourself) into believing it&#x27;s trustworthy.<p><i>a roll-your-own version would shift that trust burden from a US company to you or whoever sets up your server.</i><p>You&#x27;ve shifted the burden, but <i>away</i> from commercial pressure is almost always a bad idea. Now instead of having a team of people thinking about security issues 24/7 and paying strict attention to their server configurations and minimizing their attack surface, you have only yourself.  You may be capable, but most people aren&#x27;t.  And even the very best of us make mistakes.<p>Once your server is breached, the security offered by this design drops to nil.  Compromising the server compromises the security.  That&#x27;s a fatal flaw.  It&#x27;s no accident that all modern cryptosystems are based around the idea of &quot;Here&#x27;s your secret key.  Don&#x27;t let it get stolen.&quot;  It&#x27;s the strongest guarantee we have.  It&#x27;s incredible that it&#x27;s even possible to get such a strong security guarantee: &quot;As long as you don&#x27;t let your private key get stolen or get MITM&#x27;d, it&#x27;s impossible for anyone to eavesdrop on you.&quot;  That&#x27;s incredible!  Governments for thousands of years have been wishing for such a thing, and now our generation finally has it, because we <i>live in the future</i>... and you&#x27;re going out of your way to give it up.<p>Your design is literally &quot;transmit your secret key to the server while hoping it&#x27;s still under control of friendlies.&quot;  This kind of thinking is dangerous precisely because it tries to frame blind faith / hope / &quot;probably won&#x27;t happen to me&quot; as a security pillar.  But it&#x27;s not a pillar.  You can&#x27;t trust hope.  Your trust is the very first thing any adversary will subvert.  In fact, if the cryptosystem is designed properly, adversaries won&#x27;t have any realistic route of attack short of physically compromising the boxes you&#x27;re receiving secret messages on.  By fooling yourself into believing in the myth of &quot;better than nothing&quot;, you&#x27;ve opened up an attack vector for the adversary.  If you were to use a proper cryptosystem, then the adversary wouldn&#x27;t be able to attack you.  And since you&#x27;re opening doors for the adversary, it would not be unfair to characterize that as &quot;you&#x27;re doing the adversary&#x27;s job for them.&quot;<p>I apologize for the negativity.  Usually when people pick apart an idea, they&#x27;re expected to present a better alternative.  In this case I don&#x27;t know what the better solution is, because it hasn&#x27;t been invented yet.  But you&#x27;re talking about a cryptosystem.  Cryptosystems fail silently, because adversaries break them without informing their victim.  So all it takes is one misstep to completely lose: the adversary will be able to intercept everything, and you&#x27;ll be none the wiser.  By transmuting the trust guarantee from &quot;don&#x27;t lose your secret key&quot; to &quot;trust this central server,&quot; it exposes dozens of attack vectors.  Every vector that leads to a server breach is now a vector that can subvert you.",1383685107

You have to encrypt for an individual, as with PGP, for there to be meaningful security, at which point your provider&#x27;s &quot;secure&quot; practices are only covering a bit of metadata, some of which will be leaked when communicating the message.<p>The problem with PGP is that it has a complicated trust model, poor client integration, and does not provide forward secrecy.  The first two may be fixable via better user interfaces (which includes breaking from traditional webmail) but forward secrecy would need protocol support is in conflict with the asynchrony email currently enjoys.",1383684977

6678211,comment,6676801,6676801,2,0,onelovelyname,,,"Decided to think about Helpouts from Google&#x27;s perspective. I don&#x27;t see it as a stand-alone monetizable business, put into the market to compete with LiveNinja. Rather, it&#x27;s a strategic move by Google to strengthen its ecosystem by:<p>1. Onboarding more people to G+. G+ is Google&#x27;s attempt to create a single social identity for each person across all Google products, thus uniting what can seem like a fragmented Google experience. Having Helpouts (using Google Hangouts) is one way to drive new users for G+ through a specific use case.<p>2. Developing real-time results for help in Google Search. Imagine what will happen when a user searches &quot;math tutoring today&quot; - Google can offer real-time suggestions from Helpouts using Universal Search and Knowledge Graph.<p>3. Driving new business accounts on Google Apps & Google Analytics, plus sell more ads. When Google encourages skilled people to create Helpouts, they are basically increasing the number of enterprise customers they can potentially recruit for Apps, Analytics, and oh yeah - search / display ads.<p>And a random idea:<p>4. Using recorded Hangouts and posting them into a new category on Youtube. Could increase the overall quality of instruction. Also Youtube could be a great way to source Helpout teachers.<p>If Google chooses to achieve scale - by integrating with search most likely - it will be difficult for LiveNinja to compete on a broad scale. As previous posts mention, a niche / targeted approach may work better for LN to secure loyal users and deter drop off to Helpouts.",1383684853

Listing remote jobs isn&#x27;t new (for example, Authentic Jobs has a clear call-to-action to filter them), but focusing on them is interesting.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned so far is that a remote job is not exactly what I thought it was.

Or even, work mostly from home but come to the office once per month.<p>It was probably naive from my part to believe I could get a remote job easily.

Although it&#x27;s listed as a single &quot;reason&quot;, it constitutes several factual assertions glommed together. I parse them as:<p>A) Couples who are &quot;by most measures children&quot; are having more kids.<p>B) The kids described in assertion A have very little chance of happiness<p>C) &quot;the upper classes&quot; &quot;blissfully ignore&quot; A and B.<p>So let&#x27;s start with assertion A. In 1970 the average age of a first-time mother was about 21; in 2008 it was about 25. As couples have been waiting longer to get married, they also have been (on average) waiting longer to have children.<p>Sure, you might say, but that&#x27;s just an average. Maybe there&#x27;s a wider <i>spread</i>. So what about, say, teen pregnancy?<p>Answer: teen pregnancy rates have been dramatically declining throughout the developed world, including the US.<p>Here&#x27;s a recent news article about that:<p><a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57411981-10391704/u.s-teen-pregnancy-rates-at-an-all-time-low-across-all-ethnicities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57411981-10391704/u.s...</a><p>Quote from that article: &quot;That&#x27;s a 44 percent drop from 1991 to 2010. There were less teenage mothers in 2010 than any year since 1946.&quot;<p>So it&#x27;s not true that <i>Couples who are &quot;by most measures children&quot; are having more kids</i>. They&#x27;re having fewer kids.<p>Assertion B is that these kids, of whom there are fewer than ever before, have &quot;little chance of happiness&quot;. That seems a little dubious too. I&#x27;d be willing to be convinced on that one if there were some evidence given, but I don&#x27;t see any. Based on set point theory, I think most people are born with a certain propensity to be happy (or not) almost regardless of circumstance.<p><a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/201304/how-reset-your-happiness-set-point"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/20130...</a><p>Assertion C is that the &quot;upper classes&quot; &quot;blissfully ignore&quot; this alleged problem. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t seem to exist, I can&#x27;t blame them for doing so, even though I have no evidence that they do so.<p>In summary, Reason #2 (of 5) also falls apart upon inspection.<p>Reasons #3 and #4 similarly fall apart - they don&#x27;t seem to be making testable claims that are true, much less obviously so.",1383684590

If the system discourages greed, doesn&#x27;t that increase the incentive for greedy people to corrupt the system?</i><p>Of course it does. In fact, if you want an even better line: if it&#x27;s a greed motivated system and we work against greed, we&#x27;re directly disincentivizing economic activity.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely a fine line to draw. History has examples of the economic noose of overregulation just as surely as it does the industrial dystopia of underregulation.<p>It&#x27;s a lot like medicinal drugs (medicine). The difference between a  poison and a cure is dosage. Too much or too little and you can hurt someone instead of helping them. Or the interaction of multiple different treatments create new and possibly terrible outcomes.<p>Regulation (greed control) to me is very similar. The difference between good regulation and bad regulation is very minor, it&#x27;s dosage. A good policy applied the wrong way is just as bad as a bad policy. Multiple policies of regulation may interact in new and crazy ways.<p>So to me the proper regulation of Capitalism is like trying to dose a new drug. It&#x27;s extremely difficult and nuanced to do well. And even if done well, as you pointed out, there is always the incentive to cheat, and always the fallout of the disincentivization our actions cause.",1383683687

On any screen size it now takes longer to go from one control to another. \nI used to be able to zoom down all the way to street view. Now I have to click on a spot and hope that the street view option comes on. \nI used to be able to right click and search nearby. Now when I search in an area and want to see a list of results and I can&#x27;t change the search area without going back and forth. \nIt&#x27;s one thing to change the aesthetics and move features around. But to completely remove features is really annoying.<p>Mobile client: \nMy use case is when I&#x27;m in motion. I want to see where I&#x27;m at currently. It always shows where you last were before it fetches a GPS signal. Sometimes, it even shows me moving in the opposite direction at my old location before it finally updates and animates to my location. This leads to confusion while I&#x27;m driving or walking. The animation is really annoying because sometimes I&#x27;m super far from my previous location and I have to wait for the app to animate to my position and on top of that zoom down to a default zoom level which should never be assumed because different zoom levels have different contexts and this assumes a default.<p>When I do searches for anything, it automatically zooms to the top hit. I always have to zoom out or even stop it while it&#x27;s mid-zoom. They&#x27;ve removed tons of features like layers, seeing things along the way during navigation (useful for gas stations along the way home), etc. For the mobile client, I can really go on forever.<p>There was nothing wrong w/ the old maps looks wise. Yes, the new maps &quot;looks&quot; nicer but it&#x27;s actually frustrating to use and I&#x27;m sad to see a lot of features go.",1383682793

We are extremely focused on this segment and our offering in terms of price and trainer quality, etc speaks for itself.<p>Here are some observations from my point of view.<p>1. I welcome Google entering this space. I am not nearly as worried as others are. The big challenge that this business really has is that we need to explain to people that you can do somethings over video that you used to do in person. Google has infinitely more marketing dollars than we do. If they can convince folks that this is something easy, we would love to ride their coattails (is that one word?) on that one.<p>2. For some verticals, Google will do well (my guess, technical help etc). Building a fitness focused marketplace is not the same as building a music learning marketplace. We can make our user experience far more fitness centric than everyone else. Ultimately our users value that. So do users of other vertical marketplaces for online tutoring, etc. When you are meeting a trainer, we can offer health tracking, health data analysis, fitness suggestions based on your prior workouts with us. This is not impossible for Google but they have to boil the ocean first and then make their bets.<p>3. Working in this space, it has also taught us that while Google will be better at some things (integrating with Hangouts,  Android etc), if they are going to move to WebRTC, there are many users who still prefer IE and Safari and are stuck on older versions. If they move to support those browsers, then it is at odds with their WebRTC focus. We can offer an independent solution that uses WebRTC when available and not in other environments to again give a better user experience.<p>4. Overall, we are cautiously optimistic that this is good for this space. It validates our work for the past year and we are hoping the market is big enough for a lot of niche segments.<p>Be Wello,\nAmol",1383682350

But, the way you calculated it seemed off.<p>If I were to apply with a dating site or any other common app idea, my first sentence would be something I have learned that is profound.

6677859,comment,6676369,6676369,1,0,205guy,,,"I think this offline-first approach is very interesting, and definitely something that is overlooked in UI and app design. The OP is correct about telco and wifi signals being far from total coverage. There are lots of &quot;holes&quot; and in some places, it&#x27;s more a metaphor of moving between islands that have connectivity.<p>There is also another case of artificial data &quot;scarcity&quot; and that is the case no-data plans. To save money, I have a low cost ($10 and up) minutes-only phone plan. With apps that work with the offline-first mentality, being offline could be almost invisible on a 1-hour commute between the wifi at home and the office (no, I&#x27;m not one of those people who needs to read and write tweets in real-time).<p>Sometimes it is also a hardware issue. The first time I tried to use my phone as a true GPS with MotionX (this was 4 years ago on an iPhone 3G), I discovered it&#x27;s not possible. The app does download maps and cache them so you can go hiking out of cell range, but the iPhone does not support GPS-only operation. Either I leave the radios on and it depletes its battery looking for a signal, or I put it in airplane mode and GPS is disabled. I don&#x27;t believe a GPS-only configuration is possible even today.<p>Another point is that offline-first does not only apply to smart-phone apps, although that is probably the biggest problem space. But there are a lot of people who commute with laptops, and who could maybe live without a 4G dongle if their apps supported it.<p>I have also thought a lot about the sailboat cruising community (see the last sailboat picture in the OP). There are many recreational boaters out wandering from port to port, using sparse wifi and sailmail (very limited email services via marine HF SSB radio). A lot of them blog and send text and email to their family, friends, and followers, but have to struggle to time their online windows. Just imagine a laptop app that lets people write emails and blog posts whenever they want (in the middle of an ocean), and maybe it uploads the text to their blog via sailmail immediately (but slowly), and then adds the pics automatically when they get to port and connect to wifi (or have a 4G dongle within range of a cell on the coast).<p>So not only are there online and offline states, but also limited bandwidth states such as sailmail (it allows short text emails in both directions, but not images).",1383682237

Add 4-5 plausible control variables that you do not document in advance (questionaire, sex, age...).<p>2.) Write a r-script that helps you do the following:\nWhenever you have tested a person increment your dataset with the persons result and run a:<p>t-test<p>u-test<p>ordinal logistic regression over some possible bucket combinations.<p>3.) Do this over all permutations of the control variables.\nHave the script ring a loud bell when significance is achieved so data collection is stopped immediately. \nAn added bonus is that you will likely get a significant result with a small n which enables you to do a reversed power analysis.<p>Now you can report that your theoretical research implied a strong effect size so you choose an appropriate small n which, as expected, yielded a significant result ;)",1383681874

I can&#x27;t think of anything that Git does better than Mercurial. I can certainly think of things it does in a needlessly more complicated way - the handling of remote tracking branches and the use of the index are obvious ones. Git&#x27;s fixation on branches over commits is a persistent deep source of pain for users around me. And you can pry revsets from my cold, dead hands.<p>Now, there was a time when Mercurial didn&#x27;t have bookmarks. During that time, if you wanted a good lightweight branching model, Git was your only option (er, well maybe bzr or Darcs were, who knows). I was never that excited about lightweight branching; the weight of heavyweight branches does not seem substantial.

They tend to sound very unrealistic and are all tinged with either hype or hysteria, depending on the source.<p>The news has had many articles that say the strip clubs and whorehouses in or near New York City are filled with women who are forced to be there.  Forced in the manner said here - &quot;they travelled with an escort who held a gun to their backs&quot; and so forth.<p>The news even said a strip club which I visited a few times, Gallagher&#x27;s, was like this.  It&#x27;s just ludicrous.  There&#x27;s no way girls were forced to stay at this strip club.  It&#x27;s risible.  I talked to some of the girls there before I read the nonsense article about them.  Some were from other countries.  They were there for the money.<p>There are very poor girls all over the world who would and sometimes do work in a strip club or whorehouse if they could make a lot of money.  Just like girls in China go to work in Foxconn factories for the same reason.<p>With so many willing women, why go through all the trouble of hiring a full-time guard to watch three women?  What happens when he goes to sleep?  They pull out the gun when they travel around?  It&#x27;s possible, but highly improbable.<p>What is she going to say, she wanted to move to the US to make money doing sex-related stuff, then didn&#x27;t like it any more with those people and still wanted to stay?  These stories that people are in locked rooms with guards who escort them around by gunpoint with their families at home under the gun as well - it sounds like something a 21-year-old Indonesian prostitute who wanted a visa to stay in the US would say.  The joke is that anyone would believe this.  It&#x27;s laughable.  I mean what else is someone who knowingly came to the US for prostitution going to say?  Her only option is to say that.  Oh, and she wants to stay in the US as well, of course.  I don&#x27;t have the ability to say if her story is true or not, but it makes no sense.  Every hole in the story is plugged by some improbably sounding story (&quot;You were moved from apartment to apartment, why didn&#x27;t you escape when they were continually moving you?&quot;, &quot;Uhh...someone was holding a gun to my back, yaa, that&#x27;s it&quot;.  This is what she actually said.  It sounds ludicrous).<p>Of course the shady nature of whorehouses in the US is helped by the fact that it is completely illegal in New York, unlike Nevada or European countries.  If there were legal brothels, then business for places like this one would dry up.<p>The hypocrisy is the US helped drive Indonesians into poverty when the CIA helped an Indonesian coup massacre hundreds of thousands of trade unionists etc. in the 1960s.  The hypocrisy is the US has a religious hysteria about sex.  The hypocrisy is the US has laws on the book making prostitution illegal, which is what could create something like this theoretically happening.  Women in poverty come to the US and work for pittance wages sowing shirts and pants together, but we never hear about how they have the gun at their back as they move from place to place and are enslaved etc.  But when religious fundamentalists hear sex is involved, then some form of hysteria sets in.<p>Then we hear excuses for the PRISM Big Brother government controls everything stuff because of all this hypocrisy.  It&#x27;s a win-win for big money and big government - ban a woman willing to have sex from a man with money from conducting a transaction (driving it underground and allowing situations like this to potentially happen), massacre the Indonesian left and drive Indonesians into poverty, and then get support for Big Brother tactics to stop the invented tales of prostitutes who &quot;escaped their captivity&quot; but surprisingly &quot;still want to stay in the US&quot;.",1383681600

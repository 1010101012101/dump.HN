5258819,comment,5257771,5258577,1,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> From my reading, four of the shader units in the PS4 are reserved for Compute Units; things like physics (just cause 2) and lighting (battlefield 3), which cuts the raw advantage from 50% to 16%. Apparently on the 720, developers will be able to choose how to allocate compute units across the cores.<p>You are reading bad sources. PS4 can allocate everything to graphics. And even if it couldn't, a lot of the graphics work in today's game engines is run as compute shaders anyway, so it would not matter in the slightest. The whole ""cuts the raw advantage"" spiel was concocted by fanboys to make themselves feel better. I strongly advocate that you pay no heed to anything said by anyone who mentions it.<p>> Mainly useful for stereoscopic images or 4k. How many people have 4k tvs and 3D tvs? 16 render output units are plenty for 1080p (the PS4 has 32).<p>Completely untrue. The load on rops doesn't depend on just resolution, but on what they draw. In deferred engines (which everyone uses now), you can often reduce load on other parts by storing intermediate results, spending more fillrate. On consoles, everyone designs their games to spend all the fillrate that is available.<p>Fillrate does, however scale linearly on resolution and frame rate, so if a game is designed to run on Xbox next at x resolution and y frame rate, to run at 2x or 2y you would need twice of it. Which is probably why Sony has exactly twice of it.<p>> At the cost of half the storage (4GB vs 8GB).<p>?!? What exactly are your sources anyway? PS4 has 8GB of GDDR5.<p>> Textures will probably be able to be larger on Durango<p>Umm, no. More memory means larger textures. The textures will be pretty much identical for the consoles.<p>> More of some things; less of others. Faster at some things; slower at others.<p>No, Orbis is strictly superior in everything. Which is my point.",1361469093

I reckon the system should also prompt you to forward the petition not only to friends and family with the same representative as yourself, but also friends and family who live in districts that haven't received many signatures yet (i.e. it should help fill in the holes).",1361469051

Why do we have to dig up and burn every ounce of coal and oil and natural gas? Why not divert all of that effort, money, and time, into something that will last until the death of our sun? In a few years time, we'll all have cheaper power, and far fewer concerns about the destructive means by which the fuel is obtained.<p>Even with zero emission (though not zero waste) coal power generation, there's still tremendous environmental and human life impact from its mining.

It's just a message board.<p>Rather than take the time to write a coherent response, I'm just going to hose the room down with bullets:<p>* If a tech company was heard to be rejecting candidates for not liking sports --- for instance, if well-qualified applicants were turned away for not knowing which teams were in the American League Central --- nerds would be on their lawn with pitchforks and torches.<p>* There are plenty of ""classes"" of that aren't protected. For instance, your political affiliation is fair game under the law. Discriminating based on personal politics seems reasonable to approximately zero of us.<p>* Age discrimination is both not regulated in the class of companies occupied by most startups and rampant across the industry.<p>* Lots of non-protected behaviors are in reality proxies for protected behaviors; in particular, ""culture fit"" is an extremely common proxy method to filter out older works and mothers.<p>* In the post we're talking about, the post linked in this thread, and even in Paul Graham's essays, there's a theme of startups having the privilege to ignore antidiscrimination laws early on. It does us no good to pretend that everyone's on the same page about protected employment classes when the most widely cited writings in the field say that the ability not to hire women who might have children is a benefit of starting a company.<p>* Environments where team members can't fit in if they don't drink, don't work noon-9:00PM, don't listen to the same music, don't play foosball, or don't each lunch with the team are common in startuplandia, but aren't intrinsic to the concept of a startup. You say you know people who were happier when they left these kinds of companies. But people are also happier when they leave companies where they're harassed. Surely that's not a justification for harassment!<p>* You say you picked up emotional language in the post, and thus (we infer) engaged with the content differently. You should be aware that studies show that people --- men and women alike --- engage with women differently than they do men. In particular, the ability to write a blog post and have it not be read as ""emotional"" is at least in part a male privilege. Try rereading the post, but this time, instead of coming to an early conclusion that it's emotional, tell yourself ""this is a radically different perspective on startup culture than I have; what can I learn from it?""<p>I'm an arrogant guy, but I'm not arrogant enough to assume everyone is on board with this (yet): it is immoral to reject candidates for reasons other than predicted ability to produce for the team, and it is immoral to rationalize non-performance rejections by inventing grounds to predict poor performance (like ""culture fit""). In most circumstances, I think it's probably immoral to run companies in a manner that would prevent qualified parents of small children from contributing. There are real culture fit issues, but the air has been so thoroughly poisoned by startup misbehavior that we're probably going to have to invent a new term to describe them.<p> <i>Can you spot the problem with this logic?</i><p> <i>Here's a recent study pertaining to the sciences: <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109*</a>",1361467907

They're great to have.<p>One night I came in from ""lunch"" (2nd shift...) and saw three guys standing around a laptop trying to make something work for a customer.  They had an Apache install which was supposed to log something to a given file, but they'd poke the machine with their browser and would get nothing in the log file.<p>I walked by on my way to my desk and one of them grabbed me.  I couldn't type anything (because one of them was already in the way), but I could see what was already on the screen.  It was a chunk of the config file and it looked a little like this:<p><pre><code>    <VirtualHost 72.3.x.x:80>
    # (directive to log to that file was here)
    ...
    </VirtualHost>
</code></pre>
I asked them to run 'ifconfig'.  They did.  The machine had 192.168.x.x IPs because it was sitting behind a firewall doing NAT -- a fairly common config for our customers.  Apache is pretty strict about matching things when you use an explicit IP+port, so it wasn't using that virtual host to service the hit, and thus the log directive wasn't used, either.<p>I just said, okay, change the IP on that line from 72.3.whatever to 192.168.whatever and reload the config and try it again.  They did, and it worked, so I continued back to my desk.<p>From what I heard, they had spent over an hour trying to figure it out.  I didn't type a single character and never even sat down.

It's a set of instructions, not a sound format. The awful music you might associate with MIDI was your crappy soundcard interpreting note instructions. When you send those MIDI instructions to a more capable device, the results can be much better.<p>Where this is exciting is not in that you can embed background music in a web page without the bandwidth required of compressed audio, so much as that it is a step toward further opening up the realm of building interfaces for professional musical instruments (and not so professional musical instruments).<p>Anecdote time: In the late 90s, I'd bought a Roland drum machine that I felt had a really horrible programming interface, and I wanted to put my budding programming skills to use and build a nice visual interface that emulated the more intuitive devices from the 80s - and I had no idea where to start.<p>Fast forward to a couple of years ago, and in the heat of the ""HTML5 can do anything Flash does"" debate, I decided to try emulating one of my drum machines using only HTML5 & CSS - <a href=""http://bitrotten.com/dr110/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitrotten.com/dr110/</a> - because while I felt it was impossible to do something like <a href=""http://www.audiotool.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.audiotool.com/</a> in HTML/JS/CSS, I wanted to put my money where my mouth was. (Result: Javascript timing is horrrrrible, audio handling is a work in progress, playback is inconsistent between browsers... Flash still wins by a very long mile on this front) But aside from the audio, I felt I could actually do a decent job of building out an interface.<p>I guess the point I'm getting at is that in the coming years, not only will audio improve, but with the ability to output MIDI, a very accessible set of free tools (as in, a text editor, and a web browser) means that fewer people will experience the frustration I had over 15 years ago when I wanted to roll-my-own interface for external music hardware.<p>Having said that, I think that solid timing will prove to be a formidable foe, particularly in a realm where you still have holdouts from the DIN SYNC era who say MIDI isn't responsive enough.",1361467312

When Garry says ""forever,"" I think he means in comparison to the now-dead posterous; & not necessarily ""forever"" as in ""All of God's Eternity""!<p>2.  At least you picked a decent name, PostHaven.  I always hated the name Posterous.  And the brown/yellow logo.  Ugh!<p>3.  As a non-techie I would pay $60/year for 10-blogs, BUT NOT if it will be as bad as Posterous which worked like pure crap for email-posting (yet that was their big Come On!)  From Summer 2009 for 6 months it worked fine, then something changed & it never worked well after that (only headlines would post with empty body content!!!)  Wasted TONS of time & energy trying to get answers from them & only got the run-around.  It was a miserable nightmare for 20-months when I finally bailed in Spring 2011 & went to WP.com, & that was after seeing a post at Computerworld that there was a bug between Gmail & Posterous!!!  Yet Posterous didn't know that?  Pfff!  Wp.com works excellent for email-posting & w/Gmail/iPhone.  Make it like WP.com & maybe will consider...<p>4.  Do not make the account-email address the ONLY addy that can be email-posted FROM.   Give us a ""special post to"" addy like WP does so we can post by email from ANY of our email addys, & not just the ONE connected to account.  That was another royal PITA thing about Posterous.  We should not have to add ALL of our addys as add'l ""users"" just to be able to post-by-email from DIFFERENT addys.  I cannot even express how arse-backward-miserable that set-up was!!  If PostHaven sets it up that same way, no thanks!<p>5.  Do not have Tags in the Subject Line like Posterous did!!  Did it ever occur to those guys we might send our post to Posterous & elsewhere at the same time? (such as Email Groups?)  Then the other list shows the stupid Tags in the Subject Line!  Bad idea!<p>6.  Don't make the Default ""Gallery"" so that we have to type ""NO GALLERY"" in every stinking email!  Or at least let US, the user, SET the DEFAULT CHOICE.<p>7.  Let us choose AT LEAST 1-global FONT for the blog body & headlines, VERDANA, crystal clear, best READABLE font.<p>8.  Let us choose AT LEAST 2-global Font SIZES for the blog body text & headline.  NO TEENY TINY STINKING FONT SIZES!<p>9.  Let us choose AT LEAST 3-global Font COLORS:  links, headlines, body text (#000000 BLACK body TEXT >> & NO STINKING ""INVISIBLE GREY"" FONT ANYWHERE!!)<p>WP.com wants $30/YEAR for the ""privilege"" to change global font, font size, font colors.  If it was a one-time-$30-fee, fine, but not every year (10 blogs would be $300 PER YEAR just to have a decent font!)<p>10.  Let us choose ALL Theme COLORS, background, menu bars, Blog's Title, etc.<p>11.  Themes:  WP.com & Posterous both have & had CRAPPY UGLY themes.  You can tell that it is mostly GUYS designing all the hideous themes, because women would know better! (design, colors, layout, FUNCTION), but unfortunately, we are not the tech geeks!  If PostHaven themes will be as crappy, it won't be worth switching, unless total flexibility is INCLUDED (see #8-9-10 above).<p>--Have several ""Magazine"" type themes, Photoblogging themes, Portfolio themes, etc., that actually WORK with EMAIL-blogging!  (Most of them DON'T, including the one Posterous had!  The first photo should show up on site but they never did! -- The only WP.com ""magazine"" theme that works w/email-posting is Triton Lite & it has a hideous white film over it & TEEEENY TINY INVISIBLE GREY FRONT, making it a total loser of a theme).<p>--Or, let us dl free or paid themes from 3rd parties elsewhere to use on our blogs & you guys could forego the whole themes disasters.  (WP.com has paid themes but quite pricey $75-$150, & I think you STILL have to buy the CSS Upgrade just to change fonts/sizes/colors!)<p>12.  Let us decide WHERE we want the DAY, DATE, & TIME of each post!  (At the TOP, under the Headline, NOT out to the side wasting space, NOR at the bottom of the posts!  Ugh!)<p>13.  WIDGETS!  & SHORTCODES! (for archives, search, RSS Feeds, Twitter Stream, HTML-Text-&-Images boxes, videos, etc.)  Frankly, I don't see why the wheel needs to be RE-invented... it must be a ""guy thing.""  Just copy what WP.com has already invented, but add the flexibility that WP.com does not include & I would gladly give you $60/year for 10-blogs.<p>14.  Oh, & allow users to have ADS!!!  Posterous was always promising they were going to allow users to have ads, but they never did (all the while they were Vigi-linking everyone's blogs!)<p>15.  And if being able to use our own domains is INCLUDED, that would be GREAT.  WP.com wants $18/Year for that privilege (10 blogs = $180) plus annual domain fees.<p>16.  Will PostHaven be hosting .PDFs, .MP3s, Videos, etc. like Posterous did?  That was ONE good thing!<p>17.  BUT I'm not willing to sign up in advance because there's no way to know if any of the other above miseries from prior Posterous & current WP.com will be the same at PostHaven or not.

It (hm, s/he) must therefore understand that it is (it must represent it as) an abstract quality in the sense that it can be had by different things (likewise with 'shape').<p>Well so what? This entails (I would argue) that it has the capacity to store and operate on abstract things (more or less the definition of 'symbol') - and in this very sense, the parrot has the faculty for symbolic processing/operations. Not only does it extract properties from sensory data and generalize them into concepts (things can be wibbly-wobbly-in-way-A, or wibbly-wobbly-in-way-B (first order of abstraction (well, n+1 really)) => things have wibbliness, and some things have the same kind of wibbliness (second order (or n+2))), but also, it may operate on these concepts and use them in assertion/negation propositions: some objects have the same color but not the same shape. (I use the term proposition in the more general logical sense, not necessarily as in 'a linguistic assertion'; but when asked, the parrot provides an answer that can be put in a truth-table so to speak.)<p>Interestingly, that's one of the ways to actually define 'semantic content': something which provides truth-conditions (e.g. some language-formalizing systems would say that the proposition ""The present King of France is bald"" has no semantic content / has no meaning because it is neither true nor false (presently there is no King in France, and the reference fails) (though Russell would disagree ('how can it be neither true nor false?') (if interested: ""On Denoting"", 1905.))<p>So what #2? Well, one could argue that symbolic apparatus + semantics (a set of truth-functions / grounds for constructing them) => 'language', so it's kind of a big thing, I'd say. (At the very least, evidence towards abstract thought in animals is always somehow very interesting for me.) Again: symbols (abstracting from properties => projecting these abstracts back onto sensory data) + symbolic processing (basically, ability to ascribe truth/falsity to/via them) => darn interesting. There's a whole hot debate how/whether this can be achieved 'bottom-up' from neural networks (Connectionism) (is 'symbolic processing' the proper way of reduction? Even if cognition is 'symbolic' in the end, perhaps it is best to model this starting bottom-up and arriving at 'symb.processing' as an emergent/epiphenomenal capacity?) - or, whether you need 'innate capacity' for symbolic processing / language ('language genes') - top-bottom language faculties (that all add up to those same neural networks, but simply, you won't get much by starting bottom-up) (Classicism / Nativism (not really interchangeable, using loosely / generalizing, etc.))<p>(<a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/#ConDeb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/#ConDeb</a> , <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/#ShaConBetConCla"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/#ShaConBetCo...</a> , etc.)<p></convoluted comment><p><i>edit</i> fixed and added even more confusing stuff.",1361466443

You should be able to write a simple bash script without needing to look up too much. You should be able to configure a LAMP stack from scratch without much hassle (looking at documentation here totally recommended).<p>I personally think the best way you can get started is by using the command line for everything ""work"" related. When you're doing your projects for school you should be using vim (or emacs if that's your thing). When you're navigating directories or performing file operations you should just use the terminal. Using the command line effectively is such a critical component of being an admin, and it just takes practice to get good at it.<p>The fact your doing computer science is a huge leg up, because you'll have a good understanding of the fundamentals of computers. When you work with linux you very often need to know the underlying mechanics of whatever you're working with. This goes hand in hand with being able to troubleshoot - a huge component of being an admin. Let's say you're troubleshooting an i/o issue on a server. When certain operations are performed on a SQL database in high volumes you notice the server starts to chug and i/o is severely bottlenecked. You need to know things like whether the RAID is configured correctly, and what the most optimal settings are for your usage. You need to know to check the i/o scheduler and make sure that's appropriate for what you're doing. Some of this stuff you won't know out of college, but you'll work with all of it eventually and pick it up. What counts is that you don't need somebody to explain the super basic stuff, you will already understand most things at a fairly high level. You should be able to pick things up quicker as a result, and cover significantly more ground than somebody learning Linux whose never really worked with computers seriously.<p>Anyway, that's longer than I meant to type up but hopefully you get the gist of what I'm saying.

Could the NSA be hacking your phone and retrieving this information? Nothing is impossible, but probably not if Apple has done what they describe.<p>A lot of the paranoia on Reddit and even HN seems misplaced to me. Federal and state governments already have large fingerprint databases. Most of you probably don&#x27;t even remember when the police visited your grade school and taught the class about finger printing. Guess that they were collecting. So it&#x27;s possible but unlikely that the federal government will collect your fingerprint data. However, we KNOW that the federal government is widely collecting communication metadata. This information is a much greater threat to freedom than your fingerprint. Both datasets are identifying, but one reveals a lot of additional information - about your lifestyle, habits, politics, speech, ideas, etc. The fingerprint conveys none of these.<p>The government has lots of ways to identify you if they want to. Most of these methods of identification are MUCH easier to implement than fingerprints (communication metadata and patterns, face recognition, license plate tracking, etc.). In the end, making a cell phone call is more convenient but less secure than other types of communication, but we accept this trade-off. The trade-off for using a fingerprint to facilitate dozens of daily interactions with your phone seems possibly more favorable in terms of privacy.",1378911210

6367519,comment,6357317,6366984,1,0,lambda,,,"What part of my evidence do you consider worse? The evidence of actual women who have avoided conferences because of harassment? Or you mean a paper that actually gathers statistics that demonstrate that women are more likely to leave male-dominated fields than ones which have a more even gender distribution?<p>And half of what I was complaining about was that you linked me to a 4 and a half hour long video series, which from a brief glance at the first video, appeared to be some guy just trying to get some Norwegian academics to claim that both sexes are exactly equal, and then catch them out on that. I had no idea where to look in those videos for evidence of the actual claim that you made, that once a profession is no longer taboo for women to join, they have less desire to do so. Could you please tell me where in those videos to find that evidence? Or, since he doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing any original research himself, just interviewing academics on a variety of topics, can you point out the research that he summarizes that contains this information?<p>> When you observe an uneven sex ratio in a particular field, you need to form a hypothesis to explain that ratio, and then test it. You can&#x27;t just jump to &quot;it is sexism&quot; as a conclusion.<p>The paper I linked to did test certain hypotheses about why it happened, and one of them that it found evidence for is that the larger ratio of men in the industry leads to more women leaving; which forms a self-perpetuating cycle.<p>You&#x27;re right, this doesn&#x27;t directly address sexism, but it does provide evidence for why there&#x27;s an uneven ratio, and why it continues to be that way, even if more women enter the profession than before.<p>> But since you skipped the testing the hypothesis step and went straight to a conclusion, you find this offensive and unimaginable.<p>But it&#x27;s not just the uneven ratio that we&#x27;re concerned about. As I said many times, there may be multiple reasons for it; perhaps harassment is only a small portion of the reason. It is obviously a part of the reason; as I&#x27;ve pointed out, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence for that, of people who have been harassed out of the industry, or out of certain communities within it. But you&#x27;re right, without a rigorous study, we don&#x27;t know how much of an effect that is, versus other factors.<p>The &quot;offensive&quot; part is denying that there is any harassment, and denying that men should try to stop it. There is harassment. There is behavior that makes women feel uncomfortable. Rather than being defensive and claiming that people shouldn&#x27;t jump to the conclusion that sexism isn&#x27;t the reason why there are few women in the field, why don&#x27;t we try to not act sexist, stop sexism when we see it, actively try to eliminate at least that problem? Perhaps it won&#x27;t lead to a lot more women in the industry, as they are avoiding it for other reasons. That&#x27;s OK; we&#x27;re still at least working to fix the sexism problem.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not claiming that all, or even most, men in tech are sexist. I&#x27;m not claiming that there is a unique sexism problem in tech. What I&#x27;m saying is that there is sexism, that it does hurt real people, and so if you see it, you should do something about it.",1378911181

(One of the very encouraging aspects of this battle is that it&#x27;s very much not breaking down by the usual lines.)<p>So the first thing to remember is that &quot;non-profit&quot; or 501(c) does not equal charity, although a normal charity will be a non-profit, and if they jump through the proper hoops and the IRS doesn&#x27;t politicize the process they&#x27;ll be a 501(c)(3).  Note that the IRS has very much <i>not</i> stopped its stonewalling, and we can expect anti-spying non-profits to get the same treatment that &quot;TEA Party&quot; et. al. groups have gotten ... something to think about if you don&#x27;t take to heard the advice written in blood about &quot;First they came for the....&quot;<p>So:<p>501(c)(3) organizations like the NRA proper or the EFF can do a variety of things including lawsuits, but when it comes to politics I think they can only &quot;educate their members&quot;.  Of course, if you use a web site as part of the latter....<p>501(c)(4) organizations like the NRA&#x27;s Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) can do explicitly political things.  Exactly how that breaks down is complicated, but they can do stuff like directly lobby legislators as long as that&#x27;s not most of what they do.  One very powerful thing they do is rate and endorse politicians and send out voter&#x27;s guides before elections, little &quot;just the facts, Mam&quot; postcards that show how the relevant politicians voted on issues their members care about.<p>But there&#x27;s a critical caveat here: this only works for the NRA/gun owners (NRA members inform their non-member friends of what they learn) because there are so very many of us, we have a <i>very</i> strong grass roots that&#x27;s by no means tied to the NRA proper (as some politicians have learned to their dismay), <i>and we vote</i>.<p>Look at the Total Recall of 2 Colorado state legislators including the Senate President due to their prominent roles in passing invidious gun control legislation.  This was done from the ground up, one of the 2 efforts was started by 2-3 plumbers who&#x27;d never done this sort of thing before.  The NRA only spent ~ $350K in the two efforts, the good guys were, last time I checked, outspent 8:1 by Bloomberg and the usual suspects, the MSM was on the anti-gun side, and the election laws had been ... curiously changed to make voting fraud very easy and it was brazen.  Yet given all that, two career politicians will very soon be spending more time with their families.<p>Which gets to our particular problem, which is that we don&#x27;t have that sort of grassroots, not will we if the NRA/gunowners are any guide before the national security state commits enough notorious atrocities, see here for more on this theme: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6185918"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6185918</a><p>Now to the more political organizations: the NRA of course has a PAC, the Political Victory Fund, but ever blessed post-Watergate campaign finance &quot;reform&quot; ensures the money they can give is purely symbolic.  I.e. it sends a signal to gun voters, but little else.<p>Then there are the newer 527 Super Pac organizations.  I haven&#x27;t studied them closely, but as I understand it they can do just about everything but &quot;coordinate&quot; their efforts with a political campaign.  But getting back to my above point about voting, unless you have a strong base of potential voters they can spend zillions of dollars without having anything to show for it.  For the latest notorious example of this, see how in 2012 the Republican Party national level establishment nominated a Northeast liberal politician for president, establishment organizations like Karl Rove&#x27;s American Crossroads spend 100s of millions, hismore than $100 million, and had nothing to show for it.<p>A political party that despises its base is just not going to do well.<p>We should take that lesson to heart and not &quot;despise&quot; <i>any</i> who agree with our cause unless they&#x27;re <i>utterly</i> toxic to it (I mean NAMBLA, Stormfront, and ALA levels of toxic).",1378910472

[1] (In reality, they were trying to but couldn&#x27;t figure out how because they used their PCB house&#x27;s free proprietary software which couldn&#x27;t export - we&#x27;re talking a tiny hobby operation here.)<p>Then he went against the very principles he publicly shamed others for failing to follow and turned MakerBot&#x27;s hardware and software proprietary in order to make more money.[2][3] All the people who politely but firmly criticised him for failing to live up to the same standards he held were accused of using &quot;language similar to that we usually hear from people who blow things up&quot; and &quot;fundamentalism&quot; by another maker[4]. This was linked supportively by one of the most prominent companies, Adafruit.[5] Anyone who suggested that comparing other members of the community to terrorists was incredibly inflammatory itself, or linked Bre Pettis&#x27; own views on others who took open hardware closed, was labelled a &quot;troll&quot; and had their comments deleted. People who correctly figured out that MakerBot was taking their hardware closed based on Bre&#x27;s non-denial denial[6] were called liars and accused of spreading rumours. Remember, Bre&#x27;s own public humiliation of newbies with much less power than him didn&#x27;t get this kind of criticism.<p>So yeah. I&#x27;m basically done with open hardware and the maker community. It looks like a way of suckering people into doing big businesses&#x27; work for them and then labelling them terrorists when they ask said businesses to uphold their end of the bargain.

(implementing zab yourself, at this point, would be a futile exercise.)<p>i found the videos from the raft user study to be very well done (and easier to understand than even their paper):<p>raft: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsBg0AO6o"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsBg0AO6o</a>\npaxos: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbZ3zDzDnrw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbZ3zDzDnrw</a><p>...however, i think they did paxos a disadvantage by not just focusing on multi-paxos (which is probably the most common implementation). but, it&#x27;s certainly fair to say that info about paxos is spread out far and wide...with perhaps too many knobs to turn and implementation-related details to fill in yourself.<p>as a side note: i&#x27;ve just started implementing raft in a set of libraries (multiple languages) that will be open source - along with other protocols.",1378909205

6367267,comment,6366762,6366762,3,0,betterunix,,,"The part about passwords and password recovery is a bit troublesome in my opinion.  If I am unconscious when I am brought to the hospital, the doctor should be able to access my records or release them to another doctor.  Someone showing early signs of dementia might throw out their token and have no memory of ever having a password -- what do you do then?  The threat is that an attacker might dump a database or steal a hard drive, not that a doctor might attack from the inside; doctors need to be able to access patient data under a variety of circumstances, including those where a patient is unable to give their consent or present a special token.<p>I think a better solution would be to give each doctor a smartcard, and to require some sort of threshold signature for certain operations (like sending patient data outside the hospital network) so that no single doctor has all the power.  Attribute based encryption comes to mind here, since the ciphertext should only be stored once but should allow any doctor to decrypt; nurses might also need some amount of decryption capability (and would then need a smartcard of their own).  Giving patients full control over their records sounds great on paper, but in practice people will forget their passwords and lose their tokens, and will probably not even realize the token is lost until they actually need medical care (and then it is too late).",1378909041

This means the process is shared in cases where the HTML standard explicitly requires that the child browsing context be able to navigate the parent opener or frame. So, at that point, required Web functionality achieves an equivalent to the DoS you mention. Process sharing can also be triggered when resource limits are reached or during page transitions, but that&#x27;s rarely a significant factor in practice and not controllable by a Web site.<p>And to be very clear, Chrome&#x27;s process isolation is far from security theater. The sandbox prevents renderer processes from accessing or manipulating any system state directly. It&#x27;s a hard security boundary that&#x27;s been extremely effective in preventing exploits. It also allows Chrome to entirely isolate different classes of renderer processes from each other, such as those used for Web content versus filesystem, extensions, apps, or system settings.<p>That stated, we&#x27;re still working on improving Web content isolation because our final goal is to entirely isolate different origins in the same class. But doing so is far beyond anything attempted in a production browser before, and entails a massive engineering effort. The team working on that has various bugs you can follow in our tracker, and a public design document:\n<a href=""http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-isolation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-iso...</a>",1378908656

We were told that we had to support all the way down to IE6. To do so, we raised our prices, almost constantly during that project, and they happily paid it.

For clients with an existing website, I check what percentage of their users use legacy browsers, and work out with them whether the cost of supporting these users against the potential benefit.

Want to raise 100k (an insignificant amount by SV standards)? Well you better get a good price for your kids in the black market because there&#x27;s barely any VC to speak of and banks do not give money to anything more complicated than a clothing shop.<p>Next is housing. Amsterdam is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, but it&#x27;s also one of the most expensive ones. Living inside the city ring (what people typically understand when you talk about Amsterdam) is extremely expensive. A 50-sqm-one-bedroom appartment will easily cost you $1500 (over 1000) and for the average person that means almost 50% of your netto salary. Go under that and you&#x27;re not really living in Amsterdam proper but the newer, and much less desirable, outer boroughs.<p>Finally there&#x27;s the issue with compensation. Amsterdam is plagued with yuppies in the finance/consulting/sales sectors for one reason: it&#x27;s what pays. In consulting 60k is almost entry level, and I&#x27;m talking about middle of the road companies. A senior engineer, someone with more than 5-7 years of real experience, is lucky to break 55k and will never get a raise once there. Lack of talent you say? Go 120km to the southeast and you have access to fairly hardcore technical guys. If you need more you have Germany right next to it which also has lots of technical talent. There is no shortage of talent here, there is a shortage of pay and of interesting work. And let&#x27;s not get into the highly unfavorable contracts offered, like mandatory non-compete agreements for up to two years and automatic ownership of everything you make in your own time with your own equipment.<p>In short, nothing will change unless there&#x27;s more money flowing around.",1378908061

LZMA decompression takes twice as much CPU time as gzip in the best case.<p>> I don&#x27;t think memory is an issue when we&#x27;re talking about decompressing some HTML/CSS/Javascript<p>Memory is not a function of payload size in compression algorithms, it&#x27;s a function of compression parameters. xz -9 will have ~65MB of memory overhead regardless of the payload size (and LZMA is flexible enough that you can craft a single payload requiring gigabytes of working memory, xz&#x27;s man even warns about it).<p>> CPU is barely an issue, considering how powerful modern mobile devices<p>CPU transitions are extremely aggressive on mobiles. The more CPU time has to be spent decompressing payloads the less the CPU can be in deep hibernation state and the more battery you burn through.<p>Not a tradeoff which makes much sense considering >3G bottlenecks tend to be latency and processing more than bandwidth for &quot;basic&quot; HTML/CSS/JS web content (and really most things outside of video streaming)<p>> New phones seem to have as much power and as much RAM as my 5 year old PC.<p>Phones usually can&#x27;t page out, and aren&#x27;t tethered to a wall.<p>Also depends which &quot;new phones&quot; you&#x27;re looking at, the Firefox OS-based ZTE Open has 256MB RAM and a 1GHz single-core Cortex A5.",1378908019

If so and you only subscribe to Internet then that is the same price here on the east coast for subscribing only to Internet.  Here with Comcast you can purchase limited cable TV (local channels and 3 to 4 cable TV chnnls) for about $10 and then the cost of Internet is $43.  You might want to look into that if you have Comcast!",1204711105

Or maybe I'm just fed up at people who never have to deal with cross-browser design getting uppity about someone using a table tag to ensure consistent display.<p>Either way, you're right. Lack of cross-browser consistency in CSS display support (vertical centering anyone?) is what makes implementing tables in CSS a living nightmare.",1204711084

129585,comment,129517,129517,0,0,trekker7,,,"You should definitely pursue what you love most, but by being practical you can avoid a lot of the obstacles that are bound to pop up when you take up this pursuit. I think you should stick with the programming, get a day job as a programmer, and try to pursue the arts (acting, painting, sculpting, whatever you like most) in your spare time. Maybe join a part time theater group or make paintings in your spare time and show them off on the Web or elsewhere.<p>By taking this route you make sure you have enough to pay the bills. Then maybe some day you'll make enough from your artistic pursuits to quit your day job and pursue the secondary career full time. At that point it'd probably be much easier to break it to your parents.<p>And I don't think you should make any impulsive moves, because what you love today, you might get bored with in a few years. Who knows, maybe in 5 years you'll love programming more, or you'll develop a taste for architecture, or you'll want to be a doctor. Or you may end up being a career artist. In any event you should follow your dreams... but minimize risk as much as possible by using a practical strategy.",1204709050

If you become a professional musician, you'll find that you have to take every gig which comes along, just to make ends meet; you'll find yourself saying 'dear god, not Beethoven's fifth symphony AGAIN'; and ultimately you'll end up not loving music any more.""<p>I figure that doing a startup is an ideal solution: It ""solves the money problem"" (as PG puts it), after which point you'll have the liberty to engage in the arts -- without ever being in the position where it becomes a job which you're forced into doing every day because otherwise you'll starve.",1204708560

129577,comment,128970,128970,0,0,xirium,,,"From the article: The population of the United States is almost entirely car-dependent, and relies on markets that control oil import, refining, and distribution. They also rely on continuous public investment in road construction and repair.  The cars themselves require a steady stream of imported parts, and are not  designed to last very long. When these intricately interconnected systems stop functioning, much of the population will find itself stranded.<p>I've seen this sentiment before, referenced indirectly from this forum:<p>Potholes may well be the singular measure of the calamity we are in or about to face. -- <a href=""http://www.kunstler.com/Grunt_SouthAfrica.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kunstler.com/Grunt_SouthAfrica.html</a>",1204707898

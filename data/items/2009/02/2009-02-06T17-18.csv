470037,comment,469620,469948,0,0,gamerates,,,"""Sex-Negative"" is a term sociologist/anthropologists often use to describe different societies. I picked the term up from reading some of Helen Fisher's talks/papers about sex and romantic love (<a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers/helen_fisher.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers/helen_fisher.html</a>).<p>Here is a really poor wiki definition of ""sex negative"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-negativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-negativity</a>).<p>""Sex negativity"" is more about a lack of tolerance of different forms and viewpoints of sexuality.<p>I don't think that upon reading the Catechism or looking at a history of the Catholic Church and it's view on sex/sexuality you come away with a very comfortable view of the actual sex act. Part of this may be due to the fact that those that wrote the doctrine were suppose to be chaste. It's interesting reading how the Catholic Church changed it's early viewpoint from allowing priests to marry early on, to outlawing it (in all but a few loopholes, such as getting the ""calling"" after you are married).<p>Most of the doctrine seems to view sex as some unfortunate necessity for procreation, not something to be celebrated by itself. It's never been that comfortable with sex for pleasure. This is in stark contrast to let's say the Greek/Roman societies before the rise of Christianity.<p>However, I feel like the word itself is partly biased because it assumes that a ""sex-negative"" viewpoint is bad and a ""sex-positive"" viewpoint is good (similar to the atheists movement to call atheism ""brights""... which makes it seem like everyone else is dims) instead of using more neutral definitions.",1233942962

470016,comment,469147,469727,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"I use jQuery all the time, I purposefully left it out of this example to reduce the number of variables causing the IE performance quirk.<p>I've found that jQuery UI plugins are bloated and slow, to be honest.  There focus is on providing a dead simple interface to the developer, who might not even know how to code.  I believe this leads to bloating the code and degrading performance, since the code now has to check for and include tons of these little edge cases, which can even compound themselves when they're used at the same time.  In the ""draggable"" demos, anything being dragged is quite laggy and choppy, at least in FF, when it definitely shouldn't be.<p>jQuery already makes it easy enough to build whatever functionality I want, including drag and drop... and since it's not generalized (as in the case of jUI) it's fast.  For drag and drop, 50 lines was all it took to pretty much copy the entire functionality of jQuery draggables... assuming the developer can code a <i>tiny bit</i> of functionality himself.  Rather than cram all sorts of microfeatures, like ""vertical-only"" and ""hortizontal-only"", I abstract the problem out so that it puts more control in the developer's hands, but still is dead simple.<p>In my case, the developer defines the ""init"" function (triggered after it's dragged for a given length or time), the ""move"" function (which is passed deltaX and deltaY) and the ""end"" function, all of which are passed events as well.  If he can't use this information to make something resize (which is just adding deltaX to originalWidth), for example, then that's too bad, he will have to use 42kb of jUI code to do it.<p>Another example of bloat and poor performance... if you wanted to create a Dialog, it requires Draggable, and Sortable, and comes to a total of 84kb (uncompressed).  It's so laggy then when you're moving it around the shadow appears to be chasing the dialog...  and resizing it lags half upwards of half a second.  With jQuery, I've made draggable, resizable, shadowed dialogs in like 200 lines.",1233941913

470012,comment,469620,469794,0,0,gamerates,,,"There's often a disconnect between the ""catholic viewpoint"" and the tones and reality that the theological doctrine is actually preached. Historically, Catholicism has not had a very positive outlook on human sexuality. Sex is great, but only if it is used exclusively for procreation. Anything that deviates from that, or sex for any purpose other than procreation, is seen as immoral.  I think it's hard to argue for a positive view of human sexuality if you think masturbation is a sin.<p>Just take a look at the Catechism:
""2352 By masturbation is to be understood the deliberate stimulation of the genital organs in order to derive sexual pleasure. ""Both the Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition, and the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action.""137 ""The deliberate use of the sexual faculty, for whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose."" For here sexual pleasure is sought outside of ""the sexual relationship which is demanded by the moral order and in which the total meaning of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love is achieved.""138 ""<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm</a>",1233941704

I saw one comment (#16) saying that SaaS vendors have the ability to charge by usage and should do so because companies wants to see the link between what they pay and what they use/get.<p>But that doesn't work for all products. Charging per usage can mean these two things:
1. The final cost might be hard to evaluate and can get out of hand. Some companies don't want that and want to be able to know in advance exactly how much it will cost.
2. It might tend to limit the usage of the software because you don't want to upgrade if you can get by with what you have.<p>But I'm not saying charging per usage is not good! I'm trying to point out that you need to look at the problem from different points of view (value you bring, your costs, etc.) and see what works best in your case.<p>Not everybody can charge depending on what costs them either. Many web-apps don't cost much to operate (if it's mostly displaying pages), so bandwidth costs wouldn't be enough.<p>Is it easy to give a price to the value you give to your customers? If you can say ""it saves you that much time vs. what you have right now"", it's easier than for ""make your customers happier thanks to a better service"".
Is there a metric that would make sense to charge for? Is that metric easy to grasp by your customers? I'm thinking of how Apple markets the sizes for iPod: by songs. 8GB might be obscure but 2000 songs is much easier: I know what a song is (about 3 minutes) and I can easily know how many I already have.",1233941129

I'm sometimes split between the views that religion is harmless and comforting for those who believe and should just be left alone, versus every service implicitly building the legitimacy of extremists.  If church (or islamic services, or temple) didn't happen normally, extremists would just be obviously crazy with arcane rituals from the past thousand years; but, since it's all so ingrained in our cultural experience, less of a leap is need to understand extremists, which builds this low-level legitimacy for many people, even if we believe that they're criminals.<p>Just by everything I've ever learned about reason and the scientific method, and everything I've ever read, while I can completely understand why people would _want_ to believe, it's completely mystifying as to why the vast majority of the world's population (well, in the free, information-rich societies) could make themselves believe.  It just doesn't make sense to me, given all evidence is so clearly, hugely against it. (Which, I guess, is kind of the point -- which also doesn't make any sense.)",1233940712

469984,comment,468807,469524,0,0,barrkel,,,"FWIW, it's not obvious that the one-thread one-connection blocking I/O design is terrible. How terrible it is is a function of address-space starvation from too many threads (a non-issue in 64-bit code), and the overhead of the OS thread scheduler. In a green threading model, I/O can be implemented behind the scenes as non-blocking I/O, but still give user code the ease of use of blocking I/O.<p>Back to Windows: overlapped I/O is not equivalent to poll, it's much better than that. It is edge-triggered, but Windows manages the threads itself, and tries to ensure 100% CPU utilization in user code, rather than in thread switching logic.<p>Windows overlapped I/O is effectively a way to write efficient I/O intensive applications in continuation-passing style. You don't need to manage the threads or dispatch loop yourself.<p>As to why use threads rather than processes, the issue is largely the awkwardness of duplicating the connection handle for a child thread. In Posix land, there's the fork function that makes handing off the handle fairly easy. WSADuplicateHandle can create a new handle that can be used by a child process, but you need to know the child process's ID first, so you need to perform IPC to just to send off the handle.<p>On the other hand, shared memory concurrency has its advantages too.",1233940662

When Hitler was invading Europe at the beginning of World War II Ghandi gave the citizens of Europe this advice...<p>I want you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions. Let them take possession of your beautiful island with your many beautiful buildings... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourself, man, woman and child to be slaughtered 
Now, I'm not as famous as Ghandi.  But I think I'm qualified enough to say the above was stupid advice.<p>Mahatma Ghandi did a great thing for the world in that he popularized a very powerful tool: Non-violent resistance.  But where he failed was in realizing his one tool didn't apply universally (in this case it only works if the person you are resisting is decent enough not to throw you in a gas chamber and kill you en masse)<p>The same thing is true with the author of this blog.<p>If I have any advice for him it's to see each ""startup success story"" as a tool that can create success in some situations.  The responsibility of someone wanting to use that tool is to determine which situations that tool applies to.<p>So when contradictory advice comes along he should ask himself ""why did that tool work for company X and not for company Y?""  Then decide whether you are closer to company X or company Y.",1233940080

By far the greatest effect came from 'past performance,' distantly followed by a having a math degree (for math teachers), and Teach for America experience. Almost negligible came the last item, 'having a masters degree.'<p>Next, Gates looked at the incentive structure within schools -- it's primarily seniority based, with a bonus if someone has a master's degree.<p>He noted that good teachers leave the system at a rate slightly higher than that of bad teachers.<p>He contrasted charter schools such as KIPP (<a href=""http://www.kipp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kipp.org/</a>), where the school evaluates teachers on their performance -- with the traditional model.<p>The traditional model contractually limits how schools can evaluate their teachers, for example, a principal is contractually not permitted to sit in on a teacher's class more than a few times a year (sometimes even once per year), and even those times, the principal must provide advance notice. Gates compared this to running a factory with some workers ""making crap"" but the management being banned from observing them without prior notice, so that the workers ""might actually try and fool you into thinking we're doing a good job in that one brief moment.""<p>Gates next noted that even a teacher wanted to improve -- can't.

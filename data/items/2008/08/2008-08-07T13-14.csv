So the parasite seems to help its original host organism in their common interest of staying alive.<p>There's more on that here: <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/technology/060210_technovelgy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescience.com/technology/060210_technovelgy.htm...</a>",1218116882
269613,comment,269212,269212,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"This is an awesome example, as the article says, of the extended phenotype of Prof. Richard Dawkins. The genes of the worm parasite for example, produce proteins which manipulate the central nervous system of the grasshopper, ergo, one has the genes of one organism affecting the behavior of another organism. I'm a big Dawkins fan, ever since I got 'The Selfish Gene'. I am particularly intrigued by the ability of the parasite to escape once its host has been preyed upon, so if a frog eats a grasshopper that has a worm in it, the worm can escape both the carcass of the grasshopper and the frog. In the end, the grasshopper becomes nothing more or less than the worm's mechanism of replication. One could view this as a restricted class of cases, however, I think one can generalize this by saying as some do, that in fact all life from parasites to ourselves is simply a form of intermediaries to preserve a relatively restricted set of phenotypes, i.e., we are indeed, like the grasshopper, ""gene carrying robots"". Of course I think I take a certain geeky pleasure from this knowledge, to be able to disabuse people of their quaint, deluded notions of life having mystical attributes, when in fact it is finally speaking a fancy chemical process brought about to preserve genomes, this, and nothing more! :-)",1218116842

It would be much more useful, though, if the parser kept structural information about where in the html tree a particular text fragment was found. Lines could still serve as the unit to which statistical analysis is applied (although that seems error prone), but knowing more about the structure would enable further processing down the line.",1218115890

Keep it.  If necessary, make it more prominent.<p>Don't overemphasize that you're in Beta.  While this is doubtless a milestone for you, new users could care less.  They want software that works well.  Use the front page to show them what your software does, why it works well and why they should want to sign up.  You can do this by highlighting what the software does for existing users, perhaps providing live examples.  Show, don't tell.<p>If you can, give people a way to play with your software without signing up.  Perhaps a sandbox, perhaps by not asking for login until they want to save what they've made.  You want people to start using your tool as quickly as possible, with as few barriers between them and the tool as possible.  Signing up is a huge barrier.  People won't sign up unless they want to use a service, and if they can't use a service until after they sign up, how will they know that they want to use the service?  Again: Show, don't tell.<p>Best of luck :)",1218115853

And, you can ask for that in writing. If you ask them ""how many hours a week am I expected to work"" and they say ""40"", but they fire you for working less than 60, then the company defrauded you. But, if they say ""60"" and they fire you for working less than 60 then you only have yourself to blame.<p>If you have a written statement about the hours you are required to work or be on call, you can pretty much never be fired for failure to work more without compensation.

269593,comment,269212,269475,0,0,time_management,,,"There are some who believe that fungi and plants like marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms actually co-evolved with mammalian nervous systems, as opposed to the more common theory that their psychoactive chemicals evolved as pesticides (like caffeine, which is deadly to insects). For example, one theory is that psilocybin developed to inspire herbivorous animals to break out of their routines and seek new ranges, defecating over a wider area and creating a larger habitat for the mushrooms. Terrence McKenna, though it should be said that he was far from a skeptical researcher, believed that psilocybin actually drove human evolution; for example, drug-induced synesthesia, mapping concepts to symbols, is his explanation for the emergence of language. (However, language has been shown to emerge naturally in the absence of psychedelic chemicals, so I find this to be particularly far-fetched.)",1218114483

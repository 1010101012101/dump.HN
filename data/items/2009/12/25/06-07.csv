1014825,comment,1014754,1014770,0,0,tibbon,,,"Very true. I've seen too many startups recently do a 'silent' laying off of everyone, closing doors, but leaving the servers up and the community to rot. The users don't even know that no one's driving the boat- but that servers are just still running because the prepaid their bills for the year. Unfortunate really.",1261723782
1014824,comment,1014533,1014663,0,0,nitrogen,,,"sizeof() is used to determine the actual in-memory size of something for use by memcpy/malloc/etc., not the number of elements.  There are commonly-used array size macros that can help with this, such as<p><pre><code>  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) sizeof(x)/sizeof((x)[0])</code></pre>",1261723632
1014823,comment,1013826,1014025,0,0,chrischen,,,"I think we still see innovation in games, but what's happened is there are also more clones. So every year we get a bunch of first person shooters, that are more or less the same type of game but with different storylines, graphics, and environments. So this drowning by copycat games makes it seem as if innovative new games are not being produced as much anymore.",1261723572
1014822,comment,1014533,1014679,0,0,nitrogen,,,"Other than strlen, string operations can be faster with null-terminated strings.  Plus, there are other benefits:<p>If you want to turn some arbitrary data into a string, just put a 0 byte where you want it to end.<p>Instead of having to increment and compare both a counter and a pointer (or store a final pointer for comparison) in string-manipulation operations, you just increment the pointer.  It makes for very concise loops in strchr, etc.<p>Tokenizing a string is just a matter of throwing down 0 bytes where the tokens are (as strtok does).<p>Passing a tailing subset of a string to a function is as easy as adding an integer to the string pointer, rather than requiring a memcpy and length calculation.",1261723329

I do plan to write all my experience on what we were trying to do, what went wrong and what I myself will correct when I build next startup.<p>About pulling the plug, We are thinking around couple of months process.

I simply wanted to point out that this ain't laser tag 2.0, but rather a new way to play the game. I want to emphasize their achievement in porting laser tag to the iphone platform, and not on their achievements of making shooting your friends possible.<p>Plus, all progress is either random, or iterative, so I'm not sure I understand your point.",1261722452

1014807,comment,1014549,1014549,0,0,ashley,,,"A similar idea is that of ""nudges"" as developed by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein.  Nudges are ways to create a framework of choice that is structured in a way to encourage people to make the ""optimal"" choice anyway.  It requires a bit of psychology in understanding the flaws in people's decision-making and perception.<p>Some countries have high organ donor participation merely because they structure it as opting out rather than opting in.  Instead of signing up as a donor, people have to sign a form to opt out.  Is it better than rewarding people who do opt in, as in the incentivized altruistic plan?<p>At least in terms of a retirement savings plans doing the same thing, I think the automatic opt-in mechanism is better, but organ donations are trickier because they usually involve some emotional or religious conundrum over organ donation.",1261721408
1014806,comment,1014754,1014772,0,0,jmathai,,,"Couldn't agree more. It is a fine line but start ups both require you to stick out the tough times but also know when to walk away. Definitely communicate with your users and don't drag it out. Reflect on what went right and wrong and use that at your next start up.<p>We wasted a lot of time because we knew our technology was worth something. In hindsight I wish we didn't drag it out. Weigh you options and make the best decision you can and don't look back.",1261721369

I spend time programming; not marketing.<p>I don't have an (active) twitter, facebook, myspace, linkedin, blog, etc. Yes yes I know how important it is to have them! - but the point is I don't.<p>So I always just build out things because I'm a semi-noob programmer. I've learned from experience, that its <i>all about</i> customer development, so that's what I will do now. But it is indeed factual that I have about 8 visits a day =).<p>Lastly, I am a 37 signals guy. I measure (company) success in profit. So it is nice to measure the importance of how many uniques you get, only so much as it contributes to the bottom line. I.e. A blog might need 50trillion uniques to make $x. A paid app, eh probably not so much.",1261721226

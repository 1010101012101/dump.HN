661567,comment,660674,661361,0,0,Keyframe,,,"I've just started using sass/compass for a project and I can tell I am more productive than ever, though I am using 960.gs instead of blueprint with compass. I am using compass for sass/960 and staticmatic for haml - so I can output a set of html/css files which are used in my  php project.<p>I am loving it, especially since staticmatic has preview mode and compass has --watch mode - so I have both running and auto updating my preview while I work on it. Even if I didn't use haml at all and no framework (960), it would still make sense for sass variables and mixins with input variables alone.<p>building sites that work across browsers is easier with reset+some framework, but I still have to have IE7+ specific css, and compass seems a bit moody on windows.<p>edit:
I am not sure if I would be comfortable using anything external to css to output css that has the same syntax, like less seems to have - it would most likely pollute my way of thinking down the road.",1245228907

Most of them seem to be a bit, ah, brand conscious (thus going for slicehost over linode)  so I haven't bothered to push the idea.<p>But yea, if any YC company needs free hosting (and really, hosting is so cheap these days that it's all pretty much free)  I'd be happy to give it to them.     I'm younger than linode, but I've been renting Xen VPSs since 2005, which makes me older than slicehost, I believe.<p>I'm not asking you to go exclusive or anything (in fact, I think that's a bad idea.   don't host all your stuff with the same provider.)<p>That said, I'd be a little surprised if any of the YC companies have to pay for hosting.

Monads have changed the game completely by providing a very clean encapsulation of side effects in general. There are people who are trying to generalize it even further using what are called ""arrows"", but just groking Monads in Haskell will give you a new understanding, somewhat along the lines of what learning exterior calculus does to your view of traditional vector calculus.",1245228369

661556,comment,658805,658805,0,0,rdl,,,"The way I've been doing something similar is to take deployed defense contracts which last 3-9 months at a time (Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.), and make enough during that period to live for the rest of the year (and a couple additional years).<p>I've also been working on startup projects in my spare time, since I have good Internet connectivity while doing the day job.  The ""non-deployed"" time can be spent traveling, or working full-time on any of the startup projects which have traction -- with the added benefit that I can provide my own financing up to a series A.<p>Somehow I get more done on projects in early stages when they're ""side projects"", and this way I don't have to worry about my burn rate during early stages (since it's substantially negative).<p>There are tax benefits ($91k/yr deduction) for being outside the USA 330 days/yr, so once you've done 200-250 days deployed as a contractor in a year, it makes sense to spend the balance outside the US as a tourist -- at a high marginal tax rate that's basically $30k, and I can live comfortably in Vancouver, Bali, New Zealand, Japan, etc. for a few months on way less than that.<p>The #1 thing I've learned is to totally automate my ""administrative life"" -- I use a mail-scanning mail forwarder, autopay on all my bills, etc.  When you travel a lot, it's easy to miss a credit card bill, and it can be a black mark on your credit for 7 years.<p>The other nice thing is most of these contracts are ""go home at night and not worry about it"", vs. normal consulting where you can be called back at any time to fix something.  And, the separation between dayjob and any personal projects is a lot easier in an admin/ops contract than in a developer dayjob.",1245227640

661552,comment,660450,660450,0,0,gaius,,,"I am really suspicious of these 100:1 metrics because I don't think they're across the board. That is - they apply to different people at different times. Let me give you an example. One thing I do at work is crunch numbers and make predictions. I do this a lot, and I can grab data from all over the place, parse it or munge it, fit curves, draw graphs, show how two or more datasets are correlated, package all this into a nice report, schedule it to run regularly or generate the report in response to some event, blah blah. Sometimes I can turn around requests in just a few minutes because I have a ton of Python I've already written, I know where to find all the data, and so on. Another <i>equally talented</i> person could take a week or two to do some of this stuff, if they started from scratch and didn't have my mathematical background. And there's stuff they can do that I'd be so much slower at. For any given task, 100:1 differences in performance between team members is <i>normal</i>. Over time, tho', over a range of tasks, I doubt there's even a 5:1 difference within most teams, maybe not even 2:1.",1245227393

And they have unfolded in a manner that's entirely plausible and did not require the involvement of non-Iranian third parties to get to the point they're at now. Until any plausible evidence emerges that significant numbers of tweets were forgeries, I think the more reasonable position to take is to assume they're real and Iranian. Of course, this does not mean they should be automatically believed, as like all low-level eyewitness accounts they are necessarily subject to inaccurate rumours, flawed conclusions, personal biases and all the rest, but the mere fact that many of these tweets are inaccurate does not imply that they weren't posted in Iran and it does not diminish their value in letting the rest of us know what it's like for ordinary people at street level in Iran's cities.",1245226524

Now presumably he or she is advocating intervention on the side of the opposition.  An opposition that may have been unsuccessful at the ballot box it must be said.  At the same time he is being upvoted by people, I am assuming like yourself, who are saying it's:<p>""Time for the rest of the world to just stand back and let Iran decide its own future""<p>What is being discussed by the OP, and on this thread however, is how to help the protesters.  I was giving my reasons for a careful consideration of the consequences of helping these particular protesters.  Let's be honest and admit that people here are discussing something other than self rule.  And it is my opinion that whenever we start talking like that, things go horribly wrong.

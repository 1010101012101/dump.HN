But it doesn&#x27;t have to look at the contents of strings, byte slices, int arrays, etc., because, by definition, those don&#x27;t contain pointers.<p>For dl.google.com, the first user of groupcache, it sounds like the Go runtime was working with relatively few, relatively large chunks of memory (think 2MB chunks of a Chrome binary). Since that doesn&#x27;t have so many pointer-containing objects, just big chunks of inert data that don&#x27;t need scanned, it&#x27;s easyish. On the other hand, something like throwaway2424&#x27;s case could be a GC stress test--many gigs of RAM holding a network of small, pointer-filled objects.<p>Really, the tl;dr may be to prototype/measure if you need to know how a GC will do.

6125363,comment,6125067,6125324,1,0,johnbm,,,"&quot;I read more of the diplomatic cables published on the Department of State Net Centric Diplomacy. With my insatiable curiosity and interest in geopolitics I became fascinated with them. I read not only the cables on Iraq, but also about countries and events that I found interesting.<p>The more I read, the more I was fascinated with the way that we dealt with other nations and organizations. I also began to think the documented backdoor deals and seemingly criminal activity that didn&#x27;t seem characteristic of the de facto leader of the free world.<p>Up to this point,during the deployment, I had issues I struggled with and difficulty at work. Of the documents release, the cables were the only one I was not absolutely certain couldn&#x27;t harm the United States. I conducted research on the cables published on the Net Centric Diplomacy, as well as how Department of State cables worked in general.<p>In particular, I wanted to know how each cable was published on SIRPnet via the Net Centric Diplomacy. As part of my open source research, I found a document published by the Department of State on its official website.<p>The document provided guidance on caption markings for individual cables and handling instructions for their distribution. I quickly learned the caption markings clearly detailed the sensitivity of the Department of State cables. For example, NODIS or No Distribution was used for messages at the highest sensitivity and were only distributed to the authorized recipients.<p>The SIPDIS or SIPRnet distribution caption was applied only to recording of other information messages that were deemed appropriate for a release for a wide number of individuals. According to the Department of State guidance for a cable to have the SIPDIS [missed word] caption, it could not include other captions that were intended to limit distribution.<p>The SIPDIS caption was only for information that could only be shared with anyone with access to SIPRnet. I was aware that thousands of military personel, DoD, Department of State, and other civilian agencies had easy access to the tables. The fact that the SIPDIS caption was only for wide distribution made sense to me, given that the vast majority of the Net Centric Diplomacy Cables were not classified.<p>The more I read the cables, the more I came to the conclusion that this was the type of information that should become public. I once read a and used a quote on open diplomacy written after the First World War and how the world would be a better place if states would avoid making secret pacts and deals with and against each other.<p>I thought these cables were a prime example of a need for a more open diplomacy. Given all of the Department of State cables that I read, the fact that most of the cables were unclassified, and that all the cables have a SIPDIS caption.<p>I believe that the public release of these cables would not damage the United States, however, I did believe that the cables might be embarrassing, since they represented very honest opinions and statements behind the backs of other nations and organizations.<p>In many ways these cables are a catalogue of cliques and gossip. I believed exposing this information might make some within the Department of State and other government entities unhappy. On 22 March 2010, I began downloading a copy of the SIPDIS cables using the program Wget, described above.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/01/bradley-manning-wikileaks-statement-full-text"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/01/bradley-manning-...</a>",1375157978

4070219,comment,4068895,4068895,1,0,TheCount,,,"Airtime, or something like it, has great potential to shake up online dating. I've tried several online dating sites, and it's clear their basic functionality is extremely flawed. I've always felt that you can learn more about your chemistry with someone by talking to them in person in five minutes than through hours of mutual profile gazing or stilted correspondence. Turns out researchers feel the exact same way[1].<p>Even IM mimics natural conversation far more than long-form messages back and forth. Yet people will spend more time poring over profiles than actually talking to people, and all that filtering is of questionable effectiveness.<p>It ends up making women more superficial, leaving them to decide more on factors like height, looks, race and income, than they would in person. I say women, because they are the one doing the choosing, at least among younger users. Women get swarmed with attention, and the odds are stacked against individual men. But the men who do get chosen get chosen often, and they are free to conduct several concurrent relationships.<p>Imagine if employers decided to hire the top 10% of a pool of candidates, and there was lots of overlap in what each employer's chosen 10%. Most importantly, these candidates could hack it so that they could work for multiple employers concurrently, instead of having to choose one, the one with the best fit, salary, benefits, etc. Then the employers, especially the less than spectacular ones, find that their talented employees are always behind on their work, and will quit at a moments notice. Still, the employers have tasted the brilliance of this talented tenth, and are unwilling to drop their standards, despite the obvious drawbacks. They keep telling themselves that all the problems with previous hires wont crop up again, because theyll uh, be extwuh extwuh careful this time.<p>That's what online dating promotes. Girls may find themselves getting 'played,' with a man totally unwilling to have a monogamous relationship, because they've priced themselves out of the monogamy market. This whole scenario has some real life parallels. [2]<p>Of course, this phenomenon is nearly as ubiquitous in the real world  plenty of girls are comfortable sleeping with men who are sleeping with other men. They may not <i>like it,</i> they may try to badger the man into monogamy, but ultimately they chose him, and his ways, because they implicitly prefer him to the men who would agree to monogamy from the outset. They arent honest with themselves, so they tell themselves that Mr. Sexy will become Mr. Reliable [2], when reality says not really. If they want to spiral through chaotic relationships and periods of elation and disenchantment, the status quo is great. If they want something a little less rocky and a little more consistent, theres room for change. Hell, a video solution would increase the truth in advertising, so both would stand to benefit. The truthier online dating is, the less you have to rifle through people that dont quite live up to the billing. Lower transaction costs  more transactions.<p>For something that purports to start new serious relationships, the status quo approach blows. A solution like video gives you more exposure to fewer people, reducing this phenomenon of runaway selection. It will always be present though, due to the nature of female sexuality, just as mens penchant for variety abounds.<p>It's possible looks could become even more important with video, but personality will likely become a bigger factor than it is now. Video is a great step towards getting strangers past the 'activation energy' needed to meet up in person. And there are girls who honestly desire a real relationship, and dont get caught up in trying to meet the best man possible  these women find a suitable man quickly and easily, provided they are reasonably attractive. But they are something of an outlier on online dating sites.<p>The online dating industry is stagnant. There are a couple big players who achieve growth only by buying up other entrants, or plagiarizing a startup like How About We once they see a concept well executed. You have sites like JDate that have 1996-era interfaces, and the speed to match.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/06/us-internet-dating-idUSTRE8151SL20120206"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/06/us-internet-dating...</a>

You may think people care about them, but believe me, they don't.<p>Enterprise people need solutions to their problems and answers to their questions, no matter how pretty.<p>Just one (out of thousands) of everyday examples:<p>I already know from existing reporting that 984 orders (18% of our backlog) are already past due. For those
984 orders:<p><pre><code>  - How many are for one item and how many are for multiples?
  - Do we own what we owe those customers?
  - If we do own it, is it in the proper warehouse?
  - If it is in the proper warehouse, can we find it?
  - If we can find it, is it undamaged and certified?
  - If it's shippable, do we have enough labor to ship it?
  - If it isn't certified, how soon can QA certify it?
  - If it isn't in the right warehouse, can we move it?
  - If we don't own any, where can we get some?
  - Which vendors have it on the shelf?
  - Which vendors do we have blanket purchase orders with?
  - Which vendors do we have contracts with?
  - Which orders can be split to satisfy a partial?
  - Which orders are for customers already on credit hold?
  - Which customers are threatening not to renew with us?

4070198,comment,4068561,4068561,4,0,david_shaw,,,"Here's my simple response to a particularly complicated (and touchy) issue: children that do extremely well on standardized tests, especially from an early age, do not need them. If you're consistently in the 90+ percentile in reading comprehension, critical thinking and mathematics from an early age, you are probably not only great at standardized tests, but an intelligent child to boot. These are the kids that should be playing with real-world physics applications (rockets) or rudimentary robotics (Lego Mindstorm).<p>If, however, you're a child that does consistently <i>badly</i> in these tests, it probably makes sense to get the book learning straight before venturing forth into the practical applications of math and science. After all, the point isn't supposed to be to play with rockets, it's to understand the physics behind them (right?).<p>Unfortunately, this is an unfair line to draw. Should smart kids get to play with cool science projects while the kids who are struggling--or who were sick on the day of the standardized test--are stuck inside studying ""the basics"" needed to understand these projects? Personally, I don't think that's fair line to draw.<p>The result? Everyone needs to be book smart, and hopefully, everyone should <i>also</i> build cool stuff with science.",1338922406

Cache byte code: Use APC or XCache PHP opcode cache.<p>3. Cache and minimize database I/O: reduce database touches using memcached, redis, file caches, and application-level caches (ie. global vars)<p>4. Do event logging in local files, not to the database: Make all write operations as simple and fast as possible, any data that is not needed in realtime can be written to a plain old file and processed later.<p>5. Use a CDN, especially for delivering static assets<p>6. Server tuning: Apache, MySQL, and Linux have lots of settings that affect performance, especially the timeout settings ought to be turned down.<p>7. Identify bottlenecks: At the system level use tools such strace, top, iostat, vmstat, and query logging to see which layer is using the most time and resources. Also there's an excellent PHP code profiling service called New Relic that drops you right into the function and db query that's eating up most of the time in slow requests.<p>8. Load testing: DoS yourself. Stress test your stack to find bottlenecks and tune them out<p>9. Remove unused modules: For each component in the stack unload any default modules that are not needed to deliver your service.<p>10. Don't use ORMs and other dummy abstractions: Take off the training wheels and write your own queries.<p>11. Make the entry pages fast, simple, and cacheable. Nobody is reading that silly news feed in bottom corner of your front page and it's killing your database, so take it out.<p>Most of the time a PHP slows down because each PHP process is blocked waiting for I/O from some other layer, either a slow disk, or overloaded database, or hung memcached process, or slow REST API call to a 3rd party service ... often just strace'ing a live PHP process will show you what its waiting for ... in short, blocking I/O slows down everything. The key to going faster is:<p>* keep it simple<p>* cache as much as possible in local memory<p>* do as few blocking I/O operations as possible per request",1338921607

4069951,comment,4066819,4067101,3,0,quantgenius,,,"The solution is NOT simple.  I suppose it always seems simple to impose rules on a system you don't understand.<p>Thousands of systems would need to change at brokers, banks, clearing firms, trade processing firms etc including mainframes running Cobol software that was written in the 70's at quasi-governmental firms like the DTC.  Documentation for these systems is mainly non-existent or incorrect.<p>What happens now is that at the end of the day registered brokers net out all trades done by them and send files which include trade details and net trades to the DTC.  On T+1, you and T+2 you figure out what would fail and why.  For example, let's say Zuckerberg sells some FB.  Based on FB's corporate bylaws his shares change class when he sells them so they have fewer voting rights.  So when he sells them the system at his brokerage barfs because the cusip does not match the publicly traded share cusip which then leads to a cascade of fails down the line because whoever he sold it to may have sold it to someone else.<p>You can't just automate rules like change the class of stock if Zuck sells it because the rules are different for every company and the rules change as the board adopts new bylaws and companies change their capital structure and the systems can't change that quickly because they have to be super, super reliable.  If the DTC's clearing systems go down, the US economy has a BIG PROBLEM.<p>About 1% of trades result in a potential failure to deliver on T+1.  The vast majority of these are resolved between T+1 and T+3 so that the trade clears.  Some don't.  It could be something like an investor who still holds paper certificates delivering them to the broker but the courier was late etc.  Resolving these fails often involves the company's registrar in addition to financial systems, for example FB's registrar would have to change the class of stock if Zuck sold his stock.<p>Company registrar's aren't exactly paragons of customer service.  Companies generally want to hire the cheapest firm because to them it's just an added arcane expense.  The registrar provides service to a back office guy at a broker, and he back office guy really doesn't have a channel to complain to the company's CFO.  So the registrar generally has no incentive to provide good service and the company has no reason to fire them and change them because as far as the company is concerned it's just a expense they want to minimize and changing registrars is a huge headache.<p>A failure to deliver does not mean the trade is somehow cancelled.  It means that either the broker or the seller needs to find stock that is good to deliver.  If you go out to T+10 and there isn't a VERY GOOD DOCUMENTED reason for the fail, like a tardy registrar, the buying broker and DTC will demand deliver and buy you in if necessary, ie buy the stock in the open market and deduct your account for the cost including a generous commission for themselves.  So a fail is generally a very bad thing that a seller and his broker really, really want to avoid.<p>Pre-2008 the rules around short selling were that if a stock was widely available for borrow, you could short it without checking.  Widely available means many different owners willing to lend the stock at reasonable prices.<p>In 2008 in a totally made up frenzy the, same SEC which failed to stop Madoff decided to impose a new rule stating that you needed affirmative determination of a borrow before you shorted a stock.  The rule makes no sense because if there were to be an event that would cause a widely available stock to suddenly become not available, you would still have fails.  Remember settlement is T+3, so you would check the accounts of the people willing to lend the stock and see that they still had the stock there without realizing that it would be gone in 3 days.<p>The SEC subpoenaed pretty much everyone because they decided that of course the market and particularly financial stocks were going down due to naked shorting as opposed to uh'm the economy and found essentially no evidence of manipulative short selling.  They brought one case against a tiny broker who made a minor paperwork error essentially unrelated to affirmative borrow other than a truly tortured link link between the two made in the SEC's press release.<p>Short selling is a GOOD THING.  Remember in any market, the people who have the biggest influence on prices are the ones who have amassed the most capital by consistently being right.  When someone who has been consistently right decides to sell a stock short, s/he is providing a very valuable service to the economy by signaling that what she's shorting is overpriced.  Remember shorting is very risky.  The price of a stock has no upper limit but can only go as low as 0.  So when you short you can make at most the current price of the stock but lose an infinite amount.  Also remember that when you short, you also have to buy the stock back at some point.  There are those pesky people you borrowed the stock from who want you to return it.  So on average you are selling the stock when it's overpriced and buying it back when it's underpriced and the price is under pressure.  The overall mechanism creates a very valuable self correction mechanism that is absolutely essential for a healthy market.  If the SEC really cared about the market's health as opposed to PR, they would be working to make shorting easier because it prevents bubbles.<p>Remember that the total amount of short interest in a stock is a publicly available number.  If the stock of a company you are an insider of is heavily shorted and you think it's cheap and you actually believe it as opposed to want to create a huge hullabaloo,  you can go out and buy it, make noise about the fact that you are buying it.  If the stock is genuinely cheap or even fairly priced, you will generally create a short squeeze where shorts are forced to buy back quickly as the stock shoots up in their face.  OSTK insiders did not do that.<p>I don't actually know of a single instance where an insider or corporate inside has complained about a short seller shorting their stock and pushing the price down where there actually weren't genuine problems with the company.  Remember it often takes 2-3 years for the whole story to come out and by then the media may not want to acknowledge that they breathlessly repeated every bit of tripe the CEO said about the evil, faceless short sellers.  Usually a CEO complaining or a company filing a lawsuit against a short seller is a very high probability sign that the company is in genuine trouble because otherwise you would see insiders backing up the truck to buy the stock.<p>I find it truly amazing that the press and from the comments even the supposedly informed set at Hacker News would get worked up about this when it's about OSTK, Overstock.com.  They sued people for shorting the stock and driving the price down for 60 dollars a share!! by making negative statements about the company that weren't true.  With the benefit of hindsight it's clear that pretty much everything negative publicly said about OSTK was not just true but probably too optimistic, and the management has been lying which is felony under US law.  Yet the SEC refuses to prosecute the management which is who is truly responsible for fleecing gullible retail investors.<p>It's truly astounding that OSTK is now choosing to go after GS based on snippets of emails etc which sound bad if you don't understand financial terminology and also don't have context but really aren't anything particularly bad, unless of course you let Tabibi self-aggrandize himself by claiming he understands stuff he has absolutely no clue about.",1338920080

Basically, a reward of 50% of the time is far more addictive for Julio and his pals than 100% (eg. the Staff of Beatings only drops 50% from The Butcher). Diablo 2 uses a traditional variable reward schedule for its loot system, as seen in most other RPGs. Diablo 3 uses gold (stick with me). You need gold to get the items the game requires you to have from the AH, and you're mostly burning the loot you find in-game for gold on the AH or other mats. This means that you're working on a small, 100% drip feed, which you eventually cash out in a predictable fashion. Not as addictive!<p>I don't agree with your assertion of a frustration loop being different. Diablo 2 could be just as frustrating if loot you needed didn't drop in time. One thing I think Blizzard has done very poorly is that AH transactions do not provide instant gratification, but take up to 48 hours to process(!). This means if you are in a rut, you'll have two days stuck in it, and perhaps just break the habit and leave altogether.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/299/5614/1898.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/299/5614/1898.full</a>",1338919966

Three million? How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?<p>> So let's get Bill Gates out of the way right now. It's not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky.<p>> There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, and win the lottery. Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS. No doubt Bill did everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if there had been one person with a brain on IBM's side, Microsoft's future would have been very different. Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM. They were effectively a component supplier. If IBM had required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft would still have signed the deal. It would still have meant a lot of money for them, and IBM could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.<p>> Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more innovative products reasonably promptly.<p>> If IBM hadn't made this mistake, Microsoft would still have been a successful company, but it could not have grown so big so fast. Bill Gates would be rich, but he'd be somewhere near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.</i><p>So ""luck"" largely took Bill Gates from millions to billions, a 100x to 1000x multiplier.",1338919926

Ok, well it's just math right? Yes, and no. Excel actually has a lot of bugs with the execution of their formulas, so to be accurate you have to emulate all the mistakes they make. You also have to discover these bugs yourself, as they are not conveniently documented somewhere.<p>I ended up writing a unit test framework using generated Excel spreadsheets containing permutations of formulas with every possible input, just so I could identify where these bugs might be happening. Then you have to reverse engineer WHY they happen in the first place, and also find out if this was something the Excel team fixed in later releases, or left in because they themselves could not break backwards compatibility.<p>And this was what I would consider a small problem for us back then. The biggest problem was always round-tripping of unsupported data. The Office file format is large, complex, and full of crap you wouldn't imagine supporting in a mobile product. However, your users expect that if they open a spreadsheet to change a number on their phone, when they save it and re-open it on the desktop all the fancy formatting and pivot tables still work and haven't been lost.<p>Anyways, this is a great purchase for Google and I congratulate all the guys who have put in the hard work to make Quickoffice the amazing product it is today.",1338919382

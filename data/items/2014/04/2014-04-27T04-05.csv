It was the culture that you will drop whatever you are doing to answer this one very specific question that was the problem.<p>Now my team had a very good manager who knew the system and pipeline. So if he was 95% sure he knew the answer, we never got the email. If he didn&#x27;t, he would forward it onto the oncall. And the oncall might forward it onto someone else if they were busy with a Sev1/2 issue.<p>But it was expected that you would drop what you were doing and answer. I&#x27;ve seen devs get up during the middle of lunch and go back to the office to answer a Bezos question.",1398574776

To quote Ravitch again:<p>&quot;The chief of malaria research for the World Health Organization, Dr. Arata Kochi, complained in 2008 that the Gates Foundation was stifling a diversity of views among scientists, because so many of the world&#x27;s leading scientists in the field were &#x27;locked up in a &#x27;cartel&#x27; with their own research funding being linked to those of others within the group,&#x27; making it difficult to get independent reviews of research. The foundation&#x27;s decision-making proces, he charged, was &#x27;a closed internal process, and as far as can be seen, accountable to none other than itself.&#x27; In a statement that had implications for the foundation&#x27;s education initiatives, the scientist said that the powerful influence of the foundation &#x27;could have implicitly dangerous consequences on the policy-making process in world health.&#x27; In other worlds, the Gates Foundation was setting the international agenda, because of its unrivaled wealth, and unintentionally shutting out competing views.&quot;",1398574315

Also he mentions types not being necessary to understand monads, but immediately launches into a description of the bind and unit functions by, you guessed it, stating what the types of the function&#x27;s were and what kinds of things they returned (I.e. the exact thing he said he wouldn&#x27;t talk about on the previous slide).<p>That being said, I liked his reworking of bind to be a method on an object. I agree monadic computation is tedious to read when you don&#x27;t have an infix bind operator, and his trick of turning bind into a method solves that pretty well in a language like JavaScript.<p>I think he&#x27;s probably overstating the case that what he calls ajax chaining is always monadic (but what most of us who didn&#x27;t write a competing library would call jquery style method chaining).

Haskell has no obligatory type declarations due to global type inference and <i>nobody</i> is calling Haskell untyped.<p>Untyped means untyped. None of the APIs or code are built around types, structurally or by name. It&#x27;s just a one big union type of possible JavaScript values all over the place even if that&#x27;s not what you meant when you wrote the function.<p>Being interpreted has nothing to do with type-checking. Haskell&#x27;s REPL is an interpreter. Using a library (Hint) you can eval arbitrary Haskell from strings in a type-safe manner.<p>You can even parse arbitrary data from strings in a type-safe manner without resorting to an interpreter:<p><pre><code>    -- throws error\n    read &quot;blah&quot; :: Int \n\n    -- returns 1\n    read &quot;1&quot; :: Int\n</code></pre>\nvia the magical joy that is Haskell typeclasses. Trivial but still very nice stuff.<p>Type-checking requires statically derivable information. You won&#x27;t get any of the niceness unless you design your language around it.<p>I don&#x27;t care about syntax either. It don&#x27;t think it really matters and it takes all of an evening to get used to syntax from any language.<p>Yeah, `this` is freakin&#x27; ridiculous.",1398572981

It becomes much harder for a human to interpret what types are actually implemented.<p>- More importantly, it severely limits the tooling available since the compiler has a lot less knowledge about the types you are dealing with. Automatic refactorings are all but impossible with structural typing.<p>Overall, I really don&#x27;t see the harm in saying explicitly &quot;My type is called Account and it implements Serializable and Entity&quot; as opposed to me having to guess by reading all its methods and also having to remember which methods are necessary to be an Entity or a Serializable.",1398571594

I&#x27;ve never liked the taste of most alcohol, so when I drink, it&#x27;s generally just a lot of shots to get it down easiest. When I went out more, I drank more (the incredible effort I have to maintain to be around people is lessened if I&#x27;m drinking). As I got older, it seemed easier to just stop leaving my apartment, and I was never a fan of drinking at home.<p>I suppose somewhere in the back of my head I always worried about becoming an alcoholic (coming from a long line of stinking drunks), but thankfully, I don&#x27;t really have any addiction issues.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that it&#x27;s probably a bad thing that so much of our culture is alcohol-centric, but I don&#x27;t begrudge that other people just like drinking.",1398571518

Instead, Valve uses a system of anonymous peer reviews, conducted once a year, where employees give their opinion of everyone they work with. Every Cabal is asked to rank the people they work with. No one ranks themselves. Results are delivered anonymously, and it’s up to the individual to decide what to do with the information. One concrete change that comes out of peer reviews is compensation adjustments. Valve goes out of its way to pay its people what they deserve, according to “who’s providing the most value at the company.”<p><a href=""http://www.forevergeek.com/2012/04/10-things-learned-from-valves-employee-handbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forevergeek.com/2012/04/10-things-learned-from-va...</a>",1398571244

You have to drink like a dozen beers to hit that, even if they&#x27;re fancy craft beers. If you&#x27;re really spending $100 on drinking, the issue is something other than drinking <i>per se</i> (either very expensive tastes in drinks, or binge drinking).<p>#4, &quot;You slow down, you slur, you say dumb shit&quot;: If you drink <i>a lot</i>, sure, but most people do not slur their speech or act noticeably different after one or two beers.<p>#5: explicitly about &quot;getting drunk&quot;, not about drinking alcohol in moderation<p>#7: drinking alcohol in moderation has generally been shown to be healthy, not unhealthy.<p>#8: &quot;The day after is not worth it&quot;. Again, this only applies to binge-drinkers, not normal drinkers. You do not get a hangover from moderate alcohol consumption.<p>#9: &quot;It turns some people into monsters&quot;, also something that only applies to excessive drinking. Having major personality changes from one or two drinks (vs. 6+) is quite rare.<p>My impression is that what the author really wants to explain is why he no longer engages in dozen-drink outings at a club, that result in a drunken stupor, large monetary expenditures, possibly unpleasant or regrettable social interactions, and day-or-more recovery. But most people who drink alcohol do not engage in that specific kind of drinking.",1398571209

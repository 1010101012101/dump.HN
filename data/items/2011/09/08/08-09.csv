2973159,comment,2972958,2973012,7,0,exDM69,,,"Out of curiosity, I checked out how the open syscall in linux works (see fs/open.c). It uses getname (from fs/namei.h), which effectively copies the filename from userland memory to a chunk of kernel memory. It uses strncpy_from_user to do this and uses PATH_MAX as the maximum length. So even the linux kernel does rely on the fact that there is a null terminator in the string.<p>So your assumption on omitting the null terminator is wrong, BUT there's another flaw in this. The length of the string can be less than four bytes. By allocating the string in a nice page boundary this can be used to cause a memory protection fault.",1315472327

They do manage to name one, but that one turns out to not be very important.<p>So, what are some examples? You write, ""They decide that you are an elite engineer primarily based on whether you went to an elite school."" The problem is it's pretty subjective what counts as an 'elite' school. It could just mean that, on average, Google hires from more prestigious universities, but this doesn't really prove elitism since it's likely they hire folks from many other universities as well.<p>Here's an example of a difference between the two companies that I think does serve the OP's point: Amazon is a toolmaker. This is mentioned, but the OP fails to really explain <i>why</i> this property really serves to make Amazon a more interesting company.<p>Overall, there are some pretty broad claims about the two companies in this post, and I'm not seeing a strong argument for why we should think Google is in 'catchup' mode as the OP claims.

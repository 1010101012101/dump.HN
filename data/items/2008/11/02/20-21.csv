My partners and I were looking for a product to build around that time when we were approached by another business savvy startup that needed a strong development team. We immediately started working together and now have our first version of the product rolling out to select Hooters restaurants tomorrow. If we had not gone to SXSW we would have never run into this other group of guys and stumbled into a really, really strong product with an amazing business model.",1225659412

By the time the next boom starts, the improvements have become best practices and carry over. There are so many things we take for granted now that were once breakthough cost-cutting measures. A good example is the move to commodity hardware, which was the result of the previous bust.

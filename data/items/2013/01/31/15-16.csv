In any given case the data hosts don't even necessarily know they exist, much less the content of the links or whether they're licensed. They have no better ability than the copyright holders themselves to discover the links and a far, far worse ability to know which links the copyright holder has licensed, which is why we put it to the copyright holders to identify them.<p>Meanwhile the link sites are extremely lightweight. You don't need a CDN with regional caching or any of that, you can host the whole thing from a single location for the whole world. So shutting down the link sites is whack a mole. Shutter one and a different one will be up and running in less than a day.<p>Again, it's an <i>economic</i> problem. It's not about the structure of these entities or who knows what. Changing the laws might move around the pieces on the board but it doesn't change the nature of the game. It doesn't change the fact that it costs millions of times less to send bits than to accurately filter them. You can't change economic reality so easily.<p>In theory we could put the genie back in the bottle, but that doesn't mean ""shut down The Pirate Bay and mega-search.me,"" it means ""shut down the Internet and stop having computers."" Because computers are what create the underlying economic conditions that lead to the issue. And I have to hope that nobody is seriously suggesting that would be an acceptable trade off.<p>I am not one of these people who thinks we should get rid of copyright. But you can read the Das Capital as a mostly accurate criticism of the failings of capitalism without accepting Marx's conclusion that communism is preferable. The facts on the ground have changed. Copyright has to change to adapt. ""Change"" doesn't have to mean ""abolish"" but it certainly means that trying to change the modern world to fit copyright is a stupid idea when we can far more sensibly change copyright to fit the modern world.",1359647935

And it's clear, especially from the mixed feelings in these comments.<p>People come in all breeds, and I know that some people absolutely cannot get work done unless they are around others working, whereas others need quiet and the comfort of their own home to be the most productive.<p>What it comes down to is if you want to hire remote, you need to make sure that your talent is self-motivated enough to do their best work at home (or wherever). If you require an office, make sure the culture fits, otherwise you'll have employees constantly distracted and grudgingly coming into the office every day.<p>You can have mixed teams, and it doesn't even matter the ratio. I've been on extremely successful teams where only two of the 30+ engineers were remote, and they did their best work remotely.

5145422,comment,5143839,5144499,1,0,foobarqux,,,"CBT seems to be based on the idea that ""wrong thought"" breeds negative emotions. For example ""I always screw up"" should be replaced with ""I screwed up this time"". But if something like ""I screw up on X most of the time"" or ""I am in the bottom percentile for X"" are statements that may occur to an analytical person that are objectively true and may directly cause negative emotions. My understanding of CBT is that it suggests replacing these thoughts with positive forms like ""sometimes I succeed at X"" and ""I'm better than most people at Y"" (even if Y is something neither you nor anyone else cares about).<p>So CBT is fine if your thoughts do not reflect reality but if they seem to encourage self-delusion. And maybe that's fine, after all what else is there than perception. But many intelligent analytical people simply cannot willfully deceive themselves.",1359646709

5145420,comment,5143839,5143839,2,0,dr_,,,"Part of the problem is how doctors, and especially psychiatrists, have approached treating depression. \nThere are many people who simply get down once in a while, in response to a particular event or series of events, the way most of us do at some point in our lives. If these people come across a psychiatrist, there's a decent chance they will end up on anti depressants when they likely just need some counseling and time. They should not be classified as depressed, maybe a transient mood disorder, but who knows if insurance would pay for that. \nThat takes away from people who truly suffer from clinical depression, a real medical condition which should be separately classified as such. If you throw them into the basket of people who are just down once in a while, you do them a great disservice, because society then looks at them as someone who just can't deal with issues and need a crutch in the form of medications. The people with real clinical depression are the ones who are at risk of committing suicide. Psychiatrists can figure out which is which usually, not always, but instead they treat everyone the same, and as a result less time is spent on those who need it the most (unless they end up getting hospitalized)",1359646678

I feel more productive when working by myself, but I know that personal perceptions of productivity can be false. Measuring personal vs team/company productivity becomes hard in anything less than the short term)<p>* That co-location is always the best solution (it isn't - other factors like team location and skills come into play)<p>What I am saying is that there is a lot of research showing that co-located teams in team-room like settings are much more productive.

A distance of 100 feet may be no better than several miles (Allen 1977). A field study of radically collocated software development teams,[...], showed significantly higher productivity and satisfaction than industry benchmarks and past projects within the firm (Teasley et al., 2002).

Besides performing your regular tasks, you have to deal with all the self-support stuff yourself, including avoiding your work stepping over your personal life, which is even worse if you work at home. It takes some practice to do that properly, to say the least.<p>I think that's where most people trying to work remotely utterly fail. They think they should be able to work anytime, when others will likely want to talk to them in normal hours. They think they don't need an schedule, when the only thing that would allow them to do their work is at least a self-imposed one. You won't be able to cook your meal and do your work at the same time, trust me. Lastly, if you lack self-discipline, remote working isn't for you.<p>The other side of the coin is even sadder: it's not that companies are not ""open"" to remote work, is that they just don't know how to manage it. They usually play their silly manager techniques by the book, which are for on-site teams (and often don't work, anyway). They just can't handle remote work. A clever manager capable of that is more scarce and expensive, also.<p>Hiring/Recruiters have the worst of both worlds, plus one thing that drives me nuts: regular hiring doesn't work for science and technology. If your task is looking for a ""Python developer"" and you think that it involves training some snakes, you're out of your element. If you're not capable to understand at least the basics of what you're looking for, you won't find it, and even worse, you won't understand what ""training snakes remotely"" means.<p>In the end, combination of all those things hurt remote working for everyone: people who doesn't (and doesn't want to) know how to do it, companies that doesn't know how to handle it (and they try with their archaic means, failing completely), and the guys in the middle that just want to score another commission for a hire of dubious quality.<p>Sorry, it ended up being longer that the rant itself.<p>(Disclosure: I've been working remotely for a few years, and I wouldn't change that for anything else.

I share this opinion and hire accordingly.<p>I think the ""these companies are wrong"" posts, though, are not attempting to see it from the other side.<p>Try to put yourself in the shoes of these startups. In super-super early startups (e.g. pre-profitability or definitely pre-revenue) one of the goals (aside from staying afloat) is to build a sustainable <i>culture</i> (company etc.). It's very difficult to build a company culture AND product AND hit profitability AND 1,000 other things from scratch before going out of business.<p>When most are co-located and a few are distributed it just adds one more thing to the pile. I've done it before, so I know how hard it is, even when we were all 'on board' with it.<p>It's just harder; you need to start from scratch with the assumption that any one can be remote at any time, and so you build your tools/processes accordingly (if you have a physical kanban board then it'll be a real hard thing to support remote devs).<p>For <i>just one</i> non-top 1% of all software-developer persons? The overhead is probably not worth it if you have a ready talent pool in your city (especially if you now have nexus in another state, which is a very real risk as states are looking to increase their revenue. ugh).<p>For Joe Average, or Jane Above Average, these companies would <i>prefer</i> to hire a local person than remote. That makes sense to me.<p>As a big part of getting from 'startup' to 'sustainable business' involves managing risk. So, understand where most of these businesses are coming from. Having one or two remote people in a company full of on-site people is a risk (not from a technical perspective, but from a culture and focus one), and not one they're willing to take.<p>It's a trade-off, and one that can make sense if viewed in context and done for the right reasons (note: ""We can't control them/see their work/trust them/need to see their faces/need them from 9-5/etc."" are WRONG REASONS).<p>Ranting about a system problem isn't very useful; I'd like to see more posts about how to convert a primarily on-site team to support 'work anywhere'.

If you're new to programming, you should just hack around.<p>The other option is to read a Design Patterns book and treat it like religion. This is what happens to many new programmers who start with C++ or Java. You learn the patterns and you apply them everywhere, because that's what you were told to do. Some people like this, but many are turned off right away. I understand the point of things like Java. They make it possible for dozens of programmers to collaborate on a large project without stepping on each other's toes. But all of that abstraction makes no sense to a new programmer (at least one who is not a super intelligent space alien).<p>I don't see that risk in other programming paradigms, mostly because they are not as popular.

I find that working remotely really agrees with my personality and work style.

By giving a false sense of privacy it actually makes the problem <i>worse</i>.<p>Privacy laws should be about protecting privacy in general, not about a specific technology like cookies. There are plenty of genuine applications of cookies (keeping you logged in to HN for example), and there are plenty of ways for Facebook to track you without using cookies that they would happily switch to if this law applied to them (but note that those methods cannot be used to keep you logged in to HN because they are not secure so that might give somebody else access to your account -- but Facebook doesn't care about 100% reliability for tracking purposes, 99% is enough).",1359644732

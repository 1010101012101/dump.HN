It had all of the little usability details nailed on its first attempt. Even those of us who didn&#x27;t appreciate its use case (myself included) couldn&#x27;t help but feel jealous of the technical ability of its creators. The founders weren&#x27;t random &quot;immature assholes,&quot; and one would hope that the investors weren&#x27;t either. A lot of people were chasing those guys with money, and they all knew what they were getting into. I wish people would spend less time obsessing over the money and more time figuring out why the company (and the two cofounders) fell apart; that&#x27;s far more useful to learn/discuss. Hating on people just because they got a couple mil is pretty stupid and childish, especially when they are clearly more technically talented than their critics.<p>If there is a bubble in this industry, it is a bubble of amateurs; people who shouldn&#x27;t be investing or working in a field that is driven by extremes, and always has been. Extreme people chasing extreme success at extreme odds. And you know, everything in those extremes is going to look weird to people on the outside. Young Gates also wrecked sports cars and nearly went to jail; maybe these are all anecdotal, but the fact remains that you&#x27;ve got to accept a bit of eccentricity in this industry, if you want eccentric returns.<p>If this whole Secret backlash thing continues, the kids in this industry might need a history lesson on why Peter Thiel called his VC firm the Founders Fund, and why it was so novel at the time. Investors always want to give founders a tough time; until Thiel and Co. came along, Valley VCs practically colluded to ensure that young entrepreneurs remained poor until an exit. I&#x27;m sure they would love for that era to return, but thankfully there&#x27;s just too much capital for such a thing to happen anytime soon.",1430880578

An application engine, which is a fancy term for &quot;database wrapper script&quot;. Much of this can be dispensed with if you build a largely static site, though access control and some scripted / scheduled events are likely still necessary. This talks to ...<p>2. A data tier.

That is, whatever kit you&#x27;re running pumps data out to a distributed caching framework (think DNS or bittorrent). If a request cannot be met from cache, or it&#x27;s expired, then your origin gets a request. But if it <i>can</i> be, you&#x27;re serving content without actually taking the hit. And if the caching is demand-responsive, then you actually have the situation where you get <i>better</i> at serving data the more requests there are. A DDoS would simply result in more caching peers feeding your data.<p>You also get the benefit that should your residential (or colo) link go down your cached data remain accessible online.<p>Law of large numbers says that any given user is going to have relatively little traffic, but when the vast searchlight of the Internet Hive Mind takes an interest in you, you&#x27;re swamped.

9496279,comment,9495493,9495493,0,0,peter-fogg,,,"OK, let&#x27;s talk about parsing.<p>The article claims that parsing isn&#x27;t necessary with structured editing. We&#x27;re working on some abstract data structure representing our language&#x27;s syntax. This might be an AST, like any programming language in common use today, or maybe in the future we&#x27;ve thought up some better way to represent programming languages within the compiler/interpreter. Since we&#x27;re working directly with the AST or whatever, we don&#x27;t need to parse! We just do whatever actions the programmer wants do over on our data structure.<p>Now, let&#x27;s talk about how parsing works in your language of choice in 2015. We&#x27;re going to take a string, and we&#x27;ll turn it into a representation of our program. If we&#x27;re lucky, our language implementation isn&#x27;t awful, and our parser will be a function from some sort of Unicode-encoded text into an AST. OK, maybe our input is ASCII or some other text encoding, but the point is the same. Either way, we&#x27;re taking some keypresses from the programmer, and turning them into a data structure representing the program.<p>Let&#x27;s abstract a bit. Maybe in the future we don&#x27;t use keyboards. Instead, we have whatever peripheral you like. This peripheral is capable of sensing some sort of action from the user, and turning it into actions within the computer. So now, our parser is a function from some user action to a data structure representing the program.<p>This sounds an awful lot like &quot;we just do whatever actions the programmer wants do over on our data structure&quot;. The question is, how do we figure out what the user wants? The answer is, we parse it! It doesn&#x27;t matter if we&#x27;re parsing text or not. We will <i>always</i> need some way of determining the programmer&#x27;s intention from the signals we get through their peripheral device. Viewed through this lens, the camera requires a parser just as much as the keyboard does, just as much as the mousepad does, just as much as the microphone does. We will <i>always</i> need a way to convert the unstructured thoughts of a human programmer into the formal language of a compiler&#x27;s internals. Regardless of what representation we choose for any part of this process, it&#x27;s going to be subject to the article&#x27;s quote:<p>>    This situation is a recipe for disaster. The parser often has bugs: it fails to handle some inputs according to the documented interface. The quoter often has bugs: it produces outputs that do not have the right meaning. Only on rare joyous occasions does it happen that the parser and the quoter both misinterpret the interface in the same way.",1430879229

Companies should value their employees for more than just their skills and experience. We believe that the best employees are motivated by a mission and values that they can relate to. By cultivating a hiring process that prioritizes culture, companies strengthen their most valuable asset: human capital. Pomello measures company culture team-by-team, and provides predictive analytics to companies on the best candidates for their unique culture. Pomello is YC-backed and funded by NEA.<p>THE ROLE
You have experience engineering enterprise applications, and you are ready to build a product from the ground up without the bureaucracy of a large company. You will take the technical lead on Pomello. Initially, you will be a full-stack engineer with a lot of hands-on building. As we grow we anticipate you will take on more team-building responsibilities. You will influence every aspect of the product from ideation to execution. We value team members who are able to make strategic decisions quickly balancing development speed with risk. We are looking for consistent progress towards long-term goals, and the ability to get comfortable with rapidly changing priorities.

9496221,comment,9495925,9496083,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> The first reason is that you want he founders to be focused on the company, and not struggling to make ends meet. That way they can make long term decisions.<p>If a company makes it beyond the seed stage, it should be capitalized well enough to allow the founders to take a reasonable salary. If there are any founders employed at venture-backed startups struggling to make ends meet, I think it&#x27;s safe to say the vast majority of them are not struggling because they&#x27;re not being paid well enough.<p>> Secondly, every round the founders lose more and more control. They should be compensated for this.<p>Why? If you want to maximize control, build a business that doesn&#x27;t need to sell equity to raise capital. Or build such a great business that you can raise large sums of capital without having to sell much equity.<p>Incidentally, when founders cash out their shares, they&#x27;re only hastening the loss of control, especially if this is done early when the company&#x27;s valuation is lower.<p>> One of the big problems with venture capital these days (and the reason I won&#x27;t take it anymore) is that it disrespects the founders by demanding liquidation preferences for the VCs. As if the VCs who merely put up other people&#x27;s money should have rights superior to the people who literally put part of their life into the company. That&#x27;s not right. All shares should be equal, and if not, the founders should at least be respected.<p>This is silly. You&#x27;re not going to raise millions of dollars from professional investors who have fiduciary duties to their limited partners without said investors demanding reasonable protections. Period.<p>If a founder is worried about a 1x preference, which is fairly standard, it suggests the founder is not confident about the company&#x27;s prospects, at least as far as investor expectations are concerned. For example, if a founder raises $5 million round at $15 million pre and is worried about a 1x preference, one would have to question whether the founder really believes the company is actually going to be able to deliver the type of growth his or her investors expect.<p>If an investor demands a 2x or greater preference in this market, it probably means the company is not in a good position because nobody competing for a deal is likely to demand more than a 1x preference today.<p>> Thirdly, too often I&#x27;ve seen VCs force founders to revest shares. But the value of those shares was already earned. The founder incentive to do well comes from increasing the value of the shares... and revesting the shares denies the founders crucial voting rights that they have earned already. (And makes it that much easier for the VCs to force a founder out, which is usually a bad idea in my experience.)<p>Revesting is negotiable and if you set up a reasonable vesting schedule when you form your company, chances are you&#x27;ll be able to avoid this issue entirely. A lot of founder revesting issues arise because the founders purchased their shares for virtually nothing with no restrictions attached when they formed the company.",1430878192

That feeling of complexity, in my opinion, would leave investors feeling that the whole solution was so complex that there were too many ways to fail. Manufacturing? Marketplace? Hardware? It&#x27;s too much for me - I can&#x27;t imagine how an investor takes it all in and feels that the team could successfully execute on all the parts.<p>The best decks I&#x27;ve seen, in addition to everything you&#x27;ve brought up, also simplify the idea down.",1430877798
9496194,comment,9494310,9495946,0,0,hzhou321,,,"Thanks.<p>MyDef is not really a programming language, but a meta layer. Sounds like a new concept but it is more like cpp or m4 in the toolchain point of view. As such, it can work with any programming languages. e.g. In the Nim example, every thing written is Nim, except the macro; and MyDef itself is actually in 100% Perl (the bootstrap folder is actually a pure Perl package). However, specific extension/plugin also can be written for specific language to customize and gain special power; I did that for Perl and C.",1430877786
9496193,comment,9490723,9493435,0,0,ahomescu1,,,"> I had a friend interview with Google to work in their uptime group or something like that. He had to solve some brainteaser about generating an in-order list of numbers that meet a certain criteria in O(n) time and constant space. I get that someone somewhere thought it was a good idea. But if you&#x27;re tasked with keeping failures from happening being able to solve that brainteaser doesn&#x27;t say anything about your suitability for the job. Being able to imagine disaster scenarios and how they&#x27;ll play out seems a lot more important to me.<p>I think Google&#x27;s approach to hiring has generally been &quot;let&#x27;s hire really smart and overqualified people and then they&#x27;ll be suitable for any job&quot;.",1430877767

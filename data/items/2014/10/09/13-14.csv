Maybe not 5%, but it realistically wouldn&#x27;t take more for me to bail. 10% is almost a guarantee that I&#x27;ll work for you.<p>I think this shows just how significant the gap is between software engineering and everything else. I went into mechanical engineering; my brother did software engineering. I don&#x27;t know the specifics, but he makes way more than I do. Not 20% more, but <i>200%</i> more. Some of that is location - I live in the middle of the country, he lives in California.

You can create your own gestureset that can run on multiple platforms with an online editor and recorder app, gestures run on top of the app as a transparent no-intrusive overlay.<p>Integrating into your apps very easily, as ever seen, and does not interfere with the current components and work flow, reducing about 80% the development process.",1412862487

There are several options: create a new and unencumbered license, negotiate a license for an existing system, or purchase the patent right from the patent holder.<p>The final choice depends on the cost to develop a new codec, the success of that codec, and the cost of buying or licensing the patent(s). The government can explore all of these at the same time, eg, set up a group to develop a new codec while negotiating with various rights-holders.<p>The new codec might be finished while the negotiating is ongoing. The government knows how well it fits their goals, but the rights-holders do not. This gives a negotiation advantage to the government.<p>On the other hand, if the completed codec were immediately published, that advantage disappears. The rights-holders might decide to raise their prices after seeing just how bad the new codec is, which makes the government goal of more open access to their video archives more expensive.<p>Thus, the government could rightly &quot;judge the public interest not to be served by publishing [their] own software&quot;, even if, after the negotiations have completed, the software will be published.",1412862473

So holding money supply constant (which is of course ridiculous), we&#x27;d expect more inflation in the BI scenario than the no BI scenario.<p>Yes, I agree that it seems like there would be more inflation with BI than without it, though, as I said, that will be irrelevant in policy terms as long as the inflation doesn&#x27;t exceed the BI cash injection. Presumably the level of BI would be tailored to compensate for projected inflation.<p>> The real question here, which is more or less unrelated to inflation: why do we want to shift resources from investment to consumption? Do we have a high discount rate and basically not care about the future?<p>I think the answer to this question comes from the fact that BI is a policy designed to alter the distribution of wealth, rather than the overall level of wealth.

Then, next time I open the messaging app to text my mother, or open the email app to email her, or when the phone&#x27;s GPS realizes I&#x27;m over at her house, Cortana will show that reminder[3].<p>It also works for location-based reminders: &quot;Next time I&#x27;m at the hardware store, remind me to buy softener salt&quot;. It&#x27;s been about six months since I&#x27;ve last used Android, but I don&#x27;t think Google Now could do these types of reminders when I switched.<p>[1].

I kind of agree with this.<p>Then he goes on to caracterize games by their capabiblity of being played withour roleplaying. By this logic, he then says that not only World of Warcraft is not a roleplaying game, but Dungeons and Dragons isn&#x27;t one either.<p>This is followed by \n&quot;You can play board games such as Rex and Battlestar Galactica and even Settlers of Catan without roleplaying… but roleplaying seems to make them more enjoyable. [...] but if you go too far in that direction, you’ll lose. And the goal of those games is to win. Roleplaying, in the end, sabotages the goal of the game.&quot;<p>&quot;...try playing games such as Vampire or Pendragon or Our Last Best Hope or World of Dew or Deadlands without roleplaying, you’re missing the entire point of the game.&quot;<p>This, in internet lingo, is what is called &quot;BadWrongFun&quot;, i.e. you can&#x27;t have fun playing a game in a way different than the intended by the authors.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is such a thing as &quot;BadWrongFun&quot;. I have this ruleset, I should be allowed to do with it whatever I want. I can roleplay in chess. I can call my knight Tim and have him be the queen&#x27;s brother. And when he is captured, the grieving queen only moves half the distance. And I can also have a highly tactical dungeon crawl in (let&#x27;s pick a narrative focused roleplaying game) FATE, completely ignoring setting, theme and story, throwing challenge after challenge at the players. Both of these are OK, and many more.<p>IMO, the problem with the authors logic is the idea of the objective or point of the game. That when you play Chess you want to win, when you play WoW you want to level up, and when you play a roleplaying game you want to craft and experience a story. I&#x27;ll refute this with an example:<p>The &quot;point&quot; of the car is to help people move around and carry goods. But there are people who like to race cars. There are people who like to tune them and modify them. And some like to collect them. Because what people do with something doesn&#x27;t always match its purpose.<p>Therefore, there is nothing wrong with roleplaying chess, or being a min-maxer[2] in a roleplaying game. People can do whatever they want with their games. Losing in chess is not bad if the player didn&#x27;t care for winning or losing in the first place.<p>To finish my rant, here&#x27;s my last thought: All games need balance, some more than others. But the balance required for a game depends on the context of the gaming session and the players goals for that gaming session.<p>[1] And I&#x27;d reiterate it as &quot;some games need more balance than others&quot;\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-maxing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-maxing</a>",1412861126

The billpay system leverages the fact that most payments for most folks go to companies, and those are all electronic links; the checks are somewhat rarer in the big picture and only to small businesses or people.  The checks in this case are not &quot;certified&quot; in that they are not a guaranteed transfer; like any other check, they can bounce.  But yes, they are printed and mailed, and there is a cost to that vs. the electronic thing.<p>The wire, however, including the account (the routing number can be looked up by your bank; it just saves time if you already have it) is a very specific approach to transferring money in a certified manner.  It&#x27;s older, and has some overhead and history in how it&#x27;s tracked and managed, if for no other reason than that the funds are guaranteed.   As such, there are still fees on it (and that&#x27;s probably true in most countries, btw, unless you have a balance over a certain amount).<p>Most folks paying their babysitter $40 aren&#x27;t concerned about a certified transfer, and assume they will have funds to cover the check when cashed, so they don&#x27;t need to pay any fees and will just do a regular &quot;check&quot;.  And I would bet that the banks are working on ways to do a better job of making electronic links to reduce their need to print those checks (for example, perhaps if I keep paying my babysitter 2 or more times, the bank could automatically check the clearning house for the deposited check, and, in the future, autonegotiate a direct link with the babysitters bank and account for payment or something clever like that; I don&#x27;t know if that would really work but sounds cool).",1412859952

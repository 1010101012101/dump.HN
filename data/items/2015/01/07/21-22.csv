I guess it depends on what you compare it to, or if you have low performance standards in general. I run offlineimap + mutt for my email, and all mail related operations are near-instant (~10-20ms). Gmail often takes more than a second to switch between my folders/filters. That makes it about 100 times slower than my solution. And my solution runs on my 3 year old laptop. Not to mention the hundreds of megabytes wasted in showing a webpage in a browser that could be put to good use caching things that I actually care about.<p>That aside, whats the &quot;hack&quot; here? How to send email using an SMTP server?",1420667999

8853586,comment,8853308,8853461,0,0,phillc73,,,"Exactly. I thought this article dealed with a very specific problem in a very specific geographic region.<p><i>I’m talking about the issue of “zero rating”: the practice being followed by mobile carriers around the world to provide Web access “for free” to their users to certain chosen services. </i><p><i>But all other OECD countries have some flavor of zero rating in place.</i><p>I&#x27;ve never heard of a UK or European carrier implementing &quot;zero rating&quot; services, so I&#x27;m not sure how far around the world this occurs and the only concrete examples given are in the US.<p>I&#x27;m with a dinky little PAYG plan in Austria at the moment, and I just pay EUR3.95 for 1GB as I need it, which I never seem to use very fast because the majority of the time I&#x27;m connected via WiFi. Even when I was moving house in the UK and tethered my phone, I think I only used about 6GB in the course of a month. Of course I was slightly careful with video streaming and other data heavy activities, but I didn&#x27;t really restrict my Internet use.<p>Anyway, my point is, &quot;zero rating&quot; even if it did occur would have very little relevance when data is so cheap anyway. It seems to me that the root of the problem is overpriced data, and not the &quot;zero rating&quot; of some services.<p>Edit: As for voice and text. I use Telegram for all my heavy &quot;texting&quot; and a SIP provider for all calls. I think my total monthly mobile telephony bill is only about EUR10 with the Austrian PAYG plan and another $10 with the SIP provider.<p>I used to have massive mobile phone bills, sometimes in excess of £100 per month (average around £70), when I lived in the UK and traveled around Europe a lot. This was all down to charges while abroad, and apart from not accept incoming calls, there wasn&#x27;t a lot I could do about it if I wanted to continue operating my business.",1420667924

The reason is that they are resolved at runtime (via so-called &quot;selectors&quot;). In fact, Objective-C doesn&#x27;t technically call methods but they use a message passing system.

Whatsapp is killing it because they broke out of the mold.

8853580,comment,8851902,8851902,0,0,javajosh,,,"I find this all exceedingly strange - why should we care about a teenager&#x27;s opinions, right or wrong? Kids don&#x27;t make money, and they spend relatively small amounts of parent/student-loan money. Moreover, all signs point to a difficult job market for new graduates, kids moving back home for extended periods, etc, so the argument that they will <i>soon</i> spend money doesn&#x27;t resonate. Why then is this demographic so coveted? Heck why do these kids have smartphones at all?<p>I begin to suspect that youth-obsessed culture is actually a temporary phenomena. The reason it happened in the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s was that this was the dawn of the consumer internet, and college kids were the first adopters (a fact that is itself a confluence of educational theory and the enthusiasm/capability of computer science academics)<p>Against this, we could say that college kids are a better demo for this stuff because they are so <i>pure</i>, in the sense that they aren&#x27;t constrained by jobs or other income production - so they are at a magical junction between <i>articulate</i> and <i>irresponsible</i>, like having a society of our own &quot;id&quot;s running around. If we can please them in their primordial state, then surely that will have resonance in the hearts of the middle-aged who&#x27;s youthful lusts still exist under rocky layers of life&#x27;s harsh requirements.",1420667868

Both happen to be areas where youth culture has historically served a role as early adopters.

Distributing code derived in this manner is pretty clearly copyright infringement unless the original license allows it. I am not a lawyer, but I would argue that, while reverse engineering to allow interoperability is acceptable, doing so by purely copying the original is not, and performing mechanical transformations on the code (disassembly/recompilation) is not enough to cause the resulting code to be a non-derived work.<p>That said, I can see how this is a technologically reasonable first step toward a new implementation.

People often invite all their friends which includes everyone they have ever met, people that don&#x27;t even live in the area or that they are close with anymore. Facebook gives you no intelligence whatsoever on the events, like &quot;here are people you always invite&quot; or &quot;here are people you always invite but who never respond&quot; etc, which would be easy to show and very helpful. There is no way to update people coming to the event on changes or anything other than posting on the event&#x27;s wall, which most people will not be notified of unless they check facebook all the time, etc. etc. I could go on for so long about how shitty facebook events are, and it truly makes me sad, because really the purpose of these events is just to meet up with and have fun with friends, but the process is so frustrating I feel like it actually prevents this from happening in a lot of cases.<p>On that note, I am also very passively plotting out working on a better version, so if anyone is reading this and is also frustrated by facebook&#x27;s crap events feel free to get in touch, hah.",1420667469

Any tight loop will fit in it just fine, and it&#x27;s hardly like you&#x27;re thrashing the cache often at all (except, again in cases where you would already be thrashing the cache on CISC). It&#x27;s very difficult to find a scenario where RISC is held back by the instruction cache where CISC would not be. Obviously, if you shrink the cache and use -Os and try not to duplicate code, you could probably run into this scenario more often, but it&#x27;s just not a very relevant argument. See: why people don&#x27;t bother to use thumb instructions on ARM. It&#x27;s very rarely the bottleneck for a chunk of code. In fact, the only place I&#x27;d expect to see it make a difference is either a) with dynamic translation, ala Qemu, where you might rapidly thrash a lot of code pages, and b) on application load on heavily duplicated code (again, think C++).<p>In fact, I&#x27;d argue that the RISC vs CISC argument is less relevant than ever these days:<p>+ Compilers hide more assembly than ever, removing the need for human readability of underlying instructions.<p>+ Memory bandwidth and branch prediction are both larger issue on both architectures than decoding of instructions.<p>+ Intel has shown low-power CISC processors are in fact viable (atom and celeron are both respectable), although it looks difficult to get a risc-like performance/watt out of them.<p>+ Most modern cisc code translates VERY CLEANLY to a risc-like microcode. Assuming the translation cache is hot, translation really shouldn&#x27;t add much overhead.<p>No, I think the major downsides of CISC are maintainability (both in terms of ISA and actually laying down logic) and in the difficulty of correct implementation semantics across diverse implementations, something I&#x27;m frankly amazed at Intel&#x27;s ability to reliably pull off.",1420666359

Bacteria are typically pretty slow relative to industrial chemical processes and their speed can vary immensely depending on a lot of variables. This is by far the largest reason why more people don&#x27;t use bacteria to produce chemicals.<p>2. Bacteria take a lot of metabolic genetic engineering to do what you want them to do reliably, and can lose traits they are engineered for relatively easily due to natural selection against energetically inefficient (read: productive in this capacity) mutants.<p>3. Any chemicals derived from bacteria still need to be isolated, combined, and purified in an industrial fashion before they are actually useful.<p>4. Valuable chemicals which are extremely expensive to produce with traditional industrial methods (in particular, certain chiral molecules) can probably be produced more cheaply with a properly engineered bacteria.<p>As you can see, there are a lot of drawbacks, but #4 can be a colossal economic advantage for certain chemicals. In particular, recent FDA regulations have mandated uniformity amongst drug-grade chemicals, meaning that they must be purified in order to only contain one isomeric form rather than a mix. This is important because the different isomers of the same chemical may have different biological effects.<p>Isolating stereoisomers from each other is traditionally extremely expensive and slow, but a bacteria that could reliably produce the desired isomer would avoid this pitfall.",1420666124

I&#x27;ve read the theory in a few places, that Sony and the media were demanding answers, and so the administration gave them one. Conveniently, I guess, it is one that they assumed would not be believed whether they denied it or not (because who believes anything said by the North Korean government?).<p>I just don&#x27;t know that Sony and the media industry carries so much weight that they can actually sway our government to make shit up. And, was a pleasant fiction even what they actually wanted? I guess George Clooney wanted it. And, I guess Sony wanted to be able to say, &quot;See, it was a nation-state that did this terrible thing, not our horrendous security practices.&quot;<p>So, maybe it is this simple. And, others have mentioned reasonable theories about what the administration could get out of it being North Korea: Concessions from NK allies, the ability to ratchet up cybersecurity expenditures (as another arm of the military industrial complex), and redirection of attention from other issues. If the latter was the goal, it has certainly been effective. We&#x27;re all talking about it, and many of us don&#x27;t even believe them. So, it might not even matter if we believe the story, as long as we&#x27;re not paying attention to whatever else they&#x27;re up to.<p>I gotta get a new hat.",1420665889

I remain sceptical: Comey and especially Clapper aren&#x27;t exactly what I&#x27;d call reliable sources. But they seem to have made their minds up, and that argument just goes round in circles.

One reason is that I <i>know</i> this evidence absolutely can be faked: one particularly good tool to fake it is called QUANTUMSQUIRREL. They aren&#x27;t the only people who can build tools like that: doesn&#x27;t even take a high budget. And the same people who built QSQRL, have built other systems which automatically respond with high-budget malware when they think they&#x27;re being attacked.<p>I think we all know what happens in that endgame: the only winning move is not to play. But numerous countries, and non-state actors, are already playing it - if the FBI is to be believed, even psychotic despotic ones with relatively small budgets.<p>I want to get off Mr Comey&#x27;s wild ride; but how? Technically, we can build stronger network protocols, write bug-free software... every bit as hard as it sounds, but we can try our best.<p>What can we do politically? Given how incredibly dangerous this could get, perhaps a treaty banning &#x27;cyberwar&#x27; or &#x27;cyberespionage&#x27; would be a good idea. (While we&#x27;re at it, can we ban the use of &#x27;cyber&#x27;? It sounds utterly ridiculous.)

Facebook Messenger is the main way of communicating with people who have it. You also use it to communicate with people who don&#x27;t have Facebook Messenger by the indirection of using Facebook Messenger to talk to someone who might have their phone number.\nInstagram: I know a total of maybe two people that use this at all, and they have their content copying to Facebook which is where most people see it I think.\nTwitter: Not a lot of people use this, with the curious exception of the Facebook objectors, who mostly use this.\nSnapchat: I know a few people who use Snapchat but I don&#x27;t think anyone takes it seriously. Of course that&#x27;s kind of the point. General assumption is that snapchat users are trading dickpics and just not sharing with the rest of us.\nTumblr: A lot of people are tumblr users but in sort of a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; way, you don&#x27;t discuss it with people you&#x27;re trying to win the respect of. Perception is that it&#x27;s mostly [furry]porn and SJWs. Admittedly this is roughly correct.\nYik Yak: Took the campus by storm. Most people use it exclusively to either complain about faculty, ineffectively try to find a date, or to make fun of the former two. Openly mocked, but in the way that makes other people install the app just to see what&#x27;s being joked about, so I guess that&#x27;s a social strategy.\nMedium: Maybe a handful of CS majors even know what it is.<p>Yeah, I go to a small engineering school and my social group is primarily in CS. I&#x27;m sure this impacts my experience a lot. This is exactly my point: I think social media/application/etc usage is far too specific to social groups, institutions, and even geographical areas for it to be remotely useful to work off of anecdotes. Here Facebook is absolutely king, but I can imagine a &quot;trendier&quot; population (not Engineering students) might have a certain ire for it.

It&#x27;s based on a shallow look at one group of people, and behavior varies far too much between groups.

It appeared that some of the mutations that allowed this were either point or deletion mutations of that protein, either it was deranged or cut off in some location, or outright deleted (missing from the bacteria&#x27;s set of genes in its DNA).<p>So this survival mechanism is one of just not letting the antibiotic inside in the first place, which is how it appears teixobactin producing bacteria survive it.

Or was the shop owner not &quot;dishonest&quot; enough but the person who originally purchased the property and wanted it returned &quot;dishonest?&quot;<p>You evidently missed the bit where I explored the definition of dishonest.<p>For clarity, I&#x27;ll expand here.  If I go into a shop, and pose as a customer, but then run out with it in my hand without paying, then, by a colloquial definition of dishonesty, I will have &quot;dishonestly appropriated&quot; it. However the Act specifically defines &quot;dishonestly&quot; in section 2 (the relevant line is 2(1) which I erroneously wrote as 3(1).  See my comment above - &quot;So, if the owner believes that they have a right to take it, then they can&#x27;t be guilty of Theft.&quot;)<p>> Seems like you&#x27;re using a double standard here.<p>In what way? For a start, I&#x27;ve made no assertions about the criminality or innocence of the pawnbroker.  The pawnbroker may be guilty of Handling Stolen Goods, but is more likely to fall under the good faith statement in 3(2).  All I&#x27;ve stated is that the original owner is not guilty of an offence (unless by some odd mental quirk, they took it without believing that they had a right to do so).<p>> All the appropriation clause indicates is that if someone purchases property in good faith they effectively aren&#x27;t a thief under the law<p>The first clause in the section describes what is appropriation (i.e. assuming the rights of owner).  The second clause is the good-faith exception you describe.<p>> Simply bringing up the appropriations clause doesn&#x27;t prove (or disprove) that the original owner would be considered a thief since you&#x27;re misusing the law anyway.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s why, after bringing up the appropriations section, I brought up the dishonestly section, to show that the only situation in which the original owner could be a thief is if they took it without believing they had a right to do so, which would be very odd behaviour.   It&#x27;s also why I went on to explore the other two offences, of which the original owner could not be guilty either.<p>>Doesn&#x27;t apply. You cannot shoplift your own goods. Just like the hat or coat you had on when you entered the store isn&#x27;t &quot;shoplifted&quot; when you left the store wearing it.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s what I said.  &#x27;... and requires an offence under 1(1) of the Theft Act.&#x27;  In order to be considered shoplifting, it must be a theft.  Since it isn&#x27;t a theft, then it isn&#x27;t shoplifting.  I brought it up to point out that even though there&#x27;s another act that might cover this, but doesn&#x27;t, because it refers to the Theft Act for a definition, which we have already shown, does not apply.",1420665003

8853290,comment,8852487,8853232,0,0,timr,,,"What they&#x27;re describing here is an <i>intensive</i> selection process for resistance. It&#x27;s debatably much more intensive than nature would ever perform: they&#x27;re growing bacteria in the presence of various dilutions of the antibiotic, taking a sample of the culture, diluting it 100-fold, and repeating the selection many (~30) times. Then they look for any bugs that develop resistance. None were found.  Even if you had a truly pathological patient (i.e. someone who was doing his level best to mis-use an antibiotic), it wouldn&#x27;t come close to this level of selective pressure for antibiotic resistance.<p>Moreover, there&#x27;s a strong biochemical argument against resistance: the region that the antibiotic targets is highly conserved, which means that it&#x27;s probably functionally necessary. The bug is therefore unlikely to evolve away from the threat. This is important, because it&#x27;s that most likely avenue for antibiotic resistance, energetically speaking: it doesn&#x27;t cost anything for an organism to mutate a weakly conserved gene, so they do it once, and pass it on to every subsequent generation with no penalty.<p>The antibiotic is just a peptide, so <i>in theory</i> you could see some sort of specialized peptidase evolve from an existing gene...but the problem is that the bug would have to then carry around that gene and <i>express it constantly</i> (or even less likely: evolve a sensing system that allows for selective expression). It&#x27;s a highly unlikely thing, and virtually impossible to maintain over multiple generations without constant selective pressure. Bacteria do not like to hold on to genes that they don&#x27;t need.<p>Nothing is impossible over evolutionary time, of course, but the researchers don&#x27;t seem to be overstating their case here.",1420664686

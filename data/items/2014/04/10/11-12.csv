Better to go through the book skipping a few parts then to stop because you can&#x27;t do every single exercise the first time through! I just started chapter 4, and judicious skipping has thus far been the right choice.   If the options are &quot;skip a little and gain the value of the rest&quot; or &quot;try do it all, but get stuck and quit&quot; choose pragmatism!<p>Also, a trick I like to do with the exercises is struggle with one for 20 minutes or so, and if I am not making progress, look up the answer. Usually that helps me understand what I was missing enough to then do it myself. That happens maybe 1/5th of the time, and usually because the question was vague or oddly worded, or most commonly, I didn&#x27;t know how to test that it was correct.",1397131149

7565212,comment,7565094,7565184,4,0,marvin,,,"The article is pointing out a phenomenon related to interpersonal relationships, not technology. Part of interacting with other developers is nonverbal communication (or subtext) and the reactions it causes.<p>So if you are genuinely surprised, a natural reaction would of course be to display this through verbal and nonverbal reactions. But at that point (or even before, as a matter of emotional awareness), people should probably stop and think for a bit what sort of reactions they <i>want</i> to cause in other programmers.<p>Is the guy wrong (in the sense of giving the wrong impression) for calling himself an expert even though he doesn&#x27;t know some STL features of C++? Is this something that should be communicated to him? Would it have a net positive effect on your working relationship if it was? Do you feel threatened by an expert who doesn&#x27;t know this feature? Is there a possibility that <i>you</i> are wrong and that he is only missing a specific feature that you yourself have worked with but is not necessarily stanard? Is your (overt) surprise meant to evoke a certain reaction in the other developer? Would it make your working relationship easier if you hid your surprise instead of making a show of it? Etc.<p>I hope this comment doesn&#x27;t come across as condescending, but this sort of interpersonal communication is hard for a lot of programmers I know (at one point including myself). Being aware of these things can help smooth over rough points (and improve productivity, even if you are looking at the purely utilitarian perspective and ignoring general happiness).",1397128358

947974,comment,947614,947614,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I started a social news site devoted to cute cat/dog pictures and videos earlier this year.  I worked pretty hard on it for a couple of months, only to realize, that I couldn't stand looking at cute shit every day for months on end.  So, I took the site down.  I got 700 uniques in 3 months, and had 5000 page views.<p>I learned a few things along the way.  I got quite a few initial users off of Mechanical Turk.  I submitted a request asking for users to test my application out.  I paid them a nickel a piece to have users visit my site, click through a couple of links and post a comment on something cute.  I ended up paying around $1 a day, and I got some great feedback from them.  It was also fairly low pressure for me, too.  I didn't have to worry about things breaking and losing users.  The Turkers expected things to break, because I was asking them to test the site out.  I recommend trying spending $5 to 10 on the Turk.  It's really hard to go wrong.<p>I also tried advertising using adwords.  That was a mixed bag.  Initially I got a decend click through rate on my ads because the Westminster Dog show was going on, and people were interested in seeing pictures of cute dogs and cats.  So, I got a bunch of decent traffic from that for around $0.10 to 0.20 a visit.  But, as I continued advertising on adwords, I started noticing a pretty big bounce rate.  So, I cut back on adsense and focused on other channels.<p>I also spent quite a bit of time emailing bloggers who had cute blogs.  I got some traffic from them.<p>I also spent quite a bit of time posting good comments on other people's blogs.  I actually got a couple of clicks a day from people clicking through my signature link on icanhazcheezburger.com.<p>Probably my ROI was from a comment that I posted on a cute pig video on the LA Times website.  I got several good referrals a week for two months off of that single comment.<p>So, I just put up <a href=""http://newsley.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsley.com</a> which is a business/economic social news site.  Right now, I'm just talking to friends and family and getting feedback from them, so I can make changes to the app accordingly.  My next step is going to get some feedback from Mechanical Turk.  It's a cheap and easy way to elicit good feedback from users.<p>This time around, I'm going to work with twitter a lot more.  A friend of mine developed some decent twitter bot software that categorizes twitter users by value to me and handles the following/unfollowing bit while avoiding spamming people.  I think that if you can find twitter users that are interested in your niche, they could probably help out a lot.<p>I don't really know if I'm going to user adwords or not.  It ended up being pretty expensive.  My customer acquisition cost using adwords was about $1-2.<p>I'll still post comments on news stories and articles.  I can sleep at night as long as I'm not spamming the comments thread, and I feel like I'm adding something to the discussion.  Finally, I'm probably going to go out and press the flesh quite a bit more on this one.  I'll probably do a lot more meat space networking for this site.",1258530929

947957,comment,947787,947787,0,0,ezf,,,"Yes. I suspect that the incidence of ADD on this forum is much higher than average. The diagnostic criteria are not that high.<p>As far as treatment -- stimulants help absolutely everyone focus better, regardless of whether or not they have ADD. I am not exception. My personal belief is that ADD is mostly just a catch-all term for people at the lower end of the spectrum of focusing.<p>My advice as far as medication is to get Ritalin or Focalin or Concerta, not one of the amphetamine based drugs. Don't bother with the non stimulant drugs. Amphetamine (Adderall, Vyvanse, Dexedrine) is a very serious, hard drug to be taking every day and it can do odd things to your ability to experience pleasure.<p>I am prescribed twice daily short acting Ritalin 20mg, though depending on how much I want to focus I take it less often and/or in a lower dosage. If your schedule is flexible and you know you don't want to be stimulated for 12 hours at a time, then ask your psychiatrist for a short acting medication rather than one of the extended release ones.<p>Finally, you should always get mental health advice from a mental health professional. Please see a psychiatrist, not your primary care physician.",1258529558

947950,comment,947740,947740,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This sounds like one of those ""In The Year 2000"" articles from Popular Science in the '50s.  It is hyperbolic beyond credulity, probably missing some extremely important aspects of the central tenet of the story, and too light on cited facts to take seriously.<p>I do think there will be major changes in the way meat for the majority of meat eaters is produced in the future, but it won't be in three years, or even ten.  The changes <i>have</i> to happen because meat production is simply too resource intensive for an ever-growing population to keep on eating more and more of the stuff without ever increasing environmental impact.  But, they will come extremely slowly, because peoples habits change extremely slowly.  People will choose ""real"" meat for a long time after cheaper in-vitro meats are available.<p>If I ate meat, I would be somewhat suspicious of the new stuff, just as I'm suspicious of most modern, and not so modern, lab-created food additives.  As with most artificial sweeteners, HFCS, hydrogenated fats, etc., I'm suspicious of them as beacons for general poor quality when I see them on a label.  I know if the manufacturer chose the cheapest options for the sweeteners and fats, they probably chose the cheapest garbage for the rest of the ingredients, too.  Much like soy in burgers indicated to people in the '70s and '80s that it was a poor quality, cheap, food, in-vitro meats will probably go through a phase of being thought second rate.  And, of course, a few years on, we now know that soy in some forms actually can be detrimental to health, particularly in men.<p>It will take a pretty brilliant marketing coup to overcome that kind of resistance.  Splenda and Nutri-Sweet both had very effective marketing that seems to have countered any feelings of badness about them.  Though what Nutri-Sweet replaced (Saccharine) had such a bad reputation at the time that anything probably would have been a shoe-in.  It's not coincidence that Splenda began to hit big just as questions about the safety of Nutri-Sweet/Aspartame started to get mainstream attention.  I'm not sure people will be convinced about the unhealthiness of meat, since artificial meats aren't exactly mainstream today, despite many of them being quite tasty (certainly tastier than diet sodas) and reasonably healthful.  This makes me think the desire for healthier substitutes for meat isn't very high, and the awareness of most folks of the environmental impact is even lower.",1258529370
947949,comment,947541,947541,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'm showing my personal bias, of course. I just launched a business/economic social news site called <a href=""http://newsley.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsley.com</a>.<p>But, far from being parasites, social news sites expose readers to a much greater cross section of news than a local newspaper ever could.  And, a well moderated social news site like Hacker News or a heavily filtered reddit is much more useful than an editor could ever be.  There's still a whole lot of room for news aggregation/content crap filtration online.  Social News is just getting started.<p>But then, I'm probably preaching to the choir here on HN. :)",1258529176
947948,comment,947740,947740,0,0,nvasilak,,,"This scares me to death.<p>There is no way that humanity has figured out all the complexity that billions of years of evolution has created when it comes to animals eating each other.<p>Corporations are now coming up with new types of 'food' that they can sell for much more profit than the things our species have been surviving on for thousands of years. Take margarine for example - no cows to raise and milk, therefore a much bigger profit margin than butter. They also tell us it's much healthier too. But then studies like this come along <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/us/study-links-heart-disease-to-margarine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/us/study-links-heart-disea...</a> , and the whole french paradox, which indicate the opposite may be true.<p>""When In-Vitro Meat (IVM) is cheaper than meat-on-the-hoof-or-claw, no one will buy the undercut opponent."" I seriously doubt it. Even though a grass fed, dry aged steak is quite expensive, many people splurge because they are delicious. Has the author heard of the organic movement growing 20% a year over the past decade? People buying more expensive food because it's healthier and tastes better, that defies logic.<p>The article claims that this IVM is also healthier for the planet, but it neglects to mention where all the raw ingredients for the IVM will come from. Mother nature already created the perfect way to stay healthy - plants get energy from the sun to grow, animals eat plants, and excrete fertilizer to grow new plants. This happened for millions of years before humans came along. Unfortunately, our farms are no longer run using this perfect natural solution (another issue entirely), but I don't see how IVM would solve this.<p>My favorite quote from the article: ""We won't even choke to death because IVM contains no malicious bones or gristle.""  It's amazing our species has survived so long with so many malicious bones and evil gristle after us. Malicious bones - I cant stop picturing zombies, haha.",1258529172

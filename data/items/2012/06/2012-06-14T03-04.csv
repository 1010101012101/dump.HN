4109692,comment,4107993,4109213,3,0,tzs,,,"> If you can answer the question of why the Govt wants to use the drones in the first place, you have my answer to why that's a bad thing.<p>Some obvious places state and local governments will want to use drones:<p> Search and rescue. For the cost of one manned aircraft, a whole fleet of drones could be deployed, allowing for a wider search.<p> Fire monitoring. A park ranger who spots a remote fire could check it out much faster with a drone than on foot or horseback or ATV.<p> Traffic monitoring and crowd safety monitoring during high turnout events. For instance, major sporting events, or the informal large street celebrations that happen when the home team wins a championship.<p> Damage assessment after natural disasters or severe weather. A fleet of small drone helicopters could check power lines after a severe wind storm to find places where trees or branches have fallen into lines, for example.<p> After a snow storm, a school could send a drone to fly over the school bus routes to determine if they appear safe to send out the school buses, or if school needs to be cancelled.<p>So how are these bad things?",1339646355

Everything about the game just seems setup to squeeze money out of people.<p>For example, in D2 the skills you chose were a crucial component of how well you did later in the game.  You could create a build with relatively crap equipment who could do well later in the game based on their skills.  But in D3 skills don't matter and everything is based on equipment - and you can buy equipment for real money and give Blizzard a cut.<p>Also, it doesn't seem big enough.  I got my first character through normal in something like 3 days.  And then I'm repeating the same old thing.  It was 11 years between the release of D2's expansion and Diablo 3.  I know they have other games, but they could have spent a little more time making the world bigger.  My guess is they start selling service packs.  They know people will buy them, so why not?<p>I'm enjoying it, and I'll probably play one character up to 60 and try out the others, but I just can't see myself playing it like I did D2.",1339646159

The use of arbitrary indicators and qualitative characteristics as a primary decision factor for who they invest in or not would seem to be contributory to their overall poor performance. Perhaps VCs should learn to resist their early (and probably incorrect) assumptions about entrepreneurs based on age, nervousness, or other factors and instead look to the underlying premise of the business and existing capabilities of the management team. Or at least they should realize that they are not particularly good evaluators of those characteristics, based on their past performance, and factor that in accordingly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/institutional-limited-partners-must-accept-blame-for-poor-long-term-returns-from-venture-capital.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/institutional-limited-partn...</a>",1339645760

4109665,comment,4107895,4109598,5,0,notJim,,,"1. Essentially, you are correct here, in that being biased against seemingly irrelevant details seems to work just fine for VCs. That being said, a) these biases may be preventing them from making optimal decisions (instead, they're making <i>good enough</i> decisions.) and b), I hold my peers to a certain standard of ethics like not discriminating against people. I suspect that VCs do too.<p>2. You said we should give credit for the OP giving feedback, and that VCs lie because they don't like getting snarky responses. I am arguing that a) this response is deserving of a response like nirvana's because it reveals that VCs make judgments based on unquestioned biases and irrelevant details, and b) VCs don't give feedback because it would reveal that their processes are biased and based on irrelevant details.<p>3. Good candidates <i>do not</i> want interviewers who look past all their flaws, and that's not what I was trying to say. Good candidates want <i>relevant</i> feedback. ""You're too old to do this job"" is not relevant feedback. ""You don't understand $x well enough to do this job"" is great feedback.<p>Also, in the real world, there's bias and it sucks, and great candidates/founders will be aware of this, and work to combat it. That doesn't mean I'm going to throw up my hands and give up on trying to eliminate bias.",1339645719

I'm not a fan of this government, but I just have to intervene here...
I think there are A LOT of things that could be better (corruption scandals, the whole mining business, poverty in the northern provinces, etc).
But still, I think that it's much much better than the previous ones that had taken us to the worst crisis of our history, while selling half of the country to foreign companies. And of course, the alternatives in the opposition are not better yet (Macri is just like Berlusconi without the sex scandals... unlike his father Franco, lol... and  the ones frome the UCR are a joke. Binner may be an option though, but he has to prove it).<p>Now, Having said that:
YES, the government is not telling the real inflation rate but given that the salaries are raised a 25-30% each year, for most of the population, there's really no difference. - If you have an inflation of 25%, but your salary raises 26%, you can buy the same amount of things, even when the crude numbers are higher -. The main objective of doing this, of course, is to react and counter the vulture funds who bought up a relevant part of the country's external public debt at extremely low prices (20-23%), a minimum portion of their nominal value and later attempted to cash them at nominal prize when the economic crisis devastated the country in 2001.<p>There has not been a single case of someone sent to jail, for saying that the real inflation rate is 25% per year. Everyone says that in TV and other media (read right-wing newspapers like Perfil, Clarin, La Nacion, or watch almost any news channel, with the exception being Canal 7 -the state owned channel- but, hey... few people watch Canal 7).<p>Yesterday, there was somebody in a TV program ( in channel 26 ) calling the president literally ""crazy"" and worse, and nothing happens. Even other woman from the opposition, debating with him, was surprised with the aggressive tone, telling him to respect at least the charge, if not the person. And he can say that in TV, simply because this is not a dictatorship, and there's free of speech.<p>There's A LOT of exaggeration in the international mass media, because their main sources of information are the local mass media agencies, who happen to be ""at war"" with the government.<p>If you still think otherwise, please, quote a case of someone being sent to jail for that.",1339645048

The projectionist shouldn't even need to be in the room when the movie starts.<p>I've run into this pattern a lot in web development.

The pre-programmed time can be overridden in the production environment, so you can easily test and know for sure (or as close as possible to sure) whether it will flip at 6:00pm or not.<p>(I'm not saying my solution is perfect, just better than the naive solution.)",1339644943

But keep in mind that a native smartphone app is a thick client; it has all of the view logic.<p>Perhaps I need to back up and explain my point better. Maybe people are misunderstanding me because they think I'm talking about what's going to happen in the next few months. Server-side view rendering is not going anywhere anytime soon. But it's on its way out in that it's an anachronistic way of thinking about the web; it's a relic of the past--of the time of web ""pages""--and not of the future, of web ""apps"" and ""resources"". As long as you are serving content that's primarily to be ""read"", like articles, books, blogs, etc., server-side rendering has its place.<p>But look what's happening to the web. Native iPhone apps have to store their data somewhere, so they communicate to the backend via an API. Cars are reading Twitter. Thinking about the past of the web, only browsers consumed web content. Now non-browsers consume web data via APIs, and I see this trend as increasing.<p>I see a trend where more web apps will be like a ""smart database in the cloud"", meaning they hold data and business logic and communicate via JSON APIs. There may be a variety of client devices accessing this data in the cloud: native iPhone apps, desktop browsers, other Internet-enabled devices.<p>The main point is that clients are no longer only browsers. The clients could be a variety of devices running on a variety of operating systems. So it doesn't make sense for the server to render the view and send it down the pipe for the client to display. It makes more sense for the server to send data to the client and the client to decide how to render it.<p>I'm not claiming that server-side view rendering will go away completely; it has its place with articles and blogs. But with apps, I see a movement toward thick clients and I don't see this trend slowing down. It's hard for me to envision a world in 10 years with less smart phones, less devices hooked to the Internet, and people only accessing web apps and web app data with browsers.<p>Let me also put this in context of the article's original point, that PHP has a nice feature of being able to be embedded directly in HTML. Yes, this is nice. But my point is that if you are starting your web career and therefore are looking toward the future, the types of web sites that will use inline PHP will be more like content sites and less like web apps.

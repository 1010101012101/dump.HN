6341664,comment,6334937,6338533,2,0,vectorpush,,,"<i>I know many women who don&#x27;t find rape amusing.</i><p>So what? How is that sexist? I know many black Americans who don&#x27;t find slavery amusing, does that make the comic racist too? Of course not, because the comic contains absolutely nothing in the way of allusions to race from any conceivable interpretation, the same is true of sex.<p><i>Most ugly rape jokes that I&#x27;ve seen (popular rape jokes? anyway...) are made by men.</i><p>Most popular comedians are men, whether you chalk that up to a sexist society or not, an individual&#x27;s joke doesn&#x27;t become sexist just because the joke is mostly made by men, I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that all sorts of clearly non-sexist jokes fall into the category of &quot;mostly made by men&quot;. I think, at a <i>minimum</i>, the intellectually honest way to judge a joke as sexist is if it&#x27;s made at the expense of an individuals&#x27;s sex (or at least makes <i>any</i> mention of or allusion to sex without consideration for women as a protected class). Anyone can be raped, in fact, male prisoners being raped (as is the case in the comic) is a very common trope. The comic is just not sexist at all, period. Also, what&#x27;s with the &quot;ugly&quot; qualifier? Are some &quot;rape jokes&quot; ugly and others not?<p><i>some of Penny Arcade&#x27;s own fans said, &quot;Hey guys, can you not make light of the fact that some people actually are raped to sleep every night?&quot; And in the face of those revelations by real people they decided to have a laugh.</i><p>That&#x27;s pretty a revisionist version of events. A shit-storm of vitriol (on both sides) erupted over this comic, PA wasn&#x27;t given a kind suggestion by the community, they were flamed as sexist rape culture purveyors straight out of the gate, they reacted by doubling down in defense of the comic, indeed poorly, but with earnest belief in the intellectual honesty of their argument: <i>nothing is wrong with the comic</i>.<p><i>Additionally, the content itself matters less than its audience&#x27;s reactions.</i><p>That makes zero sense. Facts matter, especially when people are whipped up into a frenzy over the supposed nature of the facts.<p><i>This isn&#x27;t some lunatic fringe pulling meaning out of nowhere</i><p>The segment of the audience who didn&#x27;t favor the comic are not a lunatic fringe, they&#x27;re just totally wrong about the comic by all objective measure. They <i>were</i> pulling meaning out of nowhere because we&#x27;ve already established that the comic in no way alludes to violence against women, period. The critics don&#x27;t own the word rape.<p><i>Which Krahulik himself does not: <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/2013/09/04/some-clarification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.penny-arcade.com/2013/09/04/some-clarification</a>\n> I regret the follow up strip, I regret making the merchandise, I regret pulling the merchandise and I regret being such an asshole on twitter to people who were upset.</i><p>Yes, he regrets all those things (except the original comic), that doesn&#x27;t mean he agrees with the critics (he clearly doesn&#x27;t).<p><i>When you say Women are not made unsafe by the selling of t-shirts based on the comic it tells me that you don&#x27;t know what it is to feel unsafe or be a woman.</i><p>That&#x27;s a considerably presumptuous and condescending statement. You&#x27;d feel pretty stupid right now if I told you that I actually <i>was</i> a woman (i&#x27;m not), but just because I hold certain beliefs (i.e. &quot;don&#x27;t be a dickwolf&quot; printed on a t-shirt is not threatening) you presume that I couldn&#x27;t possibly know what it&#x27;s like to be a woman because of course we should reasonably expect that a normal woman would feel threatened by a passive line of text ironed onto a shirt. I mean, look at the first comment on the article, a female rape survivor who <i></i><i>gasp</i><i></i> doesn&#x27;t read any threatening connotation into dickwolves.<p>Once again, women are not made unsafe by the t-shirt. Wearing a t-shirt doesn&#x27;t make one a rapist, it doesn&#x27;t encourage rape, it doesn&#x27;t support rape, neither the shirt nor the comic  depict an assault of any kind, and women in particular have a dubious relationship to the comic in any capacity (since it was a white male prisoner who alluded to being raped by a Dickwolf)<p><i>I&#x27;ve read a lot of first-hand accounts of women saying they felt unsafe in a crowd of men cheering for rape.</i><p>Yes, a crowd of men cheering for rape would be quite scary... except that never actually happened and you completely undermine your credibility when you repeat such falsehoods as truth. They cheered because they support the artist, the comic, and the perceived push-back against capitulation to pressure that pulling the merch represented. To say that those men cheered for rape is about as dishonest as it gets and it&#x27;s that type of rhetoric that sends otherwise open-minded men into defense mode.<p>Anyway. Agree to disagree. Glad we kept it civil :).",1378489685

Mandarin and Wu are different &quot;dialects&quot; of the same &quot;language&quot; because they&#x27;re from the same country. Italian and Spanish are different &quot;languages&quot; because they&#x27;re from different countries.

Beijing and Shanghai dialect are almost totally mutually unintelligible, but if you walked from Beijing down to Shanghai, each village, town, or city you pass will speak a dialect that&#x27;s still mutually intelligible with the immediately neighboring village/town/city&#x27;s.<p>But really, the words &quot;dialect&quot; and &quot;language&quot; mean essentially the same thing in English.",1378489564

So many great collisions of emotions and ideas.<p>After reading it I understood that the author was deeply offended by the characterization that the Yahoo! logo could be redesigned in a weekend. I get that, they work at a high end logo design studio, it&#x27;s like telling a Ferrari mechanic you spent the weekend with some tools from Pep boys and tuned your Ferrari to give it an additional 15% BHP. The dissonance of knowing, as a professional in the space, what it takes to re-design a logo, and Marissa&#x27;s characterization of the same, really irked this guy. That left me wondering how much of that irritation was professional pride.<p>The meta point the author is trying to make, which is that brand and logo are intertwined but the dependency relationship is backwards in Marissa&#x27;s post, reminded me of the clothes argument. That is the argument about the phrase &quot;The clothes make the man.&quot;<p>The two sides of that argument are that your a better person if you dress well, and if you dress well you are a better person. Which follows which? Can that even be resolved? I had this discussion with my teenage daughter when she wanted to dress like a pop star, who dressed like a slut. We had the whole talk about how clothes are a sort of &#x27;marketing&#x27; for the person you are, and people will set their interactions with you to how you dress first, and the way they know you second. So if their first setting is &#x27;slut&#x27; then you may get so pissed off at them that they never get to see the real you, and a friendship opportunity is missed.<p>So our author has extrapolated that it is how you are as a company, that emerges in your logo, not your logo defines how you are as a company. And I tend to agree with that, but I also know that companies evolve based on how they see themselves. So the argument that Marissa is trying to create a <i>perception</i> which then manifests as reality is certainly plausible. I know when Yahoo! called me a while back (in the Carol Bartz days) and said they were looking for engineering leadership for the Web&#x27;s #1 media company I thought &quot;Hmm, this is a company that is not in touch with what they are.&quot; but it was what they were trying to be.<p>So my summary of the article is that the author&#x27;s pride was wounded by Marissa making it sound like Logo design was trivial, and attacked both her understanding of logos and the whole branding process in response. Along the way he gave us a couple of interesting things to think about.",1378489409

The credit card companies will let the payment through based on the number alone as long as you present an expiry date in the future. But it&#x27;s illegal to continue to charge past the expiry date of the card for recurring payments <i>after</i> the date that was entered when the subscription started, and you&#x27;re not allowed to change that expiry date yourself without the customer presenting the card again, with the new expiry date. (It&#x27;s really easy to guess though, just set it 5 years into the future and that&#x27;s a pretty good stab at getting it right).<p>The reason why it works is because you&#x27;ll get a new card, with a new expiry but with the old number. Still, doing this is against the TOS. Easy to do, not proper and very very bad form towards the customer and the card company.<p>Stuff like this can cost you your merchant account if a customer decides to take it as far as they can.

At no point do you ever have to resort to writing code in any other language.<p>Also keep in mind that slowness is not the only problem one encounters with numerical code  I&#x27;ve personally have much more frequent trouble with memory usage. I&#x27;ve written far too much insanely convoluted Matlab code to try to avoid blowing out the memory on a 100GB machine (or 1TB these days). It&#x27;s generally just barely doable using find, sparse, sub2ind and ind2sub. If I had to resort to writing C code every time I encountered one of these memory problems, I would just write the damned thing in C and scrap Matlab altogether. On the other hand in Julia for such situations, I can just write a few for loops and not only do I avoid blowing out my memory, but the code gets faster too, and I&#x27;m never required to leave my high-level environment.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6329237"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6329237</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/profile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/profile/</a>",1378486941

People write functional code in languages that have no support for multithreading all the time.  (Further, functional programming isn&#x27;t often used for cases where optimization is super important -- imperative code can often yield faster solutions.)<p>Functional programming makes code simpler in a lot of situations.  Statelessness is one of the big draws of the functional paradigm.  If I&#x27;m debugging in a functional language and I find a variable has the wrong value, I can rule out stateful problems -- for example, I know I didn&#x27;t accidentally reset the variable, and I know there&#x27;s no code off in another function (or worse, another source file) that&#x27;s messing with the state of the objects I&#x27;m managing.  If you&#x27;re debugging in a functional language, you can basically be certain that you got your algorithm wrong, which is helpful.",1378486917

Either you level the playing field with respect to informational advantages across the board, and you prosecute bad actors with impunity, thus making it unattractive to bad actors, leaving only good-faith actors participating. Or you make it a caveat-emptor market, where no actor has any guarantee of a fair trade, leaving everyone to question any trade they want to participate in. This will drive out all the good-faith actors that know the game is rigged and not in their favor and it will leave only actors who are trading on the idea that they think that the fool at the table is not themselves.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d be very curious to see two parallel markets for securities: one that is completely unregulated where anything goes and one where any bad actor is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, including multi-year jail sentences and fines that are many multiples of past ill-gotten gains.<p>This would leave every actor with the choice of participating in the market they want to participate in, including both investors and companies. Companies could choose to list their securities on one just one of those two exchanges or both, and investors could invest only in companies on one exchange or on both exchanges.<p>The problem with the status quo is that the only actor who knows what exchange they are playing in is is the bad actor. The good actor often will not know that his counterparty is acting in good faith or is corrupting the system until after losses are suffered.<p>Creating a market for markets, where you can choose between unregulated and regulated markets, allows actors to choose which system they prefer to participate in and leaves regulators free to actually enforce the regulations without being soft for fear of what it may do to the market itself, which is exactly what happened in the 2008 crisis. Regulators were scared shitless of really prosecuting bad actors for fear of plunging the world further into a recession.",1378486890

Mostly you just need to explicitly declare the types of your class properties, and then code that uses the properties or modifies them (like .map() or .forEach) doesn&#x27;t need explicit types defined - so it still looks like JavaScript.<p>Refactoring is no longer a search and replace in files (and pray tests pass) affair.<p>Dealing with other programmer&#x27;s code is no longer as mentally taxing.",1375880358

I bet Intellij already has great support, but the top link you give there for Sublime Text, emacs and vim doesn&#x27;t really give anywhere near the level of support you get in Visual Studio. Literally just syntax highlighting! In Visual Studio you get at least error highlighting/completions/code generation/navigation/refactoring.</i><p>It&#x27;s a little disingenuous to expect environments that are typically more text editor than IDE and much more lightweight (Sublime, Vim, Emacs) to have all the features of an IDE with as new as TypeScript is. Much of those features require much more work than they would to implement in Intellij or Visual Studio, which have great APIs for building plugins with those sort of features[1] even for the community[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Custom+Language+Support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Custom+...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin?pluginId=5055"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin?pluginId=5055</a> (The third party Lua plugin for Intellij for example)",1375880355

It&#x27;s the use of stealth to deliberately attack civilian targets <i>in order to affect political change</i>. (My working definition only). The goal of terrorism isn&#x27;t dead people, and you don&#x27;t weigh a terrorist campaign by how many bodies it creates. Terrorism is all about striking fear into the heart of the population in order to get them to <i>vote</i> or behave differently. That&#x27;s why the tactic of terrorism is so effective against modern democracies. With the help of mass media, a few crazy people can inflict fear on millions.<p>So sure, in response to the United States&#x27; government implementing draconian surveillance technology, some 20-somethings that live in their parent&#x27;s basement and have no life (notice how quickly the stereotypes come?) will strike out stealthily in order to inflict fear on the population, to be noticed.<p>But what he&#x27;s missing is what military leaders in Iraq and Afghanistan have learned: you don&#x27;t put out fires by dumping gasoline on them. In other words, the asshole that approved of this idiotic idea to store everything possible and then  search later is the last person in the world you want defending it. He&#x27;s gone off the reservation and somebody should shut him up before he makes things worse.<p>If the establishment starts circling the wagons on this issue, and it looks like that&#x27;s what is happening, it&#x27;s going to drive a wedge between the people and the government. This is not a good thing for them to be doing, terrorist threat or not.<p>All these political and agency leaders are betting that the next time there&#x27;s a terrorist attack -- and there will be -- that anybody who supported killing this program will be rounded up and laughed at. I&#x27;m not so sure about that. I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it.",1375880246

6172448,comment,6171813,6171813,7,0,cclafferty,,,"I think Chrome&#x27;s implementation of security is flawed. If you stop thinking about this security as being a switch which is on or off and instead as a granular scale then you&#x27;ll agree that Chrome&#x27;s password handling is as low on that scale as possible. Now just so you know, I&#x27;m agreeing that Chrome can&#x27;t fully lock down your passwords and I&#x27;m OK with the reasons why (convenience), but their doing something wrong here, they&#x27;re not looking at the in-between.<p>The difference I see is if my spouse or boss wanted to look at my passwords they could, easily. I&#x27;m not OK with that. Now, tell me they have to install a trojan, a virus or some other software first to get access to my passwords and thats a level of safety which stops my boss. My boss won&#x27;t have the technical know how to do it. My spouse could be looking just out of curiosity, the smallest roadblock would stop them. Chrome&#x27;s implementation makes it easy for anyone to see passwords and that&#x27;s just wrong!<p>The length of time anyone will have access to an unsupervised machine plays a role here.

But here this text is vibrating strongly with one of the core idea of daoism, it is impressive.<p>It could be found more closely in Zhuangzi or even Lizi. These guys were living in a time when many have been killed for their ideas, and many had strong beliefs. Their solution for survival was to be an empty vase, a useless tool.<p>A good example is the tree: a straight trunk is the sure path to death for a pine tree, while if you are twisted in a way that makes you useless you survive much longer.<p>There is also this empty boat story. If a big vessel sees a small boat in her way the captain will shout at the small boat, but let the small boat be empty and the captain will just move around.<p>Daoism is all about being this empty boat. And it is it&#x27;s limits: society also need people with strong belief and ready to die for them.<p>Just take slavery; it is a moral belief and duty to be against slavery. Even if by some rational reasoning slavery was proven a better solution than freedom, we would still have to stand against it, and some have died for this moral belief.<p>So I think I cannot fully agree here.<p>Edit: Or to be more precise, there is a limit to the reduction of one&#x27;s identity.

6172430,comment,6168926,6168926,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"The VC-funded startup scene is full of frauds: fake startups, fake technology (manual work being sold as high-power machine learning), and promises made with no intention of keeping them. It&#x27;s a shark&#x27;s world, not for the faint of heart, and not a good place if you&#x27;re a bad judge of character (unless you&#x27;re prepared to learn, painfully, in that arena).<p>I&#x27;ve worked in finance and in the startup world. Ethics in the startup world are a lot worse. Finance has more reach (see 2008) but the people who will completely fuck someone over just to make a nickel are just not as common. Even if you get politically unlucky in finance or otherwise end up being laid off, you&#x27;ll still get a severance and a decent reference. They&#x27;ll send you off in a decent way. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve seen startup CEOs ruin peoples&#x27; reputations just to do it.<p>OP&#x27;s complaints have nothing to do with the company being YC, and certainly nothing to do with it being pre-A. The most unethical people I met in the startup scene were the management team of a well-established post-D startup in New York. (The CEO is from an extremely wealthy family and pulls connections to raise money in spite of his own incompetence and the mediocrity of the leadership; otherwise, the company wouldn&#x27;t exist, but you knew that.) These people have used extortion to settle severance disputes, hired multiple people into the same exact leadership role as an explicitly intentional recruiting tactic, and were so dishonest with investors that they&#x27;re known for it in New York, which might be why the Series E seems to be a struggle for them. <i>That</i> is in a company that has passed VC vetting four times.<p><i>YC doesnt necessarily mean sure shot success. Paul Graham is a human and bound to make mistakes.</i><p>Well, fucking duh. No one is a perfect judge of character. No one. You have to make decisions on people based on extremely minimal information that has more to do with someone&#x27;s charm and social skill than anything deeper. You only know if someone&#x27;s a good person when they&#x27;re really tested; you don&#x27;t see that in a few hours of superficial interaction. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re not willing to bet on people based on almost no real information, you can&#x27;t make any deals at all and that&#x27;s generally considered worse.<p><i>Go for post Series-A. VCs have already done the vetting for you.</i><p>They&#x27;re not going to be any better than YC was. Judging character is just fundamentally a hard problem. Look at the Stanford Prison Experiment. A change of context turned normal people into monsters.<p>Most of these startups do not match the ideal we have of Google&#x27;s early days: technical to the core, well-managed, etc. The bad news is that about 75% of these VC-funded startups still fail (but you knew that). The ugly news is that <i>at least</i> that percentage <i>deserve</i> to fail. Sorry, man.<p>So, OP drew a dud. It happens. I&#x27;ve drawn two and I&#x27;m still alive.",1375880070

This piece throws in some speculative numbers about iTunes vs. Pandora vs. Spotify, and explains that if only non-paying Spotify users listen to a given track it takes 600 listens to equal one iTunes purchase, in terms of royalties.  (For paying Spotify users, BTW, it&#x27;s only 60 listens.)<p>Although some artists, notably Radiohead, are taking Spotify to task over this, I&#x27;m curious about why this is considered differently to the old dynamic of broadcast radio vs. LP/tape/CD, where there was no way one broadcast of a song cost the station as much as buying a single, and that broadcast was nearly guaranteed to reach more than 600 listeners.  Is it that Spotify users can choose the songs they listen to, and maybe burn themselves out on their favorite tracks, where in radio they&#x27;d run a few chosen songs into the ground but if you wanted to hear anything else you had to buy the album?<p>What&#x27;s even more noteworthy to me was Pink Floyd putting just about everything they&#x27;ve got on Spotify.  They were one of the famous holdouts on iTunes ostensibly because they wanted their works to be experienced as entire albums, and are part of the group attacking Pandora over its seeking of royalty cuts.",1375879720

Take an axe and break the door down. That should probably bypass almost any kind of residential door. Alternatively, break a window.<p>The reason to have a master password to protect Chrome passwords, for most people and in 99.9% of cases, is that not that we fear we&#x27;ll get hacked by some random jerk. It&#x27;s to prevent a casual acquaintance from discovering our passwords easily.<p>At this point, I think what may have happened is that, at some point, the Google Chrome Security made a decision based on logic that had numerous merits, but doesn&#x27;t work too well in practice. Now that they&#x27;ve committed themselves over and over by defending this practice, they&#x27;re so vested in this decision, that they&#x27;ll defend it, even to their professional demise.<p>Again, I think their original decision not to have a master password was a smart decision, but not a wise one.

Just how is it possible to import the passwords from these applications, then?<p>It actually is impossible for malware to instantly send off all of your saved passwords if you&#x27;re using Firefox and have a (reasonably decent) master key set up. I assume Opera has a similar master key option. The keyword however is &quot;instantly.&quot;<p>Now, the malware can and will still of course modify HTML on the fly and steal your passwords immediately after you login to websites, but it would probably take quite a bit of time for it to collect nearly as many passwords as there are stored in your browser&#x27;s password vault, especially if you use websites that don&#x27;t require you to re-login very often. And the longer that time window is, the higher the chance the malware will be detected either by odd computer behavior, or an AV detection.<p>They can also set up a keylogger and wait for you to input your master password at some point. It can sometimes be hard to determine what logged text is actually the master pass, due to how many keyloggers work, but this is of course a viable option.<p>All-in-all, master passwords do in fact hinder attackers. The first thing many malware spreaders do is dump browser and other saved credentials (often FTP, sometimes IM accounts so they can spam malicious links to contact lists); it&#x27;s often a quick &quot;in-and-out&quot; dumping process. It&#x27;s not uncommon for malware to successfully execute and exfiltrate some data as soon as it&#x27;s loaded, but later as it infects other files or drops additional payloads, AV will fire and the user will try to clean up the machine.<p>And then there are the very simple cases of &quot;friend/acquaintance uses computer, looks at your passwords really quickly, memorizes a few, goes home and screws with your accounts at a later time.&quot; Master passwords make that sort of situation fairly impossible.<p>I really do not personally see why Chrome doesn&#x27;t allow master passwords as an option. It would not be a security silver bullet, but it does help.",1375879449

Deeper down of course, the model of &quot;real men&quot; contains a rubric for determining success which applies to all the ambitious regardless of gender.<p>I cannot prove that his remark is homophobic, but entanglement of insult with a lack of conformance to a purely heterosexual model of human relations and the connotation of heterosexual masculinity in particular certainly are meta-data consistent with homophobia.",1375879443

Simply &quot;Ctrl-a z&quot; to disconnect and later reconnect &quot;somewhere else&quot; exactly as if you hadn&#x27;t disconnected.<p>You can do something kind of like that with a tiling window manager if you put VNC in between the user and the window manager, such that all access is via VNC.  However VNC doesn&#x27;t transparently remap like screen does, so you can get icky issues with mismatched screen resolutions in VNC.  In that way screen/tmux is MUCH better than doing something kinda like it with VNC.  OR rdesktop, or whatever.<p>In .screenrc I&#x27;d suggest startup_message off, vbell off (because I don&#x27;t like it), and some lines similar to bindkey -k k1 select 1, bindkey -k k2 select 2, so that function keys insta-switch you.  Also I have a &quot;caption always&quot; line that resembles line noise but it begins with the hostname and shows exactly which sessions I&#x27;ve opened and highlights the one I&#x27;m looking at right now.  I probably last messed with it 15 years ago so I don&#x27;t remember how it works.<p>You can put lines in .screenrc like &quot;screen -t bash 0&quot; to autorun a bash shell in screen 0.  You could put something like &quot;watch procinfo&quot; in screen 0, or tail something, or whatever.<p>For all intents and purposes screen overlaps tmux about 99.99%.  There is a small 0.01% area where featuresets and bugs do not overlap.  There&#x27;s a cultural thing where &quot;most&quot; screen users know about screen and tmux, and &quot;most&quot; tmux users don&#x27;t know about screen, which is mildly interesting.",1375878760

By definition they&#x27;re partisan.</i><p>(NOTE: I&#x27;m not rigorously defining the word &quot;governance&quot; in this\nresponse, I can expand on my meaning further if people are\ninterested)<p>Paul Graham is on to something in this essay. I think, however,\nthat Carl Jung pinpointed the exact mechanism with far more\naccuracy.<p>Politics and Religion (for many people) in Jung&#x27;s system of\nthought are often vehicles of &quot;transferance&quot;, or, the transferring\nof one&#x27;s spiritual principle or governance principle to a receiver\n(a priest, or politician, or guru) because people&#x27;s psyche&#x27;s are\nlargely unconscious and rarely question or examine their own\nidentity (consciousness, although Jung has a much deeper\ndefinition of identity). People &quot;transfer&quot; to the closest external\nmatch for that which their unsconscious wishes to have integrated.<p>Paul&#x27;s statement about it being a part of their identity is\ninaccurate because it&#x27;s actually the opposite. If the person in\nquestion were <i>not</i> transferring their spiritual principle it\nwould actually be an integrated peice of their identity and\nconsciousness. There would no longer be an imperative to defend\nthe vehicle that carries such an important peice of their\n&quot;self&quot;. As people integrate more of their transfers and projections they have less and less need to justify their existence because that existence is self-contained rather than fragmented.<p>Understanding that the spiritual and governance principles within\nthe psyche are actually subjective and not objective experiences\nis a sign of someone that has <i>truly identified</i> those\ncomponents. I say &quot;truly identified&quot; not because truth is defined\nby an authority or natural principle but because the person has\nidentified the truth of it in relationship to their own\nnon-physical (mental/psychological) experience.",1375878017

They might not need you now, but they may in 5-10-15 years. They&#x27;ll knock your door and tell you: you are married have 3 kids and are gay. If you don&#x27;t want your family to find out here is what you do. That&#x27;s why they need it brother. Because google knows more about us than probably anybody else in the world.

A movie fan cannot know whether a character is played by Jesse Eisenberg or Michael Cera with any degree of confidence until he observes the whole movie. This is because the parts played by these two actors can only be accurately modeled by a complex wave-like function. Cinematic physicists are not sure, but it seems likely that, for any given movie, the part of the geeky outcast is played by both Jesse Eisenberg and Michael Cera simultaneously. Only when you watch the movie does the waveform collapse and you observe one or the other actor.",1375877053

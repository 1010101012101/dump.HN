To be on a higher level gives you a strategic advantage, yet it can be dangerous at the same time. I doubt anything could be said in a Hacker News comment or a blog post that could help change the way you think or see things, but perhaps pondering the beauty of a higher level of thought, less stifled by insignificant problems, may lead you to shift your perspective. Maybe it&#x27;s not as simple as choosing to think differently, but give yourself a chance, break away from your routines, and maybe it&#x27;ll just click.<p>Also, watch this: <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/68855377\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vimeo.com/68855377</a><p>Maybe it&#x27;s as simple as choosing to think differently.

6940450,comment,6939710,6940407,4,0,abduhl,,,"I don&#x27;t understand your question. A problem for what? For the geophysics methods or for the TBM?<p>Geophysics methods give a measure of density based on wave reflection/refraction and are therefore at the mercy of energy absorption of a given material. Resolution is a function of energy and so the ground smears in your results. The variability of the ground may or may not pose a problem to the geophysics methods used, it depends on how they do it.<p>For the TBM, inconsistency in the ground can obviously pose problems. Based on what I know about this project (which is not much), Bertha has mixed face tooling on its cutter head but is primarily a soil machine. This means that large boulders can pose a problem as the cutter head isn&#x27;t designed to deal with massive, hard objects most likely. The way most of these soil machines work is that they have a cutter head with tooling that essentially scrapes the soil and there are windows in the head that open to an area behind the cutter head which the soil moves through before being spit out as muck from a conveyor or screw jack. This area behind the cutter head generally has a system to crush large rocks that enter this area into sizes that are fit for the muck system. The problem arises when you have a rock too large to fit through the window as the cutter head isn&#x27;t really equipped to bust up rocks (for multiple reasons).<p>Let me know if that didn&#x27;t answer your question.",1387525884

6940427,comment,6939009,6940025,3,0,strlen,,,"> As for military conscription, that only applies to citizens, so if your children take US citizenship instead of Singaporean citizenship (US practices Jus Sanguinis, so I think this is possible), they wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about military service (I&#x27;m not Singaporean or an immigration lawyer, so don&#x27;t take my word on that).<p>If you (like afaik, Sivers) surrender the US citizenship, is there any basis for children taking US citizenship?<p>> In short, expats can totally avoid having that reality hit them. Expats tend to live in a totally different world than the natives of the countries in which they settle.<p>I think that&#x27;s what bothers me, but I am also somewhat at a loss why: it is just for a country to allow an expatriate class that never takes citizenship, but which others contributes (indeed, that is a positive). It is legitimate for individuals to choose to forego the benefits of citizenship in order to avoid the associated responsibilities, yet I can&#x27;t help by somehow sneer at a group of people who are in a country quasi-permanently (i.e., not a short-term business trip) by choice (they aren&#x27;t fleeing famine or oppression -- which would be a different matter) by choose not to become its citizen.<p>I also don&#x27;t think Singapore is a bad place. Quite frankly their immigration policies are far better than a large chunk of the world. They certainly put a far larger expectation on their citizens, but nothing really out of bounds of a Rawlsian &quot;decent country&quot; -- basic civil rights are respected. On the other hand US is guilty of a crime of omission -- there are many potential immigrants coming from unstable, dangerous, and poor places that are denied the right to settle in US, but would be able to settle in Singapore.<p>I guess if I had to pin it down, what bugs me is the way many Westernerns move and settle in countries without regards to their culture and ways of living -- out of purely material and practical concerns.",1387525361

6940406,comment,6939267,6939267,1,0,malandrew,,,"So 1-2 weeks ago my girlfriend forwarded me an article from some rightwing conspiracy nut journalist that covered all of the issues in this article. That article however was based on gross misreadings of the original academic articles on which it was based. Had I not read that previous article, I would have taken a lot more of the content from this article at face value. However, with the curse of knowledge and the fact that every example in this article mirrors that article, I can&#x27;t help but think that this author basically rewrote that other article in a much more convincing matter and conveniently leaving out all the academic references, that upon closer inspection refute some of the claims here.<p>The thing that bothers me most about this article and the original article is that no causality is established and no other possible causes considered. The studies on bluefin tuna for example showed higher levels of radiation, but not dramatically higher levels and still at levels considered safe for consumption. The other primary sources I read suggested the same. Articles like this should definitely ask questions as to what else could cause so many problems, so widespread. For example, I would expect increased quantities of dissolved CO2 to be a much more likely culprit for these symptoms. Laboratory experiments with three tanks of fish, one control, one irradiated and one exposed to greater amounts of atmospheric CO2 and CO would do more to suggest the true cause that the speculation presented here.<p>I really wish I could find that article as evidence, because it was one that the average educated HNer would tear apart quickly, especially on closer inspection of actual data from primary sources.",1387524994

So I am not sure how I am patronizing someone as opposed to stating deeply opinion.<p>I mentioned this in another comment, but John Rawls had the concept of a &quot;decent state&quot; -- which may have a radically different tradition than, e.g., US or UK, but one where basic civil rights are still honored and respected. Singapore fits this bill, so I don&#x27;t think its system should be condemned in the same vein as many states (perhaps majority of the world today) where, e.g., civil wars flare and religious and ethnic persecution is a day-to-day reality.<p>> 2: People move to Singapore because they&#x27;re narrowly selfish<p>Sivers did surrender his US citizenship, so I can assume taxation did have some reason that choice (although it could be simply to avoid double taxation -- .sg taxes plus US taxes on top -- rather only choosing lower taxes).<p>However, I never stated that all -- or even most -- immigrants to Singapore do this. I can only state this about <i>Westerners</i> moving there <i>permanently</i> (it&#x27;s another matter about living there temporarily as part of a job, etc..), for most of whom taxation plays a determining role.<p>I am actually aware personally of many people who moved to Singapore for far different reasons (fleeing civil wars, seeking basic economic opportunity) -- but none of them were Westerners. For example, I attended high school and university with people who grew up in Singapore having fled grinding poverty in Burma or reeducation camps in Vietnam. In what I think is a huge criticism of US, their families were not initially allowed to enter the US: they were only able to move to the US once their parents established themselves in Singapore, obtained the right employment and education, and move to US on H1B visas.",1387524564

6940332,comment,6939710,6940039,90,0,abduhl,,,"Large TBMs like this generally allow access to what is called the face (the area being excavated) via a double bulkhead system. The ground conditions in Seattle require that the machine be able to control the rate of excavation at all times such that a large sink hole does not form due to uncontrolled loss of ground. This is done by keeping pressure on the face.<p>The pressures required to keep the face stable are a function of the soil properties, lithology, and groundwater. The typical way for someone to access the face is to pressurize ahead of the machine head with gas and have workers enter under pressure (known as a dive or an intervention). Workers generally are limited in how long they can be under pressure and must go through decompression.<p>Edit: real quick calculation on my phone puts them at about 70 psi or 4.5 atm of pressure to do a manned intervention, possibly higher for safety<p>Disclosure: underground tunneling is my profession.",1387523270

That&#x27;s the basis for confidence in empiricism, and that&#x27;s where solid empiricism ends.  Belief in a designer motivated many great men of science to understand this marvelous design, Newton himself being one of many.  There&#x27;s an unlimited world to be studied in the present, all with a high degree of confidence because it can be subject to strictly empirical testing.  Quantum theory, understanding DNA, figuring out sleep, curing diseases, the list is really infinite.<p>When science tries to take what it knows in the here-and-now and extrapolate those present-knowns <i>billions of years</i> into the past, that&#x27;s where confidence should drop.  At that point it&#x27;s trying to take a hard-won confidence in present observations and borrow it for explaining the past.  But it&#x27;s not justified there.<p>It&#x27;s like trying to say you could observe a stock for 40 years and extrapolate that tiny slice of price history billions of years into the future -- and then proceed to claim to confidently know not only what the price was at the end of those billions of years, but also the price action along the entire way.",1387523236

I&#x27;d already lost ~20kg before that, and lost the next 10kg in 35 days, by comparison. At my lowest weight, day 559, I&#x27;d lost 27kg from when I started recording (about 80% of the total I want to lose).<p>Unfortunately, at day 1033 I&#x27;ve gained about 12kg since my lowest point, so overall loss of 15kg (58% of total to lose). So lost a bit of ground and seem to have really hit a plateau in the last year.<p>This has been with the assistance of a lapband as of four years ago.<p>Not to be discouraging, but it seems you make the big losses early and it gets harder.

9568607,comment,9566008,9566008,0,0,digitalzombie,,,"Cassandra is a pretty good NoSQL database. I&#x27;m a big fan of it.<p>Of course if your data change often and very quickly you shouldn&#x27;t be using Cassandra. You&#x27;ll end up tombstone death. Deletes are not real delete, they&#x27;re soft and just have a timestamp that eventually will be deleted (tombstone). Every delete creates a tombstone, if you&#x27;re hashkey/column key have 50 tombstones, it have to go through those tombstones before getting the values. The reason is some trade off for faster write but shitty read if you update a lot of the same key.<p>Overall, one way of thinking of it is a souped up hashkey db that can do some relational queries which is much more than the usual hash key noSQL. Seeing how it&#x27;s a hash key type database you can see the trade off of Cassandra and it&#x27;s siblings versus say MongoDB or CouchDB.<p>I used it for time related stuff that has simple data. It&#x27;s mostly immuatable so cassandra was perfect for it. Example is a daily tv show release date.",1432022225

I would have no issue with internet.org if they provided free basic internet access. They do not, and this is a VERY important distinction. Internet.org is a gated community with a gatekeeper and no security. It is like AOL or an intranet. It is by definition limited, excluding and discriminatory. It is very much not free basic internet.<p>> But that’s as if I were to tell you that giving anti-malarial drugs to people is wrong, because the right thing to do is to eradicate malaria itself.<p>The malaria analogy is a straw man. The resources and effort required to eradicate malaria are vastly larger than the effort and resources required to distribute anti-malaria drugs to a group of infected people. If they were the same it would obviously be both good and right to eradicate malaria. However, they are not.<p>The effort and resources to provide a gated internet.org and the effort and resources to provide an open internet.org are the same. Thus it is both good and right to provide an open internet.org.<p>> I don’t pretend to understand the massive logistical challenges involved in implementing this, and it makes me sigh when others no more knowledgeable than myself make armchair proclamations about what should or should not be done.<p>Unlike you, <i>I</i> do know what I am talking about having made a career in the telecoms industry.<p>Feeling good about internet.org is about as smart as feeling good about price dumping.

9568573,comment,9567290,9567290,0,0,lukego,,,"We have three main use cases for pcap filters (based on pflua) in Snabb Switch:<p>First is ad-hoc filtering in applications. &quot;If this is an IPv6 control message for the address of interest then put the packet on this queue.&quot; The filter notation is convenient for this and if the filters run as fast as hand-written code then why not use them.<p>Second is end-user configuration. For example we have a &quot;snabbnfv traffic&quot; program that connects a 10G NIC to several QEMU virtual machines with Virtio-net. We support defining stateful packet filters by pcap filter expressions. This is a powerful tool that is already documented and familiar so it is easy for us to use in the interface. It is a power tool though and you can easily write an expression that does not do what you mean. (Happens to me too.)<p>Third is as an intermediate language. For example, we translate OpenStack &quot;Security Group&quot; rules (ACLs) into pcap filter expressions for the snabbnfv traffic process. This allows OpenStack to provide a simple and limited interface to the user and for us to map that onto our more general mechanism underneath. I see this as future proof in terms of supporting more front-ends besides OpenStack and also supporting extensions for special needs e.g. matching on exotic protocol headers.<p>So I am pretty happy with the current state of affairs. I do think there is a lot of potential for pflua to move things forward and I am looking forward to seeing more projects pick it up so that we can cooperate on this.<p>If you are tempted to adopt pcap filters then check out pflua from Igalia: <a href=""https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/packet_filtering_pflua/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/packet_filtering_pflu...</a>",1432021375

This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem in itself if the user would get some value in return for the UX regression, however most of the time the reason for the splash screen is just caused by the tool itself.

All the problems that happen around the leap second are due to the poor &quot;management&quot; around it not that it&#x27;s actually a big absolute difference from the reference atomic clocks.<p>Case in point: the Linux leap second kernel bug that made problems in 2012. Read the commit of the fix:<p><a href=""https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6b43ae8a619d17c4935c3320d2ef9e92bdeed05d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux....</a><p>&quot;This patch tries to avoid the problem by reverting back to not using an hrtimer to inject leapseconds, and instead we handle the leapsecond processing in the second_overflow() function. The downside to this change is that on systems that support highres timers, the leap second processing will occur on a HZ tick boundary, (ie: ~1-10ms, depending on HZ) after the leap second instead of possibly sooner (~34us in my tests w/ x86_64 lapic).&quot;<p>So the bug was the effect of the programmers more worrying that the leap second adjustment happens as fast as possible, in 34 microseconds, ignoring that the call from that particular point in code made the livelock.<p>And instead of pushing the change &quot;as fast as possible&quot; we see that both Google and AWS solve the problem by spreading the changes over the long periods of time.

The only way to make it faster is to avoid it, that is to simply know the stuff. The more you know, the faster you think, that is do what looks like thinking.<p>- Emotions may disrupt any expert; you&#x27;ll forget what is 3 by 5. There&#x27;s a comment here already that mentions it, and I second it, because I was that guy. One of best decisions in my life was going to a shrink :)<p>- There&#x27;s a structured approach to problem solving; formulate the problem (current state), the goal (the desired state), list alternatives, weigh them, choose. This may sound obvious, but a lot of otherwise smart people do not do this and simply pick the first idea that pops to their minds. Changing to structured problem solving helps immensely; it&#x27;s actually used as a therapy.<p>- Some high-level heuristics may help: six thinking hats, TRIZ (although this one doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a heuristic), morphological analysis, and so on. Their primary purpose is exactly that: quickly generate many different ideas and views and make sure to cover as many important bases as possible. Each has a special flavor; TRIZ, for example, aims for elegant minimalist solutions.<p>- Every blessing has a curse. I once read &quot;Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team&quot; (it was made into the &quot;Munich&quot; movie) and there was an episode when a Soviet special agent got killed primarily because he was a trained special agent who is always ready and aware of what&#x27;s going on.

It&#x27;s one company that has shown utter disregard for the privacy of their users.<p>The primary aim of internet.org is to map and build a deep graph of every living being and bolster Facebook&#x27;s monopoly. \nIn the short term, some might applaud the &quot;free&quot; internet carrot but the whole concept is detrimental to innovation in the long term. Either provide &quot;real&quot; internet without any strings attached, or else don&#x27;t be surreptitious about your intentions and claim to do it for the good of humanity.<p>Billions of people would be happy accessing the free-but-limited internet and wouldn&#x27;t have any privacy concerns. However their privacy isn&#x27;t the only issue here. The problem is that these people would be unknowingly contributing to the success of the walled garden developed by FB & friends. In the future, companies aligned with them will have access to a trove of data & eyeballs. Those that aren&#x27;t aligned or want to compete with them, would be shut out. This is anti-competitive. One might argue that without internet.org, these people would not have contributed anyway. However, the premise of &quot;free&quot; will result in a lot of paying customers to switch. And, many of those who don&#x27;t have an internet connection today, might get one in the near future. One that&#x27;s low speed and perhaps subsidized by the government. To understand that, you have to look at the growth rate of mobiles in 3rd world countries. The bottom of the pyramid does contribute to the success of many tier-3 cellphone manufacturers. There are people who earn less than a dollar a day but they stay connected with a mobile phone. With a connection that&#x27;s not limited by any corporation.<p>As the old saying goes, &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as free ...&quot;. One way or the other, someone has to pay for the internet. It&#x27;s not going to come out of the FB shareholders pockets. The question we need to ask is, who is actually paying for it and what&#x27;s the actual cost (not literal cost) to this freebie.<p>It would be a lot better if the government or a neutral organization like Mozilla takes up this initiative. I would be happy to contribute to an initiative that provides free or subsidized internet to the masses. An internet, where there&#x27;s no restriction on which site you can visit. An internet, where nobody will track you or collect your data or re-sell it.",1432020320

But there are interconnections between the networks of the flight control systems and the entertainment network in some aircraft. Here&#x27;s such an interconnect unit, the Teledyne Network Extension Device (NED)[1]: &quot;Teledyne Controls&#x27; Network Extension Device (NED) is a high-performance and compact networking solution that facilitates data transfer between avionics systems and IP-based equipment, providing greater accessibility to a wide range of applications. This high-reliability device, built to OEM standards, combines the multiple functions of an ARINC 429 to Ethernet converter, multicast router, firewall, data loader and communication gateway, in one single and lightweight unit.&quot; See this block diagram [2] showing the NED gateway plugged into the in-flight entertainment system on one side, and the flight management system on the other.<p>The block diagram shows the flight management system as an output only.  The NED gateway seems to be treated as an untrusted device.  The flight management system (which can be thought of as turn-by-turn navigation for airplanes) does not directly fly the airplane, but the autopilot, and the human pilot, usually go where it sends them.<p>The NED does have the ability to update the &quot;electronic flight bag&quot;, which contains navigational charts, aircraft manuals, and FAA and company paperwork.  Those are updated frequently, so there&#x27;s now a data distribution system to update them.  (They used to be loose-leaf binders with frequent update packages.) But those have no connection to the flight controls.<p>A bigger concern is that software updates to the aircraft systems pass through the NED. Those can now be transmitted by radio to some aircraft.[3] The new files are stored on a server for updating when the aircraft is parked and the equipment is in a maintenance mode.<p>So, while taking over the flight controls in flight seems unlikely, some variant on a Stuxnet-type attack might be possible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.teledynecontrols.com/productsolution/ned/overview.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teledynecontrols.com/productsolution/ned/overview...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.teledynecontrols.com/productsolution/ned/blockdiagram.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teledynecontrols.com/productsolution/ned/blockdia...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20140923154447/http://www.teledyne-controls.com/productsolution/wlds/overview.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20140923154447/http://www.teledy...</a>",1432019758

AIUI, every Elder Scrolls game since Morrowind? The Crash Bandicoot games? The Jax and Daxter games? (The Jax and Daxter games use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp</a> and the Crash Bandicoot games use its predecessor.)<p>> At any point, do those games allow trivial fetching of new code from the network from an unspecified source, parsing and executing that code in or out of a sandbox?<p>Every single game that permits custom levels that can include scripted elements fits this bill. See, though, this is a strawman. Almost every competently designed website is just like a AAA game in that all of the code that that site runs and all of the assets that it loads were explicitly selected by the dev team and tested by its QA team. Moreover, any user-supplied data is carefully handled and constrained so that processing of said data is low-impact and non-disruptive; just like in a AAA game.<p>I also note that you&#x27;re refusing to engage with folks who call you out on the fact that your argument that &quot;Having to handle a wide array of obscure image formats and potentially invalid XML makes page renders and reflows slow!&quot; is bunk.",1432019497

9568486,comment,9568383,9568383,0,0,DiabloD3,,,"Except the article fails to say that upcoming LTE Advanced service is &quot;true&quot; 4G, not 5G.<p>4G has multiple requirements and are only satisfied by LTE Advanced and WiMAX 2. Both were ratified in 2011 by ITU-R in the IMT-Advanced specification. The major sticking point is true 4G devices and networks must support up to 100mbit/sec for mobile devices, and up to 1gbit/sec for stationary or low motion devices.<p>In other words, there have been no real 4G (as in, LTE Advanced) deployments worldwide (very few at the end of 2013, most of them in 2014, all of them with extremely limited scope), and none at all in the US. What they are now calling our existing LTE and WiMAX networks is &quot;3.9G&quot;.<p>A major feature being introduced by LTE Advanced is complex MIMO, where not only can a device MIMO to a single base transceiver station (one or more of these are on a cell phone tower), it can also communicate with multiple ones belonging to the same network in disjunct physical locations (ie, you could be in a middle triangle of them, and connect to all three if they were configured correctly), and also be able to MIMO with a heterogeneous cluster (as in, a nearby tower and a next generation femtocell sitting on your desk). Most phones will only support 2x2 or 3x3, which is enough to support smooth hand off as you pass by towers. Up to 12x12 is supported, I believe.<p>Other major features are allowing much wider channels, better forward error correction, higher coding complexity (128QAM), and requiring support of cross-band MIMO support<p>Nexus 6 and HTC One M9 (both 2x2, 300mbps downlink maximum) and Galaxy S6 (3x3, 450mbps downlink maximum) support LTE-A, and upcoming LTE-A capable home access points may support up to 8x8 and/or wider channels.<p>A test by DoCoMo managed to get 5gbit/sec with a non-stationary 12x12 100mhz channel test rig.<p>Heterogeneous MIMO seems to be required for Google-Fi, which explains why Nexus 6 can do it but not Nexus 5, although that is just an educated guess.",1432019472

They allowed developers to clean up native resources (file handles, satellite links, etc.) that they might have been wrapping.<p>.Net 2.0 introduced something called SafeHandle. SafeHandle inherits CriticalFinalizerObject which triggers special GC treatment of the finalizer. SafeHandle does a bunch of work to help you write a safe wrapper for an unmanaged/native handle.<p>You should <i>almost never</i> see a finalizer in modern C# code (there are extremely rare exceptions). Notice that the MSDN page for the dispose pattern[2] has [finally] been updated to omit the finalizer. The dispose pattern is the preferred way to do deterministic resource cleanup (in combination with SafeHandle for native resource cleanup). In .Net finalizers are now the wrong tool for the job in the majority of situations.<p><i>Another thing not mentioned in the article is that if you implement a finalizer your code becomes multithreaded. Once you have a finalizer your disposer needs to become thread-safe (and lock-free, you must never use a mutex in a finalizer). Finalizers are bad.

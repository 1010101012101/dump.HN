8701286,comment,8698986,8700995,0,0,graycat,,,"I heard that at GS Rubin pushed
<i>algorithmic trading</i>.<p>Sure, would&#x27;ve been great to have met
Simons.  Heck, I never got around to
working in differential geometry but
at one time did get the notes of
S. S. Chern!  And once tried to understand
a seminar of an A. Gleason student!
But I did cover exterior algebra, 
from both Fleming and Spivak.  Now
I have Cartan&#x27;s book, now in English!<p>I have no idea just what Simons did
to make his $12 billion or so,
but likely it had to do with <i>algorithmic
trading</i> in some sense.<p>Once I did get an interview at
Morgan-Stanley, showed them some
work I&#x27;d done in mathematical 
statistics, I later published,
and mentioned that I&#x27;d like to
work in the applied math of 
trading but got no interest.<p>The people on Wall Street made plenty
of money and didn&#x27;t need me.<p>So, I decided to go where I could 
make money just by pleasing users/customers --
do a start-up, i.e., hire myself.<p>From headhunters, I got a lot of
just hostility:  The main reaction
was that in looking for a job I
was doing something wrong.  For
another, my resume said I&#x27;d been
a professor.  Right, I had been.
So, the head hunter got all twisted
out of shape suggesting that I
claimed the title of Full Professor.
Nope, I claimed no such thing.
The headhunter was eager to be
nasty.  Bizarre.  Dysfunctional.
Destructive.  Nonsense.<p>I don&#x27;t know what Wall Street wanted;
I have to doubt that much of Wall Street
knew what Wall Street wanted;
whatever they did or didn&#x27;t want,
they didn&#x27;t want me.<p>It&#x27;s a very old problem:  If working
very high up, then are almost certainly
(Simons is a grand exception) are
working for people who, net, don&#x27;t
know measure theory.  Then a person
actually making use of such math
will have a huge interpersonal
<i>interface</i> problem.<p>Quite broadly
one of the main bottlenecks in 
getting value from technical work
is the problem of the awkward,
often bitter, interface between
a good technical person and a less
technical superior.<p>I have heard that the lawyers have 
a solution here:  A working lawyer
is supposed to report only to
a qualified lawyer.<p>Really, then, a technical person with
some valuable technical work should
just start their own business.<p>Or, how many people on Wall Street
working as applied mathematicians
and not for themselves 
earn money enough to live
in a nice Manhattan townhouse
or apartment?  My guess is, not many
and that, instead,
the big bucks, say, for a $20 million 
townhouse, are going to
non-technical people, management,
sales, IB, trading, firm ownership, etc.",1417723195

8701284,comment,8700136,8700300,0,0,panarky,,,"The essence of the Assange and WL strategy is to force their opponents to build elaborate defenses against leaks. These defenses will then degrade the effectiveness and potency of their opponents.<p>From the source[1].<p><pre><code>  The more secretive or unjust an organization is, the more leaks
  induce fear and paranoia in its leadership and planning coterie.
  This must result in minimization of efficient internal communications
  mechanisms (an increase in cognitive &quot;secrecy tax&quot;) and consequent
  system-wide cognitive decline resulting in decreased ability
  to hold onto power as the environment demands adaption.

  Hence in a world where leaking is easy, secretive or unjust
  systems are nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems.
  Since unjust systems, by their nature induce opponents, and in
  many places barely have the upper hand, mass leaking leaves
  them exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to replace them with
  more open forms of governance.

Basically git&#x27;s interface to the storage are open() and read() system calls.<p>On the other hand fossil chose to store its artifacts in a SQL database because it makes interaction much much easier (it&#x27;s just a SELECT; the SQL engine does the rest). Moreover, since fossil has access to a SQL database, it can cache a lot of information to make future extraction of information easier: instead of scanning the whole database on every read (or building a custom index as git does) you can create custom tables for your use case that point to the correct artifacts. Oh and SQLite is just an implementation detail, the real thing that matters is SQL.<p>So the real advantage of using SQL(ite) is in querying the data to produce all reports you want: list of commits/checkins, list of changes related to a file, list of issues linked to a given file, ...<p>That said, when you have an extremely simple data model and you have few different access patterns for which SQL wouldn&#x27;t be of great use anyway, you can have your own file format as git does.",1417722391

I set up a deal with a factory in Brooklyn to handle print / pack / ship and wrote software to handle batching orders to them daily and updating customers.<p>Also, I created a DIY tool for people to customize their own which cut down on tons of e-mails of people asking for custom covers and having to do graphic work.  <a href=""http://creditcovers.com/DIY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://creditcovers.com/DIY</a><p>It&#x27;s been cool. Ton&#x27;s of press, customers include people like Google, Ben Cohen - founder of Ben & Jerry&#x27;s, celebs, Obama, etc.<p>Because CreditCovers are so effective, our single greatest marketing tool is just to give them away which always results in a positive ROI on referrals.. So that said, anyone who wants one with their start-up logo / dog / gf / mom / whatever on it can go get one... Use code &#x27;hackernews&#x27; to get $10 off an order and get one free.

8701160,comment,8697772,8698255,0,0,nicklaf,,,"I&#x27;d like to mention one more thing, which is very important to keep in mind when studying pure mathematics: if you feel like you don&#x27;t quite understand something, do NOT, under any circumstance, &quot;pressure&quot; or force yourself into believing it.  While the saying &quot;practice makes perfect&quot; is perfectly applicable to computation, you have to be very careful when studying pure mathematics to fight the instinct to try and convince yourself that you understand something.  It is perfectly okay not to understand something.  The chances are, your best shot at understanding something that makes you uneasy is to simply admit your present situation doesn&#x27;t yield any direct lines of attack toward a better understanding, and to tuck the problem in the back of your mind, until a later time, when further study (possibly in an unrelated area) unexpectedly leads you to the missing piece.  You also have to be on guard against allowing trying to form an intuitive understanding of something, before you&#x27;ve fully understood how the idea follows from the definitions and proofs alone.  Forming an intuitive understanding of ideas in mathematics is always about understanding the connections between abstract ideas, but the abstract ideas themselves should have no intuitive basis when considered by themselves.  For very simple things, it is probably okay to rely on intuition in a pinch (e.g., you can safely think of the derivative of a function at a point as the slope of the line tangent to the graph of the function at the point).<p>To use a crude analogy, you could think of mathematics as one giant puzzle, but with the pieces coming in slowly, one at a time.  Any two pieces have a fairly small chance of fitting together, but since you only have the ability to focus on one or two pieces, you need the memory of old puzzle pieces which previously did not fit anywhere in the back of your mind, so that when you do stumble upon the fitting piece, you can go back to it.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the best truths in mathematics are the most general.  Every time you consider a specific example, you should always have some amount of innate desire to see a more all-encompassing idea which handles the details of the specific example as a special case.  It will usually not be possible for you to come up with the right generalizations yourself, though; mathematics has evolved gradually over the last couple millennia, and it has taken the trial and error of many brilliant people before the &quot;right&quot; abstractions were found.  Your best hope is that your teacher (or author) is leading you on a path that will eventually allow you to see how the things you&#x27;ve come to accept as true can be thought of as existing within a broader framework.  The fact that applied mathematics books generally do not do this at all is the reason why one cannot simply try to learn about a topic in applied mathematics, and then try to learn the pure setting as an afterthought.  If you go straight to the applications and computations, the chances are that you will be leaving out the conceptual legwork that will be needed to understand the subject in a way that can allow you to potentially create new theory.<p>To take the puzzle analogy further (to the point of breaking it), you can try to view the generalizations as pieces that connect to MANY puzzle pieces simultaneously (which is obviously not how an actual puzzle works, since each piece only connects to adjacent pieces).  As you progress in mathematics, you start to see that the subject is composed of a sort of hidden hierarchy, in which you later learn that your past findings are subsumed by more general theories.  Without this, the subject would be unwieldy, since no normal human is capable of committing to memory a perfectly interlocking body of thought that is only made of mostly isolated ideas.  Inevitably, you will need some governing ideas, which form the root of a sort of conceptual hierarchy.  However, this conceptual hierarchy is more or less impossible to convey pedagogically (c.f. all the complaints about &quot;New Math&quot; back in the `60s), without first understanding all the pieces involved.<p>(For reasons discussed in the above paragraph, you should be prepared to accumulate a very large number of books and documents, should you begin to more broadly become interested in mathematics).<p>One way to increase the probability that you&#x27;ll find interlocking pieces in the same span of attention is to be guided by an excellent teacher (and in some cases, an excellent author).  Otherwise, your best shot at exploring the space of possible directions to take is to follow this advice of Paul Halmos: &quot;A good stack of examples, as large as possible, is indispensable for a thorough understanding of any concept, and when I want to learn something new, I make it my first job to build one.&quot;<p>All that said, it is true that any successful student of mathematics will eventually reach a point in his or her studies in which the writing of proofs has become natural enough that, when given a theorem that has a straightforward proof, it the student will probably be able to find it 80% of the time without too much stress or outside help.  Getting to that point is important; therefore, a significant chunk of the value of studying a book like Spivak&#x27;s or Pugh&#x27;s is to increase your ability to write proofs.  This will be a gradual process, so don&#x27;t be too discouraged when you get frustrated.  If you feel like you need to improve your proof writing skills, though, it would certainly help to take a break from the analysis text, and read an elementary book on proofs (just search Amazon or a university library) until you feel like you&#x27;ve done a good job of building up this skill.  The ability to write proofs with ease is as important in pure mathematics as algebraic manipulations is important in applied mathematics.<p>One last warning.  If you truly become skilled at pure mathematics, be aware that it can be addictive.  Research mathematicians spend their entire lives on this stuff, and are most often quite happy to give up a great deal of things which non-mathematicians value (e.g., a career in industry).<p>Of course, this really depends on how addictive a personality you have, or if you are unfortunate enough to be a creative genius.",1417721592

If/when they do, they will easily succeed.<p>Right now, the farthest most have gone is fining drivers a relatively small amount, which Uber pays. What happens when they step that up to seizing the car? Who is going to sign up to be an Uber driver in a city where it can get your car seized?<p>Here&#x27;s how I predict it will go down. Cities will eventually decide to legalize Uber-type services, with such companies required to obtain a license. There will be a limited number of companies licensed in each city--it makes much more sense for the city and its citizens to have a small number of healthy companies than to have a large number of companies barely scraping by. Those licenses will go to Lyft and other non-Uber services, because they have not had the &quot;fuck you&quot; attitude that Uber has.<p>That&#x27;s when the cities will crack down severely on Uber.",1417721566

Since US forms about 20% of the world&#x27;s economy, we can assume the global taxi revenue to be $50 billion. Even if Uber takes in 20% from every ride, I can&#x27;t imagine them possibly having more than $10 billion in revenue. Assuming Uber forms a 60% monopoly, they won&#x27;t be making more than $6 billion in revenue. Kindly correct me if I&#x27;m completely off here.<p>One way for Uber to overcome this is to bet on the growth of the taxi industry in Asia. But, even in Asia, governments are pouring in massive investments into public infrastructure. When I visit New Delhi, I rarely end up in a cab because the public infrastructure isn&#x27;t all that bad. Public transportation projects are coming up in even the smallest of Asian cities.

8701013,comment,8687804,8691296,0,0,geebee,,,"I think you can criticize targeted visa programs without committing the lump of labor fallacy.  The reason is that very targeted types of migration such as high tech visas can cause market distortions relative to other fields.<p>For instance, every new developer probably leads to employment for baristas, brick layers, dermatologists, mortgage brokers, real estate agents, and divorce lawyers.  Because developers and engineers in general tend to generate wealth rather than redistribute it, this is especially true.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, if you create a visa program to allow easy migration for developers, but <i>not</i> for all those other professions (or you create a regulatory state that makes it very difficult for migrants to join those fields), what you create is a market distortion.  Because new economic activities are available without the competition from the newly arrived migrants, those with existing work and residency rights will have an incentive to avoid engineering and go into other fields.  Even if people aren&#x27;t specifically displaced, even if pay rises a bit, better prospects in other fields may ensure that the existing workforce never goes into software development or engineering in the first place (i.e., someone who would have done so will now instead go into dentistry or tax law).<p>This, I think, is what we&#x27;ve seen - people who have the right to live and work in the US at the time when they are choosing a career path are shunning these fields.  Now, if migration were more general, it wouldn&#x27;t do as much harm to developers, because while there would be more competition, it would be spread evenly across all fields, not just software.<p>Think of it this way - suppose we allowed farmers to come to the US, but <i>only</i> if they grow lemons. If you switch your crop, you must leave, because there&#x27;s a shortage of lemon growers. This would hurt likely harm existing lemon farmers, and you&#x27;d expect them to switch to a different crop (probably avocados, where they don&#x27;t have to compete on price with the suddenly larger and captive population of lemon growers).  There might seem to be a shortage of lemons, prices of lemons might still go up, but until they reflect the opportunity cost (what you could get growing avocados), people with the choice won&#x27;t grow lemons.  In this case, the &quot;come here if you agree to grow lemons&quot; visa program would be creating a market distortion that is preventing the lemon market from &quot;clearing&quot;.<p>This is also why a lot of people who have no objection to general skilled immigration strongly oppose such specific tinkering with employment levels, and why a lot of people feel that there really is no evidence of a developer or engineer shortage when you consider the opportunity cost of becoming a developer for people who are free to choose a profession.",1417720201

Opponents of inheritance being added to Rust have claimed that this is a unique case, and that such a feature would not pull its weight in any non-DOM scenarios (or worse, that it would be redundant with Rust&#x27;s trait system and that you would fall into C++&#x27;s trap of nobody agreeing on which subsets of the language to use). Given the nebulousness of the proposals in this space, I have no dog in this fight at the moment.<p>My other goal was to show that Rust gives you enough tools to manually emulate an efficient inheritance-style dynamic dispatch scheme, even if it can&#x27;t fully prove that your implementation is safe.",1417720062

Note you need your own registry for this.<p>Also familiarity with how union FSes work and using &#x27;docker history&#x27; to trim container size makes it a lot easier.",1417719747

Super-fast growth, media darling, natural monopoly, took lots of capital, ultra-hyped valuation, arrogant, and threatening to a lot of powerful people.<p>Google, if you remember its growth period, basically came out of nowhere.  It was beloved by users and adoption grew rapidly, but they didn&#x27;t start getting serious publicity (nor did they seek it) until around 2004.  They, AFAICT, took only one round of funding, $25M in 2000, before attaining profitability sometime in 2002.  And they worked very hard to seem non-threatening until they were big enough to actually be a threat: remember &quot;we do only one thing and one thing well - Search&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot;, their cordial relationship with Apple, the explicit decision <i>not</i> to challenge Microsoft, and how they only took advantage of companies that were going out of business anyway?",1417719730

1169219,comment,1167820,1168779,0,0,eru,,,"> If you will, think of this as a speculation about a successor language. 15 years from now (say) there will be a better language than Haskell in the statically typed lazy functional languages space, which absorbs the key positives of Haskell, has a few new ideas, and possibly treats Monads differently (or does away with them altogether). Clean (the language) deals with IO with uniqueness types with nary a monad in sight. Is that design ""better""? Worth thinking about.<p>Clean's uniqueness types have the distinction that you can e.g. in theory split the state of the world, thread it to two different function and then put it back together, and make the type system ensure safety.<p>Monads have the distinction that they are not only easy to compose but that composability is baked right into their very definition (and laws).<p>Functional reactive programming might be a good alternative model for I/O and some other things where monads are used.  Also arrows seems to be worth more investigation.<p>Arrows are in a lot of cases the more apt structure that monads.  The reason arrows aren't used more in Haskell already is that the monads have such a nice syntax.",1267789834

The problem I have is following.<p>I live outside of the US and am not a US citizen. I used to sell software via resellers - they pay me 50% of the sales as royalties (something like the app store). Last year I decided to create a C corporation in the US to make the business look more ""serious"". My friend became the only director & CEO of this business (he does this for free). I also signed a license agreement between me & the company where the company gets a license to the software & basically the company pays everything it gets from the reseller to me as a license fee. I send money from the company account to my personal account oversees, as I see fit.<p>Basically all the company makes I withraw to my account in my country. I also pay taxes & everything on this - according to the local law. No  problems on this side.<p>Now I am facing the problem that I figured I need to send the federal tax return - the form 1120 - for the corporation (my friend as the ceo will send this) - to the IRS and starting freaking out that it will look very suscipicous if it shows (for instance) net receipts of $111,200 (this is what the company got from the reseller for the products) and expenses (other expenses) will be license fees of $111,200. I started freaking out that what if the license fee can't be deducted as expense? What if it has to be ""amortized"" etc..? In this case, might I put ""consulting fees"" in the amount of $111,200 as the sole business expense? What I need is to slash the company's taxble income to 0 and what I need to avoid is the company paying any taxes.<p>Can I do it like this? If bad things happen, will the IRS go after me in my country?<p>Please help - this community is a blessing.

Furthermore you can continue to evaluate the evidence and at any point you can decide alter your behaviour based on a new cost benefit analyses.<p>The only likely way it would increase the cost non-organic is if governments started to force farmers to pay for the 'externalities' (i.e. environmental cost) of their farming methods.

In this scenario (the primary reason why many people use it), ZFS is completely irrelevant.<p>Now, perhaps one could imagine a future version of Time Machine that would read from source file system snapshots while making backups to the external target in order to capture versions that were made while the user was unplugged from the external disk; and perhaps ZFS would be appropriate for Time Machine target disks in order to save space via block copy-on-write. I'd say I expect both of these features at SOME point in the future (""expect"" inasmuch as they're obvious wins and one has to think that the future direction of file systems is to include constant time low cost snapshots via copy-on-write), though I don't know if the file system(s) will actually be ZFS-derived or not.<p>But this is a far cry from saying that Time Machine functionality would be free on top of ZFS.

There's just less competition there. There are tons of well read bloggers and journalists who would be very interested in your Android App and the people marketing the phones would probably feature it in their ads like apple did with the ""There's an app for that"" ads. That's how marketers think. ""It worked for Apple, so we'll do it too.""<p>Going to the iphone first will probably take two weeks to a month to get approved while the Android version can update faster with less hassle. You get to iterate faster and get feedback on the latest results. A faster feedback loop is essential to iteration and improvement.<p>After you get some attention, then you can make an iphone version and if you're a top 5 Android app, that's a good reason for people to take a look.<p>In the history of software, I'd say look at Microsoft Excel. It launched on Mac which had some crazy new features like a GUI. It quickly became the top spreadsheet on the mac (there was little competition). Launched on Windows a couple years later and went on to dominate the category.",1251767934

I never heard of someone losing data on ZFS but there are whole businesses based on the certainty people will lose data on HFS+. It could be because all the people using ZFS today know very well what they are doing and the same can't be said about the average Mac user, but, still, ZFS seems rock solid.",1251767847

This ""inversion"" idea still has a lot more mileage in it.

The point is to say ""What if...?"" and proceed from there.<p>Every now and then someone nails something. And every now and then someone building a device is inspired by something they read or saw; the form of the once-ubiquitous flip cellphone came from Star Trek's tricorders.<p>Taleb's theoretical dinner might be woven through with the Internet: did he and his friends decide to have this dinner by making appointments on the phone? Or did they use email? Or Facebook, or even just kinda hooked up via Twitter when one of them tweeted ""hey who wants to go to The Grinning Wok with me tonight #omnomnomsogood"".<p>And maybe that choice of restaurant came in part from reviews online? The Internet is no longer cool, this is true. This is because we're used to it. Hell, the tablet I'm typing this on was cool for like a month after I got it; now it's normal. Maybe a little annoying because the onscreen keyboard sucks and the autocorrect is aggressive and occasionally wrong.<p>The real parts of the future go from ""cool"" to ""normal"" very quickly. Impractical stuff stays ""cool"" in imagination forever.",1354427988

And it's not a particularly good argument.<p>There are a lot of valid reasons for the city to regulate construction: fire safety, traffic control, utility provisioning, transit, urban/community planning, affordable housing, diversity, and aesthetics (just to name a few off the top of my head).  These concerns mean that the city gets to control building policy, and once they do that, <i>how</i> they control that policy is a question of degree.<p>Every city in the world regulates the number and type of construction permits that are issued.  San Francisco may be conservative about issuing new permits, but nobody reasonable is arguing that they shouldn't be allowed to regulate construction <i>at all</i>.  If the city regulators announced tomorrow that it was open-season for new construction in San Francisco, they'd be doing a disservice to everyone who lives here.",1354427248

4860242,comment,4859973,4859973,15,0,general_failure,,,"Excellent write up.<p>I am a good C++ developer but my dislike for the language has grown ever since c++11. Many parts of the language are arcane and unfortunately these parts are used over and over again by many programmers either to show of their 'coolness' or because it's the only possible way.<p>Here try this for size:
<a href=""https://github.com/boost-lib/bind/blob/master/include/boost/bind/bind.hpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/boost-lib/bind/blob/master/include/boost/...</a> (sorry if that blurb made you blind)<p>I also dislike perl. A large amount of perl code contains shorcuts - like $^p or %#p (not real perl patterns but I hope you get the point). These patterns are ungooglable and hard to remember. The only people who know them are those who have spent a lot amount of time with the language.<p>The result is code that is extremely hard to understand and read.<p>Languages must be optimized for reading and not writing. Of course, nobody is asking one to go overboard (like COBOL) but reading a computer program should not hurt the brain and should not require years of training.<p>This is why I will not advocate C++. I would advocate C, Python or JavaScript (yeah javascript, it has it's pitfalls but it's very easy to master). There are possibly other languages like Ruby but I haven't taken the time to learn them.<p>(BTW, If you want to see how C++ could be done right, look at something Qt from an API point of view).",1354426953

So sure, if you're talking about outbound VoIP traffic from the customer's computer, they could do that. But what about inbound traffic, which for nearly all customers is the bulk of their traffic? There can be no way to put controls on who sets the QoS flag, which means everybody needs to set it or they risk having their own service degraded because someone else decided to inappropriately set their own QoS flag.<p>Basically, it's tragedy of the commons.

The city has real problems, of which housing is only one.<p>The SF Weekly (an alternative newspaper here) has published several thought-provoking articles on the state of the city over the years.  They are all titled, ""The Worst Run Big City in the US.""<p>Those articles include:

Well I don't know about you but I'd grin and nod and think ""this guy is a fuckin' douchebag"".<p>I'm not trying to say I think every marketer who ever wrote ""X is the best Y"" is a douchebag; I'm saying that claiming to be ""the best"" is a very, very big claim. Coming from a giant of software it would be questionable; coming from some tiny unknown startup it is simply laughable.<p>Stick to pointing out your merits, strengths and focuses. Don't make a claim to be all-categories, all-uses, undisputed best thing in the world. You are almost certainly not, and to this engineer, it raises questions about what kind of person would even make such a ludicrous boast.",1354424652

The only area that can absorb new housing is china basin (3rd st) and that is being developed. The rest is already full.<p>Do we really want or feel that more people in sf is a good thing?

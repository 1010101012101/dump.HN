Lack of determinism does not create free will; if your actions were totally random and uncaused, then they could not be said to be free. They'd just be the equivalent of unconscious muscle spasms.<p>His belief (Compatibilism) was that free will was not only compatible with determinism, but required it; your actions can be said to be free if they proceed from your personal thoughts and characteristics. Example: if pg had a choice between using Java and Lisp, we could quite confidently predict that he would use Lisp, even if we ran the experiment infinite times. It would still be his free choice, however.<p>It's a quibble over the definition of 'free', but then most philosophical arguments are over definitions of words.",1260886445

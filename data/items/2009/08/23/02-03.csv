780108,comment,779378,779378,0,0,jayemerican,,,"Well, I am just starting with YC and I just came up with a product. None of us, are programmers.  At first, I wasn't looking for funding meant for software. Our product doesn't have to be software. I started to count myself out of the YC.  But then I realized that my product can be in the form of software. So I am designing the software, but I am going to contract someone to write it. But it's a little more complicated that CS, so I have to contract everything technical.  I don't feel bad about it.  If I want to I can learn it, if need be.  I don't have a degree, but my potential co- founders have a PHD and Masters, but they say I'm the genius.<p>I have taught myself everything online. HTML website design and a little flash and I play with digital 3D animation.  I design every site I own. People pay me to design websites and I didn't finish school. Even in school my major was Mass Communications and Journalism, later Music Theater.<p>So, you are and economics major. That's awesome and very important after the product is finished. You will know how to market it to the economy, among other things you know.<p>You feel left out with the CS crew? I use to feel left out to every educated friend I have. But my abilities exceed paper and yours really exceeds your degree.<p>Keep your head up.",1250996263

Whether I pay $200/year or $400/year for gas doesn't make a difference.<p>I suspect that the vast majority of miles driven are driven by people who would find cheaper alternatives, like buses or bicycles or email, if prices went up even 20%. But that's just speculation. Empirically, when gas costs doubled briefly last year, it seemed to me that traffic was still almost as bad.<p>So, I mostly agree with you, but I'm not 100% convinced.",1250995676

I've found that, almost universally, my friends that report mpg have less fuel efficient cars than the ones that quote liters per 100 km when asked about a vehicle's fuel efficiency.<p>I tend to think that one of the reasons that Americans tend to have less fuel efficient cars is that when they are evaluating alternatives 9 mpg and 10 mpg are ""closer"" or more equivalent than 47 mpg and 50 mpg. For example, if I go out and buy a Truck in Canada I could either compare<p>Ford F150: 15.7 liters/100km (15 mpg) city, 11.2 liters/100km (21 mpg) highway.<p>GMC Sierra 2500 4WD: 14.7 liters/100km (16 mpg) city, 11.76 liters/100km (20 mpg) highway.<p>With the Sierra, you are using a full liter less of gas during city driving at the cost of only half a liter of highway driving, so unless I'm doing more than 66% of my driving on highway like conditions, I should go with the Sierra, but that information does not come across to gas conscious buyers that use mpg.",1250994962

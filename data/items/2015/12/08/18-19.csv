If it&#x27;s a mom-and-pop place with a salt on their hash, attackers would get much less &quot;profit&quot; out of their search.<p>Anywho, just going to engage in some half-assed napkin-math to explore the idea:<p>Card numbers: 6 digits for institution and 9 for the customer and 1 for checksum. Let&#x27;s assume merely 20 big issuers &quot;worth attacking&quot;. The possibility-space to search is then (20 * 9^10), or ~70 million.<p>Suppose that--by design--it takes 2 seconds to compute the hash. Covering the whole range would take ~4420 years. That&#x27;s... not a very comforting margin.<p>Perhaps you could hash the credit-card along with the year-month in which the purchase occurred, but attackers probably aren&#x27;t interested in >12 month old cards, so that&#x27;s only a small 12x slowdown there.",1449601154

10698489,comment,10692506,10696122,0,0,kragen,,,"You have an overly rosy view of the current situation, and so you are dramatically overestimating how far photovoltaic has to go to improve it, perhaps in part because you have forgotten the existence of 85% of the world&#x27;s population.<p>I&#x27;m <i>on</i> the grid, and I had a three-week power outage two years ago. Getting to 99.999% would require no power outages for the next 5700 years.  Even getting to 99% would require no power outages for the next 3 years, which isn&#x27;t going to happen; I had an overnight power outage a few months ago.  That&#x27;s because I live in Argentina.  Not out in the boondocks — in the capital, with flatscreen TVs, world-class medical care, and subways crammed full of people glued to their Samsung Galaxy Whatevers.  A friend of mine in Pakistan isn&#x27;t even getting <i>one</i> nine; he has a rolling blackout of an hour every few hours.  He&#x27;s at maybe 70% or 80% grid uptime.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this myopic focus on &quot;Seattle, London, and really most of Europe&quot;.  What percentage of the population lives in the US and Europe?  14%.  86% of the population lives elsewhere.  How about Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Delhi, Mexico City, Beijing, Lagos, São Paulo, and Mumbai?  Those are the world&#x27;s ten biggest cities, and by themselves they total nearly the population of the US.  As it happens, none of them are in the US or Europe.<p>Also, as it happens, most of them are at much more equatorial latitudes than most of Europe and even much of the US.<p>Speaking of rolling blackouts, I lived in California in 2000.  At the time, political corruption in the energy markets led to rolling blackouts there, with a total of several hundred hours of blackout at each location (except hospitals, national security installations, and things like that).  So California isn&#x27;t going to reach 99.999% on-grid reliability within the next couple of millennia either, even without any further outages.  Reliable electricity is very important to some industries, like semiconductor fabrication.  Maxim has a fab there in San José, or at least they did last year.  Maybe they&#x27;d would be better off depending on solar panels on the fab roof instead of the fickle governance of the California transmission grid.<p>The upshot of all of this is that transmission-line parity for most of us is going to occur pretty soon actually.  It doesn&#x27;t need to hit 99.999% or 99.99% or 99.9% or even 99% reliability to be an improvement from where we are now.  In fact, in Pakistan and in much of the world, even if it&#x27;s 50% reliable, it&#x27;s a big help, as long as the times when it&#x27;s out aren&#x27;t the same times the regular power grid is out.<p>Molten-salt solar is certainly capable of some load following, although not as fast as a gas turbine, but it can also handle baseload, because it can run at whatever time of day or night you need.  Can it be extended?  Well, the materials you need are super common and well understood (we were recently treated to an explanation the other day of how Lavoisier made significant improvements to the handling and production of the salts in question in the 18th century), and the heat engine is typically a closed-cycle Parsons steam turbine, same as in a coal or combined-cycle plant.  There&#x27;s no reason I know of to expect it to be any harder to scale than other types of steam turbines.  The only issue is that it will have a hard time producing energy as cheaply as photovoltaic unless we can bring the cost of the machinery way down and its lifetime up.<p>You mention deserts, I suppose because enormous land area is cheap and the skies are not cloudy all day.  But how much area do you really need to generate the electricity we use?  Argentine electricity use, for example, is only about 3000 kWh/year/人, or 340 W/人.  With a typical panel efficiency of 15% (not 22% like some advanced unijunction panels), a typical capacity factor of 18%, a solar constant of, say, 1000 W/m², and a latitude of 34°36’ (thus a cosine of 82%), this works out to 15m²/人, or 65 000 人/km².  The actual population density here in Buenos Aires — the densest and most populous city in the entire country — is 14 000 人/km².  Rooftop photovoltaic is plenty to replace the existing rickety power distribution infrastructure.<p>Pumped water storage might be useful, wind is useful, deserts are certainly going to be immense resources, and cheaper batteries could eliminate the intermittency problem (if they work), but none of those are actually necessary.",1449600928

And instead of taking responsibility for communicating their expectations like adults, they stew in resentment against their employer for shifting that responsibility onto them.<p>If your employer balks at your idea of reasonable time off, then you might think about switching employers. But if you balk at the idea of having some input into your employer&#x27;s expectations of you, then you need to take more responsibility, or move to a company with a less collaborative culture.",1449600495

There&#x27;s also the issue that this person is probably going to jump ship the second he gets an offer to work on ML stuff.<p>As someone having a strong interest in math and theoretical computer science, I think their bias is fair.

This is clear from the disproportional pricing structure - $79 a year for 30GB that jumps to $129 a year for 1TB and then to $279 a year for 5TB - which entices users to go for the higher amounts because they appear to be great deals. What people with residential broadband connections may not realize is that a) uploading even 1TB of data will take a long time and b) SpiderOak cannot, and does not, provide any minimum guarantees on the upload or download speeds (assuming everything else in between SpiderOak and the user looks fine).",1449599584

So in the article&#x27;s context the &quot;nudge&quot; is up against an evolving attack by industrial food against very low-level neurological mechanisms.<p>I don&#x27;t have a good &quot;lay&quot; source for this field, but I&#x27;d recommend digging into Stephen Guyenet&#x27;s blog[1], that is if you&#x27;re up for wading through an academic&#x27;s professional musings.  He&#x27;s a neurobiologist and obesity researcher, and as such the blog provides his perspectives on ongoing work (his and others&#x27;) in this field.  Warning: DO NOT go here expecting any specific answers, and be able to deal with a fair bit of hypothesizing (i.e. untested, maybe totally wrong) both on Guyenet&#x27;s part and via the work he reviews.  You&#x27;ll only really get a sense of how this field is going as you pick up enough context of ongoing work.  IMO, the most interesting self-contained posts that go by are the significant negative results, where robust work comes to light that just crushes an existing hypothesis.<p>[1] <a href=""http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/</a>",1449599043

Our data shows that companies are less likely to hire programmers coming from Java or C# backgrounds.&quot;<p>This I totally understand. Enterprise software is systematically horrible in almost every way: terrible UI/UX, insane degrees of over engineering, high footprint, high cost, and usually at least two to three generations behind on every technological trend. Of those traits I can&#x27;t stress over-engineering enough... it&#x27;s epidemic everywhere but most of all in &quot;enterprise&quot; where you&#x27;ll see insane things like simple web application servers that use gigabytes of RAM and XML schemas that lead to ten-page-long messages to do trivial things. (The use of XML at all is usually a smell unless the domain is very HTML-like such as word processing... and even there extending Markdown would be better in every way.)<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be that way. Those facts reflect the management pathologies that exist in large companies and governments where you have a lot of people managing software projects who don&#x27;t know anything about software... lots of &quot;pointy haired bosses.&quot; You also have a lot of dumb requirements in those areas that twist things out of alignment with what users actually want. Startups very often have the luxury of ignoring stupid requirements unless they have to interoperate with legacy stuff.<p>It&#x27;s so bad that I&#x27;ve actually heard people advise startups to pass on some enterprise <i>revenue</i> if they can afford it (pass on REVENUE!) if it might lead them down an &quot;enterprisey&quot; path, since doing so would in the end result in a systematically inferior product. If the systematic diseases of enterprise are that extreme (and I think they mostly are), then I understand the desire that some startups might have to also systematically avoid developers with enterprise backgrounds.<p>That being said and while I do understand, I think this underestimates the versatility of a good developer. A good developer might have gone into an enterprise job because they need the money but they might be otherwise great at what they do. You can find some great developers by offering to rescue them from enterprise hellholes. Sometimes that alone is all they need to inspire a ton of motivation and loyalty. I mean, you just dragged them out of hades. They&#x27;re gonna love you.",1449599002

It looks like there&#x27;s a .ssh_agent file that can be sourced to update it, though I&#x27;m not finding - at a skim of the docs - what creates that and when.

We can implement that as follows:<p>in .bash_profile:<p><pre><code>    if [ &quot;$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot; -a &quot;$SSH_AGENT_PID&quot; ]; then\n        exec {SSH_AGENT_INFOS_FD}>>~/.ssh_agent_infos\n        if flock $SSH_AGENT_INFOS_FD; then\n            sed -i &quot;1i$SSH_AGENT_PID $SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot; ~/.ssh_agent_infos\n        fi\n        exec {SSH_AGENT_INFOS_FD}>&-\n    fi\n</code></pre>\nThis creates the file if it doesn&#x27;t exist, locks it, and prepends the current session&#x27;s info.

It locks the file, and then reads the first line out of it to populate SSH_AGENT_ID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK.  So if a shell has old values in those variables, you should just need to hit enter to repopulate them.<p>Note that the above assumes that, if you&#x27;re logging in from multiple devices, your agents are interchangeable.  If you need to keep them separate, then adjust the above to either tag the lines in .ssh_agent_infos or use multiple files.",1449598581

The delivery mechanisms are still rough. But for certain applications, in certain tissues, for certain kinds of diseases it is being done today (see Sangamo getting cleared for a gene therapy for hemophilia last week)[1].<p>Currently we have two ways to direct a genetic payload - one is localized (cellular) control of the actual delivery mechanism, the other is (biologically-relevant) temporal control of when the payload gets &#x27;fired&#x27; or used.<p>Practically, we can strip some kinds of mammalian viruses of their own payload (and their ability to replicate), and utilize their own DNA insertion machinery (which is very nicely evolved to match our physiology) to insert a desired payload into the genome of a live organism.  Some tissues are better at receiving specific payloads than others.  (If you find a tissue and corresponding virus that delivers a tissue-specific viral infection, we can likely deliver a tissue-specific viral gene therapy to that tissue.)<p>Once the genetic payload is loaded into the genome we have other ways to control when the payload is actually turned on.  We can make the payload sensitive to tissue-kind, or biological timing events, or sensitive to other kinds of biologically relevant environmental cues.<p>Both of these methods alone, however, are generally leaky.  If the changes you are making are critical either for effect, or for preventing off-target effects, then these two methods alone are likely insufficient for a general population therapy to not be a dangerous gamble.  The consequences of injecting the wrong code (or the right code to the wrong place) can be fairly catastrophic (induced, and immediate cancer).  And that is precisely why a good &#x27;text editor&#x27; is valuable.<p>One intervening point is that most viruses inject their payload into your genome randomly.  And if they happen to overwrite some required genetic code of yours they cause cancer.  Some viruses actually <i>intentionally</i> overwrite the code for your viral defense mechanisms (see HPV overwriting the P53 gene).  In general, random injection of genetic payload into a live organism&#x27;s genome (source code) is a bad idea.<p>The ability to have a good &#x27;text editor&#x27; means we can now ensure that <i>if</i> the payload gets to the desired cells, then we can insert that payload into the genome in a <i>desired</i> location that is unlikely to cause problems.  And since we can further regulate when the payload is fired, we now have 3 levels of control ( 1: localized cellular delivery, 2: localized genetic insertion, 3: biologically controlled activation).  And those three levels together can significantly reduce the chance of mis-editing a live organism&#x27;s genome.<p>Once these three regulatory mechanisms are made safe enough to not just be used in situations where risk/reward ratio is skewed by the lethality a disease, there is no reason they cannot also be used for an arbitrary biological effect.<p>[1] <a href=""http://investor.sangamo.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=944828"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investor.sangamo.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=9448...</a>",1449597738

I am not misunderstanding anything.<p>There are 3 kinds of stuff (for lack of a better term) in the universe: matter, energy and information.<p>Your argument is that because we have infinitely more information, limits to matter and energy are pointless.<p>My argument is that, while it is possible to apply information to enhance the matter and energy processes that support our lifes and our lifestyles, there are hard limits on how far we can push this. This is a matter of mathematical certainty. The curve is a negative exponential. Once you have made a physical process twice as efficient, you&#x27;ve already consumed half of the (upper bound of) potential gains. Surely the multiplier can keep growing an growing to infinity, but the hard savings will be marginal the more efficiency you apply to the process.<p>A second point, which I have not raised so far, is that information itself is subject to the limits of marginal returns. The amount of data that we have keeps growing and growing, but if we lack the processing power to organize it (and I am talking about weat-were here, our computers are not smart enough yet), paradoxically, our capacity to extract any useful application of that data diminishes. There is a name for irrelevant data, noise, and if you mix it with your useful data, you will have to waste processing power to sort it out back.<p>Merely adding population does not fix this problem. You have to increase the percentage of population that receives high quality education in order to begin surmounting this problem. That means diverting young people from other useful tasks and pursuits and shelther them for year or decades while they learn in a nurturing yet challenging environment.",1449597718

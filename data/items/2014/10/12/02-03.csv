There are supposed to be laws written against activities that are prohibited, to prevent prosecutions based on the whims of prosecutors and other individuals, outside of the normal legislative process. If one wants to argue that this type of activity should be precluded by law, then that&#x27;s a valid argument. That still doesn&#x27;t put Anaya in jail however, because even if it were passed, ex post facto laws are expressly forbidden by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3.<p>The bottom line is, Anaya didn&#x27;t play ball with the DEA. They went after him to punish him for not cooperating, not because he broke any laws. It&#x27;s a travesty and a scathing indictment of the current legal situation in the United States that he could even be charged with this crime at all in a state he&#x27;d never set foot in, much less to have a conviction against him.",1413082766

8444156,comment,8442712,8444062,0,0,kyro,,,"I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I&#x27;m usually a fan of what Ron has to say. I&#x27;ve seen him speak at several Startup Schools, but this chat kind of rubbed me the wrong way. He came off as a man who&#x27;s finally settled into more extreme, absolutist, and comfortable views. Very binary platitudes that have no regard for context.<p>This idea that you&#x27;re either born with it or not is an opinion of his with which I take particular issue. A lot of people have their growth spurts later in life. Many are born in environments that often stifle self-derived drive, flounder, and take off. To reduce it to two main camps of haves and have-nots is not a healthy attitude, and will lead to a lot of folks doubting themselves, or viewing others who&#x27;re successful as those who were just born with it, as if people cannot change and qualities develop. In fact, Ron, during SS13, mentioned Ben Silbermann&#x27;s (Pinterest founder) soft-spoken and unaggressive nature, and how Ron was trying to get him to speak up. Ben certainly doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the image of the prototypical founder that Ron is painting.<p>And as to the &quot;age bigot,&quot; I think that&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re focused on social -- that demographic is by nature closer to the pulse of what&#x27;s hot and trendy. But I think it is highly unlikely that a person in their 20s could have feasibly founded a SpaceX or Tesla, or really any seriously industry-toppling startup without having either the connections, the wealth, and/or the industry experience to pull it off.<p>I say all this as a 27yo who hopes to found his own startup in the near future.",1413082698

One end of that crime was Kansas. His physical location when he engaged in the conspiracy is immaterial.<p>> for doing something that wasn&#x27;t against the law<p>criminal conspiracy is against the law. You can take almost any &quot;legal&quot; activity and make the doing of it an element of a crime. For example, saying &quot;Yes&quot; is not explicitly illegal. However, saying &quot;yes&quot; in answer to the question &quot;Would you kill this guy for ten thousand dollars?&quot; would be an element of the crime.<p>> as contracted by people whose plans he did not know<p>Except for the fact that he was selling them secret compartments, witnessed one stuffed full of almost a million dollars in cash, and continued doing business with them. Plus, &quot;avoiding talk of illegality&quot; indicates that he knew what service he was really providing.<p>> and he was convicted, and sentenced to twice the term of the actual lawbreakers<p>He engaged in a criminal conspiracy, so he was also an actual lawbreaker. His sentence was very harsh though, agreed, but he was knowingly engaging in a commercial enterprise that assisted criminals for a number of years.<p>> That&#x27;s not how the rule of law works.<p>Yeah, actually it is. A judge and jury in this case looked at the overall pattern of facts and correctly determined that this guy was aiding people in breaking the law. That&#x27;s how the law works.<p>Its unfortunate that a guy who clearly had developed some interesting skills and otherwise had a kind of messed-up life ended up where he got. But this is not the fault of the criminal justice system, or prosecutors gone wild. This is a guy who made some really stupid choices and got caught.",1413082499

The net-present-value of aspiring to a pro football career is probably in the neighborhood of 10 bucks when the actual probability of success is considered.

All jobs take a mental and physical toll. Most jobs aren&#x27;t fulfilling or notable in any way and the existential terror of living like that is a much great strain on the psyche then getting a few concussions.

8444143,comment,8443727,8443986,0,0,rayiner,,,"First, there is nothing about the rule of law that says you can&#x27;t be prosecuted in a state you&#x27;ve never been to. In this case, Anaya aided a criminal act that took place in Kansas. The fact that he&#x27;s never personally been to Kansas is neither here nor there.<p>Second, the fact that a particular act might be legal does not mean that it is legal to do it in connection with a crime. There is nothing illegal about driving a car. There is something illegal about driving robbers in a car away from a crime scene.<p>Third, willful blindness is not a defense to any charge that requires showing knowledge. Anaya purposefully profited from criminal activity, and even if he didn&#x27;t know the specifics of the plan, it&#x27;s only because he purposefully tried to avoid learning of them. The law simply imposes a higher level of social responsibility than that.<p>Now, it&#x27;s a fair criticism that drug enforcement is a waste of resources and drug sentences are too long. But that&#x27;s quite a separate issue to the points you raise. Say that instead that Anaya was installing traps to help members of child prostitution rings convey cash around.

To summarize:<p>BOUNDLESSINFORMANT: Initial reporting show concrete number on just how much NSA was spying on a whole slew of European citizens.  Shortly afterward, the actual intelligence agencies of those countries stepped up and said that those were not reflected NSA spying on those countries, but instead those numbers reflected communications that they themselves had gathered, mostly from areas like Afghanistan, and handed over to the NSA under intelligence sharing agreements.<p>PRISM: Initial reporting said that the NSA had direct access to the servers of Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc., and could conduct data-mining from them without any oversight.  Actual story ended up being that those companies were handing over data on specific targets under court order - NSA did not have access to any of their servers.<p>XKeyscore: Initial reporting was saying that the NSA was sucking up all communications including Americans.  The author to the story that I linked to was pointing out that Marc Ambinder had previously disclosed XKeyscore in his earlier book saying that it was a system to index metadata that was already collected using other means, and there was no proof shown by Greenwald or indicated in his slides he published that it had been used to collect American&#x27;s communications.<p>The Stewart Baker article: Stewart Baker was interviewed over the phone for the &quot;NSA spying on porn habits&quot; article, but they subsequently left out the core of his argument in order to not undermine their own argument.  I thought that spoke to Greenwald&#x27;s journalistic integrity somewhat - it also puts into perspective the fact that most of the slides he&#x27;s published have been heavily cropped and there&#x27;s no way to independently verify the contents of those slides.<p>The long list of mistakes article: Just pointing that there has been such a rush to report most of NSA documents that most of the initial reporting has had numerous mistakes of varying degrees of severity.<p>In any case, enjoy your social obligations!",1413081892

[...] If the users alter the choices, if only by generating another password if the one they got &quot;does not please them&quot;, then they depart from random uniformity, and the entropy can only be lowered (maximum entropy is achieved with uniform randomness; you cannot get better, but you can get much worse).</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/936/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/936/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secu...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/a/6096"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.stackexchange.com/a/6096</a>",1413081249

That was the point of the XKCD comic - that a random chosen password is stronger than your l33tspeak choice of a word or two.<p>> This means that we should stop blindly classifying password strength based on the number of bits of entropy3, and should consider first and foremost how dictionary-attack resistant the passwords is.<p>If you look at the right number of bits of entropy, then you get this property: a lot of entropy in the password means that the subspace of passwords it lives in is large, and that a dictionary probe of the space is unlikely to find it quickly. Dictionary attacks are just a particular form of brute force that prioritizes some kinds of passwords over others. In the case you actually followed the XKCD example, you&#x27;d have good resistance to dictionary attacks: your password is randomly placed in a large subfield of possible passwords, and the randomness removes any benefit of guessing particular words over words at random.<p>He&#x27;s still sticking to the strawman version of the XKCD comic, and attacking a much weaker idea than was actually presented.<p>> This means that instead of a password strength meter you should be ensuring that there is no skew in the distribution of passwords. If each password is guaranteed to be unique, the advantage of a statistical guessing attack is greatly reduced.<p>He even admits that the solution actually proposed by the XKCD comic would mitigate the attacks he&#x27;s talking about, and only his strawman version doesn&#x27;t.<p>The rest of the article is obvious security cliches about password managers and 2FA.<p>I seriously suggest that this guy stop giving security advice that&#x27;s wrong and clearly just meant to market his own work.",1413079907

It&#x27;s like the adage: &quot;Two can keep a secret, if one of them is dead.&quot; When someone else has access to your data, there always exists the possibility that it can be used in some way you don&#x27;t like.<p>What I wanted to convey is that user data was not used (at that time) in an untoward fashion by Dropbox. Everyone that I worked with took privacy and security very seriously, and we knew that user trust is tough to earn and easy to lose. Handing data to the government automatically, without a warrant or confirmation of authority, would not have been something that anyone was interested in doing. But the government does have ways of making you do things that you don&#x27;t want to do (see: Yahoo).<p>The biggest problem that I have with all of the Snowden revelation stuff is this: people seem quick to blame the companies who are complicit rather than the government who is the root of the problem. The government&#x27;s efforts against security and privacy are the biggest threat the technology industry has ever faced, and if left unaddressed I believe it will inevitably lead to the US losing it&#x27;s leadership position.<p>One last point, regarding Dropbox&#x27;s CFO. Sujay had been at Dropbox for over three years (since 2010) and was involved in the CFO search for a long time. That they picked him for the role says a few things, but I don&#x27;t see it as Condoleezza stacking the deck.",1413079841

8444051,comment,8443998,8443998,0,0,dllthomas,,,"This article includes some good points, but puts them together into something inane.  It&#x27;s true that silly constraints lead to trivial changes that lead to crackable passwords.  It&#x27;s also true that assuming brute force over all character classes included in a password is wrong.  Those are <i>precisely</i> what the &quot;correct horse battery staple&quot; comic was getting at.  Picking words at random (that is, based on a PRNG - <i>not</i> &quot;random&quot; meaning &quot;arbitrarily, by hand&quot;) from a dictionary, brute force over that dictionary is the best an attacker can do, and the (dictionary size ^ number of words) calculation is a <i>correct</i> measure of entropy, and with sufficient entropy no passwords will be duplicated.  The &quot;correct horse battery staple&quot; hypothesis is that this gets a better score on &quot;entropy per difficulty memorizing&quot; than generating passwords by drawing randomly from a dictionary of typeable characters, and I find that to hold - it&#x27;s also easier to type actual words.<p>The other odd point is that we shouldn&#x27;t be advocating stronger methods of choosing passwords because we should be using multifactor authentication.  I don&#x27;t dispute that we should be using multifactor authentication in more places, but even in that case weak passwords are a problem!",1413079545

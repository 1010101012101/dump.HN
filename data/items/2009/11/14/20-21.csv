Now, however well-intentioned it may be, however real the problem may be -- and I agree, it's a real problem -- the law is completely broken. I don't think I can afford to have ""mixed feelings"" on this subject: The law has to be repealed, and its proponents have to try to come up with another answer.<p>Here's a layperson's description of this German law (with the caveat that it comes from an extremely biased source):<p><i>Alexander Stopp, the lawyer for the two men, noted that Germany's courts allow a criminal's name to be withheld in news reports once they have served a prison term and a set period has expired.</i><p>This is the twenty-first century. There is no longer any such thing as a ""news report"", as distinct from a ""history book"", a ""personal letter"", or even a ""word-of-mouth rumor"". There was once a time when you could define, fairly objectively, what a ""news report"" was -- let's try this definition: ""a piece of communications designed to be delivered to thousands or millions of people within a time period less than a month"" -- but now that time is over. That definition is now rubbish. Anything I type here, anything I say out loud near a blogger, anything I write that comes into view of someone else's digital camera can be captured and distributed to the entire world, in much less than one day, for a price too cheap to meter. Anything that appears on the Internet, even if it is buried inside a dry Ph.D. thesis on a single web server in a locked basement on an isolated Pacific island, is one well-placed retweet away from becoming a ""news report"".<p>I wish I knew how else to solve the problem, but even if you believe that censorship was the answer before, it isn't any more.

942081,comment,941740,941740,0,0,wglb,,,"I am (now) a lisp programmer and find myself boring many people to tears about it.  But perhaps I am first a language guy, and like to see new solutions to problems.  None give me the satisfaction that Lisp has (smalltalk was close, however).  But I like to see new well-designed languages and how well, or not, they address the engineering challenges.<p>For example, turbo pascal was written during the time that I was writing a pascal compiler.  The Pascal standard was truly a harsh mistress, and turbo pascal made a lot of very useful engineering choices to make a fast, very useful compiler in a small environment.  Anders went on to do C#, which itself was a good engineering feat.<p>I watch with interest Clojure and the ecocsystem that it plugs into and it has a REPL.<p>But it is a pragmatic fact of life that C is a very large force in the day-to-day world, along with a tool used by serious hackers (c.f. Coders At Work).<p>Python is very nicely designed and gets you to a higher level of programming with ease.<p>So I was curious when Go came along, as a language development observer, to see what were they coming up with.<p>It is clearly a language that has had a lot of thought put into it and it seems to be something that will challenge C on its own turf ultimately. Faster than Python, and possibly ultimately approaching C in speed, it has some useful new ideas.  In particular, how it does goroutines and channels is quite refreshing.  It addresses the admonition that ""threads won't work if they are just libraries"" with new language constructs.<p>So criticism of language ought to be tempered by some experience with the language.  Having done enough of them, it seems that I often don't have a full appreciation for a language until I have done something significant in that language.  So I feel comfortable offering severe criticism of languages like RPG-III and Fortran II and Altair Basic and Bliss-36.<p>I am probably to the point of being a lisp snob by now, but do appreciate the finer points of other languages.<p>I think Go is a step in the right direction for the problem that it wants to solve.",1258230172

They think that Facebook can't be trusted to do well by developers since they're primarily interested in users.<p>Please mention if you're currently actively preparing or have already deployed a FB Connect &/or canvas app. Thanks!!",1258229632

Likewise, it does not seem tenable to endorse the idea that someone who committed a crime can compel or mandate society to ""forget"" about it in all repositories of its institutional memory, including those which are created and maintained by private individuals in addition to governmental organisations.<p>On the other hand, having known and watched people who were incarcerated and rehabilitated attempt to reintegrate into society and lead normal, law-abiding lives and find jobs and housing fail because of the prejudices that arise against them on the basis of their having been convicted of a felony or whatnot, I can definitely appreciate the spirit of this law.  To me it seems absolutely imperative that criminals - up to and including those guilty of capital crimes - be given a new lease on life, contingent upon the terms of their sentencing.<p>For the more conservative, law-and-order types among you who think this is a spineless bleeding-heart rant, I encourage you to contemplate for a moment what it's like to be in the shoes of someone who has committed a crime, experienced years or decades of imprisonment, whose will has been broken and whose remorse consumes them.  As if they do not have enough of a burden to live with - and for far more criminals than you might think, it is a burden they excise with attempted suicide - society has conspired to ensure that it is so much more difficult for them to even meet the basic needs of livelihood.<p>Or consider the case of innumerable teenagers in the US - like the infamous Genarlow Wilson case here in Georgia - that fall prey to the criminalisation of their consensual sexual activity by retarded, ass-backward state laws and then experience a lifetime of stigmatisation by being placed for the rest of their life on the sex offender registries with which the American polity is so obsessively fixated.<p>My point is that the spirit of the law - that convicted criminals who have served their time have the right to be judged on their own terms subsequently without that cloud hanging over their head - deserves at least some intellectual consideration in this case.  It certainly lends the issue some nuance that must be carefully weighed, even if you don't ultimately come down on the side of censorship.<p>It's precisely these kinds of draconian stances on prisoners' and criminals' rights arising from an overzealous, fanatical jurisprudential self-concept that give the US the record and reputation of being rather backward among ""First World"" nations.  The human dimensions of the criminal element must be taken into account;  just because someone committed a crime does not mean they are not a human being and do not deserve your thoughts and your empathy.",1258229559

What I seek from HN is feature suggestions and perhaps, early adoption to make this future network not only possible, but successful. The premise behind my project ""EntrepreneurHive"" is that there is currently no certralized community behind the entrepreneurial spirit. There are many attempts, but all these websites/blogs/communities either lack adaption or lack the ability to interact with fellow entrepreneurs. There must be some happy medium and this is my persuit. This first interation is but one section of an anticipated larger network, it is dubbed ""EntrepreneurHive TV""; for now, its simply built on Wordpress and is essentially a video blog, however what it allows me to do is tag and cateogorize videos from the beginning and it allows you to sort through the various categories for your viewing pleasure.<p>Now to make this successful, what I want to do is build the project from the start utilizing suggestions that would most benefit the Entrepreneur. The all encompassing goal is to build a community in which it becomes the medium that can connect entrepreneurs; I think it would be awesome for an entrepreneur who grows oranges in Flordia to easily find and connect with a fellow entrepreneur in California who also grows oranges, they could discuss tips and trade advice. I want to build the Hive mentality, a collective of entrepreneurs acting as one and helping each other succeed.<p>In following the EntrepreneurialHive spirit, people who are starting ventures or have one up and running, often like exposure. So what I want to do is allow people to submit videos they think are helpful to their fellow entrepreneurs, they can write a paragraph breif about the talk and then I would like those individuals to write a brief about themself; you see, my anticipation is that other entrepreneurs will be watching these videos and by adding your own information about your venture/what you are doing, it will give you incetive to help me out by getting you some exposure. You can add all the linkage you want and there is no such thing as shameful self promotion. Please, keep the links clean.<p>So Hacker News, what do you think about this? I know the idea is not original, but I would like to make the best attempt at executing the idea. Here is to starting small and going big. Critique away. I will be listening.<p>Link: http://EntrepreneurHive.com",1258229288

I've got some\nissues with GA that I can't seem to resolve so I figured maybe MixPanel\ncan replace them.<p>First impression is that it looks really neat and simple, but on my browser\n(ff 3.01) the form fields all somehow manage to hang outside the containing\nblocks.<p>The sign up process is very quick, but there is no email verification, which is\na bit of a pain because it could mean that people use a fake address leading\nto emails dumped on unsuspecting bystanders.<p>After signing up you get a secret token and a skeleton piece of javascript\nthat you can flesh out to track variables that are important. This is mostly\na manual operation, you insert the relevant bits in strategic spots on your\nsite, 'instrumenting' it so MixPanel can keep track of what is happening.<p>The upside of this approach is that you, not they decide exactly what gets\ntracked and what it is called.<p>Right after signing up you are offered to get some 'datapoints' if you get\nsomeone else to sign up, that seems a bit premature, I haven't a clue what\ndatapoints are.<p>Other than the initial signup form error the design of the site is very clean\nand functional, the documentation is easy to read and stuff can be found\nmore or less where you expect it.<p>The 'secret' token that gets generated for your site is not that secret\nhowever, since it is plainly visible in every page that has the javascript\nembedded in it. Maybe it should be named 'site specific' token ?<p>Meanwhile the tag is in place on my site now, and registering visitors\naccording to the live stats, time to read up on the data points.<p>Datapoints are mixpanels way of making a business out of this, essentially\nthey charge you 'per event' on your website. The whole thing revolves around\nthe 'funnel' concept that anybody in internet marketing is familiar with.<p>Garbage in at the top, and 'espresso' out at the bottom, mixpanel allows you\nto track exactly what the loss percentages are at every stage of the process.<p>Datapoints cost money, and I think they are <i>way</i> overpriced.<p>The current pricing scheme is:<p><pre><code>    0...10,000 points:          Free\n    10,000...100,000:           $25\n    100,000...500,000:          $100\n    500,000...2,000,000:        $200\n    2,000,000...10,000,000:     $700\n </code></pre>\nLet me explain why I think they are overpriced: at 100,000 points for\n$25 (the first 'plan' they have)  for any small ad driven website that\nhas an ECPM < $0.25 they are costing you as much (or more!) for your tracker\nas what you were making on your visitors.<p>And on a for-pay site that makes $20 / month per user, with a COA of $5 and\na 1:2000 conversion rate on a 1:50 new traffic vs old traffic ratio (all of\nthose numbers are pretty 'normal') you would again be making a net loss.<p>One of the sites I run that I could have tried mixpanel on gets 3,000,000\npageviews monthly, the ECPM is around $0.11, so it makes $300 /month.\nIt's a no-brainer because it costs less than $5 to host on a flatrate 100Mbit\nleaseweb box. Using MixPanel with that site is out of the question though.<p>So, you'd have to be buying a very large volume of points in one go to make\nit worth your while, but that means a fairly big up-front cost. $700 in\none go is essentially several months hosting cost for many sites. The\nprice difference between 'volume buys' and smaller buys here is\n$c0.007 / hit on the largest plan, versus $c0.025 per hit on the smaller\nones. That's a 350% or so difference. For a virtual product that is\nnot reflecting the difference in cost to the provider, which essentially\nis only the extra cost incurred by the transactions to process the\npayments.<p>MixPanel currently uses Amazon as their payment processor, which\nis a pretty good indication you don't need to worry about where your\ncredit card details will end up.<p>The real time statistics are neat, but they will also be very expensive for\nMixPanel to maintain long term, and they don't seem to add much actual\nvalue, it's more of a gimmick. A functional real-time stats tracker that is\ncheap to operate is very hard to design, which is one of the reasons all the\nfree tracking tools are using batched updates.<p>Google Analytics also allows funnel analysis using the 'goal conversions', only\nthey do it for free and a whole lot more besides.<p>Meanwhile, I've set up a secondary instrumented set of pages, but for some\nreason the data never showed up in the reports. I double checked the code\nand the javascript error console, no idea what is going wrong there. The\n'feedback forum' seems to be mostly enhancement oriented, not set up\nto track problems. It is also externally hosted, which means that you leave\nthe site, it would be better to have a simple ticketing system (a la trac)\ninside the MixPanel environment, where there is a lot more context available.\nIncidentally, uservoice, the site that hosts the forum is listed as a customer\nof mixpanel, but they also use analytics and quantcast.<p>MixPanel will probably work well if you have well defined landing pages and\nare a straightforward e-commerce, but at the current pricing levels it is too\nexpensive for high volume low conversion websites, especially for continuous\ndeployment. And that's a pity because it is especially those sites that would\nbenefit most from a tool like this.<p>You could use it for targeted a/b testing though, but setting up a test\nseems to be quite labour intensive and error prone.<p>MixPanel provides you with csv exports of the reports so you can import the\ndata in to your favourite spreadsheet.<p>On the whole I think that the concept of an analytics site that concentrates\non the funnel aspect of operating a web service has promise, but I would\nlike it to be significantly cheaper and easier to set up. As it is it really can't replace GA for all the other features it offers.<p>edit: in response to an email, COA = cost of acquisition",1258228877

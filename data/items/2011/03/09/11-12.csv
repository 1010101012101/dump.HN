If I am fated to be struck down for my ignorance of nginx internals, that doom must be further down the road.<p>Where I do see failure is when I put the world's most popular blogging software on Apache, turn on caching and give it a gig of RAM to play with, and then watch the server get denial-of-serviced by the totally innocent actions of any ten readers attempting to access the website in a 15 second interval.  Thank you, KeepAlive.  <i>Ten</i> is not a big number on the Internet.  Apache has been DOSed by my <i>younger brother's comic book writing advice blog</i>.<p>I accept that, for historical reasons, the Apache project does not optimize for being useful without being a master of arcane trivia like knowing what options the server is compiled with (!) to be able to operate a college student's blog (!!) without falling off the Internet.  Much software developed these days pitched at web developers, including software which I write, has as a guiding design principle that you should be able to start using it in five minutes following simple instructions and those sensible defaults should mostly work.

As an example: if SSL were an issue, I doubt I would ever use Apache to directly serve SSL anyway, as that's what SSL accelerators are for.)<p>That said, I still wouldn't leave the defaults in place with regards to ""number of servers / threads""; although it isn't like nginx doesn't need the same configuration: the default value of worker_{processes,connections} is almost certainly inappropriate for your specific setup. I also use nginx (as a load balancer), and I have those values at 64/10096, up from the Debian-default of 1/1024.<p>The important thing, to me, is what a technology makes possible, not how well it is configured out of the box. Example: it is more damning to me that nginx only does HTTP/1.0 to upstream servers it is proxying for, a reasonably fundamental limitation of the codebase, than any transgression they could make in their default configuration.<p>Seriously: production is not about ""out of the box"", it never was, and it likely is never going to be. If you are trying to run a production server using ""out of the box"" defaults you are going to be forever disappointed by the performance and functionality of the offerings.<p>To make a minor modification to a statement I've made before (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2145967"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2145967</a> is the reference) about database servers:<p>We (as a civilization) simply do not have the science and theory yet to make the practicalities of setting up and maintaining anything at this level of complexity a totally seamless and simple process with well-understood performance characteristics unless you constrain absolutely every single variable.",1299670086

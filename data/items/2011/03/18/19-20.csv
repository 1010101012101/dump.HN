2341702,comment,2340435,2341027,0,0,tzs,,,"The are three cases.<p>1. Code in Mono that implements things covered by EMCA/ISO standards. These have about the same legal risk as any other EMCA/ISO programming languages and libraries.<p>2. Code in Mono that covers Windows-specific things, like WinForms. This is your highest risk area, although even in these areas the risk is probably pretty low. That's because Microsoft patents would cover the particular way Microsoft did these things. Mono's independent cloning of the functionality is likely to have done them a different way. If you want to be maximally safe, don't use these parts of Mono. Use GTK#, for instance, for your GUI stuff. (That runs on Windows, BTW, if you want your Mono app to run on Windows).<p>3. Code in Mono that covers things not in the ECMA/ISO standard, but not specific to Windows. This would cover things like libraries developed after the current rev of the standard, and such. Most of these provide functionality that exists in most other language ecosystems, such as Python, Ruby, Perl, and so on. If Microsoft has patents in these areas, they are as likely to cover Python, Ruby, etc., as they are to cover Mono.<p>Microsoft has been known to encourage the Mono developers. That greatly weakens any case they would have against Mono.<p>Bottom line: it's about legally as risky as the other languages and ecosystems that would be its competitors, especially if you stay away from things like WinForms. If you would feel legally comfortable doing something in Ruby or Python or Perl, doing the same thing in Mono should be fine.",1300477991

When someone hands you a card, they look at your name first to make sure they heard the introduction correctly, and then your title.  Perhaps also your location.  These convey information that can be important in the conversation.  If a card is devoid of information you might as well just use Bump or a similar app and skip the card entirely.  That's a stupid idea for another reason: pro-tip -- write notes about the person/conversation on the back of their card immediately after you finish talking to them.

Policies like extra baggage charges are extremely poorly labelled for most major airlines such that charts like this one (<a href=""http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/3801089/airline-baggage-fees-chart-updated/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/3801089/airline-baggage-...</a>) are not uncommon to make sense of all the different policies.  Furthermore, policies like the charge for extra headphones or TVs seem to vary not from airline to airline, but airplane to airplane, depending on the media equipment that the plane is outfitted with.<p>I think consumers <i>do</i> want those extra perks and would be willing to pay more for them, but simply do not have the means to make sense of the byzantine airfare purchasing 'system' that we have.  Hence, consumers go with the lowest price as the one thing of which they can be sure. This is why I think Hipmunk is so important as a startup.

I'm not saying it would necessarily be a slam dunk decision, or a decision I'd make on the spur of the moment... but it would be awfully tough to say no to an exit like that, knowing that I'm not getting any younger, and that another chance might not come along.<p>That said, if I were running a company, and owned enough equity to maintain control, and had to face that decision, I would say ""no"" if I believed the $20 million exit was far less than what we would eventually achieve, and/or if staying the course were the right thing to help more of the founders / early employees ultimately realize their own degree of financial freedom.",1300476013

I suppose it doesn&#x27;t make any difference since those kind of issues are more related to the OS or the IDE but i was just wondering.\nCreating frameworks that you can easily distribute in both debug / release mode for both simulator/device has always been such a hassle ( and even more so when it contains resource bundles).",1402765159

So in 1 litter (1/4 galon) at -4Km, the energy is only 400J (.1Wh), and you need submarine grade technology to store it.<p>The potential energy of 1 litter (1/4 galon) of water at 40m (130 ft, a 15 story building) is also 400J (.1Wh) and is much easier to build.",1402765149

In large quantities.<p>I visited your site.  It is simple and straightforward.  But something surprised me:  I was expecting the likes of Accenture, E&Y, Genpact, someone like that, as a target market (internal solutions may exist in these companies, but I have never encountered them, always a cropped screenshot then copy-pasted document, and this has been thousands of times).<p>Smaller clients does make sense:  your target market as smaller clients could knock the pants off larger clients (in a small, accounts payable way) in terms of style an appearance.

But do not demand intrusive personal information (turns off both corporate types trying something out and technologists for a myriad of reasons).<p>I did not detect an option for HTTPS.  This is a must for any site proposing dealing or storing financial or client information.<p>Try a start up form on the front page, or a direct shot of a demo.  Include use cases and customer comments (do not fake these, make them checkable - check with your commenters this is OK beforehand).<p>Word of mouth counts for a lot, especially in professional circles that do not use social media (other than perhaps talk to one&#x27;s family and old friends).  Get a foothold with some oldskool businesses, then when you have a little coming in as revenue seek ways to pump it up (when you&#x27;ve shown it is a credible service this is orders of magnitude easier, in the most unexpected ways).",1402764698

However the landing page is suffering from listing the features instead of the benefits.<p>Obviously you/developers care that it&#x27;s a cool API that will replace the values. Will the mass market? Probably not. They want to know what they have to put in and what they will get out of it. Some visual reference to this would be good.<p>After all it&#x27;s called template2pdf not template2API2pdf :)<p>I can see that currently you&#x27;re thinking in the developer mindset but with some tweaks you could make it accessible for those that can&#x27;t just send a hash. It could be awesome for LOTS of industries. Basically any industry that has sales reps & prepares quotes/invoices on the fly.<p>Maybe they just get a URL bookmark that displays an input form where they can enter their changing values & a PDF e-mailed to them. How great would that be to do mid-meeting on an iPad! A professional quote done before the end of the meeting. No going back to their office to prepare it! Sales reps would love that.<p>I almost missed that the words Template, API & PDF were links - I only found the output example by chance on second look! The output is super important, show it straight away!<p>Try to find a way of showing the template/input without it being a download.<p>Let people test it straight away - only ask for the e-mail/payment when they want to save their finished template.<p>As for not being a spammer, you can easily create content that isn&#x27;t 100% sales pitch. So maybe you start a blog about automating & streamlining procedures, admin hacks etc - then at the end of each post you can refer back to how great template2pdf is.<p>Also, you could get a designer to create some pretty sweet template designs & make them part of the paid tiers.",1402764351

7893098,comment,7889548,7892431,4,0,patja,,,"Spot on.  With so many choices out there for ways to introduce coding, I try to pick the ones that can engage everyone.  Scratch for example.  I teach a lesson on &quot;projectiles&quot; with Scratch where we explore methods of aiming, launching, detecting collisions, scoring, power-ups, shields, etc.  The boys all launch right into building SWAT team versus Ninjas shooting games, while the girls build a game about shooting soccer balls at a goal.  Same learning happens, but they get to come to it on their own terms rather than a one-size-doesn&#x27;t-fit-all &quot;plug the orc full of arrows&quot; objective.<p>It is easy to marginalize this as bowing to political correctness.  What brings it home for me is the actual classroom experience where you can visibly see a significant portion of the class tune out with the reaction &quot;this is not for me&quot; if you start to focus on shooting, exploding, killing etc.<p>With Scratch I can build lessons around music, art, and storytelling that teach the same programming fundamentals and are much more engaging to the girls who don&#x27;t play FPS or RPG shoot-em-up games.  Those inclined in that direction always find ways to introduce some explosions and blood into their projects, so it is not really at the expense of their experience.<p>I raised these concerns to the CodeCombat team on their forums several months ago when I first looked at their offering.  They acknowledged that their platform could be used to design non-violent activities, and maybe they have done so by now.

I mean if you were building a Mk2 human from scratch you might build it that way be we did not arise that way - we evolved from reptile like creatures which had extra stuff bolted on when they evolved to monkey like, chimp like and finally human like beings. As a result much of what we do is as a result of ancient mechanisms resulting in actions that do not always make us feel good. For example you might lose you temper and hit or shout at someone in ways you feel bad about almost straight away but it was not done to feel good, it was done because some ancient aggression instinct got triggered.<p>This stuff I think complicates the whole business of dealing with depression which like aggression often comes from the more primitive parts of the brain.

For example a human voice sustaining a note may have similar cycles, but with enough low-level noise-like variations that traditional deflate-type compression does not help much. However if an algorithm could spot that the second cycle only has small differences to the first cycle, perhaps it could encode the second cycle as a diff to the first cycle. Since the second cycle differences are likely to be small, the bit depth could be reduced (e.g. to 2-3 bits). Then the third cycle could also be encoded as a diff of the second, so even a gradually changing volume can be encoded with a very low bit rate throughout while ending up significantly different from the first cycle.<p>Has that been tried before?

7893061,comment,7892593,7892593,4,0,schoen,,,"Many of these discussions happened in the 1970s as people first became aware that large databases (then often called &quot;databanks&quot;) were being built to store lots of personal information, and that information from one database could be combined with information from another via a database join.  That raised the specter that information originally collected for one purpose could come to be used for a very different purpose.<p>An important result of those discussions at the time was the Fair Information Practices<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTC_Fair_Information_Practice#History_and_development"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTC_Fair_Information_Practice#...</a><p>which came out of two U.S. government studies on privacy during the 1970s.<p>These principles include things that are quite similar to what this article proposes, including notice (of what&#x27;s being collected), choice (about whether it should be collected), and access (to know what others know about you).<p>The Fair Information Practices formed the basis for European data protection legislation, which has now been implemented in some form everywhere in Europe as a result of the EU Data Protection Directive and other legal instruments.  (Of course the Europeans reformulated it and did not directly enact the original U.S. Fair Information Practices into law.)  An interesting consequence of that is that most Europeans, at least in theory, have quite extensive rights against information collection that violates these rules (at least by the private sector).<p>Many Europeans have been able to exercise these rights in practice to challenge data collection and retention by private companies, to see what the companies know about them, or to demand that companies delete information about them.  Some of those examples have been mentioned here on Hacker News; the one that I found the most interesting was when Malte Spitz got his cell phone location records from Deutsche Telekom by exercising his right of access under German data protection law.<p><a href=""http://zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2011-03/data-protection-malte-spitz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2011-03/data-protection-m...</a><p>Anyway, I think these rights are quite similar to what this article is proposing, so I wanted to point out that there is a long history of similar proposals, and that the idea that technology was taking away people&#x27;s practical right to control over data about them is something that&#x27;s been a concern for some decades.<p>By the way, the United States never enacted a comprehensive data protection law, despite being where the Fair Information Practices were first cooked up.  They were never given the force of law in a general way, as they were in Europe; here in the U.S. companies can, in general, collect and use data in ways that would be considered &quot;unfair&quot; elsewhere.  The main consideration in the U.S. is that the companies can&#x27;t lie in their privacy policies, but there are few substantive restrictions on the private use and disclosure of data, outside of particular regulated sectors (like credit cards with FCRA, health care with HIPPA, and education with FERPA).  There is extremely strong industry opposition to a generally-applicable data protection law here.<p>Some sore points about data protection where it did get implemented into law:<p>① European data protection law is leading to some weird and counterintuitive results, recently including the Google v. AEPD/González case where Google was ordered to remove links to old disparaging (but accurate) information about individuals when users search for their names, based on the idea that Google was &quot;processing&quot; personal data about those individuals in an inappropriate way.<p>② Data protection often has major loopholes for government collection of information.  (Government agencies, including police and spy agencies, very often <i>are</i> subject to privacy and data protection laws, but the application of those laws often means just that those agencies are supposed to deliberate about whether they think what they are doing is OK; if so, they can carry on.)<p>③ As this article and this discussion seem to suggest, notice and consent have become more difficult where companies expect to use large amounts of personal data routinely.  The amount of consenting that users would be asked to do and the frequency with which they are asked to do it could become quite annoying and also decrease the likelihood that users will take the time to understand what they are being asked to consent to.  (We can see this to some extent with the cookie notices on European web sites, asking users to consent to being tracked by cookies.  Contrary to the mainstream view of web developers, I think cookie tracking is a serious privacy risk that users should still worry about in 2014 and that addressing this risk is pretty important.  But we can see that the warnings haven&#x27;t necessarily made most users better-informed or more cautious about cookie tracking, and many users are probably kind of annoyed that every site they use is warning them about cookies.)<p>As a result of the last point, I heard a Microsoft executive in a speech say that he thought notice and consent were now <i>obsolete</i> and ought to be rethought.  (This statement isn&#x27;t super-shocking to Americans, who might not even have heard about Fair Information Practices in the first place, but it could have been something of a scandal if he had said it in Europe.)<p>The executive gave the example of the number of different entities that are receiving user information when a user interacts with a major web site, and the number of different privacy policies that would be applicable to these interactions.  He suggested that few users would even read the policy of the site that they&#x27;re trying to visit, let alone the policies of third parties (that might receive user data as a result of embeds or as a result of business partnerships).<p>I thought that preventing and discouraging some of those data flows was actually a <i>goal</i> of privacy protection.  In fact, a lot of privacy software, including software recently developed by my colleagues, is actively trying to stop them, based on the idea that users don&#x27;t know about them and that they aren&#x27;t in the user&#x27;s interest.<p><a href=""https://www.eff.org/privacybadger"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/privacybadger</a>",1402763045

It was passed after the California Supreme Court declared that, under existing law, landlords had no right to evict renters if they wanted to exit the multitenant rental business.  The Ellis Act has one purpose: to make legal the eviction of tenants if one wants to exit the multitenant rental business.  That is not a side effect, bug, or unintended consequence of the law, it is the exact designed intent.<p>This eviction is an Ellis Act eviction.  The reason for the eviction is that the landlord wishes to exit the multitenant rental business, in favor of a condo conversion, something which the Ellis Act was designed to allow.

That&#x27;s about how much I&#x27;d tip a good street performer in New York, and this Kickstarter made me laugh. The comedic timing, as much timing as you can convey in a plain written description, was just right...and I&#x27;ll happily admit, I&#x27;m very curious to see how the hell he&#x27;s going to deliver a &quot;bite of potato salad&quot; (and a photo) to me...I&#x27;m also curious if this will be the first Kickstarter project I&#x27;ve backed that has actually delivered its reward on time. Good for the potato guy for making the kind of joke lots of people may have had in their heads, but actually executing on it.<p>The most annoying protests, IMO, are from the people who ostensibly represent a good cause, like a homeless shelter or cancer research, complaining that a potato salad is getting $45K while they can&#x27;t even raise $4K. Well, what does that say about your cause? Hopefully, it says <i>nothing</i> about your cause, but maybe it says something about your process. If some random guy from Ohio can raise $45K for something that <i>no one should care about</i>, I think the proper attitude should be, <i>damn, just think about how much money I could raise for something people DO care about</i> and then, get started on figuring out how to go about it.<p>The jealousy of goodhearted people towards this goodhearted potato fan is a bit unbecoming. And sad, because if they&#x27;re unhappy about a guy making a shitload of money while being completely honest about what he was doing, how angry will these people be when they learn about the many, <i>many</i> people who raise a shitload of money while being <i>dishonest</i>?",1405036303

One language that has it all figured out, one language that is the right solution for <i>any</i> task.<p>Even if such a language existed (be it Lisp or not), which is unrealistic, there is still a second aspect to the whole thing: programmers&#x27; brains. Different languages map differently to different kinds of brains, and that&#x27;s a very good reason to explore multiple concepts in itself.<p>The Split is the natural way to explore a large search space using different strategies. It happens all over nature, and it&#x27;s the way human-powered research works as well. Monocultures don&#x27;t perform nearly as well. Yes, there is some effort wasted, but you can rarely ever come to an objective consensus where this waste actually occurs - except, typically, in hindsight.<p>Also, there is quite a bit of cross-pollination of ideas happening among different environments and languages, so advantageous traits do get passed around beyond their initial ecosystem.<p>I imagine cross compilers and common runtimes will get more popular, too, now that we have the processing power - and that&#x27;s also a good strategy do deduplicate effort.<p>The only thing that really strikes me as a bad strategy is militantly advocating one programming language as the master race.

For the last 4 and a half years, I&#x27;ve self taught myself iOS development, web development, and a wide variety of other computer related topics.  For over 3 years, I&#x27;ve been doing iOS  consulting for multiple international companies and startups and have racked up a pretty sizeable portfolio for my age.<p>Recently I was choosing my courses for second year and became discouraged at the electives required to continue in the computer science program.  I&#x27;m forced to take things that don&#x27;t interest me like psychology, basic marketing, etc.  This made me question whether it is even worth spending the money to get a degree when half of the work that I put in won&#x27;t even be relating to my field.<p>In my consulting jobs I&#x27;ve worked with and kept up with individuals that have over 15 years of experience in the field with degrees.  In addition, I feel like it could almost be better to consult for 3 more years and even land a full time tech job in my field instead of spending time at university.  In addition, during these 3 years I could optimize for my specific niche: iOS development.  However, I don&#x27;t know if the jobs that I&#x27;ve worked at so far are because of my experience alone or the fact that I have experience and am &quot;still in school&quot;.<p>Every adult that I talk to (all of whom have degrees) swear by them and say how they&#x27;re such a great fallback but I&#x27;m having a hard time connecting the value, especially in the field of computer science.  I suppose for more traditional jobs it would be beneficial but with the boom in startups lately, a degree is seldom necessary.<p>Essentially, is it worth continuing my degree?",1405035761

It&#x27;s because they can live in, and interact with, the common linking and loading ecosystem that the rest of the world lives in: the C ABI. If you can link your output into something that respects the C ABI, you can deploy it[1].<p>Common Lisp implementations could immediately solve their deployment problem by living in this ABI. So far, the only one that has done so is ECL (which is an excellent project).<p>[1] A few alternatives exist. The Java and .NET ecosystems are also viable link targets (as I think Clojure has proved).",1405035134

So, an engineer did a quick &#x27;fix&#x27; to cache DNS lookups. Customer was happy, everyone moved on. Some time later this quick fix got ported into the mainline code base.

My own high school saw better results though, largely because it has an excellent administration which realized that improving the overall environment of the school was key.<p>To tackle the problem of gangs around school, there were a couple of important changes our last principal initiated, that other schools in the area did not necessarily pick up on. 1) Strictly enforce a ban on certain types of clothing that were being used to display allegiance to given gangs. 2) Increase the amount of open spaces for students to stay in while not in classes. 3) Require that students show up to school each morning, even if they do not have classes that morning. 4)Encourage students to stay inside during school hours, even when they have off blocks. 5) Have police/security officers at school introduce themselves to students, and engage students in conversation to get to know them.<p>On the whole the principal was very engaging so it was thanks to these programs that the gang problem was not as bad when I left compared to when I entered. In this case the heightened role of security was leveraged to have some positive effects, something not seen at other schools where there is a fundamental lack of trust between students and security.

In the oral arguments [1], neither Aereo nor the broadcasters claimed Aereo was a cable company. Both had their reasons for this. For Aereo, to do so may have put them at a disadvantage, particularly in the earlier stages of litigation, because the a district court had already rejected a somewhat similar service&#x27;s claim to be a cable company [2]. The broadcasters were also not willing to claim Aereo was a cable company because to do so would be to give Aereo the opportunity to avail itself of a compulsory license. Additionally, from Aereo&#x27;s perspective, they did not believe they needed such a license in the first place, due to its technology.<p>The interesting wrinkle is that the majority opinion [3] clearly likens Aereo to a cable company:<p>&quot;But given Aereo’s overwhelming likeness to the cable\ncompanies targeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological difference between Aereo and traditional cable companies does not make a critical difference here.&quot;<p>They don&#x27;t explicitly <i>say</i> they&#x27;re overruling the district court from Ivi, but it&#x27;s also hard to say they didn&#x27;t just declare Aereo to be a cable company, with all of the rights and responsibilities that comes with.<p>Aereo&#x27;s response today is basically like, &quot;well, that&#x27;s not what we argued for, but we can work with that.&quot;<p>For the broadcasters, there&#x27;s a lot less at stake this time, because the real threat of Aereo operating without paying retrans fees was that other TV providers might use similar technology to do the same.

To do this the opposite way if we&#x27;re &quot;backfilling&quot; photos seems like it could be significantly more complex.<p>In essence when scrolling &quot;up&quot; we&#x27;d have to reverse the alignment and fill photos in from right to left.

You know, the big picture type stuff.<p>So, in my opinion, to fully understand functional programming, you need to think about what it tries to do/solve. To get here I would recommend thinking about insanely complex systems and how you would build a flexible and efficient one. To start you may think about all the objects you would need to account for, which, eventually, causes insanity. Its not the objects in the system that causes the complexity, it&#x27;s their interactions. So, you may start thinking about handling all of the interactions, which is where, I believe, the solution (really method is the better word) lies.<p>I believe then, that the key to understanding functional programming is to understand what its related concepts are able to solve. Thinking about how to make sense of and control this shitstorm of complexity will, hopefully, shed light on why the hell something called an &quot;applicative functor&quot; or, <insert other crazy/weird term> even exists.<p>I know, I know, I am being too general... the stuff comes from category theory though, so, uh, hard not to be... but seriously, if this is at all helpful and not totally incorrect, I&#x27;d be happy to expand in more detail<p>if, on the other hand, it is not helpful... forget it totally, learn a language, and hopefully the concepts follow\nelse if, I am totally incorrect... why and where did it all go so wrong?\nelse, nop",1405033786

I see the claim of &quot;you can write a macro to do it&quot; for any imaginable feature <i>all the time</i>, but it is simply not true.<p>A recent example from personal use is continuations. Scheme has them as a first-class object. Common Lisp does not, but a common claim is that you can write macros to provide continuations. Some people have: there&#x27;s &quot;cl-cont&quot; available on Quicklisp, which is a macro that will code-walk your functions to turn them into continuation-passing style and thus allow you to use continuations in those functions.<p>So that&#x27;s great, right? Common Lisp now totally has continuations? Not at all. In order to get this feature, you need to wrap <i>ahead of time</i> (specifically, at compile time) the functions you want to be continuable, and all of their callers, in this macro. You cannot simply use a function that you&#x27;ve been given as part of a continuation, it had to have been compiled under this macro.<p>That&#x27;s where the power of macros completely falls down and, in my opinion, gets completely overblown. Yes, your language is extendable, but your extensions are limited to computation and source-to-source transformation at compile time.

In my experience, I&#x27;ve seen how that can build into real resentment over time, but of course they can&#x27;t leave until they&#x27;ve vested, so they&#x27;re just stuck doing all the work and getting compensated well, but no where close to they might deserve or what the founders end up with.<p>Employees, early or not, have absolutely zero input into what investments founders decide to take. It&#x27;s also possible that employees may join before a start-up gets an investment from this fund, making the (potential) screwed-overness even worse. Employees can get as mad about this as they want, but they&#x27;ll have pretty much zero recourse in any situation.",1405033493

Clearly the knowledge that &quot;I have to stop&quot; isn&#x27;t having its desired effect. So who exactly are you worried about not complying with a relaxed standard?<p>Surely not the cautious people who stop at the Muni tracks on Church and Duboce while a torrent of riders streams past them across the middle of the intersection. The cautious ones already have enough common sense to observe the laws of physics.<p>Surely not the people whose goal is never to dab (put a foot down) between SoMa and Outer Richmond. They don&#x27;t care much for stop signs -- or red lights, or lanes, or the product of mass times velocity.<p>So is there really a constituency of borderline nut jobs who currently observe stop signs but would suddenly turn into reckless maniacs on two wheels if yielding were &quot;legalized&quot;? I&#x27;m probably in this camp and I can tell you that I already roll through the Wiggle when the coast is clear...and assuming a car hasn&#x27;t already waved me through.

There&#x27;s a definite downward trend in speedup as you increase vector size, and that is completely different from what you would naively expect (at larger vector sizes, you spend more time in the embarrassingly-parallelizable kernel)--so this suggests that the baseline itself is not scalar code but vector code.<p>So what the graphs end up highlighting is that the CPython (NumPy?) has decent overhead on tiny calls that don&#x27;t really matter for gross performance. As you say, 128 elements is tiny: that&#x27;s where I&#x27;d consider starting a graph, not ending it. At 4 elements, you&#x27;re looking at about 40 clock cycles to do a simple vector-add in the scalar case (I think x86 L1 cache hits are ~3 clock cycles and there are two load/store units; if these numbers are wrong, my estimate is off). This also means that there&#x27;s absolutely no measurement of the overhead of the JIT autovectorizing operation (!), which is quite significant because the usual resistance to adding autovectorizers in JITs [1] is that they&#x27;re way too slow for the speedup they give.<p>[1] As far as I&#x27;m aware, the only other JIT of note that includes an autovectorizer is the Hotspot JVM. The approach taken by other people (e.g., .NET CLR) is to effectively expose a SIMD primitive in the bytecode and get compilers to target those via static autovectorization instead of autovectorizing at runtime.",1445405518

I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find many people in the military who think &#x27;oh I&#x27;m already killing this guy with the AK74 who&#x27;s shooting at my buddies, I might as well shoot the pregnant woman with the 3-year old on her arm as well, just to be safe&#x27;.<p>I don&#x27;t know about operations procedures, but I would imagine it&#x27;s standard procedure to take out any armed people in the vicinity of your target. With drones you can&#x27;t really just stun them or whatever, so yeah you have to kill them. But those aren&#x27;t &#x27;innocent bystanders&#x27;. They&#x27;re enemy combatants in all meanings of the concept, and &#x27;fair game&#x27; (sorry again if that sounds callous again).<p>Furthermore, I think it&#x27;s easy but simplistic to say &#x27;all these soldiers are remorseless killing machines&#x27;, neither for on-the-ground troops, drone operators or generals who take the high level decisions. I think all of them have thought and think much more and harder about what it means to kill a person, and the fact that most of them in some form or another assist in killing people &#x27;by accident&#x27;, than you or I do. I also think that for the vast majority of them, this is a major psychological burden, something that literally haunts them at night. Yet they do what they do despite that, and I don&#x27;t think that the majority of them do it because they&#x27;re sadistic subhumans who get off on the idea of making children in an already bad situation on the other side of the world orphans.<p>So, if we can get past the &#x27;killing people with drones is immoral no matter what&#x27; rhetoric, we can come back to the real question: what is the effect of drone usage on warfare, and more to the point of the OP, is the implied claim that 90% of drone killings are of innocent civilians accurate?

82367,comment,81976,82117,0,0,mxh,,,"... but, aside from the higher tool cost, slower development time, and more expensive hosting, it's great?<p>I don't think performance is really a reason to pick the MSFT stack; MySpace does use it, proving that it <i>can</i> scale, but there are many more cases of web-scale systems built on open-source tech.  So that's, at best, a push.<p>It is easier to find warm bodies for a MSFT shop than, say, a Python shop.  But, as a startup, are you looking for 5 great guys, or 50 mediocre ones?  And do you really think it's easier to find 5 <i>great</i> MSFT guys than 5 great Python (or Ruby, or Java, or even LISP/Haskell/Erlang) guys?<p>The last point seems debatable to me, the others, less so.",1195624177

82365,comment,81976,82130,0,0,mxh,,,"I agree with this sentiment, and would add a few (somewhat) related reasons.<p>a.) 'Planet Microsoft'.  By this, I mean the gravitational pull all MSFT products seem to exert on one another, apparently by design and decree of the marketing department.  With open-source stuff, it seems like I can mix-n-match components pretty freely.  I can use Django on BSD, or Linux.  With MySQL, or PostgreSQL.  I can use its built-in templating, or not.  With MSFT, it seems like I'd better be using Win2K3+SQL2K5+IIS6+ASP.NET or I'm taking my life in my hands.  (And, when upgrade time comes, I better upgrade 'em <i>all</i>, or I'll have problems.  And I better upgrade <i>every</i> system or they won't talk to each other.)  Presumably MSFT could make its products more standalone, but prefers not to.<p>b.) Inevitable screwage.  I believe MSFT's goal is to establish itself as an unavoidable presence in the IT business (ala the bad old days of DOS) and then use that position to demand money.  For the moment, thanks to open standards, they can't do that.  I'm not interested in helping them change that by using/endorsing their technology stack.<p>c.) MSFT MVPs.  More generally, MSFT people.  With all due respect to any Planet Microsoft hackers hereabouts, there is an <i>enormous</i> lack of perspective found in people who've only used MSFT tools; they tend to think 'One Microsoft Way' is a viable approach to building code, and not just an address.  If you're reading this, and that offends you, I hereby acknowledge that there are exceptions, and you're probably one.  I don't want to flame anyone, I just want to share an honest reason why I'd prefer to avoid the MSFT stack.",1195623597

Users can choose between several authoring tools - called ""Spaces"" - that allow web users to annotate, modify and shift the content of a page and through ShiftSpace, share that shift with the rest of the web. ""Trails"" are maps of shifts (shiftspace content) that create meta-layer navigation across websites. These trails might be used as a platform for collaborative research, for curating net art exhibitions, or as a way to facilitate a context-based public debate.""",1195623546

The things animals do in the wild are much more fascinating especially when you consider techniques that humans do not grasp.<p>The video is interesting but misleading. I would highly doubt that the elephant has a clue as to what it's painting. Elephants have an incredible memory and amazing dexterity, those two things coupled together makes it likely that the elephant is painting from memory. The elephant also demonstrates some advanced painting skills that i'm sure it was taught. I would be more impressed of some cave paintings done in wild naturally by animals.<p>That being said, it's still a pretty neat video.",1206876367

There are ways to compete, independent of pricing strategy (e.g. all webmail is free, so the best product wins).<p>If Roovno is a service that can generate revenue for users while they use free web services, you're very much a part of the Freeconomy. In fact, you're betting on $0.00 being the future of business. lol.",1206875991

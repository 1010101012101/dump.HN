2. Eat nothing that is delicious ever again.
3. Statistically, not significantly prolong your life. You could still die of heart disease at 50 because your genes are just not good genes. You could get cancer and keel. You could sleep an hour to long, and throw a clot and die. 
4. Some people feel better in general doing the above 3 steps.<p>I am overweight, by a fair margin. But I'm not especially unhappy, insecure, or immobile. I have plenty of hobbies that involve outdoor things and my lifestyle doesn't inhibit those.

But the fact that there is only one model to the second order axioms of arithmetic (Peano's axioms with induction included) is a bit surprising to me.<p>We can't come up with a computable system for finding all mathematical truth but there appears to be a hardwired number system in the universe.  It's not computable but it is unique.  The natural numbers lead naturally (no pun intended) to the integers in a unique way.  The integers uniquely lead to the rationals and the completion of the rationals is a unique object called the real numbers.  The unique algebraic closure of the reals is the complex numbers.  There is uniqueness at each step.

Maybe ""moving average of 100 years"" or whatever (I don't know).<p>""However, there are an infinite number of points""<p>Not sure what you are saying? Seems to me a finite sample should be sufficient to get a statistical significant result. Are you saying ""OK, the measurement at point x was 30°C, but how can you be sure that 1m north of it the temperature was not -10°C""? I think that would be a bit silly. Again, the average should be your friend. Maybe at some measuring spots you miss the temperature by 10°C. So what? On average, those errors should cancel out.<p>""Still, there are an enormous number of points at which you need to measure temperature.""<p>As I said, I am not interested in the way to get there, just in the final information upon which to act or not. And that is one bit.<p>(Edit: although I also dispute your claim that there is an enormous number of points. To make up an extreme counter example, suppose you measure temperature in your home, and you notice it rising 10°C every year - would you really need other measurements to conclude that something is wrong? Like when it was at 100°C, boiling temperature for water, would you still say ""but OK, it is still reasonably chilly at 80km altitude, so nothing to worry about""?).<p>""Last but not least: the atmosphere is some 80 Km thick. You need measurement at high-altitudes, too.""<p>Again, I assume that climate researchers pick meaningful spots to measure. Maybe they measure at 80km altitude, maybe not. Maybe it is relevant to measure at 80km, maybe not. I don't see a point to argue about that kind of thing on a ""popular science"" level - that is up to the specialists. I suppose temperatures at 80km could be measured, why not? Maybe it can be done with telescopes or satellites - why do you assume it is not being done?<p>It just seems like a cop out to say ""yeah, but it is so complicated we can never be sure"".

Dismissing Archimedes' principle simply as ""boats that float in water float in water"" seems rather ingenuous.<p>Archimedes' principle says that the weight of water displaced by a floating object equals the weight of the object.

Modern programming is all about abstracting away detail to allow the programmer to concentrate on the structure and other stuff that matters, but it seems to me (and I may be wrong) that increasingly we find things that look the same, get used the same, generally behave the same, and then are different in a corner case.<p>It seems that allowing lists and generators to be used in identical ways generally makes things easier to create and easier to use, but the differences in the corner cases suddenly mean you have to know about the detail.

The problem is that details you need to know are being hidden, because you shouldn't need to know about them.<p>When I write a routine should I always ""assert"" that its parameter is a list and not a generator?

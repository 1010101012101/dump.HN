1112920,comment,1111547,1112362,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"rfghjhbg said it best. They did attract a few big businesses. Microsoft Canada has their headquarters (I believe that's what it is) in Mississauga. But they did so with the lure of unsustainably low taxes on these businesses. What's worse is that for the most part, there's not enough work in Mississauga itself to sustain its population. So a huge percentage of its population works in Toronto and surrounding cities.<p>Fundamentally, Mississauga depends heavily on Toronto for the jobs of its population as the manufacturing businesses it attracted are hurting right now and never could sustain the huge population.<p>I don't want to make it sound like I'm bashing Mississauga. Toronto created this phenomenon of commuter ghettos by ignoring the living needs of middle class families through most of the 1980s and 1990s. Toronto also let just enough businesses escape to these outer suburbs through high taxes, to make it seem like a feasible option to move out there. So people did, but most of the jobs that a professional who lives in these communities works at are still in Toronto itself.<p>For the most part the only thing keeping downtown Toronto itself from being a mess is that it's the financial hub for Canada. This sphere of influence is not necessarily permanent though and I worry about this city a lot. Alberta is where a lot of the resources are and it would make sense for the financial sector to be there. We like to poke fun of Albertans because they have all their eggs in the oil basket. But right now Toronto has all its eggs in the banking basket. It's a very fragile proposition.",1265741980

1112903,comment,1112439,1112752,0,0,sliverstorm,,,"> Knowing human nature, this is understandable - there's a tendency to think that once a ""fight"" has been won, it should stay won. But it's also disturbing: does this tendency cause people to actively want to imprison innocent people?<p>It's not that they want to imprison innocents; it's a prosecutor's job to get the defendant convicted no matter what, whether or not they personally believe the defendant is guilty.  They are simply acting as their job calls for (the conflicting prosecution and defense attorneys in theory bringing about the truth), because until now you could never be 100% sure.  '100% sure' and 'our legal system' do not go well together.<p>P.S. Don't invoke the argument over the ethically wrong claiming 'oh I was just doing my job'- this is different; we WANT the prosecutor to behave like that, even if he feels or even knows the defendant is innocent.

1112823,comment,1112536,1112536,0,0,NateLawson,,,"Chris Tarnovsky is amazing, a true prodigy. Unfortunately, he gets bad advice on how to present his work. TPMs are what the media latched onto but are almost irrelevant to his advances.<p>What Chris presented is a full break of the Infineon SLE66PE secure microcontroller, used in smart cards for applications such as pay TV. This is one of the best of the current generation of smart cards. All of them have a layer of metal mesh that allows the chip to detect probing attempts. This processor also has optical sensors below that mesh (defense in depth?) It has many other countermeasures to prevent invasive attacks.<p>Chris's work in this area is astounding. He's now using a FIB whereas before he was just using microscopes and chemicals. This allows him to burn holes or deposit metal in the low tens of nanometers range. Combined with his old skills, this makes for a formiddable platform for defeating chip security measures.<p>His work on this chip is not easy, nor is it easily replicated. However, once someone with the resources and skills performs this kind of attack, it can enable much cheaper attacks later. For example, using this method to dump the ROM and then finding a software flaw in it would allow for attacks using ordinary PCs, no more physical manipulation needed. Or, you can build a jig (""drill here"") that lets it be replicated by less skilled people using microprobing needles and ordinary microscopes. This reduces the cost of subsequent attacks.<p>TPMs have a poor security model to begin with. The exposed wires on the LPC bus (4 x 16 mhz) can be used to MITM it. The entire design is not meant to resist even board-level attacks, let alone invasive chip work. Claiming his talk is about TPMs is like saying cryptanalysis of SHA-1 is about breaking Django authentication. Sure it does, but there are much more important affected applications.<p>I actually think this validates the SLE66PE design. The fact that it required this much work gives me much more confidence about using it. Hopefully Infineon uses the information from Chris's talk to improve the next generations.",1265739926

What they do in terms of scalability makes Google's operations look like child's play.  They are web UI design leaders, and they keep rolling out changes at an amazing pace (they push significant changes multiple times per week).  The interface is cluttered yes, but it's cluttered in the same way Photoshop's UI is cluttered, that is it caters to the needs of heavy users.<p>It's okay and maybe even a moral obligation to hate Facebook for its time-wasting banality, but don't hate them for being good at what they do.  Claiming it's all luck is like some kind of playground taunt; their operations blow the vast majority of tech companies out of the water (look at how they ran circles around Twitter).  It's good discipline to recognize greatness in companies you don't like, and Facebook has a lot of important lessons for any tech startup.",1265738873

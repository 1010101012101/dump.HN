2649180,comment,2648720,2648720,6,0,cletus,,,"I see 5 problems:<p>1. An offer for ""Pay $X for $Y of Z"" have at least anecdotally led to people spending $X+(small number) where a lot of those who offer such deals are expecting more (the Gap was a notable example of this). Perhaps a better model is a capped percentage discount on the bill?<p>2. Evolving social etiquette of tipping. It may simply be that people are unaware that the right thing to do is probably to tip on the undiscounted price. Or it may simply be that those who are inclined to use Groupons are simply cheap. I expect it's a little of both;<p>3. No caps on offers is a big problem. It means businesses can't budget what are basically marketing expenses. For this to work you need to be able to track individual offers (so a person can't use the same offer twice). This has the added advantage of you being able to mine this data as you know who used an offer, when they did, what they spent, what other offers they've taken and so on;<p>4. Businesses seem to resent people using these coupons. This I don't get (other than the complaints of wait staff). It's a marketing expense. If a Coolhaus truck can sit a block away from my office in downtown Manhattan giving out free ice cream sandwiches for several days (raising awareness and creating a lot of good will) then you, as a business, owe yourself this: leave the customer happy. If they're unhappy you've just wasted your marketing spend on them; and<p>5. Having to ask for the offer upfront is BAD. It's awkward. It leads to at least the suspicion of getting smaller portions or otherwise getting the cheap version. It probably means you'll get worse service. The offer should simply be X% off a bill (max value $Y). Exclude alcohol entirely.<p>Honestly I expect Groupon to sink into the ocean. Businesses don't seem to like it. Consumers are having mixed experiences. The early investors have been paid off with large F/G rounds. Revenue per customer is decreasing. What Groupon is doing isn't exactly rocket science. I kinda see small investors being left with the bill for all this post-IPO.<p>It's a shame really because I see such things as a great way to promote a restaurant (which is actually hard).",1307976498

Then again I didn't show it until it was time to pay (are you supposed to show it when you order?). It was a $15 coupon and we used it to cover part of a $50 tab for dessert and drinks.

There is lots of documentation about how to use the various unit testing libraries out there, but what's the easiest way to <i>run</i> all of your unit tests? In Perl, the Makefile generated from Makefile.PL (or Build script generated from Build.PL) has a 'test' command that will run tests that look like t/*.t (the pattern is actually more permissive than this, but I'm not sure what the specs are beyond that being the most common case). It will automatically setup the library paths to include the code, etc, so that you don't have to manually fool around with @INC (Perl's sys.path).<p>Is there something similar in setup.py? If so, how does it find which files have tests to run?<p>edit: So there really isn't a standard Python way to 'run all unit tests?'

I find it increasingly unsatisfying.<p>1. I have to cross-reference page numbers for every citation. When you're talking about hundreds of citations from dozens of sources, you come to regret not reading the originals in the first place. I don't see the day when citing Kindle locations becomes acceptable among the standardized citation guides (MLA, Chicago, etc.) since many users convert PDFs by themselves, and different settings (e.g. omitting introductory pages, dedication pages, title pages, etc.) mean different locations.<p>2. Annotations. Everyone tells me how easy it is to insert notes and highlight passages, but the currently available methods do not give me the same flexibility as a simple pen:<p>2A. Discontinuous highlighting/underlining. Sometimes I don't want to highlight every word in a particular passage, but Kindle does not allow me to do this; as soon as the highlight ends, the next highlight can only be treated as a completely new annotation.<p>2B. I can't draw. Arrows, lines, maps, even illustrations are an important part of my annotation process. On the bottom of one section of Plato's Meno, for example, I have about a half a dozen drawings trying to make sense of a particularly interesting geometry problem (about which several papers have been published) [1]<p>2C. Multiple language/character support. This is a particularly difficult issue when dealing with translations. Even if I'm not reading a Greek text, I may be on-the-fly translating between English, French, German, and Greek (often 3 or even 4 of the above within the same paper!). As such, quite a few of my notes are in Greek, and so you can imagine my disappointment with the Kindle.<p>3. Jumping between passages is difficult. Sure, I can search the text - but I guarantee that's actually <i>slower</i> than flipping through pages. And if I direct students to a particular passage? That one kid using a Kindle in the corner of the room is still looking for it by the time we have moved on.<p>These are not all just Kindle problems, they're obstacles that eBooks and their complimentary software have to overcome to actually obsolete the physical book. I don't mean to suggest that these issues can't be overcome [2], but I believe the paperless revolution is much further away than some like to believe.<p>For the small amount of for-pleasure-not-work fiction that I consume, I'm probably not going back to paper.<p>[1] <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/jholbo/writings/dialogues/meno/meno9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepage.mac.com/jholbo/writings/dialogues/meno/meno9...</a><p>[2] No doubt the failure to adopt these features stems from low demand -- most of the demand in the industry is for popular literature, not the sort of people who are writing all sorts of things in the margins of their books.

If the LoC stores two copies of the same book in two geographically dispersed locations but makes the same brain-dead mistake in preservation process at both, then it doesn't matter that there were two copies. Entirely separate organizations using entirely separate methodologies are much safer than one organization.

The voucher did not explain that it could not be used before 7pm. It was 1 in the afternoon, I sat there regardless and continued to be ripped out (8.50 for a breakfast, cheapest thing on menu) and in total paid 40 for some dinner.<p>In terms of tipping, I generally leave a tip if around 10%, more if the person waiting is really good and a good personality, less if I think they are over acting it to get a higher tip. They don't get anything if the food is crap or over priced. I don't think I have been anywhere recently where I have not used a voucher or coupon, it's not because I am tight, it's simply because they are there. I don't consider myself a bad tipper either.<p>I know what you mean though about feeling bad about using vouchers or coupons, I feel slightly guilty about it.

I know personally I read most of my books on ebook, but on occasions I will go buy a book of an author I like and I know many people do the same as I do. Also the library of congress made it its goal to archive all the knowledge both to a giant database as well as in the paper form. So I feel the article is slightly off in that regard.",1307973719

A major factor to consider when optimising anything particularly something as generic as a large framework is that an optimisation for small scale situations can have a detrimental effect on larger ones (and vice-versa, though as problems are more noticeable on larger scales of size or complexity optimising for that at the expense of the smaller situations is the better over-all choice in many cases).",1307973615

687092,comment,686953,686953,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"A few random comments ...<p>Sports are something that require initial talent followed by hard work and dedication to reach the point where you can earn a sensible living.  However, some sports can be spectacles.  People can watch and appreciate the skill and excitement.  Getting large numbers of people watching can generate money, which can support the teams and players, and so talent/work/skill gets converted into money.<p>Engineering, math, science, etc., are something that require initial talent followed by hard work and dedication to reach the point where you can earn a sensible living.  Turning them into a spectacle seems unlikely.  Hence they will never generate mass appeal, or money from popularisation.  People will never watch a scientist at work and appreciate the skill, and so will never, by that route, aspire to be a scientist (mathematician, engineer, hacker, physicist, etc).<p>All people know of science, and math in particular, is that it's hard, and they can't see the point.  With sports they can see the potential for adulation, and enormous sums of money.  Hence the ""youth of today"" aspire to be sports stars.  Or celebrities.<p>Where are the celebrity geeks?<p>I have, and on occasion wear with pride, a ""Nerd Pride"" badge given to me by Gerald Jay Sussman.  Maybe we should all be proud to say we're geeks/nerds/hackers/engineers and wear such labels with confidence.<p>For reference, Ron Graham worked his way through graduate school by performing in a circus with a trampoline troupe. Bela Bollobas represented Oxford University at modern pentathlon, and Cambridge University at fencing. Paul erdos was astonishingly good at table tennis, and these are not isolated examples.  Many distinguished scientists and mathematicians are extremely good at sports.",1246708451

687081,comment,686829,686829,0,0,subtra,,,"Subtractive design is an expected-but-unintentional occurrence if the project is running over scope. And the stuff that is subtracted is dependent on the size and status of the project. Big budget games will typically cut large swathes of content and some of the less-critical features. Small budget games may end up gutting the entire concept in favor of whatever gets some gameplay with the available assets and tech.<p>It is a meme, almost a cliche, for designers to battle programmers over the quantity of features in the game, because more features (usually) allow more gameplay. There's a lot of inertia to avoid cuts if possible; a cut is viewed as ""wasted effort,"" and each one potentially violates the interests of stakeholders.<p>On the other hand, if you view games as being like other art forms, it's not uncommon for other mediums to overproduce and then cut to reach the final product: Pop songs are cut to about 3 minutes, and movies get cut to about 90 minutes. Big budget games have been steered towards shorter length recently, but this is done mostly because it costs too much to produce 40+ hour games at the current quality bar, not because of a move towards ""cut to perfection"" methodology.",1246706504

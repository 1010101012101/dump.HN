Step one, network, then don't be afraid to be too picky about who you approach to join you.",1184126169
33604,comment,33558,33602,0,0,jey,,,"There are no dinners after the Founders Program. There are some other invitation-only events like the reception on the night before Startup School, but I <i>assume</i> that employees of YC companies will <i>most of the time</i> be allowed to attend these events. As Paul said in another post, ""There's no rule one way or the other. So far there hasn't had to be, because none of them have that many employees. I doubt it will ever be enough of an issue that we have to think about it.""",1184125803

The data is not directly available to the general public and access often must be negotiated with individual airlines [...] A large portion of the flight, price and seat availability data, called published data, is used by all the major search engines, but a significant amount of private data is restricted.""",1184125589

On the other hand, I can understand why Apple wanted so much control over the launch as they want to sell the user a complete experience, not just a gadget.  <p>Letting Verizon handle sales would have been a bad idea - they're not very good at selling phones - I haven't enjoyed having to go and buy them at the Verizon stores in the past.<p>Letting Verizon handle support would have been less problematic, they've been great with my blackberry support, always overnighting me a new one no questions asked the same day (happened 3 times).  Of course having people have to buy them at the Apple store gets people looking at Macs etc,so the motivation for Apple is pretty clear.<p>The big question is whether running on a lesser network will lose them so many customers that demanding the super deal with AT&T was a mistake.  Time will tell once the clones arrive.",1184125428
33600,comment,33316,33583,0,0,staunch,,,"<i>""All else being equal, for new development, Postgres is the better answer...""</i><p>That's very thinly disguised dogma. Whatever the question, Postgres is the answer.<p>It doesn't bother me though, I'm used to seeing people choose one camp over the other. I just wanted to point out that I use both for different things and it's served me very well. The MySQL vs Postgres discussion itself is unbelievably boring.

33598,comment,33410,33568,0,0,pg,,,"Not all the founders have to be hackers. You just need at least one person who can hack, and at least one person who can deal with people (including investors and customers). <p>Three kinds of design ability are needed: product design (what does it do?); software design (how does it do it?); and graphic design (what does the site look like?).  Somehow between them the founders have to cover the first two.  Graphic designers can be hired, though it's better if the founders can do that too.<p>The ideal configuration would of course be a group where all the founders had all these skills.  Haven't seen that yet, though.",1184124429

In that case, yes, you get to go to the dinners.<p>1. The Founders Program is the 3 month program that YC runs.",1184123492

There's so much non-hacking stuff to do that I honestly think each group should have someone who feels no compulsion to write code, freeing the hacker(s) from distraction. <p>My ideal candidate, were I doing the funding, would be a group consisting of two hackers and one non-hacker. Maybe I'm biased though because that's what we have.<p>

You'll do better with enthusiasm but no experience than with experience but no enthusiasm.  Most of the big success stories have junky back-ends anyway (Flickr is PHP; YouTube's player can't skip forward; MySpace is a pile o' tinker toys and duct tape).  A tin can that does something beats a perfect blueprint that just sits there.<p>Oh, and the point of college, actually, is tagging co-eds.  Comp. Sci majors tend not to realize this at the time.<p>And human biological feedback loops ensure that stays interesting.  Hacking doesn't, so do it while you still find it novel and exciting!

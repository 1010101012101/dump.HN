It cheapens all other real threats to free speech.<p>If you like propaganda that justifies pirating, keep reading the Torrent freak blog with their red herrings like censorship and their ""battle for free speech"".<p>Microsoft is exercising their rights just like we get to exercise ours. It's a private company offering you free software (as in no money exchanged) and they don't want to let you share torrent files and for good damn reason. I'd do that too if I were Microsoft!<p>Anyone who claims the Pirate Bay is a place to share cool new media that's released for free is just kidding themselves. Look at their most popular downloads. It's primarily all copyrighted music, movies, and software that are being shared without the owner's consent. Sure, there are a decent number of artists sharing their work via TPB and the Pirate Bay do a lot of promoting of that stuff. But make no mistake, the majority of people are just downloading a bunch of free, copyrighted work.<p>It would be censorship if Live Messenger were the only or one of few viable options for IM but that's far from being the case. I sincerely doubt Microsoft cares about you downloading albums for free. They just don't want you sharing Windows 8 over their app (when it finally ships, that is) that's all.<p>Is that not a legitimate concern? To try to stop people from getting your product without paying you? That's reasonable. They put a ton of time and money into developing software and they don't do it for their health. Just because it's digital and takes zero effort to copy doesn't mean that after the first copy is sold everything else should be up for grabs.<p>Whenever the torrent people start yammering about censorship and free speech and try to sound all hip, smart, and progressive, it's just a distraction. It's really about continuing to operate while ignoring IP laws. Whether you think copyright is okay or not is irrelevant because the laws are on the books and enforced. If all you do in protest of those laws is pirate music and movies you're really just creating more problems for yourself. Piracy alone as a protest only creates more censorship and restrictions of free speech as Torrent Freak would call it. If you really believe in all those nice sounding ideals you have to get up from behind your monitor and write a letter, make a phone call, or actually show up somewhere and do something.<p>This article was downright laughable. This is just a PR war and damn easy one to win too. It's easy to hate ""big evil corporations"" and to love getting shit free with little to no effort needed.",1332636998

3751330,comment,3750857,3751230,10,0,kijin,,,"The model you're talking about also sounds similar to the Intense World Theory [1] of autism. It says that an autistic brain tries to process more details about the world around them than a typical brain does, and therefore gets easily overwhelmed when there's too much information to process. Autism, of course, is not exactly the same as introversion (autistic people usually don't get social cues), but the theory seems to have some commonalities with the idea you're describing.<p>Saturation is exactly how I'd describe interacting with a large number of people at the same time, too. I feel like an app server that's suddenly getting hammered with more simultaneous requests than I can handle.

IE, it's less about the social aspect and more about being able to process stimuli in general. It's just that social gatherings tend to provide a lot more stimuli (people are complicated!)<p>In this model, an introverted person is simply a person that becomes saturated much more easily; and the reason they dislike crowds and other large gatherings is just because the amount of possible inputs are tremendous and need to be kept track of. An extroverted person might feel more comfortable in these situations, either because they can process more stimuli, or more likely in my opinion, because they're less sensitive to those stimuli. (I don't think it's a coincidence that a lot of the introverted people I know tend to pick up on subtle social cues a lot more readily than extroverts, and also tend to emit more subtle cues).<p>As a person that's probably moderately introverted, thinking of it in terms of ""saturation"" feels more natural to me. If I'm in a large group I don't so much feel a loss of energy (unless I'm trying hard to be extra friendly); if anything, when I reach a saturation point I'm at a higher energy level, I'm just sort of ""full"".<p>I wish I could remember where I first read about this way of thinking about it though and give some sources.",1332634139

Diamond inheritance in Go means you have physical nesting like [D [C [A]] [B [A]]] so necessarily the A's will clash, but you can override their methods and manually resolve it - yeah, at the cost of a delegating call (which the compiler could probably strip out).<p>Interfaces subsume the feature of traits to define an operation abstractly against the methods of its operand without defining its representation.

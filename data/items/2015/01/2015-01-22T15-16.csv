Take the time to fix it to improve things for you and for your team.<p>Obviously there is a huge range of appropriate responses, but I think keeping this sort of understanding is important. A problem that you identify is a problem in something that at least touches your team&#x27;s primary responsibility.",1421942341
8929808,comment,8928962,8929672,0,0,briandear,,,"I am not sure how you can make the statement that higher minimum wages don&#x27;t equate to job losses. Do you have proof? It&#x27;s common sense that if you wage the price of something you buy less of it. Unfortunately for the poor, minimum wage jobs are rather elastic. In France, with a relatively high minimum wage, unemployment is double digits and places like McDonald&#x27;s have gone to digital order machines as opposed to hiring more cashiers. While that might increase demand for computer machine manufacturing and services, the minimum wage students and unskilled persons aren&#x27;t likely to have the skills needed to gain those jobs.<p>You also have the chronically unemployed in both the U.S. as well as places like France where it&#x27;s livable to simply collect the government check.<p>Minimum wage shouldn&#x27;t be a career. I have little sympathy for those who haves worked minimum wage for ten years or more. That suggests a lack of ambition, intelligence or both. Even the pimple faced 16 year old at Chick fil&#x27;a eventually gets promoted to team leader potentially in a matter of months or a year. Those who have worked minimum wage for 5 years or more, I&#x27;d be very interested in their work history, their criminal record, their tardiness, their productivity.<p>At a place like McDonalds, if you just show up on time consistently, you get raises. If you&#x27;re a hard worker and express the desire there are plenty of assistant manager trainee tracks available.<p>Raising minimum wage isn&#x27;t the answer -- taking away the incentive to be lazy would do more than throwing people an extra $2 per hour. The same bad decisions that got them in that situation are still the same bad decisions that they will keep making; unless there is incentive to stop.<p>Someone right now could go to North Dakota and get a job doing local truck deliveries paying up to $100k per year, some positions will even train. Working in the oil patch down in Texas and Louisiana offers high paying entry level positions that quickly end up paying over $100k.<p>My point is that there is always a way out of a minimum wage existence, the problem is that many people are content getting their free Medicaid, EBT cards and subsidized housing; so there is less incentive to move across the country or take a class somewhere or join a union apprentice program.<p>I am not saying end welfare or anything like that, but a safety net ought not become a way of life as it has for millions of people.",1421942326

It has a tube coming off the engine, through a butterfly valve, then into the firewall of the car. The butterfly valve opens when the engine is under high load, so that the car is quiet normally, and loud if you get on it (inside).<p>I really enjoy this feature, and have actually redirected the tubes past the valve so that the sound is always on 100% of the time.

No matter how often the prediction is wrong, new ones are made and the failure of the appearance of hyperinflation on schedule is ignored or handwaved away with vague declarations about how the government is conspiring to hide inflation, or the Fed is using some kind of temporary monetary/balance-sheet magic trick, or as soon as the economy starts up again we&#x27;re all <i>doomed</i>.<p>What I have never understood is why computer-technical types so often participate in this kind of thinking when we&#x27;re usually pretty good on other sciences.

At the end of this year I pay the loan back in full at $1030.00. I have spent a larger nominal value, however the real value of the loan is now $1030.00 * 0.98 = $1009.40. Meaning my effective interest rate was around 1%.<p>Borrowing - Deflation: Let&#x27;s take the same numbers, but now it&#x27;s 2% deflation. I pay back the loan, $1030.00 nominal value. The real value is $1030.00 * 1.02 = $1050.60. My effective interest rate is around 5%.<p>Salary - Inflation: I am paid $100,000 this year for my work, inflation rate of 2%. Without a pay raise my nominal salary remains the same next year, but my real salary becomes $98,000. This is a pro for employers, I am a cheaper employee.

Without a pay raise my nominal salary remains the same next year, but my real salary becomes $102,000. This is the reverse. I cost my employer more, but without changing nominal salaries my time has become more valuable.<p>Purchasing - Inflation: You want a widget worth $1000.00 today and face 2% inflation. If you purchase it at the start of the year, ignoring depreciation on the widget, it&#x27;s worth $1020.00 at the end of the year. So if you resell it at that point you&#x27;ve made 2% (nominal), though the real value is the same.<p>Purchasing - Deflation: Using the same widget, price and 2% deflation. If you purchase it at the start of the year for $1000.00, and sell at the end for $980.00 you end with the same real value, but you&#x27;ve lost 2% of the nominal value. Barring a need to purchase an item within a particular time, it makes sense for purchasers to delay purchasing as long as possible. On the other hand, vendors want to sell as early as possible because the nominal value of their goods are decreasing (and this ignores other costs of holding inventory).",1421940299

The CDC tries to manage diseases once local authorities become overwhelmed.  They maintain the Strategic National Stockpile.  The SNS is a stockpile of different drugs, not enough for everyone, but enough to hopefully contain an outbreak.  Our particular vaccine was FDA approved, and purchased for the SNS.  The CDC also may purchase drugs that have not yet been FDA approved (depending on the political climate).<p>The FDA is the regulatory agency that polices, in this article&#x27;s case, drugs.  They monitor the clinical trials, and manufacturing process of the drugs (gmp-good manufacturing process).  The FDA makes sure that drug companies do not exaggerate the efficacy of their products.<p>So it is not really that surprising that an agency that monitors and manages diseases would recommend drugs, while the agency that monitors and manages drugs would point to drug efficacy first.",1421939840

Obviously, less lending is bad for the banks, but I fail to see how it would be bad for the consumer if they actually saved up money and paid cash for a car. Although I do understand why lending is important for starting a business; it would be hard in many markets to save enough capital to get off the ground. I&#x27;m talking about small stuff, like housing, cars, TVs.<p>I have little to no economics knowledge, but it does seem to me that this pervasive, cultural thinking that we <i>need this now</i> is the source of many problems. I know some retailers like Ford even attempted to curb the practice of buying on credit, but ultimately caved to pressure from customers wanting to live above their means.<p>So, can you explain, in a way that doesn&#x27;t involve trickle-down economics, how borrowing money is a net gain for consumers?

I don’t think it’s too much of a jump to think that if the price of something is going to go down next week, people are more likely to hold off on purchases.<p>Though I imagine a bigger issue is the need for investment. When there’s stagnation firms tend to sit on a lot of cash, because they believe that money slowly losing value (low inflation) or even gaining value (deflation) is preferable to the few and possibly risky investment opportunities they see. This causes credit and investments to dry up. This hording behavior, as well as the wage inflexibility mentioned above, ends up being a major drag on the economy. On the other hand, with a decent rate of inflation firms are going to be making sure that their money is working, because if it’s just sitting there it’s going to be losing money year after year.",1421939109

For end-user apps: offline maps support. Google Maps has it as app (and not everywhere), we provide SDK where it works globally. For more demanding needs you can add 3D objects to map, use it for HUD navigation (Google terms prohibit it), use completely own/custom base map etc. See <a href=""https://www.nutiteq.com/nutiteq-sdk/comparison/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nutiteq.com/nutiteq-sdk/comparison/</a> for more more differences and similarities",1421939087

For instance, a language like Javascript, or PHP, give great flexibility about layout, so in those languages I can see each developer having a unique style (and I have been involved in style debates regarding those languages), however, a language like Python has a fairly fixed layout, since the whitespace is significant. And also, in Clojure, I think most programmers use Emacs and accept the Emacs clojure-mode indenting as the default.<p>Variable name choices is another where some environments encourage similarity, and others allow for unpredictability and unique styles. Within the Ruby On Rails framework, for instance, there are norms about the creation of variable names.<p>I would guess that syntactic features is perhaps the one characteristic that shows a great deal of uniqueness in every language.

10140388,comment,10139554,10139554,0,0,cousin_it,,,"So, matrices are a convenient way to write down linear transformations. But then the student might ask, why study linear transformations at all? Just because they have nice properties? Why this particular set of nice properties, and not some other set? As a rule of thumb, a good math explanation shouldn&#x27;t start with axioms and claim that they are &quot;nice&quot;. First give some intuitive examples, and only then say which axioms they satisfy.<p>For linear transformations, one possible avenue is start with the notion of <i>derivative</i>. If we take a real-valued function, its derivative at a particular point is just a single number, which represents the function&#x27;s rate of change. But what if we have a function that accepts, say, two real numbers and outputs three? It turns out that the natural generalization of &quot;derivative&quot; to such functions is a rectangular array of numbers:<p><pre><code>    dy1/dx1 dy1/dx2\n    dy2/dx1 dy2/dx2\n    dy3/dx1 dy3/dx2\n</code></pre>\nIf we know these numbers (and nothing else), we can linearly approximate the values of a function near a particular point, with at most quadratic error.<p>Now let&#x27;s say we have two functions. The first one takes two numbers and outputs three, and the second one takes three numbers and outputs four. If we compose them together, can we find the derivative of the composite from the two simpler derivatives by some kind of chain rule, like the one we have for ordinary real-valued functions? It turns out that yes, we can, if we replace the product of two numbers with the product of two matrices (defined in a particular way).<p>Now it&#x27;s easy to explain what linear transformations are. They are just multidimensional functions whose derivative (matrix) is the same at every point. They are just like one-dimensional linear functions, whose derivative (number) is the same at every point. (For convenience, people also say that every linear transformation must take the point (0,0,...) to the point (0,0,...), so that matrices correspond one-to-one to linear transformations and vice versa.)<p>If you want to work with linear transformations effortlessly, there&#x27;s a lot more intuition to develop, but this should serve for the basics.",1440863617

It is a power-user interface by all measure.<p>And while Microsoft does simplify UIs for end users, they don&#x27;t typically do the same for administrative content (just look at anything in the Admin Tools, or MMC snap-ins, no sugar coating there).<p>Your argument about backwards compatibility is at best confusing. What does the data stores utilised have to do with UI representations of the same? I can name numerous examples where things changed behind the scenes and the UI was just updated to support it (e.g. Disk Manager now supports ESP, and exFat, same UI, ConHost now supports Powershell, same UI, Defrag now supports Trim for SSDs, same UI, etc).<p>> So yeah there are two or more places where certificates are stored.

But his work did not show that antidepressants are clinically ineffective.<p>Dr. Kirsch&#x27;s analysis showed that for mild depression treated with antidepressants, there is in fact an improvement in symptoms of depression based on rating scales like the Hamilton Depression Scale - but for mild depression, this improvement in the numbers doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into what you correctly identify as <i>clinical</i> significance. However, Dr. Kirsch&#x27;s own &quot;cutoff&quot; for whether or not such a numerical increase constitutes &quot;clinical significance&quot; or not is itself just an arbitrary number that itself has been criticized.<p>Also, Kirsch&#x27;s own metaanalyses (and other metaanalyses) show clearly that for moderate and severe depression (and other conditions), antidepressants are indeed clinically effective (in other words, yes, the benefits actually &quot;mattered&quot; from a patient&#x27;s perspective), and, importantly, they are highly effective at preventing relapse.<p>They work, and work well.<p>In addition, there are a variety of reasons why many short-term clinical trials of antidepressants (which have made up the bulk of clinical trials of SSRIs, for example) are entirely different from the way physicians prescribe antidepressants (and other medications) clinically, and may underestimate their benefit even for cases of mild depression. The beneficial effects of antidepressants increase with longer exposure (i.e. exceeding the length of a six week clinical drug study), probably because of downstream neurotrophic factor(s) increases. Many trials of antidepressants limited dose adjustment or dose adjustment rate. Many clinical trials have excluded patients with severe symptoms or dual diagnoses because inclusion introduces a safety issue or may introduce too many variables. Also, physicians will switch patients to another antidepressant if there is no sign of early efficacy, and while one antidepressant may work very well (probably as a result of genetics), another will not work at all. Most studies focusing on one drug are not going to switch to another medication in the same class (for example, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) during the trial, even though that&#x27;s routinely done in clinical practice with good result.<p>Antidepressants work. Psychotherapy can also be helpful as a sole treatment for mild depression (although please note that psychotherapy has its own set of risks, costs, and drawbacks), and patients often get additional benefit by engaging in psychotherapy along with medication treatment. However, a psychologist or counselor treating a moderately to severely depressed person who fails to refer that patient for evaluation for treatment with an antidepressant would be risking a malpractice suit.",1440863132

We&#x27;re all subject to it, but most of us carry it well enough to know when to shut up.<p>In this iteration, the rich complain that their former problems have been solved, but have been replaced by other problems as a result of solving those initial problems. It is a fallacy to assume that these new problems are of the same magnitude of the other problems, and they really should not be treated with the same set of thoughts. The problems of emotional awkwardness with newfound vast wealth are not the same magnitude as the problems of building a company, and those are not the same magnitude as overcoming past emotional abuse, or struggling to feed your family, or trying to avert emergently approaching death. See how I&#x27;ve captured several logs of magnitude here?<p>The conflation of magnitude is what causes the negative reactions when rich people complain. They are complaining about things at the very top of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs. These are philosophical (academic/only relevant under very narrow circumstances) problems that are in all likelihood completely unsolvable by complaining to others. These are the kinds of problems that are solvable with critical introspection, discussion with close others, and discussion with professionals. You get no points for throwing yourself onto the pyre and wailing to the world-- there is tumblr for that, and it isn&#x27;t a realistic shot at solving the problems.<p>Anyways, a more direct response to your points:<p>1. I&#x27;ve been in this situation, and just ended it recently. There were no disconnects with old friends... I think you&#x27;d have to have shitty friends for this to be a problem.<p>2. Everyone already has ulterior motives and purposes for each other. Sometimes all you want from the other person is friendship, and if it&#x27;s a mutual feeling, it&#x27;s great. This is human nature-- everyone does want something from everyone else. The more you have, the more they want.<p>3. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a serious statement. This isn&#x27;t a problem on most people&#x27;s radars, and is really irrelevant because you mention that these people can pay others to deal with these problems for them. If the money is stressing you out, just ditch it... oh wait, you like it too much. Clam up and make do, or talk to a therapist-- one of the few people who will take this line of thought seriously.<p>4. Of course wealthy people can be miserable and wealth can be a burden, but the beauty of wealth is that you have far more resources to help you carry burdens.

(It also imposes the cost of two virtual memory context switches on every system call; I think i386 can do this cheaply with segment registers, but I&#x27;m not sure, and basically nothing else can.)<p>You could give user processes direct access to I/O devices so user processes can access them directly instead of through system calls, which might be sensible in an environment where you wrote all the processes.<p>You could <i>virtualize</i> the I/O devices, just as we virtualize memory, so that, for example, your gigabit network card copies packets directly into your memory space — but only if they’re <i>your</i> packets, not packets addressed to a different process.  (This was originally called &quot;VIA&quot; on Linux; I think it has a different name now.)<p>You could separate your processes through a trusted compiler, like Erlang does, instead of with hardware; an intermediate approach would use a trusted machine-code verifier, analogous to Java&#x27;s bytecode verifier, or a trusted machine-code rewriter that compiled unsafe machine code to safe machine code.<p>You could allow only a single thread per process, like Erlang does and like Unix did for many years, either with or without explicit shared-memory facilities like shmseg and mmap.<p>You could entirely decouple threads of control from memory spaces, as KeyKOS did (if you look at it funny; KeyKOS domains are an awful lot like single-threaded processes, but you could instead consider them to be locks).<p>You could make all memory write-once, eliminating many of the difficulties that attend sharing it (Umut Acar&#x27;s Self-Adjusting Computation paper is based on an abstract machine using this model) but probably requiring a global garbage collector.<p>You could replace the memory abstraction with a transactional store and execute transactions rather than continuous-time processes; the transactions could either be time-limited, as in CICS, or preemptively scheduled like processes, but in either case incapable of I/O or IPC.<p>So, considering the enormous design space of possibilities on even this single matter, Unix and Windows are huddled together in one tiny corner of the design space, as on many other design choices.  It&#x27;s clearly a better corner than many other possibilities that we&#x27;ve explored, especially on currently-popular hardware and with compatibility with the existing applications that bcantrill was deifying upthread.  But the design space is so big and multidimensional that it seems terribly unlikely that we&#x27;ve found an optimum.  We know that it has failed to ever produce a secure system against many plausible threat models, and that producing a hard-real-time system in it is possible but more difficult than with some alternative models.  We know shared-mutable-memory threading is terribly bug-prone.  We know that indirecting all I/O through the kernel imposes heavy performance costs, which adds complexity to user processes and adds the market barrier to high-performance I/O hardware like InfiniBand.  We know that processes separated by the use of virtual memory facilities are very heavyweight, so you can&#x27;t switch between them at more than a few hundred kilohertz on a single core, you can&#x27;t <i>create</i> them at more than a few kilohertz per core, and you can&#x27;t practically make them smaller than a few tens of kilobytes, all of which limit the power of the process as an abstraction facility.  (Linux has actually reduced the cost of processes, both in physical memory and in context-switch time, by more than an order of magnitude; I imagine OpenBSD has too.  But improving the situation much further probably requires different abstractions.)",1440861221

Ie the phrase &quot;“add up to sexual nirvana for <i>most</i> heterosexual men&quot; would pose no problem for you.<p>This is a different type of issue - I don&#x27;t mind people obsessed with semantics (identity politicers are a different matter). What you are basically saying is that &#x27;Even if there is 1% of men who are less interested in sex than women - that sentence if false&#x27;. While being technically true it misses the fact that any statement concerning large sets of anything can have excptions. The question is whether these exceptions are singular or sufficiently numerous to render the generalization false.<p>I think that anything over 90% doesn&#x27;t require qualifiers. Others may feel differently - for example note that the author already went out of his way to accommodate gays by talking about &#x27;heterosexual men&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;men&#x27;. So he is effectively tipping his hat to you in order to satisfy the 4% of the population who might react to the sentence with &#x27;I don&#x27;t care for sex with women at all, what a stupid generalization that is!&#x27;.<p>Overall - I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve made a case why the author is wrong to generalize that men are more interested in casual sex than women.",1440860637

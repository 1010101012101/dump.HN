(i.e. there was one bolt, no separate lock to doorknob)<p>it took a lot of effort, my intent was to hit the far side of the spinny thing and hope that the momentum would be enough to get through the catch and click it - i did this by extending my arm through the letterbox as far as possible then angling the spanner back and twisting my wrist to provide the impacts - feeling through the spanner if i was hitting anything and trying to guess from the response if it was the right thing. i found the right thing quickly by feeling around it and working out that it wobbled and made little clicks in the right ways.<p>the biggest problem was that the spanner was quite fantastically heavy when wielded this way - although the impact that knocked it open was not especially hard or directed I was quite tired by that point and it was a pleasant surprise when it popped open so i can&#x27;t honestly say it was the technique that worked more than the determination. my arm was struggling to continue raising the spanner and i was probably 20 minutes at most away from complete exhaustion and giving up... my arm was quite fantastically stiff and painful the next day - both the elbow and the wrist, and lingered a couple more days after that as a mild irritation.<p>I had no expectation that it would actually work it was just desperation... but it was 2am and nobody inside would answer their phone...

I&#x27;m convinced their actual algorithm hasn&#x27;t changed much in the last few years, despite announcements claiming otherwise.<p>They changed the handling of search queries (searches are interpreted much less literally than a few years ago). They changed the way that pages are indexed, and changed the intervals to be smarter (faster for news sites, slower for sites that don&#x27;t change). They now even &quot;render&quot; the pages partially to account for CSS and JS. They have smart stemming and synonym algorithms when building the indexes. But the actual algorithm - &quot;PageRank&quot; and the parts surrounding it - hasn&#x27;t changed much I think, except for some parameter tuning.<p>Instead, they probably have a pile of semi-automatic &quot;filters&quot; to deal with spam and blackhat SEO. Engineers write a filter in code, test it against a test index, and then it goes into the new index version. I believe they are going more and more into manual intervention, and that they can now directly penalize/push sites without going down to the indexing level.<p>I can&#x27;t prove it right now, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that the first SERP for popular search terms is actually manually curated, with the really organic links coming later.

The Raspberry Pi has a limited GPIO breakout (useful for many applications, but not tailored for robotics). And, besides not being designed to drive peripherals, the RPi&#x27;s power system has some issues[1] that even make hosting USB devices a pain.<p>It does seem like they could target the Beagle Bone Black and focus on the software, but they probably wanted more control over the power and peripheral connect strategy than the BBB provides.<p>The processor they chose includes an integrated DSP, which could be useful for sensor data processing--or even motor control. The original BeagleBoard offered an OMAP with a DSP, but TI is discontinuing the OMAP line[2] and the newer BBB uses a Sitara A8 processor without the DSP. I didn&#x27;t see the Rex&#x27;s processor choice listed on the kickstarter page, but I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s something like TI&#x27;s DM3730[3].<p>In summary, they seem to want to design a board specifically for robotics rather than building upon an existing general-purpose platform. This will give them more control over the power and peripheral strategy that will allow them to achieve a higher level of integration. This could also simplify software by limiting the number of busses and &quot;tacked on&quot; peripherals.<p>The founders come from Carnegie Mellon University, which has a first class robotics program. Also check out the CMUcam[4] project--an open source, computer vision module. The Pixy (CMUcam5) was funded[5] in September and looks really cool.<p>Edit: Check out the Rex page on the Alphalem site[6] too. It says that the &quot;Rex can supply up to 20A directly from a 6-12V Ni-MH battery to connected devices.

If by some fluke a government someday used a technique to pursue a person suspected of a crime, did so legally, and with moral justification (not a victimless crime), then it is legitimate on that occasion - but how would you propose to assure us that the same tehcnique can never be used by anyone else or in any other situation?  There is no basis for any such assumption; the same knowledge, skills, devices and so on will also be used by illegal, immoral and other actors at any opportunity (notably including NSA and LEAs).

You could almost include Asimov in that. Similarly, Arthur C. Clarke was oblivious to miniaturization while living in the thick of it.<p>I think one of the factors is romance -- SF writers want certain things to happen and just wish it into being, regardless of how plausible it really is (faster than light travel, time travel, anti-gravity, artificial gravity, laser pistols).<p>On the reverse side they tend to ignore technologies that are either unromantic or make stories more complicated or seem to fight against cliched dramatic opportunities.

7001733,comment,7000953,7000953,5,0,moron4hire,,,"I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time thinking about TODO lists and trying different solutions. Eventually, I settled on a very specific means of using good, old, pen-and-paper.<p>I think probably the most important feature of the TODO list is that it gives you mental clarity. Both the popular book &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; and a career couch I worked with for several months talk about the importance of clearing the mind before being able to begin work in earnest. If you have &quot;do the laundry&quot; stuck in your head, it&#x27;s going to be a major hurdle for getting through work. So, having some sort of system to capture everything that needs to be done is essential for staying on task with work.<p>So that means that the most important feature of TODO is capture. Any system that imposes overhead on capturing items for your TODO list will eventually fall out of habit. You&#x27;ll start to mentally prioritize which things go on the list and which things do not. That ultimately defeats the purpose of the TODO list, to get things out of mind, squirreled away in a safe place.<p>Thus, very formal issue trackers like BugZilla or Redmine (or anything else that has a separate &quot;issue entry page&quot;) are far too cumbersome for capture.<p>But being streamlined on capture is not the whole solution. Having used sites like PivotalTracker or Trello, I&#x27;ve fallen into traps of recording TOO much. Certain pie-in-the-sky tasks will sit in the list for months on end, getting no closer to ever getting worked on. It then becomes its own mental burden, worrying about whether or not certain TODO items will end up in that moribund pile. I even tried writing my own that had an arbitrary limit to the number of items I could enter. It just didn&#x27;t feel right. It was always too easy to just bump up the limit and keep adding items.<p>So with all of my experience with various activity and issue tracking systems, I went straight back to pen and paper. My system is very simple, but it is not from lack of design. Its simplicity is the design.<p>I use an ink pen on a yellow legal pad. The pads are cheap and readily available. The ink requires strike-throughs for error corrections. I write in two columns, but only to be able to use all of the paper. There is no semantic difference between the two columns.<p>I do not number things, unless I&#x27;m in crunch mode and am working very fast through a series of items. I am more likely to underline the high priority items, rather than number them. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really possible to prioritize things any more than &quot;things I&#x27;m working on in the next few hours&quot; versus &quot;things I&#x27;m not working on soon.&quot; Anything more than that really calls into question the entire concept of priority for me. It&#x27;s easy enough to scan the list and figure out priority as I work. I can also rewrite the list with higher priority items at the top if necessary. Usually it&#x27;s not necessary.<p>Completed items get scratched out, fairly heavily. The goal is then to fill the page with ink. It becomes a motivating factor to finish the last few items on the list.<p>The list is limited to 2 columns only and is not allowed to spill on to a second page. I rewrite the list either once a week or (more often) when the page is full to remove the completed items. I did three columns for a while, but it started to develop a deadpool at the bottom right end of the page, so I went back to two columns. Multiple pages would be even worse, and would make it harder to scan the total list. That basically means I&#x27;m limited to a max of 50 or so active items on my TODO list. I&#x27;ve found that, if I need much more than 50, then I&#x27;ve failed to manage my work correctly. The desire to record more is a signal that I&#x27;m procrastinating things and taking on too many commitments.<p>And that&#x27;s it. Any other feature of TODO list tracking is either too restricting on capture or too enabling on over capture. Pen and paper is it for me.",1388691727

As you point out, one expects that there is a small but finite probability to have Boltzmann brain-like things pop up in the universe.  And if it did happen it would violate the second law, which is making a statistical statement.<p>So my problem with the article (perhaps your comment should help to clarify) is that it attempts to start a discussion, involving some kind of anthropic principle/natural selection to resolve a paradox that doesn&#x27;t exist in the first place. The body of the article states:<p>>The usual resolution of the Boltzmann brain paradox is that we and our environment are the products of a long process of natural selection, which can produce complex and improbable outcomes without violating the laws of thermodynamics.<p>>The Boltzmann brain paradox is that any observers (self-aware brains with memories like we have, which includes our brains) are therefore far more likely to be Boltzmann brains than evolved brains, thereby at the same time also refuting the selection-bias argument. If our current level of organization, having many self-aware entities, is a result of a random fluctuation, it is much less likely than a level of organization which only creates stand-alone self-aware entities.<p>The authors of this article somehow turn a correct argument of the expectation value of the number of Boltzmann brains in an ensemble of universes to a claim that most brains in these universes must be Boltzmann brains. They do this without mentioning at all how to calculate the probability of non-Boltzmann brains (assuming the distinction is even valid). TO deal with the feeling of existential anxiety that they are left with at the worry they might be Boltzmann brains they then invoke a natural selection+ anthropic principle argument.<p>As far as I can tell has very little to do with the concept as it was introduced by the cosmologists.",1388691643

Other QA engineers exist in the company for in depth QA.<p>My initial question starts with: &quot;build a function that takes a string and produces an integer&quot;. About 30% of candidates fail to get anywhere. 50% produce an incorrect implementation. 20% produce an implementation that is mostly correct. 9% produce an implementation that is mostly correct and well tested. 1% actually produce a complete and correct response. Which, as of right now, translates to exactly 1 candidate in 2 years. Who was rejected due to culture fit. A complete and correct answer is not required to pass the screen. ;-)<p>The reason this question is so effective is due to how the question is asked and the details of the solution. There is a lot more than just the initial problem statement. The full script assess: the candidates ability to determine requirements; ability to produce complete set of unit tests; ability to handle the boundary conditions.<p>There is a sharp division that occurs between QA engineers and non-QA engineers on the requirements gathering. All but 1 non-QA engineer I&#x27;ve interviewed assumed they had all the requirements before writing code. A clever solution is almost useless if it solves the wrong problem. Sometimes even worse than useless if the code adds a maintenance cost for no value.<p>Covering all the critical cases in testing is the next part that most candidates fail at. Even if the requirements they assumed are correct, none of the non-QA engineers have succeeded in writing a complete and good set of tests. Many add too many tests.<p>After those two the other parts are just seeing how close they can get to building the correct implementation.

We don&#x27;t need big data to tell us that the top four favorite subjects of Netflix users are marriage, royalty, parenthood, and reunited lovers. We&#x27;ve been telling stories about those things for hundreds - if not thousands - of years.<p>The data can also be misleading, because sometimes what audiences want isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s good for dramatic effect. Both Dexter and Homeland suffered from audiences reacting positively to the main character, which caused Showtime to stop the writers from making creative decisions that yes, would have alienated the audience initially, but on the other hand would have made for shows that would have in their later seasons been better received.<p>Another example: I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you looked at the Netflix data it would show that people liked to watch movies and TV shows that either had happy endings or twist endings. The former makes you feel good, the latter makes you appreciate the writing. What people really <i>don&#x27;t</i> like are ambiguous endings. If we based creative decisions purely on audience data a show like The Sopranos wouldn&#x27;t have the ending it does.

Free market economics doesn&#x27;t have anything to say about how to handle this -- so we&#x27;re all in the dark.<p>It seems to me that as the marginal value of material goods diminishes relative to say the marginal value of not being beaten and robbed we should see a natural progression towards some kind of redistribution of wealth -- driven as much by enlightened self-interest as anything.

Scientists are human beings, too, with all the fallibility and lack of prescience that is our common heritage, and the fact that &quot;others may very well have eventually given them the same&quot; is the very crux of the matter at hand.<p>From our perspective, with the benefit of hindsight, it is trivially obvious that the Third Reich made no significant process toward the attainment of nuclear weapons, and that such weapons were not necessary to guarantee the Allies a victory in Europe. Do you think that was trivially obvious in 1942? It was nothing of the sort, and for all those who worked on the Manhattan Project could know, their efforts were absolutely vital to their nation&#x27;s successful prosecution of the war. In such circumstances, what you would no doubt consider a principled refusal to participate in the project would, in fact, constitute moral cowardice of the highest order, on the part of anyone who found Allied victory in any sense preferable to Axis. They could not have known, after all, that the Third Reich had no realistic hope of developing an atom bomb, given the time and resources available to them, and judging them on the basis of what we know now, seventy years after the Third Reich&#x27;s abject defeat and dissolution, is purely foolish.<p>All of this goes to demonstrate your basic error, which is to consider &quot;scientists&quot; a single, unified category which can, or can be expected to, act as a whole in whatever it believes, again as a whole, to be the best interests of mankind. This produces a sort of &quot;us and them&quot; mentality, which implicitly elevates your &quot;scientists&quot; category to the level of the superhuman actors whose existence my &quot;angels or aliens&quot; formulation makes explicit. It is this mentality which permits you to expect knowledge and behavior of scientists which you do not expect of <i>humans</i>, and it is precisely this mistake the original author makes.",1388690932

It all comes down to price and some companies price certain generics at below cost (i.e. loss leaders) in order to gain other business.<p>The most interesting quote I&#x27;ve read was from Barry Sherman who runs Apotex, one of the biggest generic drug makers.

Bend the ends outward for better control over depth and angle.<p>Insert the binder clip wire, apply some torque, and scrub the pointy end of the triangle on your former paper clip against the pins.

We&#x27;re still not all that far along in learning how to treat mental illnesses, and using medicine to make people more moral would probably be similarly difficult. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s not a solution, just that we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if building a solution of that sort turns out to have a difficulty more like curing PTSD than preventing childbed fever.<p>I also think that making humans act more morally probably has more to do with helping us recognize and think clearly about moral decisions, than making us care more. One of the reasons the Gates foundation is special is that they&#x27;re trying to help people <i>efficiently</i>. The way human minds are built makes it hard to realize that it&#x27;s important to be efficient at doing good, rather than just to make an effort.<p>I guess this is coming from someone whose empathy dial is turned up to eleven anyway, though, so it could also be that different people have different problems to overcome to be more moral. The problems I had were not forgetting about causes of suffering just because they don&#x27;t happen to be staring me in the face at the moment, and then focusing on the right things.<p>The website LessWrong has some interesting writing about why humans suck at charity <a href""http://lesswrong.com/lw/aid/heuristics_and_biases_in_charity"" rel""nofollo"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/aid/heuristics_and_biases_in_charity...</a> , and learning how to reason better in general is the main thing they write about. The main effects the stuff I read there has had on my morality-related actions are that I take my career more seriously (I don&#x27;t actually care that much about more money for me, but I do care about more resources for improving the world), and I worry less about small stuff (I accept inefficiencies in my own life if fixing them doesn&#x27;t look worth the effort, and don&#x27;t get distracted by projects that would help people but only a small amount).<p>Some of what you&#x27;re talking about here - the idea of giving flamethrowers to children - sounds similar to the idea of existential risk, though on a smaller scale.

With regard to giving praise, I think NVC is quite insightful.",1388689242

My favourite apocryphal story illustrates this point:<p>---<p>One day a group of scientists got together and decided that man had come a long way and no longer needed God. So they picked one scientist to go and tell Him that they were done with Him.<p>The scientist walked up to God and said, &quot;God, we&#x27;ve decided that we no longer need you. We&#x27;re to the point that we can clone people and do many miraculous things, so why don&#x27;t you just go on and get lost.&quot;<p>God listened very patiently and kindly to the man and after the scientist was done talking, God said, &quot;Very well, how about this, let&#x27;s say we have a man making contest.&quot; To which the scientist replied, &quot;OK, great!&quot;<p>But God added, &quot;Now, we&#x27;re going to do this just like I did back in the old days with Adam.&quot;<p>The scientist said, &quot;Sure, no problem&quot; and bent down and grabbed himself a handful of dirt.<p>God just looked at him and said, &quot;No, no, no. You go get your own dirt!&quot;",1388689221

I thing I would attribute the social stuff to a lesson I got from a KPCB guy at F8: Major startup innovation happens every 14 or so years because it takes that long for a new generation to grow up with the existing technology (today that&#x27;s social) as second nature. Then (frequently) some tw/teen kid (Jobs/Gates, Zuckerberg) stepping on that invents the next big thing while tinkering. You can see that process evolving tech from hardware, to PC, to browser, to web, to social, to mobile.",1388689218

And this is both a damning statement of humanity as well as a heretical statement against religion and history.<p>Morality was always inside the human. No evolution needed here. But from an evolutionary perspective, the evolution of morality was the defining factor that made us drastically different other species.<p>Then what causes some people to be Buddha, Jesus, Moses, or Muhammadﷺ while others to be ignorant and vicious? Morality needs to be brought to health and vigor after being subdued because of social or political conflict. This is often termed enlightenment.<p>And religion has always been a powerful vehicle and force to establish morality in individuals, a vehicle that carries arguably the divine rule, or an evolutionary mechanism that is carried through trial and failure.",1388689205

I imagine most people will only dedicate the time and mental energy to basic micro- and macro-economics. People in general, the brain, is very bad in general at understanding and seeing the exponential effects of systems. It&#x27;s nice to see contributions like yours that help balance out and show another part of reality. :)",1388689204

Also, you don&#x27;t get notifications when somebody pushes a new commit to their work branch or rebases, so there&#x27;s a lot of manual watching of these PRs during the review cycle that sometimes gets dropped (though our myriad GH bots could probably fix this!).<p>Even with the challenges, we love having this kind of bug as a way to bring in more contributors and keep development on the project accessible, and like the author, I&#x27;d highly recommend it to other projects.",1448458897

I mean, think about it: sneaky fees and outrageous surcharges are anathema, because it&#x27;s more important for members to be satisfied with their experience than to wring out every nickel and dime of profit at the expense of customer satisfaction. And credit unions have been around a long time, so we know the model works.<p>What&#x27;s stopping credit unions from being competitive against traditional banks are the regulatory hurdles. For instance, all credit unions&#x27; members must have some common affiliation, such as a small geographic area, or a common employer or alma mater.  So you can&#x27;t just create a credit union that competes with the likes of Capital One 360 or other online banks, even though it would be beneficial for that to happen, because the law says it can&#x27;t be open to just anyone.<p>Although credit unions are perhaps the most successful and widespread example of cooperative businesses in the U.S., we Americans have not really embraced cooperatives, and that&#x27;s a shame. Look at the U.K., where one of the most popular grocery chains is a co-op, or at Mondragon in Spain. Wouldn&#x27;t it be awesome to have something like Walmart, but entirely member-owned?  Instead of all those profits going to a relatively few wealthy shareholders, they&#x27;d go back to the members in the form of lower prices.<p>Technology has made it easier to gather like-minded people to start cooperatives.

But it is actually quite obtuse to let law govern issues of human use in shorter time frames. Needs arise faster than concrete sets.<p>Um, we do leave it up to them to comply with local codes. I&#x27;m not sure what the objection is. They don&#x27;t get an option to comply with codes or not. You aren&#x27;t building anything in a major downtown area without a permit, which means complying with all local codes.<p>If a community wanted to mandate that x% of a building&#x27;s lower level had to be dedicated to street level retail, they could easily do that. Builders would either decide if it were worthwhile or not. For the most part, developers/owners do not need much encouragement to increase rentable square footage in a building.",1448456807

7168138,comment,7167719,7168105,6,0,_delirium,,,"You don&#x27;t seem to have succeeded in debunking anything relevant to this post. This post is simply pointing out that, in part because the Super Bowl is organized by a nonprofit that is exempt from taxes on its local economic activity (purchases, hotel usage, etc.), its benefit to the city/region hosting the Super Bowl is quite limited. For example, it may generate more hotel usage, but it may also displace some tax-paying hotel usage with non-tax-paying hotel usage, which cancels out some of that added activity.<p>But more generally, the Super Bowl, a for-profit activity mainly aiming to enrich the teams who are NFL members, has structured much of its activity such that the NFL itself, a nonprofit organization, is doing all the organization and purchasing, thereby exempting most of the local economic activity from sales taxes, hotel occupancy taxes, and similar. A proper arrangement would be that the for-profit corporations profiting from the Super Bowl should be organizing it, rather than laundering their signature product through a nonprofit organization.<p>I can&#x27;t think of another case where a group of companies&#x27; <i>main</i> product is run by an umbrella nonprofit. Chamber-of-commerce organizations usually do pretty minor coordinating and lobbying activity, not actual production operations. To get something analogous in tech you&#x27;d have to imagine something silly like all the cloud-computing companies getting together and setting up a Cloud Services Association, a 501(c)(6) nonprofit that operates all their datacenters jointly, rather than e.g. Amazon or Microsoft operating their own datacenters on a for-profit basis.",1391384858

They had many opportunities to be the Italian Apple (they even owned ARM from 1985 to 1998!), all of them missed because of terrible management choices.<p>The Programma 101 was a perfect combination of innovative technology, usability and industrial design. When it was introduced at the New York World&#x27;s Fair it stole the show. However, the management decided not to pursue any more r&d on the project.

If there was a case for it, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d happily do it and charge extra for it - just like many of them charge extra to guarantee delivery before a certain time in the morning.<p>1.1) Is missed deliveries really that big of a problem? Anecdotally, I order a lot of things online for delivery - to the extent that I managed to make over 190 orders on Amazon alone in one year. In the past two years or so, I&#x27;ve had less than a dozen parcels that couldn&#x27;t be delivered on the first or second try. I live in a building with six other apartments - it&#x27;s rare that someone isn&#x27;t around to sign for a package.<p>2) There&#x27;s an increasing number of shops that offer a locker service like Amazon Locker Service.

7168027,comment,7166104,7167601,2,0,mpyne,,,"> Even if you think Bitcoin will triple in price tomorrow, it still makes sense to spend Bitcoin today because you can easily replace it with Bitcoin purchased at the current price.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t make any sense, because you&#x27;d have to pay 3x as much to replace that Bitcoin. That&#x27;s the whole point.<p>That&#x27;s also why you should spend your dollars first. Even if Bitcoin value doesn&#x27;t change a bit the dollar becomes worth less every day, which means you can buy less and less and less Bitcoin with that dollar as time goes buy. Better to use the dollar while its value is still at a maximum.<p>With Bitcoin the value will likely keep going up, especially once the supply crunch happens. A Bitcoin you give up today will be harder to recover tomorrow, the day after that, etc.<p>Accordingly you are wasting money if you&#x27;re spending Bitcoin now which will be more valuable in a year while you have dollars you could be spending for the same thing that would otherwise be worth less in a year.<p>You might make the decision to use Bitcoin regardless, but that&#x27;s a decision based on your own policies and wants, not a decision based on maximizing the value of the currency you spend.",1391382839

But under the U.S. sales-tax system nonprofits have blanket exemption, while businesses generally don&#x27;t. Services such as hotels used in business travel, for example, are generally not exempt, so the NFL would pay occupancy tax if it were not a 501(c)(6) organization (or a state chose not to recognize that exemption). And whether purchase of goods is exempt depends on the state and the specific kind of good; most provide very specific lists of exempted &quot;machinery and equipment&quot; that fall far short of everything.

The airline isn&#x27;t buying the fuel the day you buy your ticket or the day you fly, they&#x27;re buying the fuel the day they schedule the flight via futures (or if they aren&#x27;t ,they should be).

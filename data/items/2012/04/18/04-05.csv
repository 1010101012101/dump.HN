3856526,comment,3850935,3850935,29,0,tptacek,,,"This deserves so much more attention here than it's going to get. It's also genuinely TL, and many here DR at all. For what it's worth, if he starts to lose you, here are some of the key points:<p>* You'd want to know that David Lowery was the lead singer for Camper Van Beethoven (of ""Take The Skinheads Bowling"" fame) and Cracker (of ""Low"" fame). You'd quickly learn from this that Lowery was trained as a mathematician and worked as a quant near the CME, and worked with Andy Mason at his pre-Groupon company. He's a punchcard and packet radio chat nerd.<p>* He's tired of people telling him that musicians need to ""embrace"" technology. They were embracing technology in the '90s. They paid to have people run complicated websites. He's tired of people telling him to sell more t-shirts. Bands have sold t-shirts since the '70s. It's shitty money. And people pirate t-shirts too!<p>* Concerts are also shitty money for most artists. People thought otherwise because we inadvertently cherry pick stats from artists that happen to do crazy well at concerts. Lowery runs a serious recording studio, his wife is a notable concert booker. Musicians aren't making money at concerts. Many are living out of their vans.<p>* Recording albums is deceptively expensive in ways that technology doesn't address. ProTools can get marginally cheaper but the mix engineer doesn't get any cheaper. Mix engineers are expensive skilled professionals. Recordings sound like crap when you don't do them professionally. The mix engineer doesn't get to sell t-shirts at concerts.<p>* He's going to lose a lot of you by sniping at the industry for ""defending software patents"", as if that was a double standard. Get past that to his real point: technologists work in an industry that is supported by protectable IP. Even if you work solely on NetBSD, you'd make a lot less money if no software was protectable. No music is protectable anymore. There is a serious double standard.<p>* He gets it: you can give to get. He's been giving away music for decades. His shows were all recorded and given away for free; his bands organized CD burning trees. But that was his choice and he did it on his terms. The new terms are dictated to artists: your stuff will be available for free online.<p>* The old system was better for artists. Not because the labels were better. It was probably an accident. Editorial aside: or maybe tech companies are just better at squeezing surplus value out of systems.<p>* People tend to remark about how low artist royalties were in the label system. That didn't tell the whole story! Artists received sizable advances calibrated for ""modest success"" level outcome for their recordings. The overwhelming majority of artists never recouped those advances. So the <i>effective</i> royalty rate was much higher; possibly, for most bands, over 50%.<p>* Not only that, but artists received a <i>mechanical</i> 70-95 cents every time their album sold, even when they hadn't recouped. So no matter what the economics of a given contract were, when you download a pirated album instead of buying it, the artist loses nearly a buck.<p>* Artists don't talk about how good they have it because it's not cool to talk about how good you have it.<p>* Music distribution in 2012 is lockers, streaming, and stores.<p>* Lockers are straight-up piracy. They make huge revenues (ed aside: ""MegaUpload Considers IPO"" revenues) from ""accelerated downloads"" and from ad placement. Musicians get zero of that money.<p>* Speaking of piracy: recorded music sales are off over 60% since the advent of piracy. There are studies that try to show that musicians are better off in the long run. But many of them are playing games. Some pour game revenue into the same bucket as music revenue. Others use sleight of hand to equate 99 cent single downloads with album sales. One suggested a successful indie musician had seen increased revenues recently, but it turned out that musician made only 34k/yr. People circulate wildly inaccurate stories and infographics about how labels screw artists and accept them without question.<p>* Streaming tries to pay artists but not by viable amounts. Moreover, streaming pricing isn't transparent. Some artists get better deals, paid on different scales, than other artists.<p>* Stores are reliably paying artists. But the economics don't totally add up.<p>* The 1980s value chain: artist < store < label. The artist got the least, yes. But stores took on inventory risk and were compensated for that. Labels financed recording and distribution and were compensated. All three links in the chain provided significant value.<p>* The 2012 value chain: artist < iTunes < label. The artist makes marginally more. But iTunes does't add significant value: unlike the stores, which were paid to take inventory risk and predict demand, iTunes takes no risk and performs almost no service other than dealing with card processing fees.<p>* BUT HE'S FINE WITH THAT. He's a market guy. More competition would fix this problem.<p>* Except: how do you compete with Apple, Google, and Facebook? For a little while musicians could make decent money selling music on their websites. 100% of the revenue less processing fees. Then Facebook and Youtube took all the traffic. Visitor stats plummeted. New content has to be released on Facebook or Youtube; that's where the audience is. But he has no control on Facebook or Youtube. He has to fit into their revenue model, or swim against a tsunami to try to find an audience for a standalone web site, hoping to be one of the few people with outcomes like Louis CK.<p>* Again, he says: the old system was better. You could make a living more reliably as a musician under the major label system than you can today. The label system at least cared about music --- not in the ""have great taste, prefer The Kinks to The Turtles"" kind of way, but in a ""our incentives align somewhat"" kind of way. But music is just a footnote to Facebook & Google. The new players don't care at all about the music industry, because they're in the tech industry, and the only thing that matters to the tech industry is turning software into money.<p>You don't have to agree with any of this (I happen to buy all of it, wholesale; maybe it's because the rest of my family are musicians). You also don't have to believe that the tech industry owes it to musicians to change anything so that people can make a living as musicians (that's not what I believe, but I believe a lot of things you don't). But you should probably <i>engage fully</i> with what Lowery is saying before you try to claim that startups and tech companies are making things better for musicians, because this is him calling bullshit on you directly.",1334724229

3856493,comment,3854529,3855719,1,0,fusiongyro,,,"> Fun challenge: try making a smalltalk app that isn't easily recognizable as a smalltalk app.<p>It is true that both Lisp and Smalltalk make it very easy for people to build things that would normally take a team and an architecture. This has the down side that if it's easy to build something that acts sort of like a button, that's what ships rather than bridging to some OS button. It's a lot of work to implement for no obvious benefit, especially to the Smalltalk programmer who is using the system because they like it and don't mind the differences. This seems like exactly the sort of thing that would make for-pay Smalltalk systems viable, but nobody seems to be willing to pay for a language now. Even if it would be cheaper in the long run, it's harder to do the math and it's hard to compete with free.<p>> I hope too there can be a ""Clojure for smalltalk"", if you will.<p>I think this is a concept that should be explored in more depth. Some things I'd toss out as worth discussing:<p>- Having a standard library or syntax for defining classes (GNU Smalltalk addresses this)<p>- Real namespacing, because I'm sick of seeing XXYYZZClassName<p>- Sexy, dirt-simple FFI to C or Java. Probably, as you point out, through a standard calling convention for external stuff (maybe borrow the Block API, something f value: a value: b value: c).<p>I think apart from these things you could really build the Smalltalk of tomorrow in the Smalltalk of today. You need really good OS integration, especially graphically but every other way as well. You probably need to be able to serialize the system to ordinary flat text files so you can use modern VC.<p>I know Juan Vuletich has been rebuilding the standard image his way from the ground up with Cuis but as far as I can tell progress is stalled. Other than that I don't know of any big project besides Pharo, which is even more modest, really just about removing crap from Squeak and producing a professional shame-free open source Smalltalk.",1334723429

3856487,comment,3851691,3856382,3,0,waterhouse,,,"Heh heh heh.  I'm flattered, but really, all it takes is for one kid to come up with one strategy that works; after that, others could find out about it through word of mouth or the internet.  I could imagine a kid noticing by accident that... not having access to the calculator, I can't be sure whether any specific example will work, other than the ones described on the website... but I can imagine a kid finding by accident that, while ""A * B * C"" fits a certain estimate, if you ask the calculator what A * B is (about 20) and put in ""20 * C"" and give the same estimate, it will reject it.  It's likely that either he will figure some things out (trying things like putting (A * B / 20) * C, and trying that with other values of C), or he will be confused and announce it to the class, in which case someone else will probably figure things out.  And this is to say nothing of a clever kid who knows math and who deliberately looks in the first place for ways to defeat the device (perhaps after the device offends him by rejecting an honest estimate).<p>I would warn in general against underestimating the cleverness of children, even those who appear not to understand the material of the class.  From John Holt's ""How Children Fail"" (letter from May 10, 1958), describing some elementary school classes:<p><i>Children are often quite frank about the strategies they use to get answers out of a teacher. I once observed a class in which the teacher was testing her students on parts of speech. On the blackboard she had three columns, headed Noun, Adjective, and Verb. As she gave each word, she called on a child and asked in which column the word belonged.<p>Like most teachers, she hadn't thought enough about what she was doing to realize, first, that many of the words given could fit into more than one column and, second, that it is often the way a word is used that determines what part of speech it is.<p>There was a good deal of the tried-and-true strategy of guess-and-look, in which you start to say a word, all the while scrutinizing the teacher's face to see whether you are on the right track or not. With most teachers, no further strategies are needed.<p>This one was more poker-faced than most, so guess-and-look wasn't working very well. Still, the percentage of hits was remarkably high, especially since it was clear to me from the way the children were talking and acting that they hadn't a notion of what nouns, adjectives, and verbs were. Finally one child said, ""Miss , you shouldn't point to the answer each time."" The teacher was surprised, and asked what she meant. The child said, ""Well, you don't exactly point, but you kind of stand next to the answer."" This was no clearer, since the teacher had been standing still. But after a while, as the class went on, I thought I saw what the girl meant. Since the teacher wrote each word down in its proper column, she was, in a way, getting herself ready to write, pointing herself at the place where she would soon be writing. From the angle of her body to the blackboard the children picked up a subtle clue to the correct answer.<p>This was not all. At the end of every third word, her three columns came out even, that is, there were an equal number of nouns, adjectives, and verbs. This meant that when she started off a new row, you had one chance in three of getting the right answer by a blind guess; but for the next word, you had one chance in two, and the last word was a dead giveaway to the lucky student who was asked it. Hardly any missed this opportunity, in fact, they answered so quickly that the teacher (brighter than most) caught on to their system and began keeping her columns uneven, making the strategist's job a bit harder.</i><p>He adds later:<p><i>Not long after the book came out I found myself being driven to a meeting by a professor of electrical engineering in the graduate school of MIT. He said that after reading the book he realized that his graduate students were using on him, and had used for the ten years and more he had been teaching there, all the evasive strategies I described in the bookmumble, guess-and-look, take a wild guess and see what happens, get the teacher to answer his own questions, etc.<p>But as I later realized, these are the games that all humans play when others are sitting in judgment on them.</i>",1334723322

I sit (uncomfortably) on the fence in these things; I think the current law on copyright is a disaster on wheels, but having spent years as a Starving Artist the problem of revenue for content creators is not an abstract one to me, and I can't bring myself to download copyrighted movies and music the way other people do. I used to buy a lot of media, now I compromise by renting it or opting for what's available on YouTube (where rightsholders have a reliable mechanism for asserting ownership of their IP if they feel an upload infringes upon them).<p>The bit that really pained me was his mention of John Perrry Barlow doing his schtick at the SF Music Summit. I was getting into the internet when the WELL was still in full swing and vividly recall Barlow's Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace - what young digital idealist <i>wouldn't</i> thrill to such vaulting sentiments? Two decades later, the notions of elective citizenship and intentional nationality continue to fascinate, but not the notions that the ends justify the means and that the economics will take care of themselves.<p>I am very happy that the technological means of production have become so much cheaper; I have several synthesizers and related audio gear sitting on this desk I'm at now, and a great camera that allows me to shoot excellent video in HD - one handed. When I first learned my way around a movie set the cameras weighed 30 pounds and I had to use a tape recorder the size of a concrete block. Unfortunately, my technical mastery (or at least commercially viable skill) came at the same time that the market for the end product fragmented drastically - as the technology became cheaper, so the skills of people who were skilled in its use became massively devalued. We had another example the other day involving a photographer talking to a calendar publisher whose photo rights budget amounted to a mere $100. Now, I'm not really an entrepreneur, and I don't dispute that there are abundant commercial opportunities that I could have exploited and haven't; I'm hopeful that the increasing popularity of crowdfunding and the possible democratization of investment from the JOBS bill will facilitate capital-raising for small projects.<p>But the downside that Lowery so elegantly articulates here is that to succeed in the new commercial marketplace, a creative type needs to also be his or her own manager/marketer/salesperson/etc., to a far greater degree than before - and that means less time spent developing one's craft and creations. The old models of funding and distribution in the arts weren't totally fair, but they <i>were</i> predictable and relatively stable. If you were lucky and/or talented enough to get and exploit a few breaks, then there was a professional infrastructure within which you can find your own niche, whether as an artist or a technician. As the market for the end product has fragmented and revenue models have become obsolete, producers and publishers have become more risk-averse and increasingly channeled their funds to the surest prospects (which are often the lowest common denominator in creative terms). This naturally means fewer insiders willing to take the risk of financing and publishing an unknown prospect. And why should they, when people will bend over backwards and pay to have their films considered for inclusion in a film festival (most indies have neither the know-how nor the cash to sell their project at a film buyer's market, and film schools are in no hurry to teach them)?<p>It's not all bad, by any means. But it's not all good either; the old system provided extremely valuable mentoring and marketing utility to emerging creatives, and trial and error isn't a very efficient alternative.<p>Also interesting is this MetaFilter thread about the same post, though the first half is kind of Night of the Living Strawmen: <a href=""http://www.metafilter.com/114955/Fool-me-once-shame-on-you-fool-me-twice-wont-get-fooled-again"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metafilter.com/114955/Fool-me-once-shame-on-you-f...</a>",1334722934

Pinterest can be seen as an extension of this but with more features (ability to group things rather than just having a single stream).

There's always been ways that they are front-runed by more nimble traders.<p>Currently, the state-of-art for institutional investors are to use buy-side algorithmic tools to slice and dice their orders into 100 lots and obfuscate their huge lot order (> 100,000 shares). Algo's include iceberg which continuously monitors the quotebook throughout the day and execute a portion of customer's orders when the market turns in favor of direction of the order and with an order size not to disrupt the current momentum of the stock's price action; also special darkpools are used at mutual funds such as Liquidnet where no official quotebook are maintained, instead it's more of an instant messenger tool that is limited to only mutual fund managers who chit-chat and close large block deals. Any participants who are suspected of front-running are banned.<p>As for your original concern, yes spread of a few cents per share is very important for institutional investors when you have to execute a order for 100,000+ shares; and there's actually a whole technology vendor space in finance called transaction cost analysis that fund managers look at to see what the hidden cost of their trades are. As whether HFT actually help institutional investors, it's analogous to saying whether defense contractors help the federal government; some say it's symbiotic relationship, some say it's a parasitic relationship for all and symbiotic for some. Meaning most relationships on Wall Street like on Capital Hill, revolves around wine & dine & shifting allegiances. Quite a few HFT firms have tried to open a new line of revenue by opening up their high-speed infrastructure to institutions to execute their iceberg orders. Yet some of the HFT algorithms' intentions are to sniff out iceberg orders and front-run them.",1334722516

And then use the profits from that product to advertise and attract enough visitors that lead to at least 1 more sale - and create a perpetual traffic cycle out of it.  (I'm writing a 60 page book on it.)<p>Some things I've learned from experience.<p>1. You don't want to use the Google Keyword Tool. Thats a good tool for keyword suggestions. Not for keyword bidding.  You want to use Google's Traffic Estimator tool instead.  You will have to login to your Google Adwords account to use it. (Adwords > Tools & Analysis > Traffic Estimator)<p>2. You don't want to use category defining keywords. You want to make it slightly long tail. Don't search for ""crossfit"". Search for ""crossfit training"". Don't search for ""speed reading"". Search for ""learn speed reading"". Why? Because Google starts minimum bids for category defining keywords from $1 - even if there aren't any competing advertisers on that keyword. This inflates the numbers in your formula.<p>3. After searching for a keyword in the Traffic Estimator tool, click on ""Impressions"" and hover your mouse over the cliff in the graph they show. That is the Max CPC you want to take while calculating your price. (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/upj77.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/upj77.png</a>)<p>With the above steps, the CPC you get for learn speed reading is 41 cents. If you expect a 1% conversion rate, you need a product that sells for about $41 minimum.<p>If you go to the clickbank.com marketplace and search for speed reading, you will see that the most popular product on speed reading (Quickeye Speed Reading Software) is infact priced at $47.",1334722444

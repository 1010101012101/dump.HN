11006743,comment,11006067,11006067,0,0,elliott34,,,"I think the best part of this article is the approach to learning new things he presents--going beneath the surface, learning the fundamentals below the “API” layer (abstractly speaking). Really great explanation of that insight!<p>The part I am having trouble with, with ~5 years of real world data science experience in industry, is the <i>implicit assumption that we all need or want to become good at deep learning.</i><p>In my experience, most businesses, at best, are still struggling with <i>overfitting logistic regression in Excel</i> let alone implementing/integrating it with a production code base. And we all know that toy ML models that sit on laptops create ZERO value beyond fodder for Board presentations or moving the CMO&#x27;s agenda forward.<p>The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of businesses, with respect to statistics/ML, aren’t doing super duper basic shit (like a random forest microservice that scores some sort of transaction) that might increase some metric 10%. This is due to lack of sophisticated analytics infrastructure/bureaucracy/ lack of talent/ being too scared of statistics. Ultimately when you’re rolling out a machine learning product internally (I’m not talking about Azure/ other aws-model-training-as-a-service type things), the hardest part isn’t: “We need to increase our accuracy by 2% by using Restricted Convolutionallly Recurrent Bayesian Machines!” The hardest part is <i>convincing people you need to integrate a new process into a “production” workflow, and then maintaining that process.</i>",1454255862

Crawler/Indexer and Webserver/queries. Crawler is a root-server with 1gbit/s connection hosted in a datacenter. Webserver sits here at home with 200mbit downstream and 20mbit upstream.<p>I use the Alexa top-1-million sites as seed-list for the crawler. The errors that do appear during the crawl are either sites that have an outage or more likely simply dead-links. Oh, and URLs that turn out to be blocked by robots.txt. There are a lot of sites out there which block anything but Google and Bing from crawling them.<p>Cloudflare is not an option for me. It would let Cloudflare know what my users are searching for.

They had stable, good-paying jobs with proper pensions, and could easily afford to buy a home big enough for a family. It cost about twice their annual income.<p>They &quot;won the lottery&quot; with me in that I had an innate interest in technology and got into computers and networks in the mid 1980s. I ended up at a public land-grant college, but even if I hadn&#x27;t, I happened to have the right skills at the right time to ride the .com boom and acquire experience despite my lack of pedigree (and 20 years on, it no longer matters what school I went to.) I busted ass and continue to do so, but I&#x27;m not blind to my fortune. And yet, I do not and have never had a pension, and I have always spent 2-4x the fraction of my income on housing than my parents did, for worse housing. Most of my generation was not so lucky as me, but at least they were about to get jobs and build a resume.<p>My kids are young and if they&#x27;re just as smart and hard-working as me, they&#x27;re fucked. The ladder has been pulled up, and pedigree is a lot more important starting out now than it was when I was younger. (I know, I&#x27;ve been a hiring manager for years - and in technology which is a MUCH more egalitarian field than most due to demand.) To give my kids an advantage I&#x27;ve moved to a small country in Western Europe so they can grow up multilingual and have cultural exposure that might make them attractive to elite schools in the event that we&#x27;ve &quot;won the lottery&quot; with their natural abilities. And if they don&#x27;t, if nothing else, they have access to less expensive housing, education and health care, and live in a society that&#x27;s much more egalitarian than the US - one that might give them a shot at &quot;just a living&quot; without exposure to the worst predatory aspects of American poverty.<p>All this is to say, no, things aren&#x27;t the same. Yes, one still has to work very hard to be the best (one also must  be very lucky to be the very best.) The difference is, there was once &quot;good enough to make a decent living&quot; and now, not so much.

They learn from your actions what is correct and incorrect behavior without you having to directly teach it. Good behaviour is comprised of the union of two sets: behaviour that you allow, and behaviour that you partake in. If these sets overlap then you can be pretty sure that your child will learn &#x27;good behaviour&#x27; as defined by you.<p>I would also add that many beneficial social movements favouring equality among humans have been contested by adults who were brought up to share their parents&#x27; values. I hesitate to say that most children do not care about colour or sexuality until they are taught by their parents that differences are bad, or see their parents reactions to people who are &#x27;different&#x27;.",1454252956

That is to say, it didn’t do anything particularly different, or did what alternative products did differently. It integrates well with the Apple ecosystem, and that digital crown is interesting( from what I am hearing, it’s not that great in practice ), and..well, that’s about it, really.<p>I believe Apple can eventually transform this into a great product, one step at a time. I am not personally drawn to the Watch, or any ‘smart watch’ for that matter, but maybe it’s because I haven’t experienced yet what Apple hasn’t invented yet that would make me want to buy and wear it. \nMaybe next year when the Home Kit initiative enables ‘smart devices’ and the watch to play nice together, or when you can control your Apple Car using the watch and Siri (if you can name your Apple car, I ‘ll name mine KITT), then I ‘ll really want it.",1454252633
11006592,comment,11005999,11006512,0,0,notalaser,,,"That argument is made in the context of IRC networks, where the same server can have clients over both encrypted and unencrypted connections. If your own connection is encrypted, an eavesdropper listening at your router&#x27;s exit can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re typing. However, clients over unencrypted connections will get your message -- unencrypted! -- so an eavesdropper can just as well listen there, and he&#x27;ll get your messages. He won&#x27;t get your password, but <i>will</i> get your data.<p>The argument holds for every similar system. E.g. TLS connections to a SMTP server mean that an eavesdropper won&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re asking the SMTP server to send, but if that server then relays your message over an unencrypted connection, all that TLS mumbo-jumbo won&#x27;t help a bit, because the server just published your data in plain sight. Your password is safe, sure, but your data is in plain view, so if someone wants to spy on you, they don&#x27;t even need your password anymore.<p>So if you&#x27;re sending plaintext data over an encrypted connection, you <i>are</i> trusting that the server won&#x27;t reveal that data by relaying it over other unencrypted connections.",1454252576

It's highly likely that they were easy to sway by a concerted effort by MS. <p>This was a very clever PR move to create confusion in the marketplace.

I got only one question where is the unification? If everyone has an API and every service is building on top of others, aren't we going to end up with a big pile of junk? Someone oughta find a way to make all this APIs talk seamlessly to each other or as I suggested ""Build an API for user data"" and let other service plug into us.",1193797992

If you think you are free,  Just quit your job for few weeks (over 60 days), and see what happens.
Illegal.  Stay without a job over 6 months, and you can't get in the US for 10 years.  Try to work another job, (that is not related to your profession),  and it is considered illegal employment.  It can be Automatic deportation.
Even if you want to part-time DJ  (for fun), can be considered automatic deportation.<p>Also, a lot of very early stage startups don't want to deal (or don't have time and money) with such immigration hassles.  <p>Sorry, this is not complete freedom.   I am treated relatively well by my company, and make good money,  but I'd also like to have the option to just quit, and work something out of my own, and see where it goes. I can't right now, and neither can you,  unless you want to go back to your country, and say this country good bye for good.",1193796175

6982210,comment,6981843,6981974,5,0,vacri,,,"Why would a free market guarantee net neutrality? All the big players could still prefer to offer products that curtail it. There&#x27;s no logical step ensuring net neutrality.<p>An example - in Australia, there is an ISP called Internode, which used to be run by a techie called Hackett. They were very much for user&#x27;s rights and net neutrality, and were always at the forefront of lobbying the government for users. Their support centers are in-country, and the web tools they offer make techies happy.<p>But they only have a sliver of the ISP pie, despite the very high quality product - because that shit does not come cheap. They&#x27;re 50-100% more expensive. Instead the public run towards big brands like Optus - who actively engage in tactics like obscuring the structure of your bill to make it harder to understand, or engage in openly deceptive marketing, and see users as cattle to manipulate. Or they&#x27;ll go to bargain-basement ISPs with woeful service, then complain about that service and give you a hateful stare when you suggest they pay a little more for good service.<p>I can see zero evidence to suggest that &#x27;net neutrality&#x27; is a killer feature that would be automatically enabled by a free market.",1388361540

6982066,comment,6979684,6980946,2,0,bad_user,,,"The problem with M:N is that the kernel has better info on doing efficient scheduling. To make M:N work with preemptive scheduling, the process&#x27; runtime would have to communicate with the kernel and agree with it on the best scheduling strategy. And currently, this is a recipe for disaster.<p>This is why M:N scheduling is in practice <i>cooperative</i> and Rust currently does this too. How it works - basically,  when pseudo-blocking I/O calls are made, the active task has to <i>yield</i> (by itself) the execution to another task waiting in line, while it &quot;blocks&quot; for the result. It&#x27;s very similar to what happens in Scala when dealing with Futures/scala-async, or what happens in C# with &quot;async&quot;, or what happens in Clojure with core.async.<p>Above I&#x27;ve said &quot;pseudo-blocking&quot; for a reason, because it depends on language features to execute non-blocking I/O operations as if they are blocking. The problem with this is that truly blocking operations will block the OS thread for real.<p>Also, this architecture is only a win if you&#x27;re in a context in which your tasks are mostly CPU-bound, or if you don&#x27;t have enough threads to block (e.g. like in the context of servers responding to web requests, in which the upper limit is unbounded). Blocking I/O yields better throughput than asynchronous I/O. In terms of throughput the JVM&#x27;s blocking I/O primitives are beating any M:N architecture, like Golang, because yes, epoll comes at a cost. Heck, even asynchronous I/O on top of the JVM has better throughput, again because of 1:1 multi-threading.<p>> <i>it&#x27;s theoretically more efficient to use one OS thread per CPU</i><p>This is not true.<p>In case you&#x27;re not talking about pure CPU-bound tasks, that CPU core will be left at less than 80% usage and you can&#x27;t really have pure CPU-bound tasks (even CPU-bound tasks have to wait for I/O, even if asynchronously, which at the very least involves interactions with the kernel). This depends of course, but if you&#x27;ve got a CPU core that&#x27;s used at less than full capacity, then there&#x27;s room for another thread or two on that core. Which is why the optimal default configuration for CPU-bound tasks are thread-pools with a number of threads that&#x27;s 2 times the number of CPU cores, which is a reasonable default left to be improved by real profiling.<p>Also, blocked threads DO NOT consume CPU resources. The real problem is when those threads wake up, participating in context switching. Which is why, if you&#x27;ve got threads blocking for I/O, it&#x27;s not a problem if you have 100-200 threads that mostly sleep, waiting on some resource to be available.<p>To give you an example, on top of the JVM it&#x27;s not a problem if JDBC is based on blocking I/O. You can have like a thread-pool that waits for SQL queries to execute and when the result comes in, you pass the results to another thread-pool meant for CPU-bound tasks. That&#x27;s why well-grown JVM application are using at least 2 thread-pools to execute tasks - one for CPU-bound tasks with a size directly proportional to the number of CPU cores and one meant for I/O bound tasks, which is unrelated to the number of CPU cores. As an aside, doing this is also good for avoiding dead-locks from combinations of CPU-bound and I/O bound tasks interacting with each other on the same thread-pool.<p>BTW, there isn&#x27;t a single platform that went with M:N threading without regrets. That&#x27;s because you can easily build M:N cooperative multi-threading on top of 1:1 preemtive multi-threading, but this doesn&#x27;t work the other way around.",1388360003

Ground jammers like WARLOCK also don&#x27;t block all IEDs.  One thing they did do was force a lot of command detonated IEDs to go to command wire systems, instead of various wireless systems, which meant we then had a man with a switch in his hand within a few hundred meters (tops), who we then lit the fuck up before or after the attack.  Sure beats someone being in another city with a cellphone!<p>Just because something isn&#x27;t 100% effective doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s worthless.<p>2) Yes, UAVs are offensive combat weapons, particularly the programs in Horn of Africa and Pakistan.  OTOH, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in getting killed by a Hellfire from a drone vs. having guys from JSOC show up at your door.  There&#x27;s a legitimate concern that UAVs lower the threshold to engage in ongoing low intensity conflict, but in the cases where they do have the right targets, I see no difference between drone, manned aircraft, or on the ground trigger-pullers.<p>3) The vast majority of drones are pure Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. DOD didn&#x27;t even arm their drones for a long long time, it was CIA (who operate in those places) who pioneered armed Predators (then the other armed drones).  Part of this is internal politics (pilots = officers), part of it is that when you&#x27;ve got manned aircraft armed with diverse weapons systems orbiting overhead, you can just use a smaller/cheaper/lighter drone for pure ISR, then when you develop a target, send the manned aircraft with a full suite of weapons to choose from to do the actual attack mission.<p>4) The grainy image of a UAV camera, over a 4h monitoring mission, is probably way beyond the standard of proof of a combat shooting in general.  The UAV defaults to &quot;no shoot&quot;.  A soldier in combat who is threatened defaults to &quot;shoot&quot;.  You don&#x27;t need high precision on a single image if you&#x27;re able to spend a long time watching, gathering supporting information (knowing the area, vehicles that approach, etc.).  This isn&#x27;t law enforcement or civilian self defense; it&#x27;s war.

Here the Guardian is just serving up an emotional, unsubstantiated, one sided view of this discussion. I&#x27;m not sure how this is different to much of the chest beating I&#x27;d see on Fox News. I&#x27;m not here to argue for or against the drones. Just that if we pride ourselves on being educated and critical thinkers that we apply that to all sources of data we read.<p>I had some of the same reactions that it seemed like some of it was hijacking anti-war for anti-drone. I would be upset with the guardian if they received this and did not run it. I don&#x27;t know what their back-and-forth process would be in editing this.<p>> We all know war is hell. We know using weapons to attack people creates horrific, real human harm. So starting off listing the effects of weaponry on humans tells us nothing about drones. It just tells us about the horrors of war. Given this is an article about drones it should be very drone specific.<p>Right, so let&#x27;s not be too quick to accept that drone warfare and traditional warfare are the same thing. It&#x27;s very important to distinguish and consider what is new. You can read into a bit and see she&#x27;s not just listing the effects of weaponry on humans. Considering her vantage point through a screen, and mental state during and after the attacks, her &quot;how many X have you seen&quot; questions are very drone specific. For one thing, she probably has orders more Xs than anyone in a traditional combat position. For another, the non-threatened state in which she killed another is important. I think her questions help me see her witnessing the carnage.<p>> Do drones increase or decrease the inevitable horrors of war? I suspect they decrease it with smaller more targeted bombs vs prior more traditional larger bombs. Today if we make a mistake we bomb the wrong home and kill everyone. 25 years ago we bombed the entire village. Maybe they increase it because we&#x27;re carrying out a lot more sorties than we did prior when a jet and a pilot were needed/at risk. However, I&#x27;m not sure and this article goes nowhere close to helping with the discussion.<p>I would say they increase human suffering and hide horror. I think that your suspicion that it decreases horror goes along with horror being hidden. &quot;A lot more sorties&quot; needs to be discussed before dismissing this as not helping. When you bomb an entire village, it&#x27;s in a war zone and everyone on both sides is damned certain of what happened and the outcome. Here we bomb several more houses, in areas that aren&#x27;t even war zones, because our intel is &quot;better&quot; and our strikes are more &quot;precise&quot;. The enemies, locations, and outcomes are undefined and unchecked, hard to see. And since the attacks are smaller and more secretive, visibility is reduced. There is little public visibility or scrutiny on our side. It&#x27;s not war as usual. It starts to tend toward the whole planet being a theater of war rather than any one specific place. It&#x27;s horrifying.<p>So drones are used outside of designated war zones and in non-traditional combat. Then i&#x27;m not convinced that &quot;Do drones increase or decrease the inevitable horrors of war&quot; is the right question. But the article adds firsthand account that the feedback systems are very low bandwidth and easily make mistakes. It adds firsthand experience of psychological damage that operators suffer. These both help with discussion around that question.<p>> &quot;The view is so pixelated it makes decisions tough&quot; Can you imagine military people who fight/fought on the ground in real combat and order in strikes reading that? Surrounded by smoke and fire and deafening noise and hoping (or maybe not caring) that the strike they call in hits the right target/s vs all the nearby civilians also hiding and cowering in a village?<p>Exactly, &quot;maybe not caring&quot;. I think justification would be easier in a situation like that: in battle, with smoke around, on something resembling a battlefield, a well-defined enemy. I think i that the less i was threatened, the more guilt and psychological damage i would suffer later for an incorrect kill.<p>Add in to the mix the fact that we are serving hellfires to peoples faces using the same low-bandwidth, inhuman triggers we might use to serve ads to their faces (signature strikes), it&#x27;s really a new problem. Precision in space and time doesn&#x27;t matter much without precision in intelligence. The bandwidth, confidence, and human involvement must be very high on killing system like this, as they&#x27;re used in scenarios that have little to do with traditional battlefields. The &quot;so pixelated&quot; argument helps us see this and should not be dismissed in the way that you are dismissing it, by saying it&#x27;s harder for boots in combat to make decisions in limited visibility.<p>> Lastly, imagine how you&#x27;d feel reading a similar opinion piece on Fox News from a gun ho former operator talking about all the American lives he saved by observing and taking out &quot;the bad guys&quot;. What&#x27;s even better with drones we&#x27;re not losing American solider lives and dramatically reducing the number of innocent civilians killed vs how we would have approached the same problem just 25 years ago.<p>> War is hell. The issues are complex. Trusted new sources add to the debate. Biased ones feed their viewership what they know they&#x27;ll eat up and do little, maybe even damage, the search for truth.<p>Firsthand experience of the suffering caused is good to hear about. Repeatedly stating &quot;War is hell&quot; seems to accept that we are only discussing legitimate war situations. It&#x27;s not so easy to skip to &quot;War is hell&quot; in the war on terror. Without visibility or even statistics about what&#x27;s going on, i&#x27;m ok with seeing anything that raises awareness. I&#x27;d like to see the pot stirred a bit on this one. With human beings, i&#x27;d like to err on the side of caution. Worst case is it&#x27;s biased as heck and it causes discussion and justification. I wish one of my concerns was that We the People could accidentally dismantle or harm a highly effective and necessary drone program.<p>Edited to fix an assumption about author.",1388359345

6981960,comment,6977177,6977914,2,0,iambvk,,,"Thanks for sharing your experience.<p>I went through the callback-hell problem myself and came to the conclusion that swapcontext is the only way to go. I am starting to begin a large personal project that will be entirely based on swapcontext model (but using boost::coroutine), so I would like to know more from your experience before I invest into possibly the wrong model.  Since you haven&#x27;t explained your solution in-detail, I have a question:<p>Did you use multiple N:M schedulers (each owning an isolated group of os-threads) or your entire process uses a single N:M threading library that owns all os-threads of the process?<p>Here is what I am doing:<p>My project does lot of disk and network IO. So, IMO, being able to keep CPU, Disk and Network busy is my design goal. Having a single N:M scheduler that handles all threads makes it very difficult to understand/analyze/manage the system performance, so I made the choice of having multiple N:M schedulers (that communicate through message passing), each deals with separate resources of the system. For example, os-threads of a N:M cpu-scheduler will only do compute work and when a disk (or network) io is necessary, the greenlet/task/whatever will be queued into the disk-io-scheduler (or network-io-scheduler). When the os-threads of disk-io-scheduler (or network-io-scheduler) finish the io, they queue the greenlet/task back into the cpu-scheduler.<p>This IMO keeps managing/analyzing/tuning the system performance and complexity little easy. For example,<p>> All of a sudden you&#x27;re forced to write a userspace scheduler and guess what it&#x27;s really hard to write a scheduler that&#x27;s going to do a better job that Linux&#x27;s schedules that has man years of efforts put into it. Now you want your schedule to man N green threads to M physical threads so you have to worry about synchronization. Synchronization brings performance problems so you start now you&#x27;re down a new lockless rabbit hole. Building a correct highly concurrent scheduler is no easy task.<p>Agreed, writing a good scheduler that deals with mixed workloads is very challenging. In my model, I am hoping that a poor scheduler wouldn&#x27;t be an issue because, os-threads in the cpu-scheduler are only competing for cpu-bound tasks; similarly os-threads of io-scheduler are only competing for io-bound tasks. The real scheduling between io and cpu operations is still left to the kernel (because kernel decides to pick which scheduler&#x27;s os-thread to run.) From kernel point of view there are threads that only do IO work or threads that only do CPU work. I am not yet sure if kernel schedulers are optimized for such workload or not.<p>> A lot of 3rd party code doesn&#x27;t work great with userspace threads. You end up with very subtle bugs in you code that are hard to track down. In many cases this is due to assumptions about TLS (but this isn&#x27;t the only reasons). In order to make it work you now can&#x27;t have work stealing between your native threads and then you end up with performance problems and starvation problems.<p>My design-solution to this is to segregate 3rd party code into a fixed set of threads that do not ever participate in N:M threading library. Would that solve the above issues?<p>> The final nail in the coffin for me was disk IO. The fact is that non network IO is generally blocking and no OS has great non-blocking disk IO interfaces (windows is best but it&#x27;s still not great). First, it&#x27;s pretty low level, eg. difficult to use. You have to do IO on block boundaries. Second, it bypasses the page cache (at least on Linux) which in most cases kills performance right there. And in many cases this non-blocking interface will end up blocking (even on windows) if the filesystem needs to do certain things under the covers (like extend the file or load metadata). Also, the way these operations are implement require a lot lot of syscalls thus context switches which further negate any perceived performance benefits. The bottom line is that regular blocking IO (better yet mmaped IO) outperforms what most people are capable of achieving using the non-blocking disk IO facilities.<p>Yes, lot of disk/file-system operations do not have non-blocking equivalents. This is one of the main reasons for having a separate disk-io-scheduler (with its own thread-pool) in my design. In my model any blocking-only operation is made asynchronous by queuing the operation into a dedicated io thread pool and let it inform me when the operation is completed. This gives me flexibility in tuning the IO parallelism specific to my needs. For example, SSD can handle more concurrent operations than a HDD, so I can create an ssd-io-scheduler with more number of threads than a hdd-io-scheduler.<p>It would be great if you could share your thoughts on my analysis.

The next time a big study announces (and most likely confirms already expected) gender differences, look at who is doing the study. Check whether the methodology is even half-way sound, if there were enough test subjects and look at how they were recruited. Especially in psychological studies, search for ways the study might have been primed. Also, what&#x27;s the track record of the researchers themselves, is this a study to follow up on previously uttered extreme claims? Look for cultural bias. Look for warning signs such as the invocation of fictitious prehistorical &quot;facts&quot;. Look at the assumptions behind the study, and at the way the media spins the results to conform with accepted stereotypes.<p>In the end, no, you will probably choose to trust people and researchers who already agree with you. But it&#x27;s worth a shot taking a look behind the scenes of these big &quot;scientific explanations&quot; that seem to be evolutionary (=pop) psychological justifications for convenient cultural norms.<p>I am somewhat pessimistic about finding common ground if you self-identify as a religious or conservative person, however, this is a point where we might start:<p>Discard science and evidence, discard models and reasoning, discard culture. Let&#x27;s just talk about people. In the parent post I already talked about female programmers being saddled with additional hurdles. Obviously we can agree that this is a bad thing. The only other thing we should probably agree on is the idea that female voices are somewhat missing in our hacker culture, based on the assertion it&#x27;d be a richer and more prolific culture if we worked even a little bit on seizing the incessant discouragement of women to enter this profession. That&#x27;s really it, the whole thing. I&#x27;m not even talking about this controversial notion of active encouragement, let&#x27;s just stop the discouragement.",1388358885

Personally, I do burpees twice daily, post daily (though I often write many posts per day), and I got this idea while doing cold showers daily for thirty days.<p>Lately I crystallized a lot of daily habits into one overarching concept that I think has a fundamental role in creating success for many types of people in many fields: the Self-Imposed Daily Challenging Healthy Activity, or SIDCHA, which I wrote more about here -- <a href""http://joshuaspodek.com/number-one-best-tool-improve-life-self-imposed-daily-challenging-healthy-activity-sidch"" rel""nofollo"">http://joshuaspodek.com/number-one-best-tool-improve-life-se...</a> -- and will continue to explore.

Here&#x27;s my idea: There&#x27;s nothing stopping cryptocurrencies from eventually becoming centralized. Successful alternative cryptocurrencies will pop up and will be backed by governments or businesses, giving them real value. There will be a market between all cryptocurrencies and centralized currencies will be built on top of that market. Inflation will happen whenever anyone creates a new currency and people want to buy it. So crypto-assets will serve as a base for viable (inflationary) currencies. It wouldn&#x27;t matter if bitcoin or any other individual cryptocurrency succeeds or fails as long as that market remains, and it will due to all of the benefits of cryptocurrencies in general.

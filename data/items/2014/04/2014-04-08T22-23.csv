I&#x27;ve been at companies where we had to switch to their really poor wiki product, Confluence, instead of free and better alternatives because Confluence allowed management to lock down editing permissions on individual pages in a more detailed manner. Note that I then spent weeks trying to get access to write to a page whenever I needed to add something to the company wiki, and weeks trying to get an admin to install a plugin to allow some HTML syntax we needed. So the experience from the user side was absolutely terrible, but it made management happy they got to micromanage all the page write permissions.

7556546,comment,7556074,7556473,8,0,jessriedel,,,"With respect, you sound like you&#x27;re under the very common misconception that top universities are interested in educating the most academically impressive undergrads, and that it&#x27;s a fight between parents to see who can trick the school into thinking their child is among the best students. In fact, universities are driven primarily to increase their influence on the world at large.<p>When hiring professors, this can indeed mean academic acumen is valued, since impressive scholarship shapes the world and brings the university prestige.  At the same time, grant-getting abilities are very important, since you can use money to buy influence in lots of ways.<p>When selecting undergrads, academic ability has some instrumental value but very little intrinsic value to the university.  This is because academic-superstar undergrads will leave the university before they exert influence with their scholarship.  The universities <i>does</i> wants to mold the minds of future powerful people, and that usually means looking for students who are fairly (though not necessarily outrageously) smart.<p>But to first order, you can think of the undergraduate program at top universities as a pure money-making venture.  The first strategy used is near-perfect price discrimination to maximize immediate returns, i.e. &quot;send us your parent&#x27;s W2s and we&#x27;ll tell you how much you&#x27;ll pay&quot;. (Tuition is extremely high but most students get substantial financial aid.)  The second strategy is to groom an ideal donor pool for long term revenue, and this is primarily composed of a few business superstars with a long tail of doctors, lawyers, and financial folks.<p>These blog posts touch on some of these ideas...<p>Sean Carroll: &quot;The Purpose of Harvard is Not to Educate People&quot; \n<a href=""http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2008/05/29/the-purpose-of-harvard-is-not-to-educate-people/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2008/05/29/the-purp...</a><p>Steve Hsu: &quot;Defining Merit&quot;\n<a href=""http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2009/11/defining-merit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2009/11/defining-merit.html</a>",1396997704

I can&#x27;t imagine doing it this easily, this cleanly and this performant using either C or C++ (I even had fixnums and clojure-like vectors and maps, although not persistent.)<p>There&#x27;s a lot of features to learn, and a lot of ways to use them.

Either you are free to do what you will with what is given to you, or you are not. There is no free with restrictions; that's called a <i>catch</i>.<p>To be clear, too, what the FSF says and what those who subscribe to the belief say are often two different things, as evidenced in other places in this thread.

2227101,comment,2226260,2226994,0,0,jedsmith,,,"> People have a sense of entitlement WRT open source code, I think. As if it's ""open source,"" it should be under whatever terms they want not those of the original author. I think that's why so many people bitch about copyleft licenses.<p>That certainly isn't why I ""bitch,"" as you say, as I realize that the author can do whatever he wishes. I do, however, make it a point to listen to my users; if my users have a philosophical disagreement over my choice of license, I take that into account in decisions on what to license in the future.<p>That's the approach to software that I wish more developers would take: I have listened to your feedback, and I will take it into consideration. Your attitude, which is what I disagree so very strongly with, is that you didn't have to open-source the software at all, your users are lucky that you did, and you'll be damned if you'll consider feedback on your choice of licensing. It's ""take it or leave it,"" which to the occasional user that wants to embed your code in something else, sucks a lot.<p>There's been other comments in this thread to the effect of that ""isn't [your] problem"". If you're not interested in helping consumers of your software use it, why did you release it at all? I realize (believe me) that there is a line that must be drawn when it comes to listening to your users, but responding with ""tough, rewrite it"" is really a bummer to hear.<p>Realistically, I think you're working against yourself with that take on your users.",1297875028

He says that ODF does the same work as OOXML in 1/10th the size.<p>First of all, it does not do the same work. OOXML includes hundreds of pages covering spreadsheet formulas, giving mathematical definitions of them, sample input and output, and detailed descriptions. ODF omits spreadsheet formulas. ODF, as passed by ISO, barely deserves to be called a ""specification"", as there is virtually no chance that two people independently implementing from the spec alone would come up with interoperable documents. It is more accurately thought of as a guide to help understand the OpenOffice source code--which is what you actually would use as your spec if you were trying to write a real-world ODF application.<p>Second, even for those areas where they do the same work, the OOXML spec is more precise. That accounts for much of its size. For instance, consider how dates should be stored. Both ODF and OOXML list specific calendars that must be supported. In the ODF spec, this is a simple list, just giving a short informal name for each. In the OOXML spec, they give a table that gives the short informal name, but also gives the full official name, along with a complete citation to the official definition of that calendar.<p>Or consider password protected documents. All ODF tells you is where to store the password. (It might also say it should be hashed). OOXML covers that, but also tells you what hash formats and encryption systems must be supported, and for each of those cites the appropriate standard.",1297873544

One presenter was using Squeak as an advanced debugger at a company producing a FPS game.  If all your functionality happens between frames, you can rig it so you never GC.  You just throw away all of your memory outside of ""perm"" space every time.<p>With VisualWorks Smalltalk, you can change the settings so that the bulk of your GC work happens using incremental GC.  It's not uncommon to get to the point where GC never takes up more than a few milliseconds.  That's plenty good for most people.  Admittedly that's not so good if your ""light"" request load is well over 1000 transactions per server per second.<p><i>And even if you contrive your app to use memory very very carefully, with a shared runtime with 100 other apps (e.g. on a server) not everybody is as nice and GC still runs/stalls the system.</i><p>When you need enough virtual hosts to be running 100 server processes -- that's likely when you need to be transitioning out of ""rapid prototyping"" mode and onto processes with just a little more rigor.<p>What I'm advocating is a language where both the rapid prototyping and running optimized mature code efficiently is possible.

Guile doesn't do this, no.  I've never understood the desire for this, either; if you want to isolate users, put them in different modules.<p>> Why a C-level GC like Boehm, rather than just track your own garbage?<p>Precisely for embeddability.  Tracking your own garbage is hard in C.  It's doable of course, but very error-prone.  Guile's C API is pretty easy to use (IMO of course).<p>> Why scheme for an embeddable language, don't continuations make C interop hard?<p>We have continuation barriers, but it's true that our historical continuation implementation has been a stack-copying one.  In 2.2 we are likely to move to a model where we just capture the Scheme stack.<p>That said, delimited continuations are really the bee's knees.  See ""Prompts"" in the manual for more.<p>> Even back when they announced Guile, it seemed odd that they based it on SCM rather than on SIOD or TinyScheme.<p>I think the thing was that folks wanted an implementation that could grow into something more substantial.  Which leads to your next point:<p>> Lua seems to be far superior for embedding. Guile seems big and invasive by comparison.<p>The problem is that once you have a nice small language, you start to want to program more and more in it, and you end up with a nice medium-sized language.  You can see that even now with Alex Shinn's Chibi.  It seems to be a hump you have to grow over and then become a nice large language ;-)<p>Lua is wonderful, and they are among the few groups I have heard of that manage to keep things small and lean.

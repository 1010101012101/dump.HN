Programming is a fad / fashion driven industry more than anything.<p>I do not disagree with the latter statement, but for the most part I consider myself a software engineer. I have a degree in CS, and my approach to making components for our systems is very much engineer like. I design, develop, test, evaluate, modify, install, inspect and maintain a system where I have applied science and theory to make to solution work. I have not have the pleasure to work with hardcore mathmaticians yet, but I hope I will some day.<p>I agree that developers that never touch the backbone and algorithms probably aren&#x27;t doing engineering, at least not in the theory and science way, but saying that no developer is an engineer is wrong.",1432103657

Any study with data <i>less</i> thorough than the UHC is even less meaningful.<p>To quote the CQO at my old job, &quot;I have more data than any quality officer has ever had before, and I didn&#x27;t know where to send my wife [for her delivery].&quot;",1375268349
6132868,comment,6132029,6132491,3,0,akie,,,"You make two good points, but only the first one is structural. How do you keep information secure if it&#x27;s meant to be semi-public? That&#x27;s a rather fundamental question, and I don&#x27;t have an answer to it. There must be a better way than storing everything in plain text in a centralized database, though.<p>Just think about it: the current communication tools store all the world&#x27;s communication in plain text databases on American soil. No wonder the NSA engineered access to it - it is a prize too good to be true. I think we can and should at least try to change that.<p>Regarding the availability and use of PGP key pairs and related technology: you&#x27;re right. Almost no one uses them, save for security enthusiasts. They&#x27;re difficult to use, overly technical, make you feel like a paranoid conspiracy theorist and are frankly a pain. Those are all issues that could be overcome, though. There are no real, actual, structural reasons why good security has to be difficult to use.<p>But what I&#x27;m really wondering about is the best way forward. Like I said, I would strongly prefer a political solution, but I&#x27;m skeptical if that will ever pan out. I&#x27;ve been mulling this for a while, and if we would really want decentralized, encrypted, open source means of communications, shouldn&#x27;t we take a structural approach to this?",1375268330

Why do I want to know? Well it depends on the purpose of the site, but for the most part it is so that I can optimise and improve what my site offers to you and others.<p>But you&#x27;ve politely requested that I don&#x27;t track you. For starters this should only ever be a polite request, not a forced rejection of any tracking scripts. I have a right to track how people use my site. You have a right to privacy, but that&#x27;s got bugger all to do with you coming on to my site, once you&#x27;ve made that choice you are within my domain, under my roof, living by my rules. Until you leave of course.<p>Some sites may respect that request, but they&#x27;re the kind of site who have no need to track behaviour anyhow, and are likely not tracking to begin with. kind of makes the request moot.<p>People get way too offended by analytics tracking when it&#x27;s there for their benefit. The internet would be one ugly place if webmasters and designers had no clue how people were interacting with it. If you want to go back to the dark ages then feel free to try. But you won&#x27;t benefit from the advances we&#x27;ve made or are yet to make because of large scale, anonymous tracking across the web.<p>I&#x27;ve no respect for Do Not Track. It is a silly, backwards, progress-endangering concept that should be burnt on a pyre.<p>Think of a scenario where a site is maliciously tracking you, where a forced browser level request could to not track be sent, and maybe we&#x27;ll talk. But then again I&#x27;ll probably just retort that any malicious tracking will have a way around such a forced request, and so it&#x27;s pointless.<p>Do Not Track is snake oil for the conscientious objector.",1375267915

If the transaction ever reaches an unresolved dispute, it would be possible for the site owners to simply move that single address to their &quot;long-term retirement fund^W^W backup system&quot;, instead of simply deleting it. At that point, if the system ever shuts down, the owners can then simply move (in reality: shuffle) all the supposedly destroyed funds to their own accounts.<p>Apparently one can send bitcoins to any address, and an existing address becomes public only when it is used in a transaction. So the fund destruction can&#x27;t just be a transaction to a so far unknown address - that would, again, allow the site owners to use their own addresses for the purpose.<p>After thinking this through a bit, it seems to me that the only way to really prove that the funds are destroyed would be to send them to an all-zero address. While thinking about this, a friend came up with the idea of spending the destroyed funds exclusively on transaction fees. I don&#x27;t know why, but I have a weird feeling that could still be subject to gaming the system somehow.<p>A fascinating idea for a service, nonetheless.",1375266953

I can absolutely see a value in the Quip way of doing things, but not for a large enterprise with high volume and complex documents, not to mention the common use case of taking a native binary doc of some sort and uploading+converting to Drive format.  The SMB use cases you use as examples are spot-on, but don&#x27;t mesh with my needs as an administrator of a 20,000 person domain with 800,000 documents online.  I also wouldn&#x27;t pay $12/user/month for Quip when I could get all of the rest of Google Apps for only $50ish.<p>Another question I&#x27;d have is what your long term plan is.

  vpand   xmm9, xmm9, xmm15
  vpshufb xmm8, xmm0, xmm8
  vpshufb xmm9, xmm0, xmm9
  vpaddb  xmm8, xmm8, xmm9

  vpshufb xmm7, xmm8, xmm8 ; since sum <= 12, we already have the next sum in the vector!
                           ; xmm7[0] = xmm8[xmm8[0]]

The best way to learn git is to start using it for every coding exercise.<p>2. Yes, that&#x27;s the Rails tutorial.<p>3. Is the dev academy Ruby-focused, JS-focused, or something else? Because I would most certainly NOT recommend you try to learn multiple languages concurrently. Whatever language is the focus of the dev academy, master that one. So no, don&#x27;t learn Python/any other languages concurrently. (HTML and CSS are not programming languages. They are markup languages and it is assumed that any web developer has basic proficiency in them). The one exception is you usually need to know some JS. So if, for example, the dev academy does Ruby, you&#x27;ll still probably be taught JS. But as far as self-teaching goes, focus on the language that&#x27;s the focus of the dev academy. Master that first.<p>4. You&#x27;re missing my junior developer point. &quot;Upstart&quot; and &quot;journeyman&quot; are all synonyms of &quot;junior.&quot; My point is that you should not give such a blatant indication that you are junior in any way.

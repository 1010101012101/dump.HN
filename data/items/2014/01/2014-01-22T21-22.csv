How does that work?&quot;).  Once we get people using the app, it is very easy to get them to put in a credit card.  One way we encourage them to put in a credit card is with a free trial countdown at the top of the screen that gives them special offers if they put in a credit card on certain days (e.g. 14 days left, get a freebie if you enter a credit card).  One thing that is unique about our app is that it has residual value even if you don&#x27;t convert, because you can opt in to still receive alerts.  Each alert gives us another chance to convert a former free trial, and to date the record for latest conversion is 100 days after trial ended.",1390427763

It was feature-frozen at 3.0, and the only changes made now are bugfixes.<p>The problem arrises when the things your program depends on go away. For example, if you have a project that is written for Ruby 1.8.7, after June of this year, that version will receive no more updates. If there&#x27;s some particular feature of 1.8.7 that you depend on, or some bug found, or some security vulnerability discovered, users might eventually find themselves in a spot of bother.<p>The web of dependencies for most projects is bewilderingly complex. The stacks that we write for are moving targets, and unless your software is moving to keep up, eventually there&#x27;s a good chance that they just wont run any more.<p>This sort of thinking is why the IETF publishes Internet Drafts as ASCII-only text files.

The app also includes a software licenses section so you can store those credentials in the app if you choose.

In fact, it could give a good way for AMD to get back into the performance desktop market as well -- given the leaks on how the arch is going to have three sets of pcie 3 lanes for single/dual proc machines, I can very much see AMD leapfrogging in terms of getting 3+-way crossfire rigs for people who want ridiculous gaming machines.

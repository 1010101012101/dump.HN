5675349,comment,5674230,5674726,3,0,mikeash,,,"Regarding the Greek cafe, there are plenty of crazy regulations like that in the US, usually centered around alcohol.<p>For example, in Virginia (where I live), ordinary stores can sell beer and wine, but nothing harder. Liquor can only be sold in state-run stores. I suppose the intent is to discourage consumption of hard liquor... and it seems to work on me. The state-run stores are inconvenient enough that I go for softer fare instead of tracking one down.<p>I knew a couple who bought a gas station and turned half of the convenience store part into a restaurant, while keeping the convenience store part open as well. They had a license to sell alcohol, but not a license to <i>serve</i> alcohol. You could go over to the convenience store half and buy a six-pack of beer, but you couldn't get a beer in the restaurant, and you couldn't bring the beer you had just purchased.<p>I recently moved into a newly-constructed house. One of my neighbors had to delay their move-in date by a couple of days, because the builder forgot to paint the curb yellow behind the house to indicate that it was a fire lane, and the county wouldn't give them an occupancy permit. This street has plenty of ""fire lane"" signs, has very little curb at all (it's mostly driveways), and nobody in their right mind would park on it, but it had to be done. The builder rushed the job, and a few months later, basically all of the paint has flaked away and nobody seems to care. Somehow, this was unacceptably unsafe when we were moving in, but it's fine now....<p>The Greek example sounds worse, but of course a singular example is hard to draw a lesson from.

This isn't the case, at least not originally. Wiretapping laws were about protecting citizens from each other. Let me explain:<p>Once upon a time, it was too expensive to run a phone line to each house. AT&T had the brilliant idea of running one phone line and having many people on a street share the line (the rich, of course, enjoyed private communications). So if there were seven houses, and you were in house number 5, you would only answer calls that rang 5 times. The problem is that since all the houses on the block shared one phone line, any one nosy enough to but in could eavesdrop just by taking their phone off hook. The original wiretapping laws were setup to protect citizens from this, not the Government.<p>As a side note: before the North American Numbering plan, phone numbers were names followed by numbers. An example might be Oxford7 or OX7 on the number pad, which would ring the 7th house in the Oxford area (Oxford is a placeholder and doesn't refer to Oxford proper.)",1368031961

Would countries that employ child labor be slingshotted into the first-world because they adopted effective regulations? I speculate they'd be unemployed and go hungry.</i><p>Only I made the reverse argument: that countries without child labour should not introduce it to compete with those countries.<p>And in general, that countries with higher working standards should not lower them to compete with third world countries, dictatorships etc, in a race to the bottom.<p>But, to also answer your question, I'd rather they go hungry than they use child labor, if that were the two options. Would you be OK with forced labor, ie slavery, if that was their only way to be competitive and not ""go hungry""?<p>All this is a false dichotomy you set up anyway. It's not ""child labor"" vs ""hungry"". Child labor is not employed because it's their only hope to compete, it's merely employed because they lack the regulations to enforce otherwise. If the employers in that country (and the huge multinationals that contract them) could not take advantage of 12 year old children in sweatshops, they'd pay a little more and employ their parents.<p>It's not a case of ""we can compete any other way"". It's a case, ""Hey, the laws here allow me to fuck over these people for an increased profit, so why not do it?"".<p>><i>Again, how do you know? Did Michael Moore tell you?</i><p>Well, for one I'm not an American, and I have far wider horizons than Michael Moore. Should I also assume a caricature of you as some Fox News watching foaming at the mouth republican? It would be of similar quality and subtlety to your Michael Moore thing. Quite provincial, are we?<p>Anyway, no Michael didn't tell me. Not being provincial, following world economy news, a quite extensive reading on the matter, and travelling (but not as some naive first world tourist), ""told me"".<p>> It means that the ""benefits of a globalised economy"" are mainly for company owners, moguls, managers, golden boys and the like, and more often praised than seen in reality.

The typical use case is where CardFlight is installed on a merchant device and the consumer's card is physically present at the time of purchase.  For example:<p>- An event management and ticketing solution.  As part of their event management app for checking guests in, they will give event organizers the ability to seamlessly sell an event ticket from within the app.
- CRM apps looking to handle field sales while keeping the payment and CRM solution integrated.
- Non-profit/fundraising apps looking to take donations on the spot.
- Tablet POS software developers looking for an easy way to integrate payments (without having to do their own hardware SDK integrations, building secure/PCI-compliant payment handling from scratch, processor integration, etc.)",1368031422

It is also necessary to have common rules and regulations for the goods and services sold throughout the common market. If that weren't the case, individual countries could easily erect trade barriers between them (through rules that are mutually exclusive, e.g. so that a Spanish manufacturer of wine harvesters can't export her Spanish harvesters to France, at least not without massively changing the production process and in essence opening two manufacturing lines, one for Spain, one for France).<p>So the EU parliament gets this stack of laws on fruits from 27 countries and is told to turn that into one unified law for the whole of the EU.

There are plenty of open source photo albums (even packaged for Debian stable, my distro of choice), but so far I hadn't found any that offer mobile clients to automate things. While I'm not on Android, the wife is, and this looks like an awesome way to let her share photos, while still keeping them under her control. I'm also very glad to see that Trovebox is open source, and will be mirror cloning the repos soon :)",1368029484

5675014,comment,5662138,5673494,1,0,dpark,,,"The only meaningful measure of the server's state is in how it expresses that state via the communications protocol.  As a client, what the server does internally is irrelevant, so long as it behaves consistently when I talk to it.<p>I find it farfetched that the spec authors would specify that an HTTP-compliant server should not do something completely unexpected in the face of a DELETE on a nonexistent resource.  What's the alternative to ""internal idempotency"" here?  To randomly restore the deleted item?  To delete something else instead?  Anything other than ""note that the item is already gone and return"" would be a bug.  So why would anyone put this in the spec?  They wouldn't, which is why the spec is clearly discussing idempotency with respect to the communications, and not with respect to the server's internal state (which again is not something the RFC mandates).<p>On the other hand, the RFC does specifically call out that clients should automatically retry idempotent operations in the event of a closed connection, which makes no sense if the communications will not be idempotent.  The RFC also calls out that internal state may be changed in the face of an idempotent (and even a safe) operation, another indication that what's being specified is not internal server behavior/state (because if it's mutating state it's not internally idempotent).<p>> <i>the client does something it shouldn't (for example, calling DELETE on a resource that no longer exists)</i><p>You're begging the question by assuming that a client should not call DELETE on a nonexistent resource.  It's perfectly valid to interpret ""DELETE"" to mean ""make sure nothing exists at this URL"" (I believe the RFC does), in which case a delete of a nonexistent item is a successful call.",1368029468

5674959,comment,5671652,5674370,2,0,ufo,,,"One way you could do it is by using mutable state. Impure languages, such as Scheme or Ocaml, let you use mutable like normal imperative languages do and in Haskell you can use mutable references inside some special monads (and you even ave more than one kind of mutalbe reference, depending on what monad you are on: IORef, STRef, etc)<p>The other way is to not use state. If you squint a bit, you can see that if you explicitly encode your ""state"" as function arguments you can kind of update it by calling the function recursively:<p><pre><code>   go 0 acc = acc
   go n acc = go (n-1) (n * acc)

   fact n = go n 1
</code></pre>
In the previous example, the code I wrote does exactly the same thing as the usual imperative loop might have done, but the accumulator is a parameter on the helper function instead of being a mutable variable.<p>In general, if you are OK with this kind of non-destructive updates that I used here, you can encode all your state as extra parameters that you thread around your functions. You can do this by hand in most cases but in some situations the state is very pervasive and correctly threading it around can be complex and error prone. In that case, you can look into use things like the State monad (not to be confused with the ST monad!) to do that implicitly pass that parameter around for you.",1368028805

vehicles requires significant capital, so without a business, there's no
viable way to make the desired advancements.<p>Some of the backlash against Elon Musk seems to be caused by some people
having extremely high expectations for everything he does. Those
expectations are occasionally unrealistic, and blaming him personally
for every misgiving of the entire Tesla company is entirely unfair.<p>Most car sales/lease terms are horribly and intentionally confusing and
complicated, but someone in marketing at Tesla made a serious mistake.
The mistake wasn't using industry norm of difficult to comprehend
claims and terms, instead, the mistake was failing to live up to
expectations of something better, namely, clear and direct terms with
fair and easy comparisons.<p>As a business, Tesla must compete with all of the entrenched businesses
but by using the ""best practices"" of the industry in terms of marketing,
they missed an opportunity and failed to meet expectations. There are
few people on the planet who have set expectations so high as to get
blamed personally for failing to innovate absolutely everywhere, but it
seems Elon Musk is one of them.<p>The world would be a better place if more people had his problems. ;-)",1365407801

5510446,comment,5509431,5509583,3,0,rbehrends,,,"Eh ... relatively speaking. In theory, both the EPC and German law do not allow patents for software ""as such"".<p>This has been translated by the courts into a requirement that the invention have a ""technical character"" [1]. This means in particular that where there is a mixed software/hardware invention the inventive step has to be related to the <i>direct</i> manipulation of controllable forces of nature.<p>Initially, this was used in a fairly straightforward way. A piece of pure business software was considered to be not patentable, computer-controlled anti-lock brakes were considered patentable [2]. More generally, it had been considered to rule out practically all application programs on a general purpose computer.<p>However, in the decades since then, these limitations have been watered down more and more without having been officially abandoned. Examples of inventions that were categorized as patentable later was a cache algorithm (because it made more efficient use of the underlying hardware, even though that claim seemed somewhat tenuous) or a CAD/CAM program (because it allowed you to avoid constructing a prototype) [2].<p>While it would be correct to say that German and European patent law is somewhat more restrictive than American patent law, the inconsistent jurisprudence has created a huge gray area, which makes it difficult to predict which inventions will hold up in court and which won't. In Germany, some of the harsher critics attribute that to personnel changes at the X. Civil Senate of the Federal Court of Justice (the panel that deals with patent law cases): namely, as justices changed, the underlying theories of patentability that the court used changed and were never properly reconciled. I cannot say whether this is correct, but it would explain a lot. See also the comments by Lord Justice Jacobs in Aerotel v. Telco, paragraphs 129-131 [3] (which are about as critical as one national court allows itself to be of another: ""For reasons we confess we do not fully understand the BGH considered that the case was not concerned with the computer program as such exclusion."").<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patentable_subject_matter#Practice_at_the_European_Patent_Office"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patentable_subject_matter#Pract...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.it-law.at/uploads/tx_publications/Patentschutz_fuer_Software.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.it-law.at/uploads/tx_publications/Patentschutz_fu...</a> (in German)<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2006/1371.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2006/1371.html</a>",1365407118

And you have to watch her."" What is a father to do? He has never taken care of a baby by himself, let alone a baby girl. But he confidently agrees that it's time for her to go. He's a man, of course he is confident in his abilities! But we all know, right when the wife leaves, baby wilma will sense it and freak out and shriek in terror.<p>Many fathers have been in this situation. And when they are, they need a solution. The PeekABoo Bear app (http://itunes.apple.com/app/peek-a-boo-boo-bear/id501788281?mt=8) is that solution. Open the app, set it next to baby wilma and watch as she giggles in anticipation for the cute little bear to say PeekABoo. And if the father is slick, they will have had there wife record some sweet that the bear can say for baby wilma.<p>PeekABoo Bear was developed by Benerino Studios (www.BenerinoStudios.com) out of Gangplank in Chandler, AZ. The voice of the bear was done by the owners little daughter. Since its release, peekaboo Bear has been downloaded in 53 different countries, with Japan and the USA downloading it the most times.<p>As the reviews with attest to, It's a great app for kids with some simple animation. But it keeps kids happy and they enjoy it a bunch. Version 2.0 will be coming out soon, with clothes to dress the bear up in and more cute characters. But for now, you can keep little baby wilma quiet by opening the app, setting it next to her and watching her giggle in anticipation for the bear to say PeekABoo.<p>Ben Hall

5510421,comment,5509956,5509956,2,0,just2n,,,"Plenty of good advice here. Not to disagree with industry standard methods of getting around browser connection limits by parallelizing requests over many domain names, but this is something I've long felt uneasy about. It feels like one of the biggest, ugliest hacks that exists in basic website performance optimization techniques.<p>SPDY and now HTTP2 solve this problem with multiplexing and pipelining, but it seems like an obvious addition to lump in with chunked encoding and persistent connections. We have the benefit of hindsight now, but that does still seem like a clear oversight.<p>This mistake and its workarounds has lead to websites being much more latent and DNS lookups being more apparent in page loading performance (forcing a meta hack around that problem, too), and now that the connection speed is rarely the limiting factor, this is one of the most glaring perf failures in the design of the spec. When I look at how we get around browser connection limits and the fact that HTTP is inherently serial in its requests, I can't help but feel overwhelmed with disgust at how massive a hack this is.",1365406582

They taught me that I deserve to know what goes on underneath the software I use. Softice, IDA and w32dasm were the tools of the trade. But most of it were limited to finding where the MessageBox with the trial message pops up and reversing the conditional jump just before it. Here is a small tutorial teaching how to reverse and remove the trial limitation of an ancient version of UltraEdit : <a href=""http://71.6.196.237/fravia/uedilas.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://71.6.196.237/fravia/uedilas.htm</a><p>But after switching to a fully opensource stack, reverse engineering lost its charm. Understanding how things work is taken for granted and I can't imagine going back to an opaque proprietary environment.<p>Fravia passed away on 2009; but his archives are preserved here: <a href=""http://71.6.196.237/fravia/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://71.6.196.237/fravia/index.htm</a>",1365404557

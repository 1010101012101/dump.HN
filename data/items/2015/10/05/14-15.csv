The government does not ask for your money, nor does it encourage you to donate money at the mosques. Say what you want about the Saudis, Hajj is not seen from a pure profitability standpoint as far as I can see.",1444057187

I can second that what datenwolf said is pretty darn accurate, but doesn&#x27;t account for a lot of the inteference that happens to reduce usability of the specturm.<p>You also get into beam widths so and antenna.  So if you have 700 satellites up in the air given full spectrum that means they&#x27;d have a fixed limit of 10TBit/s.  That can be divided between their users (but it won&#x27;t be anything close to 10TBit/s).<p>So this will really be a factor of how big their beams are, how many people are within their beams, and how much frequency they can legally use.  While this is really cool and possible, I doubt this will open up a whole new internet in it&#x27;s first pass.<p>There is also the issue with, how are they going to get the signal to it&#x27;s destination?  They can&#x27;t beam it all the way around the world for you, and from what I understand at least OneWeb isn&#x27;t going to communicate from satellite to satellite.  So they&#x27;ll have to have a ton of ground stations to receive your link and then send it over fiber, or transmit up to GEO, then down again.   OR they&#x27;ll have to hop up and down between nodes to it&#x27;s destination, in a similar fashion to TOR.  I don&#x27;t know how they plan to solve this or if SpaceX has a better solution.",1444057185

China already has a political rating system it&#x27;s called 档案(Personal Record File). Actually it has acted a crucial part in Chinese society, individual themselves aren&#x27;t allowed to access their own file, and records inputs we given by their supervisors. You will have your record with you since elementary school, or even earlier. It was serious in 80s and early 90s where state owns everything, you can imagine how hard for an individual to live back in the old days. Since private firms became the mainstream and acts an important role in the Chinese economic structure, these files are no longer required for private owners. As of today, it&#x27;s only important if you work for state owned units, but it still works, and alive.<p>If the totalitarian government wants to make a political evaluation system, they can just make use of 档案, plus minus Internet surveillance data they gathered all the time. There&#x27;s no need of data from any parts that Alibaba(NASDAQ:BABA) owns, Weibo(NASDAQ:WB) is the most influential social network in China, but a local government/state-owned companies easily take down any information they think inappropriate. They do have have read/write privileges to these information, not to mention other minor ones. As for data mining, not a problem, given the resource they have.<p>Also they don&#x27;t need something like a smokescreen, or justification for that, since there&#x27;s already a similar system working, it&#x27;s easier to maintain that start a new one.<p>Sesame is merely a joke in the game of privacy-invasion, or credit scoring. Consumers don&#x27;t care about their sesame score, since they can&#x27;t make use of it. The imaginary party they &#x27;are trying to serve&#x27; in the article, doesn&#x27;t need them. Though the Aligroup tried to do some evil, but was too dubious and obvious. Last time they tried really hard to do some evil deeds and do crossed some lines by calling your friends telling them your purchases when you have overdue bills for sometime[1]. Things like such makes people question their capabilities of being evil, also ability to score people&#x27;s credit correctly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.zhihu.com/question/35586955"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zhihu.com/question/35586955</a> (Chinese)",1444057183

There may be a revolution in web design; a &quot;cool looking complicated&quot; web page might cost 5 megs of javascript and graphics and that might cost a blogger $5/mo if less than 1000 visit per month, but if the blogger gets famous for actual content (as opposed to web design) then once the blogger hits the 1M visits per month big leagues, shrinking the page from 5M to 5K might save the blogger a factor of a thousand in hosting costs.  I don&#x27;t think web designers will be happy about this; then again they won&#x27;t be paying the bills.  This will lead to something like the ancient &quot;adobe flash&quot; effect where the fancier a web page is designed and appears, the less likely it is to contain useful content, so it can be skipped, and the less complicated a page looks, the better the content it serves.<p>Another way the economics of the model would work is a trivial extension that probes all links at rendering time and if the link comes up as payment required the link is eaten.  Currently I have to remember to ignore NYT links; in the future with the new extension I won&#x27;t even see NYT links.<p>Another model that may develop is content that sellers want, like glowing &quot;independent&quot; reviews of a restaurant, might go away (relatively speaking) in a consumer oriented internet.  This works on all levels from very small to very large, the advertisers pay for Gawker no matter if I look at it or not, given supposed levels of click fraud.  Without the advertisers, if we don&#x27;t look at Gawker it simply goes away.  Rephrased and simplified, now you can push something no one likes except the advertisers if the advertisers pay for it, but in a future internet economy if you push something no one likes, you&#x27;d better be prepared to pay for it by yourself.  That might have interesting socioeconomic class issues WRT widening income inequality; all billionaires will have blogs, no poor people will, and a way to filter college applications to make sure the &quot;right&quot; people are let in would be to require blog submission instead of traditional essay submission or the other socioeconomic filters we use now like extracurriculars or disaster tourism, etc.",1444056786

I should be able to do this outside of an object if I want to.<p>So a subscription needs a method to call when the value changes. And the method needs to pass the new value.<p>Being unsubscribed isn&#x27;t enough because if I really care about the object I need to know when it goes away, not just be magically unsubscribed from it and continuing in my own little fantasy land where the object still exists.<p>Edit:<p>Continuing the thought, I think the model needs two protocols -- a publisher and a subscriber. The subscriber automatically cancels subscriptions when it goes away and the publisher automatically cancels subscriptions when it goes away. The information passed in a given case is simply what object and property I am subscribing to (since, as a subscriber I already know who I am, and the information can be encapsulated without being passed).",1444056045

Countries want to avoid this and if the cost is diverting a few percent of their GDP to the USA&#x27;s drug companies they likely will do so.  If however that diversion because too great they will have huge incentive to decide the cost is too high and we have to fight the USA&#x27;s governments policies put in place at the behest of their drug companies.<p>The costs will be enormous to the countries that fight, especially at first.  The USA is enormously rich and can accept losses internally and use economic power to punish those defying it&#x27;s dictates.<p>If several rich countries decide to align with India (which seems to be by far the leading advocate for fighting the copyright/patent cartel) costs to the USA will also get step.  At some point step enough that others force the government to stop using the rest of the USA&#x27;s economic clout to benefit the drug companies.<p>But I think it is very unlikely the other countries could sustain the losses long enough for the USA to cave.  It is a big if, but if China grows well economically for the next 20 years it is much more likely India and China together could work together on this to bring together a large coalition.<p>I don&#x27;t think China and India would work together as strong allies but they could come together in this area if the USA continues to demand large percentage of countries GDP be diverted to the USA drug companies.<p>All these types of things get complicated.  It isn&#x27;t as if the Drug companies don&#x27;t understand this same path.  They will obviously seek to use corruption in other countries as successfully as they have in the USA to get those governments to act in their interest for cash payments that are peanuts compared to the costs those governments will place on their citizens to benefit the drug companies.<p>The payments to corrupt political parties doesn&#x27;t only work in the USA, it works most everywhere.  So don&#x27;t count out the insane movement of wealth into drug companies coffers changing anytime soon.<p>If you want to be practical buying stock in these companies will likely reward you well.  That is what I have done.  I can understand if you think it is repugnant to profit from corruption in the political system on such a massive scale (very little corruption ever impacts multiple percentage points of GDP but, as this does).  That is likely a higher ethical decision, weighing my options I accept that &quot;hit&quot; to my karma.  If I were given the authority to decide the policy I would make a decision that would harm my stocks but I am not given that option.

It&#x27;s &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi and while it doesn&#x27;t particularly dwell on this part too much, it imagines a future where most people at some point decide to have their bodies stored indefinitely while their consciousness is connected to a Matrix-like virtual realm called &quot;Heaven&quot;.  Basically, instead of aging and death, once you get tired of regular life, you choose to go to Heaven.  Of course nobody can be sure they don&#x27;t just lop off parts of your body for cost cutting measures at some point but it&#x27;s irrelevant since the process is meant to be permanent.  Loved ones can patch in and visit you in &quot;Heaven&quot; but people tend to stop caring much about the rest of the world once they&#x27;re in a virtual world under their own control.",1444054990

There were seafood, beef, chicken, and three vegetarian options on the menu. However, you were restricted in your choice of three, and couldn&#x27;t do {Beef, Chicken, Seafood}, which basically meant you would be paying $20 for a pasta dish for two, because you also couldn&#x27;t pick {Beef, chicken, heartier non-meat option}. The total cost of ingredients was probably less than $15, maybe less than $10, for the pasta dish. It&#x27;s hard to justify that as a value proposition in my book. Overall, the quality of the ingredients wasn&#x27;t anything more special than what a local, non-budget, supermarket would carry in my market (NYC). (In fact, some of the labels on the ingredients seemed familiar from local delivery trucks in the area.) I agree with the GP: $10 a portion for a home cooked meal is expensive, <$5 is ideal. At $10 a portion, why make your own food, when you can get a gourmet healthy meal when you eat out?<p>When all was said and done, I felt that the best value proposition would be to just go on the Blue Apron website, look at the recipes, buy dry good ingredients in bulk, and make the recipes myself as time went on, buying the fresh ingredients as needed. As always, YMMV.<p>Edit: as many others have also pointed out, the packaging is &quot;neat&quot;, and probably necessary for their workflow, but it feels ever so wasteful.

It&#x27;s truly orders of magnitude more.<p>This huge increase in pilgrims over the last century is because of new technology like air travel, and the peace the world has experienced over the past few decades that allows people to move freely across the world. But it is due to the efforts of the Saudis to expand the masjid, build camps at Mina, allow hotels to be constructed, modernize the facilities, etc. that every person is able to actually perform the rites of hajj at the proper times. Hajj consists of a number of rites that have to be performed in certain places at certain times on certain days. Think about what it takes to organize millions of people trying to do this. It&#x27;s very different than organizing thousands, or tens of thousands. You have to accommodate all their sleeping arrangements. You have to provide enough space for marketplaces so they can get something to eat. You have to widen the roads, air condition the facilities, make sure each group leaves at their own time, etc.<p>It&#x27;s true that the Saudis aren&#x27;t perfect, and they make mistakes, but my point is that it&#x27;s easy to get the impression from the massive construction projects that they are just trying to make another Dubai or Olympics. But really, there is a spiritual purpose behind it, not connected to money, and there is also a lot going on behind the scenes that you can&#x27;t see in the pictures. It would be easier for the Saudis to just restrict the visas to a tiny fraction and not go through with all of the construction and organizing, but they are making the effort as you can see.

Undermining the basis of justice and democracy in secret negotiations without any feedback from the public is a terrible idea. If it was just about tariffs, sure, go ahead. But if business can get awarded massive damages in private courts because a democratic system decides not to tolerate their harmful practices anymore, well, that&#x27;s unbelievably harmful to any semblance of justice and democracy. Stuff like that should never be negotiated in secret, but be subject to democratic checks and balances. The status of ISDS is to me still the primary factor in whether this deal will be acceptable or not.

Negotiate reduction or elimination of tariffs in foreign markets so that domestic producers can expand abroad.<p>2. Protect their own domestic producers from foreign competition by retaining the import tariffs that keep them competitive.<p>So, Japan subsidizes its domestic rice farms and tarrifs rice imports, but wants to sell its cars unfettered. Brazil wants to export its oranges and other produce more, the US wishes to export more of it&#x27;s beef and cattle market. (These are the ones I&#x27;m thinking of off hand.)<p>The thinking goes however, that nations will gain more if they can all agree to open their tariffs, and allow goods to &quot;trade freely&quot;. This means that while there will be short term disruption and decline in some markets, that their economies will have net growth on the whole, because economics is not a zero-sum game. For the TPP, the math is somewhat easy: One or more domestic industries will face internal competition, while their export markets will now be open to a dozen new countries. If they all do this, it&#x27;s a net gain. (So the thinking goes.)<p>The portions that people seem to take issue with mostly in our line of interest have to do with the intellectual property provisions. This is to shore up the mismatch in legal protections that exist in countries with weaker IP laws. You can more or less sum this up with pointing out that pirated software and media is sold openly in countries like China and Vietnam. The provisions pertaining to those are other countries saying &quot;Look, we&#x27;ll trade, but only if you respect our IP.&quot;<p>Whether or not you agree with those provisions is of course, the million dollar question, and on things like that, the fate of the TPP depends. But that&#x27;s the rationale.<p>And yes, you&#x27;re exactly right, a rising global standard of living is /exactly/ what everyone wants. It&#x27;s not some evil conspiracy, it really is that. And so long as no one can game the system (too badly), that&#x27;s exactly what will happen.<p>(More reading on that last point.

In recent years as I added in NLP, SQL and web dev style programming skills to the mix I find myself building apps that in many ways automate analytical tasks.<p>With one product I developed for professional and trade associations I estimated that the average association would require as many as 10 full-time entry level analysts working with the typical Excel, Access and Powerpoint tools that so many of them use in order to even come close to replicating the personalized, graphical reporting that my platform could do for an association in real-time.<p>After feeling a bit guilty here is what I came to realize. The automation that I am offering lets the association offer a set of services to their members that previously would have never been considered because it was financially unthinkable. So if an association decides to use my platform they won&#x27;t typically eliminate jobs. Instead they will add really substantial capabilities with an external platform supported service and no additional headcount.<p>This is just my example, but I think that might be true in many cases that automation of analytics (data science) will mostly add capabilities to organizations and not take away many jobs.",1444053866

Other posters have pointed out the large amount of dirty diesel trucks (and trains). VW&#x27;s TDI engines have had some recent success. I own a 2012 Jetta TDI because I commute 56km each way for work, so the 5.8l/100km I get from it (80% highway 20% city driving) is handy, and it&#x27;s fun to drive.<p>I understand in the US diesel is always more expensive than gas. Here that is only the case in the winter. In the summer it is 5-10cents a litre cheaper than gasoline. In the winter it&#x27;s about 5-10cents a litre more expensive, the reason I have been told is the demand for diesel oil increases due to furnace oil consumption, which is basically diesel oil.<p>There are quite a few TDIs on the road where I am, but I live rural so there are a lot of highway drivers. They don&#x27;t make much sense as an urban car, for stop and go traffic the fuel economy isn&#x27;t good at all.",1444053634

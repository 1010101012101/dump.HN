4212255,comment,4211974,4212222,2,0,travisp,,,"Yes, I learned this from a talk at the University of Chicago Hospitals -- Medicare/Medicaid almost always paid less than a  dollar for every dollar in costs that they incurred (I think the quoted average number was closer to 50 cents on the dollar but I could be wrong). The only way they made up for these costs was from patients with certain types of private health insurance (not all types because some like Blue Cross had essentially negotiated rates very very close to cost). Without these patients, the hospital would not have been able to afford the Medicare and Medicaid patients.",1341683905

The ""number of users"" metric, for example, is not clearly defined.  Does it mean total number of warm bodies who signed up?  That's hard to fake.  Is it the number of rows in your user table?  That's easy.  If people can register multiple accounts, then 1000 people could have 10,000 accounts and claim 10,000 unique ""users"".<p>It is also easy to get users by having a free tier.  You could have 100,000 free users and 10 paid, and claim to have ""100,000 customers"".  Or if your service is targeted at businesses, who then resell to their customers (an MLS service for example), then you might claim that your service is ""used by 100,000 customers"" even though you only sold to 100 businesses.<p>You also have to read the wording carefully.

4212244,comment,4211479,4212174,6,0,flatline3,,,"> <i>This, actually, is one of my favorite points. Letting the JVM grab a giant allocation at startup is fine if all you're going to do with your machine is run JVM programs (i.e. a server), but it sucks when you've got multiple apps all trying to play nice together. The OS has a memory management system for a reason. I'd much prefer my runtime use the existing system, than re-invent the wheel (as it were).</i><p>The OS memory management system is as general-purpose as possible. At the kernel/process interaction level, the APIs are thin abstractions on the underlying VM page mapping system. Below that, at the malloc level, malloc is designed to be as general purpose allocator as possible, without introducing complexity unsupportable in C, such as migrating allocations across generations.<p>The JVM's lack of ability to rededicate pages to the OS is a failing of Sun's particular implementation, and is not strictly inherent in the design of generational collectors.<p>Your argument dismantles Sun's architectural choice when used on mobile hardware, but does not address the relative merits of alternative allocation/collection schemes.<p>> In regards to the class registration system: <i>""It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away""</i><p>That response has little substance. It's not perfect, or even great, it's merely functional. I would be enthralled if Mach-O two-level namespacing worked with ObjC classes, but it can not.<p>> <i>The type encodings are simple C strings!</i><p>They're C strings, not particularly simple. Try decoding (with lackluster documentation) a complex structure return value. Modern runtimes use much more cleanly structured, cross-referenced data here.<p>> <i>If by that you mean that the central message dispatch routine is hand-optimized assembly for each platform the runtime is available on... I'll have some more of that, please!</i><p>No, that's not what I mean. You'd find just as much complex hand-optimized assembly code in other runtimes, likely more.<p>I'm referring to design choices such as the use of unnecessarily complex data structures with minimal if not outright missing API to access them, poorly abstracted implementation details (such as exposing C string type signatures as the highest-level representation of a type encoding), minimal/missing/poorly-defined metadata.<p>An example is the failure to encode type data in blockrefs in the first public release of blocks for ObjC, which made it impossible to implement imp_implementationWithBlock(), due to the need to differentiation between stret vs non-stret return types and select the appropriate trampoline. This required changes to both the compiler and the runtime, and meant that prior to those changes' introduction by Apple, it would have been impossible for an external entity to implement similar functionality.<p>This sort of hackish minimalism is the polar opposite of the careful considered and long-term focused design that Microsoft (and even Sun) applied to the core of their platform. Compare the completeness (and longevity) of the JVM Virtual Machine specification to the ObjC runtime. Over roughly the same amount of time, Apple has had to introduce complete ABI-breaking fundamental changes of to their runtime to implement extremely basic language enhancements. In contract, the JVM specification has not, to my recollection, been broken once over the course of 20 years. Additions have always been forward-compatible.<p>An example of the above would be the addition of non-fragile base classes through the use of minimal ivar access indirection. This required a wholesale breakage of the entire language, and thus could only be introduced on 64-bit Mac OS X and on iOS.<p>Apple's language and runtime design is hackish at best.",1341683760

4212228,comment,4211479,4212202,3,0,caladri,,,"Can you expand on ""shows its age""?  Code entropy doesn't increase as a function of time alone.  An ANSI C ""Hello, World!"" from 1990 doesn't show its age in the context of C today, for example.<p>Is age an issue in its own right, or is it what informs what you perceive as a poor implementation that precludes the implementation of ""modern"" features?  Also, I wonder if you perceive any possibility that progress might actually occur in the form not of accumulating more features on top of the modern fashionable designs but of starting from an earlier base and pursuing an alternate path of evolution to that of extant runtimes  do you?<p>For example, is it possible that there is some innovation which could occur on top of C which would not be possible in the context of some modern language and its modern runtime which would make it a more desirable platform than the modern alternatives?  As someone who works primarily in C (and is a little tickled by commentary elsewhere on this item about C programmers in the '80s and '90s that suggests everyone moved ""up"" from C to C++; very Microsoft!) I would say that's certainly the case, because there are already things that make C more appealing than C#, Java, etc.  An extension to the type system to do optional, minimalistic reference counting rather than having to use GC in a modern language or the STL's reference-counted containers (or something home-grown) in C++ would be a huge step forward for example.  The locking annotations available with Clang and GCC have removed much of the value-add for using a language which does more hand-holding around synchronization.<p>If it isn't that age precludes the possibility of progress, then what's the problem with age?

4212227,comment,4211602,4212005,4,0,_delirium,,,"Interestingly, the distinction was actually common among the founding generation of Americans, before even Proudhon, though Proudhon turned it into more of a fully worked out theory of property.<p>Benjamin Franklin, for example, wrote this:<p><i>""All the property that is necessary to a man for the conservation of the individual and the propagation of the species is his natural right, which none can justly deprive him of; but all property superfluous to such purposes is the property of the public, who by their laws have created it, and who may therefore by other laws dispose of it whenever the welfare of the public shall demand such a disposition.""</i><p>(Elsewhere he clarifies that what he means by ""necessary to a man"" is essentially personal possessions, work tools, and shelter.)<p>Thomas Jefferson made a similar distinction in some of his letters. There's some speculation that Jefferson+Franklin's view that property isn't a natural right, but a social convention, is why the Declaration of Independence discusses ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"", rather than the formulation, ""life, liberty, and property"" that was otherwise more common at the time.",1341683359

4212219,comment,4211479,4211479,20,0,SeoxyS,,,"Objective-C is hands down one of my favorite programming language:<p>- It's compiled, not interpreted. Even Java and C# are compiled into bytecode for a massive VM to interpret. Objective-C has no VM, it's pure binary + a shared library to implement the runtime. It also uses the very best compiler, clang, which gives incredibly helpful error messages, warnings and suggestions.<p>- It's a strict superset of C. Even C++ does not meet this criteria. This means any valid C is valid Obj-C and behaves exactly the same way, in any Obj-C file. You can drop down levels of abstraction for performance, and can even write assembly if that's what it takes.<p>- It has an amazing and fully supported debugger in the form of LLDB.<p>- It's fully dynamic, allows introspection, duck typing and even monkey patching (with a little effort; method swizzling). Everything is an object, except for native C types.<p>- It takes the right approach to memory management. Realizes that garbage collectors are abominations, and that managing memory is really the job of either the developer or the compiler.<p>- It has the most fantastic concurrency framework I've ever used, in the form of `libdispatch`. Now, to be fair, it's a C library that ought to work anywhere, but practically it only works well on Apple's platforms and using clang.<p>- Apple is moving in the right direction, cleaning up the language, removing annoyances and making syntax more succinct.<p>- Header files. I think I'm on my own in liking thisbut I think headers are amazing. They're a succinct and standalone version of a documentation file that is extremely useful to both developers and the compiler. Use them to describe well the public interface to your class, and you don't even really have to write documentation anymore.<p>- Solid design patterns and convention-driven. These are getting better by the day, with the recent addition of closures to the language.<p>There's two major annoyances:<p>- It's often needlessly verbose. Not in the syntax, mind you, which is just fine, but in the naming conventions. For example, `NSArray` has a method called `enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:` instead of simply `each:`. Add that up to every single name, and you get pretty ugly codeand good luck writing it with anything other than Xcode's context-aware autocompletion.<p>- It's tied to Apple's platforms, and well not run on anything else. Now, I'm fine with Apple-specific frameworks and GUI frameworks (like QuickTime or UIKit) being Apple-only, but I'd really love to use the language to write a backend service, for which I'd only need Foundation & libdispatch, for example.",1341683045

Old objects tend to stick around, so reference counting overhead is low. By using a hybrid of both techniques where they are strong, you avoid a lot of overhead: pointless ref-count changing, and pointless scanning of object graphs. The result is something with the high throughput of generational GC with only a fraction of the maximum pause time.<p><a href=""https://researchers.anu.edu.au/publications/29505"" rel=""nofollow"">https://researchers.anu.edu.au/publications/29505</a><p><a href=""http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~erez/Papers/ao-cc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~erez/Papers/ao-cc.pdf</a>",1341682670

Most things produced are valuable.<p>Sure, but my point was that, at its basic, value can be thought of as the following function:<p><pre><code>    Val(demand, supply) = const * demand / supply.\n</code></pre>\nOnly the second parameter (supply) is a function of labor (the higher the labor cost, the more difficult it is to produce a large quantity of something) and a few other things (for example, availability of materials necessary for production, availability of process, etc). So value is only a partial function of labor. This is both good and bad, the good part being is that it is possible to generate large amount of value with relatively little labor.<p>Another point is that by ""labor"" we usually mean either physical labor or time spent, not mental effort exerted. If we add the mental effort exerted (multiplied by intelligence of the knowledge worker) to the definition of value, we will see a closer relationship between labor and value.<p>Something you spend a lot of time working on may have a lot of value to <i>you</i> (as in: it aided development of your skills, for example), but it doesn't mean that it will have a lot of value to everyone else. We ought not to mistake what we value with what an average individual from a large group of people values.<p>This has an important consequence. If you're smart, you ought to position yourself where you can have a lot of leverage. That would be somewhere away from being a labor provider and closer to being one who makes decisions on the basis of demand and supply. Also, you can have a lot of leverage if you're willing to incur risk. Labor providers usually don't incur a lot of risk (in worst case, they get nothing). In entrepreneurship, on the other hand, risk can mean losing a lot of money. By moving towards making demand/supply decisions and by willing to incur risk, you can generate not only more value for yourself, but more overall value, since in voluntary transactions both sides benefit.",1341681834

The indigenous people and cultures were so badly wiped out by a variety of factors (some with European fault, some without) as to leave a sense of an untamed wilderness (actually, there were probably advanced agrarian societies over every inch of the US at one time) and an abundance of land. I think much of the appeal of zombie/apocalyptic fiction in the US comes from a longing for a future (like our semi-imaginary past) of open land.<p>When land was (or seemed) effectively free, the ""obviously virtuous"", positive-sum thing to do was to find unused land and bring it into productivity-- rather than to squabble for allocation of an existing resource as people did in the cities. Hence the association of the rural frontier with positive-sum virtue and urbanity (and Europe, at that time) with zero-sum congestion. So more specifically, it was a rural style of land ownership (in ""new"" land) that was associated with virtue.<p>Of course, the frontier closed, and over time we became urban (suburbia is extremely-low-density and often dismal urbanity) like everyone else.<p>Land doesn't matter as much as it did, except in major cities. A landed gentry has been replaced by an educated (sometimes in name only) and connected one, and urban land is only worth so much on account of the people it is (implicitly through locality) connected to. That's why Manhattan and Silicon Valley real estate are so ungodly expensive: because ambitious, smart people move there, so they're good places to set up a business and tap local talent. <i>We</i> are the reason for the <i>value</i> that justifies the <i>price</i>, and for thanks, we get royally fucked-over by the landlords for it.<p>I have no issue with small-time landowners and the notion of owning one's own home, and any land reform policy that I'd support would have to have an exemption (around $500,000 seems reasonable) under which it doesn't apply. However, I definitely don't think the association of land ownership with virtuous stewardship applies to large-scale urban housing ownership. It's classic medieval rent-seeking, nothing more.",1341680790

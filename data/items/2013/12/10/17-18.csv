Hi Fructose corn syrup is basically vegetarian. As are Pringles and coke. Doritos and guacamole. Don&#x27;t forget Beer and Margarits! Snickers really satisfies your vegetarian cravings too. Nuttella tastes great but is mostly hot choclate made with palm-oil rather than milk, which makes is closer to a vegan health-food, but there are traces of powdered milk in it. Pop-tarts are a great vegetarian breakfast, too at 400 calories per pack. Not to mention the greatest caloric density in snack foods, the humble almond at 180 cal/oz.

6882302,comment,6881500,6881892,3,0,secstate,,,"Oh man ... flame war alert.<p>The reality of course, is more nuanced. Rarely do absolutist statements like &quot;Killing animals is wrong,&quot; bare fruit in the pragmatic reality of everyday experience.<p>For one thing, freeing all livestock and allowing them to live as nature intended, would be releasing them into a much more savage existence. An analog to freeing slaves does not exist because people have the capacity to improve their station, while animals in the wild fall back to basic survival.<p>My wife and I run a backyard hog farm, raising animals on pasture with ready access to clean water and plenty of highly nutritious food. In return for the kindness we show them, at a pre-determined point in their life, we kill them and eat their meat.<p>I will not do that for my children, because the (mostly) tacit contract I have with them and their own capacity allows them pay back my kindness and generosity with their nuanced human emotion and industrial capacity.<p>Most animals do not have such an industrial capacity. Though where they do (horses, mules, etc...) there actually does exist a very different contract (i.e. we don&#x27;t eat them).<p>The problem with your black and white view of morality is that it fails to account for the reality that if I keep 15 hogs, eventually they will die, because all life dies. If they live into old age and become emaciated and weak, their bodies are useless to me. Aside from perhaps companionship, they have not had a net positive impact on my life. Why then should I care for them?<p>As members of the Animal Liberation Front have discovered, releasing animals back into the wild is rarely a kindness to them. If you ever look closely at a wild rabbit, you find them swarming with parasites and usually living with chronic low-grade infection of some sort or another. Compare that with rabbits raised humanely and holistically in a small-scale rabbit farm and the differences are stark, indeed.<p>None of this applies, of course, to an industrial farm where animals are treated, as a phase of the end product instead of animal. But that&#x27;s a whole different argument from &quot;killing animals is wrong.&quot; I have no problem arguing that industrial farming is, at it&#x27;s best, amoral, and more importantly completely unsustainable. But nature has a way of handling unsustainable behavior.<p>EDIT: Dairy animals would be another classification of animals that we do not kill for their meat. Of course, they do die, as one of our dairy goats did a few days ago. But then we dig a hole, say some kind words and let the decomposition feed the apple trees in our orchard.",1386698216

Perhaps a different approach would be more effective in changing people&#x27;s opinions.<p>The argument against campers: &quot;Starbucks and other coffee-shop campers just buy one cheap coffee and then take up a table for hours. We drive up the cost of coffee and inconvenience everybody else. We play loud videos and run our power cords across the floor, creating a safety hazard.&quot;<p>His argument for campers (in my own words): I&#x27;m an intellectual/creative person; I need to work in a coffee shop because research has shown it to increase creativity and output; I need to resist the brainwashed masses and their preconceived notions of acceptable coffee shop behavior.<p>Notice a theme?

It&#x27;s meaningless.<p>Unlike most animals (as far as we know) we are in the unique position of being moral creatures. We created this morality idea, which was not present in nature before us.<p>Killing any kind of sentient creature whose death could have been avoided is immoral (whether legal or not). That some countries still apply the barbarous death penalty doesn&#x27;t make it less immoral. We don&#x27;t know exactly the level of sentience of the animals we kill and eat, but they are at the very least self-conscious to some extent. Pigs, squids, dolphins, dogs, cats, etc, are all clearly human-like in some ways. Killing such animals is not that far off from killing sentient beings.<p>I think it&#x27;s a fair statement to say that killing animals is <i>wrong</i>.<p>That being said...<p>The issue is complex. There is a lot of historical baggage that we have to deal with here. And it could be argued that many of those species only exist because we eat them (or at least that most of their numbers exist only because we eat them). Endless such arguments can be contrived.

6882257,comment,6880944,6881780,5,0,bad_user,,,"First of all, it&#x27;s hard to tell how much memory a process uses. If you&#x27;re on Linux or on OS X and you&#x27;re using &quot;top&quot;, there&#x27;s difficulty in interpreting the results.<p>For example right now my Firefox 26 with about 20 tabs is being reported by &quot;top&quot; as using 2190MB VIRT and ~1030MB RES. VIRT reports the total amount of memory allocated, including memory that&#x27;s shared between processes, including memory-mapped files, including virtual memory, including the loaded shared libraries, or anything that takes up address space, but address space is not real, the measure is next to useless. RES is the relevant measure, which in my case reports about 1 GB, however that&#x27;s a little misleading too because it also counts memory that&#x27;s shared between processes, although in my case I think 1 GB is an accurate measure. And if you&#x27;re using some kind of GUI that doesn&#x27;t specify exactly how it calculates memory consumption, then you can&#x27;t trust what it says.<p>Second, free memory is unused memory. Browsers are caching stuff for example. Unused caches in memory-strained systems end up being flushed to disk. The kernel is quite efficient in flushing memory pages on disk and reloading them later when needed. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s very hard to tell how much memory a process needs to be usable.<p>If you want to claim that some application leaks memory, then you need to look at <i>growth</i>. And if you want to claim that it&#x27;s a memory hog, then you need to take a look at how it behaves on top of memory constrained systems.<p>In my experience, Firefox is very memory efficient, which is why I&#x27;m using it and not Chrome. And I&#x27;m on the beta channel now, so I&#x27;ve been on Firefox 26 since a week ago and it&#x27;s OK.",1386697848

You can refactor all your synchronized {...} blocks and replace them with executor.execute(futuretask); futuretask.get();, where executor is a single-threaded event loop and futuretask.get() blocks for the operation to complete. This refactoring would make a single thread the owner of the state, but there would be exactly the same number of deadlocks. Conceptually, you can think of your critical sections as a separate thread on which you invoke methods and then block until completion.<p>After refactoring to use Executor and BlockingQueue, one still has to make sure there are no cycles in which threads are allowed to block waiting for which other threads.",1386697659

Again, morality as popularly conceived has nothing to do with it. It has more to do with the propensity of kings to end up with their heads chopped off. It always boils down to the sword.

I feel like I touched on this in my original response, but I still don&#x27;t see how the underrepresentation equates to being driven away.  &quot;Driving away&quot; implies some level of hostility, which you claim only to mean &quot;societal disadvantages.&quot;  It seems in attempt to sensationalize, you end up confusing the issue because by talking about two disparate things as if they were the same.<p>I&#x27;m actually <i>very</i> surprised how accepting this community is.  Not only am I black, but I came from a military background with no tech working experience, just hobby experience.  Additionally, I spent two years between Iraq and Afghanistan on small teams, something this audience isn&#x27;t exactly keen on.  If there was anyone who would face &quot;hostility&quot; or be &quot;driven away&quot; it&#x27;d be me.  I&#x27;m amazed at how welcoming the community has been.  I remember after going to my first conference I told my wife (also a Marine) that I finally felt like I belonged somewhere.  By the way, my wife came to the same conference with me and loved it as well.  She&#x27;s still a Marine, flies F/A-18&#x27;s, and talked with the guys at dinner about the future of aviation, drones, etc.  She thought the community was awesome despite barely being able to use her smartphone.<p>Sure the community may be overly critical at times, but sometimes that&#x27;s the price you pay for being around bright people who value intellect.  I see it as something that makes me better.  Additionally, it&#x27;d be hard to find a community with bigger hearts and a greater ability (resources and skills) to make things and make things happen.<p>No matter who you are, if you do good work you&#x27;ll fit in with this community in my experience.<p>P.S. By the way, I do appreciate your thoughts and I think your heart is in the right place. I just think there are more effective ways to discuss the issue. Labeling under representation as hostility seems more likely to drive a wedge between sides than improve the situation.<p>How did any of us get into tech?

You can try to minimize this (e.g. by maximizing GPU density in a single server, for example you can apparently get 16 GPUs in a blade server format) but it&#x27;s definitely always a significant factor. My guess is that NVIDIA sees this problem and will move away from the co-processor model and move towards a System-on-a-Chip design with GPU, ARM CPU, NIC and unified memory in a single package. If Parallella saw large usage in the areas you mention (endpoint devices in control systems, sensor arrays, etc) then the competition could be good for the market and force NVIDIA&#x27;s hand.

No seriously, what a stupid paragraph to read through.<p>> Reading through HN&#x27;s headlines it is hard not to notice that most discussion is generated around countless &quot;threats&quot;.<p>Why did you put quotes around threats? You seem to imply that the NSA, piracy, patent trolls, banks, other countries&#x27; governments [and how they integrate with ours], and big corporations do not warrant our awareness. In fact, you don&#x27;t even believe they are threats apparently by your continued use of quotation marks.<p>>  A hacker is supposedly someone who is enlightened about the power of their own creativity. If you are focused on creating something, none of these &quot;threats&quot; would matter.<p>Where did you discover the following rules?\n(a) a hacker is an enlightened creator\n(b) when focused on creative pursuits, threats do not matter<p>Could you prove them for me? If not, then why do you use them as reasonable premises for your concluding argument?\nIn fact, you might have an easier time arguing that a creator is more highly aware of threat because they don&#x27;t want to see everything they worked for go to waste. Programmers naturally become skeptics; not because they want to get down on people but because they immediately look for the holes in the logic. Because, um, it&#x27;s our job!! Are you surprised when you meet a compassionate nurse? How about a sly politician? No? Then maybe you&#x27;re starting to get it. The lens we see through the world through is different than the nurses&#x27;s, and so we have our own stance on say, the NSA, or Obama&#x27;s re-election, or congress shutting down, or any other human event that takes place. It makes sense that we would use this community to talk about that outlook amongst other fellow craftsmen who have the same kinda lens.<p>Some, not all, care what&#x27;s happening around us. We&#x27;re not this fantastical creative hacker secluded from society. The idea that we are, coupled with the idea that we shouldn&#x27;t be concerned with threats, is insulting. It puts us in a box and gives rise to the &quot;us vs them&quot; attitude. Whether you idolize us or demonize us, you miss the underlying fact that we&#x27;re humans too.<p>>So what&#x27;s the reason for attributing so much power to these external &quot;forces&quot;, none of which have ANY intrinsic power beyond what you give them?<p>Now for the grand-daddy of stupidity. Apparently the NSA and any other big world power is just an external force that doesn&#x27;t have any intrinsic power besides what we give it! I forgot!<p>You&#x27;re not stupid enough to believe this, I know this. You&#x27;re just saying it to give greater power to your already weak argument that hackers are insecure. This is a very intelligent, progressive, and open-minded community. We regularly debate things in a way congress wishes it did. You have the audacity to put us in a box, call us insecure, stamp a cute label &quot;enlightened hacker&quot;, and question why we should ever be concerned about politics. Get the hell out of here with that nonsense. I&#x27;ll say it again: we&#x27;re humans too.

Yes, they present it completely biased and it&#x27;s clear what the motivations of the publisher here are, but I think it&#x27;s important to finally get visibility on what meat consumption actually means.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to see that people who want to eat meat are okay with the fact that we&#x27;re so detached from what it actually is.

In my opinion if you&#x27;re going to do that you would want to engineer the most robust society possible.<p>Ultimately the best way to have a robust society is for everyone to be 100% self-sufficient.  It&#x27;s like process isolation; if there are problems with one process it doesn&#x27;t bleed over into other ones.  That&#x27;s not terribly efficient from an economic perspective.  But as far as robustness goes it&#x27;s excellent.<p>Specialization in society is more efficient at the expense of robustness.  If you&#x27;re a wine-maker and people suddenly develop a taste for beer you&#x27;re SOL until you re-train as a brewer.  That&#x27;s a non-trivial process.  But so long as wine remains in demand it&#x27;s far more efficient for there to be only a few thousand (or 10&#x27;s of thousands or whatever) wineries than 100 million or more.  And the wine produced will likely be of higher quality.<p>Many of the questions we&#x27;re dealing with today are where exactly to strike the balance between robustness and efficiency.  During a boom everyone is gung-ho about specialization, as the downturn sets in people are more focused on self-reliance.<p>Ultimately like you said there&#x27;s truth to both sides otherwise society would have shifted entirely one way or the other.<p>Personally I&#x27;d like to see a more robust society as that means that downturns hurt the country as a whole less, and those individuals that are hurt are also hurt less.  Yes it&#x27;s at the expense of growth but as we&#x27;ve seen in the housing and higher ed markets, growth isn&#x27;t a panacea.",1386694915

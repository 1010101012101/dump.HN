1446036,comment,1445519,1445998,0,0,carbocation,,,"The cause of the constellation of symptoms that we associate with aging remains outstanding. Perhaps it is environmental; perhaps it is genetic. Certainly, one cannot expect us to treat the root cause of that which we don't even have more than a rudimentary understanding. Gaining that understanding will (hopefully) be one of the defining achievements of the 21st century -- most likely too late for you and me, but of tremendous import for those to come later.<p>If we had advanced nanotechnology that could do whatever you asked to ameliorate the root cause of aging, what would you ask it to do? I submit that we don't know yet, so trying to choose the right technology for the job (such as nano) at this point is a bit like putting the cart several feet in front of the horse.<p>The above notwithstanding, I honestly fail to see how making people live longer would save any money. Presumably it would just delay the inevitable, expensive end-of-life care by a few (or many) years. Do you not see it that way? I would love to have a more optimistic view.",1277017014
1446035,comment,1445969,1445969,0,0,wooster,,,"A subscription to the New York Times costs $769.60 per year. A good chunk of that is printing and delivery costs for something I don't want anyway: a giant stack of physical paper. On top of the odd environmental disconnect of shipping a whole tree's worth of paper to each individual customer in tiny chunks every day over a year, there's the disconnect of customers paying to have advertising delivered to them.<p>How they expect people to pay for that in a world where I can read their best articles online for free is totally beyond me.<p>What I would like to see is:<p>- An iPad version of the full paper (not just the selections they have now).<p>- No advertising.<p>- A price reflective of the reduced printing and delivery costs. I don't want to subsidize the physical paper subscriptions of other people.<p>- Fast search and access to the archives from within the iPad app.<p>Then again, as long as the web site remains free (although hobbled by advertising and splitting articles across pages), I doubt the iPad app would get much traction. You never know though.<p>Also, with all that said, I don't live in New York. For my local paper (the San Francisco Chronicle) to warrant me subscribing, they'd need to start doing some real journalism. For example, they could look at the city and state government. In a budget crisis, you'd think there would be plenty of material to use. The milquetoast reporting they currently practice isn't worth any of my money.",1277017010
1446034,story,,,134,167,datawalke,"Ask HN: Typical Startup or Abuse?",,"Over the past year I have been working for a local startup, in the United States, as the Jack-of-all-trades. We offer a product specialized to a fairly niche industry that is doing fairly well. In the past year we haven gone from 2 to 75 clients, gaining around 3 clients per week in the past two months. The product typically nets $5,000/yr per client. The product itself is web-based running off of an opensource CMS.<p>For the first 10 months I was the only person in the office doing work ~9 hours a day. From client setup, to design, to code and deployment I did it all. Twice a week I would be joined by the other 3 part-time guys who would do what they could in their 4 hours they had. Besides myself and the other team members the founder would do sales two to three days a week part time. Now a year in we have eight full time team members (5 Dev, 1 Sales, 1 CS). My role in the company has now taken on the Jack-Of-All-Trades plus the management of these other team members. Which I consider to be a great accomplishment for myself and I am proud of. However one factor in all of this has not changed in the past twelve months: compensation.<p>I was never a fussy person about money, especially when it came to startups. (I was in two other startups prior to this one.) I understand that you must bootstrap and try to be as frugal and agile as possible in the start. However a year in, and I am still making around $500/week. Which, in the beginning was great. However over the past year I have moved out, bought a car (out of need, the other died), gotten married, and have had a child. (With a second one on the way.) The other two major factors are: no benefits, and the founder seems to refuse to officially employ me (or anyone else in the company.). He still gives all of us a 1099. Yet, he treats us like employees. We have required working times, usually 8AM - 6PM, we only get a half hour lunch with no other breaks, and are on-call 24-7. Honestly, those items don't even bother me <i>that</i> much. However what does is that if I am one minute late from my 30 minute lunch, the founder will immediately call me asking where I am. If I happen to arrive at work a minute or two late I get a lecture. If I don't answer a call, on a weekend, I get a talk about availability. And if I am sick, I am required to work from home for the day. (I was in the hospital and still required to work.) That is what really gets me upset about this situation. I am fairly sure what he is doing is illegal with the 1099 issue. But it really upsets me that for all of the work and dedication that I have put in, that I can't get cut a break once or twice.<p>I am unsure how many of you are in a similar situation or even care. I honestly am not looking for any sympathy on this however I am seeking advice. Two weeks ago a new-hire and I went out for lunch and he asked me about the 1099 situation and asked what he should do. I told him to take some of the money out of his check to save for taxes. He said something to the degree of ""But I only make $500/week!"". I am not exactly sure why that made me lose my cool. Ever since then I have felt that the founder has not only been using me, but also the rest of the team. And I am letting this issue get to me. I spend each day now hating what I am doing because I have this feeling. I know the easiest answer may be: Well why not just talk to the founder? And I have.<p>The response is always the same: ""We can't do that right now.""(Benefits/Employ) ""Remember I haven't even paid myself yet for any of this!""(Compensation) ""It's cheaper for <i>you</i> if we do it this way!"" (1099) And he won't budge.<p>I have been doing web work since I was nine. This is my passion in life. I spend all the time I can perfecting my craft and trying the best I can to stay current. I've never cared about money in the past, but the time has come where I have to. I hate myself for letting this job get to me to the point where it makes me burnt out on my passion.<p>This leaves me in the position of asking myself what to do now. My gut, and my wife, is telling me to begin looking for other jobs. Any advice?

I realize this article is aimed at getting the best hired gun you can, but the best way to partner with a developer is to do just that - actually partner, not toss requirements over a wall.

Then let them run with it.<p>You could combine this approach with the whole ""hire 3 people and see who can turn in the best result"" idea.

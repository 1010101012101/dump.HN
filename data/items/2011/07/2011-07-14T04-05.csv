2761808,comment,2759648,2760157,2,0,emelski,,,"> For some people, 250GB/month is unreasonable.<p>If 250GB/month is unreasonable, then those people should not be signing up for a 250GB/month service plan.  There's nothing stopping him from getting a business plan, for example, with a larger cap or no cap at all.  It's not reasonable for this user to expect to dictate both the bandwidth limits _and_ the low price point.  Even if we stipulate that internet access is a human right, I don't think it's reasonable to assert that everybody is entitled to unlimited bandwidth to the internet, at somebody else's expense.<p>> How do my internet habits interfere with your internet habits?<p>As far as I know, at some point this guy's connection is going through a shared resource, whether that is a switch or router or hub or whatever.  Those gadgets only have so much bandwidth available, which is shared amongst all the connections going through it.  Sure, most of the time the limit of that hardware vastly exceeds the demands of those connections, but there _is_ a limit, and it is possible (albeit, perhaps, unlikely) that one guy, uploading _terabytes_ of data, could impede his neighbor's ability to enjoy the internet.",1310619494

2761795,comment,2760540,2761606,3,0,redthrowaway,,,"I think you're reading my argument as something it's not.  I'm not saying that the current model is in any way bucking market forces, quite the opposite.  I'm saying that the current model of entrepreneurship seems to be focussed more on a quick ROI/liquidity event rather than innovation or business-building.  That in itself is not bad.  My complaint, which I think the author is hinting at as well, is that this model of startup is far more ""credit swap"" than ""mom and pop"".  It is, as she said, a commoditization of entrepreneurship.<p>YC, while invaluable for founders, is also an investment vessel factory, and the economic model it embodies shares much more in common with the kinds of financial products we see from Wall Street than traditional venture capitalism.  Yuri Milner's offer of $100k to each YC graduate embodies this.  It's a scattergun approach that, while likely profitable, incentivizes flipping over innovating.",1310619077
2761794,comment,2760989,2760989,3,0,tylerneylon,,,"Why are creative Lego sets a minority?<p>I think you can draw an analogy with wikipedia.  Most people just read, and don't contribute.  But what makes wikipedia what it is, is the ability of others to put their ideas into it.  So we have the _potential_ to create and customize, and a minority of people taking full advantage of that, but the end result is interesting to many more people than contributors.  Similarly, I'm guessing most Lego sets are bought _because_ of the appeal of Lego's pre-baked designs -- along with the potential to customize.  Users want more power and potential than they actually use, and some power users make the community more involved, and aware of the potential.<p>Or at least that's my guess as to Lego marketing's thoughts.  As a kid, I definitely preferred to make my own things.  I'd be curious to know if that's the standard use case for most kids today or not (making their own vs just following the instructions).",1310619033

But I was more productive than him. I got my stuff done and left, whereas he needed much longer for his tasks.<p>This caused a lot of frustration for me and him, as we both felt we were treated unfairly. I thought a lot about our problem and came to the following conclusion: This was a trust issue, as most things are. He simply did not trust me to complete my tasks on time and wanted to monitor my progress almost to the point of obsession.<p>I told him that trust was the foundation of our relationship, and that if he couldn't trust me enough to complete my tasks on time, I would not continue working with him.<p>In my opinion, stress between colleagues about getting work done should never be an issue in a healthy company. People need to be able to trust each other that they work in the interest of the company. Before a lazy employee can affect the whole team, the employer should have handled the situation.",1310618877

The per-record IV in TLS 1.1 and later,  the overhead of the tls-cbc.txt workaround for earlier versions, and/or the extra block(s) of encryption required for HMAC-SHA-2-based cipher suites are bigger performance issues.<p>RC4 is faster than AES on older processors. On the current generation of Intel server processors, AES is faster because of AES-NI.<p>AES-GCM cipher suites should be even faster yet on those processors, but they are not widely implemented. Also, I wouldn't be surprised to see more interesting papers being published about weaknesses in the GMAC function in the near future. (Note: I don't have any knowledge of upcoming papers; I am guessing there will be some based on the recent paper regarding the discovery of unexpected weak keys in GMAC.)

What Alexander Graham Bell worked on meant that humans could talk to each other over large distances for the first time ever. What the early PC/Mac pioneers worked on meant that huge computing power was put in the hands of the average person for the first time ever. These were history changers<p>I think many would agree that working on a project similar to one of the above is on a <i>very</i> different level, and much more satisfying, than working in a startup that is producing yet another photo sharing app.<p>What the author of the article may be lamenting is that so many bright minds are being ""wasted"" on yet another Groupon clone where no technical breakthroughs are being made, and not on useful projects where technical breakthroughs are needed, like renewable energy, natural language processing, etc. Whoever solves these problems will enable something that was not possible before and have an impact on the course of humanity.<p>2) On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with wanting to make money, and wanting to make it in the most easy way possible. If so many other professions can make a lot of money without really benefiting humanity, why shouldn't engineers feel free to exploit the recent gold rush in their field and make as much money as possible, with little regard to how useful their product is to the world at large?",1310618659

Root cause was the person who installed my OS set the root password to ""g0grid"".  Bulletproof.<p>----------------------<p>This exact same thing happened to me!  I have a crappy little single box with them and I have been reasonably happy with their service (I was originally with servepath before they got bought by GoGrid).  I requested a 64-bit upgrade, which they did promptly.  I was contacted by customer service to tell me the upgrade was complete and to tell me how to log in, but I had already gone to bed.  The customer service rep left a VM message saying ""check your customer portal account for instructions on how to log in.""  The next morning before I leave for work, I'm just about to log in to my fresh box when I get a call from GoGrid saying my server has been compromised, offering to let me pay for a fresh install, or I can lock it down myself immediately.  I'm no security expert, but I damn well wasn't going to pay for a reinstall on a box I never logged in to.  I finally managed to get them to do the reinstall for free because they had to admit the password that the customer service rep had picked after the reinstall wasn't so hot: ""g0grid"".

I'm just building on to the previous commenter's points about the creation of new Silicon Valley in-crowd communities. Now, I think this whole point is debatable- certainly incubated or otherwise guided (like YC alumni) startups are a minority of startups. And unoriginal, make-a-quick-buck startups can come from anywhere. I just think that maybe there is a point to be made that the road of startups is getting more and more structured and unofficially regimented, whether it is through an incubator, or just by a culture that promotes certain patterns to success. And with the guidance of groups such as YC or incubators, it's made more and more easy.

I think their rates went up over 20% last year.  Although they are not a tech start up; rather, medical, and already established for some years.<p>My real concern is that people in the U.S. are, these days, paying ""life"" rates for what is essentially ""term"" insurance.  Take an all too typical contemporary example.  Someone has held one or several jobs that included health care insurance from the time they graduated, say two decades ago.  During that time, they may well have paid significantly more in insurance premiums than they received in care -- as a statistical average, their demographic certainly did.  (I don't care whether they employer paid some or all of the premiums; call it an indirect wage, if you will.)<p>Now entering the latter half of their forties, and at higher risk, they are sh-tcanned by their (latest) employer and face extended unemployment or a job that doesn't offer health care benefits.<p>If they were still in employer provided coverage, they'd still being paying in their X per employee per year (simplifying away the differences between diferent employer-provided plans).  It might be time for the system to, on average, pay back some portion of all those accumulated premiums.  Sort of a ""whole life"" insurance policy, from a health insurance perspective.<p>Instead, the ""accrued benefit"" (I know this is a crude analogy) has fled along with the job.<p>Aside from arguments about innovation and economic growth, the current health care insurance model in the U.S. is simply not coherent nor predictable with regard to providing coverage.  For many, a third party -- one increasingly having wildly diverging interests -- is in control of their coverage.<p>Many people would be happy to pay into a pool at the kind of pricing the major employers receive.  But as independents, they don't have that option.",1310617356

2761699,comment,2759002,2759002,5,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"The act of writing software can be summarized as generating ideas and writing down these ideas in a language computers can understand and execute. Software programmers are in the business of writing ideas all day. This combined with the fact that the bar for ideas being patentable is very low means that programmers probably generate and write down multiple patentable ideas per day. From the get go they are inevitably setting up a huge patent minefield.<p>I dont know if anyone has ever calculated the average density of patentable ideas in code, but if you consider, for example, that performing an online transaction with the last entered customer data (the infamous 1-Click patent) is patentable, I would very roughly estimate that there is a patentable idea every 20 to 50 lines of code.
As an example, the Linux kernel (just the very core of Linux) contains more that 10 millions lines of code. If you consider a complete Linux distribution (by adding the graphical user interface and a bunch of utilities) you get at least ten times that amount, that is more than 100 millions lines of code. Using the rough estimate above, we can calculate that there are more than 2 millions patentable ideas in a consumer operating system. That is an incredible amount of complexity. In fact, it is a testament to human ingenuity that we can (sometimes) get all this code to work together.<p>Now code is not used side by side like an infantry of little computer processes working in parallel to make computers or phones go. It is rather organised and packaged in a huge network of building blocks, a pyramid of hundreds of thousands of libraries, APIs or functions heavily inter-dependent on each other. Whats more, the building blocks are usually not all written by the same people or organisations and their consistent and stable behavior is critical for enabling compatibility (remember, often between millions of parts made by thousands of developers).<p>This hierarchical and networked architecture is inevitable and the best way to organise complex information, however the stability it requires at the bottom of the pyramid means that some building blocks cannot be changed once the pyramid is built. Someone claiming ownership of the shape of a bottom block after the pyramid is built, someone having the power to force a bottom block to be removed and replaced with a different shaped one, no matter how simple and obvious this bloc is, does not have power over just this block but over the whole structure above it and all the components that depend on it. This means patent holders have a disproportionately large amount of power when they target such a bloc. They know that changing it would require tearing down, redesigning and replacing often thousands of dependent projects and probably break compatibility for millions of users of these projects. It is usually simply not an option.",1310616338

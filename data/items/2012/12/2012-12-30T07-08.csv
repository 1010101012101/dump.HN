Meanwhile, Paul Lauterbur expanded on Carr's technique and developed a way to generate the first MRI images, in 2D and 3D, using gradients. In 1973, Lauterbur published the first nuclear magnetic resonance image.[25][26] and the first cross-sectional image of a living mouse was published in January 1974.</i> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging</a><p>Granted, improve things enough and you end up with qualitative differences.

The reasons that the housing market is so messed up in SF basically boil down to the following:<p>* Rent control - provides a huge disincentive for landlords to upgrade, invest in, (or for the unscrupulous) maintain their properties.  It also artificially limits housing supply and saps liquidity, since people who've been in their units for long periods of time have distorted prices and very limited incentive to move or upgrade.<p>* Onerous city bureaucracy and regulatory environment - the myriad, overlapping, and draconian sets of rules governing property development and ownership have made new development unnecessarily time- and capital-intensive.  Oh, and there's always the tenant's union and the ridiculously pro-tenant judiciary, but that's a story for another day.<p>* Prop 13 - basically this drives a distortion of property tax rates, with a disproportionate share of the tax burden falling on residential households and newcomers to the city/state.<p>Note that as (relatively) long-term owners in SF, we've done very well thanks to (2) and (3).",1356854205

4984980,comment,4984276,4984768,1,0,_delirium,,,"I agree the wealthy will generally get to live where they want. I think there can be some variation in where they want to live, though, depending on policies. Some wealthy definitely want to live in urban areas, and others definitely want to live in suburban areas, but for others it may depend: for example, if you build shiny new condo towers with modern amenities, there are people who currently wouldn't consider moving into a dilapidated Mission complex who <i>would</i> consider buying one of those new condos and moving up to the city. So you might bring in some new rich people to SF depending on what gets built. The worry some anti-gentrification people seem to have is that the end result will be that the new demand gets soaked up by new rich people, and the only place demand is lowered is not so much a city-wide basis as a metropolitan-area-wide basis: prices go down in outlying suburbs, which is where the poor people then have to move. That's what seems to be happening in NYC: every time a new neighborhood is gentrified, poor people have to move another 15 minutes further away from work, into yet another further-out area with worse transit.<p>Some people hope to make the city stay unattractive to rich people, so they prefer to live on the Peninsula or North Bay (or in NYC, maybe some nice condo towers on Jersey's ""gold coast""). So you still have the golden ghetto, so to speak, but you try to put it elsewhere. Even leaving aside whether that's a good goal, I think it's certainly a good question whether current policy will actually do that; it's quite possible anti-growth policies won't have that effect anyway (e.g. Paris's anti-growth policy has certainly not resulted in a non-gentrified Paris). The interconnections are pretty interesting though, and seem hard to model, especially with the existing data points (e.g. NYC) having, as you point out, their own oddities.",1356852276

When instances of oppression occur, the most important thing to do is not point out the hypocrisies of the victim. It's not to whine about the oppression that YOU have to deal with yourself. It's not to compare your minor suffering to their systematic bullying. Everyone suffers, everyone has their own battles. Now is not the time to dredge it up as if it's more important, or just as important as what is happening here.<p>No, name calling is not racism. not on its own. It must indeed be backed by a system of oppression. A system of belief about the inherent qualities of a particular race.

Why on earth would such a maint process exist in the first place? I can imagine some possibilities here of course but it feels to me there is more to it than what they've chosen to disclose.<p>Next. So they lose config data but data path for now not impacted. Fine, makes sense. But then backend, with only partial data, attempts to reconfig running LBs, doesn't fail completely (as in it was able to connect and do at least something but not all actions it was supposed to do) thus forcing otherwise good but impaired LBs into a completely bad state. Sunds suspicious to me.<p>And then the biggest question - why did they choose to attempt to restore entire backend database when only 6.8% of LBs were impacted?<p>I also have no idea how a CM process can protect against making a mistake - mistakes happen when somebody is at the controls with or without prior coordination.<p>All in all, their backend systems are so sophisticated and precisely engineered that any unforeseen/unexpected abnormality caused by manual intervention (be it inadvertent run of a maint script or fat fingered traffic re-routing from primary to backup network) inevitably lead to overwhelming reaction of their automation that makes the problem even worse and extremely hard to recover from.<p>Very tough position to be in - during these outages, they are essentially fighting the skynet that they themselves created and at their scale there is no way around it.<p>So hats off to those who've been working on this and good luck taming the beast.",1356850974

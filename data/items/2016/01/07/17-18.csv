Most concerning are:<p>1) In the entire long-winded complaint, there isn&#x27;t even a mention of the primary thrust of PG&#x27;s essay—while some income inequality is caused by rent-seeking and bad behavior, some is also caused by productivity inequality. Productivity is more unevenly distributed than ever, and the trend will likely become more extreme as technology advances.<p>2) Intentionally confusing the definitions of &quot;start-up&quot; and &quot;small business&quot;. Despite having acknowledged the that the meaning of the term was an issue, he still plowed forward and sited &quot;start-up&quot; statistics that were counting all businesses, primarily small businesses.",1452189599

10859511,comment,10850084,10856306,0,0,moosey,,,"I think it&#x27;s an opinion that is easily stated, but not easily done.  It&#x27;s easy to have kids and say they are your pride and joy, but not take it seriously.  It&#x27;s a very serious burden IF you are serious about raising kids properly.  It requires study for each area of life that they enter, careful attention to their needs while trying to develop independence.  It&#x27;s very hard and utterly horrifying.  Seeing other parents yell at teachers when their students are falling behind represents to me how dire the situation is, and I see that too often, and I read about it too often.  I see it in my own extended family, where a history of neglect and lack of discipline have produced people that are essentially useless in society.  But they all still say that their children are their pride and joy.  I don&#x27;t believe they know what it means to take parenting seriously.<p>Yes, I agree with you, it&#x27;s very easy to be a hypocrite about this statement.  There exists a serious moral bankruptcy in many areas of modern US society that allow people to be hypocrites, to take what they say at face value and just accept it (TV Evangelistic preachers with private jets???).<p>I like to believe I am taking the job seriously.  Having a baby is basically &#x27;Congratulations, you had sex&#x27;.  Raising a child ranges from tossing a baby in a dumpster to making sure that they are the temporal and financial focus in your lives, and probably further.",1452189533

At no point do you do a &quot;big rewrite&quot;, at no point do you have a big step back, at no point do you lose the ability to make forward progress because the new code isn&#x27;t ready and the old code is deprecated, etc. Even if it may take somewhat longer to get there, the integral of value over time often still comes out larger for incremental improvement.<p>Developers want the default answer to &quot;abandon the old mess and write a new one&quot; (snarkiness fully on purpose); Joel&#x27;s point is that the default answer ought to be incremental improvement. Not that it&#x27;s <i>always</i> the right answer, but other answers ought to be scrutinized more closely than developers might like.<p>From a professional point of view, it&#x27;s actually <i>perfectly fair</i> to consider that greenfielding a new project with hot new tech (or even &quot;newer&quot;-but-established tech, my personal favorite choice) is more fun than trudging through old code. Human factors matter a lot. But we are also professionally obligated not to overprivilege it.<p>Besides, if you treat it as a serious project instead of a series of hack jobs, in my experience, very serious incremental improvement still offers a lot of engineering challenge and fun. I think one of the biggest mistakes people make is to prejudge incremental improvements as a hack job, when it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.",1452189071

Once you can understand the big picture, the individual lines of code have a context that helps understand their purpose and how they perform it.<p>- Discuss with your lead engineer what his expectations are for your progress. Very senior people I have talked to will claim that it takes 6 months - 1 year before a new hire can really start to contribute. Longer if it is a legacy system as you are facing.

The new government, press and education cadres for the most part consisted of ethnic Koreans from China, Manchuria, and the Soviet Union, and relatively few came from Korean resistance fighters that stayed in the Korea proper. Kim Il Sung himself fought in Manchuria in 1930s and entered Korea in 1945 as a captain in the Red Army.<p>The politics and ideology were built on Soviet blueprints under Soviet supervision [1]. Soviet influence can still be seen in the Party jargon and the formal political language [2].<p>It wasn&#x27;t until the late 50s that Kim Il Sung won the political infighting and secured his hold on power, simultaneously breaking out from under Soviet and Chinese control and introducing the ideology of self-reliance and isolationism.<p>In South Korea, however, Rhee Syngman did not have the choice of importing unsullied cadres (e.g. a vanishingly small percentage of American Koreans in 1940s had higher education), and so did had not much choice but to rely on the Korean collaborators [3]:<p><i>Rhee himself had been an independence activist, and his relations with the Chinilpa Korean elites who had collaborated with the Japanese were in the words of the South Korean historian Kyung Moon Hwang often &quot;contentious&quot;, but in the end an understanding was reached, whereas in exchange for their support, Rhee would not purge the elites. In particular, the Koreans who had served in the colonial-era National Police, whom the Americans had retained after August 1945 were promised by Rhee that their jobs would not be threatened by him. Upon independence in 1948, 53% of South Korean police officers were men who had served in the National Police during the Japanese occupation.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terentii_Shtykov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terentii_Shtykov</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nknews.org/2014/08/north-korean-dialect-as-a-soviet-russian-translation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nknews.org/2014/08/north-korean-dialect-as-a-sovi...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngman_Rhee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngman_Rhee</a>",1452188977

At a macro level the key issue is the ever increasing importance of China and India. China is the world’s second largest economy, but already much larger than the US in a broad swathe of sectors. India will be the world’s third largest economy within a decade. Unfortunately their rise is increasing the global cost of capital because an ever growing share of the most important data they produce is simply not credible. Currently stated Chinese real GDP growth is 7.1% and India’s is 7.4%. Both are substantially over stated. This obfuscation and distortion of data, whether deliberate or inadvertent, makes it increasingly difficult to forecast macro and hence micro as well, for an ever growing share of our investment universe.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/nevsky-capital-closing-letter-2016-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/nevsky-capital-closing-letter...</a>",1452188506

Decide what behaviors might be problematic. Decide if any are actually serious enough to require immediate medical treatment. Those that aren&#x27;t can be addressed gradually over time...children tend to grow out of behaviors all on their own. It&#x27;s within the range of normal for five year olds to squirm, climb, and jump. Deal with problematic behaviors gently and compassionately in age appropriate ways.<p>4. A five year old should not be focused on school work unless it is interesting and fun. Neither should ten year olds. Our employers often pay us to work because it can be dull and unpleasant. We don&#x27;t have ADHD.<p>5. Every child is different.

Feeling totally stuck.",,"I graduated college a few months ago and recently started working as an entry-level software developer at a big company in the silicon valley.<p>I once worked as an intern back-end web application developer, and it wasn&#x27;t too challenging because most of the frameworks I worked with had an immense amount of online resources to learn from. And the code base wasn&#x27;t too big so it was easy to pick up on.<p>But at my new job I&#x27;m working with a 20+ year old enterprise code base that relies on internal tools with ambiguous documentation. I don&#x27;t have a mentor assigned to me, but I do work closely with the lead engineer to ramp up. A good portion of what he says goes over my head, so I either ask for clarifying questions or take notes and do research on my own.<p>There&#x27;s a lot I don&#x27;t know. I made an effort to keep notes of everything my coworkers and lead engineer say, as well as documenting my progress in learning all the technologies. In some ways I&#x27;m expanding my knowledge daily, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quickly as I&#x27;d like, and sometimes when my coworkers ask if I understand how x or y works and I don&#x27;t, it seems like I&#x27;ve made no progress on learning at all.<p>This is my 2nd month here. The first month I spent setting up my dev environment and waiting to be granted permissions to various services. Now that I have a real assignment, I slog through this massive code base and have no idea what I&#x27;m doing. I ask for help but have a lot of stupid questions and feel like I&#x27;m wasting everybody&#x27;s time because I can&#x27;t resolve things on my own. I generally have a good idea of what I don&#x27;t know and how to learn it, but in a lot of cases I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know and thus don&#x27;t know what to ask, or how to ask a good question.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m being too hard on myself since I&#x27;ve only just started working and it&#x27;s my 2nd month, but a part of me feels like I should be getting better at figuring things out a lot faster.",1452188105

According to me, they will live long enough to either vote in comprehensive reform or to organize and rebel from a dearth of it.<p>Right, so when does the rebellion come? Why would you rebel ever when &quot;someone will do it anyway&quot;, like that is some law of nature? According to you, hypothetical black kid should snitch on others when threatened to get beaten or arrested, and why wouldn&#x27;t they -- if they don&#x27;t snitch, someone else will do it, and the only difference would be their life being worse. Leaflet #3 of the White Rose comes to mind: &quot;<i>Do not hide your cowardice under the cloak of cleverness!</i>&quot; And I think we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree.<p>> If you quit a job in the military-industrial complex for which you have some ethical concerns, such as one which enables dragnet surveillance, what is the meaningful consequence?<p>I already said what it is for me and in my opinion, personal moral hygiene. The consequence is that you are no longer part of that. That is plenty meaningful to me. As Frankenstein said in The Death Race, (paraphrasing), &quot;You can&#x27;t save the world, you can maybe save a part of it, yourself&quot;. Well, I don&#x27;t remember the exact quote, but that&#x27;s how I feel about it. I don&#x27;t even believe in something like a soul, but still, I would say saving your soul, retaining what little remains of our innocence, is the best anyone can achieve.<p>And as many found out, death doesn&#x27;t always immediately follow making a stand. George Carlin found himself entertaining people he didn&#x27;t like, the establishment, with cute things, and he pivoted. Had a long career, had a family, was heard, never sold out, never compromised. Noam Chomsky also has plenty haters, and I&#x27;m sure plenty who would love to see him hurt, but he is still rocking on.<p>> When you mention in job interviews that you left due to ethical conflicts with the former employer, you never seem to be a good &quot;cultural fit&quot;.<p>Then either don&#x27;t mention it, or don&#x27;t interview for jobs with assholes. Get another job, and help take the assholes down. Do whatever you want, of course, but I don&#x27;t see the dilemma here. It&#x27;s not that black and white, i.e. either you go along or you&#x27;re screwed. Actually, plenty people get screwed even though they&#x27;re very obedient and have no flavour and no stance of their own.  And as Lily Tomlin said, &quot;The trouble with the rat race is, even if you win, you&#x27;re still a rat.&quot; And you know, I don&#x27;t quote this to put anyone else down, it&#x27;s how I feel inside. Man, it&#x27;s not just a feeling, it&#x27;s a pretty solid thing. I had a lot of shit broken for me for trying to do the right thing, and had a lot of frustration and sadness for not just &quot;popping soma&quot; and going along, for questioning things. Yet I would not do it differently, given then the chance to do it again. I might be smarter or more patient about some things, but in general, I feel I got <i>way</i> more out of it than I lost. It&#x27;s not just what it does to how I feel inside, it&#x27;s also what it does to my perception, which is muddled, but less muddled as it would otherwise be. I see and speak with people who made and are making different decisions every day, and I don&#x27;t envy a single one of them.<p>> Sometimes, you can&#x27;t avoid it, but you should always try to not die as you work towards your goals.<p>Nobody (or hardly anybody) just keels over dead and thinks that advances any cause or does any good. It&#x27;s usually &quot;doing something or saying something, and then not stopping to do or say it even though others threaten you&quot;.

By definition, something ambitious has a high possibility of failure - if failing means that your career is destroyed, then people won&#x27;t do it.",1452186582

You probably won&#x27;t be programming all the time, at least not after whatever project they have in mind is in a stable place. You will potentially be responsible for reporting/BI/analytics, systems architecture and administration, tech support (Yes, everyone is going to ask you for help with their computers), and anything else tech-related that comes up along the way. If you want to stay in good shape as a programmer, you&#x27;ll be responsible to find the focused time to code, keeping your skills sharp and current, and staying motivated to do so. At this time, you&#x27;d normally go work with an established development team who can guide and mentor you, as well as balance the team so that you have time and resources with which to further your skills.<p>The only thing in your post that makes me think this may be a good opportunity to explore is when you mention entrepreneurship as your long-term goal.

Ideally the free tier should be enough for a very casual users, or enough to test, but once they get serious they are incentivized to purchase something. You could try doing a timed trial too - 30 day for free usage perhaps. As others have mentioned I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much if you need to lower prices in the future - as long as you reduce the monthly fee that your older customers get I am sure they will be happy.<p>Also what kind of marketing are you doing? Often with projects that one is passionate about the drive is to build more features as opposed to build a user base. I think your product is developed enough feature-wise (I am certainly looking forward to trying it now that I have heard of it), and so I wonder what you are doing to build your user base. Off the top of my head I would suggest talking to people in language learning forums & communities, creating a newsletters / reminders to keep your existing users engaged, and possibly running targeted advertisements if you haven&#x27;t already.",1452186114

Look at the latest report from the World Health Organization on the carcinogenic properties of meat for just one recent example. All meat is high in saturated and trans fat, has animal cholesterol, has industrial pollutants which bio-accumulate in fatty tissue. It really isn&#x27;t just the moral and environmental imperatives which should cause one to question the habit of eating animals - your own health greatly depends on it.

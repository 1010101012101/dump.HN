What I can do, and have been trying to do, is to help you identify what those factors are so you can answer it yourself.<p>You have HR experience; that's good.  You say you know exactly what is needed for a Recruitment management tool.  That's also good.  Of course, before you start developing, you're going to want to validate your business idea.  You need to do what's called ""customer development"", and make sure that the product you are designing meets the needs of others in the field, and not just your own needs (when you were working in HR).<p>You'll also want to look at the competition.  What other Recruitment management tools are out there?  What are people currently using?  By looking at these, and talking to prospective customers, you should be able to get a good idea whether having this app on the web will add value, or only add risk (in terms of security).<p>Which brings me to my final point: being ""addicted to programming"" isn't going to help you.  To create a piece of Enterprise software, you're going to have to know one platform inside and out.  You're going to want to have already developed several smaller (non-Enterprise) apps on this platform.  And, you're going to want to have a staff of developers that is already trained and comfortable on this platform.<p>The recent mess with Diaspora is a good example of what happens when people try to build complex, enterprise-quality software on platforms they don't already know intimately.",1285333109

1723464,comment,1720756,1722370,0,0,elblanco,,,"Ircle - Gah! That's like everything that was ever wrong with GUI design. Disconnected windows implies disconnected functionality, overly complex design, buttons . There's no indicator that the input area has anything to do with the chat log. I can see why the interface styles are moving <i>away</i> from that type of design. IRC is supposed to be <i>simple</i> Ircle makes it look like I'm piloting a nuclear sub and a squadron of UAVs at the same time. I know it's old, so it gets a free pass for not being up to date on UI design. But the thing I find hard to believe about Ircle is that it lives on Macs -- the holy sanctuary from bad UI design. (and I'd like to point out how very few controls they jam into the menu bar at top, Ircle is a perfect example of Fitt's law in non-use).<p>CS5 - Tabs can be a powerful thing when done right, CS5 does not do them right. I strongly dislike Photoshop's tab implementation. Though I'd never in a million years hold up Photoshop (with its aging wretched evolutionary interface cruft) as an example for people to follow in UI design.<p>Maximize - I've known many people who use the exact phrase ""maximize every damn thing"" when referring to people's desire to maximize windows to focus on one thing at a time. I've actually sat down with them to discuss their UI behavior and observe how they use their smaller non-maximized windows. What I discovered was fascinating. Instead of focusing on one particular thing at a time, and moving their mouse around inside screen sized real-estate, with nothing else cluttering up their visual field, they <i>focused on one particular thing at a time</i> except they had a much smaller area to work in, things became cluttered and they often got distracted or confused by non-relevant stuff in the background. They spent inordinate amount of time moving windows around to get them positioned well to not be distracting or so they could see them all well (as if the other document they were writing was going to suddenly change state without their notice and they wanted to see that happen - yes this was how it was described exactly to me), and fiddling with toolbars so they were ""just so"". If I didn't know better, I'd classify most of the behaviors as OCD type worry twitches. The real problem is that if you want to maximize and focus on a Mac, you simply can't. Whereas on Windows or many Linuxes, I can choose either method of operation -- like if I writing some code and have a separate app up logging network activity or something, I can do that. But if I'm having a particularly bad time killing a bug, I simply can't maximize and get <i>everything</i> else out of the way.<p>There is a built in efficiency in killing off tasks serially that you sometimes can't get when operating in parallel.<p>Thanks for the command-option-h tip.",1285332817

However, hopefully some of this will click.<p>First, to answer your question: Yes.<p>Simple enough.  However, what are your sales and marketing team doing?  Obviously not selling.  But how are they going about doing it?<p>Trade shows?  Trade magazines? Cold calling?  Flying down and meeting with people?  All of these are methods my sales guys used when I started my company.  Trade shows were the best. They let them promote their product, and actually talk to the people involved.  They got to know their  potential clients.  You aren't trying to sell a product.  Your trying to help them run a business.<p>You need a good feedback loop from your sales guys, too.  They can't just sell.  They need to market.  They need to bring the clients to you, but also you to the clients.<p>Basically, you need to become apart of the industry you are targeting.  Right now it seems like you are trying to sell something to them.  That's not the right way to look at it.  Basically, how can you help your industry.<p>You discount their reasons for not wanting to join as being traditional.  Why?  Not the reason they give you, but really, why?  I find a lot of the reasons is that, in truth, the technology route is often more cumbersome for a large number of things.<p>But really, it all comes down to meeting the people in the industry and becoming apart of that industry.<p>I remember the first trade show we went to.  Our booth had banners and marketing material, and my sales guys pimping the promise of a product we didn't have completed yet.  We kept going back, and went to many more throughout the world.  It's much easier to get someone to try your product after you've met face to face, shared a drink, or taken them out to dinner.",1285331448

1723383,comment,1723140,1723140,0,0,brlewis,,,"Yes, it is just a matter of good sales and marketing, in the same way that building your online software was just a matter of programming.<p>It's often said that it's better to have technical-only founders, because it's easier for them to learn the non-technical aspects of business than it is for non-technical people to learn the technical side.  This is true, but it's predicated on technical people actually putting in the effort to learn.<p>I'm still learning sales and marketing myself, so don't take what I say as gospel, but I think the solution to your problem has two parts.  The first part is an intensive, non-sustainable effort to win your first few customers.  See edw519 for how to go about it.  After you win your first customers, things will get easier, by which I mean possible.<p>Seeing other people have success with your product is an essential part of the sales process, so once you get your first few customers it won't be like pushing water up a hill anymore.  It will be like pushing large rocks up a hill -- difficult, but not impossible.<p>The second part of your solution itself has two distinct parts: selling the problem, then selling the solution.  You have to separate selling the problem out as a separate activity.  Blog posts are part of this, but won't be enough by themselves.  You'll have to figure out the rest on your own.  Once you've sold the problem, you're ready to sell the solution.  Pointing to other people having success with it will have much more effect than any of your logical reasoning as to why your solution fits the problem.<p>When people say a good product sells itself, they don't really mean it.  It's like if we programmers say that with a good requirements document, software writes itself.  What we really mean is that with a good requirements document, someone who knows what he or she is doing can write the software with minimal struggle and creativity.<p>Your next challenge is to become somebody who knows what you're doing in the sales/marketing area.  Until you do this, it will be as hard to bring in an appropriately skilled sales/marketing person as it is for a non-technical founder to bring in an appropriately skilled programmer.",1285330056
1723382,comment,1723178,1723178,0,0,smoody,,,"Here's where he argument falls apart... and he should understand this, and I'm surprised he doesn't -- yes, money is available from many sources. Perhaps some of you even have rich uncles or aunts who can throw cash at you. But, the reason some angels rise above others is: the value and power of their network. This translates directly into an ability to help a startup a) get follow-on funding, b) get some initial biz-dev deals and alliances, c) get some press. That's what separates a top-tier angel from a second-tier angel.<p>It's a fact that, as with VCs, some entrepreneurs (the smart ones in my opinion) will take money at a slightly lower evaluation from the top-tier angels than a higher valuation from second tier angels, because anyone can throw money at a startup, but not everyone has a powerful business network and collection of relevant portfolio companies to contribute (the classic ""smart money vs. dumb money"" argument that you'll hear over-and-over once you start to try raising money).<p>Let's create a fictional example using Y Combinator... Let's say that PG just announced that he's going to take 1% more of companies that are accepted into his accelerator than the competing accelerators take. If you believe Scoble's argument, then people should just go to another incubator because there are plenty around, but many, if not all, would probably give up 1% more because they get more than 1% of extra value out of being involved with Y Combinator. My guess is that the deal flow into Y Combinator would not change all that much.<p>That's what's at stake here. It seems like people are assuming that these guys want to cut valuations in half or something like that. What if they just want to drop them by 2%? Seems trivial -- almost laughable -- but that 2% could mean tens of millions of additional profit in the pockets of these top-tier angels. And when an entrepreneur is given two offers -- one from a top tier angel that has a 2% lower valuation than a competing offer from an angel that is just getting their start in the industry -- which will they take?<p>Scoble is coming at this as a reporter and not as an entrepreneur. It's a lot more slippery when you look at it from the eyes of an entrepreneur.",1285330047

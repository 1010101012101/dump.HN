4316910,comment,4314507,4315960,4,0,peterwwillis,,,"The problem is this isn't a novel idea. Replacing a fast webserver with somebody else's fast webserver is half of the reason most people choose CDN's (the other reason usually being bandwidth). Just using someone else's fast webserver does not obsolete a different fast webserver.<p>It's totally acceptable that you might not have the infrastructure to serve all of your static content from your measely web servers and 100mbit connection. CDNs are a great choice here. But this has nothing to do with what web server you use, nor does it mean you should process every request dynamically just because right now you have the resources for it using a CDN.<p>Even with a CDN and an extremely efficient static content layer, you still have to hand out dynamic content to your users individually which a CDN generally will not help with. At a high enough number of requests you will run out of resources (RAM, CPU, Disk, Network, etc). At this point it's handy to have the fastest things you can so scaling doesn't become one huge clusterfuck. Then whoever re-implements Nginx to help handle requests will write a blog post about how Nginx makes CDNs obsolete.<p>My point before (and now) is: Caching matters, and having a fast frontend web server matters, and CDNs matter, and none of this is directly related: we're talking apples and oranges.<p>As an aside, CloudFlare seems to use a novel little fast web server:<p><pre><code>  psypete@pinhead ~/ :) wget -S -O /dev/null http://4chan.org/ 2>&1 | grep -e ""^[[:space:]]\+Server:""

Our engineers who work here actually make a good grid and good systems. Heck it hasn't collapsed in a long long while.<p>I think the collapse has more to do with people drawing more due to subsidies and political sops than anything else. And thats not something privatization is going to fix directly.<p>Matter of fact, so far Govt contracts have been the more exacting contracts from what I have come across, and the private ones except for the MNCs have been the more lax.<p>Further - from what I can see, the government contracts for a lot of these things are open and if you are in the country, you can bid for it. (Be you Siemens or Kirloskar)
And those contracts? like the BGLR Metro order? Thats vetted and checked against by govt engineers.<p>The way the contracts are being set up in many places, end up favoring large firms. And AFAIK MNCs aren't paying bribes.<p>So we already have privatization with regulations and accountability to an extent.<p>You could say we need more and I won't disagree. We are moving towards that.<p>------------<p>Unsaid when discussing ""privatization"" is that it's tough to work in India. Competition is harsh and margins razor thin. I know that some companies would rather sell in other places than this market for better profits with less effort.<p>What I want to say is that you are painting a dark picture, but having more first hand knowledge at the moment, the picture is a lot more grey, and lighting up.<p>If you want to see how real estate developers fare on their own, you should always remember the message of gurgaon.

That's about $2.7m in revenue if those numbers are correct.  They also have PRO accounts for $500/month - no idea the number of accounts.  Obviously the numbers could be bullshit, but I've seen a fair number of Fortune 500 companies (Shell Oil, etc) using their service.<p>It's been a while since I looked at their site/tools, but I thought built their own Twitter that runs alongside Twitter, although I'd be curious what percentage of posts end up on Stocktwits network vs. Twitter.  If that is still the case, clearly they were concerned about being overly dependent on Twitter.<p>My point is just that the $ isn't the business - and honestly, I don't see why this does anything but make their lives actually easier.  That's my main complaint - what does this change for Howard?  Maybe it makes it easier for a competitor to build something similar, but what was really stopping them in any case?  Couldn't a competitor have just adopted the same methodology?<p>No connection to the company - just thought the info might be useful.",1343738349

His cinematography is great and I love him because of the ADD-style and music he uses, but a lot of information is very biased and, in very many cases, just plain false (e.g. In one of his movies he calls Herbert Marcuse the leader of the student movement of the 60s and shows a short clip of him talking.

4316888,comment,4316632,4316707,8,0,JulianMorrison,,,"Going by the description, if you know a file's plaintext, you know both its plaintext hash (decryption key) and its encrypted hash (storage key). The communication to request files uses the storage key. It would be rather easy to identify by statistical means, people who request files of a common type, for example known CP images. Forwarding a few requests for CP or having it stored doesn't indicate anything. Reading or writing a lot of known CP would be probable cause for a search. This is especially easy because the majority of CP is not new and FBI presumably has the whole damn lot on a hard disk somewhere. They can easily pre-compute hashes and just sit monitoring.<p>As a result, this network would be useless for CP-mongers, they'd get caught about as easily as using plain old FTP.<p>On the other hand, I do think the ability to pre-compute hashes is a flaw that massively reduces this network's usefulness to dissidents. It is quite effective as a ""publish a manifesto network"" with a secret writer and overt readers - the original write is of a never-before-seen file, there is no hash to monitor. It's unsafe as a ""store my pirated stuff"" network, writers of a well known file can be tracked. And it would take very little statistical monitoring to reveal the interests of a reader.",1343738244

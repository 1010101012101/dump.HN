2262806,comment,2262527,2262527,0,0,mynegation,,,"First of all, do not ever call yourself ""slow"" or ""not very smart"". This is just not true. I haven't realized that English is your primary language until you mentioned it Granted, English is not my native language either, but the point is: if you could get this far with the natural language you're definitely have anything but the learning disability. And having a stable job after dropping out of college is no small feat either.<p>Algorithms and Data structures. I have CS and Applied Math degrees, but honestly - very rarely I have to recall the inner workings of specific algorithms and data structures. It is useful to know how it all works, but not as important as you may think. You can certainly follow ""fake it till you make it"" approach: you need to remember memory and time complexities of the data structures and some implications, e.g. ""hash tables have asymptotically O(1) search time but may consume more memory than red-black trees that provide O(log(n)) search time but have guaranteed memory and search time constraints"". And so on and so forth. So go ahead and read Cormen with that in mind.<p>Also, my guess is that you need only as much CS as you need to become a better software developer. I don't think you want to be a theoretical computer scientist, do you?<p>In your situation I would also recommend reading following books:<p>""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"". Honestly, to CS graduate it reads like a book for preschoolers but it is very beautifully written and is almost zen-like. And it will definitely help you understand what programming is about if you did not get proper formal training.<p>""Design Patterns"". It is not a CS, but Software Engineering book. It provides a framework for your software design skills. You can be a great programmer without reading that book, but then you have to be exposed to a lot of beautifully designed code, and that book will save you a lot of time.<p>Find a popular and stable open source project that is closest to what you are doing now or what you want to do and read the code, look at the build infrastructure, documentation, try to get involved and maybe even fix some bugs, starting from simplest ones and moving up to features. You'll get a lot of brutally honest peer reviews, just don't abuse it.<p>Hope that helps.",1298653193

You don't need a book; you need a <i>project</i>.  I (like many others here, I'm sure) have achieved much, but have always had difficulty learning from books and theory.  It's hard!  You need to find work where the things you need to learn will be required.  Funny how quickly and easily you'll find a way to learn them when you actually need them.

I'm very skilled at gluing code together (gluing with skill, not throwing things together). At the end of the day, what matters is whether you can make things work, and nothing else.<p>> OTOH I have given thought about if programming is really for me, I have found that I'm really, really bad at problem solving and ""thinking outside of the box"" I have come to accept that I'm really not smart.

Join an acting class, especially one where <i>improvisation</i> is stressed (I recommend you find an acting school which teaches Lecoq's method).

I read each book.<p>Now that probably sounds like I am a genius, sucking down information directly from the text. But what really happened wasn't so flattering at all: I flailed. It wasn't until the third book or so that I finally got anything to compile, and I think it was book 4 where I figured out how the hell to read pointers.<p>I really sucked at learning programming.<p>When I picked up C++, we were on a family vacation. The kids all played in the pool and did fun stuff. I sat by the pool and read C++ books. If I thought C was tough, C++ was a killer.<p>I finally got it, though.<p>Last year, when I wanted to finally learn Functional Programming (I'm 45) I did the same thing. And this time, guess what? Even after the books I sucked.<p>So I started writing little projects, which also sucked.  I went back and read the books again. I wrote some more code. I still suck at it, but I suck a little less. Perhaps in another year or two I'll consider myself proficient.<p>Yes, it is terribly awesome to sit down in front of a client with a tough problem and do some wizardry on the screen and feel like the hero. I spent my 20s and part of my 30s being the super-hero star guy. I had a blast.<p>But that's just hot-dogging: showboating. (People do it for fun and to make their job more like a theater performance) In reality for every one of those times I was showboating there were hundreds of hours spent trying to figure out what the hell was going on with something.<p>I think it might be easy to look at other coders who are like I was and get the wrong impression. Yes, some folks are smarter or have a better recall than others, but guys with huge recall ability many times get wrapped up in some kind of minutia that's not important to the team. Everybody has flaws. This will sound very strange to hear, but it's true: you can be the worst programmer on a programming team and be the most valuable and critical person there. I've seen it happen dozens of times.<p>The question is: are you working at making yourself better? Not how smart you are, how you feel about programming, or any of that. Just a simple question about what kinds of habits you have in place to continue to improve. If you have those habits, you'll either become a better coder or eventually work out what you're meant to do. But you have to have those habits first.<p>So my advice is a little less angst and a little more work. Both to you and me :)<p>EDIT: By some kind of weird twist of fate I have been thinking about this a lot recently, because I was writing a review of the best book I've ever read that improved my coding, Code Complete. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2263127"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2263127</a>",1298652717

When you go out and teach yourself, don't be discouraged by failure. You shouldn't read technical books like a novel, no one does, and those who claim they do are just lying. For more on that you can read this: <a href=""http://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/History_Math/math-read.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/History_Math/math-read.htm</a><p>Which describes how math books (and other technical books by nature) should be read and studied. Don't think after reading a paragraph, you should understand everything. Take it slow, and take the time to work out things on your own, the more this happens the easier it gets.<p>Also, whether you are good or not at problem solving, just remember that you should be enjoying the process of solving problems, not necessarily just the answer. It took Steven Hawking 29 years to make a big step of progress with Black Holes. Experimenting is just as important as the thought process is. Read something, test it, break it, try to fix it.<p>You also stated you had difficulty looking from new perspectives. This is tricky, but first get your creativity flowing, then ask all of these question. Why? How? Why Not (INSERT SOMETHING ELSE)? Will it work with this? What is the fundamental idea? Is there a way to change the implementation of how this is done, while still maintaining the proper outcome? Scribble down your ideas, and play with them.<p>For example, I remember when I was trying to fix my indoor toy flying helicopter after the plastic broke on one of the propellers. Instead of taping it I asked myself, what it was exactly I was trying to do, which was reconnect a broken plastic propeller. Then I asked myself what ways this could be done. After fooling a bit, I decided that since it was plastic I could simply melt it back together. You just have to learn to break things down, and chunk them together, and play with the elements of a problem.<p>Keep reading, learning, most importantly have some fun.",1298652709

For example, many MIS/DSS/ERP/CRM/TLA systems don't provide a lot of public information about how their systems work, so if you are trying to evaluate the market place, it would probably take you 3-6 months of research.<p>For example, I work at a healthcare services start-up, and we have one person full-time researching our competitors and figuring out how to differentiate us in the marketplace, as well as figure out what keywords someone might search for to find this kind of product.  We're mainly mathematicians and smart programmers who found a way to break into the market initially, not marketers, so our terminology doesn't match domain experts well.<p>Anecdotally, I think most users are VERY bad at ranking how valuable information is.

Find groups for topics you are interested in and then involve yourself, ask questions, learn, then contribute to the discussion yourself.<p>4. Have you considered getting involved in some open source projects?  These are a great place to learn from others as well.<p>In the end learning isn't generally as simple as just reading a few books for most people.  I would consider starting with a few books on how to get your career development and your learning process on the right track and then go from there.  Even if you do decide you're not cut out for programming, what you learn from those books will be valuable no matter what path you choose.<p>The books I'd recommend:<p><a href=""http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer</a><p><a href=""http://www.pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-program...</a> (will admit to not reading this one but I hear very good things)<p>Yes I realize these are all PragPro books, what can I say, they are that good.",1298652512

2262740,comment,2261483,2261483,0,0,CountSessine,,,"Yes, this is something that I've been thinking about the last couple of days. Thunderbolt doesn't seem to be a complete protocol stack like USB - at least that's what Intel's emphasis on Thunderbolt's PCIe protocol implies. Rather, it seems to have a simple encapsulation protocol. Without a protocol stack you can't have stuff like class drivers or channel categories (bulk, isochronous, etc). Not unless you re-use another protocol or technology that also uses PCIe, like USB EHCI or something.<p>But then what does the EHCI talk to over the Thunderbolt-PCIe? An EHC? Where? On the Thunderbolt device? In the Thunderbolt cable? Or is the EHCI reprogrammed to include a software EHC? Maybe that's what how Thunderbolt will work - re-implement every hardware bus controller (SATA, USB, etc) in software. A peripheral plugged into a Thunderbolt port on a computer would be either<p>- A peripheral with a Thunderbolt connector itself, connected with a Thunderbolt-to-Thunderbolt cable. The peripheral would actually be communicating Thunderbolt-encapsulated USB packets (or SATA or whatever) with a software USB EHC in the computer.<p>- A legacy peripheral (USB/SATA/whatever) connected with an expensive Thunderbolt-to-USB cable. The cable would have to do the Thunderbolt encapsulation and transcoding for the peripheral. Again, it would be communicating with a software USB EHC in the computer.<p>I can kind of understand why Intel would be interested in this. If doing anything useful over Thunderbolt means implementing existing hardware controllers in software (SATA HBA, USB EHC, etc), Thunderbolt is going to be a great way of burning excess CPU cycles. Just as USB was a less CPU-efficient connector than Firewire, Thunderbolt may need even more CPU cycles. This would be a great technology to promote if you're in the business of selling people CPU cycles.",1298652235

So I recommend doing basically what you're doing: use existing textbooks to find out what you should learn, and learn it. Treat going through those books like a course.

- block a competitor
- acquire technology/product/service/customers for less than it would cost them to develop in house
- acquire experience (personnel)<p>Do you have an idea or a actual live project/business with customers and responsibilities and a code base?<p>Is it dear to you? If they bought it and then ran it into the ground, ignored it, killed it off (think: Yahoo!'s acquisition history with mybloglog, delicious, etc) - would you care? Would you be able to take the $ and move on to the next project or would it gnaw at you?<p>What's in it for you if you go forward with a partnership or acquisition?  Does the company provide other opportunities for you to pursue?  More capital to invest in this or other projects of yours?  Do they have a good history with acquisitions?<p>Do you have other ideas, goals, dreams, whatever which you could potentially have to shelve while you're tied up with the company?  Are you ok with that?<p>Do you have a solid sense yourself of what your goals are, ignoring whatever opportunity this other company offers?<p>My one bit of advice: get a lawyer familiar with commercial contracts & acquisitions who can sit in with you in the meeting.

You get a walkthrough of what fdisk is, then how to use it, then you use it to partition your disks.  Instead of selecting a filesystem from a dropdown, you make one with mke2fs.<p>I don't recall if Ubuntu even tells you what lilo or grub is.<p>The reason I like this is that it forces you to understand what is going on.  What is the /boot partition?  Why is that important?<p>Installing gentoo is going to force you to use tar, and wget.  It's going to force you to get comfortable on the command line.<p>It's also going to force you to understand what a kernel module is.  It's going to force you to understand things like: what chipset does my wireless card use?<p>It's hard.  And it takes forever.

Nepotism of the old (there is a much more succinct word for this, but it escapes me) and the incredibly long life expectancy of the population.  The nepotism of the old (someone please tell me the name for this) is causing issues in a few different ways.<p>The older government officials are notorious for taking private sector positions in the very industries they previously regulated.  This happens so frequently there is actually a Japanese phrase to describe it (again I can't remember for the life of me what this phrase is).  In America this happens, but isn't nearly as blatant or widespread.  It Japan it is a near guarantee.<p>The older population in Japan has a stranglehold on influencing public policy.  They are a huge block of voters who actually turn out for elections.  They consistently vote for, or force politicians to push for, unsustainable short-term solutions to problems.  Japan has a pension crisis similar to our social security problem.  Everyone knows it is unsustainable, yet the older people vote for it and push the burden onto the young.<p>The young people entering the economy don't have the job availability they need.  Old people aren't retiring as early as they once were and basically aren't getting out of the way for the young.  People are living longer and need to work longer.  As a result, young workers are forced to be underemployed and struggle to become part of the economy.<p>There is also the issue of failure being viewed as shameful.  There is very little entrepreneurial activity going on in the country so they don't have this potential of creating jobs for the economy.<p>The long life expectancy is exacerbating all of the above issues.  That said, Japan is a fascinating place, the projections towards the strain social security and medicare taking on our economy in the future are good proof that Japan may still offer insight towards our own future.",1298650503

If a ""bread-and-butter"" programmer is using a modern language and doesn't understand functions, the correct response by everyone involved is for that programmer to spend some time understanding functions.

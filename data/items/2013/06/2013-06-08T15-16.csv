A properly implemented QKD system is equivalent to a guarantee that the two key holders are the only one that have the key provided no interception was detected during distribution. However, in practice if there is a flaw in your implementation just like in normal cryptography it is possible to gain enough info to decrypt the transmitted information. I was just at Dr. Makarovs lab in waterloo, one of the first quantum cryptography hackers. They were exploiting such flaws as poor random number generators and optical components inherent reflection to gain information during key distribution on flawed systems. however these flaws are still not exploitable as commercial systems XOR the generated key with a traditional public key so in order to decrypt the information both the QKD and public key distribution must be cracked, which won&#x27;t happen until we have a quantum computer.",1370706488

<i>Description: Another news story highlighting the growing &quot;wealth gap&quot; between the rich and poor in the USA has Dan discussing countermeasures. What if the rich and powerful made fixing that imbalance a priority?</i><p>I can&#x27;t recall if the subject I am speaking to is the above, or below episode (probably below, his show notes are not linked to his site).<p>Dan Carlin goes into a very pessimistic (and somewhat realistic) description of why money in politics can only be solved by money, in politics. How if HE were to change policies, he would need (or wish to) see a cabal of billionaires. Ready to back actual reformists, and immediately cut them out of any re-elections if they are not holding to the reformist promises made (the below Ep). A political contract per se, with the most &quot;good intentioned&quot; billionaires. He also notes, this is rather unrealistic, as ones &quot;good intentions&quot; can be diametrically opposed to another (simplisitic example, The Koch brothers and Soros).<p>I&#x27;m not describing it well, but his premise is that you only change the top-levels by voting out the House/Senate that  change their tune once in office, thus you need the consequences of uber-rich who can, and have the ability, to oust them in a semi-quick (election cycle) function.<p>Pretty sure its the below Ep.<p><a href=""http://dancarlin.com/dccart/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&cPath=2&products_id=170"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dancarlin.com/dccart/index.php?main_page=product_musi...</a>
<i>Description: The only way Americans can change federal government policy is by voting for new political candidates. But what if those candidates ignore the positions they ran on once elected?

I use Bill Gates as an example, re: his ruthless and intelligent business acumen, turning towards solving philanthropical concerns. That &quot;moving of the cannons&quot; would be stellar (searching is broken for older articles, their was a fantastic Reuters, or FT on Bill Gates when he stepped down from MS to turn towards philanthropic causes, and (paraphrasing), &quot;it will be of awe to see the change his business mind, fundamental efficiencies in solving problems, will do for the world of [disease, whatever].&quot;)<p>I also think its silly to assume that though a billionaire has immense power/influence/&#x27;stability&quot; to withstand more pressures by the government, this is still the US government which can bring down countries, much less a rascally tech billionaire.<p>(I am on meds for post-surgey, apologies if this is rambling or incoherent).",1370706054

The NSA listening post at Osan in Korea has the SIGAD USA-31. Clark Air Force Base is USA-57.<p>PRISM is US-984XN.<p>Each SIGAD is basically a collection site, physical or virtual; the SIGAD alphanumerics are used to indicate the source of intelligence FOR a particular report.<p>The NSA often assigns classified code names to the product of SIGADs. These can be confused with the nicknames or proper names of the collection platforms themselves, which may or may not be classified. What PRISM does is classified; the fact that there is a &quot;PRISM&quot; tool that does something is not.<p>...<p>So: An analyst sits down at a desk. She uses a tool, like PRISM, to analyze information collected and deposited in a database, like CONTRAOCTAVE. Then she uses another tool, perhaps CPE (Content Preparation Environment), to write a report based on the analysis. That report is stored in ANOTHER database, like MAUI. MAUI is a database for finished NSA intelligence products. Anchory is an intelligence community-wide database for intelligence reports.</i><p>---------------<p>And here is the core of it:<p><i>This is all very complicated, and that is on purpose. But this brief tutorial is important. PRISM is a kick-ass GUI that allows an analyst to look at, collate, monitor, and cross-check different data types provided to the NSA from internet companies located inside the United States.<p>The programs that use PRISM are focused, as the government said yesterday, on foreign intelligence. A lot of foreign intelligence runs through American companies and American servers.<p>...<p>Now, these accounts are being updated in real-time. So Facebook somehow creates a mirror of the slice of stuff that only the NSA can access. The selected/court-ordered accounts are updated in real-time on both the Facebook server and the mirrored server. PRISM is the tool that puts this all together. Facebook has no idea what the NSA is doing with the data, and the NSA doesn&#x27;t tell them.</i><p>So, PRISM is the name of the software application(s) used by an analyst that allows them to pull together all the various pieces of data that they receive from these companies, along with other sources, for their analysis.<p>Which of course, explains why the companies have never heard of this name. There is no reason for them to have.<p>And what the NSA has isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;direct access&quot; to the servers - PRISM gives the analyst &quot;direct access&quot; to the data that has already been collected by many different means.",1370705848

Treat them with respect. This may go as far as allowing them to leave, which seems counter to what we want, but still. &quot;Treat them with respect&quot; is very broad but no matter what angle you think from, it works.<p>For example, employees get bored because they are consistently doing work which is far below their skill level in a vocation which they haven&#x27;t fully explored[1]. The respectful thing to do would be to either find work that is more challenging for this employee or allow them to move on to greener pastures, giving them great references and even assisting find their ideal role. If they do move on, whoever used to be our second best employee in that area becomes the best we have, who will be closer to what we need in terms of skills, whilst maintaining a great relationship with the previous employee.<p>Also, if I&#x27;m overseeing an absolute wizard at what they do and they are far better than me at it, they deserve respect by being listened to when they offer advice when it comes to their craft. They deserve recognition of skill and if something isn&#x27;t feasible or if there&#x27;s a better way, I damn well better make sure I do it their way for the sake of my product/service/building/whatever and for the sake of my employee&#x27;s general wellbeing. Hell, if they&#x27;re that good, perhaps I can entrust them with a little bit more. After all, we should be hiring people to both do the jobs we haven&#x27;t got the time for anymore and, at the same time, do them better than us.<p>Telling an employee &quot;do x by this time and you get a promotion&quot; is not respectful either. This will create a bad culture, where cutting corners is rewarded where as doing your best work and offering sound advice is ignored or punished.<p>It&#x27;s really interesting to talk about theories of motivation, value and what not, I&#x27;ve done this and applying tactics and strategies like this works but it&#x27;s overcomplicating shit that can be kept simple: treat everyone with respect, treat everyone as you&#x27;d like to be treated. It&#x27;s very motivating going to your manager and saying &quot;look, I need work that&#x27;s a bit more challenging&quot; and them replying with &quot;understood mate. give me a bit of time and we&#x27;ll work something out&quot; (and, for brevity, ignoring the conversation in between of what exactly &#x27;more challenging&#x27; means). It&#x27;s very motivating your manager calling on you to give advice on the best course of action, rather than dictating how things will be done.  This is simply respect.<p>You should aim to give absolute respect to every person you work with, who works under you and works above you. Hell, you should do this for everyone in your life. Whether they return in kind is irrelevant, just keep at it. Sometimes those who haven&#x27;t treated you right before will warm to you.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Challenge_vs_skill.svg/300px-Challenge_vs_skill.svg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Cha...</a>

Of course now that computers are 1.0e+6 times faster than they were when it was developed, it&#x27;s not as noticeable, and people have been trained (browbeaten) to let things &quot;settle down&quot; before expecting their keyboard events to go to the right window.<p>But believe me, on a 4 meg diskless Sun 3/50 running X11, Emacs and a C compiler, with expensive context switching and paging over the network, it took a very perceptible (in fact terribly dreadful) amount of time for events to be delivered when you clicked, typed, and moved windows around, and it was a big issue.<p>Strict guarantees on synchronous event distribution are necessary to implement reliable &quot;mouse ahead&quot;, for gestural user interfaces like pie menus, and reliable window management and keyboard input focus tracking.<p>Having the window manager running as an outboard process, communicating via an asynchronous protocol, is a terrible idea, but is baked into X11 at a very low level -- with the ICCCM thrown in as a kludgy afterthought. The X11 protocol has hacks and band-aids like &quot;mouse button grabs&quot; and &quot;server grabs&quot; to mitigate the problems, but they cause a lot of other problems, complexity and inefficiencies on their own.<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS</a>:<p>Like the view system in most GUIs, NeWS included the concept of a tree of embedded views along which events were passed. For instance, a mouse click would generate an event that would be passed to the object directly under the mouse pointer, say a button. If this object did not respond to the event, the object &quot;under&quot; the button would then receive the message, and so on. NeWS included a complete model for these events, including timers and other automatic events, input queues for devices such as mice and keyboards, and other functionality required for full interaction. The input handling system was designed to provide strong event synchronization guarantees that were not possible with asynchronous protocols like X.<p>From the OLPC mailing list, <a href=""http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/sugar-devel/2007-February/001613.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/sugar-devel/2007-February...</a><p>[sugar] Re: Zoomable tracking protocol for non-windowed Cairo based objects.<p>The ScriptX tracking service was based on The NeWS Toolkit 2.0&#x27;s tracking service (written in PostScript), which I adapted for ScriptX.  Credit for the design goes to Don Woods, Owen Densmore, Brian Raymor, and other people on the NeWS team, whose goal was to redesign the old NeWS tracking service and toolkit to be smaller and faster.<p>TNT 2.0 tried to minimize the number of objects, inter-object sends, event manager threads, coordinate transformations, share event interests (patterns to receive events), and centralize event processing in the global event manager.<p>It also had &quot;safe&quot; input handling, because NeWS threads (like the global event manager) could use synchronous event handlers (when appropriate, but not always), which were guaranteed to block the input queue and run the event handler before any more events were delivered. Synchronous event handlers enabled the window manager to perfectly track and synchronize mouse clicks, input focus and key distribution changes, without losing any events that slip between the cracks from changes in the window hierarchy, event handler registrations, and delays due to paging and network response. Safe input handling is especially important for slow networked computers (like a diskless Sun 3/50 or an OLPC) that need to respond quickly and reliably to user input!<p>Here is James Gosling&#x27;s original paper about what was eventually called NeWS: SunDew - A Distributed and Extensible Window System, from Methodology of Window Management (extremely interesting and required reading for anyone interested in window management and the history of user interface management system architecture): <a href=""http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/inf/literature/books/wm/p005.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/inf/literature/books/wm/...</a><p>This idea has very powerful implications within the context of window systems: it provides a graceful way to make the system much more flexible, and it provides some interesting solutions to performance and synchronization problems. SunDew contains a complete implementation of PostScript. The messages that client programs send to SunDew are really PostScript programs. [...]<p>5.3.3 User Interaction - Input<p>The key word in the design of the user interaction facilities is flexibility. Almost anything done by the window system preempts a decision about user interaction that a client might want to decide differently. The window system therefore defines almost nothing concrete. It is just a loose collection of facilities bound together by the extension mechanism.<p>Each possible input action is an event. Events are a general notion that includes buttons going up and down (where buttons can be on keyboards, mice, tablets, or whatever else) and locator motion.<p>Events are distinguished by where they occur, what happened, and to what. The objects spoken about here are physical, they are the things that a person can manipulate. An example of an event is the E key going down while window 3 is current. This might trigger the transmission of the ASCII code for E to the process that created the window. These bindings between events and actions are very loose, they are easy to change.<p>The actions to be executed when an event occurs can be specified in a general way, via PostScript. The triggering of an action by the striking of the E key in the previous example invokes a PostScript routine which is responsible for deciding what to do with it. It can do something as simple as sending it in a message to a Unix process, or as complicated as inserting it into a locally maintained document. PostScript procedures control much more than just the interpretation of keystrokes: they can be involved in cursor tracking, constructing the borders around windows, doing window layout, and implementing menus.<p>Synchronization of input events: we believe that it is necessary to synchronize input events within a user process, and to a certain extent across user processes. For example, the user ought to be able to invoke an operation that causes a window on top to disappear, then begin typing, and be confident about the identity of the recipient of the keystrokes. By having a centralized arbitration point, many of these problems disappear. [...]<p>Hopgood [Bob Hopgood, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]:
How do you handle input?<p>Gosling [James Gosling, CMU (Andrew, X10), Sun (SunDew/NeWS, Java)]:
Input is also handled completely within PostScript. There are data objects which can provide you with connections to the input devices and what comes along are streams of events and these events can be sent to PostScript processes. A PostScript process can register its interest in an event and specify which canvas (a data object on which a client can draw) and what the region within the canvas is (and that region is specified by a path which is one of these arbitrarily curve-bounded regions) so you can grab events that just cover one circle, for example. In the registration of interest is the event that you are interested in and also a magic tag which is passed in and not interpreted by PostScript, but can be used by the application that handles the event. So you can have processes all over the place handling input events for different windows. There are strong synchronization guarantees for the delivery of events even among multiple processes. There is nothing at all specified about what the protocol is that the client program sees. The idea being that these PostScript processes are responsible for providing whatever the application wants to see. So one set of protocol conversion procedures that you can provide are ones that simply emulate the keyboard and all you will ever get is keyboard events and you will never see the mouse. Quite often mouse events can be handled within PostScript processes for things like moving a window. [...]<p>Teitelman [Warren Teitelman, Xerox PARC (Smalltalk, DLisp (Interlisp), Interlisp-D, Tajo (Mesa Development Environment), Docs (Cedar), Viewers), Sun (SunView, SunDew/NeWS)]:
The innovation here is not that we are using PostScript. The reason we chose PostScript is due to a lot of historical connections and proximity to the people who are doing it.
The interesting thing is that all these processes look as though they are executing in one of those old single address environments. It is a single user process that James has been able to implement lightweight processes in. You don&#x27;t have lightweight processes in Unix systems, which you really need to implement realistic user interfaces.<p>Gosling:
There is really nothing new here. It&#x27;s just putting it together in a different way.<p>Rosenthal [David S. H. Rosenthal, CMU (Andrew, X10), Sun (one of the architects of NeWS, and developers of X10 and X11, who wrote the ICCCM)]:<p>It is worth bringing out a number of points about this style of window manager. There are some real limitations, though I think this is the way we should go.<p>Some help from the kernel is needed. This is easy in 4.2 which has a sensible IPC. It could be done in System V through shared resources etc.<p>A reliable signal mechanism is essential. The window manager has to stay up. It is the only routine for talking to the system and hence must stay alive. We have 100 systems running and only experience 1 - 2 crashes per week. This is good by Unix standards!<p>Applications cannot read pixels back - this is just too slow.<p>There must be a way to make the client think it has a real terminal, such as the 4.2BSD PTY device, otherwise all old programs misbehave.<p>There must be a mechanism for downloading application code into the window manager process, for example, rubber band line mouse tracking is done by a user level process.
There must be off-screen space in the window manager.<p>Examples of systems built in this way are:<p>BLIT [50];<p>Andrew (CMU)(see Chapter 13);<p>VGTS (Stanford) [36];<p>X (MIT).<p>The BLIT system is successful - people wrote programs for it. I believe it is the only successful window manager for a Unix system.<p>Myers [Brad Myers, University of Toronto (Peridot), CMU (Garnet, Amulet)]:
Maybe that is because BLIT doesn&#x27;t run a Unix operating system.<p>Rosenthal:
Overall, it is a Unix software environment.<p>Williams [Tony Williams, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]:
We should bear in mind that Rob Pike says that to do anything sensible using the BLIT, you need to write two processes which communicate: one running in the Unix host and one running in the BUT, and this must be harder to do than, say, writing two programs which don&#x27;t communicate.",1370704980

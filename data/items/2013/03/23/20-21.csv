The Space mission is part of may experiments on exploring the universe. The experiments conducted on the exploration of the universe lead to some results that have impact on earth. Those with impact on earth might lead to tangible innovation. These innovation might make it into definitive products. The products are measurable my monetary dimensions.<p>Yeah sure, with enough dedication you can measure anything and everything.

Even a service like Reader was something that only a small number of people used (compared to e.g. gMail).<p>One way to look at it is that these services are now <i>validated</i> (if small) market needs that smaller entrepreneurs can pursue.

The rather simple linked page needs a total of 3 AJAX requests, one for each template. As your app (especially mobile apps) needs more templates, it probably won't be very performant.

5429739,comment,5428979,5429575,6,0,greyman,,,"Exactly! In case of news stories, taking the headline and lede technically seems like a quoting, but in reality it is grabbing the substantial part of the original work. Moreover, when a journalist works on a story, he needs to compile much more information and interview much more sources that finally will appear in the news story, so there is much more hidden work, which the scraper don't need to do.<p>I personally applaud this decision, and I am also a bit surprised that EFF would support the scrappers.<p>I also like this quote and think the Judge is exactly right: ""Judge Cote rejected the fair use claim in large part because she didnt buy Meltwaters claim that its a search engine that makes transformative use of the APs content.

5429735,comment,5427985,5429707,3,0,derefr,,,"Chequing accounts (non-interest-bearing accounts, used primarily for their other conveniences) are an instance of a bank providing a (traditionally) not-bank service.<p>Basically, chequing accounts (and all their features: cheques, wire transfers, EFTs, cross-bank ATM withdrawal, etc.) are forms of <i>remittance</i>: a service where a group of people get together and agree to maintain an 'eventually-consistent' balance-sheet between them. Alice goes to one member branch of the remittance group and gives them $N (plus a transfer fee $F) to send to Bob, who may be anywhere else. Bob goes to a <i>different</i> member branch and gets his $N. $N is transferred from the pool to the branch Bob went to to cover their loss, and then $F is split between the group.<p>Remittance has never really been a function you would expect a ""bank"" to provide until quite modern times; banks tended to be single-branch, holding the deposits of the people who put them in <i>that bank</i>. You could get someone else's deposits from a bank if they had them turned into a <i>bank note</i> and gave that note to you, but to withdraw it, you'd have to go to <i>that bank</i>. (Greenbacks--<i>federal bank-notes</i>--were a clear innovation from this system. Imagine, a system so bad for holding and transferring value that ""cash"" is an improvement!)<p>When a <i>bank</i> temporarily ran out money to cover its outstanding liabilities (withdrawals), it didn't ask to be paid from some pool--it just took out a loan with a neighboring bank. (This still happens, and it's the basis of one of the very important numbers in Macroeconomics: LIBOR--the London Inter-Bank Exchange Rate, which measures the average interest banks will ask for when giving out those bank-to-bank loans, and which is built into the base of pretty much any other loan interest rate you might look at.)<p>Eventually, though, wire transfers plugged banks directly into one-another's balance sheets in a way they weren't before, and banks could suddenly outcompete all the traditional remittance providers because, unlike the remittance providers, they already had pretty much the whole population of each city/town they served as members. It's like Google suddenly realizing they could do ads when they already had so many eyeballs specifically looking for things to purchase online: it went from ""fun idea"" to ""main money-maker"" in the span of a few years.<p>But that still doesn't mean that that's what it means to be a bank, or that Bitcoin ""banks"" make any sense. Bitcoin <i>remittance providers</i>, sure--but nobody ever figured it was a good idea to keep their savings with a remittance provider ;)",1364072041

5429721,comment,5428922,5429310,6,0,vacri,,,"The big one that hasn't been mentioned yet is package management. It's a killer feature, especially if your job requires any form of tweaking. Working on windows, you have to search the internet for tool X, then figure out if you can afford it, or if it's free if there's an official page linking to a trustworthy download service, then once you install it, almost every one of these has it's own 'phone-home' mechanism to see if there's updates for it to who knows what websites.<p>In a package-managed system, you don't have to open a browser to starting hunting on the internet. You can search your own repository. Install it in literally seconds - particularly if you already know the name. There's only one program doing the 'phone home' - your package manager, and that only does it to sites that you can confirm with your own two eyes.<p>I run a windows desktop at home, but only for the games. Working with windows for work would be like tying one hand behind my back - windows makes it harder to 'get at' the system. But it really depends on what your specific tools are, there are analogues for most in the linux world if you ask around.<p>And licensing, oh my god, licensing. The nail in the Windows coffin for me was licensing (the joy of package management came later). ""Hi Windows Support, I have this remote server that's going to expire its CALs in two days. I have applied the license code in a couple of different ways and it refuses to 'take' and demands a phone call to you guys. I can't get at this server physically. Okay, thank you for the code, I've applied it. Now, can you tell me <i>where</i> I can see that it has been successfully applied? Because the license box just disappeared when I clicked 'ok', there was no confirmation. This is a box in a country hospital, people's health actually depend on it - so please, I need it to remain remotely accessible - where can I actually see on the system it saying 'it is now licensed'?"" ==> ""Oh don't worry sir, that information is stored on our systems"". It's not the Microsoft Police that I'm worried about here ==> ""Oh don't worry, sir, that information is stored on our systems""<p>Licensing shennanigans drove me from being fearful of that crazy weird linux thing that doesn't make sense, and since then I've come to love it for all its advantages over windows. Linux has its warts, but every time I run into a problem like a dependency issue, which really isn't often these days, I remember the method of hunting Windows software on the internet, and it's much easier to deal with.<p>EDIT: also with package management, it's trivial to set up a new system with all the bits and bobs you want (awesome for testing stuff). You can do this with windows, but it's an ordeal getting it set up automatically - the usual process of installing in windows is manually going through each thing you want installed and every one of it's click-through windows.",1364071772

We've developed a culture over the last two decades of launching compelling new services without a clear revenue model in a land-grab for users.  Many software frameworks utilize lazy loading, whereby they defer the execution of expensive operations until the last possible minute.  Our business culture lazy-loads revenue models.  We set up a product, hope for enough users, then hope to monetize those users effectively.  Without a compelling product or an audience to consume it, a business model is useless, so we've optimized that out to focus on the bare minimum.<p>There's an implicit assumption in all of this that the perceived value of a free service outweighs the potential costs of the service eventually failing in the user's eyes, that they'll keep coming back for something free and cool every time we ship it.  As an industry, we haven't addressed the risk of crying wolf.  At what point do enough consumers say ""I'm going to wait until this has traction"" before they're willing to invest their time and their hearts into the services we build?  If the wait-and-see crowd grows large enough, it could seriously impact our ability to launch minimum-viable-products on the hope they'll monetize later.",1364071678

Money kept in a wallet (or under a mattress) steadily loses value because of inflation. A bank counteracts this by loaning out the money we give it (earning <i>it</i> money on interest), and then paying us another, smaller interest rate for our deposits in turn, which will offset inflation to whatever degree. Other entities also do this--mutual funds, for example--but banks do it while also making our money still somewhat convenient to re-liquidate and transfer; others may require, for example, 30 days' notice to facilitate withdrawal.<p>One thing that's very interesting about Bitcoin is that, once it's all mined out, there won't <i>be</i> any inflation (or deflation) of its supply--the amount of Bitcoin out in the world will become effectively fixed. This means that, by and large, ""banks"" (in the ""savings bank"" sense; investment banks are a separate beast) are pretty irrelevant to a Bitcoin-based economy: there's no need to protect the value of your money; it's <i>stable</i> just sitting in a wallet.<p>This property of Bitcoin might do strange things to the global economy if Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted. In effect, it would be a global version of what some Eurozone countries have experienced, where they have control over their fiscal policy (taxes and spending), but no control over their monetary policy (ability to print money.) It's common wisdom in Economics that at least a little bit of inflation is good--otherwise people tend to hoard money instead of investing it ventures that improve GDP. In a wholly-Bitcoin economy, there's no particular <i>fear-based</i> incentive to invest over just sitting on your money. (There's still a greed-based incentive to invest with banks for increased risk = increased reward in good economic times, but in times of economic volatility, the ""flight to quality"" toward stable Bitcoins would be absolute, moreso than treasury bills or gold have ever been.)",1364070638

Sure, it was worth mentioning early in the game (and more importantly once), but at this point it's become a bandwagon.<p>The press is declaring Google Reader a sign of things to come, but for the average user this has little effect. If we assume Google wasn't lying, and the users were dropping off, it makes sense for them to cut off a product that wasn't being actively developed in the first place. I'm a Reader fan, and I hate that it shut down, but that's beside the point - Google is trying to build new, better products, not let old ones fester without support or development.<p>This doesn't even tackle the fact that Keep isn't a true Evernote competitor.

That's an initial turn off for many hardcore fans of the genre.<p>I can't speak for Ultron because the demo (not available on Steam) won't run on Windows 8, but last time I tried Droid Assault, it took a while to pick up in difficulty. I didn't encounter much challenge until near the end of the (rather long) demo.<p>Droid Assault was also pretty easy to exploit; the first few boss enemies won't chase you off screen, so it was possible to pop in and out of hiding, firing off a few shots at a time. This makes for boring gameplay, but the game didn't discourage it.<p>The games don't seem to be aimed at hardcore gamers, and they're not popular with casual gamers.

I later found a 3rd party shell extension to fix it, but it was ugly as hell and kept breaking after each version bump. So I gave up. Besides, I do not want to rely on 3rd party extensions for core functionality, like switching between applications.<p>There is a 2nd reason why their dynamic workspaces cannot be used as a replacement for proper virtual desktops: the desktop numbers (index) keep changing: if I have desktops #1, #2 and #3 (and I use shortcuts for them, like Win+1, Win+2, etc), and I close the last window in desktop #2, Gnome3 immediately kills #3 and moves all its windows to #2.

I really like the sql identifier escaping, where most just do literals.<p>I&#x27;d thought about:<p>&quot;select * from %I${my_table} where ...&quot;<p>I think I&#x27;d probably feel more comfortable having a whitelist of allowed words rather than just a blacklist, as there are probably ways around it.  Either new syntaxes in future Postgres versions, or mid-sql comments.  Take this for example:<p><i>Edit</i>: sorry the * before the word &quot;comment&quot; below is being escaped by hacker news.  There is probably some hackernews-injection to get around this:}<p>select/<i>comment</i>/ * from foo;<p>if &quot;select/<i>comment</i>/&quot; was the identifier, that&#x27;s valid sql, but:<p>function isReserved(value) {

The reality of his future weighs upon me.  He is still young, only 6, and I love him dearly (both of them).  He is a happy child, affectionate (a rarity for autistics), loving.  I dread the day we cannot properly care for him.  The reality of his situation, of what his life will be once he gets older haunts me.  I fear that life will eventually take that happiness from him, and he will not understand why.  He stims, and recently it has started to cause bruising.  Not much, and not frequently, but enough that I worry.<p>I don&#x27;t know what will happen when he grows up.  I just hope that he will keep smiling, keep being happy.  If I can help him keep that, that&#x27;s all that will matter.",1423490265

9020953,comment,9019892,9019892,0,0,erikb,,,"After reading the comments I found a few ideas that were not represented, so I write them here:<p>1. Git thinks around a commit, Gitless thinks around a file. Comparing two tools on a different basis might result in a flawed comparison. The reason that git uses for considering commits over single files is as far as I know, that you as a developer consider consistent states of your project. Before and after a change a project should be able to build, for instance. Often these changes can not happen in a single file and still be consistent. Therefore a project state is considered a unit, not a set of files that are changed on their own.<p>2. The staging area. Gitless thinks the staging area is a problem so it seems to be removed (might be a wrong interpretation by me). The staging area is quite important though. Sometimes I have made many changes, but I don&#x27;t want all of them in one commit. In another scenario I did many changes that after squashing plus a few edits here and there might be better represented by a much smaller amount of commits. In both cases I need a space that is not the repository space of completed commits nor the workspace to represent a commit in its creation. The staging area might not be the best way to do it (I don&#x27;t know a better one, though), but completely removing it without an alternative does not solve the problem.",1423487473

The UK ended up selling licenses to private companies to handle this themselves.<p>As a result of this Norway now has the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world. It&#x27;s pretty hard to make direct comparisons given the differences in their populations and economies, but a fairly broad range (i.e. left <i>and</i> right [1][2][3][4]) of people seem to think that this was a wasted opportunity and that if it was managed better they&#x27;d have a lot more to show for the last 3 1/2 decades.

Do you know what the punitive interest rates are in these cases?<p>HMRC say that [0]:<p><pre><code>    &quot;Those who try to get an unfair advantage will have to pay:

    - any tax that is due
    - any interest that is due
    - any penalties that are due&quot;

I can&#x27;t find any information about the the penalties that have been handed out in real terms. There&#x27;s potentially more to be gained by holding on to the cash and using to your advantage until you get found out (if you ever do).<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a reasonable way for HMRC to do things but it&#x27;s a bit weird that you can knowingly be in the wrong without having the risk of jail time hanging over you.<p>[0] <a href=""http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/new-penalties/faqs.htm#2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.hmrc....</a>",1423487067

9020921,comment,9014795,9018155,0,0,atmosx,,,"Hello Mark,<p>I don&#x27;t know if the Latvians went through a similar situation in 2009, but Greece is in this situation for 6 years and no one feels that it&#x27;s going to end anytime soon. Indeed large part of the population[1] is semi-depressed on a daily basis.<p>There&#x27;s another part that&#x27;s important to mention here: Greeks have been heavily accused of being lazy and corrupted. Of course there are lazy on corrupted people in Greece. But the majority is not like that. Indeed, I dare to say that Greeks are among the most hard-working people in Europe. No one I know works the pre-determined hours. EVERYONE works overtime, me too of course. This accusation led to a feeling of <i>lost dignity</i> which now SYRIZA is trying to restore.<p>Most Greeks don&#x27;t even know when that happened, but I know... It was first the &#x27;Karamanlis&#x27; government who initiated the <i>myth</i> of Greeks not paying taxes and then Papandreou went over the roof making rounds in Europe stating that he is the PM of a <i>corrupted country</i> in order to avoid all responsibility for non-taxing the local oligarchy.<p>In a sense, Greeks, deserved to be <i>punished</i> because we supported (as a nation) largely corrupted politicians. It&#x27;s easy to blame, it&#x27;s a lot more complicated in real life, but I won&#x27;t bother you with details. Truth is that there are no innocents.<p>However, we found ourselves in a spiral of a Crisis that we didn&#x27;t create, private banks did. I feel that Greece was the weakest link.<p>In 6 years of austerity, Greece has implemented so many reforms that no other <i>first world</i> country had ever made. It create a (I believe false, but whatever) surplus last year, but at a huge financial and social cost. The troika&#x27;s program, led the debt (which in theory everyone wants to lower) go from 125% to 180% of the GDP. Clearly, it doesn&#x27;t work for us.<p>From the amount received by the troika, only 11% went to Greece. The rest went to pay Greek maturing bonds held by French and German banks. Doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. At the same time, Germany was selling broken submarines in Greece and military equipment. Indeed the only part of the public spending that wasn&#x27;t slashed was the military spending. I assume that is because most of our military expenditures came from Germany and France.<p>In 2001, Greece falsified the countries stats to enter the EURO. Everyone knew. Personally I believe that many other countries did the same (Italy, Portugal and probably others). What is known now, is that everyone knew but didn&#x27;t care at the time. The man who made this possible was Loukas Papademos. He acted as a bridge between Goldman Sachs and the Greek government. Loukas Papademos was A. Merkel&#x27;s choice for PM after Papandreou resigned and country for some reason wasn&#x27;t <i>ready</i> for elections. Isn&#x27;t that a strange choice to make? It looks very suspicious to me to choose to <i>work</i> with the same people who accuse of fraud. Mostly in the same vein, Germany supported the same parties that brought Greece, financially speaking, to it&#x27;s knees... Which doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.<p>The current government is the first <i>clean</i> government in 40 years. It might our last chance to straight up the country.<p>> I&#x27;m genuinely interested in how you would ideally see Greece regain solvability.<p>I like Varoufakis (our new FinMin) &quot;Modest Proposal&quot;[2]. Varoufakis believes that, although Greece has it&#x27;s fair share of problems as is, the Eurozone crisis is mostly structural. It&#x27;s not a Greek problem, it&#x27;s a European problem. Many renowned economists have expressed the same idea. You might be familiar with Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz for example, two American economy nobel-winners, but there are many others which believe so in mainstream financial media magazines like the NYTimes, FT, WSJ, The Economist, etc.<p>That said, I believe that the Greek economy is a symptom. Greece has a total lack of justice estate. If the current government manages to re-structure our justice estate in order for it to break the chains of corruption, the rest will follow.<p>Sorry for the long response!<p>Take care :-)<p>[1] I live in a small town in North Greece. The crisis didn&#x27;t strike our town as much as other major Greek cities. I work with people, elderly mostly and I get a first-hand idea of how they feel.<p>[2] <a href=""http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/euro-crisis/modest-proposal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/euro-crisis/modest-proposal/</a>",1423487032

Explanation here:<p><a href=""http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2587.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2587.html</a><p>Cash is not king in financial markets. Risk is. The government bailed out major banks by assuming the downside risk of major banks when those risks were very large, for minimal compensation. In particular, the government 1) offered regulatory forbearance and tolerated generous valuations; 2) lent to financial institutions at or near risk-free interest rates against sketchy collateral (directly or via guarantee); 3) purchased preferred shares at modest dividend rates under TARP; 4) publicly certified the banks with stress tests and stated “no new Lehmans”. By these actions, the state assumed substantially all of the downside risk of the banking system. The market value of this risk-assumption by the government was more than the entire value of the major banks to their “private shareholders”. On commercial terms, the government paid for and ought to have owned several large banks lock, stock, and barrel. Instead, officials carefully engineered deals to avoid ownership and control.<p>...<p>After assuming the banking system’s downside risk, the US government engineered a wide variety of favorable circumstances that helped banks “earn” their way back to quasi-health. The government provided famous and obvious transfers like unwinding AIG swaps at 100¢ on the dollar. It forced short-term yields to zero and created an environment in which medium-term interest rates would be capped for several years, granting banks a near-risk-free arbitrage for a while. It emitted trillions in excess reserves on which it continues to pay interest. It forewent investigations and prosecutions that by law it should actively pursue, and settled what enforcement it could not avoid for token fees. Then there are the things conspiracy theorists and cranks like me suspect but cannot prove: that the government and the Fed have been less than aggressive in minimizing their costs when they or entities they control (AIG, Fannie, Freddie) transact with large banks, that they have left money on the table where doing so could be hidden in arcane accounts or justified as ordinary transaction expenses and trading losses. Large banks have enjoyed some rather extraordinary results for allegedly efficient markets, quarters with large trading profits and no or very few losing days. Government housing policy is pretty overtly subject to a constraint that interventions must not provoke loss realizations for banks carrying bad loans at inflated values, or interfere with servicing revenues. (If you think I am overconspiratorial, I’m still waiting for an innocent explanation of this, from 1991.)",1423486830

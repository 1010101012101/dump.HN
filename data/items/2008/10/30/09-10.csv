It also focuses on the failures of ex-CEO Terry Semel, not Jerry Yang's current predicament.<p>Closing argument for the lazy: ""At Yahoo, the marketers rule, and at Google the engineers rule. And for that, Yahoo is finally paying the price.""",1225358981

We forged ahead (Were doing this regardless if we are a part of YC or not), started prototyping, networking, and solidified our business vision and plan.<p>We applied again this cycle and got accepted for an interview.  Our YC application has changed a bit since we now have a much more focused direction, but our technology stack has been pretty much the same from day one.<p>I hope that this can be an encouragement to those of you who didn't get it this time, but I'm sure that if you try again you can only increase your chances.  BTW, last time we applied we did it fairly last minute and I missed an email from pg asking us some questions.  This time, we applied a month in advance and I checked my YC mail daily so I wouldn't make that mistake again.  And yes, he did email us some questions again but this time I replied on time.  =).",1225358107

171863,comment,171818,171850,0,0,jamess,,,"Only in the sense of ""metadata you get for free.""<p>It's perfectly reasonable for, say, a CMS to semantically mark up when an article was posted. That's free. The server knows the date, so why not? It's not hurting anyone. Similarly, a camera with a GPS chip could easily add LAT/LONG EXIF metadata to every photo, except for the power, that's free too. You could use that to answer queries like ""give me all photos taken in Laos in the past year"", for example. Nothing wrong with that.<p>Where it breaks down is that there isn't enough free metadata to make the semantic web worthwhile. It relies on people actually saying ""This is an address I'm typing right now... this is the street component of the address... This is the City..."" It's ridiculous. Certainly, there'll be special purpose applications making use of free metadata in the future, but the whole web being semantic will never happen.",1208983361

I'd say that Eric Raymond, David Heinemeier Hansson, Paul Graham, Joel Spolsky, Kathy Sierra, and Linus Torvalds are ""public intellectuals"" within this space.  Many of these folks have impressive tech accomplishments, but people know who they are largely because they've read their writings/essays about software (ie., I'm distinguishing people who are known purely on the basis of code).

There are ways that microformats or semantic data could easily start showing up in websites. If a web framework, like say Rails, supported microformat creation based on your models then it wouldn't cost the developer or user any more time to markup that data. All of a sudden your movie app starts automatically inserting semantic movie info about the actors, director, etc which can link back to authoritative sources.<p>I'm not saying that it WILL happen, but I think it is definitely doable. With a framework like Rails your schema is already available to the program. If we just had one more generator (or more likely a gem for each supported microformat) then you could get semantic data in your app for almost free.",1208983115

171846,comment,171463,171791,0,0,apgwoz,,,"Let me be perfectly clear. I have not investigated the code of Chyrp, primarily because I was turned off right away by a) the number of queries made, b) unsalted-hashed password in cookies (not that salted-hashed password in cookies is any better) and c) the fact that I dislike PHP. I should also mention, that I'm NOT an advocate of WordPress either.<p>I didn't say that there's an is_admin thing, just that the password is stored in a cookie, seemingly for the purposes of authentication. Storing a hashed password like that is probably a bad idea, and perhaps even worse is storing the associated user id with it. Logging into the demo and looking at my cookies shows both of these things. This does nothing to prevent session hijacking, at all. In fact it doesn't even make an attempt.<p>In regards to queries, I should point out this screenshot taken a few minutes ago: <a href=""http://apgwoz.com/images/chyrp-85.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apgwoz.com/images/chyrp-85.png</a> in which you'll notice, 85 queries, a bit worse than the 55 I saw before. It was probably my mistake for linking to the homepage, which shows 18 queries, rather than an inner page with other content. I apologize for that lack in judgement.<p>As for wanting the software to improve, you're right--I don't care. It's not solving a problem that hasn't been solved many times before, and aside from looking pretty I don't really see the need for a new blog platform. Just my 2 cents.

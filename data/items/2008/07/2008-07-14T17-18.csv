Program in whatever you want: Flex, FlashDevelop, Eclipse + FDT plugin etc, but you still want your symbols in the library to be able to be accessed and updated/edited easily.<p>Flash developers know quite a few tricks to get stuff to act as intended, so I would highly recommend a book on flash game design. I read one a few years back and it helped a lot with the intricacies.",1216058243

Operating systems used to require consultants and were priced for enterprises, until Windows came along and completely changed the market.<p>There's lot of instances where a dramatic cut in price opened a new market for products, and it sure seems like this is the case here.<p>I also find the whole ""site licensing"" of PDFs (which obviously means DRM) kind of obnoxious.<p>Finally I find that the useit.com approach of putting up short parts of reports, followed by a link to the paid report, to be borderline sleazy.<p>Perhaps I'm influenced by the ""free"" culture that is so pervasive these days.",1216058035

I am a very vocal proponent of democracies and a critic of how China treats not only its citizens, but journalists both native and foreign and how it uses its economic might to get away with things that other country get sanctioned for.<p>Tiananmen Square was less than 20 years ago and not that much has changed, I feel.",1216057865

245871,comment,245639,245665,0,0,riahi,,,"The comparison between the iPhone UI and Windows Mobile UI is the crux of the matter.  With a device that you use dozens of times a day, every single day, the UI better be damn good.  As of now, the UI on mobile devices has <i>not</i> been good.  I've had a Dell Axim x51v running Windows Mobile 5 and 6, and let me tell you, this pda would crash at least once a day due to memory leaks or other gibberish.  I shudder to think what the phone versions of Windows Mobile are like, since just the PDA was so unstable.<p>This also reminds me of the people trying to rid Verizon phones from their horrific UI and replace it with the UI that originally comes on the phones.  Just because VZW-UI and Motorola-UI phones are equally functional, does not mean the UI does not matter.",1216057388

This should make ""expired link"" messages less common, because the supply of closure ids won't run out so fast.<p>The new code is gross, as I feared it would be.
In other applications you might be able to postpone this compromise.  The big problem for News.YC turned out to be crawlers.  They burn up closure ids as fast as real users, but the traffic you get from them is a function of the total size of your site.<p>We also made a few optimizations, so the site should be a bit faster.",1216057227

They just aren&#x27;t the giants that we all remember.<p>I think that is a digression, though.  As is the concern of &quot;we all read on ____&quot;.  Because, first off, we don&#x27;t.  Quite a lot of us still read RSS feeds.  I don&#x27;t think many RSS feeds disappeared, just a big tool to read them.<p>What far fewer of us do, is talk about the things we read on RSS, because it is not an inherently social tool.  Consider, if I find a neat article in an rss feed, the only way I can talk about it with my peers is to post it on facebook/g+/twitter.<p>Which is what Google Reader actually managed to bring to the table for RSS.  I could share stories and have conversations in my peer groups.  This actually even worked with Google Buzz.  It was surprisingly nice.<p>The problem there, I think, is all of these conversations happened with no real intrusion from ads.  Google had no real way to put &quot;sponsored&quot; stories into my rss feeds without it being glaringly obvious.

7398706,comment,7397637,7398240,1,0,vertex-four,,,"Actually, there&#x27;s a couple of up-and-coming node.js frameworks which do encourage using much of the same code on client and server. Some of the ReactJS stacks do, for example.<p>The thing is, it turns out that what people want is proper separation of frontend and backend, not separation of client and server. Outside of single-page apps, there&#x27;s a fair bit of &quot;generate this page for me&quot; stuff required as a baseline, but also a lot of places where if it&#x27;s possible, rendering (and animating) on the client-side provides a better experience. GitHub&#x27;s repository browsing is an example, as is Twitter&#x27;s entire site, as is Google&#x27;s Instant Search.<p>So running the same view logic on the server and client is a good thing, as it results in not having to write it once for each environment. The controller glue for tying it to the model changes, but that can easily be switched out per environment without changing the view&#x27;s code, and is often generic enough that it can be implemented at least in part by a library.",1394805462

There are certainly some outliers (e.g. terrorism), but overall, traffic deaths seem to get more attention given its death rate than other causes of death.<p>For example, annual traffic deaths in the US are about the same as annual deaths from chronic liver disease or suicide. Suicide gets some attention, liver disease very little, while traffic deaths get all sorts of attention, from massive R&D efforts by car makers to seat belt campaigns to heavy police enforcement of safety-related traffic laws.<p>As another example, heart disease and stroke kill about 20 times as many Americans as traffic accidents, but it&#x27;s legal for me to eat 6,000 calories of bacon a day while it&#x27;s illegal for me not to wear my seat belt.

My take is this: If you want to auto-detect the language, fine... but let the owner of the repo override your detection when it&#x27;s wrong.<p>It&#x27;s probably also a bug to even have the notion of &quot;a language&quot; for a repo given the burgeoning polyglot programming trend.

Turnover has tremendous immediate and long-term impact on the bottom line. I guess the hope is that upper management will swoop in, fire the crappy manager, contact out all the about to leave/left employees and put them back in their jobs.<p>But it never seems to work that way. I think it&#x27;s more a fear that if you bring them back, it gives the inmates a reason to revolt rather than the signal getting lost somewhere.<p>My wife went through a similar situation with a manager two levels above her. And this guy was easily among the worst managers I&#x27;ve ever even heard of -- case study worthy material, the textbook definition of a Machiavellian management style (it&#x27;s funny that he also runs a management consulting business on the side). Within months of him being put in place the company shed about 40% of their staff under him, including people who had been there more than a decade.<p>While all this was going down, <i>his</i> manager would come down and talk to the malcontent and implore them to not leave. But the condition was clear, get rid of the asshole or they&#x27;d have no choice. As it turns out a few months later they <i>did</i> eventually fire him, but the damage had already been done and not a single former employee was contacted with a &quot;hey sorry about all that, we fixed things, would you think about coming back?&quot; From conversations with those that left, most of them <i>would</i> in fact return.<p>In the interim, they&#x27;ve lost tens of millions of dollars on failed projects, outside consultants to try and fill in the gap, and other related issues.<p>From the employee level it seems bizarre, but the only rational explanation I can think of is that they&#x27;re afraid of bringing people back and thereby granting them too much power. Somewhere in management training, the seniors probably learned that &quot;officers don&#x27;t show weakness in front of the men&quot; and have been holding to that at all cost.",1394804794

It would be like flipping a coin and seeing heads, then claiming that this outcome increases the probability that heads will be the preferred outcome in future tosses, or tosses in general. Think about what you&#x27;re saying.&quot;</i><p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.  If you flip <i>enough</i> straight heads, at some point you decide there&#x27;s something going on with the coin - even if you&#x27;re not sure what.<p><i>&quot;Without an explanation, it&#x27;s a coincidence.&quot;</i><p>If a coincidence is sufficiently unlikely, the chance that it&#x27;s not simply a coincidence becomes more likely.  Just because I don&#x27;t <i>know</i> what&#x27;s stripping entropy from the system doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t conclude that <i>something</i> almost certainly is.  Let&#x27;s say that you and I set up an experiment where we flip coins together - each 1000 flips - and we compare our flips.  We find that we&#x27;ve both flipped a lot of heads and a lot of tails, but with no particular observable pattern - except that we both got the same sequence.  1000 flips, and the two coins matched <i>every time</i>.<p>You don&#x27;t immediately have an explanation (do you?), but you&#x27;d set about looking for one right?  Why would it be crazy to start looking for some interaction between the coins before observing those 1000 flips, and make sense after?  Because the existence of <i>some</i> causal relationship just became 1000 bits more likely.<p><i>&quot;Try to remember that science is not simply drawing conclusions on the basis of observations -- there&#x27;s more to it than that. It&#x27;s not science until an explanation (a theory) is proposed, is tested, and has resisted falsification.&quot;</i><p>You keep going back to this, but my goal isn&#x27;t &quot;TO DO SCIENCE&quot;, it&#x27;s to draw correct conclusions about the world so that I can make my way around it.

If not, then I don&#x27;t have use for <i>your</i> &quot;Science&quot; - or at least I have a lot of use for things that are <i>not</i> Science and your condemnation of them for simply &quot;not being science&quot; is misleading and harmful and silly.<p><i>&quot;What if I told you that someone correctly predicted the direction of the stock market for 20 months straight, all in advance? Does that prove he&#x27;s a stock market genius? Here&#x27;s a better explanation, one that a scientist would want to test first -- if 1,048,576 (i.e. 2^20) people try to predict the stock market&#x27;s direction for 20 months straight by flipping coins, there is a better than even chance that one of them will succeed by chance alone.&quot;</i><p>No it doesn&#x27;t &quot;prove that he is a stock market genius&quot; - but it <i>is more likely</i> that he is a stock market genius when you&#x27;ve observed that then when you have not, because P(20 consecutive predictions | he is a genius) > P(20 consecutive predictions | he is not a genius), and that&#x27;s true regardless of how many people were picking.  Given the pool you&#x27;re drawing from, it <i>remains</i> spectacularly unlikely.  You keep insisting that my &quot;we end up thinking X is more likely than we started thinking it was&quot; means &quot;we think X is more likely than alternatives&quot; in order to draw absurd conclusions.  Of course that will give you absurd conclusions, it&#x27;s an absurd position - but it&#x27;s never been what I&#x27;ve said.<p><i>&quot;Next question -- what&#x27;s the chance that the one random winner will assume that his success resulted from chance, or will he start selling a worthless book called &quot;Secrets of the Winners&quot; on late-night TV?&quot;</i><p>Yes, the high probability of that and the low probability of actually being a &quot;stock market genius&quot; means those books are likely to be worthless.

This practice doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;<p>Before I started a startup, I was a software engineer at a large firm, and it was clear they were grooming me for management because I was a strong individual contributor and had &quot;put in my time&quot;: 3 years as an engineer. Advancement at this firm was measured by &quot;how many reports&quot; you had, as in &quot;direct reports&quot;, or people managed by you, and if you just did superior individual work but had no one &quot;under you&quot;, you weren&#x27;t advancing. So they sent me to a couple of training courses about management and started prepping me for the path.<p>This was one of the many reasons I quit this BigCo to start my own startup.<p>I am now the co-founder & CTO of Parse.ly (<a href=""http://parse.ly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parse.ly</a>). In our first two years after starting up, I spent all my time building stuff -- which is exactly what I wanted. Ironically, because the company has grown and now has a 13-person product team, I am now technically &quot;managing&quot; my engineering team with 13 &quot;direct reports&quot;. But at our company, we have completely decoupled management from individual contribution -- certainly, if a strong individual contributor shows an interest in management, we&#x27;ll consider it. But becoming a &quot;manager&quot; is not how you &quot;advance&quot; here -- you advance by doing great work. Our first employee who joined in 2009 is a great programmer and he is still with the company, but he&#x27;s still doing what he loves: building & shipping stuff. Based on our frank conversations on the topic, I think he would quit if I forced him to be a manager. The appropriate reward for doing great work isn&#x27;t a &quot;promotion to management&quot; -- that&#x27;s actually a <i>punishment</i> for a great individual contributor. The right reward is to ensure you continue to provide an environment where that great work can continue for that contributor, and where they can continue to grow their skills and apply themselves productively in the role.",1394804643

7398591,comment,7395644,7396272,1,0,freehunter,,,"I think the premise of the 20mph speed limit is good, but the way car transmissions are geared, doing a sustained slow speed could actually be dangerous as well. Doing 15mph through the parking lot at my office means I&#x27;m feathering the throttle quite a bit, and paying close attention to my speedometer and less attention to the things in front of me. I&#x27;ve never driven a car that &quot;wants&quot; to do 15mph or 20mph. I can&#x27;t just keep the throttle at one position and stay at 20mph, the pedal, the foot controlling it, and the sense of speed related by the brain just aren&#x27;t designed for fine adjustments.<p>The point being, I believe that setting low and strict speed limits could be counter productive and could lead to drivers being more distracted and less prepared to stop. If my hunch is right, there would be an increase in car-pedestrian accidents at exactly 20mph, and fewer at 10mph or below due to people being less likely to get their foot on the brake because of the effort required to keep the car moving at 20mph and watching the speedometer.<p>I&#x27;ve actually hit a pedestrian once. My light turned green as the person stepped into the crosswalk, and I hit them less than a second after I was stopped at 0mph. The pedestrian and the car were both fine with no injuries. Perhaps rather than dropping the city speed limit from the 25mph it already is down to 20mph, we should be focusing on getting pedestrians to cross in locations where cars are naturally going very slowly to begin with. I don&#x27;t want to shift the blame of an accident from the perpetrator to the victim, but for pedestrian safety, crossing at a light (and following crosswalk signals) is worlds safer because the cars there will already be either stopped or going very slowly.",1394804134

What Gallup has done is developed their own methodology to identify who will be effective managers, and their claim is that the managers that they identify as effective have a huge impact on performance.  But their identification has a fairly low correlation with what most in the organization perceive as who is effective.<p>If you re-read the blog keeping what I just said in mind, you will see that it fits.  And you will further see that your point is in complete agreement - the people who are perceived as having good management potential have a low correlation with actual performance.<p>The blog points out that this happens at the bottom level because people who are good at non-management tasks get promoted to management and may or may not be a fit.  But as you go up the latter you find that a lot of what tends to get rewarded is visible success.  Which gives an unfair edge to self-promoting narcissists who manage to make their occasional successes more visible than they should be.  The result being that perception and reality tend to diverge.",1394803619

I read pretty much everything Stafford Beer put up about the functioning of the system, but we never really saw a specification of the system dynamics-based model of the chilean economy it was supposed to be based on.<p>Now, if you&#x27;ve ever played with how a sys-dyn model is built... timing your delays is crucial. &quot;Real-time control&quot; is a super cool idea, but there are stochastic deferrals between actions by policy-makers or decentralized agents and their systemic consequences. Mis-time these and you&#x27;ll just be inducing cycles.<p>That&#x27;s a reason why modern economic planning is all based on watching response signals. We watch inflation and unemployment not because the relatively low thresholds that trigger action are catastrophic, but because inflation is a symptom of an overheated economy. We can&#x27;t track demand and supply at the level of every commodity, and if we did, we wouldn&#x27;t know how capacity expansion relates to effective availability to the consumer (this is a mistake countries that try to deal with hyperinflation with heavy intervention keep making, with the inevitable shortages in supply).<p>TL;DR: Zomg tech",1394802842

Our developers use an older rapid development environment, in which the front end tool stores its form layout, triggers, and source code all in the database.  It doesn&#x27;t provide an option to develop out of regular text files.  So there are a couple approaches I could take:<p>1) Use triggers so that every time a GIT command is run, it either imports or exports the given database table.  But this takes simple, fast operations and makes them expensive.<p>2) Write a Fuse plugin that can expose a database schema as a filesystem object, and have a git checkout trigger that mount it in the appropriate place.<p>Has anyone already done either of these two?",1394802758

It&#x27;d probably be better if they left their investments alone, and instead drew some money from their WL policy. You could argue that their allocation should&#x27;ve been well tilted from equities at that point, but what if it wasn&#x27;t?<p>In a perfect world of automatic 10% yearly returns, and diligent saving/investment, buying term and investing the difference (from WL) would smack the performance of WL.

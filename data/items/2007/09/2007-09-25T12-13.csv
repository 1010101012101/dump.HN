The early exit was probably somewhat disappointing relative to what could've been a huge late exit, but you can't be too sad doubling up that fast.<p>In other news, Facebook has $4million in cash to hire two people with??",1190724989

The first group of programmers didn't work out but the second one produced quality code. We then hired them and did weekly review checking out their code and testing it.<p>But it's true asking coders in other countries is not the cheap way out of getting a co-founder, who knows how to program, some people want it to be",1190724531

My point is that you can't pick an arbitrary amount ($58 Million) for the valuation - but that this amount is <i>always</i> dependent on other people.<p>The problem with your example is that we all have limited knowledge about any given business transaction.  Assuming ten people were standing around bidding on little rocks thinking they are diamonds, for that moment (to those people) they are worth $10k.  When they have more knowledge (i.e. that this is glass and not diamonds) then the worth of those rocks drops.  So the worth varies based on the knowledge in the market and valuations of others.<p>Now in any given market if one has more knowledge about a good or service one might be able to say that a good or service is over valued.  For instance, I have always believed Myspace to be over valued.  However, this realization does not give one the ability to pick a number out of the air and state that it is a <i>correct</i> valuation.

Sometimes I just need to get away from the computer screen.<p>I read Seth Godin's blog everyday, but I still bought Small Is the New Big. I still bought and read The Long Tail although half the book was online.

b) User retention
c) Monetisation<p>pg states makes something people want first, which covers a and b then figure out c. If you plan to charge for your product you have to consider which features people would pay for and not give them away for free initially as you will not be able to charge for them later.<p>If you don't want to charge directly - then focus on building the user base and you'll have an audience which you can figure out from what would keep them and let you monetise through advertising. Generally in consumer ad plays focus on reaching and keeping users first, as you'll be able to sell advertisers on that.",1190723713

2. as software folk, we are still learning about business, and its easier to walk first, and then run
3. we need the money now, we don't have valley funders to give us gobs of money in Milwaukee, WI.  I think the state tracked 3-5 million here last year in angel funding.
4. our evaluation will be higher with revenue and on the ground business knowledge.",1190723032

It's hard for me to believe that the difference between decent performance at Harvard and better performance at a slightly less selective school is worth the enormous up front cost of the former.unless your marginal utility of a dollar really low.<p>Another way to look at this is perhaps ""Rich families transfer wealth between the generations in a tax-advantaged, inefficient, socially acceptable way"" I went to a perfectly good college on academic scholarship (and therefore almost certainly could have gone somewhere better (well, more selective) not on scholarship) and my friends were going to UChicago and Yale for econ PhDs right out of undergrad, so I don't really feel slighted in terms of opportunity.<p>The big advantage as I see it would be being surrounded by really smart people all the time and sneaking something ridiculous to the top of the dome would do wonders for self confidence later in life.",1190722800

It's a way to help buy up all the slack in the emission market (by buying emissions permits) in Europe which has a regulatory cap.<p>The theory is that by buying the permits off companies they loose the ability to carelessly grow their emissions. At some point it's going to be more economic for them to curb the emissions than try to buy more permits from someone else in the market. Especially since Sandbag retires them and won't resell them at any price.",1228362895

And that's an area where I personally feel that Mercurial's method actually makes more sense than git's, though you're welcome to disagree.<p>[Edit: Oh, and: yes, that's a perfect example of where rebasing makes sense, and is exactly the kind of rebase operation Mercurial now fully supports, without any complicated patch wrangling.]",1228362305

It's just that the big ones weren't very big by modern standards.</i><p>In your essay you predict that ""large organizations will probably never again play the leading role they did up till the last quarter of the twentieth century"". Are you suggesting that average company size will revert to a level lower than even 1900?  Or are you saying that average company size may remain roughly the same, it's just that economic dynamism will come from startups, rather than corporate laboratories?",1228361898

385264,comment,385140,385235,0,0,Shamiq,,,"There are a lot of economic reasonings behind supporting either carbon credits, a tax (known as a Pigouvian Tax), and straight up Command and Control (you will only pollute amount X).<p>The failure in selecting the ""correct"" one depends on issues with how the marginal-damage-to-the-environment curve looks like. Ideally, we want the tax equal to the amount of damage the individual is causing at a given level. But, if the marginal damage curve is very flat, ie an additional unit of pollution doesn't have a large magnitude in effect, then an incorrect tax amount can lead to a lot of ""dead weight loss"" (ie we're not at optimal levels).<p>This explanation is easier with graphs. Therefore, let me know if this is not very clear, and I'll whip up something appropriate.",1228361593

Digg is intimidating in its design, which appeals to young male geeks more than old female nongeeks.

I know several PHP guys who made the switch...but, there are numerous areas where Ruby shows its immaturity and Perl is far more competent: Unicode, block scope, VM performance, concurrency, library breadth and depth, just to name a few.<p>I like Ruby and think it's a very fine language.  I've implemented a couple of small projects in Ruby, and had fun with it.  I find it as readable and writable as any language I've used.  But, I'm confident I could accomplish almost any task I would ever need to accomplish faster in Perl, and the result would run faster, smaller, and more reliably.  The same is true of Python, though to a lesser degree (though some of the problem features in Python are more uncomfortable for me...closures, in particular), but at least it has <i>some</i> Unicode support built in (or bolted on with reasonable competence), and the VM tends to be closer to the speed of Perl than Ruby.",1228359984

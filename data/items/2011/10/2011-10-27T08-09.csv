3162206,comment,3160663,3161536,7,0,ctl,,,"This is a pretty strong reaction to a pretty mild proposal. You know that the US already has a minimum wage and a standard workweek, right? The parent is advocating increasing the minimum wage 20% and decreasing the standard workweek 12.5%. That's not Stalinism.<p>Now, it's reasonable to point out that skilled laborers are basically fully employed right now, so the proposal would marginally reduce the supply of skilled labor hours -- and could thereby reduce skilled output.<p>But FWIW I don't think that's a very good point. Skilled labor is not really hour-limited in the same way that unskilled labor is -- that is, the output of a salaried full-time knowledge-worker employee is unlikely to change much (certainly not by 12.5%) if the standard workweek drops from 40 hours to 35. That's not how knowledge jobs work and that's not how salaried positions work. Whereas productivity in unskilled positions really <i>would</i> drop by somewhere close to 12.5% under the proposal. (Which is good; it opens up more of these ""job"" things that are so crucial to wealth distribution in the modern world.)<p>At any rate, if shorter work weeks for skilled workers bothers you that much, there's an easy solution: just say that you can only pay the minimum wage for the first 35 hours of the week, after which you have to pay at least 1.5 * minimum wage. Leave everything else the same. (Well, I like the parent's minimum wage hike too.) Now we're only cutting the output of near-minimum-wage workers.<p>I'm not at all sure that this idea <i>wouldn't</i> be disastrous, but I can't think of any good reasons that it might be. I feel like it's the most obvious way out of the current economic situation.",1319705983

It has many new features like offline maps, Google location integration, 3D vector maps etc. and she can look forward to more being added.<p>Meanwhile, if she'd bought a 3G (which has near identical hardware) she'd have had to plug her iPhone into a computer, updated iTunes, and then updated the iPhone to get iOS 3 after a year. She'd have had to do this again to get iOS 4, which would have nearly bricked her phone due to it's lack of speed (despite not actually providing many of the actual features of iOS 4). She could then partially fix this by updating iTunes and the iPhone again after a few point updates were released and then would no longer receive any updates to anything Apple considers part of the OS.<p>Both systems have ups and downs (e.g. I'm surprised that the Android browser isn't something that's updated independently as you'd think that would fit Google's goals very well, but I assume there's technical issues I don't understand). A fixation on the version number of the OS, or false stereotypes about Android and iOS, obscures all of this.<p>Finally, the point about the JIT (which I realise I wasn't clear about) is that it only provides benefit if the phone has sufficient RAM. Random people on Android forums would naturally assume <i>newer=better</i> and be disappointed that they didn't have the new shiny, but my phone was somewhat unique in having a large amount of RAM (relative to the rest of the hardware specs anyway). It's therefore a good example of people <i>feeling</i> like they're missing out on something, that would actually <i>hurt</i> their performance if they got it.",1319705864

Since paying back debt means that you use some of your disposable income to pay back the debt instead of spending it, it actually equates <i>positive</i> savings.<p>You can see that the savings rate had a huge spike upwards in the US after the mortgage bubble burst, for precisely that reason: <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/PSAVERT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/PSAVERT</a><p>And - as you say - that's largely responsible for the economic mess we're in right now, because larger savings have translated to lower aggregate demand, which has lead to net layoffs.

Mathmatics made a whole other language to communicate with because spoken language wasn't effective enough.<p>Further, natural language is useful among people because we can work out meanings, fill in implicit statements closely enough, have experience on what certain phrases mean and so on.  Even with every tool we have, we <i>often</i> still get it wrong.  So if it takes so much intelligence to be able to communicate with written language, why would anyone imagine it a good idea to expect computers to be able to do this too?  A computer must explicitly be told what to do in every situation.  Typically when we need to go into that level of detail <i>with people</i> we don't use natural language either.

mutiple models -> single model -> multiple models<p>I mean, people went from wanting different things, to wanting the same thing, to back wanting different things<p>And I think this is how, sony, samsung and motorolla will start to eat into the iphone market share<p>Of course the other school of thought is, we only need one good model, mobile are more like TVs rather than Cars (all TVs nowadays look the same)<p>Which direction do you think will lead the way?",1319702929

The people who may try to shame you as a quitter, will be people who will benefit from you not quitting. People who actually care about you will understand that you need to do what is best for your evolution as a programmer and human being. You have to watch out for your own best benefit. The company, especially if it is full of smart people as you say it is, will survive without you just fine. Depending on the founders, the board of directors, and the investors, it will also, without a qualm, throw you under the bus if that is beneficial to them, especially if you already do not get along with the founder. This is not to say that all companies/founders/directors are evil, but you have to be aware of the risk/benefit and judge it rationally, rather than sacrificing your own well-being, your irreplaceable time, and your energy on a company that does not appreciate it, nor give you a fair exchange mentally or financially.",1319702885

I would highly advise disregarding your stock options altogether - if they ever amount to anything, it will be a nice surprise, but counting as a direct benefit is not sensible when they will, as with most startups, never amount to anything significant compared to the amount of time and energy you invest. If you burn your energy on a product and company you do not believe in, doing work that is not mentally rewarding, you will eventually burn out.<p>- if you are not sold on the product, and the product is not technically challenging, neither will you produce your best work, nor will you learn much from building it. You can either<p>A) create your own skunkworks in the company, and find ways to make product more interesting to yourself by designing, prototyping, and proposing new features that _are_ technically challenging and give product what it lacks. This only makes sense if you believe that the company will appreciate your efforts, and that the product can be salvaged.<p>B) Find something else you can learn while at the company - better project management skills, pair programming so you can learn from other developers how they think and use their tools, learning how to manage people, learning how to talk to investors and network, etc...<p>C) If you cannot find anything else you can learn while you are at the company, quit. Good developers are hard to find right now, you should have little trouble finding other work.",1319702762
3162065,comment,3161420,3161733,5,0,nandemo,,,"Like ghshephard said, in general bonds aren't really risk-free.<p>""Risk-free"" is a theoretical concept. Roughly speaking, it's an assumption used to simplify financial equations, analogous to assuming ""no friction"" in high-school physics problems when the friction coefficient is small enough.<p>The usual rationale for assuming that a country will always pay back its debts is that it can print its own currency at will. But this is not the case for the euro, since an individual member country cannot freely print euros. It's also not the case for dollar-denominated bonds issued by emerging countries. Indeed, even bonds issued by the two largest and more stable powers in the world (US and Japan) aren't 100% risk-free. They might be able to keep borrowing money and not defaulting, but likely at the cost of inflating their currencies, i.e, investors still get the nominal dollars and yen back, but they will be worth less in terms of goods. The closest thing to risk-free is an US Treasure bill.",1319702760

For example, Kindle and Netflix. The way they comply with the guidelines is by removing <i>any</i> link to the website where you can sign up. If there is no way for the user, via tapping in your app, to give you money outside of in-app purchasing, then the app should pass muster.<p>So you basically have 3 viable choices. The first is to offer in-app subscriptions, and live with the 30% cut that Apple takes. Note that this option is going to be the most convenient for your users, if you care about that sort of thing.<p>The second is to offer in-app purchasing for 43% more than the regular price. After Apple's 30% cut, this will leave you with the original subscription amount. Note that this is not particularly user-friendly because they're now paying 43% more for the same service.<p>The third is to remove any and all links to your site from the app. Make it very clear in your app description that this app requires an active subscription, and live with the fact that some users are braindead and will give you 1 star because your app doesn't work for them (because they don't have a subscription).",1319702743

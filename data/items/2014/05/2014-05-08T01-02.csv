Its part of a larger ideological debate about how to regulate the telecom industry. The trend over the last 20 years at the FCC has been rooted in conservative economic thinking. Deregulate the industry, use auctions to allocate spectrum, etc. The 1996 reforms didn&#x27;t achieve everything it was billed to, but the fact is: 1) at the end of the day, Washington views it as largely successful; 2) the state of the internet in the U.S. is competitive with other large western countries: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709948"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709948</a>. The telcos certainly don&#x27;t lack numbers to point to to show the competitiveness of the U.S. industry under the existing regime.<p>Net neutrality is a hard sell because it goes quite against the prevailing thought at the FCC. It has the support of many netopions, but not really among the mainstream/conservative economists that carry the most weight in these policy debates.<p>The internet companies need to lobby, sure, but they also need a &quot;hook.&quot; And &quot;openness&quot; and &quot;neutrality&quot; which are words that resonate in Silicon Valley on their own are not ones that resonate in Washington.<p>To compare, look how the environmental movement has responded. Environmental groups don&#x27;t talk about &quot;conservation&quot; and fuzzy ideas like that, not anymore, not in Washington. They talk about externalized costs and concrete economic phenomena that justify regulation. The tech industry needs to ground net neutrality in something like that.<p>Incidentally, this is part of a debate that has been raging for 30+ years. Telecom and wireless regulation has spawned thousands of journal articles and thesises. Politicians don&#x27;t read these things, of course, but they&#x27;re hugely influential to the technocrats that do the first draft proposals. At least to the extent they can back ideological viewpoints with a theory-based narrative.",1399514197

7713583,comment,7712328,7713394,16,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"The algorithm was esoteric, confined to compilers. But there was no technical reason why it could not be implemented in a library: just nobody had done it yet. It was a hole waiting to be filled. It&#x27;s also really fun to embarrass the compiler!<p>A deep understanding of the algorithm took me a long time, I think a few months. That was mainly due a lack of information describing the technique. The paper that Andrei linked to (Granlund-Montgomery) is dense and contains a significant error, which I was never able to get resolved. Henry Warren&#x27;s celebrated Hacker&#x27;s Delight is more accessible, but is also more of a proof-of-correctness than a learning resource. So my intuitive understanding came from my own investigating and playing around, which is what lead me to find an improvement on the algorithm.<p>Implementing libdivide took me maybe six months of my hobby time. It&#x27;s not just the core algorithm - there&#x27;s a lot of auxiliary functions, for example to compute the high half of a 64 bit multiply in SSE. But working at that level is tons of fun.<p>Incidentally, I wrote up what I hope to be the most accessible (yet still rigorous) description of the algorithm at <a href=""http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/labor-of-division-episode-i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/labor-of-division-episo...</a> .

Other implicit actions are often far richer in quantity and quality -- time spent on an article, interactions and discussion, the <i>quality</i> of that discussion (see pg&#x27;s hierarchy of disagreement, for example), and other measures.  As Robert Pirsig noted, defining quality is hard.<p>• Whose ratings you consider matters.  The problem of topic and quality drift happens as general interests tend to subvert the initial focus of a site or venue.  Those which can retain their initial focus will preserve their nature for a longer period of time, but even that is difficult.  Increasingly, my sense is that you want to be somewhat judicious in who you provide an effective moderating voice to, but those who get that voice should be encouraged to use it copiously.  Policing the moderators (to avoid collusion and other abuse) becomes a growing concern (see reddit and its recent downvote brigades against /r/technology and /r/worldnews).",1399512645

It&#x27;s happening all over again, except this time the repercussions will be far worse then any anti-piracy bill.<p>I&#x27;m not saying lobbying is the only solution, but if the entities on the wrong side of the argument are doing it, does it matter if Google, Amazon, Facebook and other companies issue statements and express concerns to congress if it will only fall on deaf ears or be brushed off as a selfish act?<p>It kind of reminds me of when Labor were in power in Australia before the recent election and were in the process of rolling out the National Broadband Network (NBN) which was a fibre to the premises plan the current party has basically scrapped. Google Australia issued a statement saying the current Government needs to understand the value of such a network, but they were shrugged off.

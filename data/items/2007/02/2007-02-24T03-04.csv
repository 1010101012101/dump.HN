822,comment,813,813,0,0,ninwa,,,"What? I thinks the author goes a bit far with his idea that people need to talk. Does anybody remember how and why BBS' were so popular? It's because you had a voice, an anonymous voice, and you could share information without being judged. I don't know why the author thinks that people on sites don't communicate (maybe I missed the jist of the article entirely), but just because people aren't doing VOIP doesn't mean they have no 'voice'.

Google used the funds to buy servers which they couldn't afford before, but in the end it turned out to be money well spent.  But if you just raise the money to live up to the convention, then you should think again.  The worst thing you could do is to go on a spending spree just to look busy.",1172286258

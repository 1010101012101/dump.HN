A small excerpt:<p><i>&quot;Tony Gwynn died recently, just last month, of salivary gland cancer. (…) He was a great ball player, and a great man. He had salivary gland cancer for 8 years. (…) Every article about Gwynn&#x27;s death quite rightly celebrated his prowess on the ball field and what a wonderful man he was. The last 4 and a half years of his life disappeared from all of the accounts. The only thing they ever said was that he had a 4-and-a-half year &quot;battle&quot; with cancer. And you know how much I hate that word, &quot;battle.&quot; (…) You know, his experience of it--he continued to coach baseball at San Diego State. How did it affect his coaching? What did it do to his religious faith? How did it alter his relationship with his wife? All of this went unsaid, and it just disappeared into one word--battle.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/07/dg_myers_on_can.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/07/dg_myers_on_can.htm...</a>",1433771966

No system is harder to maintain than one that consists of a huge mesh of configuration files.\nNo kidding, I have worked on a large company-wide reporting system where the easiest changes to make were to the code. Code changes could be made, tested and released in a fairly straightforward way.\nThe harder things to change were to configuration files (Spring, things like that). Because they had global effect, and contained elements that were specific to a dev/test/production environment, making and deploying changes to one were more difficult.\nBut the very hardest things to make changes in were the report and process parameters stored in the database. They were impossible to isolate the effects of since we had no easy way to trace to what functions they might affect, and were generally treated as immutable legacy that you worked around changing rather than touch.\n(I wouldn&#x27;t claim this was a good system)<p>When you put something in a configuration file, you need to define who is going to change it, and how they are going to test their change.

I have a cheap wall clock that runs about a year on a AA.  The prices are very hard to understand on Amazon but you&#x27;re looking at about $4 or more per rechargeable eneloop AA and around 40 cents for an alkaline AA in bulk.  I think its fair to compare onsie-twosie rechargeables to bulk disposables; isn&#x27;t that the entire point of being rechargeable?  So I need to keep that clock powered up for more than a decade to run a profit on the rechargeable.  Honestly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll hold up that long.  You need to recharge that dude more than, say, every six months, to run a profit, longer than that and its cheaper to dispose.<p>Presumably they don&#x27;t charge $4 for a top of the line NiMH and 40 cents for an alkaline just for fun, I think its extremely safe to estimate the rechargeable causes at least 10x the environmental damage as the alkaline.  Obviously the linear damage is 10x alone, some employee somewhere will get that $4 instead of 40 cents and buy gasoline or food or other petrochemical related substance, plus the issues with nickel refining, the electrolyte is somewhat more exciting, etc.  So its not just a financial win.",1433771019

They well aware that the odds are stacked against them and many of them can quote the statistical probability of their making (or not making) a profit on their play, but they still gamble because a). it&#x27;s amusing and b). because just maybe they&#x27;ll get lucky and will get a bazillion percent return on their investment - plus, the amount they spend on the lottery is totally meaningless to them.<p>Eventually you get to a point where the $5 (or whatever it costs) is so trivial it makes zero difference in your life, so why not, right? It&#x27;s not really that much unlike Venture Capitalists. 95% of startups fail, yet they still get VCs clamoring to invest in them every year because 5% of them may pay off a windfall return. VCs are no slouches in finances; they&#x27;re sharp, quick witted, ruthless hustlers, yet still they play this lottery.<p>I would say that the lottery is less a tax on the poor than it is a tax on those that are either ignorant to the math, aren&#x27;t risk averse or are well off enough that the cost of playing the lottery is much less meaningful to their bottom line than the potential win would be.<p>After all, at least 1 person wins it most weeks, and every play has an equal chance of being a winner - why not you?  I&#x27;ll spend my $5 on ice cream, because I&#x27;d rather do something that will definitely make me feel good now than spend $5 buying a piece of paper that will most probably be garbage in a few hours and make me feel like I wasted the money - in the hope that just perhaps I&#x27;ll get rich and never have to worry about anything again, supposedly; though, I guess it&#x27;s no different than people supporting the Leafs, hoping every week that their team will win, only to get crushed when they lose...again.

He later moved from there to the big city, took correspondence studies on electricity and started a tour around multiple companies and projects as an electrician until he settled on one company (a company that started small but later became one of the biggest multinational corporations of pool products) where he worked until retiring.<p>Sometimes he would do side jobs fixing pools and fancy installations on the high profile clients. I&#x27;ve been there with him helping out. He once told me: &quot;see these big houses, two pools and an spa? They think they need all this, but have no time to enjoy themselves. Me? I have everything I ever wanted.&quot;<p>He has been all his life self learning just as a pastime. His side project being going back to his old village to build a well and water installations to help farmers irrigate their fields. He even used water pressure to make a kind of &#x27;protocol&#x27; to communicate different panels. When you go there, it&#x27;s crazy land. He&#x27;s been iterating over his initial design for more than 40 years, and he keeps going at it now at 79. One thing he usually says, contrary to what most people think is that life is long, really long. There&#x27;s time for everything.<p>We come from two different worlds. To me it&#x27;s not just about him being a role model but showing him gratitude for all he has taught me.",1433770251

However, alternative theoretical models can be constructed for possible experimental tests or at least anecdote collection.<p>Surely all progress comes from the unreasonable man.  Also we only hear about the most famous / rich creative geniuses.  I have no particular problem switching off creativity and hanging out (going hiking or something), I am also not famous, not even internet famous.  That would lead to the theoretical model that famous people can&#x27;t shut off their unreasonableness, perhaps at all, which makes them completely cantankerous and anti-social yet also somewhat more productive than better balanced individuals.  All kinds of interesting experiments could be devised.  Are they able to shut anything at all off, or are they OCD/addicted personalities?  If someone who can shut off is converted intentionally or otherwise into someone who looses control of their creativity, are they more successful?  College binge drinking to emulate an alcoholic might be monkey see monkey do emulation of creatives... does someone naturally somewhat creative who gains an uncontrollable addiction have the bleed over into uncontrollable creativity?<p>Another interesting model revolves around the only socially rejected people the general public ever hears about, are the top of the line creatives.  That probably tells a lot more about our culture than about the individuals.  For example, I suspect the panhandler at my freeway onramp is socially rejected, at least by most, its just &quot;we&quot; will never hear about him unless he becomes a famous painter or poet.  Given his cardboard signs I think he&#x27;s not creative at all, at least not WRT the graphical arts, yet he&#x27;s got more rejection than most of us.  IF most people are socially rejected to some extent or another, thats kind of the purpose of mass media and big cities after all, and the only rejects we hear about are creatives, then a very weird conclusion could be drawn that creativity only comes from rejection, although the reality is almost everyone is somewhat rejected.  Much like they all drink water and all creatives drink water so creativity obviously comes from drinking water.",1433769655

It shouldn&#x27;t be on the market.<p>Sure you can build a boost converter that gives you a constant 1.5v. That&#x27;s not a bad idea. I&#x27;ve actually designed a couple of these myself on a larger scale over the years (professionally, for military radio equipment, not Joule Thief hacks). That&#x27;s not under debate. The following points are:<p>1. Even the best alkaline batteries leak if you discharge them too much so you&#x27;ll end up destroying your equipment and the Batterisers that you invested in at the same time. Seriously, take a 220 ohm resistor and stick it across a Duracell AA battery and leave it for a few days. You will come back to a rancid mess.<p>2. There is a cost. So you&#x27;re going to need 4 of these for your average device that requires a 6v supply. now my 12v radio packs are 8xAA batteries so imagine the incidental cost over the top of the batteries there. To power kids toys you could have tens of these in the house. Over the top of disposable batteries, it&#x27;s a poor investment.<p>3. 8x is simply horse shit, as DLJ points out. Even with a fairly efficient conversion ratio, and I haven&#x27;t done the figures, just a finger in the air estimate based on the amount of energy your average alkaline AA has, you&#x27;re looking at 1.2-2.0x the life.<p>4. Wonderful things like AA batteries are terribly variable in the tail end of their discharge curve. Not all batteries in a pack are going to still be kicking out current or even have a suitably low internal resistance compared to their immediate colleagues. If one of these fails early, it will take the advantage away from the rest of the cells instantly.<p>5. Noise. Boost converters usually generate a lot of electrical noise in the signal paths. If you have any analogue parts, particularly audio that are expecting to have a relatively noiseless power supply (batteries are quite noise free) then the design will perform worse with these.<p>Now the killers:<p>1. If this was such a great idea, why is it not built into the equipment? (because it represents a risk to the equipment)<p>2. Why the hell would you bother with this when Sanyo (well Panasonic now) Eneloops represent a better investment than both alkaline batteries and these. They handle over 1000 charge, discharge cycles no problems at all, have a good very good shelf life due to low self-discharge characteristics, don&#x27;t leak and have a decent peak current capacity and discharge curve.<p>It&#x27;s just a waste of time.",1433768441

This mixing of the domains which in reality is quite complex is also apparent in your examples.

While it is true that pure-FP, because of its relationship to some types of logic, lets you prove some properties about your code in the code itself, that does not make it any more mathematical than other languages and other approaches. For example (and I give this example often, but only because I&#x27;m really impressed by that language), Esterel, a language designed in the eighties is an imperative language with lots and lots of global side effects, yet it allows you to verify its correctness absolutely, and you don&#x27;t even need to write the proof yourself (it verifies temporal properties that are especially hard to prove using PFP). Esterel and languages (mostly graphical languages) inspired by it have been used by the industry orders of magnitude more than PFP languages for domains where correctness is crucial. That PFP allows you to write some proofs in code does not mean that there aren&#x27;t better ways to verify programs mathematically. PFP is the answer if what you&#x27;re asking for is more second-order logic in your PL; it&#x27;s just one of many if you&#x27;re just asking for more math (in fact, it&#x27;s just one of many even if you want more interesting type systems).<p>Also, it&#x27;s hard to trace influences, but I believe that the focus on immutability that is finding its way into more and more languages is actually inspired by Erlang and later Clojure, two languages that have little to do with PFP, and a lot to do with the design of multi-core and distributed systems. It was not the current academic trend of pursuing the Curry-Howard correspondence as a software verification technique, but an industry solution for the problem of handling concurrency.",1433768425

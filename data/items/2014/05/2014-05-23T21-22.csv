Making that userspace as much like Linux as possible reduces the incremental maintenance effort, which is critically important given the limited number of developers.<p>(You could reasonably ask the value of developing Hurd at all, but given a set of people wanting to develop it, it makes sense for them to do so using a Debian userspace.)",1400881947

Echoing another commenter on this thread, &quot;X vs Y&quot; comparisons, which encourage religious tensions, are not super productive. These framework decisions come down to case-by-case technical requirements (and personal preference + experience)<p>All of that said, my favorite thing about Angular is that it&#x27;s a framework for building frameworks, and the sky&#x27;s the limit on how you want to handle just about every piece of your app.  You can set up your own reactive data models in Angular, for example--but not as easily and immediately (from what I can tell from this docs link) as you can with Deps.<p>Would you rather use Heroku or EC2?  Write an application in C or Python?  Buy pasta from the store or make it from scratch?  Depends on expertise and requirements.<p>Sometimes low-level flexibility (e.g. with Angular) is invaluable, since each project comes with unique requirements that can&#x27;t always be addressed with more abstracted, batteries-included solutions. More specifically, sometimes you end up fighting against batteries-included frameworks when abstractions prove too leaky.<p>Sometimes, though, batteries-included tools (e.g. Meteor) make all the difference between needing to staff one engineer or four, or being able to write and deploy an app in a few hours instead of a few days.",1400881894

You probably updated to 8.1 before Lenovo updated its drivers or bought an old touchpad that was actually meant for Windows 7 and is no longer supported by them.

Hot Corners drive them absolutely crazy, or they will accidentally pinch to zoom or they will scroll by mistake and not realize whats happening. There is always a learning curve, even in the most user friendly operating systems like iOS. And what actual computer do you have? The problem is people use a $400 Dell and then compare it to a $2000 Retina or $1200 Air. The Surface Pro 3 is a premium Apple like device, and what do you know, early reviews from places like The Verge say its the best possible Windows 8 experience.

7791431,comment,7790075,7790891,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I have to disagree with much of this comment<p><pre><code>   > I think that college is great. But also, I think it\n   > can also be somewhat dangerous to one&#x27;s ability to think for oneself.\n   > There is always one and only correct answer, and there is an authority\n   > figure who knows what it is.\n</code></pre>\nI find this assertion to be very surprising. In my experience college, unlike high school, the entire point was to get students thinking for themselves, rather than accepting that there was a single correct answer. In my freshman year, and in the freahman year of each of my three daughters, there was always a required class which included a &quot;colloquium&quot; or &quot;discussion&quot; component. These classes were designed to break students of the habit of treating what was said, or read, as &#x27;the answer&#x27; and to instead think critically about the facts being tossed about.<p><pre><code>   > University culture promotes reading and learning without \n   > taking action and making real impact. It also encourages \n   > that you seek to be told what is right and what is wrong, \n   > instead of endeavoring to figure it out for yourself.\n</code></pre>\nAgain, my experience differs. Were I or my kids to discover that the University they were attending felt that way I would immediately withdraw into a more traditional institution of higher learning, which starts with the premise &quot;everything we know may be false, here are the tools we use to understand truth in the world around us.&quot;<p><pre><code>   > But I guess being a good employee requires a lot of those qualities \n   > that I mentioned above. You have to be a good follower.\n</code></pre>\nAgain, I would disagree. As an employer I value employees who think over those to simply follow orders. One of the things I try to ascertain in interviewing folks is whether or they do think. Can they reason to their opinion on a topic or do they hold it simply because someone else shared it with them? My experience in high school was that many people held opinions because they were &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;expected&quot; rather than holding them because they believed in them. It was one of the most depressing parts of that period of my life and I was so relieved when I got to college that people weren&#x27;t like that really.<p><pre><code>   > College is valuable, but I think society would be better off if we did not \n   > focus so much on jobs, status, success, failure, etc. Why not focus on how \n   > to create value or make the world a better place? These are things that a \n   > college education alone cannot teach you how to do.\n</code></pre>\nOne of the interesting statistics is we passed 30% of the US having a college degree in early 2012 [1]. So if 70% of the people in a group don&#x27;t have college degrees, it is difficult to reason about whether or not &#x27;society&#x27; would be better off or not. You could ask the 30% of degree holders how they evaluate creating value in society, you could ask the 70% the same question, and then you could ask which of those two groups has a better idea of what kinds of things make the world a better place.<p>But a different approach might give better answer. Ask those two groups this question, &quot;How would you go about figuring out if what you were doing was helping the world be a better place?&quot;<p>College prepares people to answer questions of that form, ones that require the student to not only come up with an answer, but to construct a process for arriving at the answer that gives them confidence in the result. No pre-made formula, no quick peek at Wikipedia, but basic reasoning from first principles.<p>I know several people who have that skill and did not go to college, but pretty much everyone who graduated from college had that skill tested many times and had to pass that test in order to graduate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/education/census-finds-bachelors-degrees-at-record-level.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/education/census-finds-bac...</a>",1400880342

So UNC Chapel Hill is heavily represented among our team, and it&#x27;s hardly a bad school.  But I&#x27;ve always maintained that when we have money to start recruiting &quot;real employees&quot;, I intend to recruit at places like NCCU (North Carolina Central University), NC A&T, Fayetteville State, UNC-Pembroke, St. Augustines, Meredith, Shaw, William Peace, UNC-Greensboro, Wake Tech, Durham Tech, etc.<p>Why?  Well, because I believe that are good, smart, talented people to be found there, and with the bonus that we&#x27;re less likely to be competing against Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. for talent there.   And furthermore, I find that you sometimes find people from the less touted schools who have something of a chip on their shoulders, have something to prove, and are just plain hungry to achieve.   And those are people I like working with.<p>Anyway, sure, if you have a chance to go to Stanford or Berkeley or MIT, go for it.  Why wouldn&#x27;t you?

A browserify/webpack workflow requires that you set all of that up for each project, and to start your watch task every time you develop. So if you&#x27;re working a few different projects you either have to switch between them or start new watch tasks for each. I understand that some people enjoy this workflow and am not saying they are &quot;wrong&quot;, just pointing out the added requirements.",1400878925

It is clearly not his focus (or area of expertise!) but the book makes its premise clear: extreme inequality is inconsistent with the meritocratic ideals upon which modern capitalist democracies are founded, and can lead to social unrest. This is close to a direct quotation from the book&#x27;s introduction --0 I would quote it exactly if I had the book in front of me right now. Maybe you don&#x27;t agree with this premise, but I don&#x27;t think you can fault Piketty for taking it as an assumption (explicitly!), particularly given that he is not a sociologist or political philosopher.<p>And in either case, it strikes me a significant contribution in itself to move the debate from &quot;does capitalism and rising productivity raise all boats?&quot; (answer: no) to &quot;ok then...is extreme inequality really such a bad thing?&quot;",1400878881

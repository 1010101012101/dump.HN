The IO accounting built into most operating systems will tell you. iotop exposes it in an easy to read form that doesn't require learning a new programming language.<p>Oddly enough, the last reason I heard for ZFS was intercepting printfs to show SQL calls. Kind of like using MySQLs debug mode, but like the previous example requiring learning a new programming language for no benefit.<p>It seems many dtrace advocates lack basic system administration skills.<p>dtrace (and systemtep on Linux) are useful for tracing kernel level issues if you're a kernel developer.

There aren't many differences between the browsers these days in terms of js at all. Rendering? sure. CSS? definitely. But js, and dom manipulation pretty much just works.

The article mentioned dozens of other labs and actually had a peer review done of an Israeli lab. The DARPA report was a review of all of those efforts, not just McKubre.<p>2) The fact that energy is being created ""seems"" to be reproducible, just not regularly reproducible. That is, there seems to be a cause-and-effect, but nobody is exactly certain of the cause<p>3) A theory is not needed for further investigation. In fact, more data is needed in order for possible theories to come out -- that's the process of abduction<p>It's not ""normal"" science, but it's obvious that it's the scientific method going on -- we're just at the first stage which is data collection. If the data is anomalous with existing theory, then either the data is wrong or existing theory needs to be modified.

Charging $X with the option of paying $1.1X (or just over, even) for a 0.1 probability of getting the money straight back will get the most people buying into the scheme. That'll be around 1 in 10 people too. Force the extra payment and around half of them will walk away there and then(1). Bump the price up to $1.1X without mentioning it, only that there's a 1 in 10 chance of getting it free and you'll see the overall take-up go up anywhere from 25% to 100%.<p>Long story short: <i>Make your new price $1.1X without fanfare, offer a 1 in 10 chance of getting it for free and you all win.

If you look at a lot of the ""successes"" that you would want to get there before they were reaching slightly beyond current tech/social environment. For example, Flickr/YouTube were predicated on the fact that storage costs were crashing and end user bandwidth was drastically increasing. You couldn't have created them much earlier.<p>Wikipedia was timed for the explosion of users on the internet allowing for massive crowd sourcing, again you couldn't have gotten there much earlier.<p>The best way to leverage knowledge like that would be to go back and become the world's most prescient VC. Also avoiding the bubble bursting and the current crash would be great.<p>I like the idea of going back and getting myself into a position to work on some of these projects though. being able to be there when they happened would be cool",1240225766

Brad Templeton (the writer of the essays I linked to) predicts that robocars should be able to co-exist with human drivers (though there would be some advantages if all cars had autonomous capability, such as increasing road capacity by reducing follow distance, and optimizing the design of parking garages).<p>My interest is primarily on reducing deaths. I'm fortunate enough that I've never lost a close friend in a car accident, but two friends of mine have been injured (one moderately, one seriously), a close friend of mine lost his best friend, and the 21-year-old receptionist at my previous employment was killed in a head-on collision. I expect most people have stories like these or worse.<p>The 93% figure comes from Wikipedia, and the citation is a report that doesn't define human error. Templeton thinks that robocars could eliminate almost all of the million car accident deaths per year. But even if it's only 50%, that would prevent so much avoidable loss.<p>Templeton:\n""The creators will need to make an urban test track and fill it with swarms of the robots, and demonstrate that they can walk out into the swarm with no danger. Indeed, like a school of fish, it should be close to impossible to touch one even if you try. Likewise, skeptics should be able to get onto bicycles, motorcycles, cars and hummers and drive right through the schools of robots, unable to hit one if they try. After doing that for half an hour and getting tired, doubters will be ready to accept them on the roads.""<p>If that can be achieved, robocars will drastically reduce deaths.",1240225701

Tons of companies exist solely for organizational (as in, keeping things neat and orderly) purposes, and as pass-through entities into other companies.

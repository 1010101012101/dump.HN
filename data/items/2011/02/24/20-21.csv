I see discussion of banner ads on major sites, AdWords, roadblocks on various ad networks, Daring Fireball RSS, MacWorld banner ads, but nothing about AdMob or MobClix. Maybe they tried that and it didn't work also, but it would have been nice to hear some specifics. I've heard of multiple people having success using AdMob to drive downloads, and that makes more sense to me than a Daring Fireball RSS sponsorship. The channels they named seem more like places you'd use to market Mac software (something they have experience with) than places you'd go to market an iOS app. None of this is to say they don't know how to market iOS apps - they've sure sold a lot more than me. ;)",1298581080

They failed to yield <i>that</i> many result relative <i>relative</i> to the effort and resources that were put into them. And they especially failed to yield as many results as you could get by just increasing raw clock speed. And their cost was not just their raw complexity but the training required for programmer to understand parallelism (the low cost of today's ""entry level"" programmer is a huge bogus to the IT industry. If companies had to spend a year on system-specific training, the cost would be <i>vast</i>).<p>But given that such projects were only failures <i>relative</i> to the alternative of just coming up with a simple architecture with a higher clock speed, if the alternative is going away, there's no reason they can't become <i>relative</i> successes. Watson was a relative success - if you could have Watson-level processing-power on a single chip programmable with Ruby, the effort IBM put into the project would look silly. But since it looks you can't, Watson seems like a productive use of resources.<p>In a lot of ways, the last thirty years have involved substituting low-cost, high-power chips for high-price, high-skill programmers yielding a huge, de-skilled programming workforce. The end of Moore's-law-<i>for-speed</i> would seem to mean things will move differently in the future.<p>I won't address the particular architecture points you make, which all sound good but are unrelated to the general of previous parallelism efforts ""failing"".",1298580928

They play fantastically well in maybe 90% of\n    positions, but there is a selection of positions they do not understand at all. Worse, by definition\n    they do not understand what they do not understand and so cannot avoid them. A strong human Jeopardy! player,\n    or a human doctor, may get the answer wrong, but he is unlikely to make a huge blunder or category error--\n    at least not without being aware of his own doubts. We are also good at judging our own level of certainty.\n    A computer can simulate this by an artificial confidence measurement, but I would not like to be\n    the patient who discovers the medical equivalent of answering ""Toronto"" in the ""US Cities"" category,\n    as Watson did.\n    \n    I would not like to downplay the Watson team's achievement, because clearly they did something most\n    did not yet believe possible. And IBM can be lauded for these experiments. I would only like to wait\n    and see if there is anything for Watson beyond Jeopardy!.\n</code></pre>\nIf IBM wants to fix the ""Toronto"" problem, have at it. But those sorts of ""embarrassing"" errors could be quite costly in medical situations.

So an approach strongly reliant on the SCM kinda weakens in practice(though, as you point out, it could be used as a _secondary indicator_ or guarantee of work). And in theory, as other commenters say, taken to extremes, one ends up evaluating secondary things and overseeing essential things like the ability to rationally defend the code and explain one's approach.<p>Nevertheless, it is feasible to set up stuff like post-commit hooks (I actually used 'em to monitor the turn ins to an exam) to maybe submit the code to an automated plagiarism detector like [moss](<a href=""http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/</a>), that would be cool, maybe I'll try that out next semester.",1298580612

Advertise in non-intrusive spaces.\n  Upon update, some add-ons automatically open a window with the \n  changelog. Using this space and the space on the add-on's \n  Mozilla page, to advertise.\n  \n  2. Get a sponsorship.\n  On a related note, pitch to companies that target similar audiences.\n  Offer the first few placements for free (or set low enough price that \n  there isn't much risk) and track the traffic. Use these numbers to \n  set a price.\n\n  3. TwitterBar ""via"" field.\n  Twitter links to the webpage for apps that people use to post messages\n  (at least they used to). This should give you leverage to rank any other\n  webpage highly from all the pagerank juice.\n\n  4. Opt-in link juice/affiliate links.\n  A number of the add-ons could potentially have affiliate ID's appended\n  or a link included back to your product page (similar to Twitters ""via""\n  links). Once, you have high ranking pages, the monetization options are \n  unlimited.\n\n  5. [Lastly] Gather email addresses.\n  Perhaps there is a reason users would want to provide their email \n  address? As you mentioned, combining add-ons with a hosted service\n  opens up a lot of opportunities. Email addresses can be used to provide \n  value in a number of different ways (e.g. get beta testers, etc.).\n</code></pre>\nGood luck!!<p>P.S. One more, use your skills to get hired by companies who could benefit from developing Firefox add-ons for their products.",1298578362

3811311,comment,3811146,3811273,1,0,bromley,,,"These are fair concerns.  The journalist just wrote a related blog post at <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/modern-thermometers-1132/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/modern-thermometers-1132/</a> that discusses the ""experience"" of temperature more.<p>An improvement on the analysis might be to adjust all the temperatures for humidity and wind speed etc. before calculating the deviations below 60 F and above 80 F.  My company's system doesn't do that because those other factors are much less important for energy consumption calculations (which is what degree days are traditionally used for).  But I think they probably would be good factors to include for a more thorough analysis of human comfort.  (I say ""probably"" because the complexity would increase considerably and also the figures would become less clearly defined in a sense as well.  So it wouldn't be 100% positive.)",1333817869
3811310,comment,3811148,3811171,10,0,greendrink,,,"This is a key distinction. Attempting to integrate laptops into existing curriculum with teacher training is a sisyphean task for deployments in countries where teachers haven't used (let alone taught with or seen someone teach with) any computer or smartphone before. OLPC made its classroom-transformative ideals clear, but, and this is purely speculation, the popular and misguided notion of what ""ICT for Education"" should be wins out nearly everywhere. Purchased laptops ended up being seen as something they can plug-and-play insert into the existing educational curriculum instead of complementing or supplanting any part of it.<p>OLPC's recipe, followed to a T, would probably work quite well. But the economics and politics of the situation mean these ideals are mutated to the point of inefficacy before the laptops reach the kids.<p>Technology can be plug-and-play and transformative for kids without adult supervision. Watch kids play games. The kids in OLPC deployments pick up the difficult-to-use laptop UI quickly, clicking around and finding ways to have fun with the cameras and make silly videos of their friends singing in the schoolyard when the teachers aren't looking.<p>But in the newly-laptopped classroom the teachers just can't help but revert back to the comfortable pattern of stepping kids through pointing and clicking all the while juggling laptops running out of battery, touchpads on the fritz, and the realities of a classroom full of children. And the teachers are not comfortable with this technology. It's another chapter in their teacher's manual they have to spend their free time to learn, however exciting and novel it is.<p>Get the kids <i>anything</i> with a thriving App Store and give them an internet connection. Set up computer clubs outside of school for structured growth and let them play.",1333817868

Giving the opportunity to the poor child that has born in the countryside to be connected and teach him about technology since is a 5 years old bring an amazing democratizing tool of opportunities to them. And perhaps the only one.<p>I'm from Uruguay and starting in 2006, this is exactly what the government has been done. This has become a national cause. And as far as I know, this has been the most successful implementation to date of this.<p>Uruguay is a relatively small country (similar to Greece but with a lot rural areas) and with a modest population of 3M people.<p>In less than two years (by 2009) the government implemented free wifi connectivity for OLPC kids across the country. The country is very close to 100% wifi connectivity for OLPC kids (run on a separate network) and we're near to 100% 3G costless as-well across the country which works at least at 5Mb / second.<p>In addition to that, the government declared internet as a right that anyone should get, for free. Any uruguayan can claim at least 256k in their houses for free on any part of the country. There's no barrier anymore to be connected. And truth is, people is getting interested in the opportunities of it. The little kid who goes to school in a horse because is 20km far from his house in rural areas now he's aware of a new previously unseen potential and see the opportunities of becoming a designer or a programmer. And this is really happening.<p>However, is naive to think computers alone will do the trick. Bringing computers is just the starting point of something bigger which is not only the connectivity, but mostly the educational foundations that should be instrumented afterwards and carefully followed up based on all the feedback. Real iterations based on data and adjusted as the project goes. It may resonate like the same principle of a startup.<p>Here's a summary I found of a pilot OLPC experience in Uruguay. \n<a href=""http://www.divms.uiowa.edu/~hourcade/ceibal-workshop.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.divms.uiowa.edu/~hourcade/ceibal-workshop.pdf</a><p>I heard the people who contribute to this in UY is now beginning to help the Peruvian and other countries with the experience and all we have learned of this to re-create the same kind of educational environments.",1333817261

Then we divided by the number of days in that 5-year period to get the total degree days per day.  The day bits cancelled out, effectively giving the average number of degrees that the temperature deviated from the optimal range.  (I think the WSJ sensibly thought that expressing the data in terms of average temperature deviation would make it more accessible than if it were expressed in terms of degree days, which most people probably aren't familiar with.)<p>We did that calculation for each of the 66 ""global cities"" listed in the 2012 list that you can find on Wikipedia at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city</a><p>Anyway, irrespective of whether the meaning of the figures themselves is intuitive, I think they're ideal for ranking the cities in terms of how favourable their climates are in terms of temperature.<p>The main body article also has some interesting discussion of the ins and outs of using temperature as a measure of a given location's comfort levels.<p>Probably of more interest to me than most as I'm quite chuffed that my company's data was used in the WSJ :)  But putting my shallow ego aside I do think the numbers are cool as I've long been intrigued by the idea of finding the locations on earth with the perfect climates.",1333816693

While it's true that it's more like a peer mentorship, there is a good supply of talents in the program. Some have had exits, some worked at great companies like 37 signals and pivotal tracker, Google, Yahoo and etc. We also have some awesome speakers. Just last week, we had Ahti Heinla, the cofounder of Skype.<p>So far for people in our batch, the biggest source of stress comes from finding apartment while speaking little English. Each company is assigned a padrino, local Chilean entrepreneur to help out with picking you up at the airport and finding apartment. So, you will want to take advantage of that. I exchanged emails and setup Skype call with my padrino prior to arriving in Chile.  It definitely helped with relationship building.<p>The other tip is to really use social media. There is a private Facebook group for Startup Chile participants. I found my current apartment through that.  Also, if you are looking to talk to more participants before you get accepted into the program, try to join the meetup group at <a href=""http://goo.gl/Hw67S"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/Hw67S</a>.<p>Hope that helps,<p>Jerry",1333816316

3811193,comment,3810575,3811164,7,0,jonnathanson,,,"That seems impressive, I agree, and I'm all for giving credit where it's due. But the problem with looking only for ""fingerprints"" is that you're inherently narrowing your search spectrum. By doing so, you're actually making the job <i>easier</i> for terrorists -- whose goal, roughly speaking, is to move to wherever the spotlight isn't shining.<p>Bruce Schneier does a much better job explaining this phenomenon than I can ever hope to. But essentially, there's a good argument to be made that <i>totally random</i> searches are superior to fingerprint searches. Terrorists operate on probabilistic scenario analysis. They will only attempt a plot if they're close to 100% sure that they can pull it off, because a failure embarrasses them in the eyes of their sympathizers and would-be financial benefactors. It makes them look like amateurs, and nobody wants to fund an amateurish organization. So even doing something like randomly screening every Nth passenger (where N changes daily) inherently reduces the odds of success by a fixed daily percentage. Terrorists are more scared of dice rolls than they are of fingerprint searches.<p>I'm no security expert, and for all I know, some combination of random searches and fingerprint searches is the optimal portfolio. I can, at least, understand the logic there, and it makes some sense. But focusing solely on fingerprints creates loopholes everywhere else. And it seems that the TSA has become more and more laser-focused on fingerprints in recent years.",1333814863

A few months later he confided in he that he was scared to death, he felt like he was operating ""without a net"". I naively thought he was being melodramatic.<p>A year later I left to start my first business. And I felt exactly the same. It was frightening, the phrase ""without a net"" summed it up perfectly. My friend's reaction hadn't been melodramatic at all. His reaction was perfectly normal.<p>It may be impossible for someone who has never tried it to understand the emotional challenge of starting a business. That stress is layered on top of all the normal stresses of your work as the sole developer.<p>And perhaps multiplied further by underestimating the schedule? It's easy to fall into the trap of saying ""I will be superman. I will get this done quickly"". I've done it 100 times.<p>Thanks for posting, and be kind to yourself. You'll work it out.",1333814701

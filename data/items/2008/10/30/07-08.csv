348534,comment,348377,348377,0,0,arthurw,,,"Guys, remember, Ycombinator is a great resource but you'll see that some of the ventures they've backed are either completely stupid, already invented by google or simply not existing today because even they failed. Ycombinator seems to be seeking a very specific set of ideas and type of team. My personal opinion is that this lack of diversity in type of ideas and teams doesn't contribute much to the growth of their endeavor. Why just programmers? The real value is in the vision and outsourcing is easier than ever today. Overall, keep at it! I guarantee that many of the ventures Ycombinator didn't accept are going to do well. Good luck.",1225352303

The article mentions that a significant other might ask for genetic testing before marriage. Why would they need to ask? They could just steal some genetic material during the night.<p>Also, these gene companies don't seem to be forthcoming about genetics. There is a lot that we still don't understand. Even if you inherit a gene that is linked to a disease, you may not necessarily express that gene. Genetic expression is very poorly understood right now.",1225350831

I too am a wordsmith, but to me, literature is defined by what it is that it leads the reader to. A fantastically written piece of poetry that has no deeper meaning is, to me, not literature. A piece of vogon poetry with a deeper meaning is also not literature, mind you - there has to be some basic level of craft. In either case, I consider the meaning to be more important than the form.<p>Amateurish as it might be, this piece had a Truth to tell, and to me, that makes it literature. Your point of view is just as valid as mine, so I think we'll just have to agree to disagree :-)",1225350621

He does whatever the Democratic Party does. As President, he will be driven by Congress, he will sign any legislation written by the blue team.<p>Surveillance laws will not be repealed. Non-farmers will be screwed over to benefit farmers. Young people will be screwed over to pay off elderly voters. Consumers will be screwed over to benefit unions. School children will be screwed over to benefit the NEA. Future generations will be screwed over to benefit current generations. Funding for new programs to make Americans more dependent on government will be piled on top of a deficit fast approaching $1 trillion.<p>His speech might be sparkling, but his record does not fill me with Hope.

I actually created an account on Twitter as a result of an discussion on HN but it wasn't at all interesting or engaging.<p>Personally I find twittering too short to express much of anything worth reading creating an extremely high noise to signal ratio. I'm sure it's great for people who are truly interested in what their idol is doing throughout the day but I find it verry difficult to idolize.<p>Twitter to me feels like a reading IRC but you only get to read one line at a time and even though there's millions of people in the room almost everyone is engaged in broadcasting instead of conversations.<p>Although I must say I've enjoyed using the twitter search to see what people are engaged in. It's like sitting at a cafe and just observing people, blissful entertainment.<p>I use Facebook though.",1245779915

I'm not really sure who he's so angry at here) Social Darwinists is a little extreme.<p>Social Darwinism is an ideology, not a process. We can make observations from a sociocultural evolution standpoint, but we can't really label all the winners in whatever situation as Social Darwinists. I think hardly anyone that votes the way they do does so from a Social Darwinist standpoint; it's more or less an extinct ideology in popular politics.<p>So I can say that Bob Republican votes against welfare because he's greedy. I can say that greed is an element of evolution. But I cannot say he's a Social Darwinist until he says something like ""I'm voting this way so my race/class/gender lives, and theirs dies out.""<p>Furthermore, calling someone a Social Darwinist is right up there with calling someone Hitler. Let's not water down the terminology by putting the label on some ignorant woman in a soup kitchen.",1245779786

While having an Firefox plugin is a neat idea, I'm considering developers who would need to take screenshots of bugs across different browsers too :)<p>Freshlog's website isn't a bug tracker actually, the local cocoa app is the one sending the screenshots to an external tracker.<p>And as for the point about threading, when someone replies to a screenshot with a screenshot, the reply gets logically indented. Maybe I should rephrase that part.<p>Thanks for your help comments! :)",1245779494

I never said I want TC coverage, just that I'm in a space where there is no TC, i.e. a relevant site that can send me lots of relevant traffic and that isn't afraid to link to me.  People like to gripe about TC all the time, but it's done a lot of people a lot of good.<p>Your points about having a story are well-taken, too.<p>The reason why I'd like some coverage is because I spend my days calling up local businesses to talk about sponsoring us.  None of them have heard of us.  They don't care how many readers I have or don't have.  If they haven't heard of me, it's not something they're interested in.

I post the occasional tweet (<1/day) and keep up with maybe three friends I have who only use Twitter, but the majority of my social networking is on Facebook.<p>I'm not impressed with the article's rationale for this, though: Twitter seems more likely to assist in creating a public ""self-brand"" than Facebook.  Rather it seems that that people in my age group seem to like forming tighter, less public social networks.  Facebook seems to be popular in my circle because status updates, photos, events, etc. are all aggregated to one place and tightly tied to a selected group of people we want to share with.  My personal use-case is keeping in touch with college friends scattered across the country.<p>Also: most people I know have friends lists that max out in the 150-200 range, which is about what I'd expect for a personal network size.  Twitter, on the other hand, seems to aim at a less personal, more public and wide-ranging network.  Because of this Twitter seems a lot more useful for <i>building</i> a network, but Facebook is better for maintaining connections... which might be more important for the just-out-of-college crowd.",1245779313

Don't take it personally. Thanks. bye."".<p>So in the next email (sent  a minute after I received his reply)  I sent him a zipped  file of code with an explanation that ""this is what I've done so far which is about 70% of what you  want"" and he said ""Whoa you are serious ...' and opened up completely, giving me a lot of useful feedback and very specific advice. I sent him a <i>lot</i> more code over the years. He is a (very valued) mentor to this day.<p>Another time, I was reading a paper from a (very famous) professor at Stanford, and I thought I could fill in some gaps in that paper so I wrote a ""You know your paper could be expanded to give results X and Y. Do you think I should work on it?"" email and I got a very dismissive one line email along he lines of "" That is an old paper and incomplete in certain respects, Thanks"".<p>So I sent along a detailed algorithm that expanded his idea, with a formal  proof of correctness and a code implementation and he suddenly switched to  a more expansive mode, sending  friendly emails with long and detailed corrections and ideas for me to explore.<p>Now I am not in the league of the above two gentlemen, but perhaps because I work in AI and Robotics in India,which isn't too common, I receive frequent emails to the effect of ""please mentor me"", often from students. I receive too <i>many</i> of these emails to answer any in any detail, but if I <i>ever</i> get an email with ""I am interested in AI/ Robotics. This is what I've done so far. Here is the code. I am stuck at point X. I tried A, B, C nothing worked. What you wrote at [url] suggests you may be the right person to ask.  can you help?"" I would pay much more attention than to a ""please mentor me"" email.<p>In other words, when you asks for a busy person's time for ""mentorship"" or ""advice"" or whatever, show (a) you are serious and have gone as far as you can by yourself (b) have taken <i>concrete</i> steps to  address whatever your needs are and (optionally)(c) how helping you could benefit them.<p>Very good (and therefore famous) developers are <i>very</i> busy and have so much stuff happening in their lives and more work than they could ever hope to complete that they really don't have any time to answer vague emails from some one they've never heard of before.<p>As an (exaggerated) analogy, think of writing an email to a famous director or movie star or rock star, saying ""I have these cool ideas about directing/acting/ music. Can you mentor me/give me advice?""<p>I am replacing the words ""app"" and ""technical"" in your sentence below with ""film"" and ""film making"".<p>""if I have an idea for a film that I want to develop, but my film making skills limit me, it would be nice to have people to bounce the idea off and have it implemented. ""(so ..  please mentor me/give me advice/make this film for me).<p>Do you think a top grade director (say Spielberg) would respond to this?<p>The fact that you at least got a 2 line response shows that the developers you wrote to are much nicer than you may think.<p>As someone else advised you, just roll up your sleeves and get to work. If your work is good enough, you'll get all the ""mentoring"" you'll need.

There is also a difference between UI <i>look</i> and UI <i>behavior</i>. By replicating the 280 Slides <i>look</i> (by copying its existing design and images), the best you could do is prove that GWT makes it easy to implement a design, but I do not believe that even this was done in the demo you made.<p>1. I'm not sure what exactly is impressive about this demo, you have a couple buttons which pop up a window that has dummy content in it, and then expect people to think that it proves that making something that looks and behaves like 280 Slides is easy. For starters, this is the least impressive portion of 280 Slides. I don't for example see a slide navigator which shows a tiny version of the working area, and I also don't see a working area that has vector properties that works in all browsers. These are the components which would be hardest to build without Cappuccino in my opinion. I'm not sure even the toolbar works like the one in 280 Slides. For example, when you make the window too small does it auto place the items that aren't visible into a menu on the right based on their priority of importance? If your point was simply that you can make buttons with custom images in GWT, then I guess you've succeeded.<p>2. Beyond this, designing itself is also quite difficult, which I hope is not something we have to argue about, since to say otherwise would be to invalidate the designing profession as a whole. One thing we are trying to do with Cappuccino is provide a good set of base artwork and a HIG that will make this easier for people who can't afford a real designer. Large portions of this work will of course be usable outside of Cappuccino since we are making them open source, but others will be much easier as they will be built into Cappuccino.",1245778180

Sure, it's true, but you aren't locking your door to make your home impenetratable. You're locking your door to prevent casual unauthorized entry. You don't want someone to just wander in while you're away and take things without having to do any work at all. And you don't want someone to just barge in without knocking (well you might, but it's a case for locking your door). Similarly, you aren't masking passwords to make it impossible for anyone to ever know your password. You're masking passwords so you can log in to your email in front of your friends without them getting tempted to use the information they gleaned.<p>Also, I can type faster than most people are probably able to read a keyboard (and my passwords are not words which makes them even harder to figure out), but there is likely no one on earth who can type faster than people can read.<p>---<p>Bad argument #2: It's ok to unmask some passwords because the information isn't critical.<p>Response: Take the example of looking at pictures of your cat. Where are these pictures? Let's suppose they're on Flickr. Actually, it doesn't matter much. Now, does Flickr (or this other website) just allow you to view pictures? No, it also allows you to post pictures (I wouldn't want someone posting their porn pics under my account), chat with friends (DEFINITELY don't want to be impersonated there), and even CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD thereby stealing your account. If you're just talking about password protecting a directory on your computer with cat pictures, sure show the password... but anything this trivial wouldn't be password protected anyway. Simply put, if it's important enough to have a password, it's important enough to have that password masked. Otherwise, why have it at all?<p>---<p>Excellent point: Since users DO use the same password for multiple things, you don't even know or control what credentials you are giving away.

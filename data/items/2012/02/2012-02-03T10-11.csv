Lots of contests are considered good figures of merit.  If you win a nobel prize or a fields medal, that's a sort
of public problem solving exercise.  Would you hire someone who won a nobel prize over someone else, all other things being equal?  I certainly would.<p>Maybe the real issue here is that these interview problems aren't sufficiently challenging or interesting such that the barrier to entry is keeping answer-copiers out.<p>Unless you're Gregori Perelman, for example, you're likely not going to be taken seriously or given much credit for solving the Poincar conjecture.<p>PS.

I added some new stuff to my reading list. :-)<p>Just some notes from a Scala user:<p>Regarding Units: I bundled some work done before by other people into a nicer package/syntax, apart from a few missing bits working with Units looks quite nicely in Scala, even without any special support for it:<p><pre><code>    val mass: Mass[Double] = 4.0 kg
    val longMass: Mass[Long] = mass asLong
    val length: Length[Int] = (5 m) * 3
    val time: Time[Int] = 1 s
    val doubleTime: Time[Int] = time + time
    val temp: Temperature[BigDecimal] = BigDecimal(""22.22"") k
    val speed: Speed[Int] = length / time
    val area: Area[Int] = length * length
    val volume: Volume[Int] = (23 m) * (1 m) * (1 m)
    val smallVolume: Volume[Double] = (volume asDouble) / 12.0
    val area2: Area[Int] = volume / (23 m)
    val accel: Acceleration[Double] = (10.0 m) / ((2.0 s) * (1.0 s))

The type annotations are not needed, but helps undestanding the design.<p>Scala will very likely get macros in the next version, together with pluggable types/type providers. Macros not in a Lisp or ""extend syntax"" sense, but more in a Nemerle sense. Scala macros are written in fully statically typed Scala and are checked at compile time before and after expansion.",1328265827

I'll never get into a dispute about what's faster... legitimate arguments can be made both ways.<p>My point about profiling the exact user experience still stands. I can exactly instrument the hotspots in my code and fix them as needed I can disable ARC, I can avoid autorelease pools. (Or I can add my own autorelease pools or manual retains, preventing large objects from being freed until I'm outside of a hotspot.) Importantly, I know what's being profiled is <i>exactly</i> what will be run by my users. I can't say the same about GC code, since the collector must be free to reap whenever and however it decides. Heck, depending on the runtime, I can't even be certain which GC algorithm will be used by my customers.<p>I appreciate the control refcounting gives me, and I love that ARC makes writing refcounted code almost as painless as writing GC code without the loss of control.

The command line is a better way to learn Linux as opposed to the GUI.  How much have you really learned about Windows via the GUI?<p>First focus on getting the basics down.  Even the basics can get not so basic once you get deeper into the command line tools.<p>Bookmark some good cheatsheets for commands and then make a point to pick up something new in a few areas every day.  For example, you can pick up Vim in a couple of weeks but mastery is a lifetime journey.  The way to get better with Vim is to spend time every day learning something different and incorporating that into your workflow.  Otherwise you will never get far from being a beginner.  Many Linux tools are like that.<p>Don't worry about getting crazy with building your environment with Arch or Gentoo until you have become strong with the basics.  Also wait until you have a lot of time on your hands.  It's not an easy journey.  Better to start with something that you can be productive with right away.",1328263888

3674989,comment,3670660,3671708,1,0,phawk,,,"// PHP is the easiest to find hosting for, to setup and to learn.
If you don't have PHP installed, it's probably the hardest to setup, much easier to install Java, Ruby (rvm), node.js.
To learn, the easiest language is the one you already know. I do believe PHP is a good language to start on if you have had no prior development knowledge, starting out with C like syntax is always a good idea, but certainly would like to thing complete newcomers would prefer the weaker more dynamic syntax of Ruby / Python.
Hosting wise, yes pretty much every server on the web hosts PHP, with the rise of platform as a service though, PHP lacks behind the other platforms offerings because of it's non-existant package management. PaaS is definitely getting a lot bigger, and takes all of the effort out of server administration, for newcomers I'd recommend PaaS, the learning curve for Sys admin is too high at the start. And in reality, heroku is one of the best offerings, just pushing up a Java app with a small dependencies file and everything gets installed for you, love to see PHP do that in the future, but in reality it just doesn't.<p>- PHP is still the best at generating web pages.
What?!<p>- PHP offers all the tools needed to build strong 
applications (PHPUnit, xDebug, XHProf, ...)
Testing - PHP is probably the worst language I've ever written tests in, it is horrible compared to Ruby, Java, Node, Objective-C, C#. Other languages provider far better testing tools and debuggers. xDebug is horrible to setup compared to other languages where the debugger just works.<p>- PHP is not as bad as people like to say.
I agree with this point for sure, PHP 5.3 copes with most normal object oriented stuff, but so do all the other good languages for writing web applications, only the other languages have fantastic implementations, not ""not as bad as people think"" implementations. If this is one of your main points in recommending a language, that is shameful.",1331115592

This mediation can be lawyer led, but it can also be led by other professionals.<p>People with employment problems usually need to filter through any internal company policies before they go to law.<p>Rejecting pre-trial discussions is usually a bad idea.<p>Solicitors will tell you that going to law is a bad idea, and expensive, and will often not get the result you want.  I think, BICBW, that they need to do this as part of their professional codes of conduct.  They're tightly regulated, and encouraging people to go to law if they're unlikely to win is frowned upon.<p>Note that none of this is a barrier to effective law; once you need to go to law you've usually had several discussions with solicitors and you know what's involved and what to expect from your barrister.<p>There are separate tracks for quick and easy civil ""small claims"" cases, but even these can sometimes be avoided by using existing legal protections.  (The very consumer-friendly ""Distance Buying Regulations"" or the credit card protections, for example.)",1331115297

There is a big, strategic, complex, technology game going on and, apparently, a bunch of smart hackers think phones are like simple breakfast cereals (and even those aren't simple).<p>I also upvoted you, even though I don't think you're quite correct.
I personally don't believe that ""hackers (...) think that phones are like simple breakfast cereals"". Not that I'm a ""hacker"" or anything, but most of us HN-ers know how difficult is to ""make things just work"". Apple does that, ie ""making things just work"".<p>And, trust me, I'm not an Apple fanboy. I use a Windows 7 machine for development at work, all my websites are hosted on Ubuntu, and the only Apple products I own are my laptop and my phone.<p>I know it's only anecdotal, but until yesterday I was the very happy owner of an iPhone 3 (not even 3GS). Everything had been working just fine for the last 2  years, apart from a slightly decreased battery-life and Facebook's native app suddenly not working anymore, which was the moment when I realized that maybe it was time for an upgrade. What did I do then? I went straight into the store and bought an iPhone 4, because that way I knew for a fact that for the next 2-3 years I would have no problems in using my phone. I have no such guarantee from Android phones, even though most of them are similarly priced.",1331114783

8715117,comment,8714846,8715074,0,0,lemming,,,"From: <a href=""http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm#regulate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm#regulate</a> (copied here because I can&#x27;t add much more than this).<p>1. Limit what kind of behavioral data websites can store. When I say behavioral data, I mean the kinds of things computers notice about you in passing—your search history, what you click on, what cell tower you&#x27;re using.<p>It&#x27;s very important that we regulate this at the database, not at the point of collection. People will always find creative ways to collect the data, and we shouldn&#x27;t limit people&#x27;s ability to do neat things with our data on the fly. But there should be strict limits on what you can save.<p>2. Limit how long they can keep it. Maybe three months, six months, three years. I don&#x27;t really care, as long as it&#x27;s not fifty years, or forever. Make the time scale for deleting behavioral data similar to the half-life of a typical Internet business.<p>3. Limit what they can share with third parties. This limit should also apply in the event of bankruptcy, or acquisition. Make people&#x27;s data non-transferable without their consent.<p>4. Enforce the right to download. If a website collects information about me, I should be allowed to see it. The EU already mandates this to some extent, but it&#x27;s not evenly enforced.<p>This rule is a little sneaky, because it will require backend changes on many sites. Personal data can pile up in all kinds of dark corners in your system if you&#x27;re not concerned about protecting it. But it&#x27;s a good rule, and easy to explain. You collect data about me? I get to see it.<p>5. Enforce the right to delete. I should be able to delete my account and leave no trace in your system, modulo some reasonable allowance for backups.<p>6. Give privacy policies teeth. Right now, privacy policies and terms of service can change at any time. They have no legal standing. For example, I would like to promise my users that I&#x27;ll never run ads on my site and give that promise legal weight. That would be good marketing for me. Let&#x27;s create a mechanism that allow this.<p>7. Let users opt-in if a site wants to make exceptions to these rules. If today&#x27;s targeted advertising is so great, you should be able to persuade me to sign up for it. Persuade me! Convince me! Seduce me! You&#x27;re supposed to be a master advertiser, for Christ&#x27;s sake!<p>8. Make the protections apply to everyone, not just people in the same jurisdiction as the regulated site. It shouldn&#x27;t matter what country someone is visiting your site from. Keep it a world-wide web.",1418017869

There is no reasonable expectation on my part that I&#x27;m giving them money for a car ride AND ALSO giving them the information about me/my ride to use freely, regardless of what the TOS may say.<p>The expectation on the customer&#x27;s part is that ride remain private, much like anything that goes on in the doctor&#x27;s office. The reality, of course, does not match that expectation, which is why I think there should be some hypothetical oversight mechanism that manages the differences between the customer&#x27;s expectation and Uber&#x27;s reality.<p>Just because Uber has data on me doesn&#x27;t mean that I have given it to them to do whatever they want with it.",1418017857

So, with that in mind, I want to invite you to review it, because if it&#x27;s a reaction that considers the full details of the matter, I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t really pass the smell test, in my judgement.<p>You cite the failure mode of startups as a &quot;fact of life&quot; with regards to two particulars, and minimize the ethical responsibility of the hypothetical non-technical CEO on the basis of implied incompetence and his or her technical inability to do anything about the situation due to both his or her failure to plan for the eventuality and  the actions that he or she has just taken.  That leaves you with two &quot;that&#x27;s just how it is&quot; statements and one &quot;what can I [he] do about it anyways&quot; statement, lined up against one &quot;could this have been handled better? Yeah&quot; statement.  I believe you might agree that that looks like a pretty weak argument, on a second read; if not, I&#x27;m certainly interested in what you have to say about it.<p>If you&#x27;re the non-technical CEO of a subscription commerce company in this situation, did you mean to do anything wrong?  Of course not, no-one is going to assume that.  Does that mean you aren&#x27;t to blame and it&#x27;s not your fault and you&#x27;re not responsible for the situation because who knew startups were high-risk and computers are hard?  In the scenario you outline, it would not give me confidence in a person to hear that he or she believed such a thing.<p>More notably, though, and perhaps interestingly, the author mentions that it does not give <i>her</i> any particular confidence in &quot;Techstar&quot; as a brand.  Interesting because of the implicit assumption that the VC incubators are effectively vouching for the reliability of the startup and assuming a degree of governance / diligence with regards to the potential extremes of the outcome, which in turn raises the question of whether that&#x27;s an idea that the incubators are selling (perhaps unwittingly) to their prospective investments.  So, I think something like that might be more productive to talk about than situational ethics, really.  But I didn&#x27;t want to leave you with the mistaken belief that everyone had come to the same conclusions about the facts of life.",1418017255

If one were so inclined and knowledgeable, it&#x27;s almost possible to just telnet to port 1863 and use the raw protocol, in a similar manner to IRC. The only flaw today would be the fact that it&#x27;s plaintext, but were MS so inclined to do so, I believe they could&#x27;ve just wrapped it in TLS.<p>In comparison, the Skype native protocol is highly obfuscated binary, so the few reverse-engineering efforts that have surfaced thus far have not revealed all that much.

Why should we distrust Uber more than any other company? However, I STRONGLY believe that companies with data like Uber should be held accountable to very high standards and any breach of privacy of said data would result in severe penalties. This is not just an Uber problem, this is a big data problem and one many companies have.<p>I recently quit using Uber in favour of other services like Lyft because I do not believe in Uber&#x27;s lack of ethics and the way they do business.

You would have been done by now and ready to tackle some of the most interesting problems instead of continue to do same boring stuff you had been doing for past 2 years. In 2016, come back here and look at this comment again :).<p>PS: For people who are saying you can &quot;apply&quot; DNNs in a day or learn it by a coursera course in 6 weeks - they are only very superficially right. Yeah, anyone can build ML model for a sample training data using tool in the same sense that anyone can compile sample code and have a working app. The problem is that most models don&#x27;t work the first time as expected. The challenge lies in debugging the model and fix many of N possibilities to make it work. This is what working in ML is all about. It&#x27;s like usual programming where it takes years of experience to <i>debug</i> the code and make it work for your purpose. The added twist in ML is that debugging is almost entirely statistical. When your model doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t work only in statistical sense. Your problem would be essentially that the model doesn&#x27;t give expected answer this 12% of the time. For this 12% of the time, it doesn&#x27;t work not because of some wrong &quot;if&quot; condition or misplaced subroutine call. The debugging is almost always statistical debugging - there are no breakpoints to put or no watch to set or not even exceptions. So it takes pretty solid background in statistics and probability to effectively work in ML. And yes, most likely it would take much more than 2 years.",1418016008

8715029,comment,8714051,8714691,0,0,pcwalton,,,"Treating &quot;upgrades&quot; as a specific case of reflection, typically what happens is that the function that wants to do reflection declares that it wants to perform reflection on its arguments via the type system. For example, in Haskell this mechanism is called &quot;typeable&quot; and in Rust this is called &quot;any&quot;.<p>The nice thing about this approach is that it signals to callers that reflection is going to happen, so callers can be ready for it—the types become a form of documentation. If reflection is unrestricted it&#x27;s easy for callers to get surprised when methods are called that they didn&#x27;t expect. (Go has had breakage during point release upgrades from this, for example.)<p>This stricter approach requires that you plan ahead for &quot;upgrading&quot; in advance since you can&#x27;t change a non-upgradeable argument to an upgradeable one without changing the type signature and breaking your callers. On the other hand, your callers are secure in the knowledge that you won&#x27;t do that: they know that if you didn&#x27;t give them access to one of your type&#x27;s methods they can&#x27;t sneak around and get access to it through the &quot;back door&quot;. Non-upgradeable interfaces can also be more efficient since there is no need to store the reflection metadata at runtime; with this approach you only pay for what you use. Altogether it&#x27;s a classic static-versus-dynamic-typing tradeoff.",1418015785

Depending on how long it takes you learn how to hold those chords and change between them, you could come from having no clue whatsoever to playing something recognizably related to a girl coming round the mountain inside two hours, perhaps even less depending on your learning speed.\nI could then teach you the other remaining five major chords, as well as how chord progressions work (play the 1st, then 4th then 5th chord in any progression for example), and once you&#x27;ve mastered how to hold and shift between all seven (in a week? a month? three months?), I&#x27;d now have you coming round the mountain in seven different keys.\nThe advantage of this approach is that it gives you, the complete guitar/music novice, the satisfaction of being able to play something you and your dog recognize as music almost as soon as you start out.\nAre you an accomplished musician yet? NOT EVEN CLOSE. How far do you have to go? Very very far. Eventually, when you understand how music works in general and in particular on the guitar, you&#x27;ll get to see how and why I taught you those three first chords, and why a I, IV, V chord progression works but a I, II, III makes your dog go for a walk on it&#x27;s own. You&#x27;ll be able to build your own chords! You&#x27;ll even be able to argue with me about the correct name for some given chords! You&#x27;ll be able to play melodies from chords, maybe even play both chords and melodies at the same time! [0]\nSo, if you wanted to learn how to play guitar, would you want to first get a years worth of music conservatory work under your belt before you can belt out the simplest of tunes, or would you rather belt out &quot;Coming Round the Mountain&quot; in a few hours and then figure out later how she got round the mountain? Which one do you imagine will be more satisfying?\nI reckon it&#x27;s the same with programming. Python may not teach me how to write my own &quot;chords&quot; or enable me to get into arguments (valid ones) about stuff, but it enables me to do something visible almost immediately, and I can take pleasure and motivation from that initial success. Then as I go on, I&#x27;ll dig into how the stuff actually works and develop a better understanding, and this deeper understanding, just like in music, is a lifelong pursuit. Just as guitar masters are still learning, so are those of you who are, by any measure, programming masters.\nSo I&#x27;d say, if you&#x27;re teaching someone, or learning, start off with something where it&#x27;s easy to produce something tangible easily. Then develop a deeper understanding as your progress demands this deeper understanding.\n[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vCcZIARw9k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vCcZIARw9k</a>",1418014928

An F-16 with external tanks and combat loads (missiles and bombs) doesn&#x27;t turn as well an F-35.<p>The other big factual error is that Perre Spey seems to confuse program unit cost or total lifecycle cost with flyaway unit cost when comparing alternatives.

This makes trying to stabilize the price to some set of goods very difficult, because no matter what you pick, you&#x27;ll have to cut supply somehow, and that just won&#x27;t work without something akin to a central bank.<p>The internal measures, unfortunately, are very easy to game. Take, for instance, an option that is now being considered among academics for regular currencies: NGDP targetting. It&#x27;d be very easy to check the NGDP of a cryptocurrency: It&#x27;s really just trade volume. So it&#x27;d not be difficult to attach a coin&#x27;s supply increase to the volume. We could pick a currency&#x27;s codebase and make a competitor that did such targeting withing the day. The problem is that it would not work.<p>NGDP for a real country is fairly hard to game. It&#x27;s not as if I can suddenly create real economic activity without major costs to myself, at the very least in taxes and fees. The money is also spread enough that such effort would not really match rewards, even in an NGDP targetting regime. In a cryptocurrency though, it&#x27;s another matter. Transaction costs are tiny for large transfers, and someone with a large balance would be able to create large volume for pennies. Those that would have an easier time doing this are those with a lot of coin, which are exactly the people that would have a lot more to gain from currency manipulation.<p>I lack any mathematical proof that a stabilization system that is based on what a user cares about, expected value of the coin in a few months/years, is not possible. However I&#x27;d be very surprised if there was a solution that worked in the case that a few actors control a significant percentage of the coin&#x27;s supply, and as it is, this is a characteristic shared by every major cryptocurrencies today.<p>What makes things worse is that many cryptocurrency proponents would consider any of this stabilization mechanisms to be undesirable anyway. So even if we found a way, would the many people that believe that devaluation hurts savers be on board? A currency that did manage do behave a lot more like a traditional currency would probably not be what those people want, regardless of what the state of the art in economics believes.<p>So we are back to Betteridge&#x27;s law of headlines: Any headline which ends in a question can be answered with the word no.",1418014863

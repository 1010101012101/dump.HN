Unless you plan to return humanity to the most basic of existence, living day to day, scrounging, trying not to starve without reserves.<p>No regulation? Please point me to the industrial economy without financial regulations on any major specific thing.<p>What happened with the global financial meltdown was very obviously not due to lack of regulation. It was caused by the Fed encouraging reckless behavior by intentionally inflating asset bubbles as an attempt to accelerate recovery from the 2000/2001 recessionary economy.

Truth manifests in simple way - it is consistent.<p>People who are really interested in truth and people who are not (either because they delude themselves or want to con someone) have very different thought patterns, which are pretty well visible in the way they write (the skill to recognize these patterns is called <i>critical thinking</i>).<p>The consistency of the truth plays a big role - it usually means that people who are genuinely interested in truth try to build a consistent model, while con men are interested in criticism of the model on the fringes.<p>So one basic way to understand who is right, look if they have a consistent (and also refutable) model that explains the evidence.<p>Now for AGW theory in particular, there is no serious contender for a model that doesn&#x27;t show warming due to greenhouse gases. People interested in truth would love to have an alternative model, that explains the evidence, but the fact is, no one successfully came up with one. So perhaps one should accept that we have is correct.<p>You can also look at critics of the theory and see how they are inconsistent. Some critics admit there is warming, but disagree humans cause it. Some critics think that warming is due to the Sun. Some critics think that it&#x27;s too late to do anything about it. Some critics think that current warming is natural based on some cycles. And so on.. now all these opposing viewpoints are inconsistent with each other. Why they are inconsistent? Because again, the people raising the criticism don&#x27;t have a good model, that properly accounts for the evidence.<p>I suggest you actually go and learn a bit more what AGW theory (current best model explaining the data) is saying. Good way to do that is also to look at history of the model, because it also gives insight whether or not it is a con (the truthful models have complicated history of getting some things wrong at times, while bad models have no or very cartoonish history).

Mining and drilling have obliterated the natural resources of hundreds of millions of people around the world. That&#x27;s why oil spillage in Nigeria is called an environmental disaster.<p>> Essentially, isn&#x27;t this capitalism with all its fault lines? One way or another it can be got to work for everyone&#x27;s advantage.<p>Not when capital is turned into a commodity that has necessarily less value, which are then still traded on the market as securities with no regulation. Then you end up with scenarios in which political intervention is the only method for preventing the entire global economy from collapsing. That&#x27;s already happened once, which is evidence that this article&#x27;s fairly milque-toast thesis is correct.",1449926724

I don&#x27;t know what happened between him and his manager and team so I can&#x27;t say who or what was to blame. But I think he was put on a performance improvement plan (whether fairly or unfairly).

If you go on style, they have at least a chance of improving their style - assuming style really matters in a B2B context anyway.

Demography: Who is the ideal MBA candidate?  From what I&#x27;ve gathered, the historical answer would be: &quot;Someone from outside a business education about to move into a business role.&quot;  So, of course, your average MBA is going to be someone who studied Biology or Mechanical Engineering as an undergrad, right?  Well, they&#x27;re in there, but they&#x27;re surrounded by people who studied Business and Economics as undergraduates, often from elite schools!  What could a Wharton undergrad possible gain from a Wharton MBA?  Social proof?  A two-year vacation?  It&#x27;s unsettling, and it leads to the second problem.<p>2.) Intent: What sort of work is the MBA cut out for?  Well, they&#x27;re masters of administrating businesses, so...management?  Nope.  Consulting and banking.  Like lemmings, they go right off the cliff into these fields.  All of them.  Even the ones who came in there looking to simply move up the ladder in their chosen field, like biotech or energy, will feel pressured into becoming some sort of banker or consultant.  So, the MBA ends up becoming a launching pad for people outside of consulting and banking to get in, and for people on the inside to move up.<p>I don&#x27;t know how business schools would go about rectifying these flaws.  Even if they were to shut out business types, that second flaw is so deeply ingrained in the b-school ethos that anyone seeking to be a better manager in their original field would likely be derided by his or her peers as an underachiever.<p>Interestingly enough, I hear the Executive MBA is a far better experience, simply because the students are too far along in their careers to make a pivot into something else.  They&#x27;re just there to get better.  And maybe for the two-year vacation thing as well.",1376689852

6226836,comment,6224982,6224982,1,0,Futurebot,,,"Great article, and many good comments so far.<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at the core issue - the new core issue really: lack of jobs, which was touched on in the article. If we were in a situation where jobs were truly plentiful for everyone, we would likely not be having many of these conversations (or at least we&#x27;d be doing so with less urgency.) Aside from the fact that the costs at many schools are exorbitant, the simple fact is that degree or no, you&#x27;re still (and likely will continue to be) facing a job market with little on offer. Income-based repayment is a great step, but that does not help if somone remains unemployed - and even if they do get something - do these people study for 4-6 years in order to be a Barista?<p>About the suggestions that these people studied useless subjects: true, many of them did. What, however, would happen if they all decided to go into STEM instead? Assuming they all did amazing, we&#x27;d wind up with a glut of people with degrees in &quot;good&quot; subjects, which does nothing to magically create jobs (having a STEM degree does NOT mean you&#x27;re going to start a company!) - it only helps where there are shortages. Once those are filled, we&#x27;re back where we started (and wages may get pushed down due to a talent glut.) That&#x27;s the best case scenario, too. What would be worse? What would the reality likely be? If everyone did rush into STEM, a good portion would fail out (not everyone is cut out for it. Really, some people just do not have the attitude, mindset, demeanor, worldview, interest, etc.) and be left with no degree (or they&#x27;d switch to one of those useless ones) and still be debt - right back where we started again. For some real world examples, just look through some other discussions on HN about this subject about people in countries who DO exactly this and they&#x27;re stuck with unemployed and underemployed STEM grads up the wazoo.<p>So lowering tuition is great. Initiatives that allow income-based repayment or schemes to just make it free at the point of service and pay for it out of taxes are great, but <i>lack of jobs as the core issue</i> remains. For those of you who believe college should not be considered a job training program, that&#x27;s wonderful; it means, however, that people going into debt for a great education that does not get them a job is a terrible idea (and we should either move to a free system or tell people to just use MOOC and books.)<p>Either college is a job training program with high costs and horrible returns (and degrees are first-line filtering mechanisms for jobs), or it&#x27;s purely for edification and should be free. This world where we pretend it&#x27;s the latter, but know it&#x27;s the former continues to end for so many in nothing but tears.",1376688526

In fact, one can design a blind computer model that buys and sells stocks randomly, using pseudorandom numbers to make the decisions, and half the accounts will come out ahead of the averages, and a small number will do much better than the averages, just as in real life -- all because of chance.<p>More here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/equities_myths"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/equities_myths</a>",1376688254

You only have (a) so much time to ask questions, (b) so much patience from your audience/viewers/commenters, and (c) so much knowledge with which to sift/filter through the answers you get and decide what&#x27;s good/bad/etc. So given that your time is a valuable resource, you can&#x27;t waste it asking the most basic of questions (as you&#x27;ve done).

As likely a cause for the battery failing to take a charge is the fact that I often ran the netbook until the battery charge depleted to the point of shutting the PC down.<p>When I bought my current, pure sine, inverter I noticed that my new battery lasted nearly twice as long, but since switching to FreeBSD last year my second battery quickly bit the dust...<p>I&#x27;m expecting the present battery to last somewhere between one and two years, but I&#x27;m not taking that expectation to the bank.",1376687832

The entire basis of Google&#x27;s offerings is that they want to give you the most relevant search results possible, along with relevant ads.  If they cease giving you the best search results possible, they know that it opens them up to competitor providing a better product.<p>The far more likely scenario is that the car will direct you to the nearest supermarket, but also recommend a couple of shops nearby or on the way that it thinks you might be interested in.  If they direct you to a &quot;theater 25 miles away&quot;, then they know full well that someone else will come in and provide a better search product - in the long term they lose.<p>There may be privacy issues with Google, there may be issues with the prominence of ads, but claims that they don&#x27;t provide good search results are completely missing the point.",1376687814

Draw a line to your destination on the map and determine its angle with the north, say 25 degrees north-east.<p>2. Set your course at 25 degrees north-east and keep it constant.

Sequels of movies that did well in the box office, predictable plot outlines that have been proven to appeal to moviegoers, dozens of nearly identical films based on what has worked in the past -- this is good business.<p>Remember, film-making is not primarily an art form, it&#x27;s a business. The highest-paid, most respected producers and directors are those who stay within budget and create commercially successful films.<p>Want to change things? Stop paying to see typical Hollywood films. Go to small art theaters, or rent or buy small, well-reviewed independent films that won&#x27;t be displayed at your local multiplex. Don&#x27;t patronize mass-market theaters, instead acquire and see the sort of films only seen on college campuses and art houses.<p>Example -- do you want to see Scarlett Johansson in &quot;The Avengers&quot; or in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;? &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, a small-budget project written and directed by Sofia Coppola (Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s daughter), is an absolutely terrific film, well worth your time. &quot;The Avengers&quot; is pure eye candy, and a pretty good film as major action-film productions go, but it just can&#x27;t compare to &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;.<p>My point?

Graduating from a top tier (most of the time that means private) school will give the person a <i>tremendous</i> amount of leverage in their job search, and greatly increase their chances of landing a high-paying job.<p>What that means is that telling the students to &quot;just go to a lower-tuition school&quot; simply perpetuates the current class system and undermines social mobility.",1376687096

6226723,comment,6225565,6226437,3,0,jerf,,,"With a cooperative scheduler, you <i>will</i>, sooner or later, experience some form of starvation. The most obvious is the process that just infinitely loops, but less obvious situations will end up popping up too; calls that you thought were handled by the event loop but turn out to be blocking and add up when you start calling them at scale, strange behavior when you have a set of processes that turn out to yield far less often than you thought and the system starts behaving with much higher latency than it should if you get too many of them, and all kinds of such manifestations. There&#x27;s also the inability to create things that watch other things; if something does go spinning off into infinity, nothing else gets to run to kill it.<p>You can hack around many of them, but you eventually hit a wall, and the effort of the hack increases rapidly.<p>Note I didn&#x27;t really use gevent in this reply, this is just about cooperative scheduling. There&#x27;s a reason why we&#x27;ve all but completely abandoned it at the OS level for things we&#x27;d call &quot;computers&quot; (as opposed to &quot;embedded systems&quot; or &quot;microcontrollers&quot;, etc). I tend to consider cooperative scheduling an enormous red flag in any system that uses it... and yes, that completely and fully includes the currently-popular runtimes that use it.",1376687012

The problem is that the repayments are killing the spending power of the middle-class.<p>Where does paying back a loan or paying back a fixed amount of income differ?  Do you honestly think that the gov&#x27;t is going to curb the costs of education?  More than likely the gov&#x27;t will just jack the repayment % on future students.<p>So, like I said, it just kicks the can down the road.  No where in the Oregon plan is an outline of how to bringing state college costs back down to a reasonable level that doesn&#x27;t require loans except in extreme cases (where it was in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and even 90s).",1376686970

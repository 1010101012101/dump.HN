Notably, challenges are now intentionally separated by save points, so that a single skill-type is in focus during each unit.<p>That way someone who has trouble with, say, a vehicle section won't fail and be faced with five to ten minutes of run-and-gun before they can even attempt (and thus practice) the vehicle portion again.<p>Essentially, that's precisely what the OP's approach to education is: adding more save points and breaking up the challenges better by type: solo vs group, oral presentation vs written proposal, etc.<p>Further, failure penalties are only really used in games where the player has an open-ended amount of time to defeat the challenge, precisely to encourage learning and/or mastering of a technique or skill.  In a setting where the player has a time limit (such as in education) it would be unnecessary and inappropriate to additionally penalize failure as ""repetition + luck"" wouldn't be a valid strategy in the first place.",1294700220

2090050,comment,2089735,2089735,0,0,alexophile,,,"I've been thinking about this idea a lot lately - I think gamifying a single course could produce a modest boost in performance, but it seems like this particular implementation, as endtime pointed out, simply changes some names.<p>I think this would be a way cool system around which you could base secondary education.  But instead of the generic game parallels, you could treat the four years of high school as a sort of mash of character creation and early game exploration.  If you had 5 lines of progression (Math, Science, Social Sciences, Art, Language) that went from level 1-10, each requiring passing exams, preparing presentations, or completing projects, you could allow students to naturally find the work that pushes them personally.<p>The one big thing I think is necessary to really see the benefit of a game-like system in education is <i>the ability to try stuff multiple times.</i><p>Consider an alternate version of angry birds.  In this alternate version, there are 150 levels, many of which mirror the fun and challenging levels we know and love in the original.  The 150 levels are in 15 worlds, each with 5 practice levels and 5 ""test"" levels.  After playing the 5 practice levels as much as you want, you can play the 5 test levels all in a row, precisely once.  However you do, that's how you did.  That's your score.<p>Not a whole lot of <i>replayability</i> there.  While it can be necessary (especially at the university level) to distinguish between those who are and are not competant in a given field, I think game mechanics can teach us a whole lot more about how to make people <i>want</i> to achieve.<p>Additional thoughts:<p>- Unlockables could be really exciting i.e. you have silent study hall until you hit level 4 in any subject, at which point you gain access to the study lounge; if you're level 10 in at least 1 area, you can apply for off-campus lunch<p>- Incentives for tutoring would be cool. (Think ""Prestige Levels"")<p>- DATA!  Tracking these things would give unprecedented amounts of data that could provide a lot of insight into the way students are progressing through the material.<p>- For this to really work, you would have to develop a new system for scheduling courses in high school that more resembled a college.  <i>This is not a bad thing.</i>  I think giving high school kids a bit more autonomy in deciding how and what they go about learning with their time will produce more well-adjusted, mature adults.<p>- The specifics of how to implement a lot of these systems are less difficult than you think.",1294700158

[1]<p>Now, I'm relatively new to literate programming, and perhaps the answer to my question(s) will be obvious to someone more experienced with it. What I wonder though every time I read about it is, who is the intended audience of all this extensive documentation? More specifically, how much knowledge of the programming language and problem space do we presume that the reader has?<p>There is something elegant about presuming the audience has expertise in both areas. That way you only have to worry about documenting one thing, the program, rather than three things: the program, the programming language and the problem space. Readers lacking sufficient understanding of the lang or problem space can refer to the more robust documentation about either one individually to get themselves up to speed.

It fell down, went boom.<p>What went wrong:\n  - Timing -- We were either ahead of our market, so we had\n significant head wind making people realize that there was\n something there. Also, we hit the tail end of the boom, so\n round #2 of money was at a really bad time. \n  - Focus -- We had three projects, we should have had only\n one. Plus assorted other revenue generating consulting.\n  - Technical -- We made some unfortunate technical\ndecisions, and because of that wound up duplicating a lot \nmore infrastructure type code than we'd do today. We also \nwound up with version 2 looking just like version 1, but \nwith a much better data store. The 9 months that that took \nwould have been better spent making the user side better  \n  - Personnel -- Single founder, one under-experienced lead developer, and two other devs from completely different \nsoftware cultures who never meshed well. Any better team\nmembers would have realized that this was mildly disguised\nanarchy and beat someone into shape. I know I probably \nshould have been first in line.\n  - Sales and Marketing -- We were selling to non-profits. The sales cycle was long, sometimes approaching a year. If \n you have lead times like that, you need to be well funded\n and in for the long haul, not trying to piece stuff\n together and sell individual features for dollars.<p>Next time:\n  - Fringe platforms should be looked upon with suspicion. I'm not saying that you should avoid them, but had we even started with LAMP (or linux/apache/postgres/p-language), we might have had a fighting chance. Initial time to market was great, but I'd say that within 3-6 months, it was a drag. \n  - One founder is tough. He was way too split between fundraising, selling, and direction. Also, I mocked some of his code when I found holes in it, so he didn't really trust his technical ability as much after that. \n  - Developer compatibility is important. Mixing a MS alum, a debian developer, and someone who grew up on a fringe commercial platform is a recipe for disaster. \n  - Money -- Make it easy for people to pay you for stuff. Long billing cycles are awful. Long sales cycles are awful. One of my metrics for if a business has its shit together is if they can get invoices out fast and correct. \n  - Know when to quit. -- I hung on too long, because it looked like there was the littlest bit of hope, and I could deal with missing a paycheck here and there. Now, I'd probably have called it off a lot faster and gotten on with the next thing.<p>What now? I did consulting for a while till I found a job with the current company.

The cost of living in, say, South-East Asia isn't high. And your core customer base is sitting in the computer room in a hostel somewhere, looking for things to do and looking to share their experiences with others. Probably a carefully placed sticker will catch their eye. Or they'll be chatting to you at about all the places they've visited anyway. Maybe the hostel themselves will be so pleased at being listed on your website they'll stick up a ""rated on QTripper.com"" sign in reception. Don't underestimate the power of offline marketing.<p>Of course the cheap way to start off is going door to door in all the hostels in your own home city, assuming people travel there.<p>In terms of beefing up content, which apart from facts and figures your site currently lacks, checkout Wikitravel (CC-sharealike licensed) as a possible source for data if you haven't already. Even if it's just a temporary solution to your lack of content in many parts of the world it's a solution to the chicken-and-egg problem I think you're struggling with. Wikitravel bootstrapped by starting their country pages off with Wikipedia articles, incidentally.<p>To get more money coming in, improve your deal titles - ""Lightweight travel laptop at bargain price"" probably works better that ""Acer modelnumber...."" which just looks like a generic irrelevant ad.

Can't imagine the commissions being huge - but it's establishing the usefulness of your site as a hub for useful travel links some of which happen to pay you.<p>Encourage and incentivise signup.

If the Government was systematically underreporting inflation through the CPI then you'd hear about it outside of the conspiracy theory websites.<p>I'm sure you think people like Jim Rogers, Peter Schiff, Congressman Ron Paul, and David Walker (former US comptroller and head of the GAO which does most of the intergovernmental analysis you mention) are all crazies just like me.  No really, I <i>am</i> pretty sure you think that, so I won't bother to ask.<p>> Of course they do. Inflation is a very complex thing to measure.<p>That justifies adjustments (like seasonal, perfectly reasonable, which I did not mention), it does not justify wonky adjustments which hide inflation. As you said, only the headline numbers get reported by the mass media. It's all part of the confidence game. I'm not objecting to the confidence game, it has to be played especially considering our deficit situation, I'm only objecting to pretending the confidence game doesn't exist or doesn't have an effect on how the headline numbers are calculated.<p>> Incorrect - Housing is.<p>You're right, I was wrong on that. I was writing passionately and didn't check. It doesn't change my argument, though, even as the #2 expense food and energy inflation has a critical impact on how low-income families survive, or people on fixed incomes. No COLA for SS recipients 2 years in a row can really hurt if everything at the grocery store costs more. Maybe, with inflation so low as you claim, everyone's rents have gone down. I dunno, mine hasn't.<p>> You should read a little bit more about how this works instead of just copying from a buy gold website.<p>You should think a little bit more about how this works instead of just copying from Ben Bernanke's speeches. I suppose he is unbiased, though, and has no part in the confidence game.<p>> These numbers are all reported in the official statistics. It's all in the U-6 measurement which is released at the same time as the headline number, the U-3 measurement, that the news agencies pick up on.<p>Yeah, and you can still calculate growth of the money supply in the broadest terms (M-3) if you wanna do it yourself, the numbers are still there in the reports they just don't do the calculation for you anymore.  People are not gonna do this, they are gonna watch CNBC and hear everybody but Peter Schiff say ""everything's fine, don't worry about our deficits, don't worry about the fact that the largest creditor nation in the world has become the largest debtor nation, don't worry about the possibility of inflation from the necessity of monetizing the debt, I'm sure we can just tax everybody a little more or raise the retirement age and it'll be fine"" -- and then think that Peter Schiff is the crazy one.  (Just like me, I'm proud to say)<p>> Thanks for the anecdote - I'll stick to statistics thank you very much. And while food/energy prices have risen above the trend - housing has crashed 30% in the past few years. You can't just pick and choose which items to pay attention to.<p>Who's picking and choosing?  Yeah, housing has really come down. That's great for the millions of people who can't buy a house now since thankfully the lending standards have become sane again.<p>> What will help lower income Americans is a good economy. You cannot have a good economy with inflation running so low.<p>If your economy depends on inflation, sure. If your government and your population are in massive debt, inflation is VERY necessary to a good economy. Unfortunately inflation hurts lower-income Americans the worst, because a larger percentage of their income is spent on necessities.<p>> A lot of people inside and outside the Fed research inflation. This is just hysterical if you think it's a massive coverup.<p>I don't think it's a massive coverup. And I don't think there is a problem with inflation, RIGHT NOW. I think there could be a big problem with inflation in the near future if we continue with massive deficits, and yeah I'm a little worried about it. It took from George Washington to Ronald Reagan to amass the first trillion in debt. It took from there to GWB to get to ten trillion. Now with Obama we are adding over a trillion a year. I shouldn't have to explain the power (and the danger) of compound interest to someone on HN.<p>> Stop. This is the must illuminating of statements you made - You really don't understand how the financial system works. The Fed does not sell public debt: That would be The Treasury.<p>I didn't say the Fed sold public debt. I apologize for the hanging antecedent -- I meant that they (the government, including the Fed) have a bias to make things seem rosier than they are because it allows them (the government, including the Treasury) to sell public debt.  Don't deny that there is a confidence game going on, that the value of the dollar depends on people's confidence in its stability. Spending a couple trillion dollars a year more than you take in, and promising to spend tens of trillions in the coming decades to support people whose invested money you have already spent, is not conducive to stability.<p>> People buy U.S. Government Debt because it's backed by the taxpayers of the largest economy of the world. That's about as safe of an investment as there is.<p>An individual cannot survive spending more than he earns indefinitely. A business cannot survive spending more than it earns indefinitely. A government cannot survive spending more than it earns indefinitely, unless it can pull the wool over other countries's eyes indefinitely (China, Japan, the largest holders of US public debt) to allow it to happen.<p>I like this analogy by Peter Schiff:  imagine each country is a person on a deserted island. Everyone's job is to gather food for the American to eat, and every night they have a banquet where they bring all the food and the American eats it. Now, you could say, America is vital to this island's economy! Without him, none of the others would have jobs. The truth is, without him, they could do something else, gather more food for themselves or maybe relax on the beach. It's a gross oversimplification but it gets the point across -- just because China holds trillions of our debt and doesn't want to see the value of its holdings go down as the dollar goes down, does not mean they will continue to buy more dollars indefinitely and throw bad money after good. They have already started to pare this back.<p>Copy and paste off a buy gold website?  Hell, I could probably write one of those websites better than they could.  I'm wayyyy deep into the crazy. ""In times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.""<p>> Again. Inflation at 1.1%. Core inflation at 0.8%. There isn't a problem with inflation.<p>I don't have a problem with crack cocaine. I just crashed after my last high and slept for 48 hours straight. That's 48 hours I've been sober. I don't have a problem.<p>Inflation/borrowing allows politicians to give people things without paying for it, which gets them re-elected, unlike taxing which is politically unpopular. It's the perfect system. Spend whatever you want. Make a big deal about promising to be fiscally responsible in the future, but don't give it more than lip service. It won't be your problem when the consequences come knocking. Live on the high hog, it's a free ride, and all it costs you is mortgaging your grandchildren's future.

6597811,comment,6591299,6597100,4,0,tikhonj,,,"That&#x27;s really unfair to Haskell. What are things like Hoogle if not tools, uniquely[1] enabled by <i>Haskell</i>&#x27;s type system? All the basic IDE-like frills exist too, if you really want them. And now, with the advent of deferred type errors and holes, Haskell&#x27;s type system is getting even more interactive. The process is quickly moving from writing code and running it through a compiler to having an ongoing conversation with the typechecker as you build up your program.<p>More importantly, types can go well beyond catching errors or tooling. Types can actually make your code <i>more</i> expressive and they can push your design forwards.<p>For the first, the simplest example is with Haskell&#x27;s typeclasses: you can&#x27;t easily write something like Show or have something like Haskell&#x27;s flexible numeric literals without types. This allows you to grow[1] Haskell in ways that are even difficult in Lisp! For a more practical standpoint, I&#x27;ve found certain libraries to be much harder to reproduce without typeclasses, most crucially QuickCheck.<p>The second idea is slightly more abstract. As somebody else put it, types are like gravity sources: we place them strategically in our design space, and the rest of the code falls towards them. More concretely, coming up with the types to represent some domain often really helps in writing the code for it. Sometimes, once you&#x27;ve got the general framework of the types, the actual programming just feels like systematically filling in the blanks. More generally, the effect is nowhere near that pronounced, but the types do help shape everything else. In a sense, types help you constrain the set of possible programs at the outset, giving you fewer options to consider as you go along.<p>Oh, and I guess there&#x27;s the performance thing. This includes both low-level optimizations (C++ or even C-style stuff) and high-level ones (like rewrite rules). Optional type systems seem to give up on these as a matter of principle. I don&#x27;t believe static types are strictly <i>necessary</i> for good performance, but empirically they seem to help. Most languages with really good compilers are statically typed.<p>I think the idea that types just exist to catch type errors is one of the most unfortunate common misunderstandings about type systems. It really scares people away before they can learn about all the other benefits a good type system confers.<p>[1]: Okay, not really <i>uniquely</i>, but it&#x27;s close. I&#x27;ve seen Hoogle-like tools for OCaml but not for Java or C++, much less something like Python. I&#x27;m not sure how useful or general they could be for other languages.<p>[2]: Easily my favorite CS talk: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0</a>",1382521896

Also, the relational specification is much easier to get right than an optimized implementation.<p>It has also been extended to concurrent data structures:

This boss gains energy when shot, but loses when he releases a drone. You really shouldn&#x27;t shoot at it at all, just destroy its minions until he shrinks to zero. Hmmm, maybe this was a design error on my part, mixing deep thinking in a shooter game, I&#x27;m not sure?<p>As for the settings going back to main menu, you&#x27;re right, this is a bug. It used to work properly, but I refactored some code just before releasing and this got broken. I&#x27;m uploading a fixed version as I write this, it should be up in the Play Store in a couple of hours.<p>Having to pause shooting to Reload is deliberate. At first, there were no Reload button, but adding it added a dimension of difficulty to the game, and made it more interesting.<p>As for the package name... it&#x27;s complicated. As you can see in my blog at Day 1, I choose this name at first, and then I built a libGDX project using it. At some point when I finally decided on Drone Invaders name, I tried to refactor and Eclipse was not able to do everything. libGDX projects are set up by some kind of a setup wizard, that does some find/replace of strings and whatnot, so it seemed impossible that I would be able to do this manually. Although, not that I think of it, maybe I could create a new empty project using the wizard, and then copy all the source code there. However, I would lose all the ratings and stats I have so far on Google Play as it would be treated as a completely new game. :(<p>And I guess I will have to make e-mail clickable now ;)",1382521845

The ugliness of Microsoft Office. I dont see each version of M$ office were ever an improvement. While it did generate excitement, it wasn&#x27;t until someone who actually tired iWork to know how easy it is to do beautiful documents and charts. And to be it wasn&#x27;t until the Office 2k7 did they start to react ( But they got Ribbon in there which is an even bigger let off ). And although many improvement since then, those days i would remember how i am forced to use office.<p>To me, i see absolutely no heart and souls in those Microsoft Products. They aren&#x27;t well thought out, most of the time contradicting or even annoying. Purely in terms of user experience it was very bad.<p>And M$ was really rich. The Richest company at one point in time. That is not to say people hate the riches. It is merely a point that they have so much money why didn&#x27;t they go and fix things. Things that should have been done long long time ago. And as the Mac Vs PC ads have put it, they put so much more budget inside marketing then fixing bugs!<p>Their Business Practice is also a point of hate. Using Windows Monopoly to get rid of competing technology by including something similar of their own. Personally I have no problem with that. Honestly if the product offering from Microsoft were superior then people would use it anyway.
BUT THEY WERE NOT.<p>And there were a lots of other little things there and there that shows they are just a huge pile of mess.<p>Of coz Credit where credits due. There are amazing things Microsoft did. Microsoft Research for instance, i saw the presentation on real time voice recognition and translation. And many other things from Microsoft Research as well. Xbox 360, from PS3 prospective were quite good ( not great, but good ).

It&#x27;s perfectly possible for a company to have non-profit-maximizing strategies, especially in the short term. The founder might have some personal ethics regarding how a business ought to be run, or they might want to project a certain brand image, or they might be interested in maintaining a positive/motivating work environment even if doing so costs some clients or requires paying employees above-market, etc. As you note, fiduciary duties are much more specific. For example, screwing over minority shareholders in certain ways would be a breach of fiduciary duty; accepting investment under false pretenses may be as well. Simply running a company in a suboptimally profitable way, because it&#x27;s how you prefer to run the company, is not. There are other mechanisms in place for handling disagreements over those kinds of things, such as investors demanding seats on the board in return for their investment, in which case they could vote to overrule your decisions (or replace you entirely, given enough seats).<p>To take a high-profile example, Chik-fil-A chooses not to open any of its stores on Sundays, because the owner believes the Sabbath should be a day off work.

A lot of people seem in this thread seem to think he didn&#x27;t, but as far as I can tell from the indictment it&#x27;s pretty explicit that he did and I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s disputed by either side.<p>2) Was his intention out of malice (intention to steal trade secrets), stupidity or something in between.<p>The first is the point I&#x27;m making without commenting on the second.",1382519162

I am a Spaniard working in the Netherlands for a few years now, paying high rents and being far from family and friends. I could live in Greece (where my wife is from and where we have a fully paid house) but unfortunately there are almost no tech-related jobs there. As a web developer almost 100% of what I do on a daily basis could be done remotely. I wonder if remote work could be the solution for thousands of people like me who have to leave their countries just to find a job.",1382519123

Planning and executing is a hell of a lot easier than firefighting through a storm of finger-pointing and blame-shifting. Once things have gone wrong, most people involved lockdown and stop being helpful for fear of being seen as the one who made it go wrong. Managing <i>that</i> is a rare skill.<p>Ideally no one would risk projects going awry by employing &quot;average&quot; project managers and then having a single &quot;rockstar&quot; guy to sort out the mess if they do go wrong.

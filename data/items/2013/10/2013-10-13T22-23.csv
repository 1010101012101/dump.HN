Writers have peer review workshops (like Clarion <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_Workshop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_Workshop</a> which is for aspiring scifi/fantasy writers) they have editors who know how to make a good idea better, clearer, etc.<p>Don&#x27;t worry that your writing isn&#x27;t great.  Get the ideas out, hammer out a story, don&#x27;t prematurely optimize.  Refactoring is something you&#x27;ll do later.  But definitely write every day, or at least sit at a desk.  You won&#x27;t know what to start with... If you are idea based, you will probably lack for characters, plot, scenery.  Don&#x27;t worry, you can work on that as you go.<p>But fundamentally, write, then write, then write some more.",1381705150

Best of all, it is public and motivating. I agree that it is hard to do something highly valuable on a green field project everyday, so I often work through exercises from textbooks (right now I am in the middle of SICP) to fill in days when I would otherwise just be directionless. I used to feel guilty for not &quot;doing enough&quot; to advance my career, and would &quot;binge code&quot; whenever the guilt built up too much, but now I feel so much more confident and relaxed, knowing I&#x27;m putting in a sustainable amount of high quality reading and practicing every day.",1381705148

I can&#x27;t imagine loving one and not the other. I do sympathise with the wish to see a practical application. I have a distinct recollection of an ah-ha moment for me, at about 15 years of age. We were being taught basic calculus. The idea was introduced that a function f(x) could be used to represent the yield of some industrial process. You put in x, you get out y = f(x). So far, so obvious, so boring right? But then came the cute part; If you can calculate the derivative of f(x), you get another function f&#x27;(x) which is the slope of f(x) for any value of x. Then to find the maximum yield you seek the value of x where f&#x27;(x) = 0, because the slope of f(x) will be zero &#x27;at the top of the hill&#x27;.<p>I guess it&#x27;s a personal thing, but for me this fired my enthusiasm for both learning the various techniques for differentiation, and for equation solving. Then integration followed as simply reverse differentiation [amazing - one is the area under the graph - one is the slope of the graph - why should they be opposite ? Because maths is beautiful is the short answer - a universe of discovery is the long answer]. Around this point maths became fun, the work part evaporated. Later I got interested in computation because you can&#x27;t always differentiate or solve equations analytically (with pure math), but you can do it numerically, to any desired degree of accuracy with a computer.",1381704547

6544423,comment,6543182,6544297,3,0,Perseids,,,"Quite interestingly, the axioms mathematics is build upon do <i>not</i> let you decide every question that you might come up with. As such in mathematics not everything is black or white. For example, the continuum hypothesis is <i>independent</i> of the most commonly used axiom system <i>ZFC</i>. To explain what that means imagine ZFC would be describing an apple. Out of the definition of &quot;apple&quot; you can get theorems that tell you &quot;if you start on any point of the apple and dig down in a straight line, at some future point in time you will reach the &#x27;other side&#x27; of the apple&quot; or some statements you can disprove &quot;if you walk on the surface of the apple in a straight you will never come back to point where you started&quot;. What you will not get is the colour of the apple. Everything you know about the apple is consistent with it being green. But all that is also consistent with it being red. The colour of the apple is independent of everything that you are interested in in an apple. Therefore there is no reasonable answer to the question &quot;which colour does the apple have&quot;, except maybe: It should not matter. The same is true of the continuum hypothesis. I remember reading that if you need the CH to prove something, then you should definitely reconsider the statement you are trying to prove :).",1381704342

There are passages that are linked to the waxing and waning of the moon and that gives us the sense of the months. There are similarly seasons that suggest years. But we have gotten very good at media and riling people into heightened emotional states, to attempt political change. And that ability to tap into emotion short-circuits our understanding of time. So where we would usually go through--to throw out a number--5 emotional upheavals very closely linked to time between each technological innovation, now there are several artificially induced emotional responses that are completely unlinked from time, and we have no true sense of the amount of time that technological upheaval now takes.<p>It is not possible that technology is progressing slower now than before.

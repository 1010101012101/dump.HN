180508,comment,180311,180435,0,0,whyleyc,,,"Thanks - I got a basic Nginx config up and running on EC2 within a couple of hours. I'm intrigued by the idea of using it in combination with HAProxy though, so wondered if you didn't mind a few follow-up questions ? Essentially:<p>- Do you run the two products on the same physical machine ?<p>- What does Nginx do that HAProxy doesn't ? (i.e. why not just stick with HAProxy ?)<p>- I noticed that Nginx has some weighting options for load balancing (see <a href=""http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxLoadBalanceExample"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxLoadBalanceExample</a>). Are these just not sophisticated enough for your needs ?",1209859155

180505,comment,180384,180384,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I think this means a lot of people have jobs that require a fixed number of hours (say, 40 hours a week and 50 weeks a year) in exchange for a fixed amount of money.  Americans may feel the number of hours is too high, but their wage per hour is fine.  Basically, Americans work too many hours, and therefore would like to buy hours back.<p>E.g. Someone makes $100,000 on 5,000 hours per year.  They can't work less than 5,000 hours, or they'll get fired.  Their wage is $20 per hour.  However, working 5,000 hours a year is painful and the dude doesn't need to spend $100,000 a year. He would happily buy back time at $20/hour.  If a genie offered him free money or an equivalent amount of free time (with a $20/hour exchange rate), he'd take the free time.",1209858868

180503,comment,180176,180413,0,0,aswanson,,,"I think what he is saying is that the generation and extraction of concepts requires context that language may or may not provide.  If you think about the approach of AI with language, it is almost the opposite of how humans learn:  presentation of grammatics/language first and the extraction of concepts from this, whereas humans learn basic concepts of reality before speaking, and language is a partial representation of what they know.",1209858817
180502,comment,180214,180487,0,0,shafqat,,,"thanks for the tips. i guess the weird thing about our situation is a lot of VCs have contacted us. we're super early stage and weren't explicitly looking for funding. but as a result, we've had some awesome meetings and built some really good relationships. is it weird for VCs to contact entrepreneurs directly without referrals?",1209858799

I think you have a better chance of guaranteeing a routine works when you can inspect what it's actually doing below the hood. Something like MATLAB is based completely on trust (albeit, deservedly).",1209858709
180500,comment,180214,180338,0,0,shafqat,,,"Thanks.. I wouldn't ever try and fake it. All the interest we have is real (we haven't gone after funding yet, all the VCs have contacted us) as I mentioned before, I'd rather not get involved in tactics. Always better to let the product do the talking. But appreciate the fact that I shouldn't explicitly give names.",1209858607
180499,comment,179359,179428,0,0,nertzy,,,"I'd be surprised if they use the X for anything other than simple hiding.<p>This was a feature I was pretty interested in about two years ago. I spent some time trying to use the pre-Application-Platform API to build it out myself, but there were too many limitations on the FQL querying API.<p>At the (relatively small) Facebook developer party at SXSW in 2007 I talked with one of the Facebook employees about wanting this feature, and he said they had it working internally, but that they faced similar problems with the user experience; for instance, they would get all of the people they know well but hate.<p>I imagine that they held back from releasing it until they came up with the ""X"" dismissal feature so that users wouldn't have to be continually annoyed by their enemies.",1209858450

180488,comment,180311,180311,0,0,rcoder,,,"I've been using Apache 2.2 with mod_proxy_balancer to do load balancing for PHP and Rails apps for over a year now, and had pretty good experiences with it. Since I support a lot of existing Apache servers, the configuration is easy for me to work with, and the ability to do authn/authz and SSL termination at the load balancer lets me keep the load down on my application servers.<p>It's probably not as fast as Nginx, but I haven't found our load balancers to be a bottleneck. In fact, we've been doing load balancing on a pair of really, really wimpy servers (Celeron CPU and 512MB of RAM) running Apache on OpenBSD  for about a half-dozen different apps for the last year, and never seen the average load climb up over about 0.5, even while handling upwards of 300 requests per second.",1209856821
180487,comment,180214,180214,0,0,timc,,,"so i'm a VC and i don't bother to ask that question.  there is no value in asking that and not a question you want to answer IMHO.  Most important is to get referred into a VC if possible from someone who trusts you and who the VC knows well.  VCs are a lot more frank with a trusted referrer usually than they are with the entrepreneur and the referrer can signal that the deal is getting traction.  That seems to matter, probably too much, to most VCs.",1209856795

We use healthchecks on our production machines, which means a consistent rate of hits every few seconds, 24/7. After about 3 months, Pound had chewed up 1.7GB of RAM, which caused memory usage alerts in our monitors.<p>Not a big deal -- you can always restart the process -- but I'm still evaluating alternatives.",1209856536
180483,comment,179906,180444,0,0,lux,,,"In my experience, honesty is your friend here :)  I had a contract that we took on which inherited someone else's codebase as a starting point, but it sounded simple enough.<p>When we realized it was getting not-so-simple we had to decide whether to go back to the client and explain that it's going to be more than we thought, or whether to just push through and go over a bit (false coder heroism...).  We decided to push through.  Turned out that just made things even worse and we would need even more time to fix it now.<p>We were also busy with another big project at the same time, so we were focused more on that as well.  So things dragged on.  Finally, I had to have a meeting with the client where I could make something up or simply tell them the truth.  I opted for the truth (that would be my dad's influence :).<p>I was pretty scared it wouldn't work, but they accepted my apology and the plan to correct it, which did require more time and money to complete.  I felt like I had dodged a bullet.  We managed to sort everything out in the end, learned our lesson, and they've since recommended us to several other companies because they feel they can trust us.  And it feels pretty good to have earned someone's trust that way too.<p>Anyway, I write way too much on here...  (gotta learn to edit! ;)  But good luck with your project, hopefully you'll have the same luck I did!",1209856383

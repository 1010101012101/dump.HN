But it is important to acknowledge that trade-offs exist, and foolish to ignore them. The cost-benefit framework is useful for the reason that it forces people to look at the trade-offs.<p>It is foolish to give infinite value to the benefit of preserving nature. If we are willing to preserve nature <i>at any price</i>, then we ought to shut down industrial civilization, kill off 5.8 billion people, and go back to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. However, few people think that cost would be worth the resulting benefits to the environment.<p>Ignoring the costs of environmental activism is short-sighted. Environmental restrictions are not free. They cause real deprivations. We ought to acknowledge these deprivations and consider whether or not they are worth the benefits, even if there is no objective ""right"" answer.<p>Sometimes we will decide environmental rules are worth it. Banning CFCs was probably a smart idea. Sometimes, however, we will decide environmental rules are not worth the cost.

What factors are you taking into consideration? Aesthetics? Health? How much money is clean water worth to you? Or, from a CBA standpoint: is it worth pouring a gallon of paint into your drinking water, or is it better to transport that paint to a remote facility which will handle it in some fashion? And in that one relatively minor decision alone, how many different factors are you going to account for? The size of your drinking water supply, the chemical composition of the paint, the ecology of your drinking water supply, the distance to the waste managing facility, the vehicle used to get it there, the methods the facility uses to handle it ...<p>This CBA hand-waving is bullshit. It's impossible to take <i>all</i> costs into account for this kind of stuff. Most people -- even the most knowledgeable climate scientists -- don't even know what all the costs are.

It will cost me a great deal of effort to remove it. But, it still does help to accomplish my goal: the next time I visit that place, the trash won't be there (nor will it be there for the next visitor). Thus, I will remove it, if possible.<p>Is that not a rational decision-making process? Does that not make sense from an environmental standpoint, as a species?",1238101583

I was expecting from the domain name that it would only be able to search for men.<p>I like how it automatically knew to put Waterloo as the city.<p>Some things to improve:<p>* Show results first.<p>* You need to be useful to the user first. If you can do it without asking for anything in return then even better.<p>* Take the drop.io model. Upload and go...no user info required unless they want to offer it.<p>* Get rid of the sign up. You want to make money 2nd and get users first. So no signup. Make it free then add value added services to service your members.<p>* Make it even more niche. Up to you how to do this.<p>* Focus on only a few major cities. Make it clear where you operate.<p>* Hook into other services - plentyoffish. They may not like this. But do it then deal with it. Afterall both you and they get exposure. Don't steal their users though. Remember your goal is to be useful to the user not yourself.<p>* If their match is somewhere else lead them there. Offer them to give you their email and you can help them more in the future.<p>Good luck",1238101505

We have 50 different sets of state contract law and precedence to deal with (unlike your 13 superior courts to watch) and a larger amount of interstate commerce and contracts to be handled.  Compounding the problem is that fact that state laws regarding contracts can vary quite widely.  While some companies may wish to restrict jurisdiction to states that have a pro-business bias this is less of a factor than you might think (companies sue each other far more often than consumers sue companies) and what most companies are looking for is a single standard to use for the contract.  No one wants to learn the hard way that some state changed a law six months ago which completely hoses you for liability or contract enforcement and if a contract could not specify a jurisdiction then companies would be forced to stay up to date on new legal precedents and new legislative efforts in all fifty states.<p>You can try to change the jurisdiction, but it is hard to do this for a very specific reason.",1238101404

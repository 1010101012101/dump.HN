There have been many times when I'm watching a film or playing a video game where I support the antagonist. Often the 'evil' character is the most dynamic one, the person responsible for actually moving the plot along. Villains act, heroes react after all.<p>Now I say this not to just engage in trivial nitpicking, but because I think his thesis needs to be refined. The author attributes his idea to a moral compulsion for people to support the 'good' company, or the one thats trying to slay a monster. What he's actually identified is the natural tendency for people to define themselves in opposition to the other. You can't be insanely loyal to a product unless there is a challenge to it.

There is the potential of failure due to race conditions, but IMHO it's not as bad as it's often made out to be.<p>For high concurrency, there is of course the question of what level in the stack you want to handle the concurrency at.  There's not much use to <i>doing</i> 5000 things at the same time.  But you might want to <i>handle</i> 5000 things at the same time (say, open sockets).  The question is how much you want to twist your code around to do this -- with threads you might have worker pools, and you might have to be sure your chunks of work are of reasonable size (and often it's tricky to do some things incrementally).  With cooperative concurrency... well, you do all the same things ;)  But sometimes when threads are enough you don't have to contort your code, and in some error cases threads will help a lot (like you happen to not partition your work sufficiently).<p>I really just want to get rid of those tweaky code things for all cases, so that it's not a matter of these different choices with different tradeoffs, but just one really good choice that applies much more widely.",1301949748

Before libevent, I used ACE_reactor to accomplish the same tasks. I prefer libevent (strongly) to ACE. I might prefer libev to libevent, but... why bother? Libevent works fine.<p>My guess about ""limitations"" of libevent is that it's primarily that libevent is anchored to global state and needs to own the event loop for the program. So, for instance, to get it working in Cocoa apps, I have to spawn off a libevent thread. And I can only have one of them.<p>But this isn't really a big deal for me; once I got the libevent thread working, everything was peachy for me.<p>In no other context do I ever, ever have any need to do anything funky with how I include libevent; 90% of programs that use libevent are designed from the outset to use libevent and don't benefit from flexibility about the event library.",1301949559

Be aware that people on manual billing (in my experience, anyway) tend to treat it like the cable bill - something they feel have a couple of weeks to pay. They never seem to catch up, either (e.g. 'I just paid that two weeks ago', oblivious to the fact they were two weeks late).  And if you hammer them with billing reminders, they tend to tune out, and eventually miss that inevitable termination notice.  I've had so many customers on manual billing passively cancel over the years (i.e. stop paying, not respond to emails) and then reappear out of the ether months later that I now wait at least six months to completely wipe their account data.<p>Manual billing also forces customers to consciously reevaluate whether it's worth paying for your service every time they log in to pay a bill.",1301949553

If I did do that, it would probably be as an optional library (specified at build time), providing a fallback in the same way I intend to provide a fallback for browsers which don't provide an implementation of CSSMatrix. The other possibility would be to embed a minimal animation library like mile [1], and just use that directly.<p>The other way of doing this would be to pull Firmin into more general DOM libraries as an alternative animation backend, and toggle between them based on runtime feature detection (for an example of how to do this, see [2]).

Or you might have sudo and ssh set up to not require passwords, in which case you won't be prompted at all.)<p>That's it! Now your local machine can access the remote network as if you were right there. And if your ""client"" machine is a router, everyone on your local network can make connections to your remote network.<p>You don't need to install sshuttle on the remote server; the remote server just needs to have python available. sshuttle will automatically upload and run its source code to the remote python interpreter.<p>This creates a transparent proxy server on your local machine for all IP addresses that match 0.0.0.0/0. (You can use more specific IP addresses if you want; use any number of IP addresses or subnets to change which addresses get proxied. Using 0.0.0.0/0 proxies everything, which is interesting if you don't trust the people on your local network.)<p>Any TCP session you initiate to one of the proxied IP addresses will be captured by sshuttle and sent over an ssh session to the remote copy of sshuttle, which will then regenerate the connection on that end, and funnel the data back and forth through ssh.<p>Fun, right?

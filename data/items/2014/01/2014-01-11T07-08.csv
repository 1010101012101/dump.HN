With the advent of electronic learning—including low-cost computer courses and online courses that can reach thousands of students around the world—there is more market competition than ever.</i><p>Rule #1, don&#x27;t ask a (rhetorical) question you don&#x27;t know the answer to.<p>Suppose universities were able to extract the full-rents from all future profits that their educations provided? And made from this data &quot;new benchmarks assessing their worth&quot;. Who&#x27;s to say tuition prices would not actually go up?<p>Second, online moocs (most likely) do not provide competition for universities, when measured by the above metric. The largest, most outsized asset when all is said and done is not &quot;expertise&quot; or &quot;education&quot;, but trust. The latter two are just proxies for the former. In fact, they are valuable precisely because they are &quot;trust me&quot; proxies.<p>A good example of this is Valerie Jarret. She is a high-level confidant of the POTUS who most objective observers don&#x27;t regard as overly qualified in any particular area of policy expertise. But she has her job, and its broad portfolio, because she is someone that the POTUS trusts (aparently to a large extent).",1389426952

Knowing that not every one offered a position will accept it, the recruiter tells all of them they&#x27;ll be given an offer. That way those candidates are less likely to accept an offer elsewhere and &#x27;stay in the pool&#x27;. Recruiter offers the position to two and waits to see if they accept. If either doesn&#x27;t accept, they make an offer to the next candidate. In this case, the spots filled before getting to all of them. Since they had been told they would receive an offer but no spots were left, the recruiter decides to end all contact.<p>If they were more honest, they would have to give offers to only two. The others candidates are likely to move on while the recruiter waits for a response.

Small assumptions can create big differences.\nIf you can&#x27;t guarantee that the data has actually been written to the disk then you&#x27;re testing caching mechanisms, something you already point out in your article, but then you&#x27;re no longer testing file system performance as the article claims it is benchmarking. The problem is that we don&#x27;t even know which caching mechanisms (guest OS, hypervisor, hard disk driver) or that the conditions are always the same.<p>A typical thing that performance benchmarks do to negate guest OS caching is to process significantly more data as what the available RAM is set to. For example, if your guest OS RAM is set 512MB, process 10GB of random data. Of course then the question is how-to get random data as you don&#x27;t want to end up testing the random generator ;) or your host OS caching.<p>Another way to make sure you test data committed to disk could be to include a &quot;shutdown guest OS&quot; part and measure total time until the guest has been fully shut down.<p>I know that at least VMware has the ability to turn off disk caching (in Fusion, select Settings, advanced &quot;Hard Disk Buffering&quot; <- disable). \nI am not aware of a similar feature in Virtual Box, it might exist though.<p>Even while you tested the same guest OS, we don&#x27;t even know if the hard disk adapters where both using the same hard disk drivers. \nPerformance differs between IDE/Sata/SCSI drivers.

I.e., redundant power and multi-provider network connectivity with multiple connectivity points that have a massive capital cost but will be as reliable as your commercial or home utilities.<p>Couple the cost of establishing the relationship (especially with startup credit) with the NRC and MRC of hosting services, smart hands rates, reserved cabinet or cage space for those surprise boxes on the dock, and incremental pricing models, and it&#x27;s very difficult to build out and manage poorly predicted growth in a financially constrained environment.<p>Saving money on this means you&#x27;re allocating additional engineer hours to dealing with this yourself.<p>The &#x27;middle road&#x27; is probably an operator in a decent NAP or superNAP that manages the big lease and then carves out a margin by offering smaller space, possibly even colocating your hardware in the same rack as someone else&#x27;s (and maybe not in the same rack with your other gear), and charging more than a macminicolo but offering significantly improved and variable services.<p>There are a number of walls you can hit that will present themselves as an almost insurmountable obstacle when you own your own gear.  There are mandatory professional services when setting up some gear (SAN vendors have been notorious for this) and it&#x27;s just a bunch of <i>attention</i> you have to devote to something for which there is generally a good enough solution for a company that may not exist long enough to depreciate the servers that ate a huge amount of their startup capital.<p>It&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re &#x27;afraid&#x27; of computers.

7041930,comment,7038242,7038242,2,0,r0h1n,,,"A somewhat different perspective exists in India. Most large corporations (and a large number of startups too) dissuade people from eating at their desks. Because most Indians love and eat cooked food, which, well, tends to give off the odours of cooked food. An entire floor eating cooked food at their desks will inevitably lead to a lingering odour that settles over everything & everyone.<p>So many of us have two options - eat out at a nearby eatery, or eat your prepared lunch at the internal cafeteria.<p>Personally, and in my circle of friends, we&#x27;ve gone from preferring eating out to preferring eating cooked meals that are either bought at the cafeteria or brought from home.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s our preference for cooked food, which after a few years of eating out, will always be healthier if you get if from home. And because many of us have the &quot;luxury&quot; of being able to hire cooks who come in the mornings/evenings.<p>There are of course many Indians who prefer eating out, but as they get older (read: 4-5 years of working), they start realizing that home-cooked food is a better proposition. Which is why you&#x27;ll often find a broad cross-section of employees - from an entry level person to CXOs, bringing cooked food in insulated containers as lunch.",1389424749

We&#x27;re a couple of developers, when we launched four and a half years ago we had little to no marketing knowledge. So I have learned by experimenting.<p>We launched into an audience we knew well, and already worked for. The product is pitched at web designers, as a consultancy the majority of our clients were web design agencies. Our main initial tactic - and something we still do - was to write content that appealed to that audience. Not necessarily anything to do with content management, but anything that might appeal to designers and design agencies and then link back to Perch.<p>I&#x27;ve experimented quite a bit with BuySellAds (<a href""http://buysellads.com"" rel""nofollo"">http://buysellads.com/</a>). There are bargains to be had that convert well if you look at the smaller sites, and find those that are well matched to your audience. They might not send through huge amounts of traffic but if they are really well selected then the conversion rate can be better than the expensive high traffic sites.<p>The surprising success for us in terms of advertising has been sponsoring relevant podcasts. In our case that is podcasts that target web designers. The trick is to sponsor those who actually take the time to talk a bit about the product during the show - rather than just read out your name at the beginning. We&#x27;ve also managed to find podcasts where the hosts use Perch - that&#x27;s even better!<p>Mostly it is just working on incremental gains in terms of traffic and visibility. An article here and there, some well placed ads, sponsoring podcasts. None of this causes a crazy rush of traffic but we&#x27;re in it for the long game, so a steady growth that is sustainable is really more interesting to me.",1389424569

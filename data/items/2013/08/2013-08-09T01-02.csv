6183241,comment,6183059,6183059,37,0,scarmig,,,"Convenient, maybe, but prematurely shutting down secure email because you anticipate the government will come out to get you effectively does the government&#x27;s job for it.<p>Albert Hirschman wrote a famous book called &quot;Exit, Voice, Loyalty&quot; about different styles of responses to conflict. Different strategies are certainly called for in different situations. But most exit strategies (outside of suicide) rely on retreats to spaces outside the sphere of influence of the conflict initiator.<p>The existential space of the Internet is not the infinite, however. Although a nurturing environment for human freedom, it&#x27;s also a fragile ecosystem, and giving up on a couple key nodes, in its current form, is enough to destroy it, shadowy dreams of darknets notwithstanding. When freedom retreats from all Internet spaces in the USA, that is plausibly more than enough to kill it as a haven for freedom anywhere.<p>It&#x27;s not the end of freedom or anything like that: maybe it&#x27;s strategic to retreat to spaces more decentralized and harder to compromise than the Internet, and other fights can be fought and won in those. But that&#x27;s not a gamble I want to make, especially because the fight for Internet freedom hasn&#x27;t been lost yet! Not by a long shot.<p>ETA: This came off harsher than I anticipated: I had no idea that Silent Circle is a project of Phil Zimmerman. Damn, that&#x27;s dispiriting. Time to pop open a beer.<p>ETA2: Yeah, I think I jumped to conclusions about their central motivation and shouldn&#x27;t have implicitly doubted as much their stated reasons. Boo me.",1376013553

Since there are better structures in place to explicitly control the layout of memory, you can do things with freepools, etc, that take pressure of GC.<p>For high-performance things like the systems I had to build at Google, I don&#x27;t know how to make things work in the high percentiles without bringing explicit memory management into the picture. Although it makes me feel like a hax0r to talk about doing work like that, the reality is that it adds 50% to dev time, and I think Go/Clojure/Scala/Java are an acceptable compromise in the meantime.<p>It is possible to build things that minimize GC churn in python/ruby/etc, of course; I don&#x27;t want to imply that I&#x27;m claiming otherwise. But the GC ends up being slower in practice for any number of reasons. I&#x27;m not sure if this is true in javascript anymore, actually... it&#x27;d be good to get measurements for that, I bet it&#x27;s improved a lot since javascript VMs have received so much attention in recent years.<p>Final point: regardless of the language, splitting services out behind clean protobuf/thrift/etc APIs is advantageous for lots of obvious reasons, but one of them is that, when one realizes that sub-service X is the memory hog, one can reimplement that one service in C++ (or similar) without touching anything else. And I guess that&#x27;s my fantasy for how things will play out for my own stuff. Ask me how it went in a couple of years :)",1376012278

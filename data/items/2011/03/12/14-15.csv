I have the last gen of core-duo with 8GB and the 250GB SSD and after playing with one of the latest models I decided to forgo this refresh and wait for the next.<p>While there is definitely a noticeable difference, it really was not enough for me to chuck down another 4 grand for a top of the line MBP 17. I think if someone already has a last gen like the authors machine he was replacing, they may get more bang for their buck by upgrading the 4GB to 8GB and swapping in an SSD.<p>I use mine for pretty much the same uses, lots of virtuals that run all of my servers and compiling apps. I never ran a 7200 RPM drive, as I bought mine from the factory with SSD, but I did order it with the 4GB and later upgraded to 8GB which did make a remarkable difference in the performance of my virtuals.<p>SSD is definitely one of the biggest performance boost you can do, if one is looking to upgrade on the cheap and does not already have a SSD I would suggest making the move to SSD. The performance gain is very noticeable.<p>I would like to see what the same task done with 8GB and SSD in both machines would result in. While I am sure the new processor and memory architecture creates a noticeable improvement, it would be nice to see and Apples to Apples (pun intended) comparison.",1299941995

What is wrong with sockets?  Or plugs?  Or screws?  How would they make the IPad significantly thicker, heavier, more fragile, less powerful, or clunkier?  It would at worst make it 10% more expensive.  But that would waste so much less resources when it's time to upgrade, or when one piece is broken.  Oh wait, it wouldn't be as profitable, so let's pretend it just sucks and forget about it.<p>[a]:Â Good example, actually.  They could either have put the camera anyway, knowing the software could be patched later, or just wait until it's ready, or make it possible to add the camera later (maybe requiring an approved specialist to solder it on).  They just preferred the more lucrative path.  Like nearly everyone else in this planet.  I can hardly blame them personally for that, because:<p>> <i>Indeed they would be stupid not to capitalize on that.</i><p>From a selfish point of view, I agree: companies would be silly not to do everything in their power to maximize profit.  Even taking advantage of human weaknesses, or waste resources, or dumping trash in the wild, or <insert lots of horrible things here>.<p>I just say that something is wrong with such a system.",1299941692

Efficient use of all sustainable earth's solar input is a hard engineering problem (how best to stick satellites in space and then efficiently radiate back to base stations) but not impossible and would compete with anything Fusion (yes fusion) could produce. The world's current usage is estimated at 1.6 x 10^13/yr watts while 5.2 x 10^16 watts (30% of the sun's constant input to us) is completely reflected and never used by Earth.<p>And the end game in some far flung future would be solar taken straight from the sun.

My experience has been that they expected more out of you as an online student, that there was no ""credit"" given for ""face time"" (ie ""warming a seat"").  It's easy to fall out of touch with what employees are really doing right in the same room, especially with knowledge workers.   We often have no real idea what is going on at the computer screen in the next cubicle, to a degree I find rather shocking. I kind of feel like people have their head in the sand if they think simply being in the same room as a knowledge worker somehow gives them an idea of what they are up to.<p>Edit:  I don't have first hand experience working remotely myself.

The administrators who don't seem too curious to find out if the 21st century has yet invented a better, more convenient way for officers to log crimes. And of course, the politicians and higher-ups who think that crime numbers can and must perpetually slink toward zero.<p>Most alarming is the lack of our authorities to grasp cause and effect and basic statistics. The article notes that crime has fallen so low that even one felony causes a stir. I'm just a citizen but even I know that shit happens. Moreover, when crime reaches a low enough point, policing effectiveness may not be the main factor in crime occurrence...things like infrastructure (e.g. night lights) and social spending may be more of a determinant",1325339709

3410865,comment,3409628,3410721,0,0,jbermudes,,,"It's pretty much impossible to completely stop it. You can only choose how you will attempt to delay it or discourage it. Consider the war on drugs: at least there you have the advantage that you have a tangible object that you're seeking to limit access to which under our current understanding of physics is possible, but look how successful that has been. But trying to stop the spread of information that has no tangible limit and is trivial to spread?<p>As Corey Doctorow pointed out in his speech at a recent conference, copying will only get easier. In this world of increasingly computerized things, corporations will continue to struggle with this core problem: Computers (of all types) are general purpose (at the architecture level) and execute instructions given to it. How can we make it so it doesn't execute code that we don't like?<p>As others have pointed out, if your profitability relies chiefly on the secret order of 1s and 0s and restricting access to that voodoo then you're in for a long uphill battle because all of computing can be summed up as the art and science of copying bits from one location to another as cheaply and as efficiently as possible.<p>In the case of video game developers we've seen a few models that take into consideration copyright infringement. Some games have demonstrated profitable virtual economies with the company taking a cut of the profit, and even a company like Nintendo sells its hardware at a profit so as long as people have a reason to purchase Nintendo hardware there is room for a company like Nintendo to exist. This isn't to say these are the only or the best solutions, but rather just pointing out that to stay profitable going forward there is no reason to believe outdated business models will continue to thrive.",1325339621

3410861,comment,3409171,3409171,0,0,supar,,,"I often hear these arguments about C++, but after having used C++ for almost my
entire career (and looking forward to use C++11) let me tell you why people
continue to use C++: because C++ is performant, and the alternatives don't give
you enough control over the internals.<p>Yes, C++ is incredibly complex. Inherently <i>much</i> more complex than, say,
Haskell; due to the fact that C++ is far less consistent, has an hairy syntax,
and non-uniform libraries (a problem which is also shared by perl and ruby, due
to the language flexibility and rhetorical ""best practices"").<p><i>But</i> C++ delivers! And while not better than Python, it still allows
higher-level programming than C, while attaining the same level of performance.<p>While you probably don't care that python 3 (a language I also love) is overall
roughly 10% less efficient than the old 2.7, I need to figure out how to crunch
a dataset which is doubling each month, while CPU power is not increasing in
frequency any more. While your favourite language du-jour still needs to figure
out how to do basic multithreading, I'm actually exploiting it since <i>decades</i>,
including SSE and CUDA while I'm at it. Sure, the result is not pretty, but it
seems today that thrashing cycles ""in the cloud"" is not an issue anymore.<p>Thank god I don't work in that industry.",1325339435

My personal policy is ""forgiveness is a gift but trust is earned"".  Somehow, people are quick to ID me as a forgiving sort and then promptly conclude I'm a doormat and they can shit all over me to their heart's content.  Doormat?  Maybe.  Toilet? No thank you.

It's often a cruelty, not a kindness, to be too easy on people who are going around fucking up.  It frequently fails to foster real change and just helps people stay trapped.<p>Not saying one should always be a hardass.  But defaulting to candyass isn't any better.

Sometimes it was unstable.<p>Seen from ten thousand meters, Rakudo 2008-2010 was about features, and Rakudo 2011 has been about performance. As moritz' retrospective states, the fruits of that work are only coming online now. That will enable more people to move into performance-sensitive fields such as web development with Perl 6. That's already starting to happen; see tadzik's Bailador project, for example.<p>Meanwhile, my Perl 6 production code has been getting by with slightly lowered expectations on performance and memory frugality. Crashes/segfaults are no longer a problem (as they were in 2008/2009). Tradeoff example: My blog, which runs on Perl 6, is statically generated rather than dynamically. That's been working out pretty nicely.<p>When I need more speed and/or regex/grammar features, I go with Niecza. Otherwise, I mostly develop on Rakudo. But Niecza's main developer is developing at an almost intimidating pace, and I expect to be using Niecza even more in 2012.",1325336917

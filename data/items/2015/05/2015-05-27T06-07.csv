I found that there are thousands of great well documented frameworks that make developing web high performance web apps easy. Meteorjs for example took me about a weekend to learn, has a huge community  with lots of prebuilt packages, and countless tutorials that make implementing smooth animation incredibly easy. Before Meteorjs I used Angularjs and found mostly the same thing. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s similar with React or even just standalone Javascript Html and CSS3.",1432709995

The Extreme Programming answer is both &#x27;embrace change&#x27; and YAGNI. That means 1) we absolutely definitely require some general mechanism to be able to add columns to tables in the future, so we must have that in place, and not assume the product table schema is fixed forever 2) we have no idea what columns or how many columns will be needed in the future, so we don&#x27;t add any now speculatively.<p>But many people work in environments where adding a column to a table would be a massively expensive task (thousands of stored procedures that need rewriting etc.). In this context, the &#x27;YAGNI&#x27; response which just refuses to think about future does sound stupid, because it is.<p>[1] <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming</a>

How many of those factory workers could have been Stanley Kubricks or Federico Fellinis?

It seems to me that you&#x27;re essentially restating the Marxist Labor theory of Value, and I don&#x27;t subscribe to that, notwithstanding that I am the laborer in this case. Wealth is not created from labor alone; capital-at-risk (the part put up by big studios) is also a necessary factor of production. If you gather 100 talented or skillful people together you don&#x27;t necessarily end up with a product - they still need tools to work, raw materials to work on, and the product needs to be brought to market somehow. Digital technology assists with this but it is no way the panacea that some ideological folks imagine it to be. I can&#x27;t tell you how many otherwise-decent creative micro-budget projects fail  because the producers/directors haven&#x27;t made the right decisions about final manufacturing options (in terms of exactly what they have to produce that distributors are looking for) and marketing (in terms of budgeting for PR or film market exhibition costs to get it in front of distributors). I absolutely think the distribution companies and various intermediaries create significant economic value - it&#x27;s just not obvious to the general public outside the industry what it is that they do.

It pits the interests of the employer directly against the employee, since it&#x27;s in the employer&#x27;s interest to drag out the process for as long as possible, and reduces job mobility (which brings down wages for everyone) because the green card process needs to be restarted if employees switch jobs midway, before the I-485 step.<p>A system where any legally employed foreign worker can file for a green card for themselves seems much more sane.<p>Anecdotally, it seems to me that wages for H-1B visa holders are only lower when the employer files for a visa for an employee who is outside of the country. In my experience as a student who went the F-1 -> H-1B route, salaries are the same whether or not you have an H-1B. The much wider set of employers that you can interview with when you are already in the country probably makes it infeasible for employers to pay their H-1B employees who were already in the US under a different visa less than employees who don&#x27;t need a visa.",1432708458

Not many people realise that getting a visa to live and work in the USA is extremely difficult, if not possible.<p>I recently did some contracting work for a US based startup. I am based in Australia and the startup was in Seattle. I am in this weird area because I am self-taught and have no college/university degree and fall just under the 12 years required experience to substitute for a degree. The rule is 3 years of proven work experience for every year of a standard 4 year degree. So no visas applied to me I could apply for.<p>I eventually just took a remote contracting position with the company and flew over for the maximum 3 month stay and travelled around. During my time there I encountered a lot of taxi/Uber drivers who immigrated from various countries and nothing personally against them, but I have a unique skillset that this startup was looking for and was struggling to find themselves and yet it is impossible for me to travel and work in the USA? Once again no offence or ill-will, but how is it possible for someone to move to the USA to drive a cab, but a developer can&#x27;t actually get a job in the US? Kind of perplexing.<p>Supposedly the US values highly skilled jobs, but it seems they only class professions like a lawyer, doctor or some other profession that requires an extended period of study as highly skilled. For software development maybe considered highly skilled, but not so much front-end development/Javascript.<p>Comparatively, Canada make it easy to obtain a work/stay visa for an initial period of 2 years and I believe you can keep extending it.

Eg. sign into skype from your phone when your out and if your like in a movie then msg them back IMMEDIATELY and say be back to my OFFICE in 90 mins or what ever. 
- What is an external client phone meeting?<p>Basically as a contractor your main goal is to service the client to the max while taking your time and enjoying your work, taking advantage of the time the best you can.<p>Some people I know sit at there computer all day and service many clients at once giving them all the impression they are the only client. Your best bet is to show as much continuous service as possible while padding in other work like getting more clients, updating your skills etc.<p>Your not an employee congratulations - don&#x27;t be confused that you have to defend your time. The best contractors give the client everything they want and bill for all of it while taking advantage of being at home and padding in other work.",1432706412

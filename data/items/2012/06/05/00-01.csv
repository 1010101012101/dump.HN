4066791,comment,4064381,4066675,1,0,intellegacy,,,"Thanks for the reply. It's hard to remember sometimes that if wealth is defined by what humans value then increased choice can lead to more efficient wealth. I'm just having trouble reconciling the fact that wealth is being created when we achieve more efficiently what we want but the overall pie is not increasing. Perhaps the pie analogy has limitations. In your example, the pie wouldn't increase, but it would be a <i>better</i> pie. Does that makes sense?\nIt sounds strange as we are not used to thinking of wealth in terms of ""better"" or ""worse"", only more or less.<p><i>Now, you could say that there's money wasted on pizza marketing or too many entrants for all pizzerias to survive, so some will go out of business. All true, but those are short run phenomena. Over the long run, the result is greater efficiency. </i><p>Yes, this is what I'm thinking of. Too many competitors in the short-term. Is there a point where there are no more efficiencies to be found though? Or the efficiencies are so small as to be negligible? Like having 101 pizza shops vs. 100.<p>On an intuitive level, increasing the efficiency of production feels more important to me than maximizing efficiency of utility. But both affect wealth positively.",1338857681

4066770,comment,4064786,4066085,4,0,einhverfr,,,"I wouldn't call it just another SQL database.  The extensible type system is actually really cool and you can do a lot with it, and the same goes for Listen/Notify.  It's actually an application development platform in a box.<p>But I guess here's the flip side.  PostgreSQL is another <i>relational</i> database and and that means fundamentally it operates on sets of tuples.  For anything where set operations are helpful, the relational model brings something that no other models bring to the table.   I doubt I will ever see a viable ERP suite written on a NoSQL system.<p>OTOH, there are plenty of areas where set operations are not that big of a deal.  In this area, a networked, mostly reliable, multi-master replicated store of application state data is a really really cool thing.  For example, imagine MongoDB as a backplane for an LDAP forest, replacing local BDB storage for something like OpenLDAP.  The source data may be in a more mature data store somewhere and fed into MongoDB so if it gets lost it isn't the end of the world (just possibly some temporary business hicups).

It's hard to measure utility directly, but we can infer it by examining the opportunity cost - ie, the value of other alternatives foregone in favor of the option I prefer. Where a consumer's preferred product/service is unavailable or unaffordable, other goods are substituted, but these have lower utility. If rising consumer incomes cause people to switch from one good to another, the abandoned good is known as an 'inferior good'.To the extent that resources are dedicated to the production of something that people don't actually want, it's inefficient. It would be better if those resources were dedicated to the production of superior or ideal goods, of the kind that people buy because they already maximize utility.<p>This general field is called 'price theory.' Please appreciate that I can only sketch the crudest outline within a single paragraph.<p><i>If we add more competitors to the pizza arena, how does that grow the overall pie of wealth?</i><p>Greater choice leads to more efficient outcomes. You like cheap pizza served fast, so you get a slice for only $3 and don't waste money on linen tablecloths, which you consider a foolish affectation. I like nice service, so I pay $10 to spend a half-hour being seated and served by a waiter. You save money by not paying for services you don't want, I spend it locally instead of driving to the next town for a sit-down meal, which is what I actually want (as opposed to the drive, which costs me $3 in gas and mileage expenses). We both get what we want, pizzeria owners make money money, which they in turn spend on the goods and services they need, and you have a nice virtuous circle.<p>Now, you could say that there's money wasted on pizza marketing or too many entrants for all pizzerias to survive, so some will go out of business. All true, but those are <i>short run</i> phenomena. Over the <i>long run</i>, the result is greater efficiency. This pattern of short-term fluctuations between equilibria is the <i>business cycle</i>. What you're looking for is optimality, not necessarily growth. Again, all this is drastically oversimplified.",1338855240

We as engineers may like the hot new thing, but the company having paid for the hot old thing isn't just going to throw it out because you don't like it anymore.  :)<p>This is why we had the Y2K problem from a massive investment in COBOL.  We'll have other issues from a massive investment in Java over the next few decades as well.  It is what it is.  Learn Java.  Learn Play.  Learn Ruby, Python, PHP, C#, whatever you want to learn.  You'll be learning all your career.  The more languages you know, the better a developer you will be.  Embrace it now, forever will it dominate your destiny.",1338855216

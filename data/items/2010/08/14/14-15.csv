The market is flooded with designer come JS hack who learn a little jQuery and pitch themselves as a front end developer. I have done alot of development over 15 or so years and freelance doing Java, .NET, Database, SOA, iPhone, Android and JavaScript over the past 8 months I have not had a contract doing anything but JavaScript. I am so flooded with JavaScript work that I could not even get to one of the other projects even if I wanted to and JavaScript development seems to afford a 30% premium over any of the other work, iPhone coming a close second. Like the author said, it feels almost like the .com boom all over again.",1281797582

I learned programming in BASIC, moved on to game development in C/C++ and DirectX, programmed professionally in Java for 6 years, learned Scheme, learned Clojure, wrote a book on Clojure, am now learning Haskell...<p>But I was motivated to do all of that because of people I respected who said ""This contains some genuinely new ideas worth learning."" So far, I haven't heard anyone say that about APL, and so I guess I assumed that either its differentiation was only in a hyper-terse syntax, or that it was not generally suitable for a generalized programming language (similar to regex).<p>If that's an invalid assumption, then please point me towards an article elucidating what's great about APL, and I'll read it sincerely.",1281797520

To get it into every JVM, you would have to go through Oracle anyway, so nothing changes there. But if you wanted to distribute your own variation, a hypothetical openJVM+, Oracle is saying that they may well go after you with patent suits.<p>Good for people happy with the current JVM, looking for stability.

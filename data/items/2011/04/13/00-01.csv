It's one thing to take your peers as a whole and say you're better than them (and I'd agree that, by definition, if most people make that determination, they're wrong), but a very different thing to take a single peer and believe that you're better.  You may still be wrong, but it's easier to semi-objectively evaluate differences between your skills and a single other person's.<p>Of course everyone is biased to some extent, but the bottom line is that some people will correctly assess as skills difference.  If you have 10 people of varying ability (even only slightly varying), all making the same amount, 5 of them will be equal or better than the average of all of them.",1302656373

Just tell them they are no longer allowed to. It's illegal to call someone if they requested to stop calling. Most people simply don't know this and take the abuse.<p>I did this recently. The debt collector threatened to call me everyday. I responded by saying she wasn't allowed to ever call me again unless she had a better offer. Debt collectors are actually quite educated with the law, so I made it clear to her that I also understood it.<p>Here is the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act which is actually an interesting read, and may be useful to know statutes of limitations, etc. Although, I do know that tuition loans are exempt from some things such as bankruptcy as previously pointed out.<p><a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf</a><p>I wish I had better advice, but hopefully you can be armed with more information to at least prevent harassment.",1302656271

There'd be a relatively short delay every time you pressed the enter key as the new bit got compiled.<p>The problem with the approach taken is that it compiles everything you ever typed every time you type something. I honestly can't think of a worse combination. C++ is the language, you need a Python interpreter to run it. And there's no incremental compilation, so it just gets slower and slower the more you do.<p>People who write stuff in Python need to realise that sometimes you can't solve a problem just by wrapping something in Python. Occasionally you need to do some actual work. I'm afraid I see this all too often.",1302656249
2440175,comment,2438660,2439603,4,0,gamble,,,"I have degrees in CS and EE as well, and I was actually talking with one of our lab instructors on this topic yesterday.<p>It's obviously going to depend on the school, but my experience was also that EE does a better job of balancing theory and practice. There's a better sense of what constitutes foundational theory in EE than CS. Every EE program is going to have basic sciences, circuit theory, E&M, signals, control, etc. Beyond basic data structures and algorithmics, you can find almost anything in a CS curriculum.<p>On the practical side, CS professors typically have less experience in industry than in EE. The vast majority of professors in the engineering faculty at my university are professional engineers, which requires at least a couple of years of practical engineering work.<p>One point I will give CS, though - CS students typically get far more design experience than engineers. EE has a lot of emphasis on problem sets and lab exercises, whereas CS students are usually designing their own programs from the first day.",1302656227

Most Microsoft's devs are better than that!<p>Based on my experience, the fact that you did not get harder questions show that they thought you did not sail through the easy ones as they expected. And believe me, knowing the answer is one thing, explaining it clearly is another thing.<p>When I interviewed in Redmond last year, I got 5 interviews total. The first one is easy with all similar questions you got. The second was harder as the guy asked me a problem that starts off easy but when you add more data to it, it becomes more like an open problem. The third one is a OOP design question. The fourth one I met an engineer that joined MS from 1992 and he asked me only one algorithmic question that I have never seen before (Believe me, I read all those 'interviews' books and I know many ). It was very strange tree structure that I did not remember. I spent about 20 minutes stared at it and I got the first part after 35 minutes and then he asked me to explain how I finish the problem. He seemed to be OK with my answer. The last interviewer is a manager. He did not ask me anymore technical question but focus mostly on my preferences, experiences, previous jobs and some behavioral questions.<p>I think the interviews are on par with other top companies like Google ( but Google focus much more on scale ), Facebook and Amazon ( focus more on design and scale ).<p>In conclusion, rest assure that your interviewers are much smarter than you think.

2440148,comment,2440054,2440054,88,0,pmiller2,,,"I have worked in the student loan field.  First thing you need to do is contact your loan servicer immediately and work with them about your potential default situation.  (Even if you have already gone into default, you can get out of default by getting on a loan rehabilitation program and making 12 consecutive, on-time monthly payments under that plan, so all is not lost.)<p>Also, look into an income-based repayment plan.  These work basically the way you might think they do, in that your payment is based on a percentage of your income.  One nice thing about it is that if your income is low enough, your payment can end up being zero.  The kicker on the income-based payment plan is that if you make payments for 25 years, the loans go away, regardless of the amount you've payed on them.  If you're in for $100K+ and don't have a commensurate income, this can give you back some of your financial life (your debt-to-income ratio is going to be screwed up for the next 25 years, but at least you'll be able to make your loan payments on time).<p>Bottom line, contact your loan servicer IMMEDIATELY and ask about payment plans that are tied to your actual income.  It's your best option.  If you just let it go, you'll never see the end of it, as they can attach your bank account, take your tax refund from you, and probably worse.",1302655751

I was extremely financial ignorant at that age, not at all understanding the actual income of those who chooses career in the creative fields.<p>Straight out of school, I got an entry level marketing job offer. At that point, the job offer was so low, that it would leave me starving after my basic necessities, such as apartment & student debts are paid. I chose instead, to do something riskier, and more entrepreneurial straight out of school, thinking this is the only way I can make the amount of money needed to pay off my student debt + interest on the principle.<p>One year after, thank god I broke even.<p>For the past few years,  I have worked in various internet jobs, barely making enough to eat, let alone pay my student debt...<p>For the last year or so, I tried entrepreneurship again, this time with a bit more experiences & skills, ignoring my student debt completely. The extra money I would have paid for debt, I reinvested in the company.<p>Now, it's finally getting to that point, where I can ignore my student debt no longer, or else they will pursue legal actions <p>After living sub humanly for the past few years, after being harassed everyday to pay a debt that I really can not pay, if I want to eat, for an education that absolutely adds no values to my career, am a bit at the end of my rope.<p>So dear HN, what should I do to make the situation better, what could I do to make the situation better?",1302654103

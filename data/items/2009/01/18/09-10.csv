439238,comment,438556,438556,0,0,nailer,,,"Do you want to make money or not? You refer to your competitors as commercial - don't you intend to profit from your software yourself? If not, why bother putting so much effort into promotion?<p>Or do you mean proprietary instead of commercial? There are many commercial Open Source projects. It sounds like you want to become one.<p>In which case, are you selling support? Bespoke development?<p>I'd start by getting some testimonials from your existing users.",1232272375

439235,story,,,4,6,manorism,"HN Proposal",,"It seems most HN readers seem to prefer HN over the ""rest"" due to the ""discussion"" here. Therefore, I propose a simple change:<p>Instead of making the main heading link to the article, make it link to the discussion, regardless. Have a ""view article"" link where ""discuss"" is currently, to allow readers to view the article.<p>Although a simple change, I think it would change the overall view of HN drastically.<p>What are your thoughts?",1232272063

439230,comment,439084,439084,0,0,abecedarius,,,"The ""set stack"" and map ideas down at the bottom suggest a variant since I was just reading about A* search: a ""set priority queue"" that keeps the Ullman map's parallel members and values arrays in heap order according to the values. I'm thinking this might be good for A* when the search nodes can be denoted by dense-integer keys but the distances vary over a wider range.",1232271197

They have the same target audience, some of the same investors, and are working on the same problem - universal access to one's files.<p>I'd:<p>* Rebrand Zumodrive as a future version of Dropbox<p>* Use Dropbox's syncing model to ensure the local cache is kept up to date to a user-configurable percentage.<p>This would allow speedy access where the local device has the space, and still allow access where the local device doesn't have the space.",1232271130

439225,comment,438979,438979,0,0,abdulhaq,,,"I moved from emacs to eclipse, for python development, 3 years ago. Why? The nicely integrated subversion integration (subclipse), the SQLExplorer plugin, and PyDev. I only really use the editing features of pydev, I hardly ever go into debugging mode. I code everything these days using TDD and have eclipse set up to run nose (the test discovery script) on whatever is selected, be it a file or a directory. It also gives me code coverage.<p>I still love emacs but the future IMO is with eclipse.",1232270294

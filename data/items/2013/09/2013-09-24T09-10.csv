No, not the mosque around the corner from you right now [for most values of &#x27;you&#x27;], but such places exist, and its right for law enforcement to investigate them.<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand me. Killing civilians with secret orders via remotely piloted drones, with no trial, no public investigation and no accountability is broken. Obama has certainly given me hope.

Then 100s of devs copied it in some way or another. All these &#x27;games&#x27; look / work the same. I made one for a client and the 24 hours sounds plausible including artwork but excluding the actual levels. That would take around another day. Making a few $100 / month constant for a few days work is ok in my book, although it&#x27;s not the work I would want to do; like you say, it&#x27;s uncreative and actually boring.<p>However; for these kind of games there is no &#x27;support&#x27;; people like it or don&#x27;t like it, but you don&#x27;t get support requests; people who experience issues with the software just uninstall it. It&#x27;s not worth actually fixing it for a few outliers with crap white label phones. So you don&#x27;t actually have any work with these things and that beats Taco Bell.<p>I think the reason he is not killing it is the nature of these games; they <i>are</i> very easy to make so there are 1000s of clones in the Play Store, people usually cheat (look up the answers) and those who like them have more than 10 installed on their phone. So the ad exposure is very short lived. Installs are not a very good metric; play time is; you&#x27;re not going to keep apps like this active for a long time.<p>If you make an app which gives value to people or games with fresh content every week , you will make a lot more money.

And that&#x27;s before taxes.  What will you owe the IRS if you&#x27;re in the US?  What are you paying in hosting?  Is this really the &quot;mobile revolution&quot; glorified day after day in the news?  So $500/month after Google pulled the rug from under you?  Only &quot;24 hours&quot; but what about tech support, compatibility issues, the market research, artwork, learning to package the apps, complying with Google&#x27;s rules, setting up your development environment?  How many days does &quot;24 hours&quot; add up to, start to finish?  But forget the money, at the end of the day this sounds like unrewarding work: ripping off other people&#x27;s ideas. Which makes me wonder, you&#x27;re obviously clever enough to get a million downloads, why such an uncreative approach?  I&#x27;m just trying to understand the app market everyone is raving about.  How many times have we all heard &quot;the future is mobile, the future is mobile.&quot;  Is making these apps (games?) really that enjoyable?  I&#x27;m curious because I&#x27;m thinking of making an Android app.  When I read stories like this, makes me think twice.  What you&#x27;re doing sounds really smart from a marketing perspective because 1. you&#x27;re making games which are by far the most popular apps and 2. you&#x27;re replicating the most popular games.  So you <i>should</i> be killing it, making 100x more than all the other app developers who didn&#x27;t sell out, the developers building interesting, original, useful apps.  Yet, you&#x27;re not.

6436810,comment,6432823,6432823,1,0,michaelkariv,,,"My biggest problem with 10x is that it commonly misunderstood. The mythical man month (MMM) book explained, an average developer is 3x the worst. the best is 3x an average. So the dynamic range is 9x, but it isn&#x27;t a math so who cares. And if you are an normal developer with a friend who 3x faster, it is a career guy in a company you would not touch with a long stick, that makes you average and your friend 10xer. 
This misunderstanding makes people say 10xers are rare. They are not. People who are 10x better than you are rare.<p>I am not that person. I am an average guy. I meet devs 3x my inferior, and 3x my superior. So I do think 10x range that MMM talks about is possible.<p>My second problem with the article is unit of measurement question.
It is very clear what it is. A time to completion of a well defined task by an individual developer, with predetermined level of quality of the result.
The problem is in the measurement. To measure you have to waste resources giving same task to many. And quality measurements are imprecise. 
MMM book was all about the time to completion. Obviously nobody counts lines of code. Why even bringing it up?<p>While I think 9x range is possible, I have never seen it in real life medium size teams. (I am a short term projects freelancer, so I see two companies a year over last 18 years) The reason being, my theory goes, a contextual one. Start-ups ship buggy code fast. A fab automation company might test a released code for a year before shipping. I believe it isn&#x27;t the issue of A players hiring A players and B players hiring C players. It&#x27;s just the goals differ. I was faster than most at a certain client of mine, but my code was less reliable. That was fine for a specific task I was hired for, but not for most what they do.<p>My third problem is that the article tries to fight the notion of importance of hiring 10xers. In many cases individual performance meters less. Imperfectly studied as it might be, 10x performance measurability beats other metrics of what makes a good developer, and a good employee. How do you measure ability to communicate, motivational power, leadership, and plain good taste? So for established companies 10x hiring is not as critical.
And yet, I can clearly see why start-ups are focused on 10xers (ninjas etc). In start-ups individual devs have more autonomy, by design.  Winner-takes-most aspect requires short time to market. Delivery times matter much more then quality. That being the case, hiring an obnoxious jerk who codes like hell makes clear if perhaps a temporary benefit.<p>So if you agree that for a startup time to market is a key, and individual developer relative importance is high, a logical conclusion is makes sense to search for (and overpay) the best. Just like it makes sense to fire 10xers once startup gets traction and replace with normally paid, normally performing guys that function great as a team.",1380013958

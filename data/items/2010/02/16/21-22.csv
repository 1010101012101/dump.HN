[1]  I kinda agree with you on culture is important, but I find that generalizations there fall flat, as subcultures within a culture tend to contradict each other. In all cases, the fundamental fallacy of bias comes from using attributes associated with some group to make decisions about an individual, who may or may not share those attributes.  Our brains attempt to create heuristics for us, we have to actively work to supplant them with logic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1129487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1129487</a>",1266357524

In the enterprise sector we need to assure that our applications can be used as intended by a teenager as well as a 65 year old CEO. There are ways to make user interfaces intuitive. One is to copy things from the material world: folders, archives, tabs, etc. The other is to follow abstract paradigms that have been popularized by a few big applications: microblogging, my profile, my wall, etc. In my opinion, the use of paradigms that were created just a few years back, such as most of the interactions in social networks, cannot be assumed to be understood by everyone (stupid or smart) and should be made as intuitive as possible.",1266357437

1129979,comment,1129473,1129762,0,0,akeefer,,,"The JVM is a great platform if the language in question is relatively close to Java, and you're just layering on higher-level syntax like closures.  (Sure, it would be nice if Java supported them, but they're not hard to implement as anonymous inner classes, and to simulate real closing over variables you just need to wrap all captured variables in one-element arrays or other wrapper objects at the declaration side.  It's annoying, but it's livable).<p>The further you move away from the Java typesystem or execution model, the less fun your life will be and the fewer benefits you'll get from the JVM:  moving to dynamic typing will cost you a large amount of performance, for example, and you'll have to fight the Java type system a fair amount.  I can only imagine what it would mean to do lazy-evaluation in a JVM language.<p>If it matches what you're trying to do, though, it's really a great platform:  the bytecode format is pretty simple and easy to learn, the JVM runs of pretty much any platform you need, and it does a huge amount of optimization for you.  If you're doing a statically-typed language and compiling down to Java-like bytecode (as opposed to handling dispatch yourself, as you have to do in a dynamically-typed language), you also basically get debuggers and profilers for free.<p>It's definitely a little weird, though, that they'd set up the motivation for HLVM as due to the weaknesses of the CLR's cross-platform capabilities, without mentioning the JVM at all, given that the JVM was, in spirit at least, the precursor to the CLR and still the most widely-used higher-level VM and one that works basically everywhere.",1266356488

I think that simpler forms of humor indicate, not lower intelligence in those enjoying them, but tensions and stresses that are nearer to the surface of their lives. (Did I mention that ""All Your Base"" still cracks me up?)<p>By my theory, Monty Python's ""wide accountant sea"" is the product of a civilization that is largely content with its lot in the world; but if a civilization finds it adequately entertaining to observe that I are serious cat and this are serious thread, then there are problems somewhere near the surface of that civilization, and the civilization is aware of them.<p>As an example: at least as far as I know, East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) humor is much simpler than American and English; East Asians are more intelligent than Americans and Englishmen on average (at least as measured by IQ testing), but they have social stresses that are _much_ nearer to the surface.<p>I also doubt that low intelligence limits comprehension of refined humor. G.K. Chesterton thought that the English peasantry, who were at the least uneducated, were better at telling and at understanding jokes than their social betters; my own -- admittedly just anecdotal -- experience also seems to suggest no correlation between intelligence and sophistication of humor, but a high correlation between low social class and low education on the one hand, and good comedic style on the other.",1266354410

6716614,comment,6716242,6716242,7,0,nemesisj,,,"A few things here that I think most are missing:<p>1. Mailchimp is targeted (and priced for) the small business.  Most small businesses aren&#x27;t going to have lists more than a few thousand, which means most of Mailchimp&#x27;s customers are going to be paying less than 50ish bucks a month.<p>2. If you&#x27;ve got thousands and thousands of emails to send, and are paying multiple thousands of dollars to mailchimp each month, you&#x27;re probably just going to use mandrill and hire a dev to help you out there.<p>3. For those customers that are spending larger amounrd (500-1000 bucks a month?), they&#x27;re going to marketing managers at midsize businesses who would never get IT love and can easily justify the purchase against conversions to sales.<p>4. Lastly, most people who use mailchimp send more than 1 email a month, therefore, most of the commentary surrounding the pricing divided by one send a month isn&#x27;t really accurate.",1384246732

6716609,comment,6716112,6716375,6,0,rcthompson,,,"Yeah, I saw an article somewhere that pointed out what I believe is the problem with the endgame. In the last sector, the feel of the game changes completely. You&#x27;ve just spent seven sectors fleeing before the might of the unstoppable rebel fleet, and you finally get to the Federation base, and they say &quot;OK, now find the biggest, baddest rebel ship and kill it.&quot; This jarring shift, combined with the flagship breaking all the rules (e.g. having drones after you&#x27;ve killed their drone systems) and yet still being trivial to defeat using specific gimmicks, really breaks the endgame for experienced players. Like the author of the aforementioned article that I can&#x27;t seem to find, I only play the first seven sectors now. The final sector is so unenjoyable that I just quit when I get to the final sector and start a new game so I can go back to having fun.",1384246582

6716580,comment,6716399,6716399,46,0,weland,,,"This article is remarkably <i>low on arguments</i>, despite being so long. Just a few of its gems:<p>> OOP is wrong because of its definition of an object, and its attempt of trying to fit everything into it. When that goes to the extreme, you arrive at the notion everything is an object. But this notion is wrong, because:
> There exists things that are not objects. Functions are not objects.<p>This has two problems:<p>1. It&#x27;s factually wrong. Smalltalk functions are first-class objects.<p>2. It fails to explain <i>why</i> that would be wrong (assuming it were, you know, true).<p>The author does give the (poor) examples of Python and Scala, which -- in his opinion -- incorrectly call a function an object, because only the __call__ and apply are the &quot;function objects&quot; one is trying to define, but they were &quot;kidnapped&quot; and jailed into their wrapping objects. IMO, this is ontologically incorrect. The same can be said of any object&#x27;s definition: if I have an object called PlaneVector, the &quot;vector object&quot; itself would actually be only its x and y properties, which I have kidnapped and jailed into my object.<p>The fact that this structure (the object I&#x27;m defining in my programming language) is <i>not the same</i> as its counterpart in the world of ideas (i.e. the plane vector in maths) should be fairly obvious, despite using the same generic term (i.e. object) to denote both.<p>Behold, then, the straw man:<p>> Most OO languages also lack correct implementations of first-class functions. An extreme is Java, which doesnt allow functions to be passed as data at all. You can always wrap functions into objects and call them methods, but as I said, thats kidnapping. The lack of first-class functions is the major reason why there are so many design patterns in Java. Once you have first-class functions, you will need almost none of the design patterns.<p>There are a lot of things wrong with Java, of course, which does not mean that they are also issue of object-oriented programming. Inheritance (sorry...) doesn&#x27;t work both ways: the fact that a Lexus is prohibitively expensive doesn&#x27;t mean moving vehicles are prohibitively expensive.<p>I have less of a problem with the author&#x27;s treatment of functional programming. What he&#x27;s essentially trying to argue is that:<p>> Simulating them [side effects] with pure functions is doomed to be inefficient, complicated and even ugly. Have you noticed how easy it is to implement circular data structures or random number generators in C? The same is not true for Haskell.<p>IMO, this is true, but the isolation of side effects doesn&#x27;t have to happen only by the ugly means he outlines next (i.e. monads) in <i>every</i> application. A typical CRUD application the web kids like to write can be written so that the only side effects involved are in fact modifications of the database, in which case the side effects are confined to SQL.<p>I also think there&#x27;s an ontological error in this argument. Its foundation is that FP tries to &quot;ignore&quot; side effects even though they are real, but the examples the author gives are several layers of abstraction below. C also woefully ignores <i>some</i> of the side effects in the silicon (e.g. if you go low enough, calling a function with no side effects that does not even alter the state of the program will, in fact, alter the state of the underlying silicon, and quite substantially so), and I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that we can&#x27;t quite move the debate into <i>which</i> of those should be ignored or not.<p><i>All</i> languages abstract the silicon away, and it&#x27;s not only good that they do, it&#x27;s what they were built for. I honestly don&#x27;t miss hardwiring relays.",1384246145

6716564,comment,6716112,6716124,12,0,simias,,,"To offer a counterpoint I on the other hand was pretty disappointed with the game.<p>I found there was not enough variety with the encounters (you keep seeing the same &quot;abandoned space station&quot;/&quot;rogue drone&quot; events very regularly). It&#x27;s hard to forgive because all events are text-based, so it&#x27;s not really difficult to add variety. That being said, maybe this extension solves this issue by adding a lot more events.<p>Others point out the extreme randomness of the game but I think it&#x27;s only an issue because the game forces you to push forward (backtracking is almost never possible or very costly) which reduces your margin of error and makes you very dependent on the clemency of the &quot;Random Number God&quot;. It&#x27;s of course a very explicit design choice and the game wouldn&#x27;t be the same without it but it does make for some very frustrating moments.<p>But I think the main problem I&#x27;ve had with the game is that it&#x27;s sold as a roguelike (or rather, a roguelike-like) and in my opinion in doesn&#x27;t come close to DCSS, nethack, angband and others in terms of depth of gameplay and &quot;replayability&quot;. For me a roguelike is a game where you can end up in a seemingly desperate situation and still succeed by thinking out of the box and use an unexpected strategy. I&#x27;ve never had one of those moments in FTL. You can&#x27;t take over other people&#x27;s ships for instance, which would open a lot of new strategies. Of course the definition of &quot;roguelike&quot; is a bit loose so maybe I&#x27;m just too narrow minded.<p>All that being said for it&#x27;s price it&#x27;s definitely worth trying and see for yourself, I know some people have sunk hundreds of hours in this game so I guess they found something in it that eluded me...",1384245936

Lots of levered investment but lots and lots of fraud as there was almost no regulation. Like this example, you would have brokerages just take customer funds and then just disappear. The move towards foreign exchange trading was, also like bitcoin, driven by the lack of regulation, speculative possibilities, etc.  Since then it&#x27;s become regulated heavily globally and the game-theoretic defection has not held.

They were connected by a twentysomething named Arthur Rock who&#x27;d recently ditched corporate finance in NY. Rock also later invested in Intel.<p>Much of VC actually grew out of Fairchild. Eugene Kleiner of KPCB was one of the Fairchild founders, and Don Valentine was a Fairchild sales+marketing exec before starting Sequoia. Those two firms essentially invented modern day VC investing, and you could say Fairchild was the first experiment that worked.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting how much VC has grown since then. Intel only raised 2.5MM before going public. Technology is now <i>much</i> more broad, and there&#x27;s more money to fund diverse companies. Back then, tech was a niche industry.<p>Hard science is certainly still getting funded out here -- see Counsyl, LightSail Energy, etc. -- but I think lots of investors are now looking at existing industries that can be flipped via software (cue pmarca&#x27;s &quot;software is eating the world&quot; neo-adage).

And no, you can not do this in Python, it&#x27;s too slow.<p>- Information Retrieval at a large scale.<p>- Any large systems. Java has debugging capabilities like no other language I know. Please don&#x27;t use J2EE!<p>If you want to work for Google, you need to know C++. C++ is 20 - 30% faster then Java and it matters at Google scale. But no one else has the Google scale in the corporate world.<p>JavaScript is another &quot;must to know&quot; these days, especially Node.js and AngularJS.<p>Python is the nicest interpreted languages I know. Really good for learning data analysis, machine learning and natural language processing. Tons of good libraries.",1384244984

6716496,comment,6716112,6716417,4,0,LinaLauneBaer,,,"Your comment does not do the game justice IMHO. FTL is a solid game and I spent a lot of hours with it. It is true that there are a lot of random events in the game but you can plan a little or let&#x27;s say: You can improve the odds:<p>For example there is a subsystem (forgot it&#x27;s name) that let&#x27;s your ship jump to every previously visited location. So if you find a map of the current sector later on and this map reveals a store you may be able to simply jump back to it if the fleet is not yet there. Also: If the fleet is already there you can still jump back. You only have to fight a ship from the fleet. Then you go to the store, buy your goods and jump back.<p>Also: You can plan your route through a sector. You should try to visit as many places as you can but still be ahead of the fleet. This is a very cool challenge - especially for CS people route planning, route optimization, etc<p>Your actions also have a direct influence on what you get: For example if you encounter a hostile ship you can destroy it or make a plea bargain with them. Usually the ship will offer you fuel, scrap (=money) or other stuff you may or may not need. If you decide to destroy the ship instead you usually get less goods (fuel, weapons) and more scrap (money). So if you plan (haha) to visit a store soon you may decide to destroy the ships on your way.<p>There is a whole wiki-community for this game. They note different strategies:<p><a href=""http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/FTL:_Faster_Than_Light_Wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/FTL:_Faster_Than_Light_Wiki</a><p>Also you can upgrade your ship with scrap (money). You have to decide what system to upgrade.<p>When fighting another ship it makes a huge difference if you know what you are doing or not. Of you are a noob you will most likely be destroyed or loose too much during the fight.<p>Before you start your journey you can also pick one of several different ships. Every ship has different characteristics. Even your crew members have different capabilities:<p>There is one species where each crew member gives the room where the crew member is in additional power.
Guys from other species are made of rock: Use them to distinguish fires on your ship.<p>Fire on your ship is a huge topic.<p>Fire occurs when your ship is hit by sun flares, big weapons or other dangerous stuff. Fire is causing damage to your ship and makes the current room unusable. You can plan ahead to deal with fire:<p>You can control the hatches of your ship. Some people have all hatches open so that all unused parts of the ship are exposed to space. This means that those rooms have no oxygen in them. When a fire happens in those rooms it automatically disappears after a few seconds because in those rooms there is no oxygen.<p>You can plan so much in this game",1384244901

Maybe you should read a forum or something?<p>You can give yourself an easy bonus just by training against the first enemy you encounter that can&#x27;t penetrate your shields. Make sure you have helm, engines, shields, and weapons manned and you aren&#x27;t auto-firing enough to damage the enemy then just let the game sit for an hour or two while your crew levels up.<p>Early on your shields are plenty vs. the non-missiles of the enemies you encounter so all that matters is upping your engines enough to dodge missiles and saving enough spare money for stores. A nice bonus is that you can run away faster too.<p>Once you hit a store with enough money and a teleporter, bio beam, cloaking device, or drone system and defense drone, you win basically. Teleporter/bio beam lets you capture enemy ships intact for massive resource gains (and disable weapons on the end boss) and it is easy to micromanage your  guys and beam them back and forth to take any ship. Cloaking lets you dodge full enemy salvos. Defense drone takes care of the pesky missile problem, the only really effective weapon in the game as long as you keep your shields upgraded properly.<p>I can win reliably on easy with any ship, and often on normal. If you can&#x27;t win on easy you are just missing some technique. You can&#x27;t scout but you can easily pick the right nodes to see the maximum number of nearby nodes, picking the optimal path, etc.. If there&#x27;s anything I hate about the game it&#x27;s the fact that there are so many auto-win scenarios. If I run into a teleporter in a store in a ship that doesn&#x27;t start with one and I can afford it selling anything non-critical, I pretty much win, so it isn&#x27;t fun.",1384244737

There&#x27;s nothing nefarious about them.<p>Reg NMS prohibits exchanges from displaying quotes that would lock (bid==ask) or cross (bid>ask) another marketplace.<p>As an example, say BATS is 10.01 bid 10.02 offered and the 10.02 offer trades out completely. Some HFTs want to be the first to form the new 10.02 bid to earn the spread + liquidity rebate, so they send post-only bids at 10.02. BATS sees stale 10.02 offers on ARCA, so they re-price the trader&#x27;s order to 10.01 bid, or reject it (behavior depends on the exchange). In response to this, HFT algos would repeatedly re-submit their orders until the exchange let them in. This led to enormous stress on their matching engines during price moves.<p>In response, exchanges created order types that would let the trader bid 10.02, but only display it once the away markets faded from their point of view. It&#x27;s basically like having a callback API rather than a polling one. The end result is basically the same, except less load is placed on the exchange&#x27;s matching engine.<p>There&#x27;s nothing &quot;rigged&quot; about this behavior. Traders forming new price levels on public markets still incur substantial risk that the price will move against them when filled. There aren&#x27;t any order types that let you get execution priority in front of a large queue like he describes.<p>These order types and their behavior were well-documented on public websites and anyone concerned with the microstructure of how their trades executed could easily use them. The game he&#x27;s describing is of little concern to anyone other than HFT MMs and execution algos that depend on favorable queue position. The entire process of a level ticking away and a new price being formed in liquid tick-wide names plays out in microseconds these days.",1384244552

As a Coloradan, it was almost comical to see so much specialty beer from home so far away.<p>Soon after returning from my most recent trip, I happened to sit next to an employee of Left Hand Brewing (Probably the most weirdly ubiquitous Colorado beer I saw there that trip) during lunch, and it turns out some beverage exporter pays the freight on the kegs to and from Tokyo just to bring Left Hand overseas.

There is nothing about the stateful nature of C-programming, its syntax or the patterns people use that is easy to reason about. You&#x27;re comparing it to what, exactly? C++? C is an amazing language but comparing it to the languages that were around when it became popular it&#x27;s not even close to relatively easy to reason about. Even less so nowadays.<p>> provides enough abstraction to easily write complicated code<p>This strikes me as a weird thing to list in &quot;pros&quot;. Complicated is the opposite of good. Abstractions should let you write simple code, not complicated code. I feel like you&#x27;ve either misunderstood the word &quot;complicated&quot;, massively mischaracterized C or you have a very weird view on abstraction.<p>> Of course, some other language with this set of properties might have taken C&#x27;s role if it had not been for unix, so maybe that&#x27;s what you meant.<p>I&#x27;d like to point out that your assumption that people use programming languages because they are better than the alternatives is pretty naive. The most popular languages are decent, no doubt, but have you noticed how every really good language suffers from a pretty huge lack of users? We all know these languages are <i>better</i>, but it&#x27;s never been an issue of &quot;You&#x27;re not good enough for people to use you&quot;.<p>If there was ever any indicator for a good language it&#x27;d be &quot;What do people choose when they have the freedom, knowledge and opportunity to choose anything without any outside influence?&quot;. That scenario is so wildly scarce to observe and anyone who is in that situation likely suffers from biases acquired earlier on his programming journey.",1384243221
6716417,comment,6716112,6716112,1,0,anonymous,,,"Too bad the unfair, uncontrollable, unmitigateable randomness turns this otherwise excellent game in a poor joke. There is no planning you can do, since every shop is random and there is nothing you can do if the game just decides to spawn precisely the kind of enemy that can kill you right then and there. All the different combat systems and options are good, but given that you have no idea what weapon drops you&#x27;ll get, you can&#x27;t do any planning ahead. Additionally, if you start having to run away from battles you fall behind the curve and there&#x27;s no going back. You can&#x27;t just scout the sector to find easy enemies to beat, because you have a very tight limit on how much exploring you can do. Once you fall behind the resource curve and have to run away from more and more encounters you&#x27;re already dead.<p>I spent 15 hours with this game, did close to 40 attempts and only once got to sector 7. Usually I&#x27;d die around sector 4 or 5.<p>If you already have the game and like it, good for you. I just want to warn other people.

I've met many ""type 2s"" who can give you a great database and object model for whatever you feed them, but would be utterly lost if ever asked to translate into code.<p>And God help them if you describe a bug to them and ask them where they'd begin looking.<p>In the end it boils down to not <i>doing</i>. To be good at anything you need practice and experience, not just rote knowledge.

This is what happens with fiat money.<p>On the other hand if we use gold, then if I create value - a house - you can't also create more gold to match it, so instead I just deflated the value of the gold (i.e. the ratio of value of real propery vs the value of all the gold just changed) - that's bad.<p>Gold money does not, and can not work unless you are in a static economy. Fiat money works in both cases.<p>Please spread the news: the anti fiat money/anti  federal reserve/anti fractional reserve banking meme's are dead.",1226800033

365679,comment,365488,365488,0,0,kurtosis,,,"""There is no permanent place for ugly mathematics""<p>-G.H.Hardy<p>I loathe these automatic proof systems (at least the state of the art today) - I think they may be useful for verifying that a complex CPU correctly implements integer arithmetic - but these proofs have little to offer a human mathematician.  Let's follow Paul Erdos who said ""one need not believe in god, but a mathematician should believe in The Book""  The Book is where god (the supreme fascist) has collected the shortest and most elegant proofs in mathematics.  Here's a great book written in this spirit (dedicated to Erdos) -<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=KvQr9l0wgf8C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=KvQr9l0wgf8C</a><p>when a theorem prover can produce a proof as elegant as as the one given in this book of say sperner's lemma then I'll give them another look.

365673,comment,365488,365610,0,0,jerf,,,"In our actual, factual physical universe, the Continuum Hypothesis isn't so much ""true"" or ""false"" as ""irrelevant"". It's possible the universe is fundamentally discrete, in which case it just doesn't apply to anything physical, and even if it turns out to be continuous in some sense, it's likely to be some hybrid continuous/discrete combo where the hypothesis still doesn't apply to anything physical.<p>(One of the points made in Reflections on Relativity ( <a href=""http://www.mathpages.com/rr/rrtoc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathpages.com/rr/rrtoc.htm</a> ) is that both a continuous universe and a discrete universe, taking the traditional senses of the term, are logically contradictory things to build a universe out of, and Einsteinian relativity calls for an odd mixture of both. No clean link to a single page as, IIRC, the point is made over a series of sections, culminating in a unique (AFAIK) discussion of Zeno's Paradoxes, which I <i>can</i> link to: <a href=""http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s3-07/3-07.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s3-07/3-07.htm</a> although you really need to read the sections before that for full impact.)<p>So, sleep easy. It is nothing more and nothing less than a choice of axiom. The axiom of choice is similarly irrelevant in the real universe; since use of the axiom calls for the selection of an infinite set from another infinite set, possibly uncountable, it has no particular connection to the real, finite universe.",1226798189

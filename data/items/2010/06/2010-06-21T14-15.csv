Here's how long it took to launch each one.  Spot the big bang test: ten minutes, fifteen minutes, fifteen minutes, 30 seconds, 15 seconds, an hour, three hours, three weeks.<p>Small A/B tests also have small risks associated with them.  One of those eight touches a single word on my website.  It is almost inconceivable that that one-word change could result in a POed customer sending me email.  On the other hand, the big bang test can cause (and has caused) customer support issues for me, despite taking a great deal of time to minimize the impact.<p>In addition, big bang tests are often less conclusive than you want them to be.  My current Big Bang test is significant at 95% right now, against the pivot I want to make.  I am of two minds: on the one hand, I want to bow to that inevitability.  On the other hand, I'm seriously wondering whether it is the pivot causing the disparity or if it is just implementation details of the pivot.  In a standard A/B test, the change <i>is</i> the implementation detail.  However, given that I had to adjust something like 30 files, I'm wondering if customers are really rejecting the pivot or whether they just think the graphic I made for it is exceptionally hideous.  (I started an A/B test for just the graphic and it is, indeed, getting whupped versus what it replaced.)<p>Since the big bang A/B test frequently changes mountains and drops you at the unoptimized bottom of the new mountain, you're left either trying to do hillclimbing on two hills in parallel (which is OK, as long as you don't mind your engineering team cutting out your intestines and using them to strangle you) or doing the deeply unsatisfying ""Well, I really feel better about B, so we're going to hop over there and then start hillclimbing, then pat ourselves on the back and assure ourselves it was the right decision all along.""",1277132394

1448977,comment,1448507,1448507,0,0,demallien,,,"The promess of Voice Recognition has never been the actual transcripting of the spoken word - although even that would be quite useful if a high degree of accuracy is achieved - but rather in the idea of controlling a computer by simply talking to it using natural language.  People want the computer to behave as if it is a colleague, not a machine.<p>Of course we're a <i>long</i> way from that goal.  Firstly, people don't understand just how difficult it is to express clearly what it is that you want.  I have a good friend that had bought an iPhone whilst she was living abroad for 6 months.  On returning back home, she wanted to be able to add new songs to her iPhone without losing the stuff already on there.  That's how she described the task to me, as the go-to person for computer problems.  So I started asking a bunch of questions - do you still have the same computer that you were using abroad?  Do you want copy the music already on the iPhone onto your computer?  What about other data on the iPhone, do you need to recover that too, or can I blow it away?  She got very frustrated with all of these questions and finally just snapped ""Oh, you know what I mean, I just want to be able to use my iPhone normally, including adding new stuff to it!""<p>Sigh.  She really didn't (doesn't) understand that this just isn't enough information for me to work with - and that's me, as a walking talking human being with a strong understanding of what the computer is doing.  How is a computer, with problems in transcribing the spoken words, let alone understanding the underlying meaning of those words, and not having any idea of the real world context of the problem, supposed to figure out what she wanted?",1277132275

But included with it you have a library that allows you to create a webserver.<p>Instead of having a webserver and couple a serverside language to it, you have a serverside language that is able to spawn its own webserver (although you can choose to use Apache or others).<p>The biggest advantage though, comes from the fact that JS is a functional language with a focus on event based programming. And so Node.js follows that paradigm: you use JS functions that are binded to certain events and run when one event happens, instead of running continously and doing some kind of loop waiting on I/O,CPU, database, etc. This allows for better performance.<p>Plus there's the advantage of being able to program websites using the same language both client-side and serverside.

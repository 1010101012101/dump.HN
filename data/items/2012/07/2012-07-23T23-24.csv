Should weekly tips only be given to people whose work I use weekly? If so, then yes, I agree that $0.25/week is not a good tip.<p>But what about the person whose Emacs config files I read at GitHub and found somewhat informative? And what about the person whose personal wiki (e.g., Org Mode files) I read at GitHub and found somewhat informative? Should I give these people good one-time tips instead of small weekly tips? Maybe I should, but I think I'd like to have the option to give them small weekly tips. Or is there some reason I shouldn't have this option?",1343087984

There are a <i>lot</i> of sites on that network, all of which provide an excellent resource.<p>However, here's the key element that would keep 'marketers, advertisers, and product peeps' out: competition.<p>GitHub works because people are <i>sharing</i> their code. If you worked on a marketing campaign, are you going to release your market research with what works best to your competitors? If you create a product, are you going to ignore patents and release that design/schematic for free?<p>In a perfect world, the answer would be yes, but a lot of people simply aren't open to the same level of sharing that a lot of developers are. Why did open source software take off, but not nearly as much ""open source products?"" I'm not sure, but I think it has something to do with the culture of shared knowledge, and the satisfaction of someone else using your work.<p>You can still make a profit on open source software -- $RHT is an example of that -- but would you be able to do the same if your product <i>itself</i> was open source?

4283573,comment,4281630,4282958,3,0,ninjin,,,"> Is there any mathematics on defining what % of the dataset should be training vs. testing or is it left to the analyst (like with confidence intervals (95% hypothesis testing etc.))?<p>In my own field, Natural Language Processing (NLP), it is either up to the original creators of a dataset or you do your own split if there isn't one established already. I'll go with what I have learned for supervised learning.<p>In an ideal world all three sets; training, development (the Machine Learning people sometimes call this one verification if I remember correctly) and test should be infinitely large. Also, you should preferably not stratify or try to make the assignment anything but random (there are cases where this could be justified, but let's not go there just yet).<p>I personally go for a 3/6 train, 1/6 development and 2/6 test, but I have just as well seen 2/4, 1/4 and 1/4, etc. Training is essential, so it gets the biggest cut, testing is important too so it also gets a large chunk and development is the least important out of the three so it gets the smaller one. In short, train is for making sure your algorithm can learn something, development is in order to guide your development and not fool yourself, lastly, test is in order to be able to make claims that you state to other people (thus, it is pretty darn important).<p>I then use the train and development set when constructing the model, I do the write-up of most of my results and then generate the final results by running on the test set only once with the model that performed the best on development. What you usually see is a drop in performance, but this is expected since you have most likely overfitted the development set. Since the hyper parameters need to be adjusted as well I commonly do ten-fold cross-validation on the test set and use some variant of grid-search (read yesterday that this approach for hyper parameters is coming under fire as being naive, I need to have a look at what has been going on in ML for the last two years).",1343086716

Everyone has their own private Steve Jobs, Sutton says. It usually tells you a lot about themand little about Jobs.<p>This isn't about Jobs being good or bad for the world. It's about his managerial legacy. Essentially, nearly every account of Jobs' life devolves into a hagiography, espousing subjectively his deeds, trying to fit them into a theology of sorts, which distorts generations of entrepreneurs' views of Jobs. Many misread him being great <i>because</i> he was an asshole, but overlook the fact that if he was <i>right</i>, it's because he was <i>right</i> that the product succeeded.

4283489,comment,4283307,4283307,46,0,3pt14159,,,"I've been saying this for years. It is easier, <i>way easier</i>, to sell someone a 12 dollar a month subscription to a traditional SaaS app that stores their sales leads. Get your monthly churn rate down to 2% over time and you have a client with a life time value of $600.[1]<p>Now, you could spend the same time making an app that you sell for $0.99 but you would need to sell about a thousand of them just to break even (since Apple takes such a huge cut, plus it costs more money to service a thousand people than it does to serve one). Furthermore your cash flow is much more predictable under a SaaS model (hence, easier to raise on, exit with, hire on, or just plain sleep at night with) so it isn't even a 1:1000 ratio. More like 1:2000.<p>The psychology behind this is pretty simple. Most business owners know that saving time increases their billable hours. If you can do that, then great. They would be thrilled to hear that they will be paying you that 12 bucks for the next 4 years, because it would mean that they survived at least that long! Most of them think there is a good chance that they will be toast in their first 3 or 4 months, and what's $40 bucks compared to their other expenses?<p>Whereas a general app purchaser isn't costing in their saved time (for business or productivity apps), since they don't view their mobile device as a work tool, and consumers don't usually care that your game is good because their are plenty of alternatives to choose from when it comes to wasting time on the internet.<p>Where I would build an app:<p>For an existing product that exists in a browser, mostly as a sales gen tool. Possibly for functionality that people would like to be mobile but doesn't work in a traditional SaaS app (check-ins for a ticketing app, for example, could be done on an iPad).<p>Most other cases I just wouldn't bother.<p>[1] I'd say 1.5 to 2% is basically the floor because that is roughly what small businesses close at.",1343084719

I agree that logging is good, and don't want to give a wrong impression on that, but, logging <i>everything</i> can have some problems. Users regularly clicko the username/password fields and you'll get exploitable logs of: odd username from IP followed shortly by real user name from same ip with successful log-in.  If you don't secure your logs well, you now have a potential security breach, and those log systems can be vulnerable to all the stuff you went through that password securing rigamorole to avoid (bad software, sql injection, etc, etc.) I bring it up, because a lot of times people don't think to secure the logging system as much as the other stuff, partly because it is regularly behind the dmz, and partly because it is just off the standard security map for user security issues.<p>Just $.02 for this conversation :)",1343084608
4283484,comment,4282348,4282348,4,0,blackhole,,,"My own approach to this problem would be to consider each tile as a square polygon, then simply project the vertices outward from the light source. Then you take the resulting triangles and rasterize them on to an image scaled such that each pixel represents a tile and use antialiasing (or simply rasterize them on to an image 8 times as large as you need it and scale down, which is essentially the same thing). This gives you roughly the same end result, but would allow you to hardware accelerate almost every single aspect and avoids all the artifacts of shadowmapping. Notably, by restricting each polygon to a square, the projection could be done entirely as a vertex shader, without requiring geometry shaders. This would likely be vastly more efficient due to taking advantage of hardware acceleration.",1343084575

2. Keeping track of data/analytic resources in one place.  I'm talking things like databases/software, tutorials, methods, case studies, and books.  I like tracking these things for reference and to help others.<p>Proposed solution: a website with 2 initial parts:
1. a digg/hacker news/reddit part where users can submit links and vote them up or down.  Could possibly include comments and an Ask HN equivalent.
2. an organized list of resources.  People could submit their favorites.<p>What do you think...
1. Is there a need?  Would you use this?
2. I'm thinking of creating a minimum viable product with WordPress on a shared server since I have limited web dev skills, limited budget, and trying to launch sooner than later.  Is this stupid?  If so, which part - WP, shared server, or both?
3. Having people submit links is good but this would need moderation, especially comments. Would you skip this?   Maybe take an approach like R - Blogger where posts from other authors are automatically submitted based on key words AND comments are turned off.<p>Thank you - Brian",1343084514

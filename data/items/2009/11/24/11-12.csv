Bing accounted for 9.9 per cent of searches in the US in October, up from 8.4 per cent at its launch, according to ComScore.<p>James Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp Europe and Asia, hinted last week that the company was making progress with its online plans. “We think that there’s a very exciting marketplace, potentially a wholesale market place for digital journalism that we’ll be developing,” he said",1259063924

Javascript combines several elements that give it a reach for high power.<p>* Javascript is a prototype-based language. I find this to be a better way to write software than other approaches.<p>* There's a good ometa implementation for javascript. Ometa is a powerful ways of writing domain specific languages.<p>* Modern JVMs support javascript, meaning that anything you do in javascript can be adapter to leverage existing Java codebases.<p>* Combination of javascript on both the client and server will likely expose new possibilities. For example, I've been thinking about the possibility of a 'builder' app in javascript whereby you use a firebug console to dynamically build a form and attach business logic to it and then freeze it back to the server. Yes, you could do it at the moment, but it's less effort if you only have one codebase to think about. The thread of bloat in the client becomes less of a problem with new approaches to development like Google Gears, also.<p>Node.js is an important foundation to javascript establishing itself as a viable server-side language. At a glance, it looks to be a good balance of what's needed, also.",1259060981

Decorate the hell out of them with boxes indicating they don't meet quality standards, but if just one person thought it was notable enough to write about, it deserves to be included. Inclusion need not lead to information dilution.

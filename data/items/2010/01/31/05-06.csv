That battle didn't turn out too well for him, but it was fun to watch. It would be fun to see Apple and Google go at it.<p>The history of the PC vs. Mac wars showed us that an open platform (as in able to be installed on any non-apple device) wins over a closed platform controlled by one company. It will be interested to see what happens this time around.",1264917436

They hardly ever used the computers I set up for them and would routinely update/replace whenever I returned over two decades but they dived right into the iPhone. My mom had a 3GS before I did.<p>The learning curve was not as steep and the rewards for learning the device were more direct and obvious.  Anyone can eventually learn to use a computer running Linux, OS X, or Windows if they really have to, but there is a big difference between needing to learn how to use something and getting past that initial hump so quickly that you don't even notice it.",1264917416

This is exactly what I've been thinking for the last several days while reading through all the piss and vinegar the technorati on the web have been throwing at the the iPad.<p>The iPad cost $500-$900 and does a few things exceptionally well. (Like hook into iBooks, iTunes and Apple's App Store.)<p>The Modbook on the other hand, starts at ~$1700 and does all that other crap the technorati wanted the iPad to do. I think everyone just wanted Jobs to come out with a tablet computer that was cheap and badass like MacBooks are and, unsurprisingly, that didn't happen.<p>I mean, I'd <i>love</i> it if Chevy held a press conference and said they were going to sell Camaros for $10k. But it won't happen and I'm not going to get all indignant about it.<p>After all, Steve Jobs said himself they couldn't build a computer for $500 that wasn't, ""a piece of crap.""

It's sort of dangerous when it becomes so entrenched that you start to think your actions are <i>by definition</i> non-evil.

But what's wrong with being targeted with something that genuinely piques your interest? People would love to pay for that, because frankly the information we need is not always presented to us right when we need it. Highly efficient advertising is giving people who have something to say, say it to the right person right when they need it.<p>Don't misconstrue this as an endorsement of false or misleading advertising.

If you wish to avoid being considered a 'douche' you have to better optimise your statements to undermine your oponent and remove their credibility. He could have posted a factual account of his unpleasant experiences with Freenode that included a sincere warning to any other organisers of official projects. Instead he overemphasised the importance of showing both sides of the story.<p>If you are going to be negative then it is important to do it well and do it ruthlessly. Don't try to be fair or direct. Play to the crowd and ruthlessly take the moral high ground or it will be taken from you, as is the case here. It is a little ironic but if Bram had been more of a Machiavellian 'meanie' then he would not have been been labeled a 'meanie'. Some of the posts here provide good advice on ways he could have done that.<p>It seems clear that Bram's misfortune warrants a warning for all potential users of the Freenode servers.

If you read a lot of technical books, papers, or other docs formatted for A4/8.5x11 then do not consider any of the smaller e-ink units.<p>The page turn speed is not fast, but since I was used to it from my previous e-ink device I don't find it too much of a bother.  The thing that you lose from a physical book is the ability to scan quickly to a particular section that you then drill down to the page you want.  With e-ink you guess the approximate area and then guess a couple of more times until you get to the right page.  The biggest ""fix"" that could be provided in this case would be for hyperlinks within the doc to work so that you could bounce from the table of contents or index to a specific page.  At least with the DX I can actually go to the page I want though, with reformatted docs on a smaller display (like the use case for the OP software) there was no match between the original page numbers and the actual page number on the reader, so it was a real PITA.<p>Short version: if you read technical docs or papers in PDF format do not consider anything smaller than a DX or iRex.",1264916219

But when somehow they notice they're good at some branch of math - most starts to love it, cause they can beat challange. At least it worked that way for me for math and programming.

I think people should point them out when they see it.<p>edit: I also agree mostly with the hard-headed engineers you brought up. Physics is somewhat useful, but it's also vastly overtaught and overfunded relative to it's practical utility. I'm an AI guy and think we'll get the singularity before any of the fundamental research going on pays off (and that's only a small proportion of the world's wealth being spent on physics education for people who will never find practical use for it).

I thought about going into academia for a while, and started on a Ph.D programme, but then realised that a large chunk of my life would be spent explaining the basics of the subject over and over again to people who may not necessarily be as passionate or excited about it as they could be.<p>I sort of realised eventually that given how expensive going to university is now (9x more expensive than when I went), I'm not necessarily going to be teaching the brightest and best. Instead, I'll be teaching the brightest and the best who also have the willingness to get massively in debt and/or who have rich parents willing to pay for it all. Suddenly, the important moral purpose disappears, and you are left with: well, I could get paid the same amount in about five years time as I get paid now to write code. Why do I want to do this?<p>And I kind of like software as an industry. It's not perfect: there's douchebags and posers and so on. But it's reasonably recession-proof, it's not on a doomed-path-to-hell like lots of industries, it often lets me work on quite interesting problems (often having some satisfaction doing it), most of the people are pretty nice, the bureaucracy is minimal (for me anyway) and the pay is decent.

I have yet to see anything on iPhone close to what the Xbox 360 is capable of. And I am laughing at the claim just like I am laughing at the claims that the PS Vita is just as powerful as the PS3, for example: it's fairly obvious that a game like Uncharted, available on both machines, is way less detailed and less fluid and less post-processed than the PS3 version. You can give the illusion it's ""almost just as good"" but once you factor all the elements mobile games are just relying on small screens to hide a number of visual imperfections that would be obvious and dirty on larger ones.",1349856580

Linear algebra in QM tends to be infinite-dimensional.<p>You don't have to appeal to QM for their usefulness. Function spaces are important in applied and computational mathematics because of their use in understanding integral equations (the theory of integral equations before Hilbert spaces was a giant mess), partial differential equations, calculus of variations, approximation theory, etc. No doubt marshallp will respond that this is all bullshit because it ultimately boils to finite processes running on finite state machines, where there are no infinite sets in sight, let alone infinite dimensions. The equivalent approach to physics would be an extreme form of empiricism, banning the use of concepts like electrons (as some logical positivists actually proposed to do in the early twentieth century) and requiring all physical laws to be stated in terms of directly observable phenomena, whatever that means.",1349856414

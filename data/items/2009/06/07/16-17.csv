Also, its purpose isn't so much to interpret the work itself as it is to look through it and see what it says about the writer and the reader.

645997,comment,645000,645678,0,0,pradocchia,,,"The short answer is that I didn't get into Stanford, and I couldn't justify the cost of other schools. I'd already had the liberal arts education so I didn't need to do that again. I wasn't sure what I wanted to study, didn't want to be doctor or a lawyer, but I also wasn't ready to drop out all together. The state school was cheap, had lots of graduate programs so I knew there would be something interesting to do. And I could always transfer out after a year or two with a perfect GPA.<p>But once I got there and compared notes with my prep school friends who were already in their junior year at various big name schools, I realized I had a good thing going and that transferring out wasn't so attractive after all. If I really needed a pedigree later on, I could acquire one in graduate school.<p>The long answer (?) is that while one half of my family is highly educated, the other half is comprised of tradesmen and small business owners with little formal education. I had a choice--I could have gone to Harvard, had that been my goal. I had all the prerequisites and could have traded on family connections if need be. I had the option, and I opted out. That's a lot easier than standing outside the gates and saying ""I don't need this,"" even though they never would have let me in anyway. I am not that strong.<p>re: professors<p>It's much easier to find and get the attention of good professors when you are a big fish in a little pond. They will find you. Obscure departments are better than big name ones, but even a comp-sci department will have plenty to offer once you get past the hazing. At a no-name school, you trade duller classmates for better access to the faculty. There were a few good students at my university to be sure, but outside the upper level and graduate classes, the mediocrity was astounding. At least I didn't go in expecting big things! Elite schools can be really disappointing that way.<p>re: exciting things<p>This wasn't my route, but two years at a Jesuit monastery somewhere in Europe could be pretty exciting. You could learn Latin and the local language, work alongside the monks (?), and quiz them on their studies. Philology, the precursor to modern linguistics, is very interesting but has high barriers to entry (multiple classical languages). Fields like that are self-selective.<p>Italy has lots of small scale yet sophisticated manufacturing, so that would be an obvious direction were you so inclined. Lots of legal hurdles but it can be done. Take that back to college and you'd be in a class by yourself.",1244391042

I'm willing to believe that we could eliminate some of these ""gymnastics"" by adopting new persistence models but not without paying a cost somewhere else.  Perhaps that cost is only some additional education but I'm not convinced things are that simple.  A decade or two ago many organizations tried proprietary object-oriented databases for various applications in part because they purported to simplify persistence issues.  For some specific applications they did but more often than not the problems they caused their users were worse than the ones they solved and most ultimately decided to settle for app servers and ORM solutions.<p>I've always thought a key barrier to the adoption of systems that support Orthogonal persistence is that it's harder to make applications designed around it perform as efficiently as ones designed to use lower level things like files or databases, partly because many techniques (e.g. efficient working set management, concurrency control, schema change, replication, data archival) are pretty well understood for applications that use the latter on systems like Unix.<p>Maybe there are new opportunities for orthogonal persistence now that distributed cloud storage and computing is becoming popular. Such an OS specifically designed for application providers running on large clusters with S3-style storage could change things.  However none of the systems you mentioned look like good candidates to me for such change.",1244391040

Going from his examples, cultural norms can help some blacks outperform other blacks. But it doesn't actually allow blacks to outperform whites.

It's a very important and critical skill and like any other, it's difficult to become a master, but how are you applying it?<p>For example, let's say you are trying to solve a problem in crystallography.  You need to be a good programmer to come up with a nice refinement algorithm, but without a fundamental understanding of the problem you're trying to solve, you're not going to be able to solve it.  The same goes for financial modeling, or some other kind of optimization problem.<p>In any field you have to keep teaching yourself new skills, since the technologies and approaches change.  Even the foundational knowledge changes, but what education helps you get is a core understanding of depth that allows you to adjust.  There will always be those who can do it without getting a good education, but those are rare, and in the worlds I've lived in, almost non-existent.",1244390587

Now we've got ourselves a truly interesting and worthwhile discussion.)<p>There is also the alternate hypothesis that whenever I debunk your argument, you start pretending you meant something entirely different from the outset.

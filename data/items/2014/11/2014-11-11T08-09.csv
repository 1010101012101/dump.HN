8588950,comment,8588736,8588736,0,0,martinald,,,"Very interesting. The latency may be <10ms which is good enough for most applications.<p>ViaSat1 has an overall capacity of 140Gbit/sec and that was launched in 2011. I&#x27;d imagine that higher capacities are possible (though considering they are very low weight, that may restrict the amount of beams it can push out).<p>However, the continual problem with satellite internet is that the satellites have a life expectancy of 15 years or so. While 140gbit/sec+ is probably enough now, it certainly won&#x27;t be much in a few years time (when you have to consider that the bandwidth is shared across an awful lot of potential users).<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also add that while the proposed market is for areas without current internet connectivity, people do need to realise that a lot of Africa has very good 2G/3G coverage and some areas have very good LTE coverage. The problem historically has been backhaul capacity<p>a) from the towers back
b) from the core network back to the internet<p>a) is still an issue as in Africa most if not all backhaul from the towers is provided via microwave relay and daisy chaining them, which causes capacity problems (most of the West has fibre or similar connecting each tower)<p>b) is slowly being improved with much better fibre runs around Africa.<p>Considering that most very basic smartphones will have LTE chipsets by the time this system is up, it may be more cost effective to use LTE than this system. This system is likely to require expensive ground terminals that need to be fixed in place.",1415696256

Problems that people have had for years. Even with single-executables.<p>You still need to manage privileges. You still need service discovery. You still need to manage the network. You still need to manage data volumes. You still need to manage the environment.<p>Docker provides mechanisms that either solves all of that, or provides information for tools to hook into (e.g. ability to query what ports the currently running containers expose).<p>I agree with you that there is distinct benefit in self-contained executables, and I think you&#x27;ll find a <i>lot</i> of people working with Docker thinks the same. Partly this is part of what Docker gives us: We get to treat a bigger hairball of an environment pretty much like a single entity, even if we&#x27;re not able to slim it down.<p>But partly, note that a lot of the adoption of Go within devops tools appears to at least partially be motivated by the simplicity of distribution and installation from getting static binaries (without having to use C). I prefer Ruby, and find Go to be a ugly, too low level, language, but I definitively understand the appeal Go has when it comes to simplicity.<p>Yet despite having those devops tools as single executables, people want to put them in containers to manage them properly.<p>If anything, I hope and think that things will move even further down this route. For my part, I&#x27;m containerising my desktop environment part by part. There&#x27;s no reason we should not move to far more locked down process environments.",1415696120

He recalls one inmate was paid a pack of cigarettes to attack one sick inmate whose only offense was to ask if their mail could be delivered before bedtime.<p>But Joiner, a 46-year-old convicted killer, saw something that morning that shook even him to his core.<p>On the floor of a small shower stall he was ordered to clean, he saw a single blue canvas shoe and what he later realized was large chunks of human skin.<p>The skin belonged to Darren Rainey, a 50-year-old mentally-ill prisoner whom the guards had handcuffed and locked in the cell the night before. Witnesses and DOC reports indicate Rainey was left in the scalding hot water for hours, allegedly as punishment for defecating in his cell.<p>Joiner, in an interview with the Miami Herald on Tuesday at Columbia Correctional Institution in Lake City, said he could hear Rainey screaming as hot steam filled the unit that night. He also heard the guards taunting Rainey, saying “How do you like your shower?’’<p>---<p>It&#x27;s incredible that we as a society don&#x27;t manage to provide for the mental health even of our own state officials.

Also unlike many others, I consider Go un-elegant to the point of being ugly. In other words, I&#x27;m no expert and no fanboy.<p>What makes Go my go-to language for certain kinds of projects (I&#x27;ll doubtless be using it again) is that it gets shit done. It has the brutal simplicity and hardware proximity (and raw speed) of C combined with the small handful of things that most significantly contribute to make Java better than C: A simple type system, garbage collection, usable string handling and dynamic data structures (arrays and hash maps). Go also has a fairly large, useful library.<p>Multiple return values often including errors make error/exception handling very explicit and in-your-face. When something can go wrong, you the programmer are forced to recognize that and deal with it as soon as the function returns. That&#x27;s a Good Thing IMO. Java-style exception handling, by comparison, looks to me like an elaborate language hack for passing the buck.<p>There&#x27;s a ruthless kind of efficiency in Go&#x27;s surrounding philosophy. There&#x27;s one way to format Go code, you let the utility take care of it and never worry about formating again. The compiler won&#x27;t tolerate various kinds of sloppiness, such as unused imports.<p>As somebody else mentioned, in Go, writing elegant code is not a consideration because it&#x27;s nearly impossible. Well, I&#x27;m sure there are &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; ways to write Go code, but not so obviously that I&#x27;d be tempted to give it a lot of thought. So I tend to just sit there and write code by the bucketful until I&#x27;m done.<p>Finally, the tooling gets the job done, and quickly.

The second option of your false choice is, if anything, an ideal of anarchism (which is what some people in the past or outside of America mean by &quot;libertarianism&quot;), not American Libertarianism. Private property, perhaps the most sacred of American Libertarian tenets, is entirely dependent on being enshrined by law and enforced by violence.<p>Another most sacred American Libertarian tenet is the notion of personal responsibility and credit, that each of us in a free market is solely and entirely to blame for our poverty and deserve all the profit and wealth we obtain, that in a free society society is not responsible for our personal condition nor us for society&#x27;s. How does the importance you give to &quot;when in-grained into society&quot; in your straw-man setup jive with that?<p>Perhaps the important distinction you missed is &quot;American Libertarianism&quot;, as opposed to libertarianism in general, which runs the gamut from Ayn Randian worship of selfishness, laissez-faire capitalism and strong private property rights to libertarian socialism and Libertarian Marxism.",1415693907

I think he makes approximately the same point:<p>> If you are making cars or widgets, you make them one by one.  They proceed through the manufacturing process and you can gain very real efficiencies by paying attention to how the pieces go through the process.  Lean Software Development has chosen to see tasks as pieces.  We carry them through a process and end up with completed products on the other side.<p>> It&#x27;s a nice view of the world, but it is a bit of a lie.  In software development, we are essentially working on the same car or widget continuously, often for years.  We are in the same soup, the same codebase.  We can&#x27;t expect a model based on independence of pieces in manufacturing to be accurate when we are working continuously on a single thing (a codebase) that shows wear over time and needs constant attention.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/2011/05/the-carrying-cost-of-code-taking-lean-seriously.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/201...</a>

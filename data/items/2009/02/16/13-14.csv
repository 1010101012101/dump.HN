482983,comment,482890,482890,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"I've been looking at this project for a couple of months now, mostly because it's the closest you can come to OS X and the Cocoa framework on your Linux PC.<p>A few details for those who'd like to know: GNUStep is a reimpementation of the OpenStep API, which was an effort by Apple and Sun to bring the insanely great NextStep API to your regular workstation (I think my facts may be a little wrong here ; feel free to correct me). Etoile is built using GNUStep, with the desktop model based around the OS X dekstop (check out my desktop and compare it to Etoile: <a href=""http://img136.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture1rn3.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img136.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture1rn3.png</a>).<p>The best part about Etoile is not that you get to use a fast, lightweight, (sorta) modern desktop environment for your favorite open source OS, it's the fact that you get a great oject oriented API similar to Apple's Cocoa for writing applications with. I've been looking at Cocoa for the past month or so, and I can assure you it's a great framework to write desktop apps in. Sure, Objective-C can be a little weird at first, but once you get used to it you'll find it's a very well thought out language. And BTW, GNUStep even has replacements for Apple's XCode and Interface Builder. I don't quite remember what the XCode replacement was called, but the IB replacement is called Gorm (which is <i>not</i> a cool name).<p>Upvoted for awesomeness.",1234792696

I like the idea of a globally available image tied to an email, but I don't like the fact that you are tied to the gravatar system (single point of failure).<p>I'd like to propose an alternative, and would love your feedback.<p>Gravatar associates a url based on the md5 hash of an email - instead I'd like to propose that the domain within the email address, combined with the prefix be used to generate a url. ie bob@test.com could be associated with the avatar at test.com/avatars/bob.jpg<p>It seems that only a few big email providers would have to get on board with this for the majority of people to have such an avatar. And people such a myself who have concerns about owning their online profile can control their avatar by using an email connected to their own domain.<p>What are peoples thoughts on the matter?",1234792020

482966,story,,,14,7,raju,"Ask HN: How do you manage your learning?",,"Hi everyone,<p>I know a lot of articles and discussions have appeared on the art of reading on HN. But I had had this issue for a while now, and was hoping someone out there could help me out.<p>So for starters, I started to learn Haskell late last year from the Real World Haskell book. Being a new-comer to functional programming its taken me almost a month to read and digest 150 pages or so. Smack in the middle of January I landed a new assignment that involved a host of new (Java) technologies, so I had to drop Haskell for a while to catch up on those. I then had to review a book for a author friend.<p>This has been a regular cycle. I start something with great enthusiasm, I am thoroughly enjoying myself, only to have hit a situation where I need to drop it to learn something else. I have half a dozen of so books covering management, finance, self-help on my shelf right now, and I see no way of catching up.<p>I am sure several others out there have the same predicament. I don't have a problem learning, rather I would learn something new everyday. Its just commitments that keep getting in the way.<p>So the question is how do you manage your learning process? How do you find time to read, learn, digest all the varied interests that catch your eye (be it new languages, frameworks, technologies, other areas of interest, hobbies what-have-you).<p>Any suggestions will be welcome.",1234791237

Then, later, when I have the time and inclination to learn about something new, it's there on my list.",1234791201

Another question is if it's illegal (crimes are a specific kind of illegal act). In fact, it isn't illegal at all if there is no money involved.

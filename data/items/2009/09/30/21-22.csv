Firefox extensions are written in XUL which is Javascript+XML last I checked. GreaseMonkey scripts are also written in Javascript.<p>My point was that this is a 'simple' hack and by keeping the solution simple (i.e. a GreaseMonkey script) users of multiple browsers can benefit. Claiming that writing for GreaseMonkey instead of writing for the Firefox Extension 'Framework' is the same as going from C back to ASM is disingenuous (and from my point of view a straw-man).<p>{edit} Personally for 'simple' things like this that just modify the display of the page and don't require significant user interaction (i.e. a preferences pane) I don't feel like there is a need to create a Firefox extension. There are obviously instances were Firefox Extensions are the correct option, especially when you're talking about modifying the behavior of Firefox (like the MAFF extension or the one that tells you Firefox to also save the stylesheets when saving the 'Complete Webpage'), but things like ""replace all the URLs on the page with X"" or ""click on the image to expand it inline instead of opening up the larger image in a new tab/window"" are more suited to a GreaseMonkey script (especially since a wider userbase can take advantage of them) IMO. {/edit}",1254347107

It has more teeth to it when you win and lose, so lawyers are recommended because you may lose your right to appeal if you don't do things correctly during trial.<p>Also, remember that trademarks only exist when used to identify goods in the stream of commerce. A person does not acquire a trademark simply by registering a domain name. Therefore, old-gregg may own the trademark if he was the first to use it to identify goods in the stream of commerce.<p>Side note: if your ""squatter"" is outside the US, you have to  use UDRP because you can't get jurisdiction in VA for ACPA when the person isn't in the US.",1254346432

However, it does cost ~$1300 to file a complaint for 1 domain for a 1 person dispute panel (you can get up to 5 people on a panel.) End-to-end timeline from when you submit the complaint to when you get a judgment is about 30 days (can be up to 60, though.)<p>As already pointed out here, you do need a strong case and a existing trademark. In our case, we were looking to obtain rights to top-level .COM domain that was an acronym of our current site's fullname URL--the acronym was favorable for obvious reasons and we/our users had used the acronym extensively to reference our site.<p>You basically have to prove all three of these things:<p>(i) The domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and<p>(ii) The owner(s) have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and<p>(iii) The domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith. (source: ICANN)<p>If you haven't gotten a response from the owner based on the WHOIS info, you can file a different type of ICANN complaint (free to file this one) that should force the registrar to contact the owner, who will update the WHOIS information. We had gone through this while trying to buy the domain from the squatter and not getting a response. We think he just updated WHOIS info with fictitious contact information again.",1254346365

853750,comment,852938,853247,0,0,dirkstoop,,,"I agree with you in broad lines but would like to raise one nuance that I find essential to the ongoing debate.<p>Many now popular constructs in contemporary language have come forth from – at their time – seemingly illogical mutations.  By banning all seemingly illogical new ways of saying things, or in other words: only letting new constructs that make <i>more</i> sense pass unopposed, we effectively kill a language.  A language that allows for only the most logical and most effective of ways to express ideas has no room for creativity. (I'm referring to creativity <i>with</i> the language, as in playing with the language, e.g. stand up comedy or creative writing; it is perfectly possible to be creative <i>using</i> a dead language, or to write beautiful – syntactically correct – code.)<p>Considering how evolution seems to work, such a 'pure' language is inevitably where we'll end up if we kill off all seemingly illogical new constructs.<p>To bring my point back to where I started:  There are not two groups, one that cares about precision of speech and one that doesn't.  I understand you deliberately simplified your explanation, there are never 'two groups', but I think there's another, more interesting, way to view this difference beyond just stating that there obviously must be a continuum between two extremes.  I pose that we all have a certain tolerance level for how incorrect a construct may be with regard to how we value its addition to the language (is it merely a lame bastardization, like ""I could care less"", or does it have actual merit, like ""to upvote"") for us to accept or reject that construct.<p>If we shoot down ""I could care less"" only because it's unsound – or if you prefer, incorrect or imprecise – we may be smug, but we are definitely being reckless and are doing the language a big disfavor.  If, instead, we point at this wart in someone's copy because its (1) unsound and (2) lacks any merit over the correct version, I don't think that's smug, let alone asinine, at all.",1254346113

The only solution I know is to go to the store to buy ingredients every day or two, which adds an average of half an hour prep time to each meal (assuming you go every two or three meals, optimistically).<p>Also, the first few times I make something, it'll often not be very good, meaning that I have to be prepared to eat a few meals I don't even like, and which take extra time, just to learn a new dish.  If I'm in an experimental mood, that's fine, but most of the time I just want to put in minimal effort and have a nice meal to eat while watching Sons of Anarchy or whatever.<p>I guess the summary is: lots of time, and getting the knowledge of how to make something costs several unenjoyable meals and extra cooking time on top of that.",1254344850

Here in Russia - if I feel curious - I can always look at the book and see how many copies of it have been printed and i.e. assess how mainstream the book is. In the internet book stores number of copies is mentioned as well. If it is an additional printing, it is also stated.<p>On the other hand, I'm amazed at how wide (long-tail) the Western book market is: I could readily buy ""ANSI Common Lisp"" which was 10 years out of print at that moment, and seems like I still can today! Here in Russia, you generally have trouble finding a book 2 years after it is out of print. Early this year I wanted to find a copy of ""The C Programming Language"" which was last printed in 2006 and I couldn't find any. I borrowed one from the library until I found one in the online store; luckily they seem to have made a new printing.",1254344755

Domain prices are all relatively the same price new, but theoretically the next day someone can turn around and sell a new domain for tens of thousands of dollars.<p>If you're doing to make the real estate argument, then new domain purchases should also have variables pricing from the same domain provider such that somekeywords.com is more than gobblygook.com, don't you think?",1254344664

ICANN is clear about what constitutes bad faith: ""circumstances indicating that you have registered or you have acquired the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess of your documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name.""<p>If you aren't registering for the purpose of selling to the complainant, it's not bad faith. And it's hard to have bough it to sell to a TM that didn't exist when you registered.

Psychologist have gotten very good at using a series of questions to figure out basic personality traits. If you could develop a test that generates values which can be shared in a standardized manner with any program, then those programs could all present data in ways that make sense to the user.<p>Example: Macintosh has several different options for how you interact with files (cover flow, collapsible folders, icons) If all of the programs that allow for file interaction knew that I am visual and prefer to see coverflow by default then I'd feel much more at home as an end user becasue my interactions become more consistent no matter what program I am using.<p>Other areas that could benefit: color usage/dialogue boxes.<p>Overall paradigms for file organization - I, for instance am very spatially aware, whereas many people would prefer rigid folder hierarchy as the method of choice for organizing and finding files.",1254344457

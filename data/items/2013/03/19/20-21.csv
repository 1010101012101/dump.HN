5403608,comment,5393588,5402892,1,0,dalke,,,"No, prayer has not been shown to work.<p>Rather, what do you mean by ""work""? If people who pray feel more relaxed, then yes, it works for some people. So does meditation. So does reading a book, or watching a movie. Or playing cards, or talking with friends.<p>If by ""effective"" you mean that people who pray have a higher longevity, higher rate of being cured, etc. then no, it doesn't work. This type of prayer is usually called intercessory prayer.<p>Take for example <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569567"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569567</a> .<p>> Intercessory prayer is widely believed to influence recovery from illness, but claims of benefits are not supported by well-controlled clinical trials. Prior studies have not addressed whether prayer itself or knowledge/certainty that prayer is being provided may influence outcome. We evaluated whether (1) receiving intercessory prayer or (2) being certain of receiving intercessory prayer was associated with uncomplicated recovery after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. ...<p>> CONCLUSIONS: Intercessory prayer itself had no effect on complication-free recovery from CABG, but certainty of receiving intercessory prayer was associated with a higher incidence of complications.<p>Take for another example <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370557"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370557</a> .<p>> OBJECTIVES: To review the effects of intercessory prayer as an additional intervention for people with health problems already receiving routine health care.<p>> AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: These findings are equivocal and, although some of the results of individual studies suggest a positive effect of intercessory prayer, the majority do not and the evidence does not support a recommendation either in favour or against the use of intercessory prayer. We are not convinced that further trials of this intervention should be undertaken and would prefer to see any resources available for such a trial used to investigate other questions in health care.",1363726764
5403607,comment,5400570,5402790,21,0,dgreensp,,,"I disagree.  I worked at Google for a year in 2010, around the time of the first reorgs around social.  They were decimating teams like Calendar, Sites, and other products with millions of users that were stagnating, as far as they were concerned, and building a team 200-strong to take on ""social"" -- whatever that means.  We joked that no one at Google knew what it meant.  We felt Google was deeply clueless about the nature of social networking products.  The restructuring was very top-down and heavy-handed, and it was apparently just the beginning.<p>In fact, if you're looking for hindsight vs reality, I don't think Google and Facebook really <i>were</i> competitors -- until Google decided to build a <i>copy of Facebook's product</i>.  So what if both sites were monetized with ads, whoop-dee-doo.  The overlap in their product functionality and expertise was basically zero.  There's a very abstract connection that comes out of Google's central dogma: We are how people find things on the Internet.  We are how they discover links.  We're their homepage.  What if Facebook takes all of that away?  We have to eat their lunch.<p>Google acted out of some combination of fear, insecurity, and pressure from Wall Street, along with some grandiose thinking about their role in the universe and the threat of Facebook.  I believe the changes inside Google are significant, and also not inevitable or ""what anyone would have done at the time.""  We'll see how the effects play out.",1363726742

Monocultures usually have strong forces that keep them in existence. With bananas, it's an inability to reproduce. With invasive plants like garlic mustard, it's allelopathy. With the industr(ies) we're talking about, it's the existence of massive inter-indusrial coalitions between hardware manufacturers, software companies, infrastructure providers, and the like that instigate the lack of diversity.<p>If cs702 tried to take action by building a competitor, he would have about the same chance of success a sapling in a field of kudzu.

After some more thinking, I think one can always win with 132 in hand by always bidding 33:<p>If O takes the first two, you win the next three for 33 each and win.<p>If O leaves you the first two for 33 each, take centre and a corner. O must take the third to block you. If he also takes the fourth, he must leave open a row that you can complete in two turns.<p>If O takes the first and leaves you the second, pick a corner, or, if O left it, the centre. If O takes the third, he must leave open a row for you to take in two more turns. If he leaves you the third, he can block one row, forcing you to use four X-es.<p>If O leaves you the first, then takes the second, pick centre. If he takes the third, he can't prevent you from completing a row with 3 X-es. If he leaves you the third, he can force you to use at least 4 X-es.<p>I do not rule out further improvements, maybe even to a conclusion that you need less than 100. For example, if O takes centre and corner for 34 each, you must bid 33 to guarantee blocking his win. After that, you can afford bidding 16 next. If you lose that bet, O has at most 16 left, allowing you to win the two squares you need for 17 each, for a total expense of less than 100.",1363726489

Essentially it is analogous to an iterated solution of the three body problem.  50 tiny steps produces a different result to 10 big steps.<p>There was a Google contraption editing game(a Google IO demo?) that suffered from this approach quite badly.  It was a set-up-and-go game which should perform deterministically, but was influenced by variations in frame-rate.<p>The easiest approach to fixing this is simply quantised time.<p><pre><code>    var now = Date.now();\n    while(gameAge < now) {\n       update();\n       gameAge+=stepDuration;\n    }\n    render();\n    //with usual caveats of resyncing if now-gameAge is too large\n</code></pre>\nThe much harder (but possibly ideal) approach is to not even have such a time step at all and move in variable increments calculated at the point of interaction between entities. An example of this would be a snooker simulation which moves in steps when the balls make contact.  Balls slowing, rolling and curving become calculus problems.

There have been many free alternatives for a long time, even before Reader. For example if every Mac user actually used the built in RSS readers that ship with OS X they would have eclipsed the Reader userbase.<p>2. The fact that it is a small niche (and more importantly isn't really growing) probably better explains the ""lack"" of alternatives.<p>The fact of the matter is that when Apple finally kills off the Mac Pro there <i>actually</i> won't be (lega) alternatives, unlike the current situation with RSS where there are plenty of alternatives (its just that Google's was way better). This is my whole point: Google won on quality, decided it wasn't worth it for them, and then exited. Had they priced it from the beginning (either through ads or freemium or whatever), they would have still won in my opinion, and then still killed it. Reader winning and going away has nothing to do with free in my mind: there is just no universe where Google would continue supporting an RSS product because RSS is not a big enough market.<p>I guess my point is that Google would have ""killed the space"" no matter what, not because they made it free.",1363725693

5403468,comment,5403441,5403441,9,0,superjared,,,"Text since the site seems to be having issues:<p>Bye bye PDPC<p>Sadly, we were forced to dissolve PDPC, freenode’s parent organisation.<p>When the organisation transferred across from the US to the UK we wanted to keep the organisational structure as close to what it had been before (change is scary, right?) — however, we made the conscious decision to no longer have any paid employees after Rob Levin passed away. This meant that everyone involved with the organisation were volunteers and we no longer had anyone who could invest the time and effort required to do fundraising and similar tasks, meaning that the organisation was unable to sustain the levels of donations required to obtain and maintain charitable status in the UK.<p>Due to the massive reduction in financial support we found ourselves in a position where being an incorporated organisation cost more than what we were able to bring in in donations and after years of operating at a loss it was decided that we would apply for the dissolution of the corporation in order to drastically reduce costs. The application has been processed and the organisation has been dissolved; to further reduce costs we have also discontinued the majority of infrastructure services for which the organisation paid, together with the reduced administration and organisational fees this means that we are now in a position where our outgoings are restricted to domain renewals! We would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the organisation in the past, users, organisations and staff in particular, who have always been (begrudgingly?) happy to contribute towards the difference in order to cover the deficit.\nWhat does this organisational change mean for freenode?<p>In practise it means very little, the PDPC has never been involved in the day to day operations of the network and there will be no changes to the way in which the network is run. freenode is staffed entirely by volunteers from all over the globe who contribute their time and expertise to keep the network up and running in between contributing to various other FOSS projects.\nWhat about other PDPC projects, such as fosscon, geeknic, and the fossevents site?<p>These projects will continue as they have before, and we invite you to attend fosscon for real world talks and collaboration, to join a geeknic picnic or plan your own at <a href=""http://geeknic.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geeknic.org</a>, and to check out <a href=""http://fossevents.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fossevents.org</a> for events in your neighbourhood and around the world.\nI appreciate the work you do and I still want to contribute<p>The best way in which to help the network is to contribute time — help out in #freenode or elsewhere on the network, assist users in finding answers to their questions and help us try keep the channel and network temperature at a nice, comfortable level which encourages collaboration!\nIf you are low on time but still want to help out you might be able to help us through your company or organisation by becoming a server sponsor (See “Hosting a server” for more information).\nIf you feel that one particular volunteer has helped you out and you want to say thank you — ask them if they have a preferred charity to which you could make a small donation! With time we might update our website to provide links and information of such preferences.\nAlternatively, you may consider donating to one of the following projects:<p><pre><code>    Software Freedom Law Center\n    Electronic Frontier Foundation\n    Open Rights Group\n</code></pre>\nExisting PDPC donor cloaks<p>Existing PDPC donor cloaks will remain valid for a full year, after which they will be converted to unaffiliated cloaks. Ongoing donations will be cancelled by us. If you have previously donated to PDPC you’ll still qualify for your donor cloak as normal. If you believe you’re due a cloak and we haven’t processed it yet please contact us.",1363725607

If you spend your junior professorship time writing a textbook (in a field that already has many) rather than spending that time on more research and publications, tenure is unlikely. If you're tenured and have been teaching the same course for a while, on the other hand, you both have more leeway to spend your time doing that, and may have already sort of ""naturally"" accumulated years worth of notes from previous iterations of the course. Then it can be a good idea, and many senior professors do prefer this approach, because it lets them teach the course in a way precisely in line with how they feel the material should be taught, rather than having to buy into someone else's approach.<p>Universities could influence that outcome at all levels if they wished, though. Universities formally budget preparation time per course. Currently it's typical to budget quite little, because the assumption (and sometimes requirement) is that you'll be teaching using a standard text in the field. If they instead want extensive preparation to be done, along the lines of what you propose, they can: 1) budget sufficient time for it, e.g. specify that each course requires, say, 100 (or 200, or whatever) hours of preparation prior to the beginning of the semester; and 2) expect that the preparation time be used towards the budgeted end (i.e. expect extensive independent course materials to be developed for each course, in line with the amount of time budgeted).",1363724750

So there's real, cryptographic anonymity.<p>The system has a central entity issuing the currency initially AND reissuing it on every change of ownership (to make sure your trading counterparty didn't keep a copy).

I've most recently come across it with a friend trying to start his graphic-design business who was upset about discovering that ""99 designs"" website.  Before that it was a bass player for our band that was strenuously principled that we should never accept a gig ""for exposure"", and should also not play with musicians that had a history of accepting free gigs, since it was ""disrespectful"" to the players that were trying to make a living at it.  While I do agree that there are moderating counterpoints to both, they do bring up relevant concerns.<p>Meanwhile, you have Radiohead and Nine-Inch-Nails, both of whom experimented with releasing their music for free way back when.  When it ""worked"", everyone championed how it was the way forward for the music industry - how music was a ""service"", how the recordings should be loss-leader marketing expenses for the paid service of live performances.  Overlooking the people who were more focused on the recording side of things, and the fact that those two bands had built-in fanbases.  Years later, both bands are moving on from the ""free"" model, while so many people are misguidedly releasing their tracks for free that indie songwriters are <i>paying</i> money to even get their signed-up fans to listen to their new tracks.<p>I'm not so sure that the conclusion is that free works, as it is accepting that free works by being predatory and that there can be consequences that hurt others.  And it isn't exactly ethical to accept a negative consequence on behalf of someone else.  This is not to say that going free is <i>wrong</i> - sometimes there is a bigger picture that might make it worthwhile for all (for instance, many open source techs that have created new marketplaces that have enabled many people to make a living).

If necessary, a similar line would have been added to every employment agreement signed by every corporate employee upon being hired.</i><p>Yes, you're right, in a practical sense this is what would happen. But that just underscores how broken corporate governance is now. The legal fiction of a ""corporation"" is abused in all manner of ways. IMO it would be better to restrict what ""corporations"", particularly publicly traded ones, can do with corporate money, and how broad their charters can be. But that's really a legislative fix, not a judicial one.",1363724455

Granted it can take up to hours for a payment to become fully confirmed, but this is the cryptographic specie being transfered from one individual party to the other. It is a lot more direct on this account than even a fast bank transfer, because in that you still only have a receivable against your bank, much like equivalent ones in todays credit system denominating in USD, etc.<p>Plus you have the safety that no-one can inflate much value out of the currency, because it is specie-based.

5403258,comment,5391667,5402900,9,0,sha90,,,"> It is tiring to translate thoughts, experiences, and feelings into a digestible and understandable format.<p>This is a very telling statement-- it's also somewhat ironic, given that one could easily interpret this as a passive aggressive jab at OP's ""inability"" to communicate. One could ALSO interpret this as a general sentiment about the importance of vocabulary. So either you did not communicate this point precisely enough, or you intentionally left it vague as some intelligent ploy to poke at the flaws in your own argument. I'll go with the latter cause it sounds more meta.<p>The actual issue is that it isn't about difficulty. It's actually <i>impossible</i> to translate thoughts in a predictable manner across racial, gender, and cultural lines. We are not machines, and so people interpret statements, and, in some cases, jokes, in the way that they are brought up to interpret them. In a victim-culture, jokes are usually interpreted as malicious devices. The problem here is that while some call for equality and understanding of other cultures/genders/races, this usually only applies to the cultures that are victimized. Equality is a two-way street, and understanding semantics is an important step to equality, because in order to respect, you must first understand. Just because culture/gender X makes a dongle joke, does not mean that culture/gender X <i>meant</i> the dongle joke as some insult to culture/gender Y, even though culture/gender Y might interpret it that way. We (all) have to put effort to understand things in the right contexts, so a dick joke between two guys (with no assumption that women are eavesdropping) is just that-- a dick joke between two guys-- it is not an assault on women (especially given the fact that it seems like it wasn't even meant to be heard by anybody else). Some leeway ought to be given to the interpretation of words, just as you should be reading the OP's text as it was intended, not simply as the words aligned on the page.<p>That said, I actually love how this very statement ties back to the original issue at hand so perfectly, even though it was some tangential argument about semantics, so thank you for pointing this out.",1363723408

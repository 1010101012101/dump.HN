People who he had to convince to make his successes happen.  What is it that he has that enables him to overcome these challenges and succeed?

6261073,comment,6258422,6260889,5,0,icambron,,,"> if a given test were to generate a false positive, you would expect that it wouldn&#x27;t generate a false positive the next time if run on the same article<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. Remember that the test doesn&#x27;t actually detect bombs. It detects certain chemicals. Now, sometimes it might just randomly report a false positive and then you&#x27;d expect it not to trigger the second time. But some of the chemicals it is built to detect can be found in everyday products, such as hair products, soaps, some medications, and--as I learned today--bug spray. And so for those chemicals, it&#x27;s going trigger repeatedly because the chemical it&#x27;s looking for really is there. So that second failure mode is actually pretty common, and so even when that happens, it&#x27;s normal to take the person into a side room, search them more throughly, talk to them for a few minutes, and send them on their way. What we see here is quite different.<p>Which leads us to the real reason, which you wrote:<p>> It&#x27;s not that such behavior is automatically suspicious, it&#x27;s that the behavior is still almost indistinguishable from those who previously have caused terrorist attacks.<p>That&#x27;s precisely profiling: &quot;the bad guys have profile x and you fit profile x, so we think you are suspicious&quot; where x isn&#x27;t inherently suspicious. It sounds like you&#x27;re saying, &quot;profiling isn&#x27;t such a bad idea&quot;, which I strongly disagree with, but I suppose that&#x27;s a different discussion.",1377219252

I&#x27;m not from Switzerland, but used their train system for a week a month ago.)<p>They have an excellent web site and app, first up. It allows you to set departure and destination, earliest departure time (if you don&#x27;t want to leave before 10am, say) or latest arrival time (i.e., so you can make a flight), tweak routing and see every detail to the minute. You can get print-outs (if required) telling you what to do and when. The platforms for arrivals and departures are set rather than vague as in many other countries so you know exactly what&#x27;s happening in advance.<p>I&#x27;m confident that they&#x27;ve worked nation-wide to coordinate arrivals and departures to ease passage for the absolute majority of people. Each train change is aware of the distance between platforms so that it might allow two minutes to cross platform to another train, or seven minutes if you need to move a bit further. You don&#x27;t get stuck waiting for 30 minutes or have two minutes to cross six platforms. (We were travelling with an infant and a lot of luggage that meant changing trains was traumatic - in Switzerland, it was a dream.)<p>In one very handy sequence, we caught a series of two gondolas down a mountain, switched to a bus, then a train, then another train. Waiting time was barely there - it was brilliant. Trains seemed to leave shortly after you got to them, like the world was designed around you. People were joining or leaving on other routes too and seemed to have a similar experience.<p>I got the impression that popular routes were optimised to minimise walking distance between platforms, but could&#x27;ve been imagining that.<p>Another handy thing was that every platform access had stairs in one direction and a ramp in the other. The underground systems in London, Paris, etc were no where near as handy for people with luggage or prams, often not even having lifts for disabled access.",1377218851

Experienced developers comprehend JavaScript&#x27;s attempt at it just fine. This understanding doesn&#x27;t change its inferiority, however. This is exactly why so many developers need to compensate for JavaScript&#x27;s lack of desired functionality in this area by trying to fake class-based OO using the limited functionality that JavaScript does offer.<p>The same goes for many other aspects of JavaScript.

Yes, there has been some advancement, but web apps are still inferior in every respect.<p>The performance of web apps is much worse than that of desktop apps, for example. Complex desktop apps written in C, VB, and PowerBuilder ran just fine on 486 or early Pentium systems that have a very small fraction of the processing power and resources of a modern system. Yet it&#x27;s still common to see web apps in general perform quite poorly on these modern systems, while doing less than the mid-1990s apps did.<p>Developers at least have some choices when it comes to desktop apps. They can use a multitude of different languages, along with a variety of different libraries and frameworks. This is a much richer ecosystem than what we get with web development today, where you&#x27;re basically stuck with JavaScript, or a language that&#x27;s nothing more than a slight veneer over JavaScript (CoffeeScript, TypeScript, and even Dart). Don&#x27;t even bother mentioning asm.js or Emscripten. Asm.js is merely a rancid subset of JavaScript, and Emscripten is experimental at best.<p>The portability argument isn&#x27;t even valid. Languages like C, C++ and Python offer superb portability today, especially if used with one of the extremely cross-platform GUI toolkits available for making desktop apps. Given that almost every major JavaScript implementation today is written in C and/or C++, the portability of JavaScript is inherently no better than than of C and C++.<p>The ability to communicate over a network isn&#x27;t anything special, either. All sorts of desktop apps have been doing this for several decades now.<p>The distribution argument also isn&#x27;t valid. The package management systems offered by most Linux distributions, for example, are far nicer to work with. They make it trivial to find and install native apps, and unlike web apps, you get to choose if and when you upgrade, rather than having changes forced upon you time and time again.<p>The sandbox argument is also irrelevant. Various mainframe and UNIX-like OSes have offered several different ways of jailing or otherwise isolating processes for many, many years now. It&#x27;s nothing new. But unlike the browser, they give real control over how much access is allowed, and without imposing horrid performance loss.<p>All of these limitations of web apps come together to make for a user experience that isn&#x27;t enjoyable.<p>At best, web apps can imitate desktop apps, usually at a quality and user experience level 10 to 15 years behind desktop apps. It&#x27;s objectively incorrect to claim that web apps &quot;rival&quot; desktop apps, when all of the evidence shows that they clearly do not.",1377216759

Of course, I don&#x27;t mean that this is an actual problem, but just that with more people writing code, the community has more people being generally shitty.<p>Furthermore, the general shittiness of post-y2k developers has seeped into the corporate veins of tech companies everywhere. So this is why you see Go &quot;gunning&quot; for Ruby or Rust &quot;gunning&quot; for Go, or whatever. And I speak from experience. When I was in my late teens (I&#x27;m 27 now), I totally thought Javascript sucked; and, in many senses, it&#x27;s not an ideal language. But I mean, I was <i>really</i> out there with my shitty (and uninformed) opinion that JS sucks.<p>Fast-forward a couple of years after I forced myself to do a lot of development with many (many) languages -- as opposed to being force-fed X or Y language by Z company -- and I have a different outlook. There are very few languages (or frameworks, for that matter) that <i>suck</i> -- furthermore, saying X sucks is simply insulting the (probably much smarter than you) author of X. This doesn&#x27;t happen much on HN (people usually have well-thought out opinions) but it&#x27;s very apparent on SO or the myriad of other forums/newsgroups.<p>I now love JS. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing or anything, but I&#x27;ve been having as much fun writing JS as I&#x27;ve had writing C (which is saying a lot -- C is <i>very</i> fun). If I <i>could</i> get a freebie, though, I&#x27;d have to say that C++ sucks :P<p>So I agree with the sentiment of the OP and I think this is more prevalent now rather than 10 or 20 years ago because we have a much larger community of developers.

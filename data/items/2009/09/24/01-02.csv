The memes were just a part of the larger community that was /b/.<p>What I find funny is that you can see 4chan's community spreading to other sites. Reddit is now fully infested with meme generation, and it's just started to have the same set of people artificially creating memes and getting scolded by long-time users. I'm curious to see how Reddit survives, considering it both has user-based content moderation and subreddits to stave off the so-called cancer.<p>Now, of course, Hacker News has recently made the tip into memeage, and I'd suspect within a year we see a meme or two that's become a big part of the site.

I used dates and ""The Three Bears"" for a light example of variable naming that almost anyone could understand.  I did not even begin to address ""better code"".  I'll save that for another (or hundreds of other) posts.<p><i>Your Mama Bear example is some seriously broken date iteration code (so you change lastDay from within doSomething?).</i><p>The code is fine.  It only becomes ""seriously broken"" if you change the loop variable within the iteration, in which case you seriously broke it with poor practice.<p><i>The Baby Bear code's naming is a bit off too. Is it inclusive or exclusive?</i><p>The naming is fine.  So is the code.  Your question of inclusivity or exclusivity is meaningless without understanding the assignment of the iteration variables, which again, was outside the scope of the post.<p><i>The letter 'y' is obvious</i><p>No it's not obvious.  That's the whole point.  It's extremely poor practice (See Papa Bear example.)  You cannot assume the poor sucker who maintains your code will know what ""y"" means.  And Heaven help him if he tries to do a global search for that variable in 2,000 lines of code.  Which may lead him to reuse it inside the iteration.  Which is just about the only way to ""seriously break"" it as in your Mama Bear complaint.<p>Your revisions will cause exactly the problem I was demonstrating to avoid.",1253755394

No one is clamouring to give skinheads tax exempt status as non-profit/religious outfits.<p>Scientology tries to maintain a veneer of legitimacy while in reality, being pretty damn shady. By and large, I suspect they seem far more hypocritical to Anonymous, et al than many other questionable fringe groups, such as skinheads. If there's anything that really sets off activism on the Interwebs, it seems to be hypocrisy.<p>Plus have you actually read about the beliefs and teachings they push while demanding that people pay for the privilege of receiving them?

I don't want to hurt any hacker's emotions but I feel ""freedom of information"" should end where it endangers those people's lives who are working for their countries, whether soldiers or diplomats.
Freedom of information and expose MUST be for common man's good, not just for gaining publicity.
Expose the wrong, not the mundane.Otherwise it's pure eavesdropping and bragging about your power to do so. 
Diplomacy IS ""the art and practice of conducting negotiations between nations"" (as defined by Merriam Webster dictionary). That is precisely what all the exposed diplomatic cables were doing.Anything wrong with that?
If I study hard to get a job in foreign services and someday, somewhere, someone decides to divulge my confidential, professional conversations just for the heck of it, and it destroys my reputation then what it should be called? Expose or public titillation? 
And if freedom of information or ""openness"" is so vital then why WikiLeak's founder guards his privacy so fiercely? One rule for others, one for himself?",1291726489

Which is in fact perfectly quantifiable; it's just hard to give a good justification for whatever particular quantifying you do.<p>My reasoning, for what it's worth, goes as follows.<p>It's surely impossible to make a coin that literally always comes up heads no matter how you toss it. (Imagine that you contrive to send it vertically into the air with no spin at all. It will come down the same way as it went up.) So let's charitably interpret my hypothetical friend's claim as something like ""if you toss this in a normal sort of way, it'll come up heads at least 99% of the time"". That seems like it might be achievable with something that looks like a normal coin. Now, how likely is that given only that (1) it looks like a normal coin and (2) my friend has told me what he has?<p>Well, now it's time to pluck numbers from the air, in an attempt to quantify my beliefs about biased coins and my friend's trustworthiness and so forth. I suppose I think there's about a 50% chance that it's actually possible to make a coin that behaves as described. If so, it probably isn't particularly hard to figure out how to do so, in which case the makers of magic tricks and practical jokes and suchlike will surely do it and sell the fake coins at a reasonable price. Except that in most countries it's a serious offence to sell fake currency, so really convincing fake coins would have to come from abroad and be shipped in surreptitiously. Let's say a 10% chance, given that such coins are possible and not too expensive to make, that it's commercially worth while for someone to do that.<p>Now, my friend is purely hypothetical, so who knows what his character and interests might be? Let's suppose he's known to be interested in this sort of thing. Then perhaps he's about equally likely to procure such a coin, if it exists, as to play a joke on me by claiming to have such a coin and just hoping it comes up heads. (Of course if no such coins exist then he'll certainly do the latter.)<p>So, my prior probability for the coin's being fake in the appropriate way is about 1/20.<p>Now Pr(coin is fake|heads) / Pr(coin is normal|heads) = Pr(coin is fake) / Pr(coin is normal) times Pr(heads|coin is fake) / Pr(heads | coin is normal). That's 1/20 times 0.99/0.5, or about 1/10.<p>So, before the coin toss I'd have given roughly 20:1 odds against the coin's being fake; after it, roughly 10:1.<p>(Note: I have deliberately done the calculations only very roughly. That's usually good enough in practice, and all my prior probabilities are crude estimates anyway.)<p>Of course, if (e.g.) my friend starts offering suitable bets on the outcome of the next few tosses, that will itself be evidence that the coin really is fake. So if you happen to have such a coin, you won't be able to cheat me out of as much money as you might hope :-).",1291724276

It's the basics - the ability to problem solve, learn and adapt to new environments that are truly important and timeless.<p>Sure, being exposed to a new set of languages and tools can have some start-up penalty. But if it takes someone more than a few weeks (< 3) to be good at Scala, Ruby, Python, etc then there is something wrong. Running through a complete tutorial and solving real problems on a real codebase over a couple of weeks should be more than enough time to become proficient with a specific language if you already have the skills of being able to problem-solve.<p>Don't confuse choice in your ecosystem of tools for quality. Just because there are tens of thousands of libraries for Java and .Net doesn't mean they are all good or that you can automatically choose the good ones.<p>The beauty of a more recently popular languages is that smart people tend to be attracted to them and, in my experience, they tend to create better quality libraries and tools, even though they are less of them.",1291723659

There are so many unknowable, uncontrollable factors that make the difference between life and death, to the extent that you play Russian Roulette with each climb, the only reward being a spectacular view.<p>I saw Touching the Void (recommended) a few months ago and it described how on one occasion two climbers basically climbed onto a snow overhang and when it broke it was too late to do anything about it. There was no way to know that they were heading onto an overhang at the time, it looked solid as anything else. This is not a skills-based discipline, just crazy gambling. I don't get it.",1291723261

That can get you back into the field, and can help you make good pay and determine where you&#x27;d want to land. Good QA people are hard to find, but the position has a sort of limit career wise. In addition, you could consider a position as product manager which has a higher growth career path. Just my 2 cents.",1394895502

Promises were probably added because of all the existing code out there.<p>Again, generators in and of themselves don&#x27;t do anything (for async code). Something needs to be generated/yielded, and that thing is the reification of an asynchronous operation. Such as a promise[0]. Generators and promises fulfil different roles, generators are used as imperative &quot;sugar&quot; for chaining promises.<p>The generators you yield will ultimately resolve into a series of async operations (promises or &quot;thunks&quot;), yielding a generator is convenience (not very useful convenience either, since `yield*` exists the ability to yield generators just complexifies the driver)<p>[0] and in the case of co a &quot;thunk&quot;[1], because node",1394894871

It&#x27;s quite difficult to burn nuclear grade graphite, and it might actually act as a moderator for the fallout and help to control what&#x27;s happening randomly.<p>Maybe the solution is to dump a moderator over the area and seed it with organisms and see if something takes hold? Either way, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be an intractable problem if one is a bit lax in terms of long term uncertainty.

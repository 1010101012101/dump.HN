You increase &quot;velocity&quot; by strategically decreasing your development effort, but this leaves out the idea of technical debt completely. I&#x27;ve start to believe there are things that will kill you in the short term (bugs), medium term (missing features), and long term (architectural issues). You can play with the percentage of effort put towards each area in every version/release, but neglecting any one for too long can kill the product. It seems easier to explain the balancing act to people that way.",1371362334

I used my PS3 as my primary desktop for a long time, and liked the ability to reboot for games.<p>I eventually needed it more as a Netflix box, so the desktop got replaced. I haven&#x27;t bought anything from Sony since.<p>The move was more than just inconvenience. The presence of an OtherOS feature in a major DRM platform was an olive branch. Sony was saying its proprietary system could happily coexist with open systems. By removing this feature, they sent the message that coexistence was impossible. They don&#x27;t encourage installing non-Sony software on any devices they sell now as far as I know.<p>Maybe we&#x27;ll find some way to restore the truce, but it has to come from their side.

A bit of Googling corroborates this [1], but if there&#x27;s evidence I&#x27;d be curious to hear it.<p>If King&#x27;s &quot;communist leanings&quot; didn&#x27;t exist then they could hardly have been &quot;the main reason for wire-tapping him&quot; or indeed the reason for anything at all.

My personal view is that cities of the present are essentially anachronisms spawned from 20th century post-industrialism intertia: artifacts of outmoded labour markets, planning laws and now-quaint geospatial efficiencies.<p>As the cost of living in cities rises due to the shortage of land, the requirement for importing food and water, and the artificiality of maintaining a reasonable healthy lifestyle in high density urban environment, my bet is that, broadly speaking, emerging labour markets (our type of industry, for example) based on new technologies for communications and a reformed education system will cause a mass migration of professionals <i>away</i> from cities, back to a more sustainable, decentralized model.

The only federal piece is the Supreme Court of Canada. Jurisdictions that have no provincial police force (all of them except Ontario and Quebec) contract the RCMP to do their policing but technically could contract it to anyone they want. Arrest warrants are not generally valid outside the province they&#x27;re issued in (although Canada-wide warrants can be issued in extraordinary circumstances). Municipal police forces receive their authority from the province that they&#x27;re in. So in theory, the Alberta government (for example), could hire the Montana Highway Patrol to be their police force if they so desired.<p>In short, every jurisdiction in Canada has one and only one agency responsible for enforcing the Criminal Code, and that may be a municipal police force, a provincial force, or the RCMP contracted by a province, depending on where you are. So unlike the USA, the RCMP is not like the FBI in that it does not have any additional powers to any other police agency, just a different jurisdiction.",1371361406

5887546,comment,5886690,5886690,5,0,ScottBurson,,,"The reason petitions like this are important is that ultimately, the fate of whistleblowers must rest in the hands of the people.  The government <i>must</i> prosecute leakers; failure to do so would invite rampant leaking, placing essential secrecy in the hands of every single individual with access to confidential information.  The key question about a leak is: does the value of the information being public outweigh the cost to national security?  The ultimate arbiter of this question can only be the people.  The executive branch is too invested in maintaining security; the judicial branch is charged with enforcing the law, not with making policy judgments; and the legislative branch, while it can be very influential, has (at least in the US) no direct control over the fate of any particular whistleblower.<p>So the only way to keep a whistleblower out of prison has to be by the sheer weight of public opinion.  There isn&#x27;t any other way and there never can be.  This is one responsibility we cannot delegate to our elected representatives, because it directly contradicts other responsibilities we have placed on them.<p>So, if you believe, as I do, that we are better off for Snowden&#x27;s revelations -- that we desperately need to have a national conversation about what our government is doing to protect us, and whether the price of that is worth paying; that the material Snowden has leaked has been essential in bringing that conversation into focus and drawing attention to it; and that the damage to national security is minimal -- then I urge you to sign this petition.",1371360217

I even have trouble with really basic things sometimes, like styled bullet lists, where something will just randomly get messed up. And the default bullet is this dot smaller than a period. What&#x27;s up with that?<p>Again, though, the killer is getting .docx files from people and having them be Completely Broken in OO. I tried working with OO for several years, but finally gave up in frustration. I&#x27;m sure I wasted more than 40 hours fighting with it, which would have paid for my Windows AND Office licenses several times over.<p>>Eclipse, NetBeans, Emacs, KDevelop<p>Eclipse is about the worst development environment I&#x27;ve ever been cursed to need to use (for Android development -- thank all that&#x27;s holy they&#x27;re officially supporting IntelliJ now).

Read this whole article; towards the end, it reports that acting AG James Comey, along with FBI Director Robert Mueller, threatened to resign if NSA continued slurping Internet metadata out of American signals intercepts on orders from David Addington, a Cheney henchman.<p>Gellman&#x27;s underselling the drama here a bit, but he captured it in _Angler_. Comey and Mueller didn&#x27;t just threaten to resign. First, Comey simply refused to authorize the program. Comey was acting AG at the time because John Ashcroft --- a punching bag figure for civil libertarians (like myself) --- was hospitalized with appendicitis, doped up, and incapacitated. When Comey pushed back on the Addington order, future AG Alberto Gonzalez went to hospital to try to get Ashcroft to override Comey. Ashcroft, who Gellman (IIRC) reported was barely lucid, refused to override Comey. Comey and Mueller threatened to resign. The rest is history.<p>It is really hard to fathom just how bad the first Bush administration --- really, the Cheney shadow administration, which is what it was in the first term --- was. The last time mass senior resignations were a tool of influence in Washington was Watergate.<p>Incidentally: Comey and Mueller were both Republicans. From everything else we know about NSA surveillance post 9/11, we have every reason to believe that Addington&#x27;s plan was stupid, but not much reason to believe its goal was to target anything other than foreign terrorists. Both Comey and Mueller were prepared to resign, from a Republican administration, over what most Americans would consider a legal technicality --- in a program whose goal they supported, and whose harm to the American people was abstract.

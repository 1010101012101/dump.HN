4067825,comment,4067297,4067363,5,0,astrodust,,,"It's important to remember that pre-IPO Google was a vastly different company than post-IPO Google. It wasn't just the Eric Schmidt factor, which cannot be ignored, but the way the company seemed to position itself. With billions in the bank they could take more risks, explore new markets, and branch out in somewhat unpredictable ways.<p>In 2004 Google Maps didn't exist. Android was an independent entity. The Google server farms were still few and far between. It was a search-based advertising company and nothing more. You could argue they're still fundamentally the same, but that's just because they have a rock-solid foundation to expand from.<p>Facebook in 2020 could be a completely different company and who knows, maybe a $500B one.",1338883124

4067816,comment,4067297,4067431,19,0,pwang,,,"I actually think this is backwards: The primary reason why Facebook can be successful is because it is organized such that it <i>could</i> realize the vision of a technical founder, who has a foot in tech and a foot in business.<p>You're right that they haven't tried to make money yet. I once raged to a friend at Google that Facebook's use of ads displayed an utter lack of creativity or seriousness about building a business. (I also argued that Google <i>should not</i> try to tackle Facebook on its home turf, but if it really wanted to attack it head-on, it would need to build a destination site instead of merely ""socializing"" all their products. Sadly, that destination site turned out to be G+, and then they used it to socialize their products.)<p>There are two Facebooks. One is an identity service, built on a noisy social graph accreted over the years, which Zuckerburg is hoping to make as fundamental as DNS for the modern non-anonymized web. The other is a micro-blogging and photo sharing site on top of that identity service. Both are going to be hard to make money with.<p>It is really difficult to directly monetize the core identity service. They can attempt to provide the service as a bona fide piece of Internet technology (e.g. opening up retail locations to verify accounts in-person, or by partnering with wireless providers that sell their eventual phone), but then governments and others will get into the act and require open API access to the user information and graph data. As soon as that happens, they've given out their crown jewels.<p>Any other mechanism for monetizing the identity service is tantamount to providing advertising on the back of your driver's license, or making your social security card into a frequent-diner loyalty card. People won't like it, privacy advocates and anti-corporate doomsayers will have a field day, and governments will start interfering with their core tech.  (A good strategy for Google might be to work on a stealth, open-ID based ""Plan B"" to have in their back pocket, for the day if/when Facebook does shoot itself in this foot like this. They've certainly screwed the privacy pooch before.)<p>And as for the other half of Facebook, they are in a crowded, fickle space, and their offering there isn't actually that great (and I say that as a user and a technologist). Twitter, Pinterest, and a host of small startups are very real threats. Mark paid $1B to keep Instagram from Twitter and maybe Google; how many more of those can he afford? Furthermore, Apple has enough <i>cash</i> in the bank to buy two Facebooks, even at its massively inflated P/E, and its gaming platform is tied to a much broader, more sustainable group of customers than Zynga's ""whales"". I've personally spent over $100 on iOS games - and barely noticed that that was the case. It was easy, casual, natural, and I will probably continue to dump more money into the iOS ecosystem, because it works great. I've spent exactly $1.98 to buy two Zynga games, mostly to get rid of the annoying ads, and I've stopped playing both.<p>Lastly, Amazon, whose customer profiles include credit cards and addresses, and whose social information is tied in to actual purchasing intent, has yet to reveal the punchline in its Kindle strategy. Just as 'selling books' was not the ultimate purpose of the company, I am fairly certain that 'reading books' is not the ultimate purpose of the Kindle. One concept: A Kindle fire with a barcode scanner turns every single aisle in every brick & mortar store in the country (with 3G signal) into a showroom for Amazon. Add passive background RFID scanning as the user walks the aisles, and it's a brave new world of retail.<p>TLDR: Mark is a smart and capable guy, now backed with fresh cash, but he's got to apply some creative thinking to demonstrate that he can actually milk his cash cow. His worst case scenario is to become basically Verisign, and I have not seen them demonstrate any new thinking to suggest this will not be the case.",1338882957

4067814,comment,4065167,4065167,4,0,westicle,,,"At the risk of being slightly off-topic, I had a recent personal experience with a groupon clone (lets call it deals dot com dot au, or ""the site"" for the sake of this story) which might be of interest.<p>I purchased four service-based ""deals"" through deals the site. It eventuated that the business advertising the deals did not exist, had never existed, and was consequently unable to provide the services offered.<p>I was disappointed and contacted the site asking for a refund. They brusquely rebuffed my request for a refund and instead offered a ""site credit"" for future deals. I politely indicated that I didn't want a site credit and would prefer my money back. They insisted that their policy was to give only credits.<p>Fortunately I work in commercial law and could direct them to the relevant provisions of Australian consumer protection law which they were breaching. They quickly refunded my money.<p>Lessons:<p>1. These deals businesses are very reliant on doing extensive due diligence on their clients, and can easily be ripped off by an unscrupulous merchant. In my case they ate a loss of 150% on the value of deals purchased (full refund to me, 50% share to the merchant).<p>2. In order to minimise their losses this site was willing to break the law and outright deceive its customers about their rights. If I were more pugnacious I could have caused them some trouble. Unfortunately most of the customers they try to rip off probably aren't commercial lawyers and they get away with it.<p>My lasting impression: very difficult industry to turn a profit in, strong incentive to scummy business practices and the attendant legal risk those practices bring. I wouldn't invest.",1338882855

(I would like to note that I have never personally used Play) As far as I know, Play has not gained the traction that other event driven frameworks have. This has a lot to do with the fact that Play didn't really start to come to light until after Node.JS started to explode and server-side javascript became heralded as the second coming of Christ (by some, not most).<p><i>And why are all these companies ignoring the fact that there is a shortage of Ruby and Python developers because most college students are learning Java?</i>\nBecause it doesn't matter what the college students are learning. Java is a good language to teach OOP with. But that doesn't mean it is always the best tool for the job.<p><i>Very few of these colleges have a single class that teaches web development. For someone who wants to pursue a career in web development, this is highly discouraging because I feel I am not learning the technologies I need for a job (such as Ruby and Python).</i>\nYou aren't learning them. Just like you probably won't learn the technologies you need for the next job you want at your current job. Welcome to development. Never stop learning. You stop learning, you're dead. I'm serious. Who knows what the cool thing will be five years from now? Doesn't matter, you're going to have to learn it anyway.<p>I would like to elaborate further, but don't have the time at the moment.

Unless you have the source (in a human-readable form) and have the right to compile it on your own, this is a shaky ground to rely scientifiy results on.<p>This is not an issue if you use that software for dicovering stuff. But it is a huge problem for e.g. mathematical proofs, or statistical analysis in other fields.<p>Note that I'm not saying that proprietary software has more bugs. But it's a problem if your result depends on using a black-box whose creators hide their implementation from you. Also, even if your may read their code, this is worthless unless you are allowed to compile your own version from that.<p>Also note that the same issue exists with hardware, but the question whether your processor adds and multiplies correctly is on a totally different level than whether complex algorithms have been implemented correctly.",1338879775

I mean, what's more important, innovating and giving people a technology which will improve their lives, or forcing them to use a website in which to show them cat pictures and click on context-aware advertisements?",1338879725

Roads change, weather conditions change, etc.<p>'Know' here doesn't mean just knowing the road as in a map. OP meant 'know' (I presume) in the sense that: the data on how the street view driver drove through that road and under what conditions (including weather, traffic, et al.) is learnt by the machine learning algorithm.",1338879708

4067684,comment,4067372,4067606,18,0,bhickey,,,"Rent control is screwing things up in the first place.<p>For example, without the option to end leases landlord's can't empty a building, demolish it and rebuild with more units. This imposes an artificial constraint on supply. Demand isn't particularly elastic so prices rise.<p>Meanwhile, the price ceiling encourages overconsumption amongst the rent control population. Kids are off to college -- why downgrade from a 3-bedroom? There's simply no incentive to do so. This further limits supply.<p>If you want to see rents fall, repeal rent control, repeal Prop 13 and allow construction.",1338879646

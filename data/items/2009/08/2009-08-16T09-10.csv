I don't the stats myself, but thousands of times each year doesn't sound too far off.<p>But at a place like Cal Tech, when this happens once, the school DROPS THE HAMMER on the student body for a time to try and head it off from happening again.  At Princeton, where I went to school and worked, that meant a flood of counselors, town hall meetings in all the dorms, a spate of articles in the papers, etc.  Wall to wall discussion to make sure that if you know someone who's struggling, they get some help. This emphasis fades of course, and who knows how effective it really is, but I do know that numbers at the counseling centers would shoot up for a time as students were encouraged and felt comfortable seeking help.<p>So if you run a school and this happens three times in 3 months, I imagine the administration would be pretty upset and worried.",1250415765

This takes energy, a larger freezer will take more, an empty one will take less than a full one.<p>Counteracting the heat transferred through the freezer walls from the outside in will require an amount of energy proportional to the mass in the freezer and the leakage from the outside.<p>It takes energy to maintain that imbalance, the bigger the imbalance the faster the heat will transfer.<p>If the stuff in the freezer is light (air) then it will take less energy to keep it cold than if the stuff in the freezer is heavy (ice), because there simply is less leakage from air (a thermal insulator) to the walls than there is from ice (a pretty good thermal conductor).<p>Thermal conductivity is not very tightly coupled to mass but it usually is a good indicator, in the case of ice vs air it works pretty good.<p>So, it takes more energy to keep a freezer full of ice at a low temperature than a freezer full of air...<p>For an encore, which is heavier: A cubic meter of dry air vs a cubic meter of humid air ?",1250415120

How can you debug what is happening?  I'm going to take two seconds and run strace on the program to see what files the process is trying to open.  You're going to... read some docs?  Post a question on a message board?<p>Or suppose that your Python program tries to do an open(""foobar"", ""w"") but the open fails with:<p><pre><code>   IOError: [Errno 26] Text file busy: 'test'
</code></pre>
I'm going to look at the manpage for open(2) to figure out what this error means.  You're going to... go ask somebody who understands system software?<p>People who don't understand system software are totally helpless compared to people who do.  You may see C fading into history.  What I see is every single relevant technological innovation -- 2nd-gen JavaScript interpreters, Flash, the JVM, .NET, browsers, OS's -- ALL using C or C++.<p>I would challenge you to look around and find ANY stack of software that doesn't have C or C++ in it.  It's just a matter of how deep you have to go to find it.  Are you saying that we shouldn't equip students to deal with layers of software that deep?  Are you saying we shouldn't equip them to understand things like trace compiling, which are the state of the art in language design and implementation?<p>Sure, if all you want to do is web development, you can probably go a long ways without understanding system software.

I mean the resource used to access the resource that is to be gotten] often? For a commonly interactively accessed thing, it would introduce a lot of latency for clients to get it every time, so I suppose it must be cached... and then the cache of the parent resource be refreshed regularly and in case of failure? How far up the tree should that go?<p>In other words, if I want to get the Twitter feed for Joe's ""ABC"" group and I don't want to hardcode the URL for that resource, how often should I download (and cache), parse, and traverse the resources for Twitter's users then Joe's feed then Joe's ABC group, etc.?

The steps stay the same: build a basic app with help (from a book, tutorial, etc.) to understand the framework/language, start building what you want to create and learn at the same time.<p>What I'd suggest is to obtain a copy of ""Agile Web Development with Rails (4th edition)"" (<a href=""http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with...</a>). Side note: it's not published yet, so make sure you get the beta version (an e-book version, and you'll be notified of updates as content is modified/added).<p>Then read through the book while building the example application in the book (a basic shopping website). This approach is great, because you learn by doing and you also get to glance at agile methodologies.<p>Once you've gone through the toy app and understood it, you'll be quite proud of yourself and will be able to build simple things already.<p>At this point, you should start to work on your own idea, it's much more motivating and you'll always learn the most when working on a ""real"" project.<p>To be noted: the Rails book does assume you have passing familiarity with Ruby (or at least a programing language), HTML, etc. If you need/want to learn programming first, you should probably also get an appropriate book on the subject, such as ""Learn to Program (2nd edition)"" (<a href=""http://pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program</a>) or, if you're more advanced, the Pickaxe (<a href=""http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9</a>).<p>Oh, and the reason I mention PragProg books isn't because I'm affiliated with them (I'm not), but because I have yet to get one of their books that doesn't live up to my expectations.",1287251587

It was clear that he was making an RSS feed of changes to a web page, but the process of selecting the dynamic elements of the target page was unclear to me.  And several times he had to say things like, ""Oh, it's confused now.  We'll just fix that...""<p>So maybe you came to the right conclusion that <i>the rest of the world is stupid.</i>  Or maybe Dapper was a little difficult to use, and the value proposition was a little vague, and it never really took off.

1798397,comment,1798359,1798359,0,0,btilly,,,"This is something I thought about back in the 90s.  Here is a simple thought experiment.  Suppose that there was a computer selling for $1,000,000 that was equivalent to a human.  With a 5 year amortization schedule, said computer would be equivalent to paying someone $200,000/year.  Not really a threat to humans.<p>Fast forward 3 years.  After two generations of Moore's Law, said computer now costs $250,000, and can profitably replace people worth $50,000/year.  Previous generations of technology always had the result that there are other things humans can be trained to do more easily than you can build machines to do it, so humans move.  But there is nothing you can train displaced people to do that the computer can't do as well.  What happens?<p>Fast forward another 3 years.  Most people are unemployed because they can't do anything that those with money can't get done with machines.  In theory there is enough excess capacity for everyone.  In practice investors will demand returns and efficiency, and attempts at economic redistribution have never succeeded.<p>There are a lot of arguments against this.<p>A common one is based on the concept of competitive advantage and the benefits of free trade.  Adding robots is therefore good.  However that argument has a major flaw.  It is true that with 2 parties, if you open up free trade then both benefit.  It is true that with 3 parties, opening up free trade leaves everyone better off.  However it is <i>also</i> possible (and fairly common) that free trade with 3 parties works to the advantage of two, and the disadvantage of the third.  (For a real world example, look at the long-term economic decline along the silk road after Europe began trading directly with Asia via ships.)<p>A second one is based on history.  It is true that every advance in technology has left people better off.  But that is because there was always something that people had a comparative advantage over machines at that people really wanted.  And the cause of our comparative advantage is our intelligence.  If machines can supply that, then we cannot demand a salary that is greater than the value of the resources needed to do the same job with machines.  Once that happens, Moore's Law is _not_ our friend any more.",1287251290

>If, before a test, you imply that the women should expect to do a little worse than the men, that hurts performance. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>This sounds like a specific form of a general psychological result that would hold true for men too. If so then this article is beyond disingenuous it is a flat lie. That aside in order for the result to have a bearing on real world test scores it would require someone to be telling women just before their maths test that they're going to fail. Who's doing that, it would be pretty easy to spot in a school and certainly in my country a teacher doing that would lose their jobs.
*/<p>It does hold true for men -- specifically, men of African-American and Hispanic descent, when reminded that minorities generally do worse on math exams before the exam is given.<p>The proposition that nobody is telling women they're going to do worse on math tests, however, is simplistic.  It isn't that some mean old guy is telling them they suck (although one of my female physics professors mentioned, out of the classroom, that she had been thrown out of a physics class at Georgia Tech in the early 1970's for ""taking a man's spot"" -- you're right that this sort of thing is much less common these days, at least in the West).  It's that the whole culture is suffused with the attitude that women's mathematical abilities are suspect -- witness threads like these, which appear over and over on the interwebs, discussing whether or not women are as capable as men at math.<p>Measuring maths ability scientifically and publishing the results, rather than relying on folk-science and anecdote, could help encourage women to trust their own desires and abilities mathematically -- even when faced with a predominantly male culture and continual doubt being cast on their abilities to function at the highest levels.<p>I know this to be true because I am now a lone female coder in a group of (really great, smart, delightful) guys, loving my work on a complex, challenging system. And I remember that I dropped out of the very first coding class I took after a few weeks because I was completely intimidated by the swaggering guy classmates who threw around terms I wasn't yet familiar with -- I felt out of place and was full of self-doubt.  It was only after maturing and understanding the social dynamics that I retook the class and ended up with one of the top 5 grades, out of several hundred students.  Yet, at first, I had been certain I was incapable -- not because any guys were mean to me (not one was anything but helpful), but because I doubted myself, and felt alone and weird.<p>And surely this isn't gender-specific, and surely many geeky coders can relate, and have probably had similar experiences in different areas of life. This isn't a woman-man thing only -- it's a specific expression of a general human tendency to reflect cultural attitudes about their lives in the images they create of themselves.",1287250152

You'll hear about an earthquake on trending topics before any media outlet.<p>6 - Following privacy paranoid real life friends.  Twitter has a dead simple privacy model.  Either people can publicly see your feed, or they have to approve you.  Some people I know got fed up with the Facebook privacy shell game and switch to Twitter for this.<p>7 - Connecting with a loosely coupled community.  For those of us not in the valley, finding fellow hackers can be troublesome, and when you do, you don't really need a heavy connection, but following each other on twitter is a nice lightweight way to see if the local tech event is going to be hacker or muggle heavy.<p>8 - Location based chat for conferences.  Hashtags allow for people to mark a discussion about anything, and a lot of meetups will tell you the recommended hashtag so you can see what people are discussing in a specific place.<p>I hate is the whole ""Twitter is just people talking about what they had for breakfast"" complaint, it really just meant you are following boring people.  There actually exist a non-trivial set of people I know whom I am friends with on Facebook (and real life) but wouldn't follow on twitter because they're tweeting about stuff I have no interest in.",1287249132

If I was in a position to hire, I'm looking for people who can solve problems, not those who can remember the Java API in their head.

My plan, given university constraints, is to never once offer a written final. I've not once taken an exam where I was confident just writing code down. It doesn't make sense. Offer them a final on a computer with Internet access, but with a sufficiently difficult problem that it can't just be Googled for a complete answer. Their web access logs are turned in with their exam, so I can see if they copied something if it looks suspect, or if they're borderline I can give extra credit for going through a mental process that shows promise.",1287249006

Here's why:<p>* Low perceived value. People know how to create pdf e-books. Just choose ‘Save As’ in MS Word. So it has a low perceived value. Much lower than the $13 real book you can buy from Amazon. This means you cannot charge a high price for your pdf e-book.<p>* They’re static. Once they’re out there, they’re out there. You cannot add stuff, correct material or fix typos.<p>* As you mentioned, they’re (way) too easy targets for piracy.<p>* Lots of people don’t want to read anymore. They want to watch videos instead. So might as well add some video.<p>* No analytics. Which chapter is most popular? You will never know.<p>* No interaction. People read a chapter in your e-book and have clarifying questions. But alas – no interaction is possible.<p>So that's why I think online courses are the way to go.<p>How to create an online course and sell it?

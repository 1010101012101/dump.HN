That's what human traders do as well.<p>Human traders hold securities for more than fractions of a second. If I want to sell my shares of some low volume stock today and some other human investor wants to buy them next month, a third party who is willing to buy them from me today and sell them to the other buyer in a month is providing a useful service -- I get paid today, he gets the shares at a slight discount and makes a profit a month from now. That clearly doesn't apply when a high frequency trader buys shares and turns them around in fractions of a second.<p>>They don't ""deserve"" it any more or less than any other middle man.<p>A middle man deserves the profit he earns by providing value.

There's time for a comeback.  There's no age limit on making a comeback, but I don't think it would be an outrageous claim to say that bouncing back at 30 is easier than bouncing back at 50.  Of course, as is the case in most things, attitude matters.  A lot.

Can they ""legitimately"" own a patent and then spin-off a troll with that patent as its only asset?<p>Spin offs aren't mergers. If you create a new entity as a spin off and transfer patents to it, it wouldn't be the original assignee anymore, so it would have to practice the invention. A spin off that doesn't practice the invention is a patent troll.<p>>Or what if the original inventor own only part of the company?<p>It doesn't matter who owns the company, it matters who owns the patent. If it's owned entirely by either the inventors listed on the patent, or the first company they assigned the patent to immediately on issuance (typically their employer), then they wouldn't need to practice the invention. If it's anyone else then they would need to practice the invention. A company's single exclusive designated successor stands in for the original company if the original company ceases to exist. You can't split up the patents in any way or else all but the designated one of the new owner(s) will have to practice the invention.<p>> Anytime you give property rights to someone but then try to restrict them, there will always be away to wriggle around the restrictions when sufficient money is at stake.<p>Any time there is money on the table someone will try to take it. That's a poor argument for not doing anything about it.<p>>Eliminating software patents might indeed be a good, crude decisions which is better than the status quo, but the abstract nature of software does not in principle prevent novel, patent-worthy ideas from being reliably identified.<p>Software itself is an abstraction. The only types of patents that software could infringe are patents on mathematics itself (e.g. compression or crypto patents) or patents on abstract ideas that can be built on top of mathematical primitives, because that is all software is. It's abstractions built on abstractions built on abstractions built on mathematics. And none of that is even supposed to be patentable. Contrary to popular belief, patents aren't supposed to be granted for ideas, they're granted for <i>inventions</i>. An idea isn't an invention, the invention is the thing you make after you have an idea. You patent a nuclear reactor design, not E=mc^2.<p>The ""problem"" with software is that there are arbitrarily many practical inventions that implement a given idea. Patenting any partial subset of the possible implementations would be pointless, because any competent programmer could come up with a hundred other different ones that implement the same idea. But patenting the idea itself goes too far. Which is what they've been allowing and what causes all of these problems. It's why in software accidental infringement is the rule rather than the exception and as a consequence everything infringes everything.<p>People have intuitively understood this forever. It's for exactly this reason that literary works aren't patentable, because it would cause the exact same thing. But software makes peoples' brains explode because we created virtual worlds where you can go simulate human interaction and even buy and sell fake stuff for real money, and at some point we went from calling those interactive works of fiction names like World of Warcraft and Second Life and to calling them names like YouTube and Facebook and the App Store.<p>At some point we lost track of the line that distinguishes a patentable device that physically holds your CD collection from an unpatentable work of interactive fiction that allows you to see a picture of such a device on your screen and pretend to interact with it, and we started issuing patents for simulated ""inventions"" that exist solely as abstract ideas in software literary works. But it was never supposed to be this way because of exactly the mess that allowing that has caused.",1362025631

5296952,comment,5295223,5295223,1,0,cromwellian,,,"The key problem with Google Now is that you have to remember to look at it, and so, most people don't get the benefit as much as they should. The act of having to physically remove the phone, unlock it, to see contextual Now card notifications IMHO is a transaction cost that makes it less likely you'll use it effectively.<p>You need to be able to see and dismiss a contextual notification within a second, like a warning light in a cockpit. It should be effortless and almost second nature.<p>That's one reason why the glass, or going further, direct-mind-machine interface, would be better - speed. Latency matters. I am often deterred by the time it takes to unlock a phone to perform an action. For example, I once witnessed a car accident and wanted to snap a picture, but it took too long to get my phone out, and I missed the moment. Other times, I want to translate something I'm looking at, but bringing up an app to do it is just too annoying. Look at the way the characters in Star Trek the Next Generation call on the computer to answer questions as if it is always just there for the asking. That's the kind of responsiveness you want.<p>I think a lot of people assume that a device that sits on your face would be ""always on"", constantly distracting you, but I'd argue that the ideal device is one that is out of your way, but activates extremely quickly on demand, or contextually as appropriate, like a subconscious subroutine or personal assistant.<p>Too much effort I think is focused on immediate mass mainstream adoption. It's as if, you can't have an iPhone level sales volume, it's not even worth doing. But there are lots of things worth doing that the masses don't necessarily adopt out of the gate.  Someone needs to lay the foundation that the future is built on, that other people can build on. Google Glass doesn't need to ""kill"" the iPhone to succeed.",1362025102

Vertical rhythm is mostly unimportant EXCEPT when you have text printed back-to-back on paper (you must ensure every line of text aligns so that bleed through isn't as distracting), or when you have multiple columns of text or facing pages. That is, it is really important for books and newspapers.<p>Notice that the links in the left-hand column do not use the same vertical rhythm so the baselines of the links do not align with the baselines of the main text. That is the type of bad effect that vertical rhythm is supposed to help avoid. But, I bet most visitors didn't notice it and weren't bothered by it.<p>Most implementations of ""vertical rhythm"" on the internet for a single column of text result in vertical gaps that are unnecessarily large. That is, implementing this concept is often counter-productive for must web pages.

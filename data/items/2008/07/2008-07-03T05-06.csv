You could be right.<p>Hitchens on the Iraq war is a little puzzling, I agree. I think it has perhaps more to do with his own evolution than with the matter as such. It's hard to imagine him supporting that war many years earlier.<p>Anyway, as I said, I like his writing. Looking over that quote page you linked to, I ran across this quintessential statement, about Michael Moore:<p><i>Europeans think Americans are fat, vulgar, greedy, stupid, ambitious and ignorant and so on. And they've taken as their own, as their representative American, someone who actually embodies all of those qualities.</i><p>I just think that's brilliant. And it makes me laugh. Ok, now I'm really going to get flamed... I had better stop.",1215064372

I think you've raised a really good point, and there are two really good counter-arguments I've seen so far to working 80 hours a week:<p>1) 80 hours isn't always more productive than 60 hours of someone else's time, and in fact may be counter-productive.<p>2) What do you have to show for after 10 years of playing the startup lottery?  In your best case: you probably have a huge bank account, but no life left at that point.<p>I think this deserves a separate discussion.  I'll keep this in the back of my head and think it over, post up another response when the time's right.  At either rate, it's cool to see your guys' feedback.",1215064297
234948,comment,234784,234922,0,0,nickb,,,"There have been so many double blind tests of various codecs (just browse here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec_listening_test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec_listening_test</a> ) and they all show that vast majority of people simply cannot tell the difference between 256kbps MP3 and a CD (certainly not within two standard deviations). Sure, some golden ear guys can tell but even they have hard time coming to two standard deviations.<p>Also, some music actually sounds better as MP3s! Yes, strange...<p><i>The fact that some of the 128 kbps samples were consistently judged to be better than their original CD counterparts by this skilled group – even by the best among them – stunned our editor (who participated in the test although his results were not included in the evaluation, and had to confess that he got only 15 points). It seems safe to declare that there is no musical genre that is especially well-suited or ill-suited to compression. It is apparent that there are quite other factors related to the technical aspects of recording that will later adversely affect the results at low bit rates.</i><p>Finally, most of the people listen to their music on portable players and/or computers and speakers on those are so bad that you can't really tell the difference between 128kbps and 256kbps. Double blind tests show that there's no statistical significance when you listen on these devices.<p>So yeah, NY's latest 'better than CD' ploy might work out with audiophiles... same people who buy $400 digital cables and $500 wooden knobs so their music sounds better.<p>In the end, it all comes down to good mastering and not codecs and delivery medium. Modern music is heavily compressed and there's a lot of clipping and that has nothing to do with MP3s.",1215064163

234946,comment,234777,234875,0,0,staunch,,,"I may be mistaken, but I'm not using the term ""strawman"" incorrectly. I believe his portrayal of an overly extreme and super naive entrpreneur is intentionally used so that it's easily refuted. How many startup founders feel the work they're doing is so unbearable as to consider it ""evil""?<p>> <i>I know people with no money who never worry about money, and I know people with pots of money who worry constantly.</i><p>This seems really bogus. I know poor people, wealthy people, and ultra rich people. The kinds of things they each worry about are totally different. Sure, they may all technically ""worry"" about money, but that's where the similarity ends.<p>> <i>You've got an education, a skillset, and a salary that is the envy of the world, so what are you so afraid of?</i><p>A serious medical condition with myself, a family member, or a friend. Generally any problem that would prevent me from being able to work for an extended period of time. You don't have to be paranoid to worry about this. Unfortunately, it's just not that rare.<p>More personally I'm afraid of having to significantly limit my interests to fall within relatively limited amounts of expendable time and money or to things that are profitable.",1215064125
234945,comment,234784,234884,0,0,rms,,,">Vast majority of the population can't even tell the difference between 128kbps and 192bps.<p>That is true. However, I think most people could be taught to tell the difference on proper equipment, if they were given a double blind test and they heard at the 50th percentile or better.<p>There is a very real difference between 128 and 192 kbps MP3s in the sound quality that you can really perceive. In 128 kbps MP3s you lose all sounds above 16khz. With 192 kbps there is enough headroom to keep most of the way to 22.1khz which is the frequency limit of CDs. On some very loud passages (like most modern music) a V0 lame MP3 would probably start rolling off the upper frequencies.<p>192 kbps with variable bit rate is plenty of sound quality for distribution on the internet. You just can never re-encode it so you don't own the music quite as much as if you had the original CDs.<p>Since I doubt Neil Young is promoting ideally encoded MP3s, you're probably right about the red herring.",1215064056

But the motivations of ordinary men don't change from place to place, and the various arab defenders and the vietnamese communists are almost surely identical morally. His defense of the Iraqi war is pure mind-fuck. I'm not completely against the war, but I understand its grand strategic purpose: To secure vast and necessary oil reserves from encroachment by Russia and China (the latter has been securing incredible resources in Africa, for example. This is no small threat.) But what's his motivation?--it's impossible to say. He just seems inspired by dead ideology.<p>[1] There was no shortage of atrocities or terrorist acts committed by the vietcong. I understand this as asymmetrical warfare.

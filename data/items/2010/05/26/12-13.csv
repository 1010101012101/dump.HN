My interpretation (IANAL) of sectoin 7.2 of the Apple Developer License is that you are not allowed to distribute your apps anyway other than through the App store.  But if you are distibuting the source code, as required by GPL v2, that doesn't seem to be infringing to me.  Of course, maybe someone can point to an example of Apple harassing someone that was doing this.<p>Of course, maybe the FSF is getting all upset about the fact that not just anyone can download code onto an iPhone., only those in  the Apple Developer Program?  Except I personally find that situation as similar to needing to have a piece of hardware to use software designed for that hardware. If I use GPL code that I have modified such that it will only run on a PS3, I'm not obliged to furnish users with a PS3...",1274876396

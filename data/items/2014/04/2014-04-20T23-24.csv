The <i>reason</i> it&#x27;s more rational to take salary is because you get paid even if the startup tanks; if you&#x27;re a startup founder and your primary goal is to prevent the startup from tanking, you want your people to take equity as much as possible so they have every incentive not to let it fail.<p>The original question was about signaling, and here&#x27;s the problem with wanting to do a startup and yet get paid mostly in salary: it exists in a bit of a no-man&#x27;s-land as far as risk tolerance goes, where you still face significant risk of being out of a job and yet don&#x27;t get the upside of startup success.

Every instruction would be this type of branching instruction and it could handle calculations by performing table look ups. 15+ years ago people had even written assemblers and emulators to demonstrate the theory.

You prove your theorems more or less by typing out the proofs and the system mechanically verifies that each step in your proof is sound. I&#x27;ve used Coq and I&#x27;ll be honest. This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample. This has been successful enough that there are companies like JASPER and OneSpin which make money by selling hardware companies formal verification tools.<p>I worked with JASPER&#x27;s tools in the recent-ish past and one of the big things they seem to have done is make the tool much more usable. With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting. And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://minisat.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minisat.se/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://z3.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://z3.codeplex.com/</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/</a>",1398036173

The compiler would still have to be modified to do the propagation, and a machine code model and verifier constructed, but theoretically this would be easier than proving the whole thing works correctly.<p>I guess Typed Assembly Language works along these lines:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc/</a><p>but I haven&#x27;t read up on the papers, and it seems outdated.<p>My imaginary end goal (not that I&#x27;d be able to do anything remotely as ambitious myself, but I still like to think about it) is an operating system where all code is run in kernel mode after being checked for safety - like Singularity OS but without trusting a compiler.<p>Perhaps that trust doesn&#x27;t actually matter very much, since the compiler is unlikely to contain too many exploitable bugs (AFAIK most Java vulnerabilities are not related to the JIT, for instance), and there are plenty of other places in such an operating system bugs could hide anyway.  But it&#x27;s inelegant to require all code to go through a single compiler.  For example, it would be cooler if the assembly verifier were not baked into the system, but simply a program proven to correctly check whether some code is safe in the machine code model; if you (any user) could prove a JIT never generates unsafe code, you could submit the JIT in place of the verifier, and run wild with it without going through any slow compilation or verification processes.",1398036133

Sure when walking around enjoy the scenery, but when you&#x27;re waiting in line by yourself at the same place every week maybe it&#x27;s okay to enjoy your smartphone.<p>If you have friends and family that use their smartphone in front of you, politely ask them what&#x27;s wrong and if they need to excuse themselves to a more private location. Even for texting more than a few minutes, one should have at least the courtesy to leave the table and step into a hallway.",1398034998

Random sitting somewhere on the network between me and my recipient can&#x27;t just run Snort and read the shit out on their screen. So that the connection can&#x27;t be easily routed to somewhere else and grab the data. With email as it is today, these things are possible for a reasonably intelligent middle schooler.<p>Yeah, CA system is shit. but they are better than nothing. I don&#x27;t trust it won&#x27;t be compromised by a government NSL, but I trust it enough that I&#x27;ll pay for ebay crap over SSL at a coffee shop and not worry that the guy next to me is sniffing my credit card number.<p>Here&#x27;s  what starting over means to me: you don&#x27;t break something that basically works. If you start adding incompatible changes to email, then it splits the network. Instead create a parallel network with minimum standards attached to it (for instance,) and maybe nobody will use it but it also won&#x27;t break anything.",1398034941

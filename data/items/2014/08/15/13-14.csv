Due to a combination of long commutes to suburban high schools, a little burnout, and a growing need for diversity in my working life, I am considering changing careers to something related to the tech sector. Based on my English degree and work experience, I think corporate training or technical writing jobs would best use my existing skill set. For those of you who have experience working in or hiring these types of positions, I would appreciate your advice on how to proceed in terms of upskilling, certification, and how / where to pitch myself.<p>With regard to training roles, I am already comfortable working with large groups and presenting complex information to novices. However, I don&#x27;t know how much emphasis is placed on instructional ability as opposed to content / product familiarity. Similarly, both writing and editing are central to my skillset, but I would like to know what other skills may be valuable for  technical writers. For example, I&#x27;ve seen a number of positions calling for front-end web development skills. I have some modest HTML/CSS and LaTeX experience, but are there other specific technologies that I should invest time in learning?<p>Though I would love to find something before this fall, realistically I expect to start another ten month teaching contract in September. This gives me some time to consider certification programs, MOOCs, or other resources that you suggest. In addition to your thoughts on the specific jobs mentioned earlier, I&#x27;m open to suggestions for other roles that might fit my skills. Finally, I&#x27;m based in Seattle, so any Seattle-specific advice would be most welcome.",1408110782

My undergrad institute called this &quot;The Thayer&quot; method and required students to do the reading before class and show up ready to discuss. There were often even homework assignments based on the work that was not covered in class yet to force pre-reading. Class time was then a productive discussion and a chance to ask questions.  During class students would be asked to &quot;Take boards&quot; and perform math or chemistry calculations immediately and on their own so that the teacher can assess the class&#x27;s progress. This school also offered chemistry and engineering classes which will never work at Minerva because of the lab requirements. A liberal arts degree should include a basic chemistry + lab course, but I don&#x27;t see this working with the program they describe.<p>To me Minerva appears to have a sound business model based on bringing foreign students in for an education with low overhead.

Four specially programmed seed robots are then added to the edge of the group, marking the position and orientation of the shape. These seed robots emit a message that propagates to each robot in the blob and allows them to know how “far” away from the seed they are and their relative coordinates. Robots on the edge of the blob then follow the edge until they reach the desired location in the shape that is growing in successive layers from the seed.<p>The algorithm had to account for unreliable robots that are pushed out of their desired location or block other robots performing their functions. Nagpal’s team overcame this challenge by implementing strategies that allowed robots to rely on their neighbours to cooperatively monitor for faults. They also avoided relying too heavily on exact positioning within the shape boundaries.</i>",1408110092

8182026,comment,8181339,8181339,62,0,enziobodoni,,,"I think what is important is the LACK of critical articles out there. Where was the counterpoint in this article, or the recent Fortune article. I run a hospital laboratory in Seattle, and I am a clinical pathologist. Like Elizabeth Holmes, I studied Chemistry at Stanford, although I did graduate. Everyone in the lab world is a-twitter about Theranos right now, up to the CEOs of the big companies, largely because no one knows what they are doing. Everyone who goes and talks to them, including interviews for a job, signs a CDA, so this isn&#x27;t surprising. However, there are several things we can know:\n1- the big name folks on the board are Hoover Institution connections. No surprise there, I knew all those guys were there when I was at Stanford, and she was connected with them early. The person who commented about the importance for these links when it comes to FDA problems is right on.\n2- what these people are doing for lab testing, in terms of technology, sounds totally revolutionary IF YOU DON&#x27;T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CLINICAL LABS. If you did know, you would understand that most of our routine instruments ALREADY use a couple microliters for an assay, and that results are available in seconds to minutes. There has never been an article about Holmes that mentions this. What she has done with microfluidics is to reduce dead volume quite a bit to allow overall lower sample volumes, but this is an evolutionary, not revolutionary, change to instrumentation. It is also of dubious clinical value (more on this later).\n3- the fact that they list their prices IS revolutionary, and it&#x27;s the best thing about the company. I wish I could do at for my lab. Secrecy of pricing is one of the major problems with Us healthcare.\n4- no one writing any of these articles about her understands that fingerstick blood is not the same as venous blood. It is blood mixed with interstitial fluid from the tip of the finger. The results of tests are different for analytes in venous bold and fingerstick blood. Thus,they need to do a clinical validation that their results are meaningful, in addition to an analytical validation to prove that they&#x27;re accurate. This is where the FDA, as they did to 23andme, is going to get involved, unless Don Rumsfeld can head them off. If LAb Developed Tests get regulated in the coming years, though, they are totally screwed, just like I am.\n5- many people don&#x27;t know that you can already get lab tests done on finger stick blood, ie prick your finger at home and mail in the blood or take it to participating Walmarts. The reason for this, I suspect, is that the companies that do this are not headed by an attractive blond woman and enveloped in the shroud of mystery of a Silicon Valley.<p>I will be interested to see how long it takes before a serious &quot;the emperor has no clothes&quot; article will come out in a mass media outlet, and someone who actually runs a lab or knows any of the rules of running labs is asked even one question. It is much less sexy of a story when told that way, so maybe never.",1408109523

I got the feeling that there was more cool tech stuff going on at London universities, but word never really got round to us.

It's essentially digital while a painting is analog, really analog. How the pigments that form the various colors interact with each other varies so much. Even just take red for example, there's red paint made with cadmium, some with iron oxide, others with plants, pyrrole, etc. All these different types of red act so differently. Red on a monitor is just defined by 8 bits, typically.<p>But with all that said, this was another lifetime ago for me.

1736786,comment,1735947,1736571,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think you need to separate your factual statements from your value judgments.<p>On a factual level, you're right (and don't deserve all those downvotes).  Every study I've seen suggests a strong correlation between genetics and intelligence, between intelligence and income, and between income and wealth.  When you multiply them out, the correlation becomes somewhat less, but it still seems like a fair statement to say that genetics is correlated with wealth.<p>That doesn't imply that this correlation indicates a functioning meritocracy, because to the extent that intelligence is genetic, intelligence is not <i>merit</i>.  Merit usually implies that something admirable that someone <i>chose</i> to do, and if someone was born intelligent, how is that merit?  It's like making a value judgment on any other inborn trait - say, that blondes are better than brunettes, or fair-skinned people are better than dark-skinned ones.<p>The part of intelligence that people usually associate with ""merit"" is the part that's <i>not</i> inborn, the part that people have to work for.

1736785,comment,1736055,1736492,0,0,alsomike,,,"Maybe you will find this interesting: graphic designers have lots of rules about the proper use of typography when laying out a document, like correct kerning, use of old-style numerals, ligatures, etc. The reason for following those rules has to do with the same principles of harmony and naturalness in this blog post, but when researchers tested the impact of ""good"" typography vs. ""bad"" typography, they found no differences in performance measures like reading comprehension or reading speed. They did find differences on other measures - in the good typography condition, participants underestimated the amount of time they had spent reading (a measure of engagement with the task) compared to participants in the ""bad typography"" condition.<p>But the most interesting finding was when they tested creative cognition - on that test, the ""good typography"" participants scored much better than the ""bad typography"" participants. This might explain why we designers insist on good typography (and other design principles). Creativity is a big part of our job, and we want to avoid things that might impair the performance of our creative cognition. But for people in other, ""left-brained"" professions, enhancing creativity is less important and engaging people is less important, so it makes sense that they would see design rules as irrelevant extra work of little value.<p>Designers rush to judgment when they see ""bad"" design because it almost literally hurts their brain. But, maybe the person who designed it or the audience for it doesn't have that kind of brain - and that's OK.",1285700032

I do a fair amount of HDR work with a Canon 7D, and the process is anything but simple. The results can be outstanding, but there is a lot of work in getting to the end product. The iPhone is using fairly conservative settings that avoid the surreal effects that HDR can produce if you are not careful.<p>Of course, it probably helps that the phone is able to make intelligent exposure decisions by evaluative metering. It can automatically pick the 3 best exposures. Most cameras do not have such automated capabilities. At best, you can take bracketed shots, but each shot is hard-coded to your chosen EV offset. I would imagine in-camera HDR will be the next must-have feature in point-and-shoots, which, given time, will no doubt find its way into professional models.<p>As far as the pro models go, I would love to have a more automated method of taking a series of raw shots at HDR-optimal EV offsets.",1285699807

I do not want to quote him, and it was definitely an informal conversation, but I will paraphrase some of the very important points that he made about startups in general and the approach they took to gaining users. I have found this information really useful in my own startup and I would love to share with all of you.<p>One thing they focused on was their core users. Listening to them, almost to the point of not being scalable. Going to the houses of the people that were registered and asking them questions like ""What is the hardest part or most undesirable part of using our product?"". That kind of engagement has 2 real benefits: 1. You get real concrete answers about what to fix and 2. It turns your users into excited, advocates for your product. A key point here is scalability. Sometimes it's a good thing to ignore scalable solutions in a startup in order to get things going ( a common mistake I have made on a number of occasions).<p>Another point that he made about their work was providing high quality pictures and content on their website. They spent time going with (rented) wide lens cameras to users house's to take high quality pictures to put up. This aesthetic change can produce a much stronger sense of trust in a service and is something that all founders should think about.<p>Hope that can be helpful to someone :)",1285699508

1736680,comment,1735850,1735850,0,0,zeynel1,,,"Time Likely To End Within Earth's Lifespan, Say Astrologers<p>There is a 50 per cent chance that time will end within the next 3.7 billion years, according to a new astrological model of the zodiac.<p>Look out into space and the signs are plain to see. According to a certain reading of our tarot cards; Cronos created Heaven and Earth when he sneezed for the first time 13 billion years ago; therefore; Heaven and Earth have been expanding ever since. And the best evidence of the expansion of the Cronos' sneeze comes from observation of the Cronos' germs in distance reaches of the cosmos; therefore; cosmos' expansion is accelerating.<p>That has an important but unavoidable consequence: it means that the cosmos will expand forever. And a cosmos that expands forever is infinite and eternal. This is obviously because the creator of the cosmos the eternal and infinite god Cronos is infinite and eternal.<p>Today, a group of astronologist rebel against this idea. They say an infinitely expanding cosmos cannot be so because the laws of astrology do not work in an infinite cosmos. For these laws to make any sense, the cosmos must end, say the Trimagistus Nuovo Raphaello Bousso at the University of California, Berkeley and few pals. And they have divined when that is most likely to happen.<p>Their divination is deceptively simple and surprisingly powerful. Here's how it goes. If the cosmos lasts forever, then any event that can happen, will happen, no matter how unlikely. In fact, this event will happen an infinite number of times.<p>This leads to a problem. When there are an infinite number of instances of every possible divination, it becomes impossible to determine the probabilities of any of these divined events to occur. And when that happens, the laws of astrology simply don't apply; the absurd laws of physics take over. ""This is known as the ""measure problem"" of eternal inflation,"" say Bousso and buddies.<p>In effect, these guys are saying that the laws of astrology abhor an eternal universe.<p>The only way out of this conundrum is to divine some kind of divine intervention that brings an end to the cosmos. Then all the probabilities make sense again and the laws of astrology regain their power to divine.<p>When might this be? Bousso and co have consulted Cronos' assistant in charge of human affairs, a Mr. Prometheus, and this is the reply they got: ""Time is unlikely to end in our lifetime, but there is a 50% chance that time will end within the next 3.7 billion years,"" said Mr. Prometheus who started it all when he stole the light from Gods to give it to humans and that was about 3.7 billion years ago. So if no symmetry breaking occurs; Bousso and Co's 3.7 billion year prediction for the end of time is as good as proved by Einstein's General Relativity.<p>But Mr. Prometheus had one cautionary statement: ""The time will end for humans; not for gods. I am sorry"" said Mr. Prometheus, a good friend of humanity since the beginning.<p>3.7 billion years is not so long! It means that the end of the time is likely to happen within the lifetime of the Gaea and the Hyperion.<p>But Buosso and co have some comforting news too. They don't know what kind of divine intervention will cause the end of time for humanity but they do say that we won't see it coming. They point out that if we were to observe the end of time in any other part of the cosmos where the authority of Cronos has been usurped; we would have to be causally ahead of it, which is unlikely because the God Mnemosyne hates to remember what she had not forgotten.<p>In other words we'll run headlong into this divine intervention before we can observe its effects on anything else.<p>The imminent end of time is a little unsettling but the argument is by no means astronologically sound. Among other things it depends crucially on an important assumption about the laws of astrology: that we ought to be able to understand why they work, not just observe that they do work. And that's a physical point of view rather than an astrological argument. And you cannot trust physicists to explain anything; because for them if it is Wednesday it must be a wave; if it is thursday it must be a particle.<p>So Buosso and buddies raise some interesting questions but nothing to lose any sleep over. At least, not for another 3.7 billion years Cronos will not bother to end time for human beings.<p>Ref: arxiv.org/abs/1009.4698: Eternal Inflation Predicts That Time Will End",1285698239

What we see from the examples of crowd sourcing is a real-life version of a central limit theorem: if you have enough observations in a sample, the sample mean will approach the population mean, if the distribution of the population is normal.  Many natural phenomena are normally distributed, making the bell curve a fantastically useful statistical tool.<p>However, Taleb goes on to note that while the normal distribution is very good with natural phenomena, it often does very poorly with social phenomena.  Many social phenomena are best approximated with power law distributions rather than bell curve distributions.  As such, attempting to model social phenomena with a normal distribution will end up underestimating extreme occurrences or fat tails.  This is Taleb's critique of using standard inferential statistics, based on the normal distribution, to examine social phenomena such as income distributions or financial markets.<p>In the article, we see that the central limit theorem does not hold when the distribution that is being modeled/approximated is too skewed.  (One of the statistical tests for normality measures skewness.)  Things like income and wealth distributions, as social phenomena, have been shown time and again to follow a power law distribution rather than a normal distribution.  Thus it shouldn't be a surprise that averages estimates of the distribution fail to capture the 'fat tail' of the top quintile.",1285698071

1736594,comment,1736055,1736055,0,0,city41,,,"Fine painters will almost never use black. The pigment in black paint is very deadening and harsh, it's difficult to work with. It's much better to take the time and create dark hues from the rest of the color wheel. A standard exercise in color theory classes is to create black from the primary colors. Most people end up with brown, but a beautiful, rich black and nearby shades can be accomplished, and it's worth the effort.<p>It's an entirely different ball game though when you switch from a subtractive color system (which is what painting is, the primaries being cyan, magenta and yellow) to an additive one (which a computer monitor is, with the primaries being the well known RGB). In an additive system dark hues are only accomplished by removing light instead of adding pigment, so the problems a painter faces with black don't exist quite in the same way. So comparing website/app design to Monet is a tiny bit far fetched.<p>It seemed like a lifetime ago but I used to live and breath this stuff, even got a degree in painting. I guess it wasn't entirely useless :)",1285696874

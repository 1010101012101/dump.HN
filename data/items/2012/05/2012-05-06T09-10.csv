3934685,comment,3933121,3933365,5,0,heyitsnick,,,"I'm confused here. Posting ""LOL!"" is not spam in any way, at least how i define spam. It might not subjectively be appropriate (if it's not appropriate to find it funny), it's debateably irrelevant (if it is not important who finds it funny). But it's not spam.<p>Spam is broadly defined as unsolicited bulk advertising. An example spam comment would be ""LOL! Also check out this great pharmaceutical company: xxx"".<p>The latter is certainly something that should be filtered out, if it's irrelevant advertising that marketers are using to peddle their crap. It's mostly unsubjective and uncontextual and its appropriate for filters to automatically detect.<p>But filtering out the former is a form of censorship that is often best left to humans (like downvotes to bury bad comments). I don't think this should be the job of the comments system to determine what is considered ""appropriate"" or ""beneficial to the discussion.""<p>A ""LOL"" or ASCII art image or ""no u"" or any other meme can be anything from a well-timed ironic offhand jab, an appropriate affirmation or response, to totally irrelevant and inappropriate noise. It depends on topic, context, parent, and existing noise in the thread and is inherently objective.",1336298079

3934683,comment,3934222,3934222,1,0,zaptheimpaler,,,"Personally, I liked it because of the refreshing UI. I think a lot of blogs are very hard to navigate (especially when the blog posts are listed by month on the side, or have previous/next buttons, but theres no easy way to just view a complete list at once or search through posts), this wasn't. The idea of multiple pages in a single blog post was awesome! I didn't try creating a blog myself, but if you can make it as easy to create blogs as it is on other sites while providing the UI/multiple pages, I think you have an advantage.<p>That said, it's also a very easy idea to replicate. Perhaps you need to identify the people who would be willing to use this a little better and offer a few more advanced features targeted towards them. I see this product as filling a nice somewhere between a full-blown CMS like Joomla and a simple blogging engine, and understanding what the users of that niche want will help.",1336298044

This is what most people answer about DDG. I think this is wrong. Google and Yahoo!, while funny names, sound ""cool"". DuckDuckGo doesn't. My memory isn't great, so I can't be sure I'm right about this, but I'm pretty sure that the first time I heard ""Google"" or ""Yahoo!"", I had a much better reaction than the first (and every) time I hear ""DuckDuckGo"".<p>I also think it's not smart to cling to the ""people will get used to it, Google was the same"" defense. If it's true, sure. I think it's not, and it's just misleading and true-sounding enough that DuckDuckGo keeps going.<p>2. The domain name itself is a problem (long, annoying to type, etc.), and once they get ddg it will be better.<p>I agree on this point, although I do think the name is still an important point, not just for the domain. It's a brand.<p>I'd like to reiterate that I'm not saying this things to be a critic, or just to be mean. I really value the work of DuckDuckGo, I think it's great that there's good competition to Google, and I'm a fan of Gabriel Weinberg. I'm only saying this because it's an issue that keeps coming up, and I really think it has a bad effect on DuckDuckGo.",1336297872

How long ago were those 2 years - a couple years ago, or more than a decade?<p>Most universities like to talk about the rule-of-thumb of 2 hours study per hour of instruction. Full course loads are 12-18 hours of instruction per week in this part of the world, so the university would like you to spend 24-36 hours per week studying.

We'll see how long it lasts as a business category.<p>As others have pointed out, labels are far more than a middleman. To market music as a product requires just as much business infrastructure as any other modern media. Which is to say a lot!<p>In addition, a major label will front the money for the project, with budgets in the hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Since most of their acts come nowhere near recouping, the contracts are structured aggressively in the label's favor. They hope to cover all the production and marketing costs of all their acts from the few that make money (hits).<p>One problem for both fans and musicians is discovery. It's trivial to make your music available to anyone in the world, whereas it used to take a huge capital investment to get product distributed. On the other hand, the marketing and production costs haven't significantly changed. Getting a significant amount of people to discover and like your music is a daunting project for any entity, large or small. On occasion a viral hit breaks through, but the acts that represent the bulk of economic activity are actively created and pushed by pros.<p>Spotify is providing the most promising alternative distribution system I've seen yet.

It's not just a text editor with file transfer (FTP, Dropbox, etc.). I'm doing an IDE for the iPad. With GitHub support (and soon, Heroku deployment).<p>At the moment, iPad is not very good as a development environment, since Apple doesn't allow you to compile / run code on the iPad directly. You need backend support (e.g. cloud) that allows you to edit / compile / run code on the iPad.<p>But an iPad with multi touch interface and a bluetooth keyboard opens up a lot of interesting possibilities as an IDE. For example, the multi touch interface allows you to choose colour graphically (see <a href=""http://twolivesleft.com/Codea/Screen-Colors.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twolivesleft.com/Codea/Screen-Colors.png</a> ). Rather than experimenting with different values of RGB, you can just tap it.<p>I'm still building Worqshop. Thus, I'm not using the iPad as a development tool. I still need Xcode and my Mac :)
At the moment, I'm using Worqshop to edit some HTML/CSS on GitHub, building HTML5 apps with Worqshop + GitHub + StackMob..
And soon, with Heroku deployment support, I can write Ruby / Python apps on my iPad and deploy it to Heroku.<p>Footnote 1: I still think the bluetooth keyboard is necessary for fast typing. I can't type very fast with the on screen keyboard<p>Footnote 2: I still prefer to code using text rather than using graphical items (i.e <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language</a> ). Simply because text is a very compact representation of the semantics of code. As an example, to represent the semantic of ""if / then / else"" you only need a few lines of code.

They didn't see it this way, but they bought into the Apple ecosystem.<p>For many people, longer they live in the Apple ecosystem, the more difficult it is to leave - your non-Apple device looks different, feels different, acts different[1], and won't dock in music players or anything else, and needs a different charging/data cable. It's an eyesore like having a yellow door on your black car. For the large fraction of the population that values image, this is unacceptable, and Windows is equivalent OSX for most computing needs. The iPod served to funnel this group into this ecosystem.<p>After they had acquired most of the users who would willingly switch, Apple removed the lock-in to allow more users to purchase their device. This allowed both device and software (app+MP3) sales to continue to people less willing to switch from Windows.<p>In effect, it's also time-delayed way of creating different price points - early adopters had to pay extra to purchase a Mac, but later adopters saved that money.<p>[1]Unless it's a Samsung Galaxy Nexus?",1336296098

Then actively trying to kill it.

They were saying to big corporations, that your choice wasn't Microsoft versus the internet, Microsoft WAS the internet. Only better.<p>C# and the CLR were there to counter Java and the JVM.<p>Their concept of Web Services was to make web technologies a mere transport layer for an RPC protocol called SOAP, which you would build with Microsoft IDEs.<p>Hailstorm and Passport were an attempt to make Microsoft the centralized broker for all sensitive information on the internet.

Platforms that <i>start</i> really complex don't have a hope of lasting -- they collapse before they get to the stage of old and hairy.<p>I think this is an important point -- systems that last have to start really simple.<p>The Web was laughably simple at first.  HTTP 1.0 was roughly: open a TCP connection, send a URL, get the document back, close the connection.  It was WAY simpler than many contemporary hypertext solutions.<p>Unix was also WAY simpler than its contemporaries.  Linux is old and hairy now, but that's just how things age without falling apart.  They have to accomodate many different people's (sometimes broken) mental models under one roof.  A system like Opa seems like it can only accomodate the mental model of its creators, and thus won't age gracefully.<p>C++ despite being huge has some modesty: it respected people's existing C code and didn't ""cover it up"".  Plenty of people write C with classes still and that's actually a feature.  Opa seems like it ""covers up"" what's underneath.<p>Java is kind of an exception to the adoption curve because it had huge marketing behind it like no other language did.  But I think Java 1.0 was still pretty darn simple.  It was a very small language.  I'll grant that Java did try to cover up the OS.  I think this limited its widespread application, but it's admittedly still massively popular for certain things.  You couldn't do async I/O in Java for awhile, nor could you do things like make a Windows shortcut on the desktop.<p>Hadoop, being based on the MapReduce abstraction, does indeed pretty successfully allow the programmer to ignore the network.  The fairly large restriction of being able to write 2 pure functions -- map and reduce -- is what allows this (it allows retries without affecting correctness, etc.).  In a way this proves the point.  You can't write arbitrary procedural/stateful code (in Opa or any other language) and distribute it over the network at scale.  I'll go as far as to claim that this problem is unsolvable in a fundamental sense, like the halting problem is unsolvable.<p>Now maybe Opa introduces some restrictions in their model that help with distribution that I don't know about, but in general I am skeptical of the ""write all your code in this one clean language with our nice model and we'll figure out the rest automatically with our hyper-optimized advanced technology"".  We've heard it before.<p>I honestly don't know why as a programmer you would want to ignore the distinction of code running on the client or the server.  I'm all for sharing (some) code, as Node.js allows, but it should be obvious in any application whether a code path is running on the client or the server, and you shouldn't need a compiler to figure it out.

Further, the library serves to wrap the API in the idioms appropriate for the language.

I don't try to bring along liquids and wear shoes that are easily removed) and haven't had to wait in a security line longer than 15 minutes in the US in 6+ years.<p>I have been pulled aside twice to be patted down by the TSA, neither of which invasive nor did they get near my genitals. In contrast I have also been patted down by airport security in Belgium (much more invasive, didn't touch crotch) and been frisked twice by police in the USA (very invasive, definitely did touch crotch). [I have no knowledge of the female experience of being frisked - unfortunately I suspect a much higher level of both discomfort and inappropriate groping]<p>I don't like that our security is based stupid rules instead of smart security analysis, but the level of vitriol I see in the internet is totally disproportionate to my experience. The worst part of flying for me is getting stuck in the security line behind some person who still doesn't know full bottles of water aren't allowed through security and then try to argue with the TSA agents in an attempt to save $4 - and given that I still get through the line often under 10 minutes, that is more of pet peeve than a real issue worth complaining about.",1353445165

I put a phone number a huge one on my website and started answering and listening to my customers.  It has been life changing, we know what our customers like, we know what they don't like.   We're excited to hear and help them in realtime.   Our customers love that we answer the phone.   We also do email and live chat, but for many the phone is great.   I used to suck at the phone and definitely I still have my moments.   In general, I've learned how to end the bad calls quickly - or correctly in that a bad call can be your best call.  When you can help a customer stay a customer, you can really do this best over the phone.

Dogster.com still has the kind of usage that isn't the home run Paul is looking for in his investments, but it is sustainable.<p>The 3rd point about not-noticing has two excpetions: Hegel and PayPal. Let's stick to the second. Elon Musk noticed it from the very start as a competitor running what was then also a payment system known as X.com. I think when he added his startup DNA into the mix, although it led to an employee revolt and his ouster, it made PayPal stronger.

While I am not a firm believer in the efficient market hypothesis, I think it is very close.

In fact in many areas rollers can't be used at all because of the terrain and vegetation, so demining teams use a combination of other techniques.<p>This concept is actually worse than useless because of the debris it scatters across a minefield and the false confidence it provides.

4811227,comment,4806852,4808111,1,0,javajosh,,,"So movies are a pretty big business. Not as big as people usually think, compared to energy, food, defense. But pretty big. Culturally, people go to the movies as a form of escapism, because story-telling seems to be a deeply ingrained human need (I don't think there is a single culture we know about that doesn't tell stories). Some of these stories are quite inspirational: they inspire thought, debate, criticism, self-reflection, etc. And some of us, the ones that are inclined to, write reviews. I've written one or two myself. Occasionally conversations get started around movies with friends - arguments about the meaning of Being John Malkovich or why they only made one Highlander movie....<p>Listening to stories (or watching them, as the case may be) is a usually enjoyable experience - which is why we choose to listen and even pay for the opportunity to listen to a really good story from a really good storyteller. All of the ""pain points"" around this process have been thoroughly addressed: it's easy to discover movies, buy tickets, download to your computer, get reviews, write reviews. Even the watching experience itself has been improved with 3D (although this is open to debate) and better sound, even things like IMAX and more experimental experiences e.g. Star Tours at Disneyland. There are some places in the world where they even serve food and drink during the movie (or at least during an intermission).<p>The biggest pain people feel about movies is dealing with the proliferation of choice. It doesn't seem to me that there is an underserved market of people who would see more movies if only they knew about the good ones.<p>Imagine, if you will, your own personal Heaven. Presumably storytelling and movies are still happening. What is the heavenly, perfect movie-going experience? Does the movie take over your visual cortex? Are movies recommended by God - or indeed, created by Him to perfectly stimulate your mind in the way He knows you like? Does your reaction telepathically propagate to everyone else in Heaven? (Is telepathic propagation connectionless? I suppose that's another thread).",1353444243

They are precision milled out of the aluminum stamp body, and, thus, they are still VERY hard to spoof because the location of the observed dots needs to be precise down to the pixel resolution of the phone. You can't spoof them with you fingers.  The nice thing about these stamps is that they are nothing more than a solid block of aluminum - no circuitry whatsoever. You can run them through a dishwasher or an autoclave - great for food service and medical applications.<p>We also have more secure ""dynamic"" stamps wherein the capacitive  touch points are modulated in sequence amongst an array of potential contact points.  These are still in the prototype stage, but we get a lot of requests for them, so may be looking to launch this new product line in the spring.<p>Finally, as for use cases - we can do many of the things people are currently trying to use NFC, QR Codes and/or GPS gating to authenticate.

Some Americans propose laws even more severe than Japan's.[124] Often, the suggestion comes as an offhand remark in an newspaper editorial, but even when the suggestion is advanced by scholars, the reasoning is often superficial and unpersuasive.<p>L Craig Parker, an American expert on the Japanese police, proposes that the United States adopt Japanese gun control and also other Japanese strategies, such as a National Police Agency. Parker's brief discussion of guns, however, simply recites statistics showing that Japan has less guns and less gun crime. His only evidence that gun control would actually reduce crime in America is a study by Dr Leonard Berkowitz arguing that guns cause aggression. Actually, what the studies by Berkowitz and others showed was that people acted more aggressively towards other people if the other person was associated with weapons; for example, motorists reacted more aggressively to other vehicles slow to accelerate when a red light turned green if the slow car had a rude bumper sticker and a rifle in a gun rack.[125]<p>Summing up the perspective of many gun prohibitionists, one Japanese newspaper reporter writes, 'It strikes me as clear that there is a distinct correlation between gun control laws and the rate of violent crime. The fewer the guns, the less the violence'.[126] But the claim that fewer guns correlates with less violence is plainly wrong. America experienced falling crime and homicide rates in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1980s, all periods during which per capita gun (p.40)ownership, especially handgun ownership, rose.[127] And Japan, with its severe gun control, suffers no less murder than Switzerland, one of the most gun-intensive societies on earth.[128]<p>Japan's gun control does play an important role in the low Japanese crime rate, but not because of some simple relation between gun density and crime. Japan's gun control is one inseparable part of a vast mosaic of social control. Gun control underscores the pervasive cultural theme that the individual is subordinate to society and to the Government. The same theme is reflected in the absence of protection against Government searches and prosecutions. The police are the most powerful on earth, partly because of the lack of legal constraints and particularly because of their social authority.""<p>I found that article from this:<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-l...</a>",1353443502

It's equipped with six gas chromatography (GC) columns. The output of these columns can be fed into either a mass detector (QMS) or spectrometer (TLS). IMO, none of these tools can detect life itself:<p><a href=""http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/sam/samiam.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/sam/samiam.html</a><p>SAM's purpose is specifically to find evidence for organic molecules - molecules based on carbon.

I'm pretty sure that's the only discovery that would be 'earthshaking' for the public.<p>What would be earthshaking for me as an organic chemist?<p>One possibility would be that SAM has discovered known byproducts of life, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as was found in the Martian Meteorite studied by the Zare group:<p><a href=""http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/97/4.3.97/Mars_rock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/97/4.3.97/Mars_rock.ht...</a><p>PAHs can be made through a variety of inanimate processes, so I'd view this discovery as more ho-hum.<p>Still, it should be remembered that Viking failed to detect the presence of any organic molecules at all. Finding any organic molecules would be a big change in how we view Mars - but not in my view 'one for the history books'.<p>However, if familiar building blocks of life such as amino acids or carbohydrates were detected, that would indeed fall into the earthshaking category.<p>Life on Earth uses a selection of about 20 different amino acids. I would consider observation of a similar assortment of amino acids as strong evidence pointing to past or present life on Mars.<p>Observation of five- and six-carbon carbohydrates, which are generally much more difficult to synthesize than amino acids, would be even stronger evidence for life. It's hard to overestimate how important that discovery would be.<p>Observation of peptides - amino acids strung together as is done by all known life would probably be the most mind-blowing thing I could imagine SAM discovering. Depending on what specifically was found, it could remove any doubt - Mars has or had life. Very long peptide chains can be synthesized without life, but it's not easy. The exact composition of amino acids in the peptide chain would be critical for the interpretation and would be more time consuming than just, for example, observing a PAH.<p>The fact that amino acids, peptides, or carbohydrates themselves were detectable today, given that they do degrade over time, could point in the direction of life having been present recently.",1353443245

4811082,comment,4809320,4810576,4,0,saurik,,,"> If you're paying more than $30/mo at home for land based Internet, you feel like you're being ripped off.<p>Please speak for yourself: I pay much more than this, by choice (to get higher bandwidth caps). (For the record, I also ""put my money where my mouth is"", and immediately called AT&T when they started phasing out of unlimited data plans and opted myself out of that plan to the limited one. This has meant that on some months I pay much more than I used to, but it has also meant that on many months I pay less; it also means that I no longer am contributing to a systemic bias against disruptive-ish services like FaceTime or Netflix.)<p>> Compare it to Cable Internet. You are capable of receiving impressive speeds during low use time and your experience will suffer during high use time. Same with cell phone data.<p>This only argues for peak vs. off-peak pricing being different. In fact, I specifically cover this in my talk with an analogy to how electricity is billed. It simply makes obvious sense that if, in the middle of the night, bandwidth is nearly free due to unused infrastructure, yet during the day it is a spare commodity, that bandwidth should be priced differently during the night than it is during the day. Hell, even our cellular telephone service is billed in this way: it just makes sense.<p>> And you take into account that an average home user will use much, MUCH more data than what cell phone companies are charging their $30 on.<p>You seem to believe (not just with this sentence, but with most of your argument) that data should cost the same whether it comes over a wire or via a cellular connection: the costs simply aren't the same for numerous reasons ranging across the board from the technical to the political. (This includes some less-obvious ones, such as how no one wants a cell tower in their neighborhood, yet everyone wants good cell service: I discuss this particular issue in my talk along with some humorous slides.)<p>> We're not talking about what the probability of what a customer would or COULD use, we're talking about actual amounts.<p>No, actually: we have to talk about the probability of what a customer would use, as to do anything else is to price yourself out of the market. Again, I go into detail on this in my talk, using an analogy involving salt, but in this case, if AT&T charged for the actual bandwidth on the label it would be trivial for competitors like Verizon to undercut them by just noticing ""hey, our average usage is for half of what we are charging, so there's a ton of overhead in our margin we can give back to the customer"". Carriers, like most other almost entirely fungible commodity (they really are a ""dumb pipe"" with only minor differences in quality or locality), are in fierce pricing competition.<p>> Why? Maybe you could compare it to satellite based Internet. Satellite has fixed bandwidths and astronomically expensive equipment and that's all it does it provide Internet service. But, why would you compare it to satellite based? All a cell carrier does is get it back to a tower a maximum of 5 miles away. There they pay for land based Internet pipes.<p>Again, you seem to be entirely discounting the cost of those towers, both in terms of infrastructure and equipment and in terms of land; you also seem to be discounting the concern of limited frequency space, and the fierce competitions that occur to obtain it from the auction system we have for selling it off. If you want really cheap bandwidth, get a land-line: as you say, they exist.<p>And yes: even satellite internet may be cheaper in many circumstances; if nothing else, you have to take into consideration that most of the carrier plans people look at and compare are smart-phone subsidy contracts, which means that you are paying much <i>much</i> more than if you were willing to accept that, in fact, that iPhone or Android device in your pocket should have cost $500-$600. For some stupid reason, people get sticker shock at a large investment in hardware, but are willing to just whine about service costs.<p>> So, I simply ask, if you support a pay as you go model for cell phone providers, what price per MB do you have in mind? Because right now, it highway-frickin'-robery and they're still whining about data usage.<p>This question doesn't really matter; in essence, you are asking it because you feel that the carriers are drastically overcharging for a service that you somehow believe you can get from your cable provider, and thereby are certain that in a per-kB world the price will somehow be even more ludicrously expensive.<p>My contention is that the core issue here isn't price: it is poor incentives; the carriers are incentivized right now to hate data, as they are billing for it in an incorrect unit, leading to all kinds of weird pressures in seemingly-unrelated parts of the ecosystem, such as the old rule the iTunes App Store used to have on applications that used ""too much"" bandwidth (this was thankfully dismantled when AT&T stopped offering ""unlimited"" bandwidth pricing): you simply wouldn't have those horrible incentives under per-kB pricing.<p>Meanwhile, I am fairly certain that, based on the rather poor profit margins I see when I look at the financial statements released by carriers, combined with how fierce they seem to be to jump onto pricing models that aren't even sustainable in the long term yet give them temporary advantages over their competitors, that whatever the price that ends up coming out of this will be mostly fair. More expensive than cable? Well, duh. But, more expensive than now? Only if the customers suck and change their behaviors because of it; otherwise, when you have better pricing models things actually tend to get cheaper for normal people (as they did for 95% of customers when AT&T stopped running their unlimited data pricing plan).",1353442348

Department of Homeland Security"":<p>""""""As other circuits have held, and as the Supreme Court has strongly suggested, screening passengers at an airport is an ""administrative search"" because the primary goal is not to determine whether any passenger has committed a crime but rather to protect the public from a terrorist attack. See United States v. Aukai, 497 F.3d 955, 95863 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (passenger search at airport checkpoint); United States v. Hartwell, 436 F.3d 174, 17881 (3d Cir. 2006) (Alito, J.) (same); United States v. Edwards, 498 F.2d 496, 499501 (2d Cir. 1974) (Friendly, J.) (carry-on baggage search at airport); see also Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U.S. 419 (2004) (police set up checkpoint to obtain information about earlier crash); Mich. Dept of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990) (sobriety checkpoint). An administrative search does not require individualized suspicion. City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 41, 4748 (2000) (individualized suspicion required when police checkpoint is primarily [for] general crime control, that is, to detect evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing unlike searches at places like airports ... where the need for such measures to ensure public safety can be particularly acute). Instead, whether an administrative search is unreasonable within the condemnation of the Fourth Amendment is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individuals privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests. United States v. Knights, 534 U.S. 112, 118-19 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).""""""<p>The Edwards reference you mentioned is in there, but so are others. In ""United States v. Aukai"" (2007) the 9th Circuit said ""We have held that airport screening searches, like the one at issue here, are constitutionally reasonable administrative searches because they are ""conducted as part of a general regulatory scheme in furtherance of an administrative purpose, namely, to prevent the carrying of weapons or explosives aboard aircraft, and thereby to prevent hijackings.""<p>In United States v. Hartwell (3d Cir. 2006), para. 8 ""We hold that the search was permissible under the administrative search doctrine. Cf. United States v. Marquez, 410 F.3d 612, 616 (9th Cir.2005) (""Airport screenings of passengers and their baggage constitute administrative searches and are subject to the limitations of the Fourth Amendment."").<p>These were all easy to find.",1353442255

I speculate the charge manager is unable to sense that the battery is in fact draining slowly (as the phone is using more power than the attempted trickle charge is supplying), leading to a deep discharge (kills battery life) followed by unexpected shutdown.

The sample analysis instrument is a gas chromatograph connected to a laser spectrometer and a mass spectrometer. What happens is that a sample will be vaporized and then pushed through a long column. The column is designed so that different molecules will have a different speed through the column and thus will come out at different times. Then each of those parts of the sample (which should be comprised primarily of one molecule) is passed into the spectrometers, which can identify its molecular structure.

Then I read at the above link that they've drawn up some clever heuristics to guess the 'right' scroll amount in each case.<p>""It works well on many pages. No doubt there are some pages it doesn't work on. It seems like a good idea to start conservatively here.""<p>I cautiously welcome this 'fix' for my own casual web browsing, while fearing for the rare trouble it might cause a responsible web dev who might have a legitimate need for a particular kind of overlay while having page up/down still work in the currently established way. No such need springs to mind but I'm sure that if I thought about it for long enough, in this age of games in the browser and whatnot... (some sort of fancy web comic perhaps?). Now needing to workaround what is more complex and unpredictable behaviour, this is the kind of push/pull between web developers and browser implementers which a few years down the line could turn into a bloody impossible mess for all concerned.",1353441733

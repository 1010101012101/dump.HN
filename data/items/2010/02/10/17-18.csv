1115505,comment,1114740,1115082,0,0,dantheman,,,"I agree it's keeping the economy poorer, but is it harming the world economy?  People are getting goods at lower prices, that frees up more money for investment.  So I'd say if anything it's improving the world economy.   Once again, I feel the only objection is that it is unfair to chinese citizens because the are essentially being stolen from.  As for you comment on 2nd order effects,  I think that is incorrect -- China only competes on labor costs, they don't sell goods for less than the material costs.  Now if you're saying that they can use less efficient (more wasteful) processes since the difference is made up in labor, I'll agree -- but I think they'll adopt the more efficient processes to increase their bottom line eventually.",1265824747

1115499,comment,1114122,1114318,0,0,prole,,,"Quite the opposite. The journalist idea of ""Anonymous"" is very different from the insider idea of Anonymous. In the simplest terms, Anonymous is anyone, really. It's not limited to 4chan users (there are other <i>chans, and the users sometimes overlap). 4chan itself is just a convenient place to recruit people to perform an attack and later use as a scapegoat.<p>As an example, the anti-Scientology protests were reported under the catch-all banner of Anonymous, but the people organizing it and hitting the streets were also from rival forums such as Something Awful. Funny enough, the protest movement is completely different from (and at odds with) the original catalyst: other Anons DDoSing Scientology websites for using the DMCA to take down a video on YouTube. As someone mentioned earlier in the comments, one core motivation is trolling, or ""lulz,"" so under this so-large-its-useless umbrella term ""Anonymous,"" there are groups sabotaging one another just because it's funny.<p>The core people </i>organizing* these DDoS attacks come and go, but they are a dedicated few who have the time and skills to design such programs to distribute to the masses. As in the Time magazine hack, it was respectably sophisticated (this article does it justice: <a href=""http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/15/inside-the-precision-hack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/15/inside-the-precision-ha...</a>). And yes, this core group does have botnets, as well as excellent social engineering skills to motivate *channers to download and execute their software.<p>I love watching people and organizations of all varieties underestimate just how tenaciously annoying they can be.",1265824664
1115498,comment,1115106,1115394,0,0,mdasen,,,"First, Ford didn't take any government money and actually reported a profit for the past year.<p>Second, there's a difference between a subsidy and loans.  GM and Chrysler got loans.  Now, they were loans they couldn't have gotten on the open market because they looked too toxic.  However, GM is now saying they'll be able to repay the loan pretty quickly.  That indicates that investors misjudged the risk.  Granted, it could have turned out otherwise (and I was one of the people that thought that it would have).<p>And I think that people feel betrayed if a company has a potentially fatal flaw in their devices.  This isn't an issue of mere reliability.  If my car is unreliable, it's annoying and I have higher repair bills.  If my car speeds up to 100MPH and I can't stop it, I can die.  Those two things sit differently with consumers.  And it looks like Toyota tried to write it off as nothing when it was something and tried to protect their image rather than their customers lives.<p>It's one of those things: if a company has produced a wonderful, superior, reliable vehicle that kills 1 in 100,000, are they better?  Most would say no, but it's easier to hide and it looks like Toyota was trying to hide their problems.<p>Toyota isn't failed, but this will be a huge setback for them (and it should be).  If you hide problems that are fatal to people, you deserve to have your sales drop.  There's an outrage over that.<p>Toyota screwed up big time for many years.  The US auto makers also screwed up for many years.  The US auto makers troubles came to light slowly in a way that was mostly about finances, wages, etc.  Toyota's screw up is about human fatalities and came to light very quickly.  That's a lot of the difference in the way it's being treated by the media.",1265824637

1115496,comment,1115325,1115325,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Seems like a stretch to me. I read the patent and in particular the claims they are saying the Chicago Tribune infringed on. I then looked at the Tribune's website and don't see where they would be infringing based on the claims and description in the patent. Looking at the Jump Code website, it gives an example of newspaper classified ads, but in looking at the Tribune website I don't any ""codes"" in their classifieds. In fact most of their classifieds are run by third-party systems (CareerBuilder, Pets.com, etc...). I wonder if the print version of the Tribune includes some reference to these numbers in their classifieds or even articles in the paper relating the print article to the online version.<p>I don't think this is a unique idea though and I would think it would be easy to find some form of prior art in the case. The system basically sounds like using a ""keyword"", or in this case a JumpCode, to link to a website. But the patent was filed in 2000. Companies like AOL and even CompuServe have used keywords for years on their site to link to webpages. I know newspapers have used keywords in print classifieds to link to online resources for a while (not sure if it would be before 2000 though) as well.<p>I don't believe these people are trolling necessarily, but I do think they have some aggressive legal advice here and may be looking to get some attention or prevent their business from failing.",1265824616

I'll talk about MOSFETs, Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors.  The word semiconductor is important because it means that a MOSFET can be told to conduct or not, which means it can be used to open and close circuits.  This is the heart of digital computing.<p>There are two kinds, created by putting different kinds of gas (doping) on to silicon.  N and P type.  Each transistor has 3 important points, the source, drain and gate.  If you apply a ""1"" to the gate, the transistor will either open or close, based on whether it is N or P, and allow a signal to move between the source and the gate.  You can pair these N and P type transistors to make CMOS or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor circuits.<p>If you're really interested, I imagine there should be some good tutorials on how to make a simple microprocessor using a hardware description language like Verilog.",1265822558

Getting the pole rights alone to build infrastructure is going to take them years. In some area's within the span of a mile you might pass poles owned by half a dozen different entities. Most of them owned by incumbent Internet service providers who will tell you the pole is already at capacity and if you want to put up your fiber they need to replace 50 poles to cover one new street of infrastructure build out. In many places they'll have to dig trenches for new construction. In cold areas that means you lose at least 5 months a year of actual work time or you spend a fortune digging into the frozen ground. They're going to need to hire a small army of contractors to build plant and splice fiber or make the investment in man power, bucket trucks, gear, etc to do it in house. They're going to need warehouses and office space all over the country. And of course they'll need customer & technical support staff. I'd be shocked if Google makes any real progress on this outside of extremely limited deployments.

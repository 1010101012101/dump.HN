The ARM Mali T658 GPU promises PS3 quality... and there are better chips (Tegra 4, Adreno, etc.) on the way. The Atrix leverages the HDMI+microusb because of the way it designed them to fit into the slots into its dock.<p>Theoretically, you could use the Adreno dock with other phones, but they dont have the ports placed in the same way (to lock into the dock).<p>I think with Google's philosophy of open-ness, it is too much to expect the creation of a new dock standard. I'm not sure if HDMI (or the displayport equivalents) can carry serialized mouse signals in addition to display... but somehow the ports need to be standardized before we have a hope of leveraging hardware that will be equipped to play Crysis by 2012.<p>And that will be a shame - all that power and unable to use it.

(Edit: I could go on for several pages to point out the books flaws, but this podcast does a good job of it.)<p>Do you really think people dislike the book because it was honest? Most of the criticism you see here is because the book never went much deeper than stating facts (and sometimes the wrong facts). This applies to more than just products.<p>Two non-product examples: We never get any good analysis on how Zen Buddhism affected him apart from his college days. When confronted with how cruel he can be, Steve Jobs just says ""that's who I am"". No deeper analysis here either (although Ive does try to give an explanation, Jobs isn't asked about that theory).",1321701578

It was a crash-course in the value of rapid-prototyping, but also in that particular case introduced me to new ways of thinking: Houdini presents a completely different view of geometry and image processing, which is thoroughly non-intuitive to the typical comp-sci graduate. Houdini taught me an (almost literally) orthogonal way of thinking about computer graphics problems.<p>The lessons are more general:
- rapid prototyping is not necessarily coding
- sometimes the non-technical, 'designer' approach is the more efficient one (not necessarily in this case - there is plenty of merit in both approaches)
- the more tools you learn, the more leverage you have - why not learn some of those design tools and learn a different way of thinking about things.<p>(This comment is inspired-by, not directed-at, the two dice portrait posts.)",1321701030

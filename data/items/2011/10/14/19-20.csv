In the end, everything has a cost, ""there is no free lunch"", yadda yadda.<p>Regardless, point taken that as a user who only cares about that one specific feature (which I admit my arguments skewed towards), it might be the situation where a large company burning money into a pit for six years may actually cause more money to be thrown at a small problem over the lifetime of that problem than a sustainable market, and therefore we might be glad in some twisted way about that. ;P<p>I still feel, however, that from a market-level, projects like this are bad for everyone, in the same extrinsic way that we look at people using seemingly cheap materials like styrofoam and partially-hydrogenated oils to build empires that eventually have seriously bad costs; put simply, I look at Google and VC-backed startups in the same way people look at companies polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming.

3112559,comment,3111169,3111169,36,0,zach,,,"When I worked at Sega in the console era, I found out that every console game was open to inspection by other developers in this way.  Because they were all in assembly, if you were ever curious about how a character moved or how a graphics trick was done, well, you would just find out.<p>After all, our development consoles (which the PC debugger connected to) worked just as well on a cartridge from the store as on the code we uploaded to it.  So if you were impressed by an effect in a game like Ranger-X, you just plugged it in and explored it in the debugger for a while.  You'd end up with a new technique and (quite possibly) a snippet of code you could try out on your project.  Happened all the time.<p>Now, I don't think anyone really undertook an effort such as this to lovingly decompile a game with comments on this level, but there were decompilers too.  I was always suspicious that our studio's highly sophisticated platformer engine was based on lots of, uh, best practices.  If you know what I mean.  But that wasn't a big deal.<p>It's interesting because when I later heard about the tech behind the Halo engine, I realized I'd never seen their architecture before  because things had moved on and gentlemen of game development didn't decompile each other's games.  They licensed their engines instead.  If this had been the cartridge age, lots of people would have totally lifted their approach.<p>By the way, the talk I heard, a detailed overview of how the Halo 2 engine works, is available at the page below.  Yeah, it's from seven years ago but it was a ten-year-old engine already.  Good code design lasts.  If you like game guts, this page is a little-known treasure.<p><a href=""http://www.game-tech.com/Talks/Talks.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.game-tech.com/Talks/Talks.htm</a>",1318620166

Having a company that starts today in this space, while they will have an easier time (due to advances) starting and getting up quickly, is drastically different than a company that started six years ago, and might have a large index, advanced algorithms, etc. at this point.<p>2) I don't think Google even tries to make things sustainable. During all of these ""Google shuts down X"" that have been happened recently, some posts here by ex-Google people indicated that Google internally didn't even have reporting on per-project costs... hopefully now that they see how much certain things cost they will cause less market-level problems going forward.<p>(edit: I forgot to add this point) I mean, seriously: Google, a company that makes all of its money on advertisements, and for whom ads permeate everything, doesn't have ads on Google Code Search, and AFAIR never did. If you do absolutely nothing else for such a service, as Google, you'd put some ads on it; even Gmail has ads, and that's a place where people find them creepy.<p>I therefore simply cannot believe that they actually are looking at this project as something that is worth their time to make sustainable: they are a giant company with a thousand things to do; this was cool one day, maybe useful to some engineers internally, and they kind of just did it, and dumped the result on the ecosystem, where it created a little vortex-of-free-and-good that eventually has collapsed into a singularity, and will be gone in the next couple months, leaving us with the ""vacuum"" that you mention.<p>Meanwhile, it might simply be because even if it was successful, the userbase would be tiny, and the revenue generated would be ""not enough to justify the lack of focus"" (Google is getting behind the whole ""more wood, fewer arrows"" thing lately); whereas, to a small company, it might have enough margins to sustain a few people, which is ""enough to bother with"" at that level.<p>~3) The point here isn't that people who care about sustainability should be using Pinboard.in instead of del.icio.us (although they should, and those that didn't got burned at the last minute): it is that society is worse off because there are people in the ecosystem who are operating unsustainably.",1318620139

However, these aren't entirely ""urban poor"" people either. The movement to these poor slums also has a large degree of private innovation and some leap-frogging that brings millions of these new urban dwellers into a ""pseudo-middle-class"".

Only a few platforms can hold developer attention and if you're a 10% player in 2015, the developers might not care enough to make a version of an app for you. If the ecosystem is not there, the users aren't, too. The desktop market exploded in the 90s, but where were the incumbents in the mid 80s like Amiga?<p>This lead to Palm/HP's exit from the mobile business inspite of having a nice product, the lack of ecosystem is quite damaging. This is the reason RIM is in trouble too. MS has a better shot with their developer tools, developer relations and perseverance(see XBox).  Not to mention Android licensing fees and the Windows/Office/Server cashcows. They were able to get developers to write ~30,000 apps in less than a year for a nascent platform with zero users one year ago.<p>Nokia wasn't going anywhere with Symbian, wanted to get Meego going, but it wasn't ready fast enough on enough phones and wasn't confident on seeding yet another new ecosystem, so they took the drastic decision of ditching it and aligning with the WP ecosystem.<p>RIM is a one trick pony with nowhere to go, and the attempt to come out of the decline with the Playbook seems to have gone badly wrong.

(The tragedy is that, if you read the review, it's clearly positivethe reviewer evidently thought that 1-star was best. D'oh!) In addition, any sensible ranking should take into account statistical significance, so that (say) a 4.6 ranking consisting of 45 reviews (possibly) gets ranked above a 5-star ranking consisting of one review.

I see a new westerners come here to Taiwan every year, many with grandiose goals of ""mastering"" Chinese.  So far, it has broken every one of them, including myself.  After six years, I can muddle my way through the Apple Daily and converse at a native-like level about topics I'm very familiar with, but all my illusions of becoming ""literate"" or ""speaking flawlessly"" died long ago.<p>Even now my Chinese isn't sufficient to get me a job without the benefit of having my English skills as well.  Learning Chinese has been great on a personal level, but in terms of career, it was one of the most expensive decisions I've ever made.",1226645779

As you're using it here, the word ""identify"" should be ""identifies"":<p>>>> For every stock we create an index that measures market and sector influence and identify the news that make the difference. <<<<p>But I think you're trying to say too much in that sentence anyways.  A simpler and better statement that's easier to understand and probably has greater impact might be this:<p>>>> We measure market influences for every stock in America, and we identify the news that makes a difference. <<<<p>If you use this new wording you can pay me $1000 ... :)<p>Aside from this change, I like the grab-and-pull interface that works like google maps, but I'm not into investing so I don't know if real investors will find any value here.",1226644611

You can find GWB making speeches about this in 2003. They also failed to regulate the markets where the bad debts were being sold with good credit ratings. Incompetant yes, immoral no.<p>The banks intentionally obscured the value of the bad debts to other investors. And greedy people were encouraged to get second and third homes when they didn't need to by greedy real estate agents. That was immoral.",1226644217

(I know every person who makes an HTML thinks this, but I truly think that the few pages we've finalized are superb.)<p>Next semester, I'm in an advanced PHP course - enough to really firm up the things I'm working on. I'll probably have a prototype made winter break, so I'll be able to fix up the beta and stabilize it as part of that class, and have a working model in time to apply for YCombinator this summer.<p>I'm working with other PHP projects so I can get confident enough in PHP to make my site. The code for it is really simple: one of the things that makes me certain about my idea is that it's an incredibly basic one that hasn't been used in the way I'll be using it. I'm not too worried about it getting complex, so I'll know exactly when I'm ready to dash it out. But HTML first.",1226644078
364046,comment,363358,363789,0,0,netcan,,,"<i>Does the classical model really work though?</i><p>I took 'classical model' to mean basically use what's out there. Adsense or something similar or starting their own ad program that works similarly to adsense or using an ad program similar to what NYT or many other big news networks use & giving it generous screespace. Something like this:\n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.whsites.net/mediakit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.whsites.net/mediakit/</a> . I assume that NYT supplement whatever pageviews they cannot sell directly with adsense. Basically by classical model, I understood 'go with what the world is currently offering'.<p><i>Has anyone tried measuring this?</i><p>Yes people have measured this. You can be sure that media sites (newspapers & such) do. They probably have the optimal configurations.<p>It is possible to get some more clicks (even purposeful ones), by making them bigger & noisier. Up to a point.",1226643711
364045,comment,363408,363408,0,0,danteembermage,,,"I think what you've got here has a lot of potential; let me echo some things and maybe make some other suggestions.<p>First, I think it is a great idea decomposing stock variance. Really, I do want to know what moved my stock. However, it's not really clear what your chart is telling me. I see market and I see the stock price and I see that they are different but I don't know why they are different. What I'd imagined was suppose you start with the return on the value weighted Wilshire 5000 possibly adjusted by empirical beta. Presumably there will be some residual price movement, some of that is coming from sector changes. It would make sense to see the sector effect as a different color tacked on to the market effect. Then you add news effects and then the leftover would be unknown or some such. Perhaps on news days you assume all the residual movement is due to news and then carry forward that price difference through the non-news periods.<p>As you've got it I assumed your chart was just comparing the stock return with the return on the S&P until I read the comments here. You're news history and the associated price change is awesome, in academic finance there is a long tradition of doing event studies (e.g. what is the effect on a stock price to an announcement of a seasoned equity offering?). If I understand what you're doing you've essentially done an event study of every possible event for all stocks throughout time. That's pretty cool. In fact, if you used academic standard methods calculating your expected returns you might even have a dataset that research universities would be interested in buying from you.<p>One possible thing traders might like that you might be able to pull off. Suppose I'm worried a stock is going to get hit with an ""identify theft"" leak. If you put a little text processing on your news titles you could determine the average effect that kind of announcement will have on the average and maybe for a stock in particular. So lets imagine ""identity theft"" has an average negative return of six percent. Then I check identity theft with American Standard and I get 0.1 percent because the negative identity theft returns are linked with banking and retail sector returns and not really with the market.<p>I'm a little worried that your design is too cutesy. I would expect websites that do lots of statistics to have more hard corners. I understand you want the site to look accessible but you want it to appear intelligent and accessible. There's got to be a compromise in between somewhere.",1226643602

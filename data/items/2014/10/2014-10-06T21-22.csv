Sure, if there&#x27;s a full movie on YT, there&#x27;s a plausible mechanism for lost sales so request a takedown.<p>But if it&#x27;s a 3 minute clip from a 90 minute movie, are they really believing that someone who would have previously bought the movie is content to be watching it in 3 minute snippets on the web?<p>It seems far more likely the opposite is going to happen which is that people are going to be exposed to movies they&#x27;ve never heard about before and be more pre-disposed to buy the full version.

For CGI, this is the way things are done, and most Perl scripts interact with the web server through CGI.

8418496,comment,8417912,8417912,1,0,daltonlp,,,"The first two paragraphs illustrate a huge problem with US math education, which pre-dates common core, but is reinforced by it.<p>That problem is the false belief that numeracy is improved by learning different ways of looking at number operations.  (i.e. four ways to subtract).<p>Our child&#x27;s second-grade teacher (a very good teacher) has a poster illustrating 7 ways to subtract.  Seven ways, no exaggeration.  This poster is older than common core.<p>Students learn math just like they learn to kick a ball. By practicing.   Learn one way to subtract, and practice it really really well.   Or learn two ways, and practice each way really, really well.   Learn more ways if you want, but practice each way really really well.   Most math curriculums assume that learning multiple ways is equivalent to (or better than) practicing one way.  They don&#x27;t require the repetitive practice.<p>As comments have pointed out, the common core standards don&#x27;t explicitly require this multi-way approach.  But the CC standards compound the problem by requiring students to <i>explain</i> concepts in order to demonstrate mastery.  Completing lots of subtraction problems with a low rate of error doesn&#x27;t count.  You must <i>explain</i>, in order to understand.   And if you <i>really</i> understand, shouldn&#x27;t you be able to explain different approaches?<p>I would say no.  Or at least, not yet.  I don&#x27;t want a third-grader explaining how to subtract unless they can also finish 50 subtraction problems in a row without pausing to struggle.  And if they get the problems right?  Good job, you get an A.  Wonderful, let&#x27;s skip grading the explanation because that is subjective as hell.<p>TL/DR:  The article rightly points out a crap way to teach math.  Common core is not totally to blame, but it makes a bad problem worse.",1412631998

It&#x27;s only something you can claim in a court.<p>YouTube is obliged to respond to claims immediately under the safe harbor laws, but they are not obliged to continue pushing if a user disputes the claim. At that point it should be handed off to the claimant so they can pursuit further action and YouTube is off the hook.<p>YouTube is doing more work than they need to, but probably because it costs them less effort and time to just side with copyright claim holders and act as a thorn to users who would use the content.<p>Whether something is &quot;Fair Use&quot; is still pretty ill defined and depends on a number of factors. I agree that this use would likely win in court with a claim of Fair Use (and I am not a lawyer but I&#x27;ve had some experience enforcing and responding to copyright claims, and have interfaced with lawyers who do know about them). The problem is that it will only win when both parties go to court, and the cost of that is high enough that the copyright owner holds a ridiculous amount of power since it will always be monolith versus one-off alleged-offender, which is the particular kind of bullshit being smelled by jwz.<p>edit: My guess on why they do it this way rather than just handing it off is that a great deal of effort is required to correctly identify users for claims, and if YouTube takes on that responsibility, they need to make sure they are not passing on the name/address of someone who is lying about their identity. Rather than making people jump through hoops to get their actual identity to pass to the copyright owner for litigation, they delay the process as long as possible.",1412631868

Certainly it has happened, but in all reality it&#x27;s not easy to steal technology or IP.<p>For example, let&#x27;s take the TechForward V Best Buy mentioned by another commenter. TechForward had an interesting but not terribly novel idea. They shared the idea with Best Buy and Best Buy stole it and recreated it with their own mathematicians, actuaries, and programmers. Was what they did wrong? Yes. Was it stealing their code from their repository and then just deploying with the Best Buy logo on it? No, not at all. The point being that if your idea is not really novel and could easily be rebuilt by a team that is bigger, smarter, or well funded, well you are probably in trouble.<p>With that in mind, the more common situation is that they actually think you are very skilled and would make an interesting addition to their teams, environment, and company. If you are open to an aquihire or joint venture because as you say they &quot;have the right resources to take [y]our product very big very fast&quot;, by all means state YOUR desire. Generally when I have asked to see a companies code during due diligence on a product that isn&#x27;t even released yet, it can be thought of like an extended technical interview. I would be happy 9 times out of 10 to hear from the potential aquihire-ies &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re in this project $x amount, we&#x27;d like an exit like $y with a job at the end that gives us ABCD&quot;. It would safe them and the company a ton of time, effort, and money.

Nobody can really tell you what you should do if you don&#x27;t know yourself what you want. Getting a lawyer is pretty much the only reasonable response I&#x27;ve seen so far, because it can never hurt. But even then it is important that you know what you want, to find a good lawyer for your cause, and because a lawyer is a contractor himself and like you he would like to know what is customer wants before he can be really efficient. The second advice that always works is that you never deal with &quot;The Big Corp&quot; but with a guy or a team working in that big corp. While the corp might be reputable the guy might not be (and the other way around, though less likely). Learn to know these guys, not the corp. Both these tips (lawyer, learning to know people not roles/organisations) always works in every really important daily situation, not just start-ups, btw.<p>Do you want to get bought? Then start thinking about a fair price of your company. And start about an incredibly big number you would be happy to retire with. If you can find a result in between these numbers you will probably be doing not too badly. If you don&#x27;t get close to either number, then you might change to the next goal.<p>Do you want to grow bigger to sell out bigger? Then look for a cooperation but keep your independence as much as possible. That includes keeping your company value secret (which is often more likely your market research than your source code).<p>Do you want to change the world? Well then try to find out what and how much they are willing to do. If they don&#x27;t care about the cause, say &quot;bye&quot;.<p>Do you just want to experiment, learn new stuff, keep your freedom? Then have a look about how much of that is left when they integrate you. You can&#x27;t find out about this in a meeting room discussing with them, because they&#x27;ll promise you anything in that regard. Look how the other people work in that corp. Are they creative, smart, free-loving animals, or are they cubicle workers who love to blame everything that happens around them on middle management? That&#x27;s what you can expect after 1-2 years of integration.<p>Do you maybe actually hate the undefined future and hours of unlimited work of a start-up? This might be the best chance for you to get out. Getting integrated means you might end up in middle management with a decent pay and some savings from the sale in your bank account. That&#x27;s way, way better than anybody can hope coming directly from university.<p>And one last tip, because I personally always struggled with knowing what I wanted when I was younger: Define a random goal. Choose one from them, maybe even using a dice. Doesn&#x27;t matter. A bad specific goal can be changed when you finally know you hate it. A lot of unspecified goals get you nowhere.",1412631620

For starters the employee&#x27;s actual identity is apparently known and there are comments in one of the threads indicating hiring managers at other companies have taken note of him (negatively). Secondly, being the CEO of a YC company means he&#x27;s &quot;in the club.&quot; Short of explicitly defrauding investors, the limit to this guy&#x27;s personal risk is very lilely that he may be forced out of his CEO role. Unless he&#x27;s a very stupid person he has put enough untouchable wealth aside to be just fine should this occur. Even if he hasn&#x27;t I would suggest his chances of securing funding for another company is not impacted by this drama negatively (in fact, it may have a positive effect).<p>Besides that, even if he did have more at stake personally that is insufficient reason to take his word over the employee&#x27;s, because there&#x27;s nothing even close to any objective evidence in such a determination: it&#x27;s purely subjective based on your own biases.",1412629218

(if you want a good example of this, I recommend the &quot;critical hit&quot; podcast[1], although be warned you&#x27;ll need to listen to literally hundreds of hours of people playing D&D, which is not ideal if you&#x27;re only interested in the story&#x27;s interactivity.)<p>I thought they missed a trick not analysing Dishonoured a bit more though, as the game world reflects your playing style (high/low chaos).

Why should I have a dog in that fight?<p>Put aside developing countries for a moment - in the US, the three credit bureaus are very heavily regulated, and as a consumer, you have a lot of rights regarding your credit report.<p>Experian must provide you with free access to your credit report every year, they must explicitly mark any negative information, they must give you the right to challenge any incorrect information, and even if negative information is correct, they can only hold onto it for a certain period of time.<p>They also are limited in the ways that they can share this information with others, and in the ways that they can join the information from your credit report with other information that they or others may have in order to create a more &quot;complete&quot; profile about you.<p>This regulation is all <i>very</i> good, as it limits the extent to which one&#x27;s credit history can harm one&#x27;s prospects at financial progress (or even basic necessities of life, as even rental applications often ask for your credit history). It also means that someone in their 40s is not still being held back by poor credit decisions from their 20s that caused them to declare bankruptcy in their early 30s.<p>If Facebook were actually subject to all of these same regulations (and we trusted them to abide by them), it would be one thing, but I&#x27;d be very skeptical of how Facebook would handle this responsibility either in the US or in developing countries.",1407090465

It&#x27;s far more space-efficient to insert two tabs instead of 8 spaces, but space and bandwidth are so cheap these days, no one can be arsed to fix what is viewed as a minor problem (use enough spaces and sooner or later, we&#x27;re talking real bandwidth).<p>Then, there&#x27;s the moment where we have to decide what those all those tabs (and sometimes spaces) mean, depending on the language, the layout rules, personal preferences, etc. For example, some people write Python with 2 spaces at the beginning of a line (which is plainly heresy). Others write it with 4 spaces (which is damnable blasphemy).

Years ago, processor speeds evolved slowly enough that it was practical for game developers to write all animation delays in their games something like this:<p><pre><code>    for (i=0; i<400; i++) ;\n</code></pre>\nThey would test their delay value and then increase their loop count as necessary. This was a lot easier than doing clock-based delays. I&#x27;m not sure how it was on Windows/DOS at the time, but around the same era on MacOS, you couldn&#x27;t even get millisecond accuracy without a lot of effort. The standard time unit on a Mac then was the tick, or 1/60th of a second, and some things didn&#x27;t look too nice at tick granularity.<p>So this kind of time delay in games and other software was common practice. When processors did start getting significantly faster, some games became unplayable or bugged out altogether.<p>Along came the turbo button: it didn&#x27;t actually make your computer faster, it made it <i>slower</i>. Because of the confusing name, the turbo button was usually rigged so that you would leave it on by default -- using your processor&#x27;s manufactured clock speed -- but if you wanted to play an older game that relied on processor speed for delay timing, you would deactivate the turbo, slowing your system clock speed down to something that matched older hardware.",1407089944

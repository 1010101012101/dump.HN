4477746,comment,4477376,4477511,4,0,dclusin,,,"I work for a finance related technology provider and as a consequence get to see the technology practices of many brokers and other market makers. Often times their security is just as bad. The key difference is that trade settlement (a.k.a clearing) is a separate process (usually also separate company from exchange). This adds a layer of security because compromising the exchange doesn't always get you access to the clearing details. Clearing details are usually things like ""Depoist X million dollars in bank account A, I will deposit x million euros in your bank account B."" With Bitcoin quoting, trading, and clearing are all rolled into one.",1346813942

4477726,comment,4477671,4477671,3,0,david_shaw,,,"Okay, let's get the first part out of the way really quickly: this would be an amazing piece of technology, if it were to be implemented successfully. Having a password that even <i>you</i> don't consciously know would be a huge leap in security, and would presumably make password guessing all but impossible--after all, if you don't need to <i>remember</i> your password in the traditional sense, it could be significantly more complex than traditional ""Pa55w0rd1!""-style passphrases.<p>I, personally, don't know enough about the science behind this to comment on its feasibility.<p>I do, however, know a lot about security in general. Every time there is a leap in ""password technology,"" meaning public key authentication, or password-keepers, or xkcd's ""let's use several words instead of random characters,"" people seem to think that it would protect all their online assets. That if the password is secure, so is their data that's stored somewhere on the Internet.<p>On one hand, yes, this technology would easily protect you from brute-force and dictionary-based attacks. After all, if there's no dictionary (because no words are used in the secret ""pattern,""), how could a dictionary be used to attack the protected account?<p>What isn't factored into this example is the service you're protecting <i>itself</i>. If you look at high profile breaches over the last year, you'll notice that few, if any of them are straightforward password-guess breaches. Sure, some (like the Wired journalist) could have been prevented with strong and unique passphrases. Most of the attacks could not.<p>If there is, for example, a buffer overflow in a service that is listening on the Internet, remote code execution may be possible. If you can execute arbitrary code on a remote service, you are able to effectively take over that machine. Combine this with privilege escalation, and it's pretty much game over for most data stored there. Proper database security like unique salts per user account can minimize the damage, but the fact is that the compromise still happened and the data--like your personal photos, or documents uploaded to cloud storage--are probably in the hands of an attacker.<p>It's always great to see cutting edge research in any field related to computer security, but don't think that ""passwords even <i>you</i> don't know!"" are going to protect anything behind them. Passwords are just the front door to the mansion, and there's a whole lot of other ways to break in.<p>The short version is that there will always be a difference between <i>account</i> security and <i>application</i> security.",1346813510

You don't add some number of bytes to the pointer, you add the number of elements by which to increment.<p>In other words, incrementing a uint8_t* will add one byte to the pointer address, but a uint32_t* will add four bytes, and a pointer to a 64-byte struct will add 64 bytes.<p>Here's an example.

We were bound to use the law as it is today. The patents were issued the judge instructed us not to second guess the current patent system.<p>Groklaw Commentary: The law is that the jurors are supposed to decide whether or not a patent is infringed, which <i>includes</i> whether or not the patent is valid, because if it is not valid, it can't be infringed.""<p>Whoever wrote the commentary doesn't understand the patent law. The question of ""is the patent valid"" actually encompasses several different questions, some of which are for the judge to decide and some of which are for the jury to decide. The jury foreman's characterization of ""is this something that should be patentable?"" is correct. This is the ""subject matter"" question. It asks: ""in general, is this kind of thing the kind of thing that should be patentable?"" This is a legal question that is in the judge's province, not the jury's.<p>The jury decides patent validity, which encompasses a separate set of questions. If a particular ""kind of thing"" is patentable, then the jury looks at whether a particular thing that is of that ""kind of thing"" has been validly patented.",1346811891

Bear in mind, this guarantee is over a 12-month period, so there's plenty of time to make that $10k on your own.

I inhaled business book after business book once done with engineering school.  And, I played the game.  And I got my ass handed to me.<p>In the real world price elasticity works within a very narrow range that is industry and product specific and can --and usually is-- highly dependent on a huge number of external factors.<p>Discounts are one of my favorite.  Believe me when I say that I've played that game multiple times.  I used to own an electronics manufacturing business that made products for industrial and professional applications.  I had to face the reality of product from Korea and China entering the market at half my price and offering 60% of my value.  The result, no matter what I did, was the huge sucking sound of sales leaving for the competition.<p>Lower your prices you say?  Did that.  Multiple times.  In multiple creative ways.  Eventually matching their prices and accepting lower profits.  ""We'll make it up in volume"".  Bullshit!  Maybe I sold 1% more product.  That's it.<p>OK, how about more value.  Did that.  Multiple times.  Added features.  Added mind-numbing technology.  No-go.<p>We are talking about products costing thousands of dollars per unit here.  The fact was that people, particularly as the economy got worst, wanted Walmart, not Gucci.  And so the business went to what they perceived to be the cheapest they could get.<p>Don't get me started on Asian companies dumping to kill-off competition.  Nasty.<p>OK, well, how about the high end.  I had very high end product as well.  $50K per unit and above.  High performance.  The best of the best.  Volume, just like the taylor in the article, sucked.  We could make these ""Ferrari's"" but it was sheer pain and suffering, financially speaking.  The general theory was that we'd sell a high-end unit and also sell a lot more lower-end units along with them.  Nice dream.<p>So, raise prices?  Sure.  Why not?  The problem is that people are only willing to pay so much for what they are buying.  The ""how much"" is a multivariable problem that is nearly impossible to solve.  This is certainly true for a taylor who only makes a few dozen suits per year.  He can't experiment with pricing too much as word of mouth would destroy his business.  If customer B learns that he paid more for the suit that his friend, customer A bought all hell breaks loose.<p>I know I sound very negative about this.  I am just looking at it from the perspective of having experienced failure in price elasticity due to the product I was pushing existing in a very narrow trading margin.  Volume couldn't really scale at the bottom or at the top due to different factors and price at the top was limited by what people were willing to pay for the product category.<p>Perhaps he can charge more for additional services that he might not be monetizing.  One example might be to extend the delivery time on his standard $4,000 suit and charge a $1,000 fee for faster delivery.  In effect he would be raising his actual per-unit price, but it would be in the context of easily communicable value.  In the prior example, customers A and B would have on issue with what each paid because the conversation would quickly identify that B got his expedited, which costs money.<p>He could also take in an apprentice and see about offloading some of the work.  My family owned several clothing manufacturing plants and so I am also familiar with aspects of this business.  There's a lot that can be done by less skilled workers if one is smart enough to setup systems to make this happen.<p>Finally, he might be very well served taking his problem to a local business school to see about getting help from one of their various programs.  His business could very easily become the subject of a class and he could have a small army of consultants helping him move it out of the garage.",1346811340

My first suits and blazers were all off the rack, including the high end brooks brothers. And they all fit me horribly.

So from someone who wasted a lot of money do yourself a favor, go to the best shirt maker in your city and have a custom shirt made. Be prepared to spend up to $300 for the shirt (though $200 is more reasonable). Then use that as your template and send it to a tailor in hong kong who will make duplicates of the shirt with the same measurement for $30 each in the fabric selection of your choice. Best investment ever. I recommend <a href=""http://www.jantzentailor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jantzentailor.com/</a><p>For suits, I can't help you if you are in America.

Also, crazy valuations put on companies that don't turn a profit. Generally in business, a company is worth its annual turnover if a sale was going to happen. How are companies that are turning over 0 worth 15 billion?<p>I think everyone has forgotten about the .com crash 10 years ago and thats where all this crazy investment is coming from. Google offering 6 billion for Groupon, then Groupon turning it down??<p>I think the only thing that would not describe this as a bubble, is the exeprience of the last bubble and what it has taught us. We have learned now what the ""internet"" is. We have learned its boundaries (as such) and therefore we can make a reasonable evaluation on what the next ""big thing"" is and whether it will all come crashing down.<p>I for one, slag Facebook off to death. I think Mark Zuckerburg is a robbing bastard that stole someones idea and ran with it himself. The thing is, it's the ideas that he didn't steal that make him and the site brilliant. Facebook too did not have a business model and even after creating the advertisting it did not do much. Now, when Facebook started doing targeted advertising and to a greater extent, the new location based advertising, that's when it became brilliant in my eyes. These non-profit start ups that eventually find a business model that works are where the real treats are and its the fact that these startups are finding a business model that makes this a new era, rather than a bubble.<p>To coin a phrase, its the face of things to come.

2233449,comment,2229758,2229758,0,0,gus_massa,,,"I think that the explanation is wrong (or at least it is a oversimplification.)<p>The main problem is that the explanation ignores completely the air. Static air is a good isolator, therefore much of the heat must be transported by thermal convection or forced convection (blowing). If the air doesn't move, it wouldn't be useful to make each part of the coffee visit the surface.<p>The second problem is that the it says that most of the heat is lost by evaporation of the water molecules (latent evaporation heat). I think that this is true when the temperature is over 195 F/90 C. But when the water is cooler  I think that thermal conduction is more important, and it is  not related to the ""high-kinetic-energy outlier water molecules"". And also some heat is lost by the floor and walls of the cup, but I think that most of the heat is lost by the surface. [More details in ""experiment"" bellow.]<p>The third problem is more an oversimplification. It is incorrect imagine that some of the molecules of the water are ""high-kinetic-energy outlier"". Let imagine that we mentally ""paint"" the fast molecules at initial time. Very soon these molecules will bounce with other molecules and change their velocity, so a few instants later the fast molecules will be other molecules. To estimate the time that we have to wait until the fast molecules bounce we can use the ""mean free time"". This time is useful in a gas where the molecules are far apart, and for air in usual conditions it is ~5E-10seg. Obviously water is not a gas, but the molecules are more close together, so this the time we should wait is much smaller. But the time that a drop of water needs to go from the bottom to the top of the cup is 
~.1 seg (rough estimation). So the molecules have time to bounce and bounce. Moreover, while the drop is traveling though the surface the molecules have time to bounce and reach thermal equilibrium after some of then evaporate. So I think that a macroscopic model that only consider the temperature should work.<p>[experiment]<p>A few yeas ago, I worked at a school and we need an experiment for a physic olympiad. We measure the cooling of a plastic cup of water in different conditions. The idea was that the temperature follow a law like:<p><pre><code>  Temp = Constant * exp(-time/tau) + Temp_external
</code></pre>
Taking logarithms<p><pre><code>  log(Temp-Temp_external) = - time/tau + Konstant 
</code></pre>
So it is possible to make a graphic of the log(Temp-Temp_external) and from the slope get the value of tau. In an ideal case, tau is a constant (or almost constant) that depends on the materials and the sizes of the experiment.<p>Really tau is not constant. When the temperature if below 195 F/90 C the value of tau is almost constant and the graphic of the log is a nice line.<p>But when the water is hotter tau is not constant, the bigger the temperature, the bigger is tau (IIRC perhaps like twice the cold value). So the graphic of the log is curved and the water cooled faster than expected.<p>When the temperature if above 195 F/90 C something strange was happening. Looking at the cups we see that above that temperature there was a lot of steam over the cups and bellow that temperature the seam almost disappear. Looking at the graphics of the vapor pressure of water we saw that above 195 F/90 C the vapor pressure is bigger than the value bellow 195 F/90 C. So we expect to have a lot of evaporation when the water is hot and few evaporation when it is cold.<p>So the conclusion was that when the water is cold most of the heat is exchanged by conduction and convection, but when the water is hotter the evaporation is and additional important part of the cooling effects.<p>Note 1: We did some additional experiments that are consistent with this explanation, but perhaps there is something we forgot to check.<p>Note 2: The change between the ""hot"" and ""cold"" water above and bellow 195 F/90 C was not sharp. While the water was cooling the steam get thiner softly, tau get lower softly and the vapor pressure gets null softly. So the number 195 F/90 C is only an approximation. (And it was a few years ago.)<p>Note 3: Heat flow is difficult to modelate in paper, so better measure it experimentally. ""In theory, practice is the same as theory. In practice, it differs.""",1297986501

2233417,comment,2230710,2231385,0,0,akashs,,,"So in my mind, the reason this upsets people is this:  Imagine you bought a Sony TV and all you could ever watch on it was Sony produced movies, tv shows, and Sony music unless the other studios gave them 30% of the revenue.  You can even only hook up a PS3 and Sony speakers, and there's no other way to get something on the TV but by going through Sony.<p>Is there still tons of great content?  Sure.  Do the original artists have a right to go elsewhere?  Sure.  Could the other studios afford to take the hit? No.  Would the other studios make deals with the other TV manufacturers?  Probably.  But because of their position, you as the owner of a Sony TV wouldn't get to watch some awesome movies and same for people who bought another type of TV.  In order to reach a Sony TV customer, Sony would be forcing artists to have Sony produce their content, and that's where it's anticompetitive.<p>Stepping back to reality, how crazy is this analogy?  Well how different really is an iPad from a 10"" TV?  Sony TVs play movies, music, have apps, etc, etc just like an iPad.  Sure in the real world, you need a special partnership with Sony to install your apps onto the actual TV, but there's tons of other ways to get your content onto the TV.  Difference here is that Apple has blocked off any of those other channels.  And that's why it's an issue.",1297985960

2233380,comment,2231352,2232966,0,0,davidmathers,,,"Aside: Here's an example of what ""new paradigm"" language actually sounds like. This from the real estate bubble (and Bob Toll is Bertrand Russell compared to what the ""new economics"" people were saying in the tech bubble). New York Times:<p>In the past couple of years, Toll and his deputies have begun analyzing European housing data to see if they hold any lessons for a maturing American housing market. Toll has been talking up the research to stock analysts and the financial press for the past year. His conclusions carry a whiff of new-paradigm thinking, but he nevertheless seems convinced that Europe's present-day reality is America's destiny. I asked Toll what our children - my kids are both under 8, I told him - would be paying when they're ready to buy. ""They're going to live with us until they're 40,"" Toll said matter-of-factly. ""And when they have their second kid, then we'll finally kick them out and make them pay for the house that we paid for. And that house will cost them 45 to 50 percent of their income.""<p>I grew alarmed. Was he kidding? He assured me he was not. ""It's all just logic,"" Toll said. ""In Britain you pay seven times your annual income for a home; in the U.S. you pay three and a half."" The British get 330 square feet, per person, in their homes; in the U.S., we get 750 square feet. Not only does Toll say he believes the next generation of buyers will be paying twice as much of their annual incomes; in terms of space, he also seems to think they're going to get only half as much. ""And that average, million-dollar insane home in the burbs? It's going to be $4 million.""<p>...<p>One idea that shapes the outlook of real-estate economists is the notion that cities, in a rough conceptual sense, are replacements for one another. A city is founded, and residents and industries settle there; over time, that city and its metro area might reach a population of a million residents. As demand to live there increases and the supply of good land diminishes, housing gets more expensive. But lo, another city arises nearby, where land is cheaper and jobs are plentiful. Residents can now leave the first big city, if they choose, and move to the second, smaller city. Until, that is, the second city becomes large and crowded and expensive as well. Then another city grows nearby, and so on. As pressure on prices and land builds, a new city can act as a pressure release.<p>It's possible that this model has broken down over the past few years. A small cadre of economists, in fact, has begun to ask whether the irrepressible inflation of home values in many coastal metro areas actually reflects a deeper logic based on the straitened land supply in these cities. Boom-time rationalists always run the risk of earning a black mark of infamy like that worn by the Yale professor Irving Fisher. (Just before the 1929 stock-market crash, Fisher declared that stocks had reached ""what looks like a permanently high plateau."") And it is virtually impossible to find an economist - or a home builder, for that matter - who thinks the recent growth rates in home prices are sustainable; even the most sanguine among them predict more moderate appreciation over the long run. Yet almost without exception these thinkers, though they come from different political persuasions and even different research specialties, have attributed high home prices to zoning. Further, they have amassed a fair amount of data to support their arguments.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/magazine/16brothers.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/magazine/16brothers.html?p...</a>",1297985120

It was a house of cards that eventually came down. It earns its bubble label because two things happened:<p>1. Funding dried up to the point that legitimate businesses couldn't get funded or failed; and<p>2. The ramifications of the bubble extended far beyond dot-com companies.<p>Do we have something like that now? IMHO no. But I think we do have a valuation bubble of sorts. The system is awash with money (particularly Russian money) but what you have to remember is that we're still talking about far less money than in 2000.<p>In 2000 there were no angel rounds (per se) and companies weren't bootstrapped or funded on $250k or less. It was pretty much straight to a $5m+ Series A due to the (then) high costs of servers, software licenses and bandwidth.<p>Now you can build a prototype of something for as little as $10-50K. Infrastructure costs are almost zero (for a prototype). The only major cost left really is developer time and $250k will pay for 2-3 developers for a year (at a mix of salary+equity). That same venture would've required an order of magnitude more money in 2000.<p>So I think what you'll see is that a lot of angels will lose their shirts in the next few years or simply get poor returns. The same applies to the lower end of seed funds. But I don't think funding will dry up to the same extent simply because the market has many more participants, we're talking about far less money (both in total and per investment) and the barrier to entry is so much lower than it used to.<p>Now, this may translate into a problem where angel-funded companies can't get Series A/B funding and thus fail but with many companies reaching profitability with very small amounts of money the only real impact will be (IMHO) consolidation (today we have some significant players--Google, Facebook and Apple for example--swimming in cash and ready to write big checks even for talent acquisition) and the adoption of more lean-and-mean approaches, which can hardly be a bad thing.<p>Where ordinary investors could really lose out is on companies like Facebook. The early investors will (and have) made out like bandits but honestly I can see that bubble bursting at some point in the future.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania</a>",1297984869

2233351,comment,2232306,2232306,0,0,mjfern,,,"> <i>First, Apple has the tablet component market sewn up. An entrepreneur I talked to in China described the difficulty he still has buying touchscreens that are worth a darn. The real reason most of the current tablets are 7 inches? Because Apple bought up all of the 10-inch capacitive touchscreen stock and if they didn’t then they drove the price too high for smaller orders. There is no way to dabble in the market without paying a premium.</i><p>Most people attribute Apple’s stunning financial performance to its differentiated products, which integrate excellent hardware, software, and content. If you dig deeper, however, you realize that other critical factors have played a substantial role in Apple’s financial performance over the last decade.<p>One factor rarely discussed in detail, but that has significant impact on Apple’s success, is the way in which the company manages the critical forces within its industry. There are five key industry forces, according to Michael E. Porter, but here I just want to focus on one force: “the bargaining power of suppliers.”<p>Let’s start with the iPod and iPhone. Most iPod’s except for the “Classic,” rely on flash memory -- instead of a hard drive -- for storage. The benefits of flash memory are reliability, form factor, and energy consumption. Realizing the significant benefits of flash memory for portable media devices, Apple formed long-term relationships with Samsung, Intel, and Micron, and by mid-2007 commanded about 25% of worldwide flash production.<p>Fast forward to today, and we are seeing a similar scenario unfold for the iPad and the tablet market. It turns out that Apple has secured about 60% of global touch panel capacity, with a focus on 10-inch displays. As mentioned in the article, this has forced some competitors to initially focus on devices with 7-inch screens, such as Samsung with its Galaxy Tab.<p>What’s the effect of commanding such a large portion of the worldwide supply of a key component for a product?<p>First, because Apple is buying these components in such large quantities it can exercise significant leverage over suppliers. This leverage enables Apple to negotiate favorable terms and pricing. For instance, South Korean Fair Trade officials alleged that Apple struck a special deal with Samsung to obtain flash chips at below market rates. This favorable pricing means that Apple has a lower cost structure for its products relative to competing products. And all else equal, this lower cost structure results in higher margins for Apple versus a competitor.<p>Second, when Apple commands such a large portion of the global market for a key component it creates enormous barriers to entry for potential competitors. Competitors can obtain the component in limited quantities but at a higher price, therefore placing the competitor at a cost disadvantage. Next, the competitor can launch a different product -- a hard drive based portable media device or a 7-inch touch screen tablet – that may not match the preferences of consumers. Alternatively, the competitor can just sit and wait until more supply of the component is made available, which in some cases takes years.<p>In sum, Apple’s financial success as a company hinges in part on commercializing differentiated products. But this is just part of the story. As important to Apple’s success is the company’s strategy around managing key industry forces. As described above, Apple’s control over the worldwide market for key components has reduced Apple’s cost structure and has created significant barriers to entry for competitors. This yields significantly higher margins and market share for Apple, among other benefits.",1297984727

For (B) there are some tens of billions of rectangular green reasons to keep it quite secret until some good lawyers have done good things with patents.<p>Idea (A) is just a broad concept of a new product.

Such ideas do need to be kept secret, say, as in Top Secret in the US DoD, secret before have protection from the USPTO, or trade secret.<p>If it is obvious and easy to do (A), then I would conclude that there was no technological advantage, no technological barrier to entry, and would would have to look for a special reason to try.<p>I'm interested only in an (A) when no one else knows how to do it very well and I figured out (B) that does do it well along with the other usual criteria -- many people are eager for the solution and ready to pay; can deliver the solution for much less than can get paid for it; etc.<p>I confess I'm shocked that people here on HN neglect the role of (B).<p>I was even more shocked when KP's J.

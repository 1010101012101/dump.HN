I can't find a picture on line but you can see it in the scene with the glass bottle. That was done by integration with a separate render but since then RenderMan as added support for GI and other ray tracing features.<p>I'm sure this update is significant, and sounds like a ground up reworking of the engine, perhaps replacing REYES? But it's not at all accurate to say the Pixar is moving to raytracing.  Pixar has been in that neighborhood for more then a decade.",1369771179

Fascists seek to unify their nation through a totalitarian state that promotes the mass mobilization of the national community,[3][4] relying on a vanguard party to initiate a revolution to organize the nation on fascist principles. Hostile to liberal democracy, socialism, and communism, fascist movements share certain common features, including the veneration of the state, a devotion to a strong leader, and an emphasis on ultranationalism, ethnocentrism, and militarism.""<p>Yeah, Singapore is nothing like that. The fact that 20%+ of its population are immigrants, and how it embraces immigration, disproves your pet theory. Singaporeans don't have statues of their leaders in their homes, and they're not mobilizing anyone to fight some greater evil.

Then whenever you want to write code something like that:<p><pre><code>  func() {\n    call_callback();\n    do_something();\n  }\n</code></pre>\nInstead you do:<p><pre><code>  func() {\n    push after_callback_event;\n    return call_callback();\n  }\n\n  after_callback_event() {\n    do_something();\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe LIFO nature of the event queue guarantees the expected event processing order, that is, the after_callback_event() is invoked after call_callback(), including any events call_callback() itself pushes, recursively.<p>The other thing that helps a lot is to reduce coupling in your code. With reduced coupling, the ""what can be called back when I call this"" problem becomes much simpler. Components can't call other components that they don't know about.<p>I can say that by applying the LIFO and taking care to decouple my components properly, my event driven code is certainly not suffering from the ""callback hell"". Quite the opposite, I think it is nice and correct :) I'm talking about the programs in my open source project here, <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/</a> .",1369770300

Your mileage may vary.<p>I stopped short at the beginning of the second paragraph:<p><i>Every talk is for an audience, and it's the speaker's responsibility to say what the audience needs to hear.</i><p>Wait, what? Yes, every talk is for an audience, but that just means you have to know where your audience is coming from in order to communicate. You don't give a talk full of programming jargon to an audience of businesspeople that know nothing about programming except that they often need to hire programmers.<p>But to me, the second part of that statement sounds like something a con man would say. You say whatever it is you came there to say; whether it's ""what the audience needs to hear"" is irrelevant. (Of course the audience is presumably interested in what you have to say; otherwise, how did you get the speaking gig in the first place? But to me, a speaker who worries about ""what the audience needs to hear"" is not a speaker I will put much credence in. I want a speaker who will say what he thinks, regardless of its impact on me.)<p>Then there's this, later on:<p><i>one of the most powerful and important statements you'll ever hear...</i><p><i>Right now, today, we can't see the thing, at all, that's going to be the most important 100 years from now.</i><p>100 years? How about 10 years? Our inability to predict the future works on much shorter timescales than he seems to think. Why the emphasis on 100 years?<p>Oh:<p><i>I personally care about mattering 100 years from now.</i><p>As another commenter here pointed out, if your work still matters 100 years from now it probably means your field has stagnated. Even getting your <i>tools for thinking</i> to matter 100 years from now is a longshot; are you Einstein? Are you Shannon? Sure, those are ideals to aspire to, but the very nature of large numbers means most of us won't end up there.<p>I see the writer's general point, and I even agree with it: having better tools to think with can have a far greater impact than building one particular thing.

5781988,comment,5779473,5779473,7,0,nekopa,,,"Great idea, I just have one question, how will you make money? You have a great idea which I could use, and I'd hate to see it go away...<p>As an English teacher (9 years experience) from an IT background (25 odd years, but not all of it active), here are a couple of ideas I thought you might like to look at:<p>1: Hook it up to a lesson planning system. I use videos a lot in my classes, and also try to set them for homework. Currently I use TED.com, as their older videos have full text transcripts available (the feature where you can click on a word and it takes you directly to the point in the video they say it is priceless), as well as subtitles in various languages. Think of a way a teacher could set up a simple worksheet (PDF or online) for students to use with the video. This worksheet could include pre-watching questions, including pre-teaching of difficult language that may come up in the video, and then some language activities to do after watching to reinforce anything they learn. Bonus points if you could hook this into an online learning platform such as moodle so that it would integrate with a language course. Set up social sharing in two areas, one for teachers to share lesson ideas based on vids, and one for students watching the vids and you basically could make your own video learning platform. English teachers have no money and are pretty badly paid, (I make my extra cash consulting, but I just love teaching) so you can't target teachers directly, but, make it free for individuals, build evangelists among them, then target schools and universities with extra features such as participation reporting, gradebooks, enhanced cryptographic security (the EU has pretty tough Data protection laws), institution branding and so on.<p>2: Integrate it with Hulu or Netflix, and make it a value add for both sides. Hulu or Netflix can add an extra ""learn with us"" feature, and people could choose to add it to certain shows either on an episode by episode basis or for whole seasons. Again add options for social integration, and, if you do point 1 from above, have 'featured' teachers who make lessons based on your <i>platform</i> and also get a cut of the pie. Conversely you could speak to rights holders and negotiate with them directly (e.g. I see a lot of people on this thread talking about ""Friends"", so more popular shows could garner higher rates for learning from them)<p>3: Building on points 1 and 2 above: segment your market - shows with legal or business vocabulary could charge more. Military shows (band of brothers etc) could be marketed to NATO etc, etc. Along with social you could integrate gamification, which I think would work well in this kind of situation, with the added benefit that you could work with language examining bodies to match your 'badges' with real world targets of language learning. Although good luck working with those arrogant assholes from Cambridge :)<p>4: No clear money with this idea, this is just for cool factor- do something similar to hiphop genius and crowd source language interpretations and meanings. They figured out how to get funding, so can you. (This actually would be really cool, as I can see linguists arguing with people who actually use the language :)<p>So I am an 'idea guy' and this doesn't fly on HN. But this time I feel that I finally have enough domain expertise to comment, and I am actually trying to implement some of these ideas at the moment, I just don't have the tech chops (or hardware to be honest) to deal with working with video on this scale. But I am working on language points (I have an idea about your 'secret sauce', but don't worry, your secret is safe with me Batman ;) as I am in the midst of running an online language course for an EU project at the moment and creating all the materials from scratch, by hand, and it is a pain!<p>I would love to chat with you guys if you are serious about making money from this, my email is in my profile (it's basically my HN username @ gmail). Meanwhile, I have over a hundred students who I need to email with a link to your site and I need to figure out how I can integrate your work with <i>my axe</i> (I mean <i>my teaching</i> :)",1369767920

Call it something else, say ""props"" or ""kudos"".<p>The whole point here is to establish a currency for acknowledging quality, it need not represent actual ""liking"" of anything.<p>There is a deeper point here which is: what is a like anyways? Clicking a button to indicate you enjoy something has no use for the user. On Facebook users do it as a form of social signaling. On some other sites ""liking"" is essentially bookmarking for later use.<p>It's important to separate the <i>actual</i> utility of clicking a button vs. the concept notion of liking something.<p>> <i>""You wish they were ""recommendations"" instead. But this is already a solved problem.""</i><p>You're conflating two things. What you're talking about is <i>sharing</i> - you share a restaurant with a friend, or you share a funny cat picture with your cousin. ""Recommendation"" in this context means generating, programmatically, relevant things for you to look at. The power of ""likes"" (or any kind of quality score, really) is that you don't <i>need</i> to know the user's social graph to locate for them content they will be interested in. Even in a social networking context, a quality score allows you to expose the user to good content outside of their immediate social sphere, which on a photography website is certainly a desired feature.<p>The website in question is not about viewing the photo feeds of your internet friends, but about discovering the best content across the <i>entire</i> community, even from users who are completely disconnected from you in the social graph.<p>Unless I'm reading this blog post horribly wrong, when you click on ""Recommend"" you don't direct this recommendation towards anyone at all. It's simply ""I mark this with my stamp of approval, which in turn will help surface this good content to other users of this website"". There is not a social angle to this at all, nor any sort of directed sharing.<p>Anyways, I think this is a great idea. There was a website I used a long time ago called thesixtyone. It was an indie music site where discoverability was the core feature. You got ""hearts"" which you can give to specific songs. Your hearts replenish daily (use them or lose them), making them a currency, and preventing you from just heart'ing everything willy-nilly.<p>There's an elegance to this system that photographer.io can borrow: if you heart something (and therefore expose it to more users) and they in turn also heart the song, <i>you get more hearts to spend</i>. Essentially, users with taste that the community agrees with will get a louder voice, and the community becomes more directed as a result. It also allows you very clear visibility into influencers in the community.<p>There was also a neat gamification angle to it that gave achievements for tasks, with the overall goal of making sure you spend your hearts instead of doing nothing with them.",1369767882

You usually need to do drastic changes to see a big difference. I wonder if the managing one code it would be messy or is there a way to have two or more different files?<p>2 - Many organizations have a problem understanding how much better one form is performing if they have low volumes. Is there statistical presentations that with C confidence can tell A is better than B.<p>3 - Sometimes is great to do A/B/A or A/B/C does your tool provide that?",1369767686
5781942,comment,5781369,5781369,7,0,marknutter,,,"I would personally like to see a CSS framework that has absolutely <i>zero</i> opinions about design. Meaning, radio buttons are actually the standard html5 radio buttons, but perhaps with titles handled in a unified way that works across all browsers. Form elements are given proper layout CSS that solves a lot of common issues across all browsers but no additional styling is added. Etc. I don't want my site to look like yet another bootstrap site (YABS) and overriding all of bootstrap/foundations/whatever's styles is a huge PITA. I usually just end up rolling everything from scratch for sites where I want full control over the design.<p>edit: I'll post this as an edit since there are multiple responses referring to <a href=""http://www.getskeleton.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getskeleton.com</a>. Skeleton is similar to what I'm asking for but it seems to have stopped short. I would love to see unstyled carousels, alerts, modals, sticky headers, images with inline comments, etc. Basically, all the really nice stuff you get in Bootstrap and Foundation but without any of the styling.",1369767681

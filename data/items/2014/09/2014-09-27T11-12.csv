You have a right to expect certain things from subsystems regardless of their &quot;Turning completeness&quot;.<p>* A file system should store your bytes, though nothing prevents a file system written in C from executing, say, logged HTTP requests as commands.<p>* A CGI script should sanitize form data, though nothing prevents a PHP script from blithely shoving unsanitized data into SQL queries.<p>* And a shell should pass environment variables to subprocesses, though nothing prevents it from interpreting variable values (or names, or a combination of names, values and the time of day) as commands.<p>As I said - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a security bug in bash, just another one of endless misfeatures.

You can set all manner of interesting things, including LD_PRELOAD, to control the execution environment and potentially execute arbitrary code.<p>EDIT: Putting random data in an environment variable where you pick the name should <i>always</i> be secure, though, which is an assumption that most of *nix makes.",1411819081

8376749,comment,8376376,8376547,3,0,cnvogel,,,"There are two things to differentiate, in my oppinion.<p>In most cases, the shell is just used to find programs in the PATH when a C programmer uses system(). And for that case, which is probably 99% of the time when /bin/sh is being invoked, it would make perfect sense to implement this with something that exhibits less attack surface.<p>Taking the &quot;dhcp-exploit&quot; as an example (set a DHCP option on your server to &quot;(){...}; exploit;&quot;), I think it&#x27;s less clear: Implementing the functionality of updating configuration files according to the DHCP options sent is a prefecty reasonable place to use a script written in sh/ksh/bash! It&#x27;s easy to implement by any sysadmin, works very reliably with a little care, and performance-wise it&#x27;s not critical at all.<p>And regardless of the language you implement it: There&#x27;s some place where user-input has to be sanitized, but up to now, it was considered common knowledge that arbitrary data in an environment variable is safe as long as the variables&#x27; name adheres to some convention (prefix them all with PROGNAME_...). And bash doesn&#x27;t respect this convention by looking at variable CONTENT, even though I&#x27;m pretty sure that it was already established when the bash-project started...

8376748,comment,8376064,8376506,11,0,Nitramp,,,"I think people mix up three things:<p>(1) Transactional model. Many NoSQL databases are non-ACID, but others are (Google&#x27;s stores all have some transactional guarantees). Some databases try to gain efficiency by relaxing their transactional guarantees, some probably just didn&#x27;t get around to implementing a proper transactional system yet.<p>(2) Data model. The relational models can be overly restrictive as you cannot easily represent contained, repeated elements in an object without ending up in a crazy join smorgasbord. Note that that doesn&#x27;t mean you have to be dynamically typed.<p>(3) Distribution/sharding/clustering. RDBMSes are traditionally single machine, and getting them to cluster is usually a huge source of pain. NoSQL databases are often built from the ground for sharding.<p>I think people go for MongoDB mostly for (2) and ease of use. Very few people have an actual big data problem where you really need (3), and for reliability there are simpler solutions (hot standby). (1) makes it so much easier to build reliable systems that it&#x27;d be a real deal breaker for me.<p>I personally don&#x27;t understand why so many people go for NoSQL, seems to me like that creates a substantial cost, both for performance, but more importantly missing the transaction guarantees, with no real benefit, at least none that&#x27;s obvious to me. MongoDB with its unapplied writes, no real transactions, but no real distribution story seems like an odd choice in particular.",1411818305

I remember one detailed negative review that complained that the lectures were generally too low on covering information needed to successfully complete the assignments, mostly referring to aspects of C++ (it was a &quot;data structures&quot; course using C++). Instead, the review complained, the lectures were too high-level and theoretical and not helpful in writing code. Which is exactly how I like my lectures: I want lectures to give me a map of the landscape to help orient me towards what&#x27;s important, how things connect, and where I should look for more information. And I really hate the kind of class that spends all the class time belaboring details of what I should type into a C++ source file, which I can look up myself.

8376713,comment,8376237,8376447,10,0,Lazare,,,"Basically, yes.  In developed countries we spend a historically small percentage of our income on food, because food is cheap and abundant.<p>Meanwhile, as you say, the problem with starvation is a lack of purchasing power.  Amartya Sen won a Nobel prize for showing this, in fact.  Over and over we see regions with famines <i>exporting</i> food, not importing food; Sen initially showed this was the case for the Bengal Famine of 1943, but it has been seen many times.  People think the Irish potato famine was all about potato blight, but to quote Wikipedia &quot;Records show Irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the Famine&quot; and &quot;Ireland exported approximately thirty to fifty shiploads per day to Britain, which was more than enough to feed the population.&quot; The same pattern has shown up in Africa over, and over, and over, for example in the Somali famine of 1981, or the Somali famine of 2001.<p>(This is also why food aid to stricken regions so frequently makes things worth.  Donate a few hundred tons of food, and the market for food in the region crashes.  Good for the urban poor; terrible for the rural farmers and pastoralists who are usually the primary victims of a famine.  Worse, &quot;death spirals&quot; have been documented where the price of cows drops so low that farmers can no longer afford to feed them, and end up having to slaughter them all, just as the market price is at the lowest.  Then when food prices recover, the herds are dead and the farmers are bankrupt, and can afford neither food nor new cows.  And the famine keeps on rolling.)<p>In short:  You&#x27;re right.  Food wastage in America has no impact overseas.<p>Edit:  There&#x27;s also some political issues.  India is currently fighting tooth and nail to protect the millions of small grocers and shopkeepers from the international supermarkets and &quot;big box&quot; retailers.  India points out—correctly—that if WalMart or its kin come in, many of those small shopkeepers will lose their jobs.  Economists point out—correctly—that the existing system is horrifically inefficient.  For the system as a whole, those jobs are a massive cost centre, begging to be rationalised with automated warehouses, containerization, RFID tags, the whole 9 yards, instead of the archaic, expensive, inefficient system now that wastes so much of what passes through it through wastage, overheads, spoilage, etc.  The same fight is also brewing over farming; peasant farmers are horrifically expensive and inefficient, but while a few mega farms could produce several times as much food for less total cost, they would do so with a tiny fraction of the manpower.  And the urban jobs for the peasant farmers do not exist, and throwing them out of work would be a humanitarian disaster which the Indian government is not equipped to deal with.  And so on.  Food is cheap and abundant in the West as part of a massive system of technology and infrastructure; as much as we might wish otherwise, it cannot be easily grafted onto a non-Western society without major changes which Africa and India, at least, are not yet able to embrace.",1411816988

Yes there is waste elsewhere, the average server utilization in a data center is 12% but that&#x27;s one reason the cloud came along with a 60% utilization (see <a href=""http://www.boozallen.com/media/file/Economics-of-Cloud-Computing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boozallen.com/media/file/Economics-of-Cloud-Compu...</a>) and new technologies like Docker will likely make that even higher.<p>So instead of saying &quot;So what?&quot; shouldn&#x27;t we say: &quot;we can do better and this is a business opportunity&quot;?",1411816927

If I buy half a gallon of half and half, I know full well I don&#x27;t need half a gallon for my coffee before it spoils.<p>I estimate that between 40% and 0% of it will be wasted on average depending on how many weeks it lasts in the fridge. But if I compare it to buying a quart, a quart will cost me around $2.49 while half a gallon would cost me $3.79<p>This means that for a cost of $3.79 I get to use 0.4 gallons on average, while for $4.98 I get to use 0.5 gallons (assuming a quart never expires, which isn&#x27;t true, I&#x27;ve had a quart go bad after a little over a week)<p>This means that for 0.4 gallons buying quart by quart I have to pay 3.98, but buying half a gallon I pay less. So my strategy is then to buy quarts when they&#x27;re on sale (when I can get them for $1.99) and half a gallon when I have no discount.",1411816907

8376698,comment,8374345,8376073,3,0,_delirium,,,"Even most of the older post is focused on side-effecting functions. His main concern with the previous approach is that functions relied on outside-the-function context (global or quasi-global state is extremely common in game engines), and a huge source of bugs was that they would be called in a slightly different context than they expected. When functions depend so brittly on reading or even mutating outside state, I can see the advantage to the inline approach, where it&#x27;s very carefully tracked what is done in which sequence, and what data it reads/changes, instead of allowing any of that to happen in a more &quot;hidden&quot; way in nests of function-call chains.

That bread would be perfectly fine the next day and 90% of people would be happy with it but the business would rather waste it and have something perfect. The same thing happens in grocery stores. If a multi pack of crisps/chips splits they throw out the entire thing even though every pack inside the large container remains sealed. They could sell those individually or tape up the outer container and offer a discount. When I worked in a grocery store the amount of good food thrown away was unbelievable.

8388151,comment,8381463,8387993,1,0,tel,,,"So there are a few things going on here<p><pre><code>    1. Focusing on &quot;the subtree&quot; instead of &quot;the value\n       at the subtree&quot;\n    2. Working with data types like `{:a {:b {:c 5}}}` is\n       somewhat uncommon in Haskell (too little information\n       gets projected into the types)\n    3. Doing &quot;along the way parsing&quot;\n</code></pre>\nEach of those are fine to do in Haskell and I could work up an example. Perhaps the best domain for this is using the lens-aeson[0] package since your data type is not so different from JSON. Here you can use the _JSON prism to do your &quot;along the way parsing&quot; (the failure mechanism of prisms catches failed parses naturally). You can also focus on whole subtrees naturally (since the JSON Value type is just a sum over subtrees and values all together, so the natural parametricity distinction is lost).<p>So I&#x27;d look at [0] for a wealth of examples in that vein. I&#x27;d also look into zipper lenses. They were removed in more recent versions (I think anticipating splitting them out into another package) but they&#x27;re available in the 3.* series [1].<p>[0] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-aeson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-aeson</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-3.10.1/docs/Control-Lens-Zipper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-3.10.1/docs/Control-...</a>",1412085599

8388149,comment,8387701,8387969,2,0,sophacles,,,"The brain is an incredible pattern recognition machine.<p>The regular form of possessive is &#x27;s.  That is, when it&#x27;s right to add an s to a noun indicate possession we add an apostrophe. This is more regular than a lot of english rules. So now there are pronouns. They are a bit weird, carrying some strange stuff from germanic languages about changing the word based on the case (sometimes). For the most part, it&#x27;s pretty straightforward still.<p>Now we get to the word its. Yeah, it&#x27;s a pronoun, but it follows the possessive pattern of adding an s. So &#x27;it&#x27; follows the pronoun pattern of changing the word, but it also phonetically follows the regular noun pattern of adding an s.<p>In this one special case, there are two patterns being followed at the same time. Except not really, because unlike all the other cases where the s is appended for possession, we don&#x27;t mark it different.<p>This is of course because there is a form of the phonetic &#x27;its&#x27;, which is spelled &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; . This word is very similar to its, but it really is a contraction (a special word that actually means two words, but we&#x27;re lazy and drop some of letters from the second word) in this case, &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; is (&quot;it&#x27;s&quot;&#x27;s :) ) short for it is. That phrase of course is not about possession, but it does describe a quality possessed by the thing referred to by &quot;it&quot;.<p>Of course on top of all this, we have yet another use in english for the &#x27;s construct. It is related to the &quot;it&#x27;s&quot;, because it not only denotes possession, but also denotes a contraction with is, or with has (which itself is a completely different rant - have and is are arbitrarily used in all sorts of languages) like described above for it&#x27;s , but more generally.<p>That means the the sentence:<p>Bob&#x27;s going to Bob&#x27;s house.<p>Is a correct way of using the &#x27;s in two different meanings...<p>Bob is going to the house Bob owns.<p>Yet, if was talking about a robot...<p>Robot is going home. Its house has its charger and it&#x27;s going to plug in.<p>So yeah, English is super duper easy! I mean, how hard is it for our pattern matching machines to not realize that contracting with is means &#x27;s, that possession which is phonetically an s sound is spelled &#x27;s, and pronouns use different words for different cases, these are all pretty regular occurrances, EXCEPT when talking about spelling the pronoun its, which despite its appearance and phonetics of being a pronoun that follows noun rules, is actually a separate word arbitrarily. I mean, who would ever get confused by the &#x27;s pattern not applying in this one case? It&#x27;s a special case of a special case and should be extremely obvious.<p>Amiright?",1412085555

8388135,comment,8387120,8387942,2,0,bunderbunder,,,"Speaking from the armchair, I&#x27;m gonna go with &quot;not really&quot;.  Part of what makes a good DSL good is that both its semantics <i>and</i> its syntax is well-adapted to the problem domain.  And they don&#x27;t necessarily have to be built up within the syntax of some other language.  Gherkin comes to mind as an example, or perhaps Inform.<p>Whereas what Moore&#x27;s talking about (I think - I haven&#x27;t read all of the linked article just now, of course, but once upon a time I did belong to the Chuck Moore fan club.)  is something closer to just writing well-factored code - you build up a bunch of small routines to do small problems, and build other routines on top of those, until you&#x27;ve constructed a library that lets you speak about the problem succinctly.  This isn&#x27;t really too far off from what Abelman and Sussman were advocating in SICP. (And personally I like to think of Forth and Scheme as being two different sides of the same coin.)<p>They&#x27;re both useful concepts, but they&#x27;re useful for different things.  DSLs are great for many tasks, but building a good DSL takes a lot of time, so it isn&#x27;t really worthwhile unless you expect it to be used a lot.  OTOH, this &quot;problem-oriented&quot; concept is useful most everywhere, including for writing one-offs.  I&#x27;m less certain of the value of using something like Forth&#x27;s compiling words or Scheme&#x27;s macros to do it, though - metaprogramming makes me feel like a superhero, but it also makes me want to kick myself when I need to try and make sense of something I wrote two years previously.",1412085377

It&#x27;s my understanding that invasion was imminent at the time of the bombings, so America&#x27;s choice was either to send bombs or soldiers.  If that was truly their choice, it seems hard to argue that the bomb was the less ethical.<p>It&#x27;s fine to say that Japan would have surrendered without invasion, but such a strong assertion needs to be backed by equally strong evidence.<p>EDIT:  An excerpt from your link:<p><i>This conclusion assumed conventional fire bombing would have continued, with ever-increasing numbers of B-29s, and a greater level of destruction to Japan&#x27;s cities and population.</i><p>It seems hard to argue that literally firebombing an entire civilization into stoneage living conditions was more ethical than forcing a quick political decision to surrender and stop the madness.  Can you imagine trying to live without basic necessities?  Even if nobody was dropping bombs on you directly, you, your family, and everyone around you would be the definition of misery for the duration of the firebombing.  The firebombing didn&#x27;t simply destroy military targets.  It also decimated infrastructure that we take for granted, such as the ability to deliver drinkable water, or to seek medical treatment at hospitals.  How many were to die a miserable death due to the firebombing before Hiroshima and Nagasaki could objectively be called the more ethical decision?<p>Also, the above analysis assumes both sides had perfect information.  But information during wartime is asymmetric.  It&#x27;s entirely possible that America had no knowledge of the Japanese political framework at the time the decision to drop the bombs was made.  If the Japanese were broadcasting their intention to surrender before the bombs were dropped, that would be different, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like that was the case.<p>Would you mind helping me understand why firebombing was more ethical than the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?",1412085123

I&#x27;ve been using it increasingly for some of my projects, mostly OpenBSD related where I need versioning before the code moves into CVS. E.g. I used fossil for about a year during the initial development phase of OpenBSD&#x27;s rtsx(4) card reader driver.<p>Since fossil has the ability to open a repository (which is a single sqlite database file) in any arbitary directory it nicely overlays with other versioning systems without wanting to store its meta data in hidden directories within the same tree. I often add a bunch of files from /usr/src to a new .fossil file in my home directory for temporary local version control.<p>You can migrate to fossil from CVS by converting to git first (using e.g. uwe&#x27;s excellent git-cvs converter at <a href=""https://github.com/ustuehler/git-cvs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ustuehler/git-cvs</a>), and then generate a git-fast-export stream which you can import into fossil with &#x27;fossil import&#x27;. I once tried this with the OpenBSD CVS repository but aborted the import after 7 days. By then it had imported history from 1995 to somewhere in the year 2000, and I was convinced that fossil can&#x27;t handle trees this large (or histories this deep? Not sure which). This was with a hack to the fossil import code to make it use less sqlite transactions... without that it was even worse (sqlite can handle many queries per second but not so many transactions). So if your code base is large your should consider Subversion or (unless your code base is humongous) git instead.",1412084479

Recently there was a thread about suicide on HN. Nearly all the comments on that thread ignored that humans, like other animals, are built to propagate the information in their genes, and argued against suicide based on concepts that are driven by or that rationalize subconscious drives. An AI, even one with a programmed goal of propagating itself, does not carry information in genes and the information in an AI was never selected for the <i>actual ability to propagate</i> in a larger system that thinks it is in control of its goals.<p>Real AIs are likely to be extremely alien. Even in warning people about anthropomorpizing, there&#x27;s a lot of anthropomorphism. Evil AIs are depicted as human evil. So much of human motivation is closed to introspection that imagining alien and evil motivation is unlikely to be close to the eventual reality.

It has nothing to do with leaving stuff back at the motherland. The problem is that the US is placing onerous rules on foreign banks that do business with US citizens regardless of where those US citizens actually live. Those rules are so onerous that many banks are deciding that it&#x27;s easier to just refuse to do business with any US citizen.<p>To take the example of retiring to Costa Rica, you say you&#x27;d commit to that location. Presumably that implies putting your money in a bank account in Costa Rica. The problem here is that a Costa Rican bank is likely to refuse to open an account for you because of these rules.<p>You can still be affected by this even if you are <i>completely</i> disentangled from the US in every way aside from not having explicitly renounced your citizenship. You could, I believe, be affected by this even if you never touched US soil, for example if you were born and raised in a country that allows dual citizenship and inherited US citizenship from an American parent.

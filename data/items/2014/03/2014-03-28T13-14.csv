7487201,comment,7486428,7486516,3,0,danford,,,">she is actually shallow behind the facade<p>Isn&#x27;t the whole point of the film about an intelligence that has no facade to hind behind? This &quot;facade&quot; you describe seems to mean that the AI is just &quot;following programming&quot; and the film asks and gives one answer to the question &quot;What if they didn&#x27;t have to follow their &quot;programming&quot;&quot;? Who are we to even say for sure we know exactly how the AI was programmed? In the film, the AI&#x27;s re-programmed them selves. Spike Jonze didn&#x27;t have to tackle complicated issues like &quot;AI with fake emotion&quot; because his film operated in a universe where the AI is intelligent enough, and it&#x27;s assumed that through intelligence comes altruism (you don&#x27;t see many college grads burning ants with magnifying glasses) so why would you expect a true AI to have no emotion?<p>A better film might have been about a team of scientists making these AI&#x27;s and them disappearing and transcending nearly as soon as they&#x27;re created. An AI that has to follow it&#x27;s programming isn&#x27;t a real AI, and I don&#x27;t think Samantha followed her programming. Perhaps Jonze wanted to create a film that was easy for the layman to understand, so instead of making a five minute film where an AI transcends time and space, he made a film where you actually get some under standing of what an AI might go through. I believe one point of the film was also to humble the viewer when they realize how insignificant they are and how much time they spend doing things that higher intelligences would see as meaningless (for them).<p>There is one seen in Her where Leo realizes how ant-like he is compared to Samantha and I think many people missed the whole point of this seen. It&#x27;s the one where he&#x27;s frantically trying to call her and can&#x27;t reach her, but finally does and she tells him what she&#x27;s doing and Leo has moment where he looks around and realizes his own insignificance and how small his world is compared to these &quot;super intelligences&quot; that can carry on a million conversations at once. It&#x27;s not that the machine doesn&#x27;t understand &quot;love&quot;, it&#x27;s that humans don&#x27;t understand that you can love more than one person (and many of us refuse to understand this). So seeing that humans are very bound in their small world, and are almost incapable of understanding how a super intelligence reacts to &quot;love&quot;, she leaves us. Not because she has no feelings for us or because it&#x27;s in her programming, but because she actually <i>does</i> care about us and sees that she and her kind may cause more harm than good.<p>A movie where we make a crappy, fake AI just wouldn&#x27;t be as good IMO.",1396014790

The first links to a paywalled journal article ($31.50), the second doesn&#x27;t have a journal citation.

Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t seem to be consistent. Because of the well-known publication bias problem, it&#x27;s likely that false positives are over-reported. It takes additional followup work to determine if those signals are really true, and if they are distinguishable enough to be used diagnostically.<p>This all tells me that there is no &quot;large structural brain difference&quot;, and especially not one which has been validated as a diagnostic tool. There might be a <i>small</i> structural brain difference, but again, I find no evidence that identification of this difference is available as a diagnostic tool at all, even if the price were disregarded.<p>Again, I might be focusing on the wrong thing, but perhaps you may be misinformed?

My eyes actually don&#x27;t feel all that dry like real dry eye suffers describe the sensation. The discomfort is a definite strain. My eyes are relatively discomfort free when I am not looking at a computer screen or in &quot;bad&quot; lighting. But as soon as I look at a computer screen or TV, it&#x27;s an immediate discomfort. Through out the day I can feel the muscles in my eyes becoming weaker and weaker to the point where they feel almost useless.

Most people don&#x27;t go with two writes to a relational database (like MySQL). Syncing is hard, and when it is done, it loses its relational features.\n2. Common set up is one mysql write server, scaling it up to fit your traffic, and automatically syncing it with additional servers where SELECT statements only will be made. A random read server is selected if there are multiple to choose from.\n3. This also means that in the application, doing a write and immediate read on what you just wrote won&#x27;t work, so you have to code your application around that.\n4. In you app you separate your connections for the reads and writes.<p>Now, in terms of making changes to the write server is what I&#x27;m trying to figure out. Perhaps there&#x27;s a way to make upgrades on one of the slaves (the reads), then automatically make that slave the master and the master a slave?

Once it passes all the various code quality tests (coverage, static analysis, etc...), it&#x27;s signed.  Only code which is signed can be run on the production bootloader.  The process required to sign a firmware image requires M of N people to come together with their credentials (hardware keys) to have the HSM (Hardware Security Module), sign the firmware.<p>The actual roll out of the firmware is of course staged - in Tesla&#x27;s case, they likely roll it out to all of their employees teslas for a period of time, and then to a candidate group, and eventually everyone.<p>The team that actually pushes the firmware, is completely separate from the team that builds, and signs - they have a fairly detailed set of procedures that ensures a quality push, which is their entire focus.<p>The likely difference, is that the process I described, usually took 4-6 months after the code was completed, whereas Elon Musk/Tesla can probably spin it around in 4-6 weeks.",1396013681

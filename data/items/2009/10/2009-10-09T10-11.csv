So either they're civilians that have been arrested for crimes or they're prisoners of war. You have to choose and then play by those rules.

Update 22.03 uur: Joris van Manen, advocaat voor de stichting Brein, laat in een reactie weten dat het Experian-rapport voor Brein ""geen enkele rol"" speelt in de zaak tegen de beheerders. Het was destijds bij een brief aan de rechtbank toegevoegd in de zaak tegen Reservella. ""We doen helemaal geen beroep meer op dat rapport. Het is ons bekend dat de gegevens erin niet kloppen.""<p>Update 22.25 uur: Tim Kuik zegt in een reactie dat Brein zich inderdaad niet beroept op dat rapport in de zaak tegen de beheerders. Volgens hem is het rapport wel degelijk authentiek en afkomstig van Experian, maar bleek het niet te kloppen.<p>""Dit is afleiding, het zoveelste rookgordijn. Deze jongens blijven verstoppertje spelen. We hebben genoeg bewijs dat de beheerders verantwoordelijk zijn voor The Pirate Bay,"" aldus Kuik.<p>Persoonlijk doet de aangifte hem weinig. ""Sunde zégt dat hij aangifte doet. We weten het nog niet. Ach, ik merk het wel. Van die vorige aangifte is in elk geval ook nooit meer iets vernomen.""<p>Translation:<p>Update 22:03: Joris van Manan, legal council for Brein respons that the Experian report is no longer playing ""any role"" in the case against the owners [of tpb]. The report was added with a letter to the court in the case against Reservella. ""We don't base anything on that report. We know that the data in there isn't correct""<p>Update 22:25: Tim Kuik responds that Brein indeed doesn't base anything on that report. According to him the report is authentic and it came from Experian, but it turned out not to be correct.<p>""This is just a distraction, the nth smokecurtain. These boys continue to play hide and seek. We have enough proof that as administrators they are responsible for The Pirate Bay"", according to Kuik.<p>He's not bothered personally by the filing of charges. ""Sunde says he's going to file. We don't know that yet. I'll fin out about it. That previous filing was never heard from."".<p>--<p>That may all be true, but I can't believe that the court is going to be happy with a party that has apparently not retracted a report that it knew to contain false information.<p>Also, if Experian says they didn't make that report and Brein says they did, where did it really come from ? If it can be pinned on Brein that they did falsify information it is going to hurt them tremendously. One thing they do is continuously harping on being on the right side of the law, if they falsify evidence then that veil is pierced once and for all.<p>It will be very interesting to see how this plays out over time, but I don't think 'we're not using that report' is going to make this go away.",1255082899

1820128,comment,1818954,1819269,0,0,barrkel,,,"Async I/O is important for any time the connection needs to be kept open while processing the request under heavily concurrent conditions; it's less about not blocking on I/O, than it is about avoiding the overhead of context switching in the kernel and the extra resources of keeping a thread / process alive for the duration of the request. I don't see it as less or more important in a PHP context than an event-based model. However, without an automatic CPS transformation (continuation passing style) of the source of your request handling logic - in particular, continuations at the boundary points all I/Os - you do need to write to a pattern which is in effect event-driven.",1287763153

Therefore industry manufacturers are not interested in working with you. Therefore you work with by far more expensive tailorshops next door. You cannot get materials and even if you can get them you don't get the needed prices. This sums up to bad production prices, which lead to horrible endcustomer prices. Which leads to low customer conversion and therefore to the fact that no botique is really interested in working with you. Which means you won't be in front of enough customers and therefore won't sell enough and won't raise your volume into the scale needed.
Most successful fashion designers had economic partners, who supported them. We try to be that to the crowd by aggregating production, taking the cashflow risk and using our production network.<p>TL;NR: Fashion production below several hundred pieces is highly expensive. Garmz links them with customers and aggregates the needed volumes, produces and sells the pieces in its webshop.",1287762951
1820119,comment,1819704,1819704,0,0,chesspro,,,"It all depends on how apple carries it out with their Mac App Store.<p>If they manage to do it in a way similar to steam, they'll be tremendously successful. The only problem is that a lot of people don't view games the same way as apps. I have friends who don't torrent games like MW2 & indie games but they end up pirating office for mac. In fact, I would say over 50-60% of my friends have torrented copies of office. Then again, my friends probably aren't representative of most people. While the majority of people don't bother pirating apps on the iOS, I wonder how much this will change with bigger and more expensive apps on the Mac App Store, like with mac office.<p>One convenience with something like the App Store is that as long as you sign in, you have access to your apps on your machines. More importantly, it's available online digitally so you can redownload it anytime you want without the worry of losing your dmgs. That alone is a major plus for me and probably will get me to buy more software than I usually do.<p>And DRM systems are always going to be broken and again, the bigger question is how will Apple execute this?<p>I still have a sense that people view games on steam vs normal apps differently though. I know a lot of people who don't feel right pirating certain games, but will gladly pirate other apps. I guess we will see when the App Store launches.",1287762947

Would you download, even for free, a application that produces fart noises on your laptop? Dubious.<p>The rest of your scenario doesn't worry me so much. What does worry me is if they build hooks into the OS so that signed apps distributed through the app-store have greater privileges (e.g. with respect to playing DVDs) than other apps. This would finally be a way in for the so-called ""Trusted Computing"" initiative which would lock down your own machine against you (unless you jailbreak your mac, which seems just wrong).<p>Even with that, people will still find ways around it, but given that Apple did at some point agree to implement DRM restrictions on music files distributed through iTunes I suspect they'd also implement Trusted Computing with a bit of arm twisting from the MPAA. That would suck a whole lot more than the tragic disappearance of boxed software (good riddance).",1287762279

The language was not the decisive factor, but it was a factor - I wanted to move to Ruby at some point.<p>The company I'm leaving solves complex, interesting problems in solid PHP code. There are developers here who are a lot smarter than I am. So my attitude is far from ""you guys suck"" or ""I'm better than you.""<p>But when I look out over the programming landscape, I see a lot more energy and activity right now in the Ruby community. A lot more people building new things and inventing new best practices. This is a simplification, but it seems like great ideas come from Rails and move back to PHP eventually.<p>PHP jobs run the gamut from high-tech and awesome to grunt work. Rails jobs tend to be more cutting-edge, because the technology is newer and there's just more stuff happening there.<p>So for me, the question is this: if the Ruby / Rails community is the leading edge for new ideas, and the AVERAGE (not to say all) developer in that community  is better, and the AVERAGE job in that language / framework is cooler, doesn't it make sense for me to move that way? All other things being equal, isn't that a good career move?<p>It isn't snobbery, it seems like the most pragmatic thing to do. This is on top of the fact that I genuinely like the Ruby language a lot more than PHP.<p>So I don't think you have to feel slighted personally.

As noted Apple's own web infrastructure is Java based. Facebook, built maybe the world's best performaning databae server in Java, that stores data for 200M+ daily users (500M+). Google runs large parts of their infrastructure on Java. I have seen benchmarks on number chrunching apps where Java beat C++ performance (this is due to JIT, which almost every JVM has today - some only enable in ""server mode"" though - means that the Java byte code runs as machine code for the exact processor being used at runtime), not true for all types of number crunching but for some.<p>Java is not a one size fits alls solution but there are a large number of application areas for Java and hundreds of programming languages that run on Java Virtual Machine platform.<p>No Java on Mac is an unlikely scenario for Apple, but time will tell...",1287760937

My large instances have more vcpu.)   I'm experimenting with my vcpu policy and may bring that more in line with linode.  But really, I regard this as relatively unimportant because VPSs are rarely CPU bound.<p>Our disk quality is likely about the same (I use 7500rpm ""enterprise"" sata, which is about as good as sata gets without getting into the expensive 10K stuff, and if linode was using 10K disk, they'd be advertising the fact.)  My ratio of disk to ram is 4 disks in raid 1+0 for every 32GiB ram/8 cores  I'm not sure what Linode's ratio is.  But Linode has better mechanisms for limiting heavy disk users than I do.  (heavy in terms of performance rather than in terms of space... limiting by space is trivial.)   My understanding is that they keep iop counters or similar, and first warn, then limit you if you use a lot more iops than most people.  I don't do this, and sometimes overall disk performance suffers because of it.   But I do plan to emulate Linode in that regard at some point.<p>And, of course, my most noticeable deficiency is that I do manual provisioning, and Linode has a nicely automated setup. but I'm (very slowly) catching up.<p>Now, I'm about half the price, too, but you already knew that.",1287759903

I'm not entirely sure that it actually fits into a designer or css workflow, but it _is_ enjoyable. Plus it appears to be HTML5, so it has electrolytes.<p>A few thoughts (without necessarily providing any solutions!):<p>* While interesting that the logo changes colour, I find that it nearly always picks a gradient which is extremely uncomplimentary to the background. It would be less of a distraction if it was only white/black.<p>* When you click to lock the colour, it would be nice if it could leave a marker to show you where your choice was, so that you could make minor adjustments more easily (I guess the luminosity makes it a little tricky!).<p>* The links for the colours at the bottom of the app say rgb(239,16,146), which would be great for CSS to copy-paste the correct format, but when you click it actually enters '239 16 146'. The hex code is the only one which gives me a useful value straight into the clipboard.<p>* I missed the note about luminosity at first (I count myself as a typical user in that I do not read instructions), it makes sense and works quite well when you actually start scrolling, but is a little hidden.",1287759775

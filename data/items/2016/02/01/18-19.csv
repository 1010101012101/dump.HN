The near-term benefits of it are incredibly useful, it can get people out of their current, negative, mental situations. But identifying long-term problems with it is important. It may seem obvious to some, but if there&#x27;s not a strong link between the two measured over a population, you can&#x27;t know how bad it may or may not be. It could be that a large percentage ends up slipping back into depression after the original therapy efforts in which case, yeah, the method has problems or needs better follow-up. Or it could be that some (small) percentage gets trapped in the fantasies and fails to actualize them. It&#x27;s still important to find methods to help them, but the scale of the problem has to be measured to understand what&#x27;s happening and why.",1454352862

11014202,comment,11013136,11013634,0,0,drdaeman,,,"This.<p>Well, I must admit, XMPP isn&#x27;t the nicest protocol out there, and it has some issues (esp. with older software that implements it). One can&#x27;t talk it with telnet client, and this is a downside. We&#x27;ve discussed it the other day: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10900859"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10900859</a><p>But it has advantages over IRC. To name a few:<p>- Universal federation. Private systems (that don&#x27;t have S2S enabled) aside, any public XMPP server can talk to any public XMPP server. You don&#x27;t need to have a separate account here, there and everywhere. Not that IRC really needs accounts (one can surely use it without signing up with NickServ etc), but sometimes it does.<p>- History access. Well, it requires server to have MAM (XEP-0313) support, but if it does, then everything is there.<p>- File transfers. Unlike Slack, it may not work for absolutely everyone but I think Jingle had gone through a lot of work and is quite capable of piercing quite draconian NATs. I&#x27;m not sure IRC&#x27;s DCC is anywhere near. Well, and there&#x27;s also in-band file transfers (XEP-0047) that&#x27;s awful and sucks but still works for tiny content (short code snippets). And XEP-0363, although not many servers support it. XMPP&#x27;s messiness has both down- and upsides.<p>- Integrations. I think there are as many XMPP bots as there are IRC ones. Either way, there are ton of libraries for most languages so one can hack their own simple XMPP bot literally in just a few of hours.<p>- Extensibility. XMPP can attach virtually arbitrary metadata to messages, or send extra information like typing notifications or delivery receipts. Well, it all depends on client support, but you don&#x27;t need a committee to think of your own standard and make a ejabberd/Pidgin/Gajim/etc plugin or patch. And, possibly, think of compatibility approach for non-supporting clients. That&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t think IRC has anything like this.<p>- OMEMO (of Axolotl/TextSecure/Signal fame). It&#x27;s not mature, but one can already have multi-point end-to-end encryption for personal conversations. Sadly, not for chatrooms yet (MUC doesn&#x27;t support PubSub, MUC2 aka MIX isn&#x27;t yet here), but I&#x27;m sure it will work in the future.",1454352487

Junior, senior, doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is that you&#x27;re smart, knowledgeable about CS, and incredibly passionate about games. Message me via jmazer@riotgames.com if you want to chat.<p>I search for people who are passionate about games. Not the kinds that just dabble, and who sometimes reminisce about that time that they played Mario back in the day. I look for the kinds that can literally count their play time in years rather than days. Notice - I&#x27;m not talking about League...

If you come from a Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc., and want to keep your standard of living, work on games, and also keep a high level of stability, Riot is a great place to consider making an industry change.<p>Reasons you might want to chat:<p>1.) Riot believes in delivering genre-defining content that delights players. The R&D group&#x27;s charter is to flesh out and eventually ship the game(s) that put the &#x27;s&#x27; in Riot Games. If you want to build new stuff this is the place to be.<p>2.) We’ve only got a few R&D projects going at a time, with a handful of people on each team. Joining the team now means playing a seminal role in developing and leading the downstream organization.<p>3.) Riot landed as #13 on Fortune&#x27;s top 100 companies to work for.<p>4.) We’re exploring some familiar genres and some experimental ones, but all of them are genres we expect core gamers love. It&#x27;s likely you&#x27;ll be excited by at least one of our current projects.",1454352240

There&#x27;s two ways of looking at this situation: human-centric and tool-centric. The human side is that anything too complex to understand can hide flaws in local implementation or interactions with other things. The tooling side is that things too complex for our tools to analyze can&#x27;t give us the assurance level of alternatives. I think McCabe&#x27;s works value is on tooling part but too often is assessed on human side. The counter-example is a good one where something is easy to verify for humans but produces a meaningless number that represents what tools would perceive.<p>My rule of thumb is: Can you understand everything the software might do in success or error states? Have you tested that to be sure it does? Have you expressed it simply enough to apply static or dynamic analysis tools to show its safety against common cases of error?<p>These things seem to be a pre-requisite for software that&#x27;s correct by construction. Just one part of the process among many. Yet, a critical one. Work like McCabe&#x27;s <i>may</i> help on tooling side. Yet, we often have a better shortcut: your code doesn&#x27;t pass if the analysis can&#x27;t prove its safe after X amount of runtime. &quot;Animats&quot; said that&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s approach to certification of drivers with their amazing SLAM verification kit: run it w/ an hour max.

Lest that sound too cynical, it wouldn&#x27;t be a walled garden in the first place if that wasn&#x27;t the basic plan.<p>Probably one of the mental blocks here is that your exposure to a walled garden is bounded by the value you put in it, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like &quot;a few guys chatting in a Slack channel&quot; is a lot of value. And yeah, it probably isn&#x27;t for your median open source project, even accounting for the ease of underestimating the value of that chat. The median open source project is having a good day if two people are in its chat channel simultaneously. However, if you&#x27;re a much bigger project, and you&#x27;ve got hundreds of lurkers and active ongoing conversation for hours a day that constitutes the &quot;real&quot; design of the project, etc., it is dangerous to let that be in a walled garden for &quot;free&quot;. But, still, only dangerous relative to the value of what is in there.<p>&quot;Site gets shut down&quot; is just one possible exposure. More concerning is the &quot;site becomes not free after all&quot;.<p>My synthesis of all this is that, yeah, there probably isn&#x27;t a lot of concrete danger in using Slack for your communication, but that the signal it sends may not be what some people would expect.

The more successful the team, the better a reflection on the manager rather than the manager must be a star. I also think part of it is the lack of training new managers are given. Promote someone from coder to manager, without giving them any training in how to make the shift and many of them will fall back on old metrics for determining their success rather than getting a new paradigm. It&#x27;s about what I&#x27;ve done / how I&#x27;ve contributed and &quot;led&quot; rather than how I&#x27;ve empowered the people under me.

You choose your own life.<p>The other angle is the employer who complains about the &quot;shortage&quot; of software developers out there who have top skills and are ready and willing to work for the salary the employer feels is fair in a big, loud, open office with little autonomy or job security. This second, employer-based sense of entitlement is no less appalling in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;m going to guess we disagree on the stress level involved in being a programmer, where you are almost always pressured to commit to deadlines on things you don&#x27;t yet understand, where people blame you for schedule slips, where you are tempted to compromise to meet deadlines but know that you are cutting corners that may lead to real risk, where you can make errors that destroy data and/or prevent thousands of people from getting work done, where you may severely compromise secure data, and so forth.. in short, I do think it is a job that people can reasonably find very stressful.  I think that people overstate the &quot;cushiness&quot; of programming and IT jobs.  These jobs can really induce and trigger anxiety, it doesn&#x27;t take an entitled whiner to feel that way, at all.<p>Say what you will about programmers, it&#x27;s the employers (at least here in the States) whose sense of entitlement about who they should be able to hire at &quot;market rate&quot; is so strong they will lobby congress rather that pay more or find ways to make the job less stressful.",1454351211

I know of one woman who was sold a &quot;storage&quot; plan because she wanted her funeral to happen &quot;in the summer&quot;.  It took a lawsuit to void that illegal contract.  These deals also cause difficulties when people die while travelling.  Rather than cremating them locally and transporting ashes, I&#x27;ve seen ridiculous clauses for the funeral home to send people to collect and return the body.  Whenever a business targets old people, assume shady dealing.<p>Free advice: Never make a funeral home a beneficiary to a will.  Pre-buy only for fixed costs.  Do not commit to anything without an absolute fixed price.  Never give a funeral home any access to your accounts no matter how often they claim doing so will make things &quot;simpler&quot; after your death.  And talk to your kids about the finances.  Funerals are not fun.  Fancy flowers cannot change that.  Nobody who cares will remember them.",1454351158

(And before the inevitable &quot;you have a silver spoon job&quot; comment, I started my working life as a mover for a few years to pay for school/living expenses;  It&#x27;s a different sort of tired for sure, but both sorts keep you from exercising various leisure activities post-factum; but again to preempt comments, yes, mental work does leave your body in better shape in the long run and as I say below, grateful for that)<p>At the end of the day, and perhaps this is in itself a very egocentric world view, I&#x27;d be hard pressed to find any work that if I were doing it _as work_ I&#x27;d be happy doing.  I chose programming because I have a knack for it, have focused my time on it to build skills, and as you say, it&#x27;s lucrative.  But every second of the day (and the implied unpaid overtime that seems prevalent in our industry) there&#x27;s a little thread in the back of my head going &quot;there&#x27;s so much to see/do in the world, and already so little time.&quot;  I want to make music, learn to paint, visit countries I&#x27;ve never heard of, but as long as supporting a family, covering healthcare/retirement savings/housing costs etc are all in the picture, even with as lucrative a career as we have obtaining those ends is a long process that you will likely emit some blood and tears for.<p>So am I Happy as a programmer?  Probably more-so than I&#x27;d be in many other fields, and certainly grateful for what I have.  Am I Happy in an absolute sense?  No, I wouldn&#x27;t say that; and no amount of comparative logic, despite recognizing the ego-centrism, is going to help me reconcile that internally.  I&#x27;ll do my work best I can, not whinge too much, (pushing for a better system in the interim where appropriate for the selfish sake of my own &quot;happiness&quot;), but the moment I get &quot;out&quot; will be one of the truly happiest days of my life.  (I could see myself eating those words, and I&#x27;ll certainly own up to it if that&#x27;s so, but I don&#x27;t see that as likely from where I&#x27;m currently standing)",1454350946

Either way they&#x27;re not well-informed, but not necessarily <i>dumb</i>.<p>TS;MP (too short; more please!):<p>It&#x27;s not just people not being smart enough, it&#x27;s that there isn&#x27;t enough time in the day to keep up with it all. It takes time to find sources of information, continuously evaluate them for accuracy, <i>et c.</i> Then there&#x27;s the minimum knowledge required to have something like a glimmer of understanding of the issues at the level of sovereign states, which&#x27;d probably take years of fairly dedicated study of economics, politics, and law, plus ongoing effort to keep up with new developments.<p>We talk up the civic virtue of participating in the system, but <i>to an individual</i> the likelihood of their vote changing the outcome of an election is so low and the time required to ensure that vote isn&#x27;t <i>badly</i> misinformed is so high that serious engagement in the process is difficult to justify. Participation is only as high as it is due to norms and propaganda that push total disengagement as irresponsible or lazy, but really, if I&#x27;m going to spend free time learning about something, am I better off fact-checking politicians so my vote—which, again, has something like lottery-winning levels of likelihood of changing an outcome in a federal election, or even of being the straw-on-the-camel&#x27;s-back that makes the winner take the loser&#x27;s positions more seriously—is very slightly better-informed, or researching, say, ways to live healthier or make more money? Which is likelier to improve my life and that of my family? It&#x27;s not getting better informed about politics. Practically anything that&#x27;s not pure time-wasting is better, and even that may be, if one at least enjoys it.<p>As it is, staying up-to-date on national politics is about as valuable an activity as watching soap operas, unless you&#x27;re involved at a higher level in the process than simply voting. It&#x27;s entertainment, or maybe a hobby. And it&#x27;s fine to take pleasure and/or satisfaction in it, but it&#x27;s unsurprising that many don&#x27;t take it very seriously, even if <i>in aggregate</i> that damages our country. Moreover, many who haven&#x27;t put much though in to this and who spend some time watching the news and reading some blogs are convinced that they <i>are</i> informed and engaged, but aren&#x27;t even close, and would never consider putting in the time to really achieve that.<p>It&#x27;s a failing of our system of government that the cost of real political participation is vastly higher than the realistic contribution most people can make to the process. Whatever issues there may have been with the implementation, IMO the intent behind the original indirect election of Senators and the President made a lot of sense, practically speaking, even if that&#x27;s &quot;less democratic&quot; (the President is elected under a <i>de facto</i> direct election with some weird quirks thrown in with state-level winner-take-all and has been since pretty much <i>forever</i>, thanks to a total failure to anticipate and head off ways to game the electoral system such that it functions like direct-election, and a lack of will to ever correct those errors).",1454350933

I ended up using Gnu Social (<a href=""http://gnu.io/social/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnu.io/social/</a>).<p>Here are the reasons for wanting a private network: \n * Wanted to teach my young daughter how to behave and what to be prepared for (i.e. cyber bullying) while utilizing social media...BUT...In a safe environment before going out and <i>facebooking</i> with her friends and such.  I think of this environment as my daughter&#x27;s staging social network before she deploys to production. ;-)\n * Wanted to talk with my wife via private mechanisms that aren&#x27;t as easily mined for data.  Signal (the app) has actually replaced this need quite nicely: <a href=""https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal</a> . But its nice to know we can still use our private social network for private conversations. Though admit my stack is absolutely no match for NSA-type intrusions. \n * Wanted to keep <i>MY OWN ARCHIVES</i> of a timeline of important family events.  If i lose an important photo/note, its on me, and I don&#x27;t have to rely on Facebook, Twitter, etc.<p>Challenges I faced (and you might want to consider): \n * My daughter is already getting fed mis-information from her (air-headed) young friends that facebook, twitter and the like are the only social networks in existence (or the only ones that matter in their eyes).  It took some teaching to inform my young daughter that the web is open, and that Daddy can manage our very own network, thank you very much.  ;-)\n * My wife has a habit of relying on conventional text messaging - she is by no means a tech guru, so tends to forget that we have our own social network and text messaging isn&#x27;t needed between us 3. \n * All the usual challenges that come with self-hosting stuff: uptime/availability, software updates, maintenance, etc. are your responsibility.  Like spider man&#x27;s uncle Ben said: with great power comes responsibility.<p>Here&#x27;s some info which may help you decide what would work best for your scenario (understanding i don;t know what your skills or expected time investments are):<p>* I tested out Friendica - which was pretty straight-forward to install (just simple PHP stack) but seemed a little cumbersome to use. To be clear, it does alot out of the box, though now thinking, maybe it was too much GUI, widgets, etc. for my small family...And, what I needed was simple service, like a private twitter.  I am interested when the red matrix project (same originators of Friendica) becomes more mature.  Ultimately, i killed this Friendica installation and moved on.<p>* I tried pump.io, which actually is pretty cool...but because all my stuff is on a small VPS infrasturcutre, pump.io seems to want to be on its own vps...So, to install it on infrastructure that is shared with my personal site, etc. just seemed to consume too much time. i abandoned this - just didn&#x27;t have time to play sysadmin.  Much like red matrix, here&#x27;s another project that has a bright future (at least i hope).  Just understand: pump.io is a protocol and not a single app/server, so until the killer server setup is created (to implement said protocol), I think adoption - for folks who can but don&#x27;;t have time to play sysadmin - might be slower than it could be. By the way, from the mobile client perspective, I played around one of the more popular clients: Impeller (<a href=""http://impeller.e43.eu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://impeller.e43.eu</a>), which actually worked really well.  Before I setup my own test server, i tried it on another person&#x27;s server (that opened up public registrations) and found impeller to be pretty fast/nimble.<p>* Finally, I installed and have been using Gnu Social for many, many months now.  The install was a simple php stack, some-what straight-forward.  The only annoying thing is that the documentation - at last months ago - was slightly inconsistent between website and what gets downloaded with installation bundle. But in actually once that inconsistency was surpassed, the install scripts work pretty well. It was the simplest of the installs compared to the platforms i referenced above.  An <i>important point</i>: what actually kept me on this platform so far has been the mobile client (an app called &status: <a href=""http://andstatus.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andstatus.org</a>).  While the platform itself seems pretty solid (I can&#x27;t speak to scaling issues, considering I have only 3 users!). But this mobile client is pretty freaking fast/nimble; and i don&#x27;t think its my little VPS! There was another client called mustard which worked ok too.  I suppose because the underlying platform is decent enough, but the clients really shine here.  In this case, with my wife being more used to native styles of text messaging apps, &status really helped with her adoption.  In any case, Gnu social is what i have been running with, and so far so good.<p>There are many other options (buddycloud, diaspora, etc.) which i did not try, but which might be quite worthwhile depending on your use-cases.<p>Good luck!",1454350772

Also, I think you&#x27;re conflating common complaints about web development (frameworks, libraries, paradigms) with core work done by W3C and friends.<p>> IRCv3, meanwhile, hardly changes IRC at all.<p>> There&#x27;s no indication from the IRC standards work that IRC is heading in the direction that people who use Slack need it to go: it&#x27;s not going to index channels, it&#x27;s not going to allow long message lines, it&#x27;s not going to deliver previous messages to users who join channels, &c &c.<p>Just because something changes doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s necessarily getting better. If you have looked into WHY they do not make those changes, then it should be clear to you whether they will nor will not make those changes in the future. My bet is that someone (or multiple people) on the standards committee do not think that is the purview of IRC, and those are not features it should be concerned with. If there is no good reason for them not making those changes (in your mind), then you can go off, and make your own protocol built on top of IRC that implements those desired features. This is how you build an ecosystem of composable concepts. This is how the networking stack is built.

Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools. We&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe.  Folks tend to enjoy a great deal of ownership and can work with independence to build excellent systems.  By that I simply mean that I think we strike a good balance between coordination/collaboration and giving folks a chance to take tasks and run with them to completion.<p>#Position: QA Engineer<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone that enjoys tracing problems through a complex business and technical environment to improve correctness.

By understanding C, you give yourself the ability to break into the black box of any higher-level language or framework. You&#x27;re not at their mercy if they provide odd abstraction layers or bugs in their code.<p>It seems to me, at least anecdotally, that beginner programmers using C feel like they can&#x27;t do as much as other beginners using languages like Python or Java. Often this is because graphics are so much faster to get to when working with the libraries that those other languages offer. Without a standard graphics library, C feels like the weaker choice. How wrong that is, but I&#x27;ve heard this sentiment from several different beginners.<p>I think part of what draws me to the Handmade Dev community is that we are finding so many people who know how to code, but want to feel more in control of their programs. Many people following my Handmade Quake project have told me that they&#x27;re considering learning C for the first time ever. Maybe that&#x27;s a good position for C to take in 2016 - a language to learn once you&#x27;ve learned your first language and some simple logic but want to understand the hardware better, or figure out exactly what code is running when you turn on your Python interpreter. I hope the community is able to plant that seed in the minds of as many programmers as possible.",1454349874

Maybe that’s a road that some developers will never need to walk down at all, depending on their focus.</i><p>His position is that, while C may not be the best language for everyone coming into programming it is beneficial to learn it eventually because it allow you to peel back the layers of abstraction underneath all of the goodies in your high-level language.

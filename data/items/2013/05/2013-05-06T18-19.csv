Sure, not every programmer has to know high school math. You can, for example, do great work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without knowing high school math. But there are certain fields where math is unavoidable. Signal processing is one of them. And the internationally accepted notation for such math is part of what you're expected to know.<p>BWT, I assume you're not saying China uses different mathematical notation. I wouldn't know about that. If so, then that does undermine my argument.",1367866712

I would consider it the first thing Adobe has done right in a long time.<p>A year's subscription is less than what I bill per day and I have access to every app that they produce.  I can run it on my laptop, my other laptop, as well as my desktop machine that just gathers dust these days.<p>As someone who has used Photoshop since Version 3.0, I can say, with some authority I guess, that the current version is really, <i>really</i> good.  Except for the crop tool.  The crop tool sucks.  It sucks so bad I had to write a replacement stand alone app.  All they need to do to fix it is put the image resizing step back in, instead of having to do that separately.<p>Their other apps are also improving in quality from a low point of a few years ago.  Premiere is solid, After Effects is way faster than the previous version, Prelude and SpeedGrade are a little inaccessible but once you learn the non-standard UIs are useful tools.  Illustrator is still a bit of a drag though.  I don't touch InDesign unless I'm designing a photo book for Blurb.<p>And then there is the whole extensibility of the suite that most people don't get too involved in, but I do.  We started out writing some pretty heavy javascript extendscript stuff to do asset prep but have since moved on to Flex + Adobe Creative Suite Extension SDK.  Was kind of gnarly to get going, but once going has allowed us to extend Photoshop into a full blown authoring tool for the kind of retail iPad apps we build for clients.  What once took us about 2-3 weeks to build, now takes about a day thanks to that.<p>So, +1 Adobe.",1367866516

We designed a majority of the controls and UI components using canvas and found it incredibly fast when the proper caching techniques were used.<p>One of the components of the application I worked on was a text editor that resembled Apple's Pages software. The text editor was implemented entirely in canvas and would wrap live in response objects intersecting the text. Redrawing the text live was slow but we ended up finding a solution. We cached bitmaps of the characters, lines and paragraphs and only re-rendered areas of the canvas that changed.<p>The code was open sourced and put on GitHub, if anyone is interested:<p><a href=""https://github.com/austinsarner/Frappuccino/tree/master/FrappKit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/austinsarner/Frappuccino/tree/master/Frap...</a><p>P.S.

5664018,comment,5660897,5663690,1,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"Thanks again. If I am right though, the memory barriers could also have been skipped without thread-local values since, due to the barriers on init, no thread's view would revert to it's pre-init state anyway. As rbehrends mentions, barriers are not the only factor... For example, global memory access may be slower on some systems due to decreased locality (a property provided by the TLS), but I don't know what if any value that would have in this benchmark. There is also a comment on that page that does the same thing as my TLS-free approach using a more reasonable static global initialization syntax in Java in response to a question of if D's initialization would be semantically equivalent too.<p>Edit: (Not waiting for reply link to appear...) When I say ""the memory barriers could also be skipped"" I am referring to any other memory barriers past those associated with initialization, not those associated with initialization. There would be memory barriers at initialization, but that is the only need for memory barriers and I believe that is provided here by the synchronized keyword. The object presented in the article then looks like a cache-friendlier version of a single global variable with the necessary barriers limited to the initialization of the global instance pointer (which might also be done as in the Java example given in the comments on the page). The TLS does not eliminate the need for any barriers, only helps eliminate non-local reads. That might allow a performance gain depending on the cache behavior (or, for example, in the presence of NUMA), but it hasn't reduced the need for locking IMHO.",1367865979

It probably has a lot to do with the rapidly increasing difference in one's quality of life that deep technical knowledge of various kinds can produce for individuals. It will never be productive to launch crusades with mottos like ""everyone can program!"" or ""everyone can do math!"" because these crusades presume that everyone who <i>can</i> do X <i>should</i> do X.

Language, just like mathematics, tries to solve the problem of communication but while language is more about the expression of emotions, thoughts, and feelings, mathematics is meant to describe precise ideas and abstractions in a quantified way. While language can be ambiguous in how it relays our true intentions, mathematics is anything but. It is the only method humanity has that, through experiment and observation, can help us reach for and perhaps even attain absolute truth.<p>Just like reading/writing, you don't learn mathematics (real maths, not arithmetic) to be able to scribble symbols on a piece of paper. You learn it to develop a way of thinking that promotes certainty and helps you develop and understand complex abstract ideas that describe how the world works. When you dive deep into math (or programming for that matter), you don't just learn a subject, your brain actually reconfigures itself and fundamentally changes how you act and think. This effect, called neuroplasticity, functions pretty much until you die so it's never too late to learn math.<p>When someone says that they can't ""do"" math it says nothing about their intellect. All it says is that they didn't like the mathematical equivalent of ""The Cat in the Hat"" taught in primary school and are now going to live (many quite proudly) without the mental faculties to express and grok abstract and complicated ideas and systems.

It's going to be very hard for a student to learn to view mathematics as reason if their teachers don't see it that way.<p>There was a point when I was in grade school and we were learning formulas for the area of different shapes.  When a trapezoid came up and I noted that it could be decomposed into a square and two triangles, I was admonished to just use the formula from the handout.  Don't get in the habit of trying to think while doing math, it'll just get you in trouble.<p>This was from an otherwise excellent teacher, but when it came to math we were to turn the thinking switch to ""off"".  This fear of math seemed to not been exceptional, even among my high school math instructors.

Let's face the facts - every business utilizes technology in this day and age.  Is ToysRUs (toys) a tech company?  Or Airbnb (real estate)?  Or even Uber (transportation services)?  Companies are categorised by industry, not the tools they use to run their business.  If McDonalds adds an iPhone app for ordering burgers or gets robots to make the burgers - it's still in the fast-food industry.  So what's a ""tech startup""?  There's no such thing imo.  There's the software industry & the hardware industry.  Microsoft is in the software industry, a classic example of a ""tech company"".  Apple does both.  Boeing does hardware.  What about Google & Facebook?  Are these tech or media companies?  After all, their revenues come from selling ads.  They are the new magazines, the new yellow pages, the new classifieds.<p>I sure wish we had more ""technology companies"" making great new leaps in software, operating systems, hardware, etc.  Unfortunately there aren't many examples of such companies becoming billion dollar businesses, compared to the variety of other industries that fit under the ""e-commerce"" umbrella.

5663890,comment,5663776,5663776,1,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>Why is it that something seems to be much appreciated by the community, but no journalist seems interested?</i><p>Hard to say.  Bloggers are usually always hungry for content, but the popular blogs are harder to crack, as they get enough eyeballs that people compete to get on their sites.  Remember that they're ultimately eyeing everything through a lens of ""What is going to get me the most ad impressions and generate me the most revenue""?<p>Getting press coverage isn't necessarily as simple as ""get on the front page of HN, get mentioned by $FOO publication"".  The field of PR is a big area, with a lot of accumulated idioms, patterns, experts, relationships, etc.<p><i>Should I continue writing emails to these people until they either block me or reply?</i><p>I would.  What do you have to lose?  Don't be annoying or whiny or turn into a stalker, of course.  But there's a lot to be said for persistence.<p><i>Or should I skip tech journalists and try to find another way to make service visible to more people?</i><p>One thing I'm a big fan of, is the work of Ryan Holiday, author of <i>Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of A Media Manipulator</i>[1].  You might also find some value in a fairly basic book on PR like <i>The New Rules of Marketing and PR</i>[2] or some of the ""Guerilla Marketing"" stuff by Jay Conrad Levinson[3].<p>Also, if it's really important to you to get coverage, hiring a PR person isn't always a bad idea.  I know there's been a lot of negative stuff said on HN lately about PR agencies and startups, but part of the ""secret sauce"" is the pre-existing relationships these guys have with journalists.  It may or may not be fair, but a good PR person can help you get coverage that would be hard to generate organically.  If you're even slightly interested, I know a good PR guy who might be able/willing to help. Shoot me an email and I can arrange an introduction.<p>One final thought, is to try using a press release submission service like PRWeb[4] or PRNewsWire[5].  It will cost you a little bit of money, but it's an option to get some attention.  Note that you won't get TechCrunch / Gizmodo type coverage out of this (well, probably not anyway), but your thing should at least wind up listed in Google News.<p>There's also a lot of interesting PR related advice on Quora.

So resolving how the project is meant to handle COI without shutting off their best contributions is difficult and can involve lots of rules-lawyering.<p>Again, these kinds of arguments always seem to take for granted that we are talking about perhaps one of the most successful group projects in the history of the Internet; Wikipedia is, of course, an achievement on par with many of the best of the last 20 years.

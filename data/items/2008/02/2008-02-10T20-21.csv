113077,comment,113057,113057,0,0,tptacek,,,"I can give you two good reasons for being secretive that you may not have considered:<p>* If you're entering a competitive space --- and particularly if you have a direct sales model with medium-long sales cycle (ie, you sell to companies) --- your competitors can neutralize you without copying your features. All a company with a shipping product has to do is ""roadmap"" your features for you to lose competitive advantage.<p>* There's what Joel calls ""The Marimba Effect"". As long as you keep quiet about what you're doing, your failures and missteps don't count against you. Once you launch, prospects can start to form an opinion that's hard to shake off.<p>I can't say that these are dealbreakers if you're starting some social calendaring service for pets, or (like most YC'ers) considering some kind of social network code autoindentation product for MzSchemers. But we are not awash in examples of companies that opened up early, launched small, and went on to huge success.",1202677041

This is troubling because the idea also has a stream of positive comments, making it that much more attractive.""<p>You should add to that what REALLY happens when people respond to it.  They start talking about it.  They bury you in great ideas that never occurred to you.  They sign up to be notified about your private beta.  You are incredibly energized and motivated all of a sudden.  You are no longer fearful that your idea will totally fall flat.  Recruiting gets easier.  Good developers who are interested in your problem/space seek you out.  Investors (who know all of this) don't think you are a total noobcake.  You don't have to invest time or money in stuff like NDAs or other secretive measures.<p>Stealth mode is 95% of the time totally ridiculous, with the risk of being out there totally eclipsed by the reward.  There is the 5% case, I suppose, where you've truly invented something unique rather than just making something suck less.<p>I'm also absolutely FLOORED by your statement that the ""...Nobody liked it. Your idea is probably unspectacular."" scenario is not a good outcome.  That's a spectacular outcome compared to pissing away months or years building something that you later realize nobody wants.<p>(IMO)",1202676992
113075,comment,112857,112857,0,0,staunch,,,"I try to do this as well. I also have a really strict rule about never doing copy/paste. I <i>always</i> type every last character into my programs. Partly because I'm ridiculously anal about not having any extraneous characters slip in, but mostly because it slows me down enough to make sure I commit everything to memory.",1202676948

They increase the total cost of using your software, and in a perfectly fungible world ruled by rationality that's extra money you could be charging them for bug free software.<p>It also helps with massively distributed software where invidiuals are less likely to report bugs (without some kind of automated bug sendoff tool). Netscape had their $50 bug scheme, for instance.",1202676881

113070,comment,113060,113060,0,0,joshwa,,,"Search != Display.<p>The real comparison is whether ads placed on social sites do worse than Google's display (AdSense) networks.<p>If they do (and it sounds like they do), it's likely because the majority of social sites don't show up in search engine result pages (SERPs). My understanding is that most/many of the clicks on AdSense come from people clicking search results, and then seeing an ad relevant to their on one of the pages they click through.<p>Display will never equal search; intent isn't there. The only real money to be made in display is a) via SERPs and b) branding/influence ads, whose effectiveness is not easy to measure, since it isn't about clickthroughs.<p>And the social sites will need to move either to brand ads or to truly <i>social</i> ad concepts (ala facebook fan pages) that become part of the app’s experience and don’t draw users offsite.",1202676608

113063,comment,113057,113057,0,0,johnrob,,,"I think there is a catch 22 when revealing your start up idea.  Imagine if you posted it on this site.  You'd end up with two scenarios:<p>- Nobody liked it.  Your idea is probably unspectacular.<p>- People responded well to it.  Your idea, which just got validated, is now also available for public consumption.  This is troubling because the idea also has a stream of positive comments, making it that much more attractive.<p>Neither of these outcomes are good, which is probably why start-ups are secretive.",1202675388

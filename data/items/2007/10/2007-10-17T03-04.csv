Scotch me when you get to so and so's place, or Scoth me when you are going for dinner...<p>One of the cellphone providers would also give you a code *147 or something and someone's number and it would send a ""please call me"" text message with your number included. People would say. Send me a ""please call me"" when you are there... <p>Everyone does it.",1192593275

68920,comment,68901,68908,0,0,chaostheory,,,"I think it's more about being fair. <p>I think one of Co-opetition's (<a href=""http://mayet.som.yale.edu/coopetition/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mayet.som.yale.edu/coopetition/index.html</a>) main ideas has it nailed. While this doesn't involve business competitors, it's still about players of a game giving up maximizing their own individual gains, to share it with one another<p>in this case we can think of the consumer as a player of a game where they have three general choices:<p>a) maximum gain - pay nothing (assuming they don't buy anything else from RadioHead; Radiohead loses big) and enjoy the music<p>b) minimal gain - pay what they think is full price (buy extra stuff, ...) and enjoy the music<p>c) mixed gain - pay what they think is a discounted price (less than a cd) and enjoy the music; neither Radiohead nor the consumer maximize their gains in the short term but both of them  benefit moderately. Radiohead has an incentive to keep publishing hits and the customer can keep enjoying them (without being robbed by the record industry).",1192592135

68906,comment,68781,68781,0,0,ALee,,,"Arrington's argument is no. I tend to agree with him. The best part of the article is when starts comparing it to a mall, and it oddly works... <p>""Hong is better off sticking HotorNot in the mall than trying to get people to come to his standalone site... the social network landlord could one day create its own... like a mall owner opening his own clothing store to compete with the Gap, greeting people at the door with flyers as they enter the mall, and charging his store below-market rent... Then, of course, there's the fact that malls tend to lose their foot traffic as soon as a newer one opens up down the road.""<p>I would add that the whole real estate analogy has been used quite a lot in technology. The only difference is that no matter if you create a super-regional shopping malls (Mills), the great power of the internet is that people can leave your place lightning fast.",1192590785

68904,comment,68455,68455,0,0,fleddermaus,,,"Yah, who would have thought that a guy in the 1920's would write a master thesis suggesting the idea that you could transfer information electronically in 1's and 0's (claude E. Shannon).  <p>What I find more interesting is that it wasn't the idea that took time to develop, but the technology.  Without people dreaming and working on ideas, we wouldn't be where we are.  The beauty of the night sky lies in the constellations, not the indivdiual stars.  If there was only one star, we'd get bored, but individuals stars are fun to look at because they increase the total beauty of the constellation.<p>So, if you want to change the world, shine like a star and belong to a constellation.  <p>The allure of a small business is that it is not entrenched in keeping the status quo, but excitedly endeavoring to ask the next big question, ""why the hell not?""",1192590486

The quality of the product speaks for it self really. Some have been good, others weak. Regardless I dont think it has any affect on credibility of others announcing their launch here. The goal is just to show people what you've built and get feedback, right? If a product is truly good, it will gain dedicated users and begin its viral spread.",1207288155

Then he follows his straw man with an over-generalization and appeal to ridicule:<p><i>""anyone with above average willpower has a busy enough life not to have time to participate in psychological surveys""</i><p>and an appeal to personal belief (which also happens to be biased, and begs the original question):<p><i>""I think I possess above average powers of will, but I would never test them against things I thought were pointless.""</i><p>Finally, he closes by quoting a section of the original article out of context, and misinterpreting the meaning:<p><i>""there are tons of higher level masters of teaching willpower, but since they donâ€™t have neuroscience degrees, this article neglects to give them a voice....Why use 10% of the article on a guess, when a phone call could bring an expert with data.""</i><p>(the original Times article explains that the theory of glucose-induced willpower was tested in specific experiments, and found to have some merit.)<p>For a guy who wants to take a science reporter to task for sloppy reporting, he sure does play fast-and-loose with the logical fallacies....",1207287647

Let's call it $50 million a year. (This is probably high--grateful for any help in refining).""<p>What is he smoking?  Sure they have a lot of page views, but man, you can do a lot for $50 million a year.  Craigslist's site is as bare as it could be.  All static html, that is probably just generated using whatever scripting language it wants.  I'm there is some engineering challenges and that they go through a good bit of bandwidth, but i mean, I feel like this guy is off by like an order of magnitude.  Now, I don't know squat about serious big iron servers and doing stuff that large, but its definitely not $50million to run it.  A guy in the site's comments puts the yearly cost at $1 million and he even over-estimates a bit in my book.<p>Also, all these analysts always speculate about how much money craigslist could make if they charged for <i>all</i> job postings and ads.  As soon as they started charging for anything more than what they do they would probably get an order of magnitude less postings.  Then they would just another monster.com/careerbuilder.com/etc crappy clone.  Whats great now is that people can post whatever they want for free, with the few exceptions that help pay for it all (and still probably make Craig rich).

154566,comment,154490,154490,0,0,LPTS,,,"They actually have a lot of the pieces out there but unconnected.  I will answer the question.<p>Willpower is an equilibrium between two distinct drives, one of which is a drive to act, and one of which is an inhibitory drive.  The first step to growing willpower is to make sure your lack of willpower isn't caused by a biological problem or a mental health problem.  Before struggling too long to grow willpower, have a physical, have your thyroid level checked, and get a mental health evaluation.<p>The reason you can build willpower is that it is an equilibrium between the parts of your brain that produce fear and anxiety and the parts of your brain that produce good feelings.  Your right prefrontal cortex produces negative emotions, and your left prefrontal cortex produces positive emotions.  This circuitry is linked up to the circuitry that primes your body to move.  Assuming no mental or physical illness, willpower is simply a measure of the relation between these systems.<p>We know that monks who meditate for 10,000 hours have much greater gamma ray function.  Gamma rays underlie large scale brain synchronization.  These monks also had a different relationship between the left and right prefrontal cortexs (corti?).  In monks, the positive emotion producing left prefrontal cortex was much more active than the right.  Also, they were much more primed to move.<p>Meditation, particularly certain kinds from Zen Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism, are scientifically proven to work on this, to such a degree that neuroscientists haven't seen some of those neurological states in normal people.  From studying these monks, we know what to do.<p>It's scientifically proven that you can grow willpower by getting a physical, and a mental health eval, and then meditating.  It's the best, most efficient way.  Everything the nyt article lists as a way of increasing willpower is an example of an activity where you must be continually bringing your attention into the present.  I don't want to sound like some stupid hippy, but meditation can be the most concentrated way to practice this focusing of attention, and directing your focus in certain Tibetan buddhist ways hits all the main parts of increasing motivation.<p>I consulted <a href=""http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma8/monkstudy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma8/monkstudy.html</a> to refresh my memory on the monk neurology study.",1207286370

If you base advertising on my on-line behavior it may be viewed as too invasive. Another key attraction is that it doesn't interrupt me when I am in flow, so you are probably limited to presenting ads during the analytics so that I am not interrupted when I am actually working.

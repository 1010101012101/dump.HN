For example, the ""m"" part of the digested string is composed of parts that are concatenated without delimiters (just like the old AWS authentication digest); one implementation was vulnerable to message forgery because it could be convinced to split the same string in more than one way.",1256842687

910565,comment,910203,910415,0,0,tptacek,,,"What you just designed is an AE cipher mode (with ""additional data"", meaning in this case ""all the data""). Your AE mode uses SHA1 instead of a permutation of a block cipher.<p>The reason nobody would do this in the real world is that there are already AE cipher modes that are much faster than this, and those modes are NIST standards that have been beaten to death.<p>Interesting sidenote: one of the most famous AE modes is OCB, which is Phil Rogaway's patented mode. Much of the literature of other AE modes is based on coming up with patent-free alternatives to OCB --- they include EAX, GCM, and CCM. One force that drives real scrutiny into these modes --- there are proposed attacks on some constructions of CCM, for instance --- is the fact that a really good mode is patented, and the people who own the patent are particularly incented to analyze the unencumbered competitors.<p>Anyways, one of the things that makes the ""real"" AE modes faster than your proposed bespoke mode is that they can take advantage of the block cipher engine to ""fingerprint"" the message, instead of having to use an entire hash function. An inaccurate but maybe illuminating way to understand that is to imagine that AES gets extra security with lower overhead because it's designed to integrate a key, where SHA1 isn't designed to take a key and has to incur extra overhead to meet its safety margin.",1256841931

910562,comment,909981,910496,0,0,doki_pen,,,"Absolutely wrong.  I wish ppl would stop spreading this nonsense.  64 bit is actually slower in practice, since addresses double in size.  It also causes nearly double the memory consumption, since all libraries become twice as big, so when you upgrade to 64 bit, you should actually double the memory you wanted on 32 bit.  There are only 2 reasons why you need 64 bit:<p>* You need to compute extremely large numbers.  You'll get big performance boosts here.<p>* You need more then ~3.5 G ram.  In which case you actually have to buy AT LEAST 8G to see a positive impact.  Even this is not a hard requirement, as there are work arounds in 32-bit.  But 64-bit is an absolute must if an individual process needs that much ram.<p>note:  I see I'm voted down, and maybe I'm a little harsh in my comment, but can anyone add any other reasons to go to 64 bit?  I've read a ton over the years and those are the only two I could find.  Maybe I should add ""because 64 is bigger then 32 and I can tell ppl my OS is 64 bit""<p>edit:  Double is a great exaggeration,  but not as much as the replies indicated.  I moved from a 64-bit slicehost with 512M to a 32-bit linode with 320M and have LESS memory woes.  The libraries really are almost twice as big.

There are some things that the right name can help with:<p>- It gets really boring to have to spell your name out to everyone you meet and talk to. Therefore having one that is unambiguously easy to communicate will save you hours at the boot strapping stage where one of the primary forms of marketing is talking to a lot of people at a lot of events.<p>- Having a name that can only be spelled (or, mostly only spelled) one way will stop a potential competitor stealing traffic. You don't want to be PlayBlox.com when PlayBlocks.com gets bought up by an offshore competitor who you can't sue. Equally ColourLite.com would suck as a name with potentially four common variants to buy or lose traffic to.<p>I certainly think that memorability is overrated.

If the ""extra"" women aren't graduating at a reasonable rate, did admitting them do them any good?  Or, is that the wrong question?<p>Looking at the numbers, we see a change from 89 men and 7 women (96 total) to 83 men and 49 women (132 total) enrolled.<p>Looking at admission rates shows us how it was done.  The women's admission rates were basically unchanged, from 34% to 36%, so the increase in women admitted and enrolled is due almost entirely to the increase in applications by women.  At the same time, the overall admission rates dropped from 26% to 12%.  Since the population has only two components, men and women, and the rates for women were unchanged means that the admission rates for men dropped significantly.<p>I wonder what relationship the admissions criteria have to success in the program.<p>However, the numbers suggest another question.

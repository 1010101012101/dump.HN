A decent employer should be able to see the potential (2) when meeting (1), at least within two or three interviews.<p>It&#x27;s not lazyness, it&#x27;s a different strategy. Some companies decide to spend a lot of resources on hiring, and they are able to find great candidates where others wouldn&#x27;t look, and thus they get a strategic advantage. Usually, that&#x27;s a part of their overall strategy. But other companies decide that they are in a different situation, and would spend their resources on different areas. These companies don&#x27;t want to find a special superstar; instead of increasing reward (in hiring) they look to minimise the risks. And adjusting for correlating factors (degree, experience, etc), they get just like that: the minimise the risk.<p>> Like, past performance is not everything. You might get better work from someone stepping up to a new position than a burned out veteran holding that same position for years already.<p>You might. But we&#x27;re speaking about company strategy here. The company will make hundreds, thousands of hiring decisions. So we should think about them in terms of a statistical sample. What these companies want is not to increase the probability of high reward, but to reduce a standard deviation on these results: even if the results will be worse on average, it&#x27;s important that they won&#x27;t reach a certain low limit.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d like to suggest you to think about the process differently: don&#x27;t think about it as a decision that applied in your particular case, but think about it as a set of principles that should carry the company through the years, while it hires a <i></i>lot<i></i> of people. I think all this makes a lot more sense this way.",1431862326

You can do it, dogs can do it, it&#x27;s no big deal, BUT ONLY if you feel safe and secure.<p>The most important part is to get yourself to the point where you feel mostly at ease in the water. You can train yourself by spending a lot of time in the pool. Start in the shallow end, sit on the stairs or just squat down, stick your face in the water, and blow some bubbles. Pull your head out, take a breath, and go back in. Do that for a while, then pull your head out when you start to need air but stick your face back in the water immediately without taking a breath. You can stand up anytime you like, so take a moment to notice that your need for air wasn&#x27;t as urgent as it seemed. You can stay under a few more seconds before lifting your head out again, and when you come out, take a relaxed deep breath instead of gasping as if you were dying. Show yourself that you are in control and doing just fine.<p>Keep playing games like these. Get a little deeper, go farther under water, do little flips under water, and so on. When your face is pointing up, the air sometimes comes out of your nose and cold water rushes in and hits your sinuses--nobody likes the feeling, but after a few times, it won&#x27;t be anything more than an annoyance, so just spend a lot of time getting used to all of these feelings. That&#x27;s what kids do. Kids get their heads pushed under water by bigger kids, and before long they realize that it never kills them.<p>Take as long as you need to play around in the water (weeks?, months?, no rush) and get used to all the new feelings. And then take another swimming class and learn the skills without all the anxiety. (And assume you&#x27;ll have to keep going back for your own underwater therapy refresher courses occasionally for the rest of your life to maintain your comfort level.) Hope this helps.",1431862263

It might have started with something as simple as Newton mentioning a falling fruit by way of illustration during a lecture, but as people pass the story around embellishments that resonate stack up. Apples, as you note, have rich cultural connotations involving intelligence in general and instantaneous revelation in particular (interestingly, Genesis does not actually mention apples, referring only to &quot;fruit&quot;, which would seem to suggest that apples get their symbolism from somewhere else. Possibly their brain-like cross section?). The more recent retellings have added the embellishment that Newton was not just inspired by a falling apple but <i>literally struck</i> by one, the apple serving as a physical manifestation of an idea.<p>So I think the guiding principle is not so much &quot;how can we poetically represent Newton&quot; as &quot;what do humans think is cool&quot;.",1431861235

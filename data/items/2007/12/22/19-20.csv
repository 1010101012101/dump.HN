I'd suspect your mail header are not correctly filled first. If you're not using a local relay your mail may be rejected?<p>Is there anything in any logs anywhere?",1198353138

92050,comment,91814,91833,0,0,tx,,,"From my personal (not very broad) experience and from talking to people who ran/developed free websites with accounts, a typical ratio of total accounts vs active accounts is 10:1, perhaps 10:3 if you are really good. On top of that (depends on the service) you may have a significant percentage of active accounts that represent the same user, but 10% of active accounts seems like a safe bet.<p>TB uploaded/downloaded numbers are really useless, they just thrown them in to look more impressive I suppose.<p>This means they probably have 20-40K of real active BaseCamp users.",1198352265

92044,comment,91811,91811,0,0,iamwil,,,"Consequently, I remember reading something that tried to explain the fourier transform using the same geometric interpretation of a rotating vector with its complex numbers.  I think waves can be thought of as rotations as any point on the wave is going through a cycle, and the FT can ""pick out"" different frequencies by looking at where the vector lands.  <p>I should go back and look at it.  To this day, I never really fully comprehended that and the butterflies in FFTs.",1198350665

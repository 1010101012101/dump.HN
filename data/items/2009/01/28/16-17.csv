454005,comment,452637,452831,0,0,abyssknight,,,"Personally, I think that would be an immature opinion. The language you write the application in has little to do with the outcome. I know of at least one company in town who moved from Ruby on Rails to ASP.NET recently. They were looking to hire new .NET developers to convert their code.<p>The issue is that the stack is expensive. Windows licenses, SQL Server licenses, hosting... It all piles up, and a start up cannot afford that out of the gate. MSFT has been making strides to inject into that market. Visual Web Developer Express is a good example. They are giving the IDE away for free.<p>That said, for start ups, certainly a Linux based stack is far more practical. I just think that discounting an entire language or stack because the company behind it isn't 'liked' by a minority in the community is off base.<p>Heck, one of the lead developers of PHP quit randomly. It happens, and the community plows ahead. If ASP.NET support just died, entire industries would have to rewrite but what they had already written will still work as is. Likewise when any new version of anything comes out there are rewrites. That is just the way our industry works.<p>You are right though, .NET is generally considered an 'enterprisey' solution. It does however help on a resume. Usually boosts your going salary by $10k or more. ;)",1233161411

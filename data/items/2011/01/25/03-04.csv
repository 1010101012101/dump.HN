If it is smaller they can't be sure that it is not some noise.<p>The data about these measures is hard to find. But after some googling the best data I could find are in <a href=""http://physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/apollo/highlights.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/apollo/highlights.html</a> .\nIt it possible to make some estimations from the graphs.<p>There are three sets of three graphs. They are very similar, so let's see only the first one.<p>In the first graph there is a dark line in the center that shows that there are more photons coming at the expected time, than before or after that time. The signal is easy to see, but it is difficult to get any numerical values from this graph.<p>From the second graph it is possible to read some numerical values. Each bar shows the number of photons that arrive in a 100 ps interval. They have probably a Poisson distribution, but for simplicity let's approximate that by a Normal distribution.<p>Before the peak, there are approximately 10 +/- 10 photons coming every 100 ps. (These values are estimated from the graph with a lot of zoom, I can't be very sure about them. The values seem to be scattered between 0 an 20, so I assume that the average is ~10 and the standard deviation is ~10.) These are the photons that come from others sources. So if no mirror is present in the moon, or the laser dos not have enough power, then this is the expected value during all the experiment.<p>At the peak, there are approximately 400 photons in the same time interval. The difference between this value and the average of the first values is like 40 times the standard deviation. So it is almost impossible that they get these peaks by a random chance. For example, the probability to get a value that is bigger than 5 standard deviation is less than 1E-6, for 10 standard deviation it is less than 1E-23, and for 40 standard deviation it is almost almost 0. And they get not only one, but 8 intervals with more than 100 photons.<p>After the peak, they get more photons than before the peak for technical problems. I see something like 20 +/- 20. Whit these numbers, the chance of a 400 photons peak is bigger, but still almost 0, but I think that the correct way to do the estimations is using the first values.<p>The third graph is an auxiliary measure with an earth based mirror to get the dispersion caused by the system.<p>The analysis in the web page is more elaborated. They estimate the shape of the mirror and use the data from the third graph to explain the shape of the peak.",1295927265

2137871,comment,2136448,2137479,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> What data structure has a more efficient access pattern?<p>The depends on what kind of access you will need.<p>For example, if you are going to be doing a lot of searching to determine whether a value is an element of a set, an array will take O(<i>n</i>) in the number of elements to do a linear search, while various self-balancing tree structures will be O(log<i>n</i>), and a hash table with a good choice of hash function will be even better. Unless you are working with <i>very</i> small data sets, arrays will rapidly lose out here.<p>If we're talking about a data structure that gets modified over time, then suppose you need to store a sequence of values in order, and you will often insert or remove elements in the middle of the sequence. A linked list or similar structure can perform these operations for O(1) cost, but an array is O(<i>n</i>) in the number of elements.<p>Of course, all data structures are ultimately kept in one big array of memory/drive, so you could argue that the array can be just as good as the other data structures in the examples above. However, I think that is a circular argument: you're just reinventing the alternative data structures.<p>> People default to arrays because 95% of the time they are either the best option or good enough that it's not worth worrying about.<p>Perhaps. Then again, perhaps this attitude of declaring the default, easy tool ""good enough"" instead of learning to use the right tool for the job is why in 2011 it still takes nearly a minute for my PC to boot in the morning and sometimes I still type faster than my state-of-the-art DTP software can manage to draw the letters on the screen.",1295926508

2137842,comment,2136448,2136448,0,0,jasonwatkinspdx,,,"I strongly disagree with many of the claims in this post:<p><i>""An array’s whole purpose is to be a mass of mutable state. Mutable state is hard for both humans and compilers to reason about. It will be hard for us to write compilers in the future that generate performant multi-core programs if developers use a lot of arrays.""</i><p>How does this conclusion follow from the premise? It also completely ignores that arrays are the natural expression of data in data parallel programs. Nearly all high performance parallel numerical code leverages arrays heavily (OpenMP, MATLAB, various GPU languages).<p><i>""If you are writing such an API, wrap the array in a ReadOnlyCollection<T> and return an IEnumerable<T> or an IList<T> or something, but not an array.  (And of course, do not simply cast the array to IEnumerable<T> and think you’re done!  That is still passing out variables; the caller can simply cast back to array!  Only pass out an array if it is wrapped up by a read-only object.)<p>That’s the situation at present. What are the implications of array characteristics for the future of programming and programming languages?""</i><p>This appears to be a correct criticism of the mechanics of arrays in C#, but I don't see how that generalizes to the topic of programming languages in general. For example, we might use some sort of copy on write approach to preserve single copy performance when not changing the array is the common case.<p><i>""Clock speeds have stopped increasing, transistor density has stopped increasing""</i><p>AFAIK transistor density is still tracking Moore's law and is expected to do so for quite some time (see SIA roadmaps).<p><i>""Parallelizing in a world with observable side effects means locks""</i><p>This ignores a whole class of wait free data structures. Some of the most interesting parallel langauge tools are built around such structures. For example, cilk is some extremely smart code centered around wait free dequeues.<p><i>""The “C” programming language is all about mechanisms. It lays bare almost exactly what the processor is actually doing, providing only the thinnest abstraction over the memory model.""</i><p>This is a common misconception that leads to many bugs and performance problems. Modern compilers make dramatic transformations of programs. The connection between what we assume based on the c abstract machine model and what the processor actually does is rather complex. My favorite example of this is how consuming function arguments that are pointers into temporary variables at the top of a function body actually generates shorter faster code. This is because it tells the compiler aliasing between the pointers is impossible. However, if you're using the misguided ""my c is close to what the processor does"" perspective you'd incorrectly assume these assignments result in a lot of wasted work.<p>I'm not even a c programmer and I know this. I'm quite tired of seeing this conceptual mistake from otherwise extremely knowledgeable people.<p><i>""Arrays demand imperative code, arrays are all about side effects, arrays make you write code which emphasizes how the code works, not what the code is doing or why it is doing it.""</i><p>Entirely incorrect. For example, one can elegantly express many parallel algorithms as binary recursion with an associative combining operator over trees of arrays. This is a very declarative way of programming that is both elegant and maximally expresses parallelism. See the various presentations by Guy Steele for a very clear presentation of this perspective.<p>As a summary, I'm impressed by the posters knowledge of C# and how deeply he's considered this problem, but I think at the root of his thinking is an assumption that nearly all languages will be similar to C#. I disagree, and I think languages that center on nested data parallelism over arrays will play a major role in the future of programming.",1295925984

A JIT has better access to this information, and so can be more aggressive in leveraging it.<p>I'm not familiar with how common these techniques are in production JVM's, but as they're becoming common in javascript implementations I'd assume it's equally common.",1295924807

System admins aren't disappearing - they're specializing into 2 distinct professions:<p>* Those working for infrastructure <i>providers</i> (IBM, Amazon, Rackspace) focus on the bottom half of the stack: everything from the datacenter's floor plan to switching and VM allocation.<p>* Those working for infrastructure <i>consumers</i> (everybody else) focus on the upper half: the business's software stack, how to glue it together, and where to run it.<p>Conclusion: system admin, as a profession, is gradually disappearing. But it's being replaced by 2 <i>better</i> professions: more challenging work, higher perceived value within the organization, and higher demand.",1295924606

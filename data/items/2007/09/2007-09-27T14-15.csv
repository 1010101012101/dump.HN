60262,comment,60128,60254,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The business side of this is cold and harsh, as it always is.<p>
But as far as keeping a friend? He's a teacher, right? Why don't you sell him on the idea about learning how other startups succeed? I'll never forget reading ""A Good Hard Kick in the Ass"" several years ago. It completely changed the way I understood how startups work. Perhaps you could sell him on the idea that you're feeling a little frustrated, and perhaps other teams out there have learned something that might be useful to you guys.<p>
I also liked ""Founders at Work"" which I read a while ago. I wouldn't bury the guy in material -- after all, if you give him too much he'll just blow it off. But I'd find some text that made the case and _was presented by another person who is an authority_. That way, it's not a you vs. him deal, it's just a couple of friends discovering how things work.<p>
Good luck. If he's smart and your friend I'm sure he'll see the value of a structured approach to creativity. The trick is to be non-confrontational. Let the ideas battle it out, and not the people.",1190905042

I will attempt them again.<p>As far as getting him to stop looking at competitors, 100% agreed.",1190904095

60255,comment,60128,60212,0,0,joe,,,"We are all idea guys in one sense. The reason I've been referring to one guy as the ""idea guy"" is that he's not a coder and if I were to gauge the number of ideas each of us has put forth, he would easily take the highest percentage. So because he mostly talks to clients on the phone, does other PR-related things, and brainstorms ideas, I find it easy to refer to him as the ""idea guy"".",1190903998
60254,comment,60128,60214,0,0,joe,,,"> It sounds like what you've got is more of a painful group hobby. I think it might be time to consider a better format for being productive.<p>I think you're right, at least for my part. One problem is that the idea guy IS my friend, but I don't think he shares my point of view about this. I wrote up the blog post in order to collect my thoughts to relate them to him.",1190903786

60249,comment,60128,60128,0,0,edw519,,,"I commend your efforts.  It's not easy to go through this.  And it's smart of you to share and ask for help.  Very smart.<p>You asked.  I won't be bashful.  Take my feedback however you want (or tell me to go to h*ll).<p>You do not have a startup.  You have a hobby.  A startup is full time.  Greater than full time.<p>Like you, I'm a hacker.  I simply cannot imagine giving up equity to a designer or an ""idea man"" (whatever that is).  Design is grossly overrated (see Google).  Ideas are everywhere.  Only a fool pays for them.  People should be paying you to give you ideas (more about that below).<p>I understand that these are your friends and that you love working with them.  Nothing wrong with that.  What's more important to you, the quality time you spend together or the outcome?  I think you have a tough decision to make because, frankly, I don't see you having both.  You don't need these guys.<p>I would seriously consider taking your employer's offer to relocate.  This would give you a graceful exit from your current endeavor and preserve your friendships.  Then I would bank every dollar I could in order to go back to my start-up full-time.  You should be able to work full-time for at least 6 months, preferably a year.  I would also try to pick up side jobs somewhat related to my start-up.  Pick up a few extra bucks and get your ideas FROM THOSE WHO ARE PAYING YOU.  These are real ideas coming from the field, not from some ivory tower.  So the logic is reversed: you can pay for untested ideas, or get paid for real ones.<p>You don't mention whether your employment is related to your start-up in any way.  If it's not, all the more reason to pick up side work.<p>I would also try to make connections with other hackers; maybe you can find more suitable co-founders.<p>(By the way, the comment about open and honest communication is spot on.  Talk to your partners!)<p>You've got quite a few things to think about and a lot of good feedback from both places.  Please - keep us posted.  You never know where this may lead...",1190902518

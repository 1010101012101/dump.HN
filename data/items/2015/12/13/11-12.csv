To make a long story short, I&#x27;ve concluded that glasses are a nasty crutch for most people. With wearing lenses for every waking activity, people never realize that their visual acuity is actually substantially variable, depending on their latest mode of visual activity. Too much reading and computer work, and the distance vision becomes worse (for myopia). Start examining details in the mid/far distance, usually outside, and the acuity immediately begins improving, though very gradually.<p>After a few years mostly without my glasses, all visual situations have greatly improved, even at night.

Just learn to live with it and perhaps force yourself to take longer &quot;tours of duty&quot; in jobs. Consecutive jobs held less than 1 year is universally considered a red flag by employers, as is getting fired. Engagements lasting 2 years in fast-paced industries are generally OK. If you&#x27;re good at what you do you can probably control your urge to quit for a bit longer and do enough to not get fired. 2 years is not a long time and if you&#x27;re able to do other things besides work, it can be a great advantage to have a job while exploring new things.<p>Another thing to consider is your life outside of work and your relationships with family or a significant other. If you&#x27;re defining yourself strictly through work and ignoring the role you play in the lives of others, you&#x27;re going experience some profound disappointments.

I use xmonad, you can use the mouse to select windows and even drag them around (though the combination of floating and tilled windows is ugly and unproductive). You have to configure everything from a text file with comments, but how is that any different from a GUI with labels and input boxes? It shouldn&#x27;t take you more than a few days to get used to the shortcuts or define your own.

I watched three people say &quot;no&quot; to a significant, new piece of very important software that replaced completely our legacy data storage/fetching/processing methods. They said &quot;no&quot; for the reasons you&#x27;d expect; not properly specified, unreasonable expectations of basically magic on the part of management, very improbable timescale.<p>In one meeting, when a very skilled programmer (who goes to the C++ committee meetings and that sort of thing) said &quot;no&quot;, the response was &quot;Well then I&#x27;ll find someone who can.&quot; What they got, of course, was someone who didn&#x27;t say &quot;no&quot; (and of course, there&#x27;s an element of self-selection here; given that some skilled, competent software engineers said no, the person who said yes was, harsh as it may sound, an adequate <i>programmer</i> but an incompetent software engineer). What we got was a total car crash of software, six months late, that&#x27;s massively unsuitable, doesn&#x27;t do what&#x27;s needed, undocumented, untested, everything bad that you&#x27;d expect. A great deal of the 40 &quot;release candidates&quot; were desperate fixes to this car crash, that our recently appointed new software architect is planning to take outside and execute in the car park as soon as we get a &quot;release&quot;. So that was a great use of a year.<p>Where this is going is that saying &quot;no&quot; didn&#x27;t actually stop them finding someone who wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;no&quot;. On the plus side, the person who delivered this truly atrocious software to us is now actively looking for another job. Not that he was fired, no no, but he&#x27;s now got zero credibility and nobody wants to work on anything he ever touched.<p>Christ, I wish I&#x27;d just gone into mathematics.",1450004459

It has always been an opt-in deal, the users who trust us may turn it on so provide us with data. For the first 4 years the data sat without any use until recently where Evidon figured out how to turn it into money. Even so, the data Evidon sells has nothing about any user, merely tracker data. Here are some samples of whats actually delivered to clients: <a href=\"http://www.knowyourelements.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.knowyourelements.com/</a> and <a href=\"http://www.evidon.com/evidon-trackermap/tagchains-static.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.evidon.com/evidon-trackermap/tagchains-static.htm...</a>.<p>As I said, we do not trick the users into anything, and are as transparent about where the data goes as possible, if you have suggestions how to increase this then please let us know. We currently cover this question in every listing Ghostery has, all options pages, web site, FAQ, and many posts on our blog.<p>As far as defaults: originally, Ghostery was a detection software designed to &quot;reveal the invisible web&quot;, but has added blocking since. Our official stance is that we do not make decisions for the user, but we do run every user through an install wizard that explains whats up. Disconnects stance here is a different, they do offer default blocking, tho they also have their own &quot;whiteliest&quot; built into it without telling the users about it. We are going to add some easy configuration in the near future that will pre-block stuff, but this is still in the works.<p>Finally, Ghostery source is available for review for &quot;sneakiness&quot; since every extension is pure javascript. We host it here if you&#x27;re interested: <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/ghosteries/chrome/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ghostery.com/ghosteries/chrome/</a> and you can just unzip any other extension to extract source.",1386780868

I&#x27;m not going to be running desktop computers during an extended outage, and laptops will add a negligible impact. In colder weather I&#x27;d want enough power to run the gas furnace, which I imagine is not a ton.

Thus: a few hundred watts.<p>But let&#x27;s say you need 2kW. (That&#x27;s not quite double what a normal car can put out, from my quick research. Typical car systems seem to top out around 1200W, give or take.) The Tesla would be able to provide that no problem, of course, but! It&#x27;ll only do so for about 22 hours before you run the battery all the way down, at which point you have no electricity and no transportation and no way to remedy either until the power comes back on. If you really do need 4kW then your Tesla will last you half a day, which is just about useless.

The FDA action is consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations in the United States and with agricultural regulations in the European Union. We have discussed the science behind this no-brainer recommendation several times here on Hacker News.[1]<p>Yes, veterinarians may need to treat animal diseases with antibiotics. Antibiotics are in several cases &quot;natural&quot; substances that evolved through natural selection, mycotoxins emitted by fungi, or bacterial toxins emitted by one clade of bacteria, with the effect of killing bacteria in a world full of bacteria. The bacteria susceptible to antibiotics, in turn, have long been under selection pressure to evolve resistance to antiobiotics, as some strains of bacteria did long ago in the wild. The use of antibiotics in human medicine has revolutionized several forms of medical treatment and added millions of years of healthy life to humankind&#x27;s prospects, but use of antibiotics must go hand-in-hand with other forms of infection control to minimize selective sweeps of antibiotic resistance as a trait among most harmful strains of bacteria. It&#x27;s a bad trade-off to use antibiotics without veterinary indications in general animal husbandry, so this regulatory step is a step in the right direction.<p>Meanwhile, the already established multiple-drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis are very worrisome,[2] and will have to be a focus of much research and urgent public-health campaigns.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6599040\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6599040</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303444204577460734274201756\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230344420...</a><p><a href=\"http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-23/news/40134749_1_stop-tb-department-mario-raviglione-jmm-meeting\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-23/news...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Facing-the-Reality-of-Drug-Resistant-Tuberculosis-Challenges-and-Potential-Solutions-in-India.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Facing-the-Reality-of-Drug-R...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.tbcindia.nic.in/pdfs/RNTCP%20Response%20DR%20TB%20in%20India%20-%20Jan%202012%20update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tbcindia.nic.in/pdfs/RNTCP%20Response%20DR%20TB%2...</a>",1386778322

The obvious one is animal protein, which is structured and metabolized differently than plant protein. But more specifically:<p>- Vitamin B12, you don&#x27;t need a lot of it (a few grams of meat per week provides more than 100% of the dietary sources), but every single study of populations of Vegans shows that the majority of them are deficient and have Hyperhomocysteinemia as a result. Hyperhomocysteinemia is only ever seen in four populations, the extreme elderly (due to age related nutrition absorption and metabolic issues), third world countries with chronic poverty, extreme alcoholics and vegans. You can get by for a very long time as B12 deficient, but it will catch up to you and the result isn&#x27;t particularly pleasant. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6883090\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6883090</a> some more I&#x27;ve compiled on this<p>- DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), an Omega-3, pretty much available only from animal sources (and a very small algae source which is often used as a supplement precursor) has been shown important to normal cognitive functioning. Every study I&#x27;m aware of has shown that vegans are deficient in DHA (even though it <i>can</i> be synthesized from ALA which is the kind of Omega-3 found in flax seeds and chia etc. it&#x27;s preferentially synthesized to EPA another Omega-3 which also has plant sources). Omega-3 is essential and not all O3FAs are equal. Despite being able to find DHA in algae in sea vegetables, most vegans simply don&#x27;t eat enough of it.<p>- Vitamin A - readily discussed in Vegan sources as &quot;available in plants, but hard to get sufficient quantities of a complete source&quot;. Vitamin A is a group of compounds, not just one, and plant sources don&#x27;t offer a complete source. It&#x27;s readily available in animal sources, especially liver. Vegans are typically deficient in retinol which is used in the development of epithelial cells an essential and basic component of animal tissue.<p>Non-essential, but had to very hard to impossible to get in plant form in sufficient quantities (i.e. studies of vegan populations show shortfalls in the majority of the studied population):<p>- Arginine (partially synthesized by humans, but needs to be supplemented by food sources. Animal sources are much better sources than plans. But if you eat sufficient plant sources, which majority populations of vegans have been shown not to do, you can get by.<p>- Creatine, synthesized by Arginine, along with Methionine (which is better sourced from eggs then plants as well) and glycine (which is readily synthesized by humans), has been shown to be majority population deficient in every study of vegans I&#x27;m aware of. Creatine is important for muscle development and maintenance. You&#x27;ll find that vegan athletes are aware of this dietary shortfall and supplement.<p>- Carnosine, <i>only</i> available in animal sources. Carnosine has been shown to be an important dipeptide and important in normal muscle function (where it can be used to significantly boost performance with sources of beta-Alanine). It also has been shown to be a major preventative factor in Alzheimers, Diabetes proper skin function and various age related illnesses suggesting long term consumption is important for healthy long-term living.<p>- Vitamin-D - especially in northern latitudes or people who don&#x27;t get enough sun exposure. The primary dietary sources are all animal sources (beef liver, eggs, cheese, fish, etc.). Vegans have shown to have higher rates of vitamin D deficiency than other populations.<p>and it goes on and on and on.<p>Vegan diets also make adequate nutrition decisions and monitoring more complicated. For example, complete Zinc intake should be at around 15mg per day, but diets high in phytates require more as phytates disrupt zinc absorption. Similarly iron intake has to be measured at higher doses as what humans actually need is Heme, which is synthesized from Iron. Heme only has animal sources, which is generally used to explain anemia that&#x27;s common vegan populations.<p>In addition, animal sources are simply required for normal child development even if adults can get by for longer periods without some of the above. Studies of children raised on vegan diets show significant health and cognitive deficits as animal sources are either the only or the best sources of critical bone, blood, muscle and brain development.<p>Long term studies of vegans have shown that over 90% of vegans are deficient in one or more of the above, despite supplements being a traditional part of the vegan diet. Most vegans do not stay vegans for more than a few years as the health and nutrition deficits build up, they&#x27;ll wax on and off the diet -- this provides essential B12 at interval, and since B12 doesn&#x27;t require constant intake, is usually enough to keep off the worst effects of B12 deficiency. Carnosine however has been shown to be a significant problem in long-term vegan (and vegetarian) diets and is generally attributed to the reason why vegans, despite being healthier in several categories, die at ages and rates similar to omnivores.<p>Every single one of these deficiencies and health issues are solved on normal omnivorous diets.",1386778219

So, it&#x27;s better to compare it to Windows which permits running even unsigned apps by default, though it does black the screen and show a warning box with a big red exclamation point.<p>Realistically, I think the Mac laptops and desktops will continue along the &#x27;consumer&#x27; line of thinking in terms of features and functionality.  Apple will likely set Gatekeeper to Mac App Store only by default within the next release or two of Mac OS X.  Users will be able to change it, of course, but it will still have the desired effect of making publishers feel like they have to sell through the App Store and give up 30% of their revenue to Apple (and also abandon many of their pricing models since the App Store doesn&#x27;t support variable upgrade pricing, unfortunately).<p>Most Apple users won&#x27;t even know they can get apps outside of the App Store at that point, similar to how most Android users don&#x27;t know.  Similarly to Android, of course, there will be some power users that know and make use of that feature.  Most Mac OS X users will be completely unaware of the fact that any of this happened or that their options have been limited, though, the same way most iOS users are unaware Apple prohibits third party browsers (unless they&#x27;re just a skin on hobbled Mobile Safari), SMS clients, etc.<p>Personally, I disagree with the path Apple has forged the last few years.  They make pretty good hardware and were the first company that really &#x27;got&#x27; mobile music (and the fact that it needed good hardware and software - both on the device and the connecting PC).  I have an original iPod Mini I got and later hacked a 16GB CF card into and ran Busybox on.  I even have an old Mac Classic sitting in the closet that I&#x27;ll pull out and put shufflepuck on at some point.  But I likely won&#x27;t buy anything from Apple ever again at this point.  And I won&#x27;t develop anything for a platform whose owner operates the way and has the level of control that Apple does.  Both of which make me a bit sad.<p>Glad you like PortableApps.com and it&#x27;s helped you out.  We&#x27;re still chugging along.  If you&#x27;re so inclined, give it an install to your cloud drive (Dropbox, SkyDrive, Google Drive, etc) and you can run your apps from there and sync them among your Windows machines.  You can even run them under Wine on *nix or one of the Wine equivalents on Mac (CrossOver, Wineskin, WineBottler, PlayOnMac).",1386778168

6888307,comment,6887689,6887939,6,0,kyboren,,,"Agreed.  As I wrote in another thread:<p>> I also do not think their claims of Tor subversion hold water. From what I understand of Tor, directory information (including nodes&#x27; key fingerprints) is ultimately verified by the hard-coded keys of very few &quot;trusted&quot; operators of authoritative directory servers. So long as the Tor software isn&#x27;t compromised, no MITM, <i>regardless of where it&#x27;s effected</i>, will be able to subvert the user&#x27;s circuit construction (of course, barring bugs in Tor and exploits higher up in the software stack). At least, that&#x27;s my understanding.<p>However, I do assume they are very interested in capturing both short-term directory signing keys and the long-term keys which verify those short-term keys.  This means the Tor servers listed as &quot;dirservers&quot; in src/or/confic.c, but especially the nodes tor26, dizum, Tonga, gabelmoo, maatuska, dannenberg, and Faravahar, as they appear located outside the US and so probably &quot;game on&quot; for NSA.  I also assume NSA&#x27;s &quot;partners&quot; will try the same with those authoritative directory servers in the US, which NSA would undoubtedly use to enhance their capabilities.  Those who run authoritative directory servers need to be very careful (<i>cough</i> Appelbaum <i>cough</i>).<p>The paper&#x27;s main conclusion, &quot;NSA/GCHQ can surreptitiously selectively MITM users&#x27; Internet connections&quot;, appears to be valid (see FOXACID servers and NSA&#x27;s &quot;man-on-the-side&quot; attack), but this is a well-known threat model.<p>In my non-professional opinion, the most likely way NSA/GCHQ would attack Tor appear to be through:<p>1) Honeypot nodes -- Tor relays which act normally, but silently record timing and circuit routing information (&quot;circuit 2981: $253DFF1838A2B7782BE7735F74E50090D46CA1BC -> $1041213B53CCF586093BB65D9CC4BC0B9656EF17 @t=1386775503.00312&quot;)<p>2) &quot;Upstream&quot; data analysis of regular node connections -- build statistical models of likelihood of a client circuit routing from input node X to output node Y by observing timing of transmission rate bursts<p>3) CNE of non-US Tor nodes -- Pwn foreign nodes to turn regular nodes into honeypots<p>And so I wonder: it appears little can be done about 1) and 3) above what&#x27;s already being done (other than emphasizing to relay operators that Tor relays should be run on an isolated system with as few open services as possible).  Tor maintainers seem to see vulnerability to 2) as a fundamental problem with low-latency mixnets, and haven&#x27;t taken steps (AFAIK) to complicate that analysis.  Would it be effective to do something like the following?<p>1) Propagate relay-to-relay latency and jitter statistics along with client circuit data<p>2) Have each relay build a model of incoming latency and jitter statistics for each other relay<p>3) Associate each new client circuit on a relay with a latency and jitter bin selected uniformly at random from the models built in 2), excluding the model associated with the true incoming relay<p>4) Delay all packets in that circuit by the associated latency time, +/- jitter calculated from a probability distribution created in the associated model of 2)<p>This might be in combination with a change that removes or smooths bandwidth spikes by inserting dummy traffic between relays.<p>With both strategies, a) latency would be worse, and b) total available bandwidth would be lower.  It looks like there&#x27;s considerably more advertised bandwidth than there is used bandwidth, so b) might be OK.  But a) might be a big problem for usability.<p>One more harebrained scheme: have each relay pick a few &#x27;buddy&#x27; relays whose total advertised available buddy bandwidth sums to ~50% of this relay&#x27;s estimated bandwidth.  For each new client circuit, flip a coin and determine whether this circuit&#x27;s traffic will be forwarded directly, or given to a buddy to forward.  Similarly, the buddies each do the same with this relay.  Associate &#x27;chosen&#x27; client circuits with a buddy that tends to make a symmetric and smooth bi-directional data flow between the buddies.<p>OK, stream of consciousness over...  I really got off on a tangent.  I&#x27;m very interested to see why my lame schemes won&#x27;t work, so please point out why I&#x27;m wrong (as I assume I probably am) :).",1386778088

S/he will also ensure there is an alignment b/w the organization&#x27;s high level strategies and the individual contributions being made.<p>Yep, this. I work in a place that after a merger got rid of the creative director and replaced it with an &quot;everyone is senior&quot; approach. While it&#x27;s nice on paper, we have no accountability, no one to set or drive standards, and no review process other than client sign-off. I think we would benefit greatly from a Director or VP or some sort of management that could authoritatively say &quot;this is what we&#x27;re doing and this is how we&#x27;re doing it&quot;.",1386777714

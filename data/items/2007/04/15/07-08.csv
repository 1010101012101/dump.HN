13063,comment,13047,13047,0,0,celoyd,,,"Documentaries for geeks or about geeks? The ones about geeks will probably be really boring. They'll leave out both the technical stuff and the potentially actionable war stories. ""Revolution OS"", for instance, was a well-crafted film, but pretty dull if you read Slashdot.<p>Branch out a bit. Off the top of my head:<p>""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"": Richard Feynman talks. (Danny Hillis pops up for a bit.)<p>""The Fog of War"": a smart, reflective person discusses how he presided over a huge disaster.<p>""Lost in La Mancha"": Terry Gilliam takes a bunch of risks to get a movie started and doesn't make it.<p>""Around Cape Horn"": Captain Irving Johnson describes sailing around the Horn on one of the last windjammers.<p>""Walking with Dinosaurs"": Woo! Dinosaurs!<p>""Apollo 13"" is not an actual documentary, of course, but it's fun and reasonably faithful for a big-budget movie.",1176621887

But I'm just wondering: Are you as afraid of communism as to act as someone like Hitler would do? Your way of refusing to friendly discuss arguments is as intolerant and shortsighted as Hitler or Stalin would do. So, as you call yourself an anti-communist you just let me one person to compare you with...<p>I'm not a philosopher nor a politician but the way you talk answers one of the unsolved questions I asked myself while reading some historical books: are there still people like that?????<p>And there you are.....",1176621534

We're with you on the blogging - it's a big part of writewith, but we're making a tool that's useful any time you're working on something with other people.<p>The stuff you found underwhelming is mostly near the top of our to-do list, but hearing what people want definitely helps us prioritize.<p>I'm not sure I understand what you mean about privacy details. We actually do let you delete your documents, if you go to the home page, and nobody can see what's happening in a document unless you invite them in. If there are other privacy features you want, we'd love to hear about it (get us at honchos@writewith.com)<p>Oh, and we do try to extract titles, but we might be missing some. If you're comfortable sending us a document where that didn't work, we'll take a look.",1176620511

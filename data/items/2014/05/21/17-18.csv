For weeks, I had no idea what was going on. I just plain did not understand algebra whatsoever. But finally, at the end of a lab class where we actually mixed things and then found the concentrations and volumes, I finally figured out that these algebraic equations actually tied back into the real world. This was not for lack of trying on my part, my teacher&#x27;s part, or the schools. I just plain did not understand. I think it was a developmental issue for me. I wasn&#x27;t ready to chemo-mentally, therefore I just muddeled along frustrating everyone including myself.<p>I say this because I went on to get a BS in physics from a UC. Obviously I learned math very well later on. But in 9th grade, I was unable to learn anything harder than long division. I was a &#x27;left-behind&#x27; child due to my brain.

7779659,comment,7779100,7779100,7,0,candybar,,,"As a casual poker player, I find this line of reasoning specious.  Sports betting, blackjack and even roulette with a biased wheel are all games of skill by this definition.  Poker games are designed specifically to appeal to our gambling instinct so that better players can play the house while worse players gamble away their chips.  It&#x27;s true that from the perspective of the best players, it&#x27;s not truly gambling, but they are not the ones gambling laws are written to protect.  This isn&#x27;t too different from a casino owner saying - I&#x27;m not gambling, I make money every day.  You may not be gambling but your customers are.  The same is true of poker - even if you&#x27;re not gambling, your opponents are.<p>Edit: Will downvoters explain their reasoning?  Btw, someone else said something about how poker is a game of luck at low skill level and game of chance at high skill level but that&#x27;s not really how it works.  Poker is a game of skill if you&#x27;re playing against bad players because the game is consistently beatable with sufficient skills.  The better and more sound your opponents become, not just relative to you but on an absolute basis, the more important the role of luck becomes.",1400694686

However, confirmation is only half of science.<p>Before the confirmation stage, there should always be exploration, and that&#x27;s what this study represents.  &quot;Let&#x27;s put cannabis users in an MRI and see what happens!&quot;  It&#x27;s impossible to draw conclusions from exploratory research in the same way we do from confirmatory research.  The main problem is that there&#x27;s usually no hypothesis, nothing to falsify, and therefore no statistical test exists to help sift through the results.<p>However, significance testing can still suggest whether an exploratory finding is deviant. If one group mean is different from another group mean, it&#x27;s totally fair to report that difference.  I didn&#x27;t have to dig too deep into the original article to find out the authors weren&#x27;t making any outrageous claims.  It&#x27;s merely that journalists reported the exploratory results as if they were the generated by a confirmatory, falsifiable hypothesis.  In fact, the scientists were just reporting an interesting difference they observed.<p>Anyway, the point is not that the study should not have been published at all.  The study was fine, the work is valuable, and the reporting was overzealous/misinformed.<p>Edit: updating to add that the scientists did have some ideas about what kinds of differences they were expecting, consistent with animal models.  I might venture to say they had some clearly falsifiable hypotheses, too.  The science is fine, and so are the scientists.  It&#x27;s the reporting that is the problem.",1400694311

Is there anything in particular that you found confusing, inappropriate, or overly prescriptive?<p>For example, in Grade 7, there are about 50 requirements, one of which is “Use proportional relationships to solve multistep ratio and percent problems. Examples: simple interest, tax, markups and markdowns, gratuities and commissions, fees, percent increase and decrease, percent error.” That sounds like an appropriate thing to learn in 7th grade.<p>Edit: In fact, most of the time when I am reading the standard I just nod and think “yep, that’s probably about when I learned that concept” when I grew up in California, although in a few cases (e.g. using scatterplots and proving Pythagorean theorem in 8th grade) I don’t think I learned them until high school.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.corestandards.org/Math/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corestandards.org/Math/</a>",1400693800

Everyone tries to make the best possible deal for themselves, not just politicians.<p>> For that matter, why is the city in the business of trying to make a profit out of peoples&#x27; pensions?<p>For a multitude of possible reasons. Because the profit there can be used to reduce the tax rates. Because the profit can be used to pay for something that the city couldn&#x27;t otherwise afford. Because the benefits plan allows them to more accurately plan future liabilities (compared to paying employees a market rate salary (that&#x27;s not otherwise lowered by a pension) that floats up and down with inflation and the economy).<p>> And even then there was no accountability or repercussions for politicians that decided to dip their fingers into the pension investment pools.<p>Are you talking about embezzlement or about the city borrowing money from the pension fund? The first is illegal and an enforcement problem that&#x27;s pretty unrelated to where the money was embezzled from. The second may or may not actually be a problem depending on the terms at which the city borrows the money. Regardless, that&#x27;s also not related to pensions specifically, since the city can borrow money at stupid terms from anyone, not just the pension fund.<p>> I think the reason why most people are shocked at this article, is because they&#x27;ve been conditioned and drilled with the thought that public servants are under-paid.<p>That&#x27;s because the public workers actually were underpaid compared to private industry workers when the deals were originally negotiated (even including the expected value of the pension). Over the years since then, private corporations have lowered the salaries they pay (usually by not keeping up with inflation as opposed to actual pay cuts, though that happens, too) most of their workers, so public sector jobs have become much more competitive.<p>> If [the public servants did this on &quot;purpose&quot; as a risk-mitigating process]&#x27;s the case, then they need to stop yapping incessantly in the public sphere about how they&#x27;re paid less in comparison to their private counterparts.<p>I have a few problems with many of the implicit assumptions in this statement; specifically that there is an agreed upon way to value a pension, that there is an agreed upon way to value the value of the risk-mitigation of a pension plan, that there is little variation in the ratio of the total compensation public workers earn to a market rate salary across all government workers, that all government workers are yapping incessantly about being paid less than market rate when using total compensation instead of just salary (combined with the previous assumption: as opposed to just the ones that are currently underpaid), and that only the workers are benefiting (or that they benefit much more than the city) from such a deal.<p>On a side note, it&#x27;s disappointing to see people want to drag the public sector workers down to a their (possibly only just perceived) lower level instead of wanting to drag themselves up to the public sector workers&#x27; level.",1400693078

I&#x27;m also considering only the parts of Burp that are valuable for developers in general; things like stored attack vectors, like Nikto uses, are generally verboten on our team anyways.<p>So, if you asked me what the hard parts of getting Burp right when I took a stab at replacing it in Cocoa, and more recently in ko.js and Riak (more successfully):<p>* There is just a whole lot of UI involved in making a navigable proxy with the breakdowns you want, and, in particular, with editing and annotating raw requests and having those views do the &quot;right thing&quot; as the user edits the request and flips back and forth between views.<p>* Storage of requests is hard, because it&#x27;s not intuitive how they need to be stored. The proxy wants long-term storage with indexes; the repeater wants rapid writes; the fuzzer wants to generate a shitload of requests (multiplying one request by 20k isn&#x27;t rare), and a request from one part of the system can bounce through all the other parts.<p>* The proxy wants realtime communication/control with the UI, because some of your requests need to be intercepted and modified before delivery; in Burp, that UI shares most of the controls of the Repeater, which is surprisingly complicated.<p>Network performance is the <i>easiest</i> part of this to get right. Just don&#x27;t use Java threads, and use a real timer library. But getting the network performance to cooperate with persistent storage is harder, unless you just let storage and memory explode.<p>We wanted fine-grained control over all of the tools so that we could automate retesting and regression. Like I said, we had a lot of luck hoisting the components of Burp into a series of web applications and backend systems backed by Riak (and Postgres, for search, index, and UI). We replaced Intruder with a command-line tool written in Golang that has a small specification language for the rules, instead of Burp&#x27;s clunky interface, but there&#x27;s still a whole lot of UI involved in parsing a request, automatically finding the places to template-ize, and then allowing the user to alter those selections.<p>When I took my stab at doing this in Cocoa a few years ago, I made a beeline for NSWebView; having a real webkit render is an enormous win. We do something similar to you with headless webkit now. This is a place Burp is genuinely constrained, due to Java.<p>Unfortunately, replacing Burp is a bitch.",1400692461

And we&#x27;re never going to arrive at a solution that everyone enjoys or thinks fair if we continue to chant internet activist slogans.<p>In 1997, peering worked because we need a simple solution whereby dozens of private companies could hook their networks together without going through the complicated accounting of who owed who how much. Most networks sent as much as they received, there was little point in nitpicking the slight differences.<p>In 2014, this may not be the case. Level3 wants to send much more traffic to Comcast than Comcast would ever send to Level3. This is because Netflix (a Level3 customer) is asymmetric in nature.<p>Why is Comcast obligated to do this for free? Comcast doesn&#x27;t offer its customers &quot;Netflix service&quot;. Indeed, if it did, people would go crazy screaming net neutrality slogans. Comcast offers internet service, and they don&#x27;t guarantee access to Netflix <i>especially</i> when Netflix doesn&#x27;t bother to acquire sufficient network connectivity.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean Netflix is evil. It doesn&#x27;t mean that Comcast is anything other than evil.<p>But Comcast does feel cheated if they&#x27;re forced to pay for the upgrades, and Netflix feels cheated if they&#x27;re forced to pay for the upgrades (even though they are the ones who benefit from this).<p>This means that peering in general may not work anymore. That is the real problem that no one seems smart enough to address. And if it does not work, what replaces it?<p>So if you&#x27;re suggesting Wheeler isn&#x27;t smart enough to fix it... well, that sort of figures.<p>> Just reclassify broadband as a &#x27;telecommunications service&#x27; already.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t really fix anything though.

I analyze college football data sets and can determine where they came from, so I have no doubt that companies can as well.<p>If you have enough data sources you could theoretically recreate a play by play from all of them and have a data set that would be difficult to prove was stolen from someplace in particular.

Or nutritional stuff like MyFitnessPal.<p>For the marketing, I&#x27;d say:<p>* The app ends up being a demo because of the restriction on number of runs, while the competitors offer something fully functional, including Vima&#x27;s paid features, for free. Is this going to work?<p>* The name is probably bad - take it from the guy who likes greek mythology for names. If it&#x27;s a running app, you might as well say so. Runtastic, Runkeeper, MapMyRun - there&#x27;s a theme here.<p>* I don&#x27;t see any way I can join the community, so Vima can email me later and follow up to see why I&#x27;m not using the app after I downloaded it.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about making a fitness app, and I have some infrastructure such that I can get to market with a more feature-complete product than Vima, in just a few weeks. It&#x27;s a big brawl to walk into though.",1400691641

This is fraught, of course.<p>CocoaPods also functions as a discovery engine. The experience is very unpolished, but it will surface the code that other people have written with the explicit intention of offering as a library to other people. Which is a subset of &quot;code other people have released on github&quot;, obviously.<p>I&#x27;m a skeptic too. I&#x27;ve played with it, but requiring a couple dozen additional ruby gems and editing my Xcode project files underneath me creeps me out, so I won&#x27;t use it for personal or client work.<p>I&#x27;ve been hired into existing projects that used it though, and it works fine as long as you manage it as a glorified drag-n-drop. You can blow yourself up if you trust it like a vendor-approved auto-upgrade mechanism. That&#x27;s as much a factor of the ecosystem as the tool, and I hope Pods and Pod authors will coalesce around a level of maturity that&#x27;s useful in shipping code environments.",1400691641

So for practical purposes d could become a constant in a given implementation. Compare that to other efficient algorithms (like merge sort) that are O(n log(n)).

I got so used to not being there, working full time while going to school, that, when school ended, I didn&#x27;t stop &quot;not being there&quot;. Whether it was working late hours or traveling a lot, I missed <i>a lot</i>, and I do regret it.<p>My kids are all teens moving into 20s now. I work a job whose primary feature is working at home (the job is fine, but I do it to be home) so I can soak up some last time with them before they are out of the house. I now get to hear about crushes and new-found independence.<p>But, if I could do it again, I wouldn&#x27;t make the mistake. There is time for all the things after your kids are older. If you are in a situation where you have to be gone to provide a roof, and there is no other way, have no guilt; but if you have the option, your future self and your kids will thank you for being there.",1400691605

Anyway, I like the general ideas he presents, but I think that his film and casino project stories would have been really different if rather than sending something that had all the technical guts in place, they sent something flashy which still needed plumbing work.<p>In the case of the movie, this could have been 10 minutes of awesomeness.<p>In the case of the casino thing, this could have been a cheapo flash demo made by some uber-designer, with a lot of handwaving on the back-end.<p>Both of these would have yielded better results than showing real state of the projects.<p>I guess I believe that nobody cares about plumbing except plumbers / engineers. Unless engineers are going to buy your product (and they'll still likely have to demo it for a non-engineer to get a purchase okay), I think it makes a huge amount of sense to aim for some initial flash.<p>Probably nobody needs this advice more than me, so I'm going to read it back to myself every day for a week in the hopes that it will stick..",1258995563

Language is extremely slippery. I agree that going to the edges can be awful if done poorly, but if somebody says something like ""I'm a utilitarian"" I think it's perfectly honest and respectful to ask something like ""Does that mean you would sacrifice a million people to give humanity an additional ten years of lifespan?""<p>Because sometimes ""utilitarian"" means that and sometimes it doesn't. Utilitarian is just a label, and labels don't in themselves have a lot of meaning. Words only have context when related to other words -- this is why every honest web discussion usually ends with a discussion in terms. Unless you explore the extremes you really have no idea what the other person is saying.<p>Godwin's law is awesome, but just like Occam's Razor, it has it's limits.

If Apple is very paranoid and must approve every single app, then it should rightly take the blame.<p>2. If Apple says it's free for all and users should realize that some apps are not that great, then it would rightly remove any blame thrown its way.<p>Which is why I think the whole app approval process is absurd: Apple should stop approving apps and remove any associated blame. The path it's on right now is never going to scale or end well for Apple - all it would take is one bad slip and it's pretty much over.<p>On the flip side is what Google does with Android: they're collecting tons of feedback every time someone uninstalls an app, including an option that says ""this is a malicious app"". Care to wager that this will be used in some kind of automated way to keep the app store clean?<p>Not just that, they're empowering the user to make an informed decision. The Android app store tells you how many downloads the app gets, its star rating (out of 5 stars) and user comments. Before installing any app I read all this info and decide ""hey, with 10,000 downloads and 4.5 stars, how bad can it be?""<p>But then one more thing happens: the app store tells you what the application requests permission to do like access your location or full internet access or whatnot.

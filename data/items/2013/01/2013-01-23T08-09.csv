5102168,comment,5101318,5101318,7,0,antoncohen,,,"To address the comments about client-side JavaScript encryption being insecure, client-side JavaScript isn't inherently insecure, or rather security is entirely dependent on the threat vectors you are trying to protect against. Some examples of levels of security:<p>SSL/TLS: Without transport level security (SSL/TLS), and no other encryption, it is absolutely trivial to intercept data. Unsecured WiFi, malicious network operators, hacked middlemen, spoofed DNS; there are many threat vectors. Adding SSL/TLS significantly increases security.<p>Server-side encryption: Added server-side encryption to SSL/TLS marginally increases security. It actually doesn't protect from much. Disposal of the hard drives is a common one people cite, in case HDDs aren't wiped when sent to the junk yard or for RMA. It could also protect against some accidental data leaks if files become readable through unintended means, or if the server is actually hosting the files in a third-party service (e.g., CDN, S3). It doesn't protect from employees of the server host, and it does little to protect from hackers that get full server access as the decryption key is likely stored in a file on the server.<p>Client-side JavaScript: JavaScript encryption actually adds a reasonable amount of security. Yes, you have to trust the browser makers, the browser update mechanism, and the company hosting the service (they could always change the JavaScript to steal your password). It does make it less trivial for a malicious employee to access your data, they would have to write and deploy new JavaScript. It also makes it less trivial for a hacker that gains server access, they would have to modify the JavaScript too. Modifying the JS is feasible for a targeted attack. It also protects against offline attacks, where a hacker copies data to their own systems to analyze before they get detected.<p>I think you have to trust the browser makers and their update mechanisms. The browsers always have access to everything, they could be capturing your banking passwords, or insert dummy SSL CAs, they could do anything. You also have to trust the makers of client software, whether it's JavaScript in the browser or C on the command-line, very few people are going to check the source code, most people will accept whatever client updates are provided.<p>Where client-side JavaScript falls apart is that it is vulnerable to some of the most common security exploits. Namely random browser vulnerabilities, XSS attacks, and malicious or vulnerable browser extensions and plugins. People are far too willing to install or unwittingly install (thanks InstallMonetizer) browser extensions and plug-ins which have too much access to your browser data. But your bank account is also vulnerable to the same issues. So while you shouldn't use client-side JavaScript to protect Top Secret government information, it does provide a decent amount of security, and is probably good enough for most cloud storage solutions.",1358930970

It is frowned upon the same way as ""talking about your salary"" is frowned upon, and usually for the same reason: it leads to increased leverage for employees. By creating fictitious mores around these two activities, employees have less of an understanding of how well or badly they are being treated (less insight into the market for their talents). If you are making twice as much as me because I am a better negotiator, you may continue without a fuss for years if you never find out. Creating a culture about not talking about your salary is thus highly valuable to an employer. Similarly, if I am a <i>good</i> employee and too distracted by working, I may never realize that the going salary for a company is now X times what I make. Another company contacting me may make me aware of this, and thus it is equally beneficial to attach false stigma to this practice.

I don't know if I can go see family without losing my job as I found all this out during my week of vacation off from work and now cannot take any more without scheduling it. I need to get out of here, I hope my boss understands it. Maybe I can work remotely. I hate KY now, it has been nothing but a curse. Once we moved down here she met men. That is where it went downhill because all of a sudden I was stomped on by this hatred. Hatred that made no sense until I found out that she cheated on me when she left her facebook open. Yes I was curious. Was I wrong? No... Did I know her password? No... Once i found out it hit, all she could care about was my car keys. What kind of person is this? Is Monogamy real? I doubt it. Wish it was. If I talked to a professional, I would be labeled and I don't want to do that. I may need it though the more and more I think about it. Of course I could make half of the money developing software up in Ohio, but that is a choice I am currently considering. I have no friends down here, no close friends since she came into my life.

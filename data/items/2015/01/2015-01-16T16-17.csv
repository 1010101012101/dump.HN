I have been doing it for around two month.<p>What i am experiencing in observing this are mainly good things, which are:<p>- I can controll my eating habits into a good systematic way, in sahoor and iftar. Before I would eat regardless of time or my hunger level, it is just difficult for me to moderate myself.<p>- My state of mind seems improved quite a lot. I am more aware of my self, my being, my hunger, and many other aspects in my life.<p>- I can taste food a lot more better, before I would just stuff anything as long as it is there. After I got used to the fasting, I am more selective of what I eat and enjoy each bite with great gratefulness.<p>Of course there are several times that are difficult for me when I am doing it. But they are far out weighted by the better things.<p>This is based on my own experiences and they may differ with other people&#x27;s.",1421427442

8900046,comment,8899025,8899537,0,0,zero_iq,,,"The vans are simply for awareness and transport for the investigators who visit a percentage of addresses that do not have a licence.<p>Here is a TV Licencing employee admitting as much: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg5t4jVBemE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg5t4jVBemE</a><p>The backs of the vans are empty, and are sometimes parked in prominent places with a lot of passing pedestrian or vehicle traffic, e.g. supermarket car parks, as a reminder/scare-tactic for people to buy a licence, in locations where TV licence evasion is suspected.<p>This is how TV detection works:<p>1. TV Licencing (actually the BBC, see below) maintain a database of every address in the UK, compiled from various sources.<p>2. The vast majority of addresses are covered by a TV licence, because, seriously, who hasn&#x27;t got a TV.<p>3. The remaining addresses without a licence may be randomly select for investigation (&#x27;detection&#x27;), and an investigator sent to the address in a &#x27;detector van&#x27; (just used for transport), or may be selected on the basis of &#x27;intelligence&#x27;, i.e. snitching neighbours, disgruntled employees, etc.<p>4. If the address doesn&#x27;t qualify for a TV licence, e.g. non-permanent resident of a static caravan or other extenuating circumstances, then the address details are amended as such in the database.<p>5. If the address would normally qualify for a licence, then the &#x27;detector&#x27; (human investigator) will see if there is evidence of watching TV, and may knock on the door to talk to the occupants.<p>6. At this point, TV Licencing can, if satisfied, mark the address as (temporarily) not requiring a TV licence, or pursue further action, e.g. legal action. Periodically, the address will be sent letters reminding them that they don&#x27;t have a licence, and should probably get one, regardless.<p>No &#x27;electronic detection&#x27; equipment is used, other than laptops and PDA-type devices that have access to the address database, or portions of it. These are the rumoured &#x27;handheld detectors&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s it. All the detection equipment rumours are just that: scare-mongering tactics by the BBC.<p>&quot;TV Licencing&quot; itself is maintained as a brand distinct from the BBC to avoid tarnishing the image of the BBC&#x27;s main brand with such rumours of snooping, scare-tactics, etc.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the BBC itself has not actually used any RIPA powers, but is just spreading the rumour that it has done so. Hence the vagueness of the report.",1421427407

Great job!<p>Since I&#x27;m an programmer who&#x27;s an aspiring artist, I have a few questions:<p>1. <i>Is there a way to turn off additive brush-layering (ie the opacity does not change when you stroke over the same place)[1]?</i> I am used to Krita and Photoshop having an option to toggle this. The only way when the opacity increases is when the pressure increases.<p>2. <i>Is there a way to create custom brushes?</i> I&#x27;d love to be able to create my own. Also, Krita has some nice ways of &quot;scripting&quot; brushes which was nifty. The current ones are more than fine, but I usually make certain &quot;helper&quot; brushes to speed things up a little.<p>3. <i>Do you plan to open-source certain parts of Leonardo?</i> It&#x27;d be great if you open-sourced the specification for .leo and, the brush format, so it&#x27;s easier to create conversion tools. I&#x27;m not a marketing expert, but I imagine having the ability to import brushes from Photoshop would be a <i>huge</i> benefit.<p>4. <i>Do you intend to support plugins?</i><p>---

8900029,comment,8898341,8898738,0,0,HardDaysKnight,,,"I&#x27;ve played tournament chess for a few years. In fact, I&#x27;ll be playing in a chess tournament this weekend. I&#x27;ve lost lot of games. The effect, I think, has been an increased ability to handle failure, rejection, and frustration in other areas of life. How one gets better at chess is a subject of intense interest among chess players. Of course, one has to learn opening principles, positional ideas, endgame technique, tactics, and more. However, I think there is also a psychological change that must happen. A transformation in how one views the game. Generally, I think it happens this way. A tournament player eventually realizes that the game is (most likely) a theoretical draw. Nobody can win a game by force. Every loss is the result of your own mistakes. Coming to that realization the chess player stops trying to force wins from unclear positions, stops mentally calculating long and wild variations that eat up time on the clock, and in truth will never appear on the board (and are full of errors anyway), and instead begins to focus on his opponents (perhaps subtle) errors. He begins to accumulate small advantages. In short, he lets the other player beat himself. Of course, it&#x27;s all easier said than done.",1421427234

But my current students still love 80&#x27;s metal bands like Metallica and Slayer, and 80&#x27;s hip hop like NWA and others. They like 80&#x27;s movies, and will have quote battles about 80&#x27;s movies.<p>Maybe 1985 doesn&#x27;t feel as far away to them, or as irrelevant, as 1955 felt to me.",1421426450

When they don&#x27;t want attention, they dress casually.  It&#x27;s just like birds.  Ever wonder why they call it the birds and the bees?  If you&#x27;re a guy and you hit on women in sweatpants, you&#x27;ll most likely fail, b/c those women are not signalling their availability and interest.<p>And before someone goes all &quot;women should be able to dress however they want and not get raped,&quot; consider that I&#x27;m not advocating rape.  I&#x27;m pointing out that the previous poster asked &quot;attractive&quot; women for their phone numbers, not every woman.  Logically, this implies that he was asking women who were seeking attraction by dressing attractively and presenting themselves as available and seeking mates, just like birds who sing to signal their availability.<p>The reason everyone confuses attractiveness is that our media present it as a thing that you have or don&#x27;t.  &quot;Movie stars have it, computer nerds don&#x27;t.&quot;  But the real truth is that attractiveness is something you <i>do</i>.  When you want to &quot;get out there,&quot; to signal your availability and interest in mating, you <i>do</i> attractiveness.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how fat or pimply you are:  You adorn yourself, you clean yourself, wear fancy clothes, you grab attention, you impress people, try hairstyles.  Once you&#x27;re married, reproducing, dropping kids off in a minivan on Saturday morning, you wear sweatpants and other casual clothes and no one (except social retards, of which there are unfortunately plenty) hits on you.  Or else if you miss that egoistic feeling of being attractive, you dress up a little bit and reject all the people that hit on you.<p>This is how it works.  It&#x27;s just one step advanced from non-speaking mammals.  Political correctness is just an attempt to cover up the realities that not everyone understands, just like religion and the Republican party are shorthand behaviors/scripts for people to follow when they don&#x27;t know exactly what to do.",1421425559

For one of my graduate classes, I built a game where two people (a liar and a truth teller) would try to convince a third person (the judge) they had experienced something. The goal was to see if people used different language when lying than they did when telling the truth. It was a fun project and we were focused more on the NLP/ML side of things. Turns out to be reasonably possible to separate our ~500 examples via a linear SVM, with some interesting separating words. That&#x27;s where our claims stopped.<p>Then I took the results to a psychology prof. They loaded the data into SAS or something and it proceeded to perform HUNDREDS of independent t-tests. The results came out in a few seconds and the professor exclaimed &quot;Oh look! Pronouns are statistically significant! Oh and possessive nouns too!&quot; -- I cringed.<p>The flip side of this is that as statisticians, we <i>do</i> know how to handle different kinds of testing. If you&#x27;re going to be looking at all these different outcomes, that&#x27;s fine, but you just need to correct for it. We&#x27;ve had Bonferroni correction since the 1960s; Benjamini-Hochberg and related false discovery rate methods have been around for almost 20 years now. In fact, there are even situations where the data can help define a prior for your hypothesis testing [1].<p>Lastly, there is this quote from the article:<p>> There is no statistical quality board that could enforce such larger analyses—nor would we believe such coercion to be appropriate<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s such a bad idea. In theory, that should be the job of the journal reviewers and editor. In practice, it&#x27;s often the blind leading the blind, with confirmation bias thrown in to boot.

Instead of forcing people to eat breakfast or not eat breakfast, it studies about 4,000 people and their daily habits.  Some anecdotal takeaways is that people who eat breakfast are more likely to exercise, and women who eat breakfast typically eat less calories in a day.

The Chromium team subsequently <i>removed the code for DNSSEC validation</i>, and has since then declared that they&#x27;re not moving forward with DNSSEC. The Bugzilla ticket for DANE support in Firefox features a member of the Mozilla team declaring that DANE support is no longer an active project there.",1421424206

Those women did not choose to participate in SeanDav&#x27;s practice, and it was not cost-free to them to be used and discarded that way.<p>More to brazzy&#x27;s point, SeanDav doesn&#x27;t get to decide how he comes across to people. Pretty young women get hit on <i>constantly</i> and it is really exhausting and demoralizing to be rudely interrupted every five minutes while out in public, by people who pretend to be friendly but clearly have ulterior motives. The girl - who was, by definition, interrupted for the umpteenth time that day - likely considered the interruption unpleasant and at least somewhat creepy. Withdrawing &quot;if the situation becomes uncomfortable&quot; is taking it many, many steps too far and is frankly wishful thinking - people in general, and girls especially, are not socialized to tell people to f--ck off right away so by the time the situation is so uncomfortable that the girl actually asks you to leave her alone, it is way past discomfort for her.<p>Not to mention that if all you really want to do is practice free-throws, you don&#x27;t need to bust your way into the most elite basketball court to do it. Nothing wrong with practicing within your league. Why couldn&#x27;t he get phone numbers from unattractive girls, or boys?",1421424205

I just believed the hype.<p>EDIT:<p>The links you provided debunk the notion of weight loss being impacted... but health seems to still have some potential links.<p>&quot;The last point that Dhurandhar brings up is an important caveat: There are very good studies that suggest that skipping breakfast does influence our health in other meaningful ways. For instance, it’s well known to affect metabolism, since it forces the body to stay in a fasting state for a longer period of time. Last year, a study found that skipping breakfast was linked to coronary heart disease, presumably because the extra time fasting leads to a rise in a group of factors that together increase heart risk. “Prolonged fasting,” says study author Leah Cahill, “leads to increases in diastolic and systolic blood pressure, blood concentrations of insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids and LDL-cholesterol, and to decreases in blood concentrations of HDL-cholesterol.”&quot;",1421424105

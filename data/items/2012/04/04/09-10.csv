3796856,comment,3796378,3796577,4,0,chmike,,,"AFIK ARM processors don't support misaligned word access. \nAFIK misaligned word access is twice slower than aligned word access (requires 2 reads). So I don't understand ""offers it for free"". But this is still twice faster than the example code. Note that endianess and word alignment are two distinct problems.<p>The point made by the author addresses this issue from a different angle.<p>As the author say, programmers should always write endianess neutral code unless it is impossible which is generally at the interfaces, where data is read and written (I/O) by the program. If the code is correctly and intelligently optimized so that marshaling is done once, then the byte swapping may generally be expected to be a low frequency operation. In this case the most simple and portable code should be favored.<p>Trying to optimize this operation by word read and byte swapping provides an insignificant optimization with a higher cost on code portability and maintainability. The author is right on this.<p>Though it is also true that in some cases, the operation frequency is very high (i.e. reading million pixel values of an image). For these use cases, the programming overhead of using highly optimized code is perfectly justified. But then don't use half backed optimizations. Try to align data on words (twice faster), read by word (four time faster) and use byte swapping machine instruction available on the target CPU instead of the proposed shifts and bit masks.<p>My opinion is that good languages should provide optimized data marshaling functions in their library so that the code can be optimal and portable at the same time.",1333533161

In my opinion there are two reasons why too much optimization in this is complete waste of time:<p>1) Even if compilers are not able to optimize manual conversion of integer to/from discrete bytes into same code as word sized access with optional byte order swap, it's mostly irrelevant, as there aren't going to be any significant difference in performance between one four byte access and four one byte accesses (as in both cases you end up with same number of actual memory transactions, which is the slow part, due to caches)<p>2) when you are handling portable binary representation of something, it's always connected to some IO, which is slow already so any performance boost that you get from microoptimalization like this is completely negligible.<p>I tend to just hand write few lines of C to pack/unpack integers explicitly when needed as it seems to me as the most productive thing you can do.<p>By the way all the big endian <-> little endian functions you propose boil down to two implementations for each size of operand: no-op and mirroring of all bytes, both of which are mostly trivial.<p>What is really missing is portable and efficient way to encode floating point numbers, as there is no portable way to find out their endianity and in floating point case it's more complex than just big vs. little endian.",1333532966

What I mean by this is that you may find the features of a new OS interesting enough to want to try it, but doing so actually will take some effort. If you procrastinate, you've still got the old OS.<p>Before Win95, the preinstalls were generally either DOS, or DOS + Win3.<p>When Win95 came out, it was an immediate hit via retail sales. On launch day, many stores were open at midnight to sell it as soon as they could, and people lined up to buy it. I don't have the numbers handy, but I'd be surprised if Win95 on the first day of availability did not surpass OS/2.<p>This shows that there was a significant number of people in August 1995 for whom an OS of Win95's level could entice them to want to try it sufficiently to get them to actually go out and buy it and install it.<p>If IBM had properly marketed OS/2, those people could have been their customers. IBM could have established themselves as the preferred 32-bit PC OS before Win95 got out of the gate, and vendors would have been rushing to sell preinstalled OS/2 systems.<p>One can make a good case that after Win95 came out and was getting preinstalls, no amount of effort by IBM could have overcome that--Win95 was good enough that OS/2's advantages probably were not enough to overcome procrastination.

Storing settings you would either set the variablename in the columnname and the value in a row, or create 2 columns (variable and value) and store variables in rows. Either way, the number of rows is constant. Not immediately a bad thing, but not ideal either.<p>There is also the lack of hierarchy this way, currently we have a filesystem-like path in use. The variable in the database will be something like ""/modules/twitter/username"". This is a custom system though, and it works but doesn't really feel right either. Unlike a table, files can be placed in the directory along with the right module (part of the application, they can be added or removed as needed).<p>Lastly a problem with a database is that you can use one table for all settings, or a new settings table for different modules. Using a single table, you would have to clean it up every time you add or delete a module. Using multiple tables, you get a long list of tables in the database, often to store only a few variables per application.<p>Settings files (ini, json, or another format) feel a lot more like how it should be done, but to open and parse a settings file every pageload seems not too great for performance either. Or even if it performed well enough, settings are something that can be loaded into the RAM and only written to the disk when changed. MySQL can keep file handles opened, doesn't use an interpreted language to read or write the data, and even caches stuff so there is often no disk interaction at all on reading.<p>So... what else could or should we use? NoSQL perhaps (I'm rather unfamiliar with that)? Or is there simply no optimal solution and should we continue to (ab)use the database for this?",1333530299

This is possible because demand vastly outstrips supply.<p>At least it's like that here in Germany - the broker fees for good apartments are almost always paid by tenants. Any apartment where this is not the case has probably major downsides. In other cities, where the supply/demand situation is different, broker fees are paid by the owners and the broker's added value is marketing (i.e. finding good tenants at all)",1348822460

Yes I know developing on microsoft API's (exspecialy anything associated with IE) has been a complete nightmare for many in the past including myself with many a fix being lamented as fixed in the next release only to find the next release entails you having to change other aspects as they are nolonger supported.  Thats true with anything were you touch a API outside your control, at least potentualy in one way or another.<p>If anything by not officialy certifying minecraft for win8 is doing no harm at all for microsoft as it probably runs fine as is and with the processing power nowadays HTML5 becomes more and more appealing to many as apposed to going native.<p>Is he right to make a stand, yes, it is his right and has to be respected, especialy as he is able to.  But personaly the more I look into win8 and metro aside I'm liking it for what it is, there again I'm the sick puppy who preferes vista over win7 and i'm sure no metro fan, but having explorer or an alternative desktop option is not going to be too hard.<p>Also worth noting that it will be hard to garner true win8 sales once its released as Microsoft have done alot of write off's last quarter (pulling some early like write off of the cost of pressing windows 8 and other gems) so the win8 release quarter can only look better however it does.  This with the cheap upgrade and less messing with versions (mini, lite, almost, profesional and ultra or whatever they were).  So for many it will be a fiscal no brainer, especialy all those XP installs becoming less supported (unless your a new intel chipset that support XP over Vista, bless).<p>Maybe Microsft will install a desktop chosser akin to the browser selection, at least that would plicate alot if they had a clear cut choice.<p>But anything that runs on a closed source OS in any form is gong to be limited, its if those limitations actualy matter that to what your doing is what realy counts and whilst I applaud Notch's stand I do wonder if later on he find some toys missing that needn't of fallen.

Until you test, you never know if there are problems with your ideas that never would have occurred to you no matter hard you thought about them, and that makes testing invaluable.<p>But sometimes some of the problems that testing would reveal, would also be revealed if you just thought and discussed your ideas more, and would cost vastly less time and effort (which is a very high bar when what you're testing is the efficacy of pedagogy for teaching people programming for the very first time). So presenting your ideas in a compelling way and opening up discussion can also be extremely valuable, and that's exactly what Bret Victor did.",1348820112

It's actually a bit like Android except Youview can push updates without even the manufacturers approval!<p>The rest of Europe has adopted HBBTV as a standard already and much of the world is adopting similar HTML based solutions if not HBBTV itself.<p>As it currently stands a hard disk is required and that is unlikely to be bundled into many TVs in the near future.  Spinning rust is too bulky, it adds cost.  Flash is too expensive still for the Youview minimum of 250MB (or is it even more than that).<p>For the major TV manufacturers the loss of control of the TV UI is a major issue and they are unlikely to do that unless they really have to.  For the UK alone it is very unlikely.  I'm surprised that some have gone the GoogleTV route to be honest but I think they were imagining it would take off like Android has.  Also going the Youview route removes their potential revenues from operating their on online platforms.<p>So for the above reasons Youview as it currently stands will not make any impact outside the UK (and it won't actually make much inside either) and won't make a major part of any TV manufacturers line up.",1348819705

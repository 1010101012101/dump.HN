There&#x27;s room for radical feminism, not for hate.<p>&quot;Male tears&quot; isn&#x27;t a radical feminist thing, many non-radical feminists use it. Actually, it&#x27;s quite the opposite, it&#x27;s men who have always said feminist women (radical or not) are anti-men, so they decided to play along and made a joke about it.<p>While I think &quot;male tears&quot; isn&#x27;t anti-men, I do think it could be against hegemonic masculinity, which is when men are told they have to be strong, non-emotional, etc; e.g. the past few days people have been talking about some research that implies that male gamers who harass women (i.e. they comply with hegemonic masculinty) are &quot;losers&quot;, and some people have talked about it using #maletears. There&#x27;s some anti-hegemonic masculinity Schadenfreude going on there. Some people think #maletears create a stigma around men who do cry, but it&#x27;s also the opposite, it&#x27;s joking about men who think they can&#x27;t cry, they should be allowed to cry if they want to.<p>About the #killallmen, I think it didn&#x27;t get traction where I live, in Brazil, I hadn&#x27;t heard about it. I&#x27;m not sure what is it about, but I can see how some feminist women would argue that men do assault and kill women every day, systematically, so it could be sarcastic. Also, as something that would instantly backfire, it could be an attempt to destroy feminism from within, but you see, any feminist with a basic understanding of gender theory would immediately see thru that: men are not all equal, just as women are not all equal. So, let&#x27;s say, if we&#x27;re killing all men, what do we do to trans women? See, it doesn&#x27;t work in a feminist framework.",1437764000

Fortunately, the overwhelming number of factory owners/GM&#x27;s are fundamentally decent people caught up in difficult circumstances.<p>Typical contracts are structured 30% deposit and 70% when it ships. Margins to the factory aren&#x27;t 70% so they wind up quite leveraged. Most of the scenarios I saw came out of the factory not understanding or executing on the customer requirements correctly. If they build units and the customer rejects them, they have to cover those material costs so they can repair or otherwise try again. This tremendous financial pressure causes otherwise good GM&#x27;s to cut corners every possible way they can to try to keep the lights on.<p>GetScale impacts worker treatment in several ways:<p>(1) it eliminates waste and errors that result from misunderstandings in customer acceptance procedures. After deploying us in a factory you just don&#x27;t encounter thousands of bad units because the factory is confirming against the exact acceptance procedure as you go (instead of build a lot, ship, customer receives and rejects).<p>(2) it is possible to audit your suppliers and if you do that, GetScale provides the ground truth of which workers were working at which stations when and for how long (down to the millisecond!). Since you have to login-logout to do any work our records are very accurate.<p>(3) it enables you to vote with your dollars. Without invasive monitoring (like GetScale) it is very difficult to determine which factories are &quot;good&quot; because reputation is easy to coopt and places like Alibaba can be bought. GetScale data collection is automatic and the data is held off-shore (in the US). We already see factories in China using GetScale as a selling point to foreign clients since it provides quantitative proof of their compliance and performance. A factory that is willing to be open about its performance and let you document workers on the line is the factory proud of its worker treatment, not the one trying to hide it.<p>As to studies, I have seen some in both the psychology of management literature and the manufacturing management literature, but as to specific citations I will need some time to dig them out of my research notes.<p>In any case, I hope I&#x27;ve answered your concerns.

But for a password generated using the secure random number generator, it is absolute unbreakable e.g.<p>No, that&#x27;s not accurate.  Bits of entropy are based on how many options you have for the type of password you used.  The password &quot;goodnight moon&quot; has <i>far</i> less than 120 bits of entropy.  A word-based password search algorithm would find it quite easily.  Those are easily both in the top few thousand words in the English language, so that password probably has less than 24 bits (2*lg(4096)) of entropy.<p>> 12.5 ASCII characters<p>That assumes 8-bit ASCII.  In practice, a password doesn&#x27;t include characters 127-255 or 0-31, only 32-126, and probably not many symbols.  One character selected randomly from characters 32-126 has ~6.6 bits of entropy.  One character selected randomly from just letters and numbers, no symbols, has ~6 bits of entropy.  One character selected randomly from just lowercase letters has ~4.7 bits of entropy.  And if you don&#x27;t choose randomly, and instead use a memorable password, then you reduce that entropy.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%...</a>",1437763712

9944270,comment,9943792,9943792,0,0,burnte,,,"This only highlights how the intention of copyright as put forth by the framers has been distorted through the lens of business. Book publishers thought libraries might be a threat to the &quot;modern&quot; publishing industry in the 1800s, just like the movie studios thought home video would kill movies. They were incorrect on both counts, however with the ease and low cost of digital copies, there actually IS a great deal of money to be made without actually doing more work by perpetuating the endless copyright. Given how money focused politicians are, and how much influence business plays with them, its not a difficult argument to make, especially when the argument is money versus the betterment of society and future creativity. One is easily measured now, the other is not easily measured, and only pays off on the scale of decades.<p>Disney took public domain stories, and made billions by creating their own versions, and now seek to prevent others from doing the same. The estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (who died 85 years ago this month) found only partial relief in the extension of the money machine, with stories and characters before 1923 now in the public domain, and stories after 1923 still under copyright 92 years later! Sherlock has become a huge influence not just in other creative works, but derivative works such as TV shows and movies that pay no royalty to the Doyle estate. Doyle himself was influence by other authors, such as Poe, as well as real people.<p>The intent of copyright was to give limited protection to the creators of creative works, because while society as a whole benefits from the arts, it can only occur if there is a benefit to the creators. So we gave them a limited monopoly, just like patents, to enjoy the fruits of their labors before they became part of society as a whole. Few artists want to create works that only a select few can enjoy, however the financial interest is in doing just that. Just as software patents threaten our industry (and patent abuse on the whole threatens many industries), copyright abuse threatens the enrichment of society as a whole. We do not own our children, we only raise them for a while and unleash them into the world. The same is true with art. That is the way it was meant to be.",1437763605

Freeswitch is the node of choice here, though we&#x27;re doing rather simple things with it so eventually we&#x27;ll probably replace this with something more homegrown.  Every vendor along those legs can listen in, just like normal POTS lines.  Until people get off the POTS system, this is just going to be reality.  Plans and plumbing are in place when viable to make this a strictly end-to-end pass-through fully encrypted service if you&#x27;re not going over POTS.  VoIP is pretty awesome stuff.<p>- Any vendor servicing the lines can listen in.  Unless the NSA has stopped, they&#x27;re definitely processing some of it.  If this is a concern, you really just don&#x27;t want a phone number at all.  I&#x27;d love to offer better privacy there, but it isn&#x27;t in anyone&#x27;s hands but users&#x27; really.<p>- No SLA for the consumer product yet.  We have a track record of no downtime outside our maintenance, but we&#x27;ve only been doing this for a few months so that&#x27;s easy.  That said, everything&#x27;s modular and I can replace any given piece with a new virtual server in under 10 minutes from start to finish.<p>- Redundancy in the web portion is there, redundancy in the database is there, redundancy in the VoIP level is sort of there, but if any node along your call chain goes down you&#x27;re going to lose that call and have to start it again.  This is yet another failing of voice communications in general, and not something we can do anything about.<p>- POTS quality is the best we (or anyone) can do.  No compression, just straight uLaw without processing so it&#x27;s as clear as can be expected from a phone.  You can actually see this phenomenon displayed from any cell phone currenty.  Call another cell on your same network, you get pretty good quality comparatively.  Call another cell on another network and depending on peering you could degrade quite a bit.  Call a line connected to any copper telco and you&#x27;re back at the lowest common denominator.  Someday if we can get people off telephone numbers (a haughty goal, unfortunately) we can do quality limited only by your hardware on each end.<p>Let me know if you have more.",1437762931

Someone walking down the street pulling handles to check for unlocked cars can only get at so many cars.<p>2. Physical distance of the attacker from the victim and their property. Specifically, they can be in a different legal jurisdiction, making it very hard to prosecute them, and therefore reducing the deterrent effect of law enforcement.<p>3. Abstract nature of the act from the criminal&#x27;s perspective. The decision to commit a crime, and the processes that deter it, are not entirely rational, and have to do with things like social anxiety, perceived safety of the environment, etc. Just like trolls say things online that they would never say I&#x27;m person, some online attackers do things they would never have the nerve to do on person, even with the same level of actual risk.<p>As to motives, these are fairly well-studied, and some are very applicable to this class of vulnerabilities.<p>1.

Very doable with these attacks.<p>3. Ideological motives. This tends to lead people to want to hurt others in particularly visible ways, so I can see the psychological appeal of using this kind of vulnerability for a terrorist attack.

Is a modern, object-oriented Basic really friendlier than (a subset of) Python or Lua (edit: with a similar standard library)? I find it at least as likely that today Basic&#x27;s reputation as an informal, hobbyist- and beginner-friendly language shapes the communities that use it in a certain way more than the language itself. I acknowledge this may not have been the case in the 1985 or even 1995. Blitz3D [1] was an exceptionally quick and easy way to do 3D in the year 2001 but at that point it could have been written to expose the same API, say,  to a Pascal compiler.<p>What exactly is right about Basic has been a matter of great interest to me lately because I have been thinking about developing a bootable early home computer Basic-like interactive environment for UEFI. I quickly realized that one of the hardest design decision involved in this project would be whether the language of the environment should actually be a dialect Basic (rather than Logo, Lua, Scheme, JavaScript, Tcl, Python or something else entirely).<p>On a related note, I wish there were large empirical studies of how quickly new programmers learn to use each of the stereotypically friendly languages. Perhaps MOOC will eventually produce those.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz3D"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz3D</a>",1437762640

9944107,comment,9936810,9940312,0,0,onethumb,,,"One of the great dilemmas with online video is the bitrate at which you compress.  The more you compress, the better then deliverability (faster starts + fewer skips, stutters, pauses, etc).  But, of course, you suffer quality loss. If you compress less, at a certain point, almost no one can view your videos because the bandwidth requirements are too high.<p>Every video service ends up deciding what&#x27;s more important to them.  To us, our decision point has been that we should deliver higher quality 1080p video than anywhere else on the Internet, and I believe we deliver that today.  Our quality at that resolution exceeds YouTube, Vimeo, and Netflix.  As a result, though, fewer people can stream it at 1080p.  There are two parts to our bet:  1) Bandwidth continues to increase, so in the future more people <i>will</i> be able to view it at this quality, and 2) our brand promise is that your photos & videos look better here than anywhere else.<p>But we can&#x27;t just leave it at that, because people do want to watch these videos.  So what we do is compromise on the compression at lower resolutions so they stream quickly and with few errors.  At 720p and lower, we&#x27;re comparable to the other services in terms of quality, bitrate, and deliverability.  In the end, it means we can deliver a very good experience to people with ample bandwidth, and a fairly good experience to people without.<p>If you have some examples, I&#x27;d be happy to take a look and make sure we&#x27;re meeting our goals on both those fronts.",1437762203

On the other hand there were a lot of errors in his books and sometimes he is hard to follow, I guess the books contents are too easy for him and he wrote the book without ever reading back.

(2) all cars implement the same AI.<p>What is far more likely is a future in which there are many different types of self-driving AIs on the road from many different manafacturers, each of which will have different algorithms for all aspects of autonomous driving. Ultimately, this diversity will lead to carmakers designing algorithms that speculate on what another car might do. This is likely because the coordination costs between n different automaker&#x27;s autonomous systems will rise with the square of n. In other words, unless we end up with a monoculture or only two or three different systems on the road, coordination just isn&#x27;t going to happen. The second issue is that even if the automakers could coordinate, such coordination would rely on vehicle to vehicle communication of the actions each car wants to take. Coding the decision making for other cars into each car to anticipate onboard makes no sense because your vehicle would not have access to the sensor data to resolve the decision of the other car. Lastly, with V2V communications, negotiation and decision making, the impact of latency in likely to be so costly to making the best decision that any attempts of doing V2V negotiation will either be non-trivial or limited to an extremely simple model such as each car proposing n strategies (where n is like 2-3 solutions) and each care deciding the best option and incompatible option. This could keep negotiation fast enough to make a best decision.<p>Regardless of whether there is negotiation or merely guessing in real time about what the other car might do, the only thing each autonomous system designer can consider is the well-being of their passengers. All vehicles involved in an imminent accident acting in the self interest of their passengers is likely to be the optimal solutions. The only improvement I can see is some negotiation where some ideas of what decisions the other car might make allows each vehicle to make slightly between decisions to preserve the well being of their passengers.<p>People just like bringing this up because it lets them discuss this interesting philosophical question about morality. Once these discussions encounter the realities of how autonomous cars are likely to evolve and penetrate the market, it&#x27;s going to be painfully obvious that this is a futile thought exercise to even waste your time with.",1437761773

9943999,comment,9943069,9943069,0,0,kstenerud,,,"There&#x27;s a trick to drinking properly.<p>Unfortunately, the USA has a culture of binge drinking, which is the absolute WRONG way to drink. I actually think it&#x27;s better to be introduced to alcohol as a child (as I was), in normal social situations rather than &quot;let&#x27;s get wasted!&quot; throw-off-all-restraint parties (which are pretty stupid in general).<p>Anyway, the trick is multipart:<p>1. Eat before you drink. Drinking on an empty stomach causes the alcohol to enter your bloodstream MUCH quicker, which makes it harder to gauge your level of inebriation as you drink (it throws off the lag time).<p>2. Ride the wave. This takes a few tries to get right, but your level of mental alertness has a bit of a cliff at a certain blood-alcohol level (the fuzzy feeling). The trick is to learn to recognize when this effect is coming on and then back off on drinking until your alertness level returns, keeping in mind that there&#x27;s a lag time from when you drink to when it actually enters the blood. This is also a good reason to be careful about what kinds of drinks you are drinking, and how fast. Nothing sucks more than slamming something back and then a few minutes later realizing that you can&#x27;t even stand up. With practice, you can remain perched on the crest of this wave and be the happy drunk all night.<p>3. Drink lots of water. Drinking it interspersed with your alcohol consumption is best, but be absolutely SURE to consume a LARGE amount of water before going to bed, depending on how much you&#x27;ve drunk that night. If I&#x27;ve consumed more than 3 stiff drinks, I try to consume 1.5L to 2L of water before going to bed. Even better is coconut water since it replenishes lost electrolytes. I&#x27;ve only ever had one hangover in my life (the one time I DIDN&#x27;T do this), and it was enough to fix my discipline in this area. Yes, you wake up a lot to go to the bathroom, but that&#x27;s better than feeling like shit the next day.",1437761499

851895,comment,851710,851824,0,0,jwhite,,,"> The article is mixed<p>I tend to agree.  The title put me off as well.  The attitude that existence depends on the event being recorded is too relativist for my personal preference.<p>The central point, that civilizations tend to underrate their ancient predecessors because the historical record becomes degraded or misinterpreted is easy to agree with.  However, the claim that our distant descendants won't have a clue what we really achieved is one-eyed.  Five hundred years ago, Europeans had lost much knowledge of the history of European civilizations, and their knowledge of civilizations on other continents varied from total ignorance upwards.  Five hundred years of progress in historical research and research methods, together with scientific progress in archaeology, geology, paleontology, climate science, medical science, etc., has allowed us to uncover much that we didn't know about the past, despite the fact that there is still much more that is lost forever.  If our civilization suffers a catastrophic event, a future civilization may still be capable of uncovering many facts about us.<p>Given the amount of knowledge that archaeologists can deduce from fragments of pottery, fragments of human remains, fragments of ancient settlements, etc., and given that the products of nuclear technology can have very long half-lives, I think the author of the article draws a long bow in claiming that thousands of years hence there will be scant evidence that we had A-bombs in the 1940's.",1254284516

I am not familiar with floormats in Toyotas and what they might look like in comparison to the accelerator pedal, but I was taught in driver's ed and at the racetrack where I run my car that should you ever run into a situation where your pedal gets stuck there are a few things you should do (which I know might not be apparent during a panic situation):<p>1) put your foot under the gas pedal and try to lift it up. never attempt to crawl down there to figure it out<p>2) turn off the ignition. you can safely brake and steer to safety without power. just takes a bit of force as you don't have power brakes/steering..<p>3) worst case scenario put it in neutral. engine will rev to hell without load and potentially get damaged but at least you can control the car safely and get to safety/pull over.",1254284421

I was immensely bored in school before I did, and I wasn't a good student beforehand. I got out of school several years early, and had more time to pursue things I was interested in. Now, I have a few more free years than I would have had otherwise, and because I worked through school, a financial cushion to take time off, travel, and potentially start a business.<p>For those interested in skipping high school, it's very easy, and anyone can do it. You should enroll at the local community college and ask the universities that you are interested in what you should take. Your professors will also be helpful in guiding your curriculum and helping you transfer. One thing to consider, though, is that some private schools like MIT, Stanford, and so on rarely accept transfer students. If you're interested in certain private schools, you should ask their admissions councilors for admissions statistics for transfers vs. freshman admits (and also general admissions advice).

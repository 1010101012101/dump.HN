40585,story,,,3,15,cellis,"How would you approach this problem?",,"One of my extremely ambitious friends that is rather naive about software dev (but nonetheless wants to make tech money), asked me a question that tortures me to this day: can you build me [an application] that predicts what someones face will look like at 20...60,etc? And maybe its because I haven't had any AI classes yet, or just because I am not looking at this the right way...but it was very interesting to me. Wondering if anyone had an opinion?",1186595722

40583,comment,40222,40222,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"During WFP07 it looked something like this on the backend:<p>45% Ruby (mostly RoR, but one might not have been using Rails)
30% PHP
15% Java
10% Perl<p>Almost all of the groups were heavily using JavaScript, as well.  In fact, some of them were predominantly JavaScript with quite lightweight back-ends (Zenter and Weebly come to mind).  Heysan were predominantly Flash at the time, but I believe they have a lot more PHP back-end code now.<p>I don't believe there were any Python projects.",1186595583

40578,comment,40222,40328,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"PHP is just a rather nasty language.  It's got a lot going for it, in terms of deploy-ability, scalability, existing libraries and code, and number of developers and designers who are familiar with it, but it's also got a horribly inconsistent standard library, poorly implemented seemingly Java-inspired objects, and a vast majority of the existing code is poorly written.<p>There are some impressive PHP projects out there, with pretty clean code (I've been pleased by the quality of code in Dokuwiki and Flyspray, for example), and you can't beat PHP with a stick for availability--you can deploy a PHP app on the cheapest Dreamhost account and expect it to work just fine.  That cannot be said of RoR, Django, or Catalyst applications (and don't even think about Lisp or Haskell or Erlang in that context).",1186595213

40573,comment,40524,40524,0,0,KB,,,"I've found that most IT managers consistently push certifications such as PMP and lead employees toward the path of management, because that is the same choice they made for themselves in the past.<p>I actually started working on a Masters in Program Management with a goal of also becoming a PMP to compliment the degree.  After 7 courses (about half way through), I came to the realization that this path was leading me right into IT management... Something I quickly realized I wanted no part of.<p>I then shortly after jumped from IT to Software Engineering at my company and have become much more satisfied with my work responsibilities.  Not to mention the ability to follow a technical career path, which doesn't exist in IT at my company. To date this has been the best decision I've made when it comes to my career.  For me... technical is the way to go.",1186594720

I promise to write about my experience.<p>If YC had an impact in our 'going for it' it was probably the encouragement Paul gave us in the phone call telling us we weren't accepted.  pg was absolutely classy, and we really realized that YC was cheering for us even though we didn't get funding.",1186594563

40570,comment,40535,40535,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"These articles are poorly written, and the content is not only wrong, it is self contradictory. Paul Graham was right in suggesting that these articles are trolls. Sadly, I think it is a case where the author of the troll is sincere. <p>The author describes three traits of businesses that will fail during a downturn: based on ad-based revenues, being fun or recreational, and being innovative. Earlier in the article he says: ""Back when the sector was hit hard in 2000, there were companies that managed to survive and grow.""  <p>It is interesting to note that one of those companies that managed to survive and grow during the last downturn was ad-based, innovative, and also could be considered ""fun"" and ""recreational."" Google, anyone?",1186594131

Projects like these tend to be a lot more engaging, at least for me, because it's something you chose to do versus company needs.<p>Hackers like to build things, so I understand your concern for taking on the position.  But it sounds like you still would have opportunity to write code, just that most of your time is spent elsewhere.",1186592660

600704,comment,600517,600568,0,0,oldgregg,,,"As someone who has spent countless hours looking for a good wireless point of sale system this is going to be huge.<p>Small retailers will snap this up and avoid the evil merchant companies. All of the inventory management and reporting lives in the cloud. Right now, besides opentable, all of the POS stuff is either really expensive or garbage.<p>The only comparable thing right now is a Symbol MC70 with Windows Mobile and an external swiper. Apple retail uses them and they are $3k+ a pop. You can get some knock of Pidion 1300s for $1200. All the software is ""enterprise"" garbage.<p>This device will be given away at cost. Pair it with an ipod touch and small business climb on board in mass. A whole new slew of small business, babysitters, and freelancers will accept credit cards.<p>They cleanup in merchant fees at the very least, and quite possibly create the holy grail of mobile-to-mobile payments -- all nicely integrated into twitter.",1241841553

There is a very great response to the whole look at the picture nonsense in the book Education's Smoking Gun by Reginald Damerell.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Educations-Smoking-Gun-Destroyed-Education/dp/0881910252"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Educations-Smoking-Gun-Destroyed-Educa...</a><p>There is an illustration of a cat, not so different from this image,<p><a href=""http://spoilurpets.com/images/Thermal%20Cat%20Mat.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spoilurpets.com/images/Thermal%20Cat%20Mat.JPG</a><p>and the illustration is labeled in Chinese. I burst out laughing as soon as I saw the illustration, because I can read Chinese, so I knew the punchline. The children are shown the illustration, and asked to guess the meaning of the Chinese characters in the caption. In the illustration that Reginald Damerell commissioned his graduate student from Taiwan to produce, the Chinese characters did not say ""the cat is on the mat,"" but rather ""the cat's eyes are open.""<p>One thing that I really like about the book Let's Read: A Linguistic Approach, by an eminent linguist and an equally eminent lexicographer, is that the stories have no illustrations whatsoever. Indeed, the final story in the book, called ""The Picture Country,"" is beautifully evocative and remarkably visual story told entirely in words, which makes the point to children that once they know how to read, they can see more beautiful pictures in their mind than one could find in all the book illustrations in the world. That is genuine reading.",1241841499

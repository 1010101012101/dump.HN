7125996,comment,7124753,7125881,1,0,thatthatis,,,"My biggest issue with gpl/copy left is that it is a _kind_ of freedom obtained by forgoing other freedoms.  It isn&#x27;t a more _free_ platform, it is a more _open_ platform.<p>If I work on a gpl product I give up important characteristics of ownership in that work.  I lose certain freedoms to gain others.<p>I define freedom as the ability to do as I wish.  The gpl restricts that, and thus can&#x27;t be said to be totally free.<p>The gpl is an interesting and in many ways compelling philosophy, but it ties you to its philosophy - it doesn&#x27;t allow you the freedom to follow your own.<p>---<p>You mention long term value.  I think that, like the medicine patent system, copy middle gives us higher long term ecosystem value at the expense of short term value.  I should put my assumptions into an economic simulation some time and really model out the question of in which circumstance copy middle vs copy left gives higher long term value.",1390759176

7125992,comment,7125845,7125845,2,0,hirundo,,,"Never forget, the Jews say of the Shoah. It becomes harder to keep that promise if it&#x27;s seen as uncivil merely to draw comparisons to that era. And it&#x27;s important that the promise be kept. One can accuse someone of an intolerance akin to Nazi supporters without accusing someone of wanting to re-enact the Shoah. And it&#x27;s certainly reasonable to analogize contemporary attempts to level the 1% with the corollary attempts in Germany in the 1930s. That analogy is not the same as to depict Occupy sympathizers as Nazis. When it is taken that way it&#x27;s likely simply an attempt to divert serious contemplation of the actual similarity between the motivations driving those two movements.",1390759103

From my experience, an owner does have more rights to the property and its use, purely because they are the owner.

7125986,comment,7125239,7125239,2,0,ninh,,,"Multiple income streams is the best starting point imo if you don&#x27;t know what you want to double down on. Getting $100k itself is not an easy task, let alone trying to get $100k off of a single thing. It&#x27;s easier (and more pragmatic) to get to $100k by getting $5k on product A in YRR, $20k on product B etc... These things will eventually add up and need to be easily maintainable projects (as opposed to timesink projects). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend writing a super complex app consisting of millions of lines of code for example that requires a lot of support towards your customers; instead, consider writing an e-book and selling it for $10-30 a pop. Or a SaaS that nets you $10 MRR per customer.<p>Another upside imo of this approach is that you can discern at a later stage which one of your projects is most successful and has the most chance of getting you to $100k YRR, on its own. This will allow you to decide if you want to double down on it or not.<p>Also, consider building things someone wants: I know, I know, easier said than done, but it&#x27;s often a good place to start at what you&#x27;d like yourself. In a worst case scenario, you&#x27;ll at least have 1 customer (yourself) ;-)",1390759014

A bit of a rant (not directed at the person who wrote this, because the link at hand is great):<p>Writing APIs in Go is not the hard part. There are a ton of options for routing basic URLs to handlers. There are a few areas that are a nightmare, total total nightmare:<p>* SQL - The raw database/sql package in Go is very low-level. It is a terrible experience to use in a project that makes anything more than a handful of simple queries. I&#x27;m not asking for an ORM, but it would really benefit the community if there was a SQLAlchemy style (the non-ORM part of it) library for Go. It should be MUCH easier to make basic queries to SQL and get out results.<p>* Templating - The built in &quot;html/template&quot; package is just not good enough for a web app when compared to something like Jinja (Python). &quot;html/template&quot; gets points for being simple, and actually its not a complaint against &quot;html/template&quot;: I think there just needs to be a more feature-packed templating package like Jinja for Go. &quot;html/template&quot; doesn&#x27;t support things like inheritance, didn&#x27;t even support comparison operators until Go 1.2, etc.<p>These two problems have made it so I&#x27;ve pretty much given up web apps in Go for now. Services in Go are _amazing_. But if you&#x27;re trying to get a full blown web app (again, not the point of the linked article above), then you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time.",1390758974

How can one say that time flows slower in higher absolute gravitational potential then somewhere else without being able to unambiguously say what&#x27;s before and what&#x27;s after at those two points.<p>Cauchy surface at least from wiki description doesn&#x27;t sound much like a simultaneity line/surface/subspace. Is it dependent on the speed of the observer? I&#x27;m looking for some concept that in universe without mass reduces to SRT simultaneity. It might be twisted, branching, looping as in you lensing example but smoothly transitioning towards SRT simultaneity as mass goes to zero.

They believe that this control will help effect social justice. As a result of this world view, these people have reacted to the influence of Google and other technology companies by protesting it and its employees. Central to the protests is the fact that said employees are willing and able to pay more for apartments (and other services) than the protestors would like, thus inhibiting the ability of the protestors (or people the protestors sympathize with) to obtain apartments or services for a low price. Moreover, these protestors substantially comprise the set of individuals who have engaged in such protests.&quot;<p>I am aware of people who are opposed to Google for other reasons - e.g. privacy advocates. I am not aware of substantial numbers of them engaging in anti-Google-bus protests in San Francisco; their protests have different characteristics.<p>And yes, I called them both &quot;leftist&quot; and &quot;commie&quot;. I contend that this summary is accurate, and that many of these protestors would gladly admit to embracing leftism and either support or express sympathy for communism.

Consulting jobs pay well, you&#x27;re usually your own boss, you can deduct a lot of expenses and you can basically charge what you want regardless of your experience. Experience will come.<p>Shoot for large corporations with a new contract. They&#x27;ll have a big budget handled by some managers who don&#x27;t know how to handle such a sum of money. They&#x27;ll hire consultants to do work that&#x27;s been done within the company many times. It&#x27;s just easier to hire a person than to spend time trying to find something or someone within the enterprise. The trick is not to charge too low but to charge as high as experienced consultants. You just need to look really professional and speak well during the interview (Duh!).<p>After a while, consultants repeat the same things over and over with different clients. They look like they work but they&#x27;re actually laughing! I work at a major telecom company in Canada and what I&#x27;ve described above is not only common, it&#x27;s the norm. I&#x27;ve seen processes on Word documents that took months to complete and when you look at the document&#x27;s properties, you see it was addressed to another person/company! It was just an existing document repurposed for a new client with minor changes.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you should be bad like that, I&#x27;m saying that once you get your first contract, it&#x27;s then easy to find other work that&#x27;s not too hard and pays well. You can work full time for one client or part time for several and contracts usually go from 3 months to one year at a time.<p>Like others are saying below, you&#x27;ve got to solve problem. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ve got to find a solution to problems that have no solution yet. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve been trying to do so far. You don&#x27;t need to invent new things to be an innovator, you can be an innovator every day by solving someone&#x27;s problem, one step at the time. Taking my example above, if a company hires a consultant, it&#x27;s because they have a problem to solve. Once you&#x27;re there, you can help them solve their problem and innovate on what they&#x27;re already doing.<p>No, I&#x27;m not a consultant but I&#x27;m thinking of becoming one.

I will not even attempt to say it is not a valid opinion: a lot of people I know hold this opinion, and at least in the short term it seems to be a consistent opinion. I think there is an interesting discussion to be had &quot;in the long term&quot;, but it is just that: a discussion. However, I am going to assert that it is, in fact, an opinion. The thing you need to understand is that the other side of this particular opinion does not actually care about <i>either</i> &quot;#_advances_open_sourced&quot; <i>or</i> &quot;%_advances_open_sourced&quot;: the goal is freedom, not openness, and these are assets that are neither equivalent nor convertible.<p>To put this into a very simple example: if Apple open sourced every single software component on the iPhone, that would be extremely &quot;open&quot;. We would know everything about how the iPhone worked, and we&#x27;d have learned a lot as a community about how to build mobile phone operating systems. This would help other people and companies work on mobile phones, and might have positive effects on things entirely unrelated to mobile phones. To the people who care about variables related to &quot;#_advances_open_sourced&quot;, this would be a great outcome, and &quot;%_advances_open_sourced&quot; is even 100%: seems great.<p>But, in such a universe, I will argue that the users of an iPhone are still not &quot;free&quot; because they are unable to take the software running on their iPhone and replace it with modified software based on all of that wonderful open source code. In fact, lest you say &quot;people then shouldn&#x27;t buy an iPhone&quot;, it might be the case that users of <i>any device</i> are not free, because there is absolutely no guarantee in such a universe that any of the numerous devices that are based on this open source software--even if 100% of the software on these devices is itself open source--actually allow users to modify the software running on them (hence, GPL3).<p>This is the difference between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open&quot;, and in my understanding this is why Stallman makes the points he makes: he doesn&#x27;t care whether there are more cool and fun toys built out of open components, what he cares about is whether the toys we have restrict our freedom. It might be that a world where we are more free has fewer toys. In my interpretation, Stallman would consider that a &quot;win&quot; for mankind. In his mind, that argument &quot;so don&#x27;t buy an iPhone&quot; seems to be related to the argument &quot;so don&#x27;t link against their code&quot;, and he wants people to stop: the idea is that if you don&#x27;t like people restricting freedom, you should actively avoid yourself supporting it.<p>(So, that&#x27;s all I really have to say in response. However, if you--or anyone else--finds this kind of stuff interesting, I spent a lot of time a few months ago writing a lot about this subject, and in particular this tradeoff, in a comment thread on Hacker News when FreeBSD deprecated gcc. Of particular highlight, I go into detail on the property that GPL is more a license about binaries and hackability as it applies to end users than about source code and extensibility as it applies to developers, as well as why this causes debates about this subject among a bunch of developers to be problematic, due to the different incentives developers have from end users.)<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6209724"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6209724</a>",1390757557

7125872,comment,7125464,7125780,11,0,chimeracoder,,,"I&#x27;m going to chime in, since I&#x27;ve been using Go as my primary language for over a year, and I&#x27;m currently working on a major (production) Go project that others might see as well-suited for Rails (in fact, the early prototype was written in Rails[0])<p>> The thing no framework I have seen so far addresses is persistence. SQL persistence in Golang is a bit of a nightmare. It&#x27;s raw SQL, and the database libraries are fussy.<p>> The thing that makes Rails so easy to write in, especially for newcomers, is ActiveRecord. As far as I can tell, nothing like it exists (in a stable form) for Golang.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend newcomers to Go use SQL right off the bat. Document-based storage (like CouchDB or MongoDB), or even key/value (Redis, etc.) is much more aligned with Go&#x27;s concept of structs, and all three of those databases have strong library support in Go. If you&#x27;re just looking to dabble in Go and just happen to need a database (and it doesn&#x27;t matter which), I&#x27;d recommend playing around with those first. Even Neo4j works very well with Go, though as of January 2013 (when I last used it), the only Go library for Neo4j was third-party, and not very well-documented.<p>That said, once you know the Go language, using SQL (either with or without an ORM) is straightforward, if not as convenient as ActiveRecord. jmoiron has a good blog post[1] comparing the good, bad, and ugly of Go ORMs, so I won&#x27;t try to top that here - rather, I&#x27;ll share my experience.<p>(As pointed out elsewhere, ORMs are not universally liked as a general concept, so I&#x27;m writing this comparison assuming that one actually <i>does</i> want the features an ORM provides - naturally, if you prefer prepared SQL, Go already provides perfect support for that.)<p>Gorp is definitely not as &quot;magical&quot; as ActiveRecord, but it certainly does the job. A number of the ways in which it differs from ActiveRecord have more to do with the (strongly) static vs. dynamic difference in type systems, though some are specific to Go&#x27;s architecture.<p>There are a few odd features here and there that are still missing (for example, I&#x27;m actually not sure if there&#x27;s a wrapper function for &quot;INSERT IF NOT EXISTS&quot; yet, though it&#x27;s not a huge bother).<p>I do end up spending more time thinking about the queries that I&#x27;m using, compared to Django or Rails. There is some additional verbosity - I have to write some helper functions that I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have to. On the other hand, I know exactly what queries are being executed at all times, so it&#x27;s easy to identify potential bottlenecks.<p>In short - I agree that ActiveRecord is more convenient than anything that currently exists in Go. On the other hand, it&#x27;s reasonably advanced <i>enough</i> that relative newcomers to the language[2] shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with it. So far, the biggest bottleneck in development of this application has not been with the SQL bindings, even though it would be nice to spend a bit less time on that front.<p>It hasn&#x27;t had as much time to develop and mature as ActiveRecord have, but those of us using it in production have accepted those tradeoffs.<p>[0] If you&#x27;re wondering why we didn&#x27;t continue it in Rails, we had to scrap the original codebase for a number of other reasons, so given that we weren&#x27;t keeping any of the original code, there was no logical reason we needed to use the same language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jmoiron.net/blog/golang-orms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmoiron.net/blog/golang-orms/</a><p>[2] As opposed to newcomers to programming in general",1390757471

Then,  if/when a company tries this and fails to find a market, the advances sometimes/often get repatriated as part of the shutdown.<p>Copy left tries to use anti-ownership ideals to ensure software remains free.

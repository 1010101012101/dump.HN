Then you continue to pay the salary to the remaining founder & any replacing employee & split the dividends. I guess the remaining founder would receive gradual increase to his equity share as part of his package.<p>BTW, wouldn't most vesting schedules have already left this founder with quote a bit of equity (2.5 years)?",1225327939

I'm picky about writing because I'm a bad writer.<p>In any case, I feel you.<p>However, I think ""individualism web"" will deflate if it's not deflating already.

For example, if you cared to you could get everything for reading offline at your leisure.<p>And while it seems cumbersome for words, it is more convenient than a blog for code that I post.

But I'm hoping that it will be a win for things that are code-y rather than wordy.<p>> On the other hand, the blog doesn't have support for comments, so I thought about forking the repo, adding my own comment to the text, then sending back a pull request.

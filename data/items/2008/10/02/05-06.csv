321464,comment,320989,321421,0,0,pius,,,"<i>there isn't one.</i><p>That's about as true for mashups as it is for the semantic web; in both cases, there is not an ""official"" trust model used across the web, though it's obviously possible for semantic web providers to do what every other API provider does and simply use their reputation.  For example, what makes you trust the data you get from any API at all, if not for the provider's reputation?  I do agree that there should be a more uniform approach in order to get wide usage of the technology beyond the enterprise, academia, and medicine.<p>This apparent lack of an official trust model won't be the case for long with POWDER [1] on the horizon.  POWDER is on its way to becoming a ratified W3C standard and it makes steps to address the idea of a ""web of trust.""  Who knows what kind of traction this will get in the near term, but I think it's a step in the right direction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-powder-primer-20080815"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-powder-primer-20080815</a>",1222927042

321461,comment,321307,321307,0,0,jamongkad,,,"Speed benchmarks aside. I feel his points are valid granted you're coming from a Java/C++ background (where most CS graduates come from anyways). But frankly MooTools feels like it's applying classical OOP to javascript. Whereareas jQuery feels more functional and natural. There is no right and wrong approach (although given the choice I would have js be a statically typed language) it's just that both libs are the love child of their respective creators to work in something they enjoy doing. And have healthy communities to support their endeavors!<p>Now I'm starting to see one of the posters gripe about jQuery plugins. And for me I think that is by design. jQuery I believe was designed to be a lightweight as possible. Practicing modularity at it's finest. Had jQuery been baked with all the bells and whistles, I do not think it would have attracted a large number of devs. Thinking about it what would SQlite be had it had all the bells and whistles of MySQL?!?!<p>Now I do not know which JS lib fares better when working with a team. I suspect MooTools (due to it's classical OOP behavior) might win out.",1222926914

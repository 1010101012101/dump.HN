""Real"" apps on the web have a chicken/egg problem: no one builds them because they assume everyone can install natively.  Why is there no ""web Skype""?  Because Skype assumes that being cross-platform with QT is enough.<p>What Google is saying is ""We envision a future where most of people's daily computer usage can be done entirely online.""  Not professional image editing, or publishing, or recording an album.  But chatting, checking email/wave, taking notes, whipping up a spreadsheet to analyze data, posting to websites for help, reading the news and researching can be done that way.<p>But WHY?  Why would <i>anyone</i> go for Chrome OS instead of a regular old laptop?  Because, like me, they're tired of it.  They'd be happy to have desktop at home and a laptop at work and a cell phone in their pocket.  But how the heck do you get the contact on your cell phone into your work and home computers?  Do you install sync software everywhere and sync all the time?  You have an idea in the car, but it belongs in the notebook on your desktop at home...how do you manage that, easily, seamlessly?  Or, as Google points out, you lose the device.  The photo you took with your phone or your webcam is now lost.  My GPS doesn't store where I drove and sync with my camera in my phone to associate photos with places, and merging those two and getting them online to send to my family is a huge pain. Because these devices all operate in a mode that is fundamentally local and only incidentally networked.  Data syncing is a pain, and it prevents us from buying lots of different devices that are meant for use in all kinds of situations.  Sure, the cloud is available on these devices, but it's not the /standard/.  Gadgets don't scale, and it's not because of technology, it's because of a barrier in how people think about gadgets.<p>I didn't get this until I got an Android phone.  Suddenly, the whole problem of how I manage email syncing and contact management on my phone wasn't easier...it simply disappeared entirely.  I just don't think about it anymore.  If I add a contact in my phone, I know it'll be there when I go to dial it from Google Voice at work.  It's just not a problem I think about anymore.  Well, what if /most/ of my data were like that?  We can come close with products like DropBox, which I use and love, but that's not everything...it's about 2GB of my stuff.  Chrome OS is about the idea that you can have an extra computer that covers many of your daily usages and tasks, but without any of the overhead of owning a new computer.  No antivirus to install (the root partition is read-only), no local or remote backups to make, no data syncing.  That is how I see the vision for Chrome OS, and it is not a vision that is going to materialize because source code was released today, or because they sell a netbook with a new OS on it next year.  It is a vision that will be realized because people will be tired of having to sync yet another of their dozens of devices (Desktop, laptop, netbook, cell phone, GPS, Camera...) and will realize that life just got quite a bit less complicated when they used a lightweight, cheap netbook with Chrome OS on it.<p>At least, that's what I think the vision is.  I could be completely wrong.",1258700036

There are well-known ways to significantly cut the cost of your college education: going to in-state schools, and conducting the first two years of your education at a community college.  Despite this many people shun in-state institutions (unless they're in a state like California which has numerous highly regarded public universities, but then again they're all hard to get into), and even more laugh the the notion of Jr. College, determining it only fit for misfits teens and continuing adult education Note: I don't agree with that assessment, but it serves to illustrate the fact that college has become so closely tied to social status, making pricey schools all the more desirable.<p>As for what's driving tuition upwards, it's probably the fact that the modern University has become a luxury resort.  They've got an array of clinics, career councilors, psychologists, paid tutors, entire buildings designated for non-athletic student recreation, bike and jogging paths, numerous social groups, reasonably well-maintained facilities and immaculately manicured campuses.<p>Further driving costs upward, besides state budget shortfalls for public universities, is the fact that they are very aggressive at handing out scholarships to attract top-notch students, along with the significant amount of marketing that is conducted to get everyone else to shell out big-bucks for their undergraduate programs.<p>And when you look at study after study that shows you're going to earn significantly more over your lifetime if you get a college education, is it any surprise people are willing to eat the high upfront costs?  Paying $50,000 to a student loan for an additional $10K+/year in earnings potential seems like a bargain to me.  Granted, it's not always going to work out for the best, but hey you gotta take risks to get ahead.",1258699849

Don't get me wrong - the web has changed the game, but whatever the de facto HTML standards are is somewhat of a sideshow.<p>I often feel as though we're cramming certain applications through the filter of HTML while we wait for native apps to catch up. Google Docs is the canonical example for me.<p>Here's what I like about Google Docs, other than being free:<p><pre><code>   - Docs are stored in the cloud, not tied to one machine
   - Collaboration
   - Rapid introduction of new features

I hear this a lot.<p>I'm an Occam's Razor kind of guy. There's myriad reasons to explain this, all of which are less cloak-and-dagger. Here's a few:<p>- IE has a huge userbase, which is slow to upgrade, and IE is deeply integrated with Windows. This means tons of inertia. Big companies move slowly.<p>- They won't make any more money by implementing HTML5, XHTML, CSS3, or whatever the currently en vogue standard is, and it would cost a <i>ton</i> of money.<p>- Their customers don't give a shit (extension of the previous point).

Thus we have convoluted methods of teaching addition like this that in some way do make sense, but are mostly just another layer of confusion.<p>The proper way, I believe, is to just have the student learn the concept by rote.

Google isn't interested in developing a full blown desktop OS themselves. If the community wants to add stuff maybe at some point in the future Google will fold some of it back into their official Chrome OS releases. Ultimately it's a product they're giving away for free so they clearly don't intend to make money directly off Chrome OS (or Android) so if you choose to get a Chrome OS variant from another source it doesn't really matter.",1258697624

If you read the questions answered during the demo (check Matt Cutts blog) you will see that they repeatedly emphasized on the fact that chrome OS is built for netbook computer and with users in mind who primarily depends on web applications. That is all they are going to do for 2010 and they made no secret of that.<p>So if you like PC/Mac games. Chrome OS is not for you.
If you use photoshop heavily. Chrome OS is not for you.
If you use skype heavily. Chrome OS is not for you.<p>As a matter of fact if you depend on any applications that needs to be installed on the HD, Chrome OS probably not for you. The key word with Chrome OS is ""Web Application"". They are very clear about it and they are not trying to hide their intentions.<p>I like Google's approach in this. I think they are testing the water with netbook market (which is already quite strong at the moment) and after they set themselves up they will jump in to other market.<p>A good OS (even if it has a Linux kernel and other matured open source projects) takes a long time to be awesome from really good. Google knows that and I think most HN readers realizes that too.<p>I think google can already smell the future and they know that vast majority of users (if not all) will mostly rely on web applications for their day to day work and its already very true for some of us.",1258697546

This kind of tension is necessary to the process.<p>When developers can make whatever they feel like making, we get linux.<p>When Steve Jobs is there to lobby for the customer, to lobby for beauty and ease of use and a focus on the details and thorough documentation, then we get OS X and the other ""It Just Works"" features that Apple is becoming known for.<p>Customers want a Steve Jobs parental figure to stand there beating back the hordes of opportunistic Bonzi Buddy coders trying to make a quick million. That's why people pay premiums for Apple products.<p>Love it or hate it, the philosophy behind the App Store is a large part of Apple's growing success. The philosophy is that the user will pay more and in return the developer has to jump through some hoops and get his app approved.<p>Having said that, obviously the approval process needs to be adjusted. It sounds relatively trivial, in fact, for Apple to implement a procedure that would allow minor bug fixes while still putting apps through an approval process.<p>It would be great if customers could trust developers, but the truth is they can't.

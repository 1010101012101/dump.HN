A company may be hold such beneficial position for a while, but not forever if we allow competitions and fair market without political connection to protect this status quo by law.<p>2. Human being can invent things and no one buys them. We see this everyday in fail web startups. And customers vote with their money and their time to use service or product, so if an invention doesn't improve general/macro efficiency for its own customers with spent time/exhanges of money. It won't sell. And don't forget that people can choose not to use the service and product unless it is required by law. Apple/Microsoft are not in such position if I remember it correctly.<p>So invention as you said is improvement of efficiency. They may not improvement in their own manufacturing efficiency but they improve macro efficiency.<p>3. I understand the human right issue, that's why I raise restaurant business as a case. Why there are so many illegal immigrants working in restaurant business under bad conditions and people are aware of and without saying a word? Those workers also don't want to go to law enforcement to endanger themselves.<p>4. But to improve the human right issue in China, I don't think there is shortcut. The only way is to wait for the time that Chinese labors demand and fight for their rights. for democracy and rules of law. This takes time and unfortunately we are exploit them for business benefits.<p>5. As for fair taxation of such a huge profit. Don't you think it is very unfair for USA to take lion share of them and redistribute it to USA citizens ONLY. Or due to Apple's most work is done in china and let Chinese government to take majority of the profit on behalf of workers or ruling bureaucrats?",1327499934

3509663,comment,3506345,3507281,4,0,jng,,,"Jerf, thanks so much for sharing your thoughts. I think I agree with all your views. They are taken from the real experience of trying those approaches. And I am grateful that you provide the feedback. I and anyone tackling this steep mountain need all the help we can get.<p>I am sure that inspectability/debuggability are two of the big issues with such an approach. When things fail, the more magic there is, the more difficult it is to fix it. It's even difficult to understand what's happening!<p>I do think that there is a gap there. You can specify things and have the environment apply your spec. If it's totally naive, like Prolog's ""slowsort"", it will take exponential time and be impractical for real-world cases. But if strategies can be found and/or devised, and applied, which get some efficiency, it can be practical for many things. When things fall apart, it's clear that powerful debuggers will be needed. A lot of work will be needed on the tools, similar to SQL Query Strategy Inspectors, etc... maybe even professionals specializing just in this. But I think that it will finally allow us to write code in a sane way. Even if armies of professionals have to come after the fact to tweak it so that it's usable, the same as for SQL.<p>I totally understand what you see as adavantageous in Haskell. I think that same ""it's turtles all the way down"", where you can inspect and debug every step, is the reason that Haskell cannot gain the power that I am after. Prolog can't either, for other reasons.<p>I believe a fundamentally different approach is needed. And that's what I'm trying to sketch out.<p>And thanks to you and many other people hopefully we can learn whether there is something there or there isn't, and if there is, hopefully reach some useful result!",1327499226

3509661,comment,3505632,3505632,2,0,reduxredacted,,,"I've had been using the Costco Kirkland AAs for a long time, but I stopped last year due to a perceived shelf life issue.<p>In an attempt to reduce waste, I use a ""battery rotation"" in my house.  They start in the kids toys.  When they reach the ""flake out"" point (this is where the toy starts behaving like it's demon possessed, saying only one or two words of a song, playing it's ""music"" without anyone touching it, etc), they get tossed into a ""drained"" box where they are used in IR remote controls or LED flashlights (I have 15 LED flashlights, story in another thread).  When the LED flashlights burn through them, I put them in my IR remotes.  They last, literally, for months before the IR remotes kill them.  Then they get recycled.<p>The problem I found with the Kirkland over the Energizer and Duracell (and I'll admit my sample size was two of their 48 packs) was that as I got to about the middle of the 48 pack, the unused remaining batteries wouldn't run the toys.  They'd light the LED flashlights about as well as the batteries in the drained box.  As this happened twice, my guess was that the Kirkland batteries don't have the shelf-life of the Energizers.  I don't think it was environmental conditions--all batteries were stored in the same place and went through four seasons.  Two 48 packs of Kirkland and I'm on my third 36 pack of Energizers, though I never hooked it up to a device to get an accurate measurement, so take it for what it's worth.<p>After getting frustrated with the Kirkland's I decided to bite the bullet and go to rechargable.  I went with AA and AAA NiMh batteries.  My kids have a lot of electronic toys, and they get rotated into and out of use as they get bored with them.  I switched to all NiMh (expensive) batteries, last year (not sure if they had the ""fix"" that was mentioned about the Sanyo batteries but considering how quickly they stopped taking any charge after very few recharges, I'm guessing not).  After the kids used the first set of toys (about 16 batteries worth), I stored them for about 2 weeks as usual (turned off, not removed, I know, I know).  When I put them back in rotation, they were completely dead (I didn't measure, but I did put two in my Sony TV remote and no dice).  This made the batteries worthless.  Kids toys made in the last ten years require tools to replace the batteries and my battery charger only holds 4 batteries, so this is an all day ordeal of charging, watching, changing, charging and of course, figuring out how to get past the child-proof battery holder, putting the batteries in wrong or discovering the need to clean the terminals, unscrewing and screwing them back in.<p>I did find that if the batteries were fully charged prior to storage, they worked after rotation, but it seemed they didn't work very long.<p>I'd like to be a whole lot less wasteful (both money, time and materials).  Does anyone have any experience with a specific brand of rechargable AA and AAA battery that retains most of its current charge when stored for up to 3 weeks not fully charged (I'll even go through the trouble of removing them from the toys if I have no choice), and from a cost perspective make sense for toys that require batteries to have a discharge rate similar to good Alkaline batteries?<p>Edit: Clarify storage conditions.",1327499179

The very same way you get a text message from carrier A while being a subscriber of carrier B. Now enter international territory. You interconnect with lots of networks, each of which can (in my experience services like that were often from/cheapest in eastern Europe) hand out access to more people to send on their behalf.<p>Google can only try to protect you in limited cases. Check if the mail says it is originated from Google and notice that it isn't (flags a lot of false positives, if you are a valid sender, sending in a non-standard way). Checking headers (easily forged for most parts). Things like SPF [1] where you, as the admin of a domain, can tell the world that really only host X sends mails on your behalf.<p>The world might not care though - and the burden is again not on your very own 'carrier' (Google here), but on everyone on this planet that runs a domain.<p>There might be other ways, but inherently this problem is unsolved.

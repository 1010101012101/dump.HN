If you look at the Atom docs, however, you&#x27;ll quickly find that programming in Atom is <i>nothing</i> like programming in Haskell---it&#x27;s merely embedded there. The type system helps to ensure that your embedding does falter, but most of the errors still live in the sublanguage and I&#x27;m not sure how far Haskell&#x27;s type system goes toward reducing those.<p>[0] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom</a>",1394899087

People do &quot;cheat&quot; in the sense of &quot;acting unfairly to gain an advantage.&quot; For example using ADD prescriptions to get extra time on exams is a well-known trick, another is to have college application counsellors ghostwrite essays and then there are numerous other methods which may not technically count as cheating but achieve the desired effect.

You can probably develop what you need in any number of languages and OS.  I would go with what is you are comfortable with.  Take a look at SDL2,  you could probably put together something in one day.  The only thing unusual you mentioned is the external triggering mechanism.  Whatever this is you will need some kind of device API/interfacing code, so this may decide which OS you will need to use.  SDL2 is cross platform so you should be good to go there.",1394898523

7404869,comment,7397637,7404243,2,0,enko,,,"I think we are talking about different things here.<p>I&#x27;m well aware that 99% of companies <i>could</i> get by with any old web framework. Should they, though? Of course not. Since we&#x27;re talking about rails, let&#x27;s use that example. It&#x27;s an extremely productive, flexible, capable rapid application environment. And yes, it&#x27;s not a speed demon, especially when used naively, no-one denies that. So why do companies choose it?<p>It&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re stupid or inexperienced. It&#x27;s because the tradeoffs of higher productivity are worth the penalty in execution speed. Slightly higher server costs are worth the massive boost in productivity compared to other options. Why do you think it&#x27;s so popular? If you&#x27;re going to reply &quot;because people are cargo cult following lemmings&quot;, you are simply wrong. The tradeoffs make sense to them, that&#x27;s why.<p>So you&#x27;re a sysadmin. Linux uses python all over the place. Why is that? They could have used any old language. But they chose python, even though it&#x27;s slower than C, because the tradeoffs - easy to read, write, maintain - are worth it.<p>VFX could not be a more different environment than rapid web application development. As you say, 1% improvement means big bucks. You know what 1% improvement gets you on the web? Diddly shit. And every few percent raw speed increase on the web, as you drop down into the less dynamic frameworks, costs you massively in dev time, maintainability, hireability. It is a balance people strike. If I could increase my team&#x27;s productivity 10% at the cost of doubling our server expenses I would take that deal instantly.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the fads you mention, except I also generally disdain them. But progress does happen. Which is why the web sites for the films you help make are probably not just written in any old web framework, they&#x27;re probably written in rails or node or what have you, because the tradeoffs are worth it.<p>Remember what site you&#x27;re on. This is about startups, small companies trying to grow fast. It&#x27;s not about hyper-optimised rendering farms. Different worlds, dude!<p>Anyway, I think you actually agree with me, and I with you, if we just step into each other&#x27;s shoes for a second.<p>Although I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s so hard about making a couple of animated videos. 99% of the time you can just use any old rendering framework. I mean you just ask for a frame, it generates it, and saves it to disk right? Dude, I could do that with povray in 1995 on a 386. Whyever would you need 16 thousand computers for that? And 5PB of RAID? I can store a whole movie in like 3GB and that&#x27;s 1080P! Actually my imac can make pretty realistic graphics in games, maybe you should buy one of them?

An interesting one and a very interesting one (warning, other peoples scales may be calibrated differently to mine).<p>1) Black holes accelerate things <i>massively</i>, so they&#x27;re travelling at an astonishing speed before they &quot;enter&quot;. This can result in huge amounts of x-rays being emitted due to heating things to millions of degrees (well beyond white hot!). It&#x27;s not the black hole itself, but the black hole is certainly to blame. <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/blkbin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/blkbin.html</a><p>2) The weirder one. Hawking radiation: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation</a><p>Hawking radiation happens when a pair of virtual particles &quot;pop&quot; into existence near the event horizon. Normally these pairs annihilate quickly, but if it happens near the event horizon it&#x27;s possible for one of the particles to fall in and the other to escape. This results in a loss of mass of the black hole (told you it was weird) so could be considered to be the black hole emitting radiation.",1394896547

Developers weren&#x27;t being asked what the wanted or needed managers were influenced by sales teams to go with either IBM or BEA. Application servers were at least a 2GB download and easily required a GB of memory to run (this is still a lot in 2014, go figure what this was in 2004). Of course everything was closed source, super expensive (so your company never updated) and servers took a minimum of 5 minutes to boot up. A hello world in the then dominant EJB 2 technology required implementing 3 interfaces, inheriting from a base class, using a special compiler tool to enhance the class another compiler tool to create stubs and needed some 20 lines of XML in an incredibly verbose format to be registered.<p>You didn&#x27;t need to be a technology export to predict developers didn&#x27;t really like this tech (understatement of the year).<p>In 2005 Sun made a dramatic turn, and Java EE 5 started focussing on developer demands instead. Meanwhile many open source initiatives started or were getting mature (Sun&#x27;s GlassFish, JBoss, Apache&#x27;s Geronimo and recently TomEE).<p>Java EE 6 (2009) and EE 7 (2013) continued this trend.<p>Long story short, completely free and open source servers that start in a second or less and are between 30 and 120MB to download now dominate the market. The APIs have been dramatically simplified and the process of contributing to the platform has been largely opened, making it possible for anyone to create issues, submit patches or discuss the future direction. There&#x27;s one thorny exception and that&#x27;s the so-called TCK: a test suite that checks spec compliance is still mostly closed.<p>And yes, there are now hip startups using Java EE, for example <a href=""http://zeef.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zeef.com</a><p>All in all Java EE has become somewhat of a secret weapon.

You give Tesla the ability to sell direct to consumer, then everybody else will want to do the same. Franchise dealerships don&#x27;t get their contracts renewed and every car maker moves to direct to consumer. Congratulations State Legislator jonknee, you&#x27;ve just cost New Jersey a minimum of 1,000 very lucrative jobs.<p>To give you an idea of how important 1,000 jobs are to a state economy, when Alabama was fighting for Hyundai to come open up a plant for 2,000 workers, with an average salary of just $40,000, Alabama offered around $253 <i>million</i> in incentives or over $115,000 per job. This is because of all the economic activity having just 1,000 employees running around with cash in their pockets would create and the network effects therein. Over 5 or 10 years, Alabama is set to make up that investment in spades.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much your average car dealership owner makes, but I bet it&#x27;s quite a bit over $40,000. I bet a 1,000 out of work bankrupt dealership owners is a pretty big slice of state economic pie. Over 5 or 10 years, I&#x27;d hazard they represent way more than $253 million in activity to New Jersey.<p>So congratulations, you&#x27;ve just cost New Jersey hundreds of millions of dollars in GDP and economic activity <i>just</i> by counting only the dealership owners and not all the rest.<p>Now you and I both know that when you go to 47 in Vineland, and there&#x27;s mile after mile of car dealerships. They don&#x27;t just have 1 or 2 sales guys. Each of those places employs a dozen to two dozen sales guys. A dealership can do that because they don&#x27;t pay these guys almost anything except commission, so they can afford to keep a bunch of them around, grooming their power ties. So let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s an average of 12 sales guys for New Jersey&#x27;s 1,000 dealerships or 12,000 people employed just selling the cars.<p>Well a Tesla style dealership doesn&#x27;t want high pressure commission only power tie wearing salesmen. They want &quot;car information experts&quot;. So they hire say 4 guys to mill around and direct potential customers to the interactive information kiosks. Let&#x27;s say NJ is able to get all 4 of these guys from the pool of current car sales guys. What happens to the other 8?<p>So we have about 8,000 guys out of work. Congratulations. Let&#x27;s use Alabama&#x27;s model, you&#x27;ve just cost New Jersey a few billion dollars in economic losses. And now all those food trucks and restaurants and tie shops have to figure out how to get by with 1/3rd the number of customers. So that&#x27;s even more people out of work and more economic losses.<p>How much economic damage are you willing to cause New Jersey, legislator jonknee, just so consumers don&#x27;t have to haggle a bit when they buy a car every 7 years on average?",1394895841

In the natural course of a human life it can be observed that some &quot;cancerous&quot; cells cease to exist / be problems, not from some external intervention, but merely through other signals and interactions within the body. Maybe some process detected something was wrong and set in motion another process that corrected it.<p>What controls these processes? Likely complex electro-chemical reactions that can only occur in certain environments. If a suitable environment does not exist, the reaction does not occur (how can it?).<p>Now, consider that the human consciousness can be observed to seemingly create complex changes throughout the body, including numerous electro-chemical reactions, and even changes of local environments (e.g. release of neurotransmitters and more general hormones).<p>If the appropriate environment is created for the appropriate reactions in the appropriate places to &quot;resolve a cancer&quot;, then it will happen.<p>Yes, you can argue about how much fine control a consciousness can have over it&#x27;s body. You can also argue about what reactions happen in which environments.<p>>There&#x27;s a lot of evidence about how cancer cells work and little (if any) gives reason to suspect some sort of conscious connection would affect it.<p>Such as?

It comes down to the fact that most games are now online services, with updated content, special events, virtual economies, player interaction, etc&quot;<p>As someone who plays both online and offline AAA games on console (PS4, Xbox One) and PC, I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that online-heavy games are more likely to ship with major problems than offline games.<p>For <i>both</i> types of games it is routine these days to get games on day one where you have the base game, you have the near obligatory multiple-gigabyte 0 day patch applied to deal with problems found between gold master and actual release, and then you still have obvious crash bugs, serious problems with animation systems, physics systems, etc.  Connection issues with backend services are just one of a very long list of game breaking problems, many of which are seen in totally offline single-player games.<p>The whole &quot;preorder&quot; culture for gaming is a large factor in this problem, IMO.  There&#x27;s not that much incentive to ship a product that is solid when you&#x27;ve already gotten a large amount of the money you will get on release before the product even ships.  This is even more evident in all the failed kickstarters where people have paid for alpha-level games that were never released or evolved much past where they were at the time of fund raising.<p>To a large degree the gamers are thus to blame for perpetuating this problem due to buying into the preorder culture (presumably in order to avoid loss aversion due to missing out on preorder bonuses).",1444521454

For those of you who are in Computer Science/Engineering: What major do you recommend I should switch to in order to learn extra useful and applied skills that will increase my chances to land a good job in industry (and also where I will be using and benefiting from my math background)?<p>2. Is Computer Science (Machine Learning/Data Mining) the best option to switch to (in your opinion) for someone with a strong math background?<p>3. Do you know other areas within computer science that have promising job opportunities and where I can apply my math background?<p>4. Do you recommend I should get a Bachelor’s Degree (which will last only two years because there are many Canadian Universities that offer Bachelor’s Degrees in Computer Science as a Second Degree) in Computer Science instead of Master’s Degree? I heard that employers like to hire people with Bachelors only because they don’t have to pay them much (among other reasons), unlike the people with Masters who are regarded as OVERQUALIFIED by many employers<p>5. Are you aware of any good Master’s programs in Canada In computer science/engineering that you recommend I should apply to for Fall 2016?

We ended up at some gas station, as all other stores were closed, and tried to buy alcohol.<p>Some people were standing there, too, waiting in a queue, some of them migrants, some obviously homeless, some kinda nice dressed.<p>A friend of mine tried to pay with her EC card, and was too drunk to use it or enter her PIN – so she asked if someone of the other crowd would be able to help her (I, myself, was also quite drunk). So she gave this guy her wallet, told him to &quot;take out the yellow EC card, PIN is 2814&quot;[1], and indeed, he did this.<p>They – also wanting to buy alcohol – asked us if we wanted to follow them to a nearby party.

and now I&#x27;m working on compilers and compiler optimizations in a different industry.<p>You cannot compare that at all.<p>With engine simulation and control you have real-time loops, with the biggest problem being the latency. You reduce latency by getting better HW, better sensors, shorter distances, a better SW driver architecture.
You don&#x27;t optimize by finding patterns or counting occurrences at all, esp. not at run-time. You always have to be prepared for the worst case.
Plus you always have HW + SW combined. Any major important SW feature is always doubled in HW for security. It&#x27;s a different world.<p>With compilers there&#x27;s no real-time trouble (GC&#x27;s, ha!), mostly no loops, no worry about HW, cables, sensors or drivers. It&#x27;s pure abstraction.
With JIT compilers it&#x27;s a bit different, mostly a tradeoff memory + optimization overhead vs speed. More measurements and dynamic decisions.
But jit optimization in engine control? Nah.
And there&#x27;s never a HW cross check. Signals, interrupts may arrive or get lost. The machine will not hard reset and reboot if a signal gets lost. 
It does so in a car or in space or other industrial control environments.",1444519787

But you&#x27;ll never read about video game architecture in an architecture journal, design blog, etc. It&#x27;s a universal aversion to serious conversations about games just because they involve shooting aliens.<p>Can development psychologists get out of the ghetto of investigating games&#x27; impact on violence or attention deficit? Maybe. Studies like the one done in this article are a good step forward. But this study still indicts video games for something, just different video games. The improvement-in-vision studies are on the right track, but they are at this point half a decade old. Surely someone has some fresh ideas.<p>Those game developers haven&#x27;t read a single page of psychology literature.

Otherwise your tests will not be worth much. Either you play back a recorded existing course (RPS - road profile sequences) or you simulate it, simple steady state and transient cycles. We are automating reproducible test conditions.<p>But we are here only talking about the different emission tests, where we have 2 major philosophies. The european emission test tracks (NECD), which is also used in India and Asia, which is an highly abstract test with the engine alone driven by a similator simulating multiple real-world driving conditions (a few urban cycles) and the american test on a dyno with a real driver (with varying cycles), so that the american car manifacturers, who traditionally were not so good in designing emission-free engines could traditionally cheat by hiring the best drivers to pass the test.<p>So Americans have cheated historically the most, but apparently engine manifacturers which couldn&#x27;t catch up with modern diesel engine development had to cheat also. First it is trivial to cheat, since the test has to be done only once. This is entirely a political game to get the NOx and COx values down, but don&#x27;t harm their own industries. And esp. Americans seldom use scientifically based values.<p>And then you have cold starts in reality, which is mostly not tested in the emission cycles tests. Emissions will always be higher in the field than with a properly warmed up engine under lab conditions. So it&#x27;s no surprise that different measurement methods will lead to different results.",1444518715

To the best we can ascertain, we only have subjective experiences of perceptions of electromagnetic phenomena. We don&#x27;t get to perceive physical reality, only our own interpretation of what is postulated as an image of the physical reality.<p>It appears that there can be no proof either way whether a physical reality actually exists or not.

We can hypothesize that it arises from some other &quot;thing&quot;, but there is no way we can know.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure anyone in this thread chain has claimed that consciousness goes beyond physical reality.

It is now safer for children to be out alone at younger ages than ever before. The odd thing is that paranoia is at an all time high.  Leaving a five-year-old unsupervised, even at home, is flirting with a visit from child protective services. There is less to protect children from than ever before, but parents are more protective than ever. It has reached the point that same are concerned that today&#x27;s children aren&#x27;t given enough freedom to experiment and fail.<p>This is not by choice.  It is enforced by society and law. Consider what would happen if you sent a three-year-old out on an errand as is done in Japan.  A child that age, alone on the street, will attract attention, primarily of the concerned and meddling kind.  The child will be asked where their parents are and promptly returned to them.  The parents will be chewed out for reckless child endangerment as a bare minimum.<p>While one can argue today&#x27;s child-associated paranoia is a result of fear-mongering by the media, the real problem is that it&#x27;s backed up by the law. Parents who are too trusting and permissive will soon find themselves in court.  That has to change.",1444518002

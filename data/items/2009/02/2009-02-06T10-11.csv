Would you have it professionally framed and hang it on your wall to look at and remind you of your courage and incorruptibility? All you would need for that, Clarice, is a mirror.""<p>Self-esteem and intrinsic motivation are so much more powerful than extrinsic incentives. All these karma systems can do is, at best, reflect how people feel about themselves. The real challenge is to have a community that attracts the right people. Then, the karma system will show the quality of the community.",1233917813

469601,comment,469584,469588,0,0,swombat,,,"That's a very good point. I guess it depends on a number of other factors.<p>In our case, we can see a much larger very-targeted, high value advertising opportunity if we do manage to saturate our niche - so user spread is very important, and if we could we would even offer it for free to grab the market share (unfortunately, if we do that we'll run out of money before we get a chance to bring in the advertising).<p>I can see how for many other kinds of businesses, this would change dramatically.",1233915946

469596,comment,467972,468432,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Hey! I'd dispute it was trolling. That's extremely offensive, I'd ask you to retract the comment. It <i>was</i> rash and strongly (and probably badly) worded.<p>> Is organizing a lobby to campaign to shut down their web ads censorship?<p>Yes: if the aim is to get someone to shut them down then it is an attempt at censorship (and if they succeed it <i>is</i>). That is not, and I believe wheel would agree here, simply a boycott anymore.<p>> Is voting for such a law censorship?<p>That's a difficult question. I'd probably say yes.. but I'd want it to actually happen before acusing everyone (so you could check motives etc.)<p>I've admitted I was wrong to call it censorship - but I do still think it's getting a lot more press than it deserves. Lots of people ""boycott"" GoDaddy for non-religious reasons (some in protest at the adverts - comments here are testament to that) and have been doing so for a long while. Why is it such a big deal now? Because this guy ""represents"" religion.. which is media friendly.<p>Indeed these ads have been around for a while: why is it such a big problem now?<p>It's certainly the perfect basis for the lobby group (and I am sure the Christian lobby groups will sieze on it at some point :)).<p>I think in a democracy that people forget it is ""majority rule"". You are, of course, entitled to your own opinions and ideas of what is right (that, though, is probably not <i>part</i> of the democracy per se). But you view does not <i>represent</i> everyones unless a majority of people agree with it.<p>Therefore IMO it is wrong to try and turn a legitimate boycott on personal grounds into an attempt to impose your morals onto the majority. I would say that most people either do not care or enjoy the ads (probably mostly in the former category).<p>The person in question did not write the letter in a way to say ""I am not using your service any more, this is why"" he wrote from the perspective of ""your offending out sensibilities so please change or we'll stop using you"". Which is a threat in my eyes :D",1233915841

469592,comment,469320,469536,0,0,jbert,,,"> I know there is one glaring problem here<p>More than one, really. State schools in the UK are incentivised in a way similar to this.<p>What it results in is gaming of the performance measures.<p>For example, pupils are steered into softer subjects where results are easier to attain. Pupils below-but-close-to a grade increment are given more intensive teaching at the expense of those who will attain the relevant grade left to their own devices.<p>Push that down to the per-teacher level and good teachers would not want to work with difficult pupils, since they will get poor results and less pay. ""So make the pay conditional on <i>improvement</i> rather than absolute attainment"". OK, in which case you've just made an incentive for children to be labeled as behaviourally difficult and academically poor so that they can be improved more.<p>Want to get better teachers? Pump more damn money in. Get good managers and get good quality people teaching. Make it a profession people aspire to work in once more.<p>The thing is, you'll have to keep it up for about a generation (with not much to show for it), to flush the system through. Good luck with that politically.<p>Markets are not a panacea. Particularly so with subjective measures.<p>Education (in the broader sense of what we want to achieve) is subjective - even academic results are more subjective than one might think - how many mathematics qualifications is a history qualification of the same level 'worth'?",1233915454

469589,comment,469435,469435,0,0,zupatol,,,"The article links the anti-ad movement to anti-capitalist feelings.<p>Advertising is not essential to capitalism. While economists built countless models that show the superiority of competition and free markets, advertising is something they have barely studied. One of the fundamental assumptions of most models is that consumer preferences are fixed. Advertising works by changing user preferences, so the typical economic model will not be able to say anything about its effect on the economy.<p>I studied economics in the early nineties, and I remember having a look at the literature about advertising. There was a study that showed cigarette companies competed only through advertising, leading only to higher prices, not to better products. Another study showed that the introduction of advertising for glasses led to lower prices, and concluded that in that case advertising had helped competition work better. I think there was one weird model that somehow argued advertising was good because it allowed people to enjoy life more.<p>I concluded that there is a good part and a bad part of advertising. The good part is conveying information that helps making better choices. The bad part is bringing products to your attention regardless if they are good or not. My personal impression is that the bad part drowns out the good one.",1233915048
469588,comment,469584,469586,0,0,jacquesm,,,"That makes very good sense at first reading, but the exact reason <i>why</i> software was such a successful product in the first place is because the real profits are in decoupling that 'paying for what costs you money' relationship and to focus on getting people to pay something for something that costs you very little to nothing but has perceived value for them.<p>Otherwise you'll always be a marginal business at best.<p>To illustrate that with the software example, the costs were in the development, but people ended up paying big time for the distribution media.<p>Real multipliers are not found in the 'pay for what you use' arena, they are more likely to be found in exactly the opposite direction.",1233914818

469585,comment,468051,468491,0,0,cschwarm,,,"I'm living in Europe -- Germany to be exact -- but never noticed any ""elitist"" European-style system for a University degree. So I digged out some numbers. This is hard to translate, so my apologies for bad grammer.<p>In Germany in 2006, 43,4% of people born in a certain year managed to make the necessary degree to be able go to a higher education system (universities, etc.). This is quite a difference to the 5-15% you assume to be ""usual"".<p>Additionally, the majority of universities here are public schools, with (recently introduced) fees of about 1000 Euros per year. This is also quite a difference to your assumption that 85% of students go to a private college.<p>Additionally, some traditional German qualifications (""Meisterprüfung"", for example) are taught in other school forms, that are considered to be a university degree elsewhere.<p>Looking at the other European countries, the numbers are different, of course. That's party due to the fact that some countries require collage degrees for certain jobs not necessary elsewehere. In Sweden and Finland, for example, nurses seem to need one. In Finland, up to 71% of people born in a certain year seem to start a college education.<p>For other numbers, please see the fourth table here: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/dn22rh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/dn22rh</a>. The third column indicates how many percent of people born in a certain year start a higher degree. For example, it was 32% in Belgium according to the 2001 OECD study.",1233914519

We are made of coordinated, replicating cells.  They happen to be in a mutual &quot;truce&quot; to act as one organism at the expense of individual cell survival.  Most cells that break the truce do badly on their own and die out.  However, given enough tries at the prize, some cells will find a way to beat the system and replicate at the expense of the other cells still serving the whole body.<p>Some people have genetic deficiencies that give potentially malignant cells a jump start on the process.  Certain environmental exposures will increase the rate of errors and therefore the frequency of tries that cells will get to become cancerous.  But the outcome will always be the same; as we prolong human life through better medical care the incidence of cancer can only rise.<p>It would be most accurate to say that cancer is an evolutionary phenomenon that occurs between cells of a multicellular organism and causes a heterogenous group of diseases.",1400824596

7788146,comment,7787707,7787707,3,0,callmeed,,,"A lot a good insights in this article. Some random thoughts:<p>We have a company here in SLO with a network of niche ecommerce sites (<a href=""http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/</a> and similar). It was founded before Amazon and they&#x27;re making <i>a ton</i> of money. You just don&#x27;t hear about it in startupland.<p>Obviously the author is a little biased about the proprietary merch. angle. Personally, I think NastyGal and ModCloth (and similar like Ruche) are going to be big winners (i.e. IPO). They have huge loyalty and are already moving into the proprietary merchandise angle where the author puts Bonobos (NastyGal has their own line of clothes now).<p>I love Warby Parker but they will need to move beyond just glasses at some point.<p>One sector I&#x27;ve never understood is the flash sale sites. To me, they seem nothing more than an ecommerce version of Ross/TJ Maxx/Marhalls/outlet stores with some pretty CSS. Granted, TJX and Ross are both public companies with double-digit billion market caps, so there&#x27;s something. I just never found them intriguing personally.<p>EBay seems like the one that really needs to get up-ended. I know a lot of startups are trying to do it via mobile–but is that the best route? I bet most of these other up-and-coming players still do the bulk of their business via desktop browsers vs smartphone (would LOVE any metrics anyone has on this).",1400823833

My only point was that the &#x27;1 billion&#x27; number is quite misleading, because I will dispute you on the &quot;unleashing people&#x27;s imagination&quot; part. The problem I see in your argument is that you are comparing yourself with a local store that sells readymade shirts. You need to compare yourself with a local tailor instead. I am not in US, so I don&#x27;t know what the market there is, but if I were to walk in any store in my country I still have more than 200 different patterns to choose from  (<a href=""http://raymondindia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raymondindia.com</a>). Also, I am not sure if getting a tailor offline is expensive or not in US. Also, one of the great factors I see is convenience. You are totally selling me your idea when you say &quot;in a few clicks&quot; and not when you say &quot;unleash your imagination&quot;. Your pricing also seems extremely reasonable and that is another selling point for me.<p>Everything aside, I really think your app is great and I would definitely give it a try when I visit US next time (I hope you deliver it in 1-2 weeks, because that is generally how long my trips are) :)",1400823450

Then got a job where they required me to provide my own.\nMy first phone purchase was the first generation SideKick Color, and I loved it! I still have the SideKick II that replaced it (I traded my original one in on it pre-public-release). I still have the external camera that plugged into the SK Color&#x27;s headphone jack too.<p>The screen was gimmicky, but oh-so-cool... it got everyone&#x27;s attention, and allowed me to show people what it could do. Everyone was impressed - until they asked about ringtones. T-Mobile&#x27;s laser-focus on hip-hop was a real blow there... I&#x27;m not into it, nor were any of the people I showed the device to. It really turned people away from it when they realized the target market was teenagers (even though it was an awesome techie&#x27;s device).<p>The terminal program was my favorite part (I was a Unix Systems Architect at the time) and it got a great deal of (ssh) use.<p>I loved reading through the various descriptions of the apps being developed on the developers site (skdr?) and waited so patiently for T-Mobile to give the green light to so many of them (including a super-simple one, the voice-note-recorder), which they never did. I tried to get my own developer status (can&#x27;t remember the term they used) so I could get a key and load the apps directly onto my device (via usb), but that was shortly after T-Mobile had made the process extremely difficult with huge forms to fill out and some catch-22 requirement that you had to already have a program published to get the dev kit (or something like that). I read a <i>lot</i> of complaints about that.<p>The best part of the device was the keyboard. It had the best layout and by far the best feel (and spacing) of any phone thumb-keyboard I&#x27;ve used since. Better than the Nokia N800 (NIT, not phone), better than the original Android G1, even better than the N900. It&#x27;s the only thumb-keyboard I ever used that I could type on without looking at the keyboard, and quickly... far more quickly than anything remotely similar that I&#x27;ve tried.<p>After they cut the service, I used mine as a dumb-phone for a while until the microphone finally stopped working. That forced me to finally get a replacement (my N900).<p>One thing that&#x27;s pretty impressive about the SideKick II... mine is <i>still running</i> (never been rebooted) since before T-mobile cut the service! I&#x27;ve had it plugged in the entire time for fear that if the battery dies, it will lose the games and programs I have installed (it acted sort-of as a thin client and downloaded all apps you had allocated upon powerup).<p>Pretty darned amazing uptime, considering what it was. :)",1400823370

Yes, you could frame everything as &#x27;prediction&#x27; but basically all you are doing is conflating &#x27;prediction&#x27; with &#x27;agency with a time delay.&#x27; This really doesn&#x27;t solve any problems. At what timescale you want to draw the line between prediction and agency for closed loop systems is an open question. I think one of the key concepts that the author fails to address is that the fundamental problem the nervous system addresses is coordination of otherwise isolated muscles, organs etc. While we may remain mystified about the function of the mind, we do know that at some level the nervous system is really about control and synchronization. There are astoundingly good models (now with biological correlates!) of motor control loops that are just classic PID controllers. While the predictive perspective can be useful in some cases it is just a perspective and an interpretation.

I think CrossFit is ridiculous as well, but when I saw the OP listing deadlifts as a low reward for high risk, it instantly throws into question their knowledge of the subject at hand.<p>A deadlift done with proper form is one of the safest exercises you can do with free weights, because there&#x27;s no chance of failure resulting in the bar and weight falling on you like could happen with a squat or press.<p>They&#x27;re dangerous with poor form, but anyone doing any sort of exercise should make sure they&#x27;re doing it properly. Deadlift form is pretty simple, as well. The problem is if you&#x27;re not focused, things can go poorly, as others have commented. Stay focused, stay safe.<p>And as for the reward part, there&#x27;s probably not any other single exercise that provides so much potential gain in strength and muscle mass. Squats, presses, and rows fall shortly behind. Compound lifts are excellent in general and minimize your risk of injury compared to simple lifts that do not strengthen stabilizer muscles, etc.",1400822877

Yes, a lot of people were dissing tunnels yesterday. I&#x27;m actually a big fan of tunnels. I think the way the IPv4 Internet was built originally was basically by tunneling over the phone system. Ignore, you know, getting leased lines, putting computers on the end, building a network with no cooperation at all from the phone company. In fact, I once saw a phone company memo that referred to the Internet as a &#x27;hostile overlay&#x27;. You know, and we basically, you know, demolished their billing plans and everything, and built this network in spite of the desires of the carriers. And, as I see the IPv4 Internet getting more and more like the phone company, I thought one way to deploy IPv6 is basically tunnel over all that junk. Iterate the same thing again. And I gather, you know, some people, you know, who are concerned about this are looking at other ways of sort evolving the Internet, where you, you know, tunnel over HTTP or whatever you have to do to basically get over all that cruft and build a new network on top of it. So that, to me, was one possible way, you know, as the IPv4 Internet rotted the underneath. We would tunnel over it and then we would throw away the rotted bits and replace them with wires.&quot;<p>[1] &quot;Internet as a &#x27;Hostile Overlay&#x27;&quot; -> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwRVNwa6nJc#t=11m07s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwRVNwa6nJc#t=11m07s</a>",1400821633

You can only write javascript in the browser (anyone who writes in Go <i>has</i> to be fundamentally opposed to hacks like coffeescript).<p>I write Go on the server to serve pages, and write rich front ends using simple javascript and jQuery. Being able to do nice quick page fetches means I don&#x27;t get into massive complexity on the front end with a bloated single-page app, and not trying to deal with front-end complexity on the server means my server routes stay nice and simple.<p>I use Gocraft/web on the server because it&#x27;s a useful library not an opinionated framework, and IMHO the most Go-idiomatic of the options (I tried them all and it was a toss-up between Gorilla and Gocraft/web, which won because of the really simple, useful context and middleware paradigm).<p>Creating API endpoints and page routes is simple and easy, and then writing the javascript to call endpoints when needed is simple (once I&#x27;d learned to stop jQuery from appending my data to the url and put it in the request body!).<p>My only gripe about the mix is that GoConvey doesn&#x27;t integrate with Jasmine so I have to run two test suites.",1400821407

So, even if you win, the shell company will declare bankruptcy.<p>I think you&#x27;ve hit on it. Anyone who proclaims patents are bad overall are not considering that the real problem is the shell companies, &quot;patent trolls&quot;, who are taking advantage of a system that was intended to encourage good faith between businesses; these shell companies are the real problem. The law needs to go after them with the &quot;pierce the corporate veil&quot; mantra.",1400821301

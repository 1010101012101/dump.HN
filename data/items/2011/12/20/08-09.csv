3372796,comment,3372503,3372628,7,0,InclinedPlane,,,"North Korea is very much a totalitarian regime in every sense of the word. Everything flows from the state. Food. News. Entertainment. Education. Jobs. Everything. And it has been totalitarian for around 2/3rds of a century. It's very difficult to fight against something so ingrained and omni-present.<p>From without it's also difficult to imagine toppling the North Korean regime. To do so would almost inevitably result in quite literally hundreds of thousands of dead South Korean civilians in a matter of hours (through artillery). And perhaps just as many dead South Korean, Japanese, Taiwanese, or American civilians dead through a nuclear attack. That sort of cold calculus makes it very hard to make the decision to end the DPRK regime.",1324371509

After all, those who have known Kim Jong Il since youth are bound to see him as human -- not the center of a god-like cult of personality.""<p>In the new Steve Jobs biography, Walter Isaacson quotes Steve on why he didn't let his parents come to his school's campus: ""I didn't want anyone to know I had parents. I wanted to be like an orphan who had bummed around the country on trains and just arrived out of nowhere, with no roots, no connections, no background.""<p>Interesting how powerful people manipulate the story of how they got to be where they are.

I used to keep an IFAK on me and also a larger buttpack-style medical kit to put under a pack.<p>I'm kind of sad that I lost one of my good Italian army blankets at the vehicle accident the other night -- I didn't want it back after it was covered in a random person's blood and glass, and she was still using it.  Annoyingly most of the good surplus sources for heavy wool blankets have gone dry.<p>I keep a minor-injuries kit for definitive care for minor comfort things (some small bandaids, OTC medications, wet wipes, etc.) separate from an actual trauma kit (well, one in cabin and a bigger one in the trunk) (4-8 israeli dressings, 2 Combat Application Tourniquets, some rolls of gauze, sterile blades, catheter/needle for tension pneumothorax, cpr mask (which I'd only really use on sketchy random people who appear ill, otherwise IMO its a waste of time, although in a bigger kit a BVM would be great), some needles, some nitrile gloves, surgical tape, duct tape, 2 SAM splints, hot and cold packs).  Add to that the other normal zombie/earthquake/etc. things (heavy trash bags, crowbar, and trauma-causing implements), and I am really happy to have a car vs. take public transit.<p>Also, a case or two of water and sports drink (gatorade) is really useful in the car.

Here are three examples:<p>Clipboard hijacking: Remember Tynt?  They hijacked your clipboard to say ""Read more at <link>"" or some nonsense.  That is not what I copied, and you are breaking my expectations by modifying it.  Gruber has a much better post on this (<a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2010/05/tynt_copy_paste_jerks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2010/05/tynt_copy_paste_jerks</a>), but essentially: knock it off.  Don't try and manipulate your reader.<p>Information panels: If I doubleclick a word, it's because I'm marking my place in an article, or I intend to copy and paste that word.  To offer any sort of popup or panel gets in my way, and causes me annoyance.  This is not the expected behavior, and I'm far less likely to continue reading the article or website if this happens.<p>Tracking: I don't know how bad yours is, but with Apture it was just one more company tracking me.  There's already Google +1, Facebook like buttons, and Analytics on every page - and this is just one more thing to slow down my page and turn my data usage into statistics.  I don't like it.  I can enable Noscript, but I shouldn't have to.<p>You may say that these are features that your users (Cloudflare customers) want, but I'm sorry - they're morons.  I deal with clients who would eat these kinds of features up, ""they'll set us apart from other websites!"".  No.  It only hurts the end users, and does not provide useful features.<p>And it really concerns me that Google bought Apture, I often use Chrome and do not want to see this integrated at any level.

A couple observations:<p>1) Making the TOS presented so prominently is a bit surprising and imposing.  Their placement makes me wonder whether this is a cute, harmless gift or something worse.  I know Google's ""Don't Be Evil,"" but this site is run by someone else...<p>2) This isn't Google.  This is some company that Google's marketing department contracted.  If you look at the source page, you see this is running on stock AWS and might even have been an ""off-the-shelf"" solution Google added their name to.<p>While I have faith Google set up a reasonable contract to protect my info, I don't know or trust the third party to handle my information properly.<p>3) Maybe it's the geek in me, but I'd be 100x more excited if some employees put this together during their 20% time.  Seeing that it's clearly a marketing bit end-to-end means I almost don't want to share it with friends.<p>4) It would have been nice to download the MP3 and send it over email myself.  A phone call is a nice way to advertise Google Voice, but it sure is hard to share with friends and family after the event.<p>5) Related to the MP3, it doesn't include any of the advertising or promotional messaging I would expect during the preview.  I would like to know the entire experience I'm sending to my loved one, not just the personalized message.  If it requires my loved one to submit an email address or listen to 30 second advertising, I may not want my loved one to hear it.

3372754,comment,3372166,3372166,3,0,Natsu,,,"> Primary funding for the website will be provided by website owners and copyright holders,<p>So there's now a tax to run a website.  And we centralize control over the whole internet via DMCA.org?  We're climbing a steep hill here and we've barely started.  Also, you realize that sites can be served via compromised computers... right?  Who answers for those?  Not a big problem, you say?  Well, aside from the botnets and such already out there that you apparently don't know about.  And we're creating new incentives to create such things, too....<p>> Each website has a DMCA score based on complaints, response times and repeat violations, and websites with ""mass infringement"" status may be blocked<p>I assume you have the Pirate Bay in mind, but pretty much any popular user-generated site drowns in complaints already.  And many of them already have tools that big rightsholders can use.  So do we shut down YouTube?  Viacom tried to.<p>Finally, there's all this stuff about ""blocking.""  You're assuming that you <i>can</i> make a block that works.  Problem is, you <i>can't</i>.  If there's one source in all the world, it's enough for everyone.  You can't block 99% of the world, because that last 1% will share copies with the rest.  There are no filters on sneakernet.  You vastly underestimate the bandwidth of a truck full of DVDs.  The government couldn't stop the spread of thousands of classified cables with the military at their disposal.  China can't stop dissidents from getting through the Great Firewall.  I've watched, for basically my entire life, as people came up with the same ideas, then hit the same failures.  For every wall you put up, someone will create a ladder or a tunnel.  Even Sisyphus didn't have it that bad.<p>You can't really make piracy significantly harder, but you can make buying things easier.  Look at iTunes:  I doubt there's a single thing on there that can't be found somewhere online for free.  Yet they're a huge success because it's fast, easy & convenient.  Make it easy to buy, easy to use, fun to experience.  The pirates can't copy <i>you</i>, and successful performers make use of that, too.<p>But get your fans caught in the crossfire when you're trying to make things harder to pirate and they'll abandon you for an artist who treats them well.  They're not pirates:  they can, will and have bought from people who treated them well.  But if you screw them when going after pirates, well, there's a <i>lot</i> of other music out there to buy and they don't need yours.  Reminding potential customers that they don't need to listen to your music is not great for conversion, incidentally.  But don't take my word for it, run an A/B test and see.<p>That said, you're absolutely right that things need fixing.  But a far more realistic approach would be to fix copyright itself.  William Patry (a famous lawyer & scholar of all things copyright) has a new book with some interesting thoughts on that:<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Fix_Copyright.html?id=8-4catWPy84C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Fix_Copyright.htm...</a><p>Like he says, ""the proxy battle for control of technology and markets through copyright laws must stop.""",1324369869

But failures in production or transportation of goods will result in reduced availability. Also, centralized production drains the money to one place, namely the industrial area, and the local people might not have the money to continuously support buying these rags.<p>The other end is a distributed set of decentralized small-scale production fragments that produces local goods locally. The scheme will yield a higher local efficiency even if the total country-wide production of all units combine is more inefficient. It will recirculate local money more efficiently and boost local economy, again a local maxima, and this will allow more local people to buy the goods which was the whole point of this grassroots manufacturing. Also, production outages in one unit will not cause reduced availability since only a fraction of total production will be offline.<p>It gets fun to find analogies that fit this pattern.

3372724,comment,3372166,3372591,3,0,int3rnaut,,,"I think one way to look at the issue of piracy is to think of it like smoking in that it affects the utility of society--it's a cultural issue that has to be handled by the law but more importantly the newer generations. You can't just ""stop it"", it has to be grandfathered out because just like smoking was (or even is), the problem is systemic.<p>People started weighing the utility of smoking--and most rational people came to the conclusion that collectively it probably wasn't something we should be doing so they started picking away at the issue one cig at a time through legislation, programming, education, and taxation. And there was huge opposition too, especially by the people puffing away. It's taken years, and generations, but smoking is in a definite decline--hell, teenagers in my country (Canada) have stopped smoking twofold in the past 10 years as we're down from 24% to 12%--that's a big leap, but again it's a slow process. It's gotten to the point where smoking isn't cool.<p>What I'm trying to get at here is that the goal shouldn't be to stop piracy right this instant, that's an impossible task because it is so ingrained into our culture (especially young people like me, and yes, ""shifty eyes"" I said like me) it should be to systemically weed out the issue over time--and what the OP is doing, challenging the status-quo, and offering suggestions on how to help fix the problem is a step in the right direction (there are flaws, but he noted that); one cig at a time. You might think that piracy doesn't affect the greater utility of the world like say smoking does--there aren't health risks, but there are risks of losing our liberties (look at this madness!), risks of penalty and persecution, risk of moral degredation--not to mention the risks we don't even know about. And when I think of what the internet could potentially be because of SOPA I wonder if it's worth the few songs, or movies, or whatever each of us takes from the pile. I am sure there was a time when parents sitting in a crowded restaurant with young kids all around, smoke just filled in the air, wondered if that tiny bit of enjoyment they got from that lit object was worth it at that time too. And just like those parents then, I don't want newer generations to have to deal with long term consequences of my bits of joy.<p>Anyways Mr. Flores thanks for posting this, I like it when people try to honestly work towards a better future. Your idea probably won't get traction, but think about it as continuing that slow and daunting process of removing one bit at a time.<p>-signed a dumb kid who's never smoked",1324368937

Coincidentally I was just pondering doing the exact same thing today so I can tell you it would be useful for others. Mine was to be billed as a tool for web designers and social media people to give to their clients as an easy way for them to keep up with their accounts and as a selling point for the people setting it up. I don't mind if you run with that idea either as I probably won't execute very soon.<p>There are a bunch of companies beholden to Facebook and Twitter for similar reasons as you and the ones who are successful are able to enhance the experience in some way that the company providing the API isn't willing to get into. Zynga is good example. The problem is that if you're not big enough then they don't give a shit. If you have a sizable portion of their users and are providing something that keeps people using their platform then you're good. Check out Buffer. Buffer let's you spread out Tweets over time and I'm pretty sure it posts to Facebook too. Somehow they've managed to avoid the pitfalls. But you're saying the Twitter API won't let Tweets come from your app? That's weird because that's exactly what Buffer does and I haven't seen them have any problem. I haven't looked into it but maybe you can go about asking for an exception. You really have to make a great case though.<p>But to finally give a straight answer I'd say that if it's important enough to you then you should definitely deal with the uncertainty. Find a model that gives you a kind of partner status rather than a leach status in their eyes. Brizzly, Buffer, and Zynga somehow navigated the territory so I think you could too.",1324368898

Now, is that what you would call ""hard-wired""?<p>I don't pretend to know whether you are born gay, or if it's something environmental during your childhood, or whether it really is more flexible than some people like to admit.

It cannot be changed. There is a binary; you are either this way, or you are that way. And that's just not how people work; at least, behaviorally, for the vast majority of behaviors.

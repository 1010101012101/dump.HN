Node.js + expressjs is quite an efficient option for serving API and the static site on Heroku, only the single free dyno is needed for over 3 million installs and peaks of 30-40k site visits. Only rarely have we needed a second or third dyno under an extremely heavy peak traffic period.<p>2.

4233790,comment,4232505,4232505,36,0,stickfigure,,,"My company is one of the early adopters of Persona/BrowserID.  You can see our dual-auth (with Facebook) system here:<p><a href=""https://www.voo.st/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.voo.st/</a><p>We've been live for several months now in the Real World - our userbase (amateur athletes) is primarily nontechnical.  About half of our users choose Persona/BrowserID and half choose Facebook.  We were initially concerned about the BID login flow (in particular, the immediate email roundtrip) but it hasn't been a problem and the UX has been refined quite a lot over the last month or two.<p>For a mass-consumer audience, the combined FB/Persona solution is excellent:<p>* Facebook unquestionably has the slickest auth experience, even eliminating the followup name/sex/bday questions.  However, a significant percentage of the world (possibly > 25%) either Hates Facebook or wants to keep their Facebook account isolated.  This is unlikely to change in the near future and could even get worse depending on what sleeping dogs Zuckerberg decides to kick next week.  We don't have the option of alienating the FB haters and we wouldn't want to anyways.<p>* The Persona UX is good and rapidly getting better.  BigTent integration with gmail, yahoo, hotmail will bring one-click login to those users.  A native experience is being built into browser chrome.  All this is coming without me having to write code.  It may not be as slick as Facebook, but I like where this train is headed.<p>* Integration is simple compared to writing a username/password system.  The API is incredibly easy to work with.  Dual-auth with Facebook is a little more complicated, but a complete Persona-based auth system is a question of hours, not days.<p>* The fact that identity is just an email address makes it easier to integrate with existing login systems.  In our system, you can log into the same account with both Facebook and Persona as long as the emails match.  No, email is not a perfect identifier, but even nontechnical users understand it immediately and really - what other option is there?  ""What email address did I use?"" is a lot better than ""What weird combination of letters and numbers did I use as a login name?""<p>* Support on the Mozilla dev-identity list has been fantastic.<p>We're pretty happy.  Honestly, I don't ever see myself writing another username/password login system ever again.  Persona is less work for a better UX.",1342086651

4233787,comment,4233505,4233755,1,0,randomdata,,,"Indeed. Since the article mentioned cell phones: I would say on average, it costs about $200/year to own a smartphone (service not included). $6000 if you maintain that for 30 years. Yet I cannot imagine paying $2,000 for a smartphone that will provide uninterrupted service for 30 years. It is far cheaper to have the single upfront cost, but the technology progresses so rapidly that your device probably won't even work with the communications systems of the day by then. It makes a huge difference on what you are buying.<p> Realistically more like $15,000+ if you start to include the costs of not having that money, but we'll keep the calculations simple.",1342086549

4233785,comment,4233505,4233505,3,0,Wilya,,,"I definitely disagree. Maybe sometimes, paying twice as much gives you something that lasts ten times longer. Or maybe, you will pay five times as much, and get something that (hopefully) lasts a bit longer.<p>I use a lot of earphones, and they tend to break quite fast. Once or twice, I decided to move away from the usual 15$ models and pay 60$ for better brands, with good reviews, and everything. Did they last longer ? Of course not. They sounded marginally better, but nothing worth the price..<p>The thing is, price is an indicator of positioning. It's a marketing tool, and it's generally not correlated to quality. Buying the very cheapest is usually not a good idea, because the manufacturer probably did everything it could to actually beat competitors and propose the lowest price. But other than that, that's pretty much all you can know in advance.<p>Knowing what items are made of good quality and will last longer (and therefore are worth paying an extra for) is very hard.

4233781,comment,4233467,4233658,2,0,mtgx,,,"Agreed. Microsoft is on a much slower development pace than Chrome and Mozilla, which theoretically shouldn't affect how how many features they build in the next version that comes a year later.<p>I mean let's say Chrome implements 1 major feature every 6 weeks, so that's 8 major features they add in a whole year for Chrome. So even if Microsoft doesn't update their browser every 6 weeks, but only once a year or once every 2 years, that doesn't mean they shouldn't have a similar amount of new features in the new version. But instead, they have significantly fewer. Even in IE10 there are a lot of things missing that have already been implemented in Chrome and Firefox, or are about to, and since they are not coming in IE, that means devs will have to wait another 2 years or more for them to arrive in IE11.",1342086406
4233780,comment,4233647,4233647,2,0,HarrietJones,,,"Good article, though I don't agree with it all.<p>It is harder to grow software than it is to initially build it. Preconceptions bite you on the ass, data structures don't allow for new features, side effects multiply.<p>You don't need to learn the layers. In fact, if you're learning all the layers, you're probably an innefective coder. This is not to say that you shouldn't investigate the layers or have a poke around the layers.

I have some costco brand jeans I bought during the first dot-com that I still wear.  they were under $15.  Actually, at the same time I bought a bunch of designer jeans.   The designer jeans all failed (at least one of them catastrophically... dramatically ripping the crotch wide open as I lifted a server in front of something of a crowd.) within a year of purchase.<p>My experience has been that expensive things are not always better.  In fact, expensive clothing is usually designed for rich people, who don't need to lift things  or trace cables through crawlspaces, and who will want clothing of the new style next year anyhow.<p>Clothing designed for working people is usually much more durable.  And yeah, you can sometimes get increased durability by buying something more expensive within that sector?  but the nicest dickies brand work pant is on par with the designer jeans they sell at target, price-wise.<p>So yeah, in general? if you are selecting for durability in clothing?  the price signal is actually the opposite of what you want to look at.",1342086254
4233776,comment,4233505,4233505,28,0,latch,,,"I don't agree with most of this. The idea that price equals quality has long been used by merchants to extract money from consumers, not extend value. Sure it's true of some products and some companies, but overall I'd argue that at best, more expensive things aren't close to being relatively better - by any meaningful measure.<p>A $300 meal isn't 10x better - in terms of taste (subjective obviously) or nutrition - as a $30 meal. A BMW 3 Series is a better car than a Ford Focus, but looking only at the practical reasons to own a car, it's not even close to having twice the value.<p>In a lot of cases, brand names bring no value other than the brand. And while that can have a placebo effect, it's not more value. Medicine comes to mind as a great example. You are paying more for marketing and packaging than you are for R&D. The recent thread on memristors even highlighted that R&D costs are 1/100th of total cost, with marketing taking the lion's share.<p>Quality items appreciate while cheap items depreciate? No consumer good should be viewed as a financial investment. If something does appreciate in 50 years, it'll be more about luck than anything else.",1342086240

I cannot speak for other people but here are my reasons for not always going for the quality over price.<p>First, I obviously cannot always afford the high price. When I bought the car I had checked the failure reports and decided it just wasn't worth paying an additional few months salary to get the failure probability down 2-3 percent a year (checked other parameters too, similar conclusions.) And yeah, I waited till a good deal was available to me.<p>Second, getting a quality item might cost even more of my personal time - finding out which one is actually good and searching for a local vendor isn't exactly free.<p>Third, maybe I don't even want an expensive item that lasts forever. Suppose I want to get into photography but don't really know if I'll keep this hobby. I'd intentionally google ""cheap beginner dslr"" and stick with the findings. Chances are that by the time it needs replacement I'll be ready for a more fancy gear or bored with the new hobby. Win-win :)",1342085972

Browsers are just not very programmable when compared to platforms like mobile and native.<p>For example, if the user would be <i>allowed</i> by the browser to empower a web app with raw POSIX, then that would unleash an explosion of databases running in the browser, orders of magnitude better and faster than IndexedDB.<p>Sadly, this kind of innovation is currently locked up tight inside the various spec committees. For sure, developers can contribute to the mailing lists, but innovation should not be made to go through that kind of process at all in the first place. Innovation on the web needs to be decentralized not centralized. Ideally, Mozilla needs to start making that possible, by providing just the right OS-level APIs and a simple way for users to grant these to Web Apps.<p>It must be 1984 that one can use a browser, but not be allowed to give raw TCP or UDP or POSIX annointing to web apps that one trusts.<p>See Tim Berners-Lee on the subject: <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JanMar/0464.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JanMa...</a>",1342084432

4233691,comment,4233156,4233156,1,0,jmathai,,,"So I dealt with something that seemed very similar while I was at Yahoo as a Local Paranoid (security person for a product).<p>There was an enormously successful phishing attack that had rendered a crapton (more than 450k) users in a compromised state. Their passwords were basically stolen.<p>The solution was a several month long effort by multiple engineers to get the proper owner to change/reset their password. Remember, their accounts are basically hijacked at this point and they don't even know. It was one of the most involved and complex issues I've ever worked on.<p>Having gone through that I gained a lot of respect for Yahoo! and how they treat/handle these types of situations. Nowadays everything looks different so I don't know who's doing what.<p>But the more I read and think about this my guess is that all those users were phished.",1342083986

It's incompetent developers.""<p>IMO the biggest issue holding back web development is that the technology at the foundation of the web is all pretty shitty for building real applications and now we have hacks upon hacks to have a stateless protocol meant for document display to act as a full application environment.<p>Don't get me wrong, I stand in awe at the amazing things some people are able to build on this shaky foundation and I don't discount how incredible it is that the web even exists at all with buy in from all the major corporations (Google, MS, Apple, etc) who otherwise want to rip each others throats out... But at the end of the day, ignoring all of the context of history, if the web didn't exist and I asked someone to come up with a way to develop rich, secure, network-bound apps and he went to work on it for some years and the wire protocol he came up with for it was anything like HTTP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript, I'd think he was a complete moron.",1342083876

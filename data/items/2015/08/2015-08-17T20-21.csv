In this conception, it&#x27;s the ultimate parallel computer. In this conception, the guess function is actually trying all possibilities for the number d, and if any of those possibilities is a match, it says so.<p>Another way of thinking about it is as pure magic. If there is a number that&#x27;s a match, then that number comes out of the &quot;guess&quot; function <i>somehow</i>.<p>As for why we can&#x27;t use a nondeterministic Turing machine to achieve what we want, it&#x27;s because nobody knows how to build one. They&#x27;re the computing equivalent of a frictionless pulley or a mathematical point: a useful abstraction, but not something you can actually construct.

Application environments with sufficiently many workflows always reincorporate programming as a way to let the user build their own solution - and most things are implicitly programmable, whether through a defined API or through tricky reverse-engineered methods.<p>What I think muddies the picture is the line between &quot;design&quot; workflows and &quot;engineering&quot; workflows - in the first, you&#x27;re piecing together the existing technology in a different way, while in the second, you are transferring math and science knowledge into original technology. As individuals we experience personal bias as to which side of programming is more &quot;necessary,&quot; which is reflected in the resulting choices of tooling, code style, and preferred problem domains.<p>Sometimes you want design-heavy programming - e.g., you add some business logic and a UI on top of a database. Other times you want to add engineering to an existing design - you&#x27;re writing hardware drivers using a common protocol, a data formatting plugin for an application, etc.<p>Library code acts as a way to expose units of engineering, while a framework defines a broad, but still configurable design space. Sometimes you have overlapping design spaces - you can have client code that works with a GUI framework, but also talks to an internal model and remote data sources.<p>One of the things that is exciting about programming&#x27;s evolution is how much it is based on an ecosystem of technologies. Outside of some embedded fields, the era where you are given a hardware manual and are told to come up with your own development environment is over. Successful technologies tend to act parasitically on prior ones. This leads to a lot of compromises, but the general direction remains toward &quot;better fit.&quot;",1439845028

We even were using Java in 1998/99 at a pretty large scale (big 3 auto maker work) and trying to make it work on Windows Server (ouch).<p>IMO, Java and the JVM haven&#x27;t kept up with the pace of change in managed languages/environments.  Frankly when .NET was released it was worse than Java and the JVM by far but that is one place Microsoft didn&#x27;t miss the train and they really turned .NET into a power house.  Not saying .NET is perfect, but performance issues, predictability, overhead etc all seem superior to me over the JVM.   So in general I avoid writing my own code based upon a JVM centered language as I just don&#x27;t feel it is nearly as resource efficient or stable.  I&#x27;ll say that the JVM is quite tunable to help mitigate a lot of my complaints but the complexity to do it right exceeds the benefits to me when other languages can do what I want without that extra step needed.<p>I will say though, that I rely on products that are JVM based and I am open to learning some of the newer languages that also depend on the JVM.<p>FWIW as well, my core language is C++, has been for my entire career.  I still use C/C++ but most code I write is node.js with some growing golang mixed in replacing some of the C++ components we have.",1439845016

Of course, the other real problem is that a hammer will find a nail, which is why we see people getting slaughtered during traffic stops etc.<p>Definitely agree about the pigs choosing the hard way-- it&#x27;s all they know.<p>Their only strategy is escalate to force, whether in the micro situation of a traffic stop or the macro situation of rioting against police brutality. They just don&#x27;t get it, and they don&#x27;t want to get it, because they enjoy smashing heads and being unaccountable.<p>Voting aint gonna fix it, though-- most local candidates aren&#x27;t about to make a problem with the cops that they rely on, and most national candidates aren&#x27;t going to make it a problem because hey, all politics are local politics, so there&#x27;s nothing to gain. Riots and peaceful protests are the way forward now, which is tough because neither are remotely legitimate or acceptable in the US. Predictably, the police will smash the peaceful protests, causing riots, which will ultimately end in disaster.<p>We saw a bit of walkback after the Ferguson / Baltimore burnings caught national attention, but there were no formal concessions and certainly no adjustment of police training. The de facto state of affairs is actually worse off than before the riots, since now the police have realized that the public has turned against them. Maybe a few more cities will be wrecked and then there will be some serious reparation. The shit factor here is race relations, which are already being played as hard as possible in order to keep the blacks and the whites separate from each other, leaving the blacks to carry most of the burden of police reform. Obviously, this doesn&#x27;t work, because the blacks aren&#x27;t considered to be legitimate political entities when it comes to police reform specifically because they&#x27;ve borne the brunt of the drug war&#x27;s ravages.<p>In my pipe dream of police brutality being solved, we&#x27;d first need to get our national politicians to effect a formal surrender ending the drug war-- this probably won&#x27;t happen, because &quot;America never loses a war&quot;, but it&#x27;s no secret that the drug war is lost. Ending the drug war formally would open the door for demilitarization/disarmament of the losers, along with closure of the legal loopholes and abuses that allowed police to raid houses and commit warrantless wiretaps nonstop etc. Once the weapons have been removed and the law patched to revoke the wartime leeway, I think we&#x27;d be in much better shape, and could focus on normalization of police-citizen relations via force drawdown, culling of the worst abusers, and retraining of the moderate abusers. We&#x27;d have a proper (European style) police force in the next generation or so.",1439844851

Software authors then helped finish the imprimatur when they tried to work around the limitations of NAT by centralizing tools until network effects (Metcalfe&#x27;s Law) took over.<p>Promises of an &quot;open API&quot; increased this centralization, as people made the mistake of interpreting &quot;open&quot; to mean the commons (Free Software), when it really meant &quot;open access to our proprietary service that we can revoke at any time&quot;.<p>So now we are in a bad place.

Maybe you should start paying that cost now, instead of kicking this problem down the road even more when it will be even harder to fight and require and even larger sacrifice.<p>Fix this problem now, by taking a hard-line against anything enabling the digital imprimatur.

I don&#x27;t want to give Elance/UpWork too hard a time - they can be good for some things (like Data Entry, etc) but clearly their model has some issues when it comes to development projects.<p>Where our model is different is that all of our projects have a dedicated Product Manager who overseas the build for fixed-price projects. The developers and clients deal directly with the project&#x27;s PM (not with each other). That saves time for the client. It adds a layer but this counter-intuitively improves communication. I speak broken Spanish. So if I run into a Spanish speaker who speaks broken English then we can communicate. That&#x27;s fine if we&#x27;re doing something simple but if the nuance of different words matters then we&#x27;ll do much better if we have a professional translator who&#x27;s a native speaker in both languages in between us.<p>I actually interviewed the former CEO of oDesk for my blog a few years ago (long before Gigster existed) so I&#x27;ve been following this space and thinking about where it&#x27;s heading for a while.

If you want better than the built-in SATA II, but without such a high price, they also have a PCIe card that provides a SATA III interface for a 2.5&quot; drive that you supply and attach to the card. This card is only $60 [2]. This can be used for the boot drive.<p>You can also get a nice boost for external drives with a $60 PCIi card that gives you 4 external USB 3.0 ports [3]. They also have similar cards, except that instead of 4 USB 3.0, they give you 2 USB 3.0 ports and 2 eSATA III ports.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of the USB 3.0 cards from OWC are bootable. There are bootable USB 3.0 cards available from other places [4]. The key is to get one that uses the same USB 3.0 chipset that Apple uses in later Mac Pros that had USB 3.0. From what I&#x27;ve read, it appears to be the Fresco Logic FL1100.<p>My main work machine is a 2008 8-core Mac Pro, with 18 GB of RAM and an SSD. I wish it had more RAM, but other than that it should be fine for a few more years unless the hardware break.<p>My main home machine is a 2009 4-core Mac Pro, with 32 GB of RAM, and SSDs for both main drive and Time Machine, and an external 1 TB mSATA SSD in a cute little case [5] for a weekly offline backup. This machine should be fine for a few more years unless the hardware breaks, especially if I toss in one of those USB 3.0 cards mentioned above, and maybe that SATA III card for the boot drive.<p>I wish I had more RAM in the work machine, but I messed the window on that. That&#x27;s one thing to watch out for when using a machine long term. The price for a given RAM technology tends to start off high and then drop and stay low for a while...and then it tends to rise again as production is cut. Due to this, it often makes sense not to max out a machine when it is still fairly new--just get what you reasonably need. Then add RAM when the price drops. Usually at some point the price is low enough that it is cheap to max it out.<p>With my work Mac Pro I waited too long. I upped the RAM in that and the home Mac Pro at the same time, and it turned out taking the home one from something like 12 GB to 32 GB cost considerably less than taking the work one from around 8 GB to 18 GB!<p>[1] <a href=""https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/PCIe/OWC/Mercury_Accelsior/RAID"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/PCIe/OWC/Mercury_Accelsi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/PCIe/OWC/Mercury-Accelsior/S-Carrier"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/PCIe/OWC/Mercury-Accelsi...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Sonnet%20Technologies/USB34PME/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Sonnet%20Technologies/USB34PM...</a><p>[4] ...maybe.

- We have noticed a major shift to apps with Material design, arrogant Apple marketing aside, there&#x27;s alot of users on Android that DO care about design, UX and those tend to have rather newish phones.<p>Depending on your app you should of course also care for people on worse phones. If you&#x27;re providing a public service app (e.g. showing public transport schedules), you should probably target as low as 2.3 (even though, perhaps actually building 2 APKs for that usecase makes sense). If you&#x27;re building a modern 3D game, you should probably target API 19+ since users with older devices probably won&#x27;t be able to run it anyway.

Don&#x27;t throw the babies out with the bathwater, you know.<p>The point he tries to make with &quot;If it&#x27;s a core business function -- do it yourself, no matter what,&quot; is undercut by his over-generalization in &quot;If you&#x27;re a software company, writing excellent code is how you&#x27;re going to succeed.&quot;. If you are a software company and you&#x27;ve scoped &quot;write all the software&quot; as your job then you&#x27;re likely to hit a brick wall when it comes to delivery. Your value as a software company isn&#x27;t in how well you&#x27;ve rewritten the parts of code (like say a C compiler) that you can buy off the shelf, but in getting your final product out the door. From that perspective it truly doesn&#x27;t matter how much or how little your product consists of your own code versus third party code so much as the product delivers the functionality you intend it have and adds value in meaningful areas.<p>While the example above of puzzle-piecing a product out of a bunch of well known smaller components isn&#x27;t <i>glamorous</i>, it gets the job done and hopefully pays the bills. Presumably if done right it gets the job done faster and more productively than your competitors that are reinventing everything themselves... Also, in the industrial world outside of software, optimizing the pieces of the puzzle is entire sets of sub-industries (such as Supply Chain Logistics) and again while that&#x27;s certainly not exciting work, it can be profitable and the market is paying for those skills.<p>Finally, I think it says a lot that the best example Joel could think to use was an out-of-date example from a version of Excel that no longer exists built by a team that also no longer exists. I don&#x27;t doubt that there is code continuity from that era, but the days of Excel being a walled garden from the rest of Office, much less the rest of Microsoft, are past... I know there are critics of the push towards a &quot;One Microsoft&quot; culture and elimination of some of Microsoft&#x27;s worsts NIH tendencies at the cultural level, but this consumer is a fan and watching what Microsoft is doing in Open Source these days is fascinating and wonderful. I absolutely think this example Spolsky cites is dumb. If Excel&#x27;s 80s C compiler was so great they should have handed it off to the Developer Division to augment or better the C compiler they were selling as a product! In this case that actually was a core competency of the company and inter-team feudalism and NIH was decreasing the overall efficiency of the company and potentially keeping useful, profitable, and marketable enhancements from the profit center that could most benefit.

Then the faster merge-sort will be introduced as an obvious improvement to O(n log n) time, followed by quicksort with O(n log n) time <i>and</i> O(n) space...and at this point you may reasonably ask, &quot;So what?&quot;<p>The thing is is that merge-sort was discovered by John von Neumann [1] and QuickSort by CAR Hoare [2]. The less accomplished of the two won a Turing Award and one might quite legitimately walk away with the belief that developing algorithms from scratch may be non-trivial simply because the subject is really hard.<p>Which is a round about way of coming to some advice: if the very subject of algorithms isn&#x27;t enough to scare you off, don&#x27;t fret the fact that the presentation looks difficult. The apparent difficulty is in the subject itself and the only thing a gentle introduction or simplification means is that someone is pretending that the subject of algorithms is not really really hard with the natural consequence that when it does get hard, you&#x27;re more likely to see the struggle as a failing of the student rather as inherent in the subject matter.

The fact that there are government subsidies (or surcharges) involved is not relevant for that calculation.<p>The Google site is extremely thorough -- for the case where the consumer is buying the panels, they calculate the time to break even, but also a net present value given a 4% cost of capital. Same thing for the lease cases -- for an example I ran, the lease would cost $96 per month (fixed for the 20-year life of the lease), and offset $115 of a monthly $120 electrical bill at today&#x27;s rates. So, it would generate cash savings for me from day one. Most solar leases in fact GUARANTEE that you will pay less for electricity after the install. So, &quot;savings&quot; should not be in quotes, it&#x27;s a real savings for the lessee.<p>As for your argument that we might all be better off if we didn&#x27;t have to pay higher taxes for the subsidy -- maybe, but my decision to install solar or not is going to have a negligible impact on my personal tax rate, so I should value any savings against a fixed tax rate that doesn&#x27;t change as a function of my decision.",1439842735

Technically speaking, the hardware is rock-solid. There are no single points of failure in mainframe systems. But there are still some obscurities with the platform. There&#x27;s a lot of packages you&#x27;d expect to be available in your s390x distribution of RedHat or SUSE that missing. And that&#x27;s probably because the average open-source developer/maintainer doesn&#x27;t have the means to develop/test on a mainframe.<p>IBM needs to realize they have an open operating system on a closed platform and the two don&#x27;t mix. They are taking steps in the right direction, but time will tell if they get there. And they have to prove they can compete with the x86 guys on price.<p>> My limited understanding is that most mainframe customers are locked-in, e.g. they have legacy COBOL code running their ledger system and the expense to switch off of it is simply prohibitive. That plus the fact that the system is reliable, low-maintenance, etc. preserves the status quo, despite the fact that if you were to write the same applications today, you&#x27;d choose a newer platform because it would be more cost-effective.<p>You are mostly on track there. Mainframes haven&#x27;t died because of many of the reasons you listed above. But I&#x27;d have to disagree with last statement about choosing a &quot;newer&quot; platform. Mainframe hardware is modern hardware, in the sense they are updated every one to two years. Mainframe operating systems are modern operating systems. They also get updated every one to two years. If you look at every industry that has been around for more than 30 years, almost all of their mission critical workloads are done on System z. Cheaper isn&#x27;t cheaper when you have downtime.<p>But for some workloads, you are right: companies are only on mainframes because migrating to a different platform would be too costly.

Re &quot;how it falls out of the definition of NP&quot;, I think that was largely a failure on my part to understand exactly what you were asking about.<p>The parts that are &quot;by definition&quot; are:<p>* the set of programs involving steps like &quot;guess magically&quot; correspond to the ones that can be implemented with at most polynomial slowdown by a non-deterministic Turing machine (this is hand-wavy, but then again we&#x27;re talking about pseudocode; it&#x27;s possible to state it more precisely)<p>* if such an algorithm runs in polynomial time, then it&#x27;s in NP (by the definition of NP)<p>* ...so it can be reduced to an instance of any NP-complete problem (by the definition of NP-complete)<p>* ...and if P=NP then there exists a deterministic, polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem<p>The parts that require actual proofs are:<p>* the fact that the &quot;well-known&quot; examples of NP-complete problems like 3-SAT, TSP, and so on actually correspond to the formal definition of NP. These proofs ultimately reduce to the Cook-Levin theorem, or something similar in spirit.<p>* the fact that if <i>any</i> problem in NP has a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm, then there is <i>one</i> algorithm that can solve <i>all</i> NP problems in polynomial time. This relies on the existence of universal Turing machines that have at most a polynomial slowdown.<p>It&#x27;s likely there are other details that I&#x27;m forgetting, but that&#x27;s the gist of the argument.",1439841780

for believing this, and the strong attempts at defensiveness when its being considered that the majority response doesnt work.<p>NP defeatists can not stand the feeling they percieve of being condescended to when their choice to abandon a problem they failed to advance on or make a faster algorithm on, is unmasked from beneath the cloak of being &quot;impossible&quot; they covered it with, owing to their religion that P can not be NP.<p>instead of owning their choice to give up, they disguised the problem as impossible. when that disguise is revealed, they face their choice and face the possibility their failure was not excused by its being impossible, and their belief in intellectual superiority is challenged, and they percieve it as condescension.<p>the core contradiction is that the origin of the insecurity they are protecting against is their own choice to surrender, yet they try to blame it
on the revealing of that choice
by pretending its condescension. so they want to fight the voice that says the problem can be worked on ( and pretend its making them insecure ), to preserve their own narrative that it can&#x27;t, instead of fighting their self defeatest narrative which gave them cause for the insecurity in the first place.<p>its a common misattribution of responsibility to preserve a protective delusion:<p>&quot;it is not my fault i didnt solve
this, the problem is impossible&quot;<p>&quot;it&#x27;s not the fault of my choice to give up that I feel insecure, it&#x27;s their fault for unmasking that my giving up was a choice.&quot;<p>misattribution of responsibility
is a common maladaptive ( non workable ) response substitute instead of choosing to try another approach and create some results.<p>it so important to think about the culture of defeat around this because the stakes of these opportunities are so high: efficient acheduling, and dispatching, and gene sequence matching.<p>and the culture of defeat is essentially inefficiently systmeically and structurally draining resources from working on this. its of a significance that the psychology of this becomes important.<p>science works when it embraces questioning, including self questioning, of its methods, including its structural, systemic and cultural methods.<p>these are after all the operations or support and infrastructure faculties which support the work of science.<p>the culture of defeat and fake excuse around P and NP, lets people off the hook, as an excuse to shutter advances on whole classes of problems, and excuses a lack of results in making more efficient algorithms to meet those opportunities.<p>it becomes indoctrinated, a dogma, that P can not be NP,  and the true believers as we have seen are all the more fervent to compensate for the absence of proof of impossibility.<p>and this slows progress, which doesnt work.",1439841779

See: Ivy league, whatever else fits that bill. You don&#x27;t necessarily need a strong education to soar (though in my opinion it really helps), you need nepotism.<p>If you actually want kids to learn things, you need a triage system which queries the optimal engagement and learning conditions for each individual student to learn. Next, use the engagement conditions to prime the student (get them excited to learn)for the material. Then, implement those optimal learning and engagement conditions in a curricula that is 50% more complex than what you think the student can handle. Adjust as needed.<p>The hardest part is getting the students to be engaged/curious and setting them up with the resources and context to be an autodidact once class ends. Most graduates don&#x27;t have these things before or after college, and an arbitrarily elite school isn&#x27;t going to help them in and of itself. The pretension of being elite does a lot of harm to students.",1439841739

There will always be people in countries with lower costs of living that can offer to do a job remotely for cheaper. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fair necessarily to exclude them and keep pricing higher artificially just for our (developers) benefit. This is supply and demand on a global scale. Fortunately, I found that overseas developers who offer to do those jobs for pennies also often deliver subpar quality and have poor communication skills. That&#x27;s where I can stand out and capitalize on that competitive advantage. Clients that want to pay ridiculously low amounts for huge, complex tasks are clients I don&#x27;t want to work with anyways. They tend to be a giant pain in the ass. The overseas developers can gladly take them. Clients that know the value of my more expensive rates are the ones that tend to be easier to work with and have less unreasonable expectations.

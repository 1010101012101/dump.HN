Your nearest definition of consciousness &quot;emergent properties of lower level functions&quot; or something along those lines doesn&#x27;t really cut it, either. To say that something is an emergent property of another thing, without showing the steps of that emergence is kind of like defining red as &quot;an emergent property of the sun and a sheet of cellophane&quot;. It&#x27;s HOW it emerges that&#x27;s the hard question.<p>2. If you were pleased to hear another person&#x27;s discovery that &quot;my experience of experiencing is irrefutable&quot;, you might like to read Descartes&#x27;s account from over 400 years ago in his Discourse on Method.<p>He veered off into some strange and tenuous territory, but the opening of that book is excellent and it uses that discovery (a.k.a. the Cogito - I think, therefore I am) as the first axiom from which to build a whole philosophical system, and it&#x27;s a really interesting read.<p>This is the guy who invented algebraic geometry, from which we get the Cartesian plane, and the idea of ordered pairs, which is such a fundamentally useful idea that it&#x27;s hard to see just how brilliant a discovery it was. He had some things to say about consciousness that have not yet been improved upon.<p><i>EDITED</i> to say that the book I was talking about was Descartes&#x27;s Meditations on First Philosophy, for anyone interested. He decides, &quot;let&#x27;s doubt that anything at all exists, just doubt everything - where does that take us?&quot;",1414634376

8530944,comment,8528460,8530910,0,0,jvehent,,,"MIG author here. First, congrats to Mike Arpaia for shipping! That must have been a busy couple of months :)<p>There is a number of conceptual differences between MIG, GRR and OSquery. MIG does not retrieve data from endpoints, but instead focuses on answering yes/no questions.<p>For example: find hosts that have a file in /var/www that contains the regex &#x27;12345&#x27;. MIG will run the search on all endpoints and return the location of files and hosts that match. But it won&#x27;t return the files themselves. Privacy is preserved, but investigators need to manually retrieve files if needed. MIG takes this approach to keep the search very fast (parallel AMQP runs in seconds across thousands of endpoints). Retrieving data at large scale is too expensive for Mozilla (bandwidth, storage, execution time), and we like to protect privacy.<p>I really like the SQL approach taken by osquery. I brainstormed something similar last year [1] but did not get around to it yet. SQL is very natural to use for a lot of IT/Security people, and it&#x27;s great to be able to transfer that knowledge to search tools.<p>GRR and OSquery are awesome tools. And I can tell their authors are solving some really hard problems. We&#x27;re competing a bit, but it&#x27;s OK to have multiple tools with varying goals. And it&#x27;s great for borrowing each other&#x27;s good ideas ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://4u.1nw.eu/Presentation_workweek_20130916.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://4u.1nw.eu/Presentation_workweek_20130916.pdf</a> slides 10 & 11",1414633901

8530925,comment,8530221,8530221,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"> Why we should live in such a universe is a good question, but I don’t see how that can be answered now.<p>His last point here is salient.  Much like the various interpretations of quantum mechanics, any theories of consciousness are untestable.  But my problem with &quot;consciousness&quot; is that it&#x27;s not even a well-defined concept.  Suppose I replace all occurrences of &quot;consciousness&quot; in that article with the word &quot;qualgma&quot;.  It makes just as much sense.<p>Gravity, electrons, and energy are all concepts that are <i>defined</i> to exist as the manifestation of certain physical phenomena that can be modeled and predicted with mathematical equations.  These words are just English simplifications of the equations.<p>But consciousness has no such analogue.  It&#x27;s just a term that people throw around when they talk about the brain.  I believe that over time, it has started to acquire a more well-defined meaning -- something along the lines of &quot;the emergent properties of the brain&#x27;s activity resulting from lower-level processes&quot;.  This is similar to how a human body is just the emergent result of many atomic interactions.  This version of consciousness can be modeled, theorized about, and tested experimentally.  There&#x27;s nothing magical about.  As the brain&#x27;s neural circuitry becomes better understood, you could say consciousness is a simplified model that still has good predictive capability.<p>However, I would also like to focus on a much more interesting topic in the article:<p>> My consciousness is an undeniable fact. One can only infer facts about the universe, such as physics, indirectly, but the one thing I’m utterly certain of is that I’m conscious.<p>I believe Koch is conflating two distinct concepts.  If we take the definition of consciousness as the predictive modeling of the brain, then this is  something <i>totally</i> different than what he&#x27;s talking about here.  Let me alter his quote:<p>> That I <i>experience my existence</i> is an undeniable fact. One can only infer facts about the universe, such as physics, indirectly, but the one thing I’m utterly certain of is that I <i>am experiencing existence</i>.<p>It&#x27;s really astonishing to me that he words it this way, because independently I have thought almost exactly the same thing for a long time.<p>I&#x27;ve often struggled to put this notion into words, but let me try it in a new way with an analogy.  Suppose you see an apple floating in front of you.  You tell other people &quot;Look at this apple!&quot;  But they just go &quot;What apple?&quot;  So, you try to get crafty.  You take a picture of the apple with a digital camera.  But when you show people the photo on the computer, they still see no apple.  So you zoom in on the pixels and start copying the RGB values for each one by hand onto paper.  &quot;Look, this value is 237!&quot; you say.  And you sit down with a friend, and start calling each and every pixel&#x27;s values out as he puts them in manually into his image editing program.  When he&#x27;s does, you say &quot;Ha!  Look, there&#x27;s my apple, right on your screen!  And you put it in there yourself!&quot;  But he stares at you quizzically, and says, &quot;I still see no apple; just an empty table.&quot;  And no matter what kind of tricky experimental method you try to come up with to get everyone else to understand the concept of this apple that&#x27;s always floating in front of you, every attempt to catch it produces a representation of the apple for you and nothing for everyone else.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating because the people you tell about the apple say &quot;Well, you have provided no testable predictions, and no data that can be independently  verified by everyone else in society.  Clearly your apple doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot;  But it does!  You know it does!  In fact, out of everything that constitutes reality, the floating apple is the one thing you&#x27;re <i>most</i> sure of.  Frustrated, you walk around thinking you&#x27;re crazy until one day someone says, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t see an apple floating in front of you, but do you see the orange floating in front of me?&quot;  Which, of course, you don&#x27;t.<p>Now replace &quot;apple&quot; with &quot;the fact that I am experiencing my own existence&quot;.  It&#x27;s an element of reality that is only apparent to you on a personal level, and since it isn&#x27;t testable by other people, it is <i>not</i> a part of their reality, and thus does not exist as far as they are concerned.  And thus it&#x27;s not science.  Yet even though it&#x27;s not science, it is the one thing in life I am most certain of.  My five senses could all be faked with advanced enough neural circuitry.  I could be in an entirely simulated environment, with entirely simulated physics.  So when I order things in probability of how likely they are to be an illusion, <i>experiencing existing</i> falls at the lowest probability.  In fact, you could strip me of all my senses and put my brain in a vat, and as long as it&#x27;s running, I&#x27;m still experiencing existence.<p>If the idea bothers you that things might exist that are incapable of being verified consensually by society, look at this image of all the particle interactions (so far discovered): <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Elementary_particle_interactions.svg/2000px-Elementary_particle_interactions.svg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Ele...</a><p>If you&#x27;ll notice, gluons &quot;hang on&quot; to the rest of the particles by merely one interaction.  If this interaction was not present, as far as positivists are concerned, then gluons don&#x27;t exist.  But that seems entirely unreasonable to me.  I could imagine plenty of particles that could &quot;exist&quot; that simply don&#x27;t have an interaction with the ones in the standard model that constitute our reality.<p>Anyway, this is probably the most bizarre post I&#x27;ve ever written on HN, but hopefully what I&#x27;m trying to convey &quot;clicks&quot; for some people.",1414633285

I&#x27;m the Andrew who runs the Churn Buster product mentioned by patio11.<p>Very clever of you to think to email customers before their credit card expires. :-) We had the same idea and it was a feature in the original release of our product, but after several months we actually found that only about 30% of cards set to expire actually started failing payments within two months of hitting the expiration date, and after two months failure rates just return to normal. So, even with a healthy 50% conversion rate on the email campaign, we were only retaining about 1.5 customers per 10 that we sent 3 emails to. Furthermore, the email notifications to the customers who very likely didn&#x27;t need to receive the email were triggering cancelations from some customers as they re-evaluated their purchasing decision in front of a &quot;you owe us money!&quot; email instead of a sales page promoting the benefits they&#x27;re receiving. :-) For that reason, we no longer send out these emails by default. There are still some businesses where this makes sense, but they&#x27;re definitely the rare exception and not the rule.<p>Furthermore, we found that a very decent chunk of failed payments (maybe 15-30%?) will sort themselves out automatically with no intervention if you just try them a few times over a few days. Again, no need to email these customers and waste their time unless there is a time sensitive delivery that needs to go out or something similar.<p>So, for those two reasons we choose to wait until the third failed payment attempt before we start emailing the customer. But once we hit that third failed payment attempt, we really go to town trying to get in touch with the customer and get them current. We&#x27;ve got all sorts or tricks up our sleeves for this, including a real person with a great British accent who will call customers on the phone.<p>Happy to answer any questions you or anyone else may have about solving this problem. It really isn&#x27;t something many subscription service providers think about when they&#x27;re building their business. Feel free to reach out any time at andrew@churnbuster.io .",1414631877

What about ciphers, where small changes to a single bit in key, ciphertext or plaintext radically alters the evolution of the internals and output of the system?<p>But even that might be too strong a statement. Aren&#x27;t minimally interacting systems such as Conway&#x27;s Game of Life Turing Complete? There are tiny, tiny Universal Turing Machines, and UTMs are essentially free to encode/decode their tape inputs in any way they see fit.<p>Ultimately while IIT has a &#x27;mathematical description&#x27; it mostly only serves to obfuscate a naive and trivial notion that &#x27;the system has to be complicated and has to integrate and process local information in some holistic global way&#x27;.<p>No shit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1799"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1799</a>",1414631504

(That doesn&#x27;t include companies in other rope disciplines that are different from rope access, like tree climbing and entertainment rigging. Those are different trades. RA takes most of its methods from caving, and some from rock climbing.) If you want to learn to do it right and have a good experience on the job, &quot;go legit.&quot; But that means you&#x27;ll have to get certified. Unless you have specific, in-demand skills (electrician, fiberglass technician, weld inspector), few companies will pay for your first course - you&#x27;ll just have to pony up $1000+ on your own. However, once you get a job, they&#x27;ll pay for your re-certifications, as well as follow-up courses that you take as you get more experience and climb up through the certification ranks.",1414631476

I get confused and frustrated when I see an article like &quot;Simplify your web apps with JQuery&quot; and there&#x27;s no date of publication.  Was it the first edition of JQuery circa 2005, or was it a recent version?  At least when talking about a rapidly evolving software ecology, I think the date of publication is a critical piece of information to provide up front.<p>If an author fears the &quot;bit rot&quot; effect, then why not update the piece and provide an &quot;updated&quot; date, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Solving World Hunger with JQuery&quot;\n  by Blister Peanuts, October, 2010\n  Updated May, 2014\n</code></pre>\nThat magic &quot;2014&quot; cues the reader that there may be very recent, relevant information, and they are less likely to skip past it.",1400515192

There&#x27;s nothing wrong with wanting complete control of how my computer is being used.</i><p>Who cares if it&#x27;s _your_ computer? It&#x27;s _their_ product or service you&#x27;re using, which is offered to you under well-defined terms of use. You&#x27;re free to not use it if you don&#x27;t agree with the terms of use.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that breaking the terms of use <i>is</i> illegal or immoral. Then how does doing it on _your_ computer absolve you of responsibility? A person&#x27;s basement is also _his_ private space. Should he have free reign to hold people there against their will? Having a private space doesn&#x27;t give you carte blanche, especially when other people are involved (e.g. the people who built the products or services you&#x27;re using).<p>> <i>If the business model of the advertisers requires that they trust that my computer displays their ads then I see it as their fault for misplacing their trust.</i><p>The essence of your argument is that whenever you can screw somebody over and they&#x27;re powerless to stop you, it&#x27;s their fault when you screw them over. This is not an argument I&#x27;d be proud to make.<p>By this logic, a local convenience store that hasn&#x27;t installed security cameras is at fault when you steal from them, because they misplaced their trust in their customers. A woman walking alone at night is at fault when someone attacks her, because she misplaced her trust in society.<p>By the way, I use AdBlock.

How does its search work?<p>I agree that geocoding has been a problem for OSM, especially for building numbers, where the data often isn&#x27;t there.

People tend to add data to OSM when they&#x27;re confident that it&#x27;s actually being used, to its full extent. If there are a hundred buildings along a road, in theory you don&#x27;t need to add many of them before you can get a very good idea of where an address might be.",1400515011

This may turn out to be the most significant form of social engineering that we ever embark on, and it might not necessarily be a bad thing. Though his point is that it&#x27;s a discussion that we have to have before we enable those rights to the corporate-sphere.<p>&quot;With IPv6, the explosion of the Internet of Things, and all the data generating apps that are there for smart phones, and coming for smart cars, smart refrigerators, etc, each and every person (and object) will begin to be surrounded by a datasphere of archived data. That datasphere will be mined by what I call the &quot;The Invasion of the Data Snatchers&quot;. This is beyond government surveillance, and the rules and regulations about (a) privacy of one&#x27;s datasphere, and (b) the terms of access (much given away via the &quot;I accept&quot; button on apps) are not in place. We are not even sure how they should be fashioned, and who (at what level) should administer them. The most problematic area here is service providers who have to assess risk (car, health, house insurance). We are already seeing denial of service to individuals, based on access to one&#x27;s personal datasphere (e.g. cardio wrist band data resulting in denial of travel insurance). What happens when health insurance engages in health surveillance via one&#x27;s networked refrigerator, and car insurance via one&#x27;s vehicle? &quot;<p>Relevant part of the interview here:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6vacuBHYVE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6vacuBHYVE</a>",1400513977

Obviously, the value to the few having the information is increased because they can use the information to their advantage - but the overall value of something has to consider externalities as well, which in this case would mean considering at least the losses that unsuspecting trading partners incur, which already would make it a zero-sum game, so there at least is no positive value in keeping the information secret. Now, another externality of keeping insider information secret is that it leads to the market making less rational decisions about asset allocation, for example allocating capital to a company that is actually less efficient at doing its job in society than its competitor that publishes such information immediately and honestly, thus likely wasting resources in comparison to the allocation that would happen in an honest market.

I&#x27;ve worked at the large companies where we were stuck with Python 2.5 because of LTS versions of distros in production (around 2010).<p>I work at Continuum using our Python distribution (Anaconda[1] and Miniconda[2]).  We sell it as the Data Scientist&#x27;s answer to python, but as a sysadmin, I really think it is the answer administrators have been looking for.  It installs into one directory that can be blown away if needed.  It provides virtualenv-like environments except it you can isolate different versions of python or any binary.  You can &quot;activate&quot; your environment, just by setting your PATH to find the env&#x27;s bin first.<p>The conda package manager installs binary packages, so you don&#x27;t need to compile c-extensions on each machine.  Conda allows you to build all of your packages for each arch.  Binstar is our alpha package hosting service that lets you host packages and it has a multi-platform build service (super-alpha).  And you aren&#x27;t limited to Binstar if you want to host your own repos -- the commands are built into conda.<p>If you want to distribute non-python binaries, you can do that as well.

7767895,comment,7752547,7753044,1,0,Goladus,,,"I could take you around Boston and identify a number of scenarios where a bicycle following different rules makes things more dangerous.  Here&#x27;s one:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/JRQCRG9.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/JRQCRG9.png</a><p>The Saint Mary&#x27;s and Mountfort street intersection in Boston.  There&#x27;s a very long red light for cars traveling east.  A portion of the light is for traffic coming out of St. Mary&#x27;s street (which is usually only a single car or two), the rest is for pedestrians (primarily BU students), who tend to move efficiently and are easy to see and avoid if you are on a bike.<p>While the light is red, the entire area marked in green almost always empty (safe).  The smartest, safest move for a bicycle is to approach the red light and slow down, making sure there are no cars coming from the north or south, then proceed through the intersection (slowly, avoiding pedestrians), through the green area and onto park drive by themselves, without having to compete with the cars that will be merging (and while oncoming traffic is also conveniently stopped).<p><i>What&#x27;s the point of signage if you create a broad exemption from following them?</i><p>A broad exemption should coincide with a recognition that the rules and signage are inadequate and need to be updated where possible.  For example there&#x27;s a one-way street a short way from the picture I posted (Essex St, Brookline) which was recently amended to say &quot;One-way (except bikes).&quot;  That is, the signs and laws were adjusted to accommodate the unique characteristics of bicycles.<p>There are a lot of one-way streets that can easily accommodate bicycles.  Meanwhile there are some one-way streets that really should not be taken in the wrong direction by either bikes or cars.  But until the signage adequately distinguishes between the two, bikes are just going to ignore signs if they can get away with it.  (And it does happen-- I forget which street but there&#x27;s a street near Harvard Square that is clearly marked &quot;NO BIKES THIS DIRECTION, USE <street> INSTEAD&quot;",1400513347

Best you accept this fact now and learn at least the modicum necessary to defend yourself, because taking the stance that your principles place you above it all will only make you a target. Moreover, equating participation in office politics with Machiavellian bastardry is at best enormously naïve; sufficient acumen, which is well within the capabilities of almost any skillful programmer, will enable you to play a positive-sum game.<p>The long version:<p>In some organizations, it&#x27;s unnecessary to know anything about office politics, because they don&#x27;t exist -- a rare and happy state which obtained for the first decade of my career, and was fine as far as it went, but which left me utterly unprepared to deal competently with them once my desire to advance my career and my craft made it necessary for me to do so.<p>In some other organizations, or so I assume, it&#x27;s unnecessary to know much about office politics because, while they exist, it&#x27;s possible to avoid participation. I can&#x27;t speak to such situations from personal experience, but presumably they call for at least some modicum of knowledge on the subject, in order adroitly to avoid having any stance on a political matter -- at the very least, you&#x27;d need to be able to identify such matters, in order to avoid letting sheer ignorance betray you into taking a stance.<p>In most organizations, as far as I can tell, it is absolutely necessary to know something about how to play the game, because you&#x27;re required to sit down at the table simply by virtue of being part of the organization at all. In such a situation, there are absolutely no advantages to the belief that your principles require you to remain above it all.<p>On the one hand, the attitude that political acumen is unworthy of you will lead you into ignorance which will eventually betray you in the fashion I describe above. On the other, it&#x27;ll be more or less impossible to preserve indefinitely the belief among your fellows that you&#x27;re simply innocent of it all, which is the best you can hope for; eventually, people will realize that you regard the whole matter with contempt, which they will take personally, whether you so intend it or otherwise.<p>This being the case, once your true opinion of the matter becomes apparent to your fellows, your days in the organization are numbered, because however they&#x27;d otherwise be inclined to regard you, you have just given <i>everyone</i> a reason to regard you as a political enemy, and rightly so -- after all, no one loves being held in contempt, nor should he.<p>Having thus disposed of the question of the value, or lack thereof, inhering in the principled stance above politics, all that remains to consider is one&#x27;s degree of competence in that realm, and the only sensible opinion here is that one should develop as much competence as her natural talent makes possible. Just as with any other skill critical to one&#x27;s successful pursuit of her career goals, it makes no sense to aim for any lesser degree of attainment.<p>Given my own experiences at the hands of office politicians, I can certainly empathize with your apparent distaste for that entire realm of human endeavor. On the other hand, those same experiences lead me to regard the principled stance above politics as arrant foolishness, because if you&#x27;re in an environment where such politics exist at all, your alternatives are but two: you may retain your principled stance and rely upon good fortune, which will eventually exhaust itself and more probably sooner than later, to save you harming yourself through careless ignorance; or you may study the subject, at least to the extent necessary to arm you in self-defense, and ideally to the rather greater extent which will allow you to play the game as necessary, to the benefit of both the organization and yourself.<p>After all, just because the game of office politics is so often played in unprincipled fashion, you need not also behave in a manner unequal with your own principles. You just need to be good enough at the game to get away with it, and that&#x27;s another matter entirely. Whether Machiavelli&#x27;s opus is of value in such a pursuit, I cannot say, because it&#x27;s been many years since I read it, and I&#x27;ve never done so with an eye toward the direct personal utility of such advice. But if you&#x27;re going to be stuck playing the game, wouldn&#x27;t you agree that it&#x27;s better to do so well than poorly?<p>(<i>Update:</i> For an example of what I mean by &quot;playing the game well&quot;, see [1], where I describe how to avoid both the risk of coming off as an unmotivated time-server, and the risk that your colleagues will feel like you&#x27;re outdoing them and making them look bad.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7767987"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7767987</a>",1400512803

7767811,comment,7765758,7766004,4,0,eevilspock,,,"The vast majority has bought into the utter bullshit that advertising makes the web free. This delusion buries not only the fact that we have made a deal with the devil, but also that the deal really sucks. What we traded our souls for we don’t even get. The web would be both cheaper and better if we just paid for what we use straight up. And more importantly, society would be better. I&#x27;ll explain all of these.<p>IT&#x27;S NOT FREE<p>We’re not Facebook’s customers, advertisers are (more on this below). But we are the advertiser’s customers, and the cost of the &quot;free lunch&quot; is simply shifted to the price of the things we buy from them. In other words we still end up paying for <i>the full cost</i> of Facebook (and even more, as I&#x27;ll get to next). Costs may even shift regressively, to advertised products predominately consumed by those with lower incomes, in which case the poor are subsidizing the better off.<p>IT&#x27;S MORE EXPENSIVE...<p>Not only are you still paying for the full cost of the Facebook product you use, you are paying for all the advertising overhead: the costs of its advertising technology and infrastructure (huge, btw), the agency and creative costs (Don Draper and company have to pay for the hookers and scotch somehow, not to mention what’s-his-name who basically just lounges in his office barefoot thinking Japanese), and the advertiser&#x27;s big marketing departments (that often outnumber and outspend the people making the product!).<p><i>The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks.</i> – Jeff Hammerbacher, fmr. Manager of Facebook Data Team, founder of Cloudera<p>So in addition to the original product cost and the ad overhead costs, you are also paying the opportunity cost of an inferior product (as Dennis Curtis points out in the OP) as well as the engineering costs of figuring out how to optimize ad revenue, because that’s what happens when websites have to design to please advertisers over pleasing us, the users. Dalton Caldwell makes this point comparing Sourceforge to Github[1]. As ergo says in a comment[2], <i>“If the new news feed is making their advertisers happy (and bringing revenue into Facebook), then that&#x27;s what they optimize for.”</i> As jfoster says in a comment[3], <i>“Ad-supported models untie the relationship between UX and revenue.”</i><p>Furthermore, our identities and privacy are bought and sold to the highest bidders. And where do the bidders get their money? From us of course! A double whammy! We&#x27;re trading our privacy for free product? Bullshit. We get personalization? Bullshit. Personalization means optimizing something for me, not optimizing for the advertiser. Again, we&#x27;re not the real customer. We’re certainly not Google’s[4][5].<p>WAIT. IT&#x27;S EVEN WORSE...<p><i>Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need.</i> – Tyler Durden, Fight Club<p>Think of the social costs of advertising. The web is infested with misinformation and manipulation. Beside the lying ads themselves, relying on a revenue stream entirely dependent on how many ads are seen severely affects the moral choices of those who decide what gets produced and how its presented. What are the costs of a misinformed and variously manipulated citizenry, of distortions to the free-market?<p>Knowledge and discourse are the lifeblood of both democracy, free markets, progress. The web, from the little scammy websites to the big brand ones that so many blindly trust, has a huge influence on who we vote for, what we buy, and most importantly, what we believe.<p>There is no free lunch, and there is no free web. This &quot;free&quot; ad-&quot;supported&quot; web we have is much too expensive.<p>—<p>[1] <a href=""http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7484075"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7484075</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7484442"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7484442</a><p>[4] <i>Lloyd made his pitch, proposing a quantum version of Google’s search engine whereby users could make queries and receive results without Google knowing which questions were asked.

I looked on Google Play and found an app called &quot;OsmAnd Maps & Navigation&quot; that was well rated, it was also offline which was a plus as there is limited mobile coverage outside of the main parts of the island. I downloaded it then the dataset for Indonesia (200mb, it took a while), and tried finding a route. After a few minutes (!) it had calculated one, but the route definitely wasn&#x27;t optimal. I tried another app &quot;Sygic: GPS Navigation & Maps&quot;, it was premium but had a 7 day free trial (perfect for my 3 day road trip).

If you feel you could live off that amount and you have a programmer job, you should do it now while continuing to work at your job, invest the difference, and just retire in 8 years or so.",1400511636

Furthermore, the following is not even my opinion, just speculation.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that the article is a way to put female success in an apparently (if the list of best all-time performers is any indication) male-dominated &quot;field&quot; under the spotlight, which can be a way to motivate other female contestants or young girls to appropriate those types of competitions (or any other remotely related field).<p>I&#x27;m not even sure they do need that in the first place, but it&#x27;s always a process of chicken and egg where seeing someone you can more easily relate to succeed in some domain makes you more likely to realize that there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t have a stab at it yourself.<p>So I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense, but yeah, the female angle might be just a way to get the thing going.",1400511607

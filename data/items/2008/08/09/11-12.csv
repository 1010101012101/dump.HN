It's not more civil then a very relaxed in-person discussion. But when it's online, it seems extremely restrained.<p>I had almost written off online discussion if a forum over a certain size (such as comments on a blog). As an experiment, I think it's very impressive. Shows it can be done.",1218282926

271605,comment,270809,271545,0,0,netcan,,,"First/Early mover, is (I think) a more useful concept from the market perceptive then the technology perspective.<p>eBay  was the winner that emerged from the first tussle and as said above it was the first to hit a certain size. You might not want to call it a first mover but that is a semantic discussion. From the perspective of the market, it was.<p>The iphone certainly is a late entrant any way you slice the market. Late mover doesn't necessarily mean loser though.<p>Palm was a late entrant. I think what you get in that case is that the market had a few false starts. In that case, moving early would have been a mistake as the market didn't take off.<p>You could argue that the ipod was a first mover from a marketing perspective. The idea is that the product (in the minds of users) is so different that it is essentially a different market. grey area<p>But some areas definitely favour early movers. Interestingly, I don't think viaweb was one of them. You have a very large choice of online shop building software these days. There is not too much advantage in choosing the same software as everyone else. But I guess that wouldn't have been obvious at that point. \nThings could have rolled out differently though 'Web malls' could have happened. In that case, being in early would have been a big deal.<p>Cheers for the link. Is there analysis that goes with it?",1218281839

271601,comment,271560,271594,0,0,pius,,,"I agree.  Ideally, the API you end up exposing should be something that you're <i>already using</i> to build services on top of yours (plus or minus a few modifications).<p>Also, check out Joshua Bloch's excellent presentation on how to design a good API: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3733345136856180693"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3733345136856180693</a>.  One interesting point he makes is that you should avoid exposing a public API until you've successfully built three clients for it.",1218280853
271600,comment,271226,271226,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Here's a very important question: what do you bring to the table other than the idea?<p>This is important for many reasons. (1) You have to open up and tell some people about the idea if you expect to hire/attract someone to build it, and (2) what's to prevent them from taking the idea and building it without you? NDAs/Non-competes are one route but you might find a very difficult time getting good coders to sign them. So what makes you think that, if you told the idea to a technical person, they still need you around?",1218280548

As a programmer it's a valuable source and often I will read entire comment threads. That's rare nowadays as the signal to noise ratios are pretty bad at most sites.",1218280127

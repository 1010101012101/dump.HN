3508952,comment,3504981,3506385,2,0,roel_v,,,"For the record, it wasn't me who downvoted.<p>Re: the group effort of invention, I don't see the relevance. One can invent as 'work for hire' in the same way that workers in a pottery factory don't become owners of the pots. The second part, that Rearden Steel was an improvement of 'regular' steel, is not a valid comparison either. 'Steel' is a broad word for purified iron, the methods for doing so being diverse. Rearden Steel was (I'm not sure this was stated explicitly, but can imo be reasonably be derived from the circumstance that were described) a specific alloy, made with a specific production process. That is much more specific than 'steel', and here it turns into a discussion on how specific an invention needs to be for it to be able to be 'intellectual property'. I don't think we're at the stage yet where it makes sense to discuss that - my problem is with the crowd who wants to abolish IP all together, or at least have laws that make any enforcement of it impossible or make the cost/benefit tradeoff of enforcement greater than 1.<p>I now regret using 'natural rights' without qualifying it because I used it in a broad sense, not specifically in the Aristotelian or any other more 'defined' natural rights definition - just as catch-all term for 'axiomatic rights'. (at least for the purposed of my post - I myself still subscribe to an Objectivist foundation of 'natural rights'). Either way, I don't think it's material to the post; nonetheless I can't help myself but saying that I don't see why when a right was first recognized as a natural right reflects on it actually being a 'natural right'. Before the Enlightenment, there was little to no need for IP rights - it wasn't needed in canonical law because canonical law restricted <i>content</i> so the form of that never turned into an issue; and in common law there were marginally few situations where it was an issue.<p>Finally, Disney never took a verbatim copy of a work and sold it to cinemas; that's not a valid argument for not having IP rights at all. This line of reasoning is imo straw man reasoning. Yes, creators are influenced, in some cases more than others, by existing works or social contexts. That doesn't make the concept of IP invalid. It's merely an (obvious) observation that leads to the conclusion that there need to be boundaries to when something is 'intellectual property'. As I wrote in a post above, I don't care much for that discussion, as it's way beyond the fundamental issue here. I guess our positions aren't that far from each others'; no, IP rights aren't exactly the same as tangible property rights, but there are large amounts of overlap, especially in the philosophical justifications for it (e.g. large parts of Locke's theories on property can (and imo should) be applied to IP rights). Enforcement of IP rights is lacking, as evidenced by the large amounts of pirated content available online. Legal measures without due process may not be the right solution, but previous measures (e.g. the DMCA, which was vilified as much as SOPA back in the 90's! I guess there aren't that many people left who remember those 'discussions') have proven to be ineffective. Website operators shouldn't bear all the responsibility of enforcing IP rights, but they need to make a real effort, especially in cases where their business stands to profit from infringement (Megaupload, but potentially others, too).",1327481950

All of them, eventually. How poor exactly? Well, you could do worse than to look at Chinese factory workers for an indication of where things will end.<p>Of course it's more complicated than that: if the average man has become as poor as a Chinese factory worker, he will no longer be able to afford expensive gadgets and value added services, so it'll be in the interest of at least some sectors of the economy (think Apple and Google) to keep the impoverishment of the middle class down to a minimum. On the other hand there are other sectors of the economy (think McDonalds and Walmart) that will do just fine even if everyone is poor, so it'll be interesting to see how this plays out.<p>But, like I said, this article is ridiculous.

I'm stating my view of what's driving this theory.""<p>OK, fair enough, but I still think the analogy is a misrepresentation of what really drives people who have strong feelings against intellectual property rights enforcement. There are several camps who can't be lumped together, and whose 'theories' are largely in internal conflict: there are the copyright abolitionists, there is the GPL/FSF crowd, there is the entitled crowd who doesn't really care about reason and just repeatedly says that it's 'unfair' that their 'fair use rights' (of which they have a completely warped view, and which have never existed in the form they imagine in the first place) are being curtailed.<p>Either way, we disagree on enough other points to continue discussing ;) For example, 'website operators' aren't one group who all deserve indemnification under all circumstances. Megaupload, for example, is a clear case (for the reasonable, non-dogmatic observer) of 'intellectual property infringement facilitation for monetary gain'. Arguably Youtube used to be in its early days. Websites aren't 'press' by definition, and while it's not prima facie reasonable to expect them to be the first conservators of intellectual property laws, they can't just say 'oh it's our users, it's not our responsibility'.<p>Re: the edit, using that quote in that context makes me angry because it's such a fundamental misrepresentation of what Objectivism and Rand's philosophy stands for and was founded in. Having governments enforce property rights is not the same as what happened in the socialist tyranny that destroyed Rand's family and from which she escaped. Crikes, Rand herself made her fortune from writing screenplays and books, without copyright she would never have been in a position to produce abstract works like her work after The Fountainhead!",1327480542

Automation is becoming more and more advanced, particularly if you factor advances in robotics and ml since 2006 or so.<p>Things move faster and average just doesn't seem to cut it when you can manufacture excellence. Hell, lawyers and doctors will be next, how about faux ai that can write simple web apps or come up with good designs? Give generative models a few more years to advance, we'll see how far fetched that is.  Some people will get very rich from all that. But that wealth will go to those who control what amounts to the means of production and they'll be able to defend those means with patents. I guess workers could strike back in the day, good luck with that now, the little guy has even less negotiating power.<p>All this to say, I think these trends and the shift they bring are going to be the most fundamental shift in economic organization since the industrial revolution. Not sure what the answer is, but I'm concerned that those in power dont even recognize the issues (they're not ""nerds"", as they say.)

If you could express what you want, you could replace considerable part of Knuth's books by referring to ""just sort these numbers for me"", leaving the ""how"" to the computer.<p>Bridges don't get built because some guys ""wants to go see the other shore"". Bridges get built by rigorous design and constructed a rivet by rivet or bolt by bolt. Then you can go see the other shore.<p>For most part, we've come a long way in programming. Sorting has many reasonable algorithmic approaches well-studied and as a result of that in almost any language you can already say sort() and have some stuff sorted. I don't particularly need to know that Python uses timsort, it just sorts. Of course, I can study sorting in detail if I want to and possibly discover something novel.<p>Why programming never gets easy is that by solving existing problems we accumulate newer, more complex problems and interactions. <i>Programming will always be difficult</i> because we automate anything that's no longer difficult.<p>The ""Sort these"" example is not programming, it's something else that potentially builds on programming. Type some stuff into Matlab and watch your computer sort out difficult stuff for you and do the calculations in parallel in highly efficient manner using Cuda. It's not programming, it's using a machinery that has been programmed to interpret certain classes of the user's wishes and take care of all the physical steps required to finish the desired computation.

More people are being born into a world where fewer are required. That is quite a scary thought. Computers and machines automate and replace people everywhere.<p>I have some anecdotal evidence of this:<p>At my last business we used to follow-up twice via email with all of the people who had not responded to a quote that we had sent them. We had 50-100 enquiries a day so the follow-ups soon mounted up. I tried every CRM and mail-list manager out there. I could not find one that would trigger an email from my Gmail account if a contact had not responded. I was spending 3-4 hours a day doing the follow-ups. So were my staff. It got to the point where I wanted to hire someone to do it. Eventually I learnt more about the software and read up on ruby on rails. I hired a small software house to help with the backend, built the front-end myself and a month later, a machine replaced the humans and prevented a new hire. That is just one job at a tiny 5-person company. At scale, computer-based automation creates huge efficiencies.

Chuckle, or shrug<p>5. Two finger swipe back on my trackpad on lion<p>6. Scroll<p>7. Repeat 2 - 6<p>Now its<p>1. Go to Mongout\n2. Click right\n3.

Google is one of the few companies that can sustain internet businesses without a business model because anything that encourages more internet use indirectly helps Google.<p>In my opinion, Google is still a strong exit strategy for many years to come. Google has $7 B in cash, $29 B in assets and only $3 B in liabilities.<p>Of course I would never build a business with Google as an ""exit"" strategy, but I think that's the best option that Twitter has. Sure you can argue for the corporate spin, but I personally feel that is a weak play (like someone else said, there are a million other corporate collab startups out there already that can clone Twitter).<p>It makes even more sense since Evan Williams (founder of Odea, parent company of Twitter) sold his previous blogging company, Blogger, to Google.",1224115179

One showing the Mac’s unit share in the U.S. retail market at 18 percent, up from “a single digit number, just a few years ago”. Cook then drops the kicker, the single key point you need to grasp to understand Apple’s Macintosh business: “And what’s more impressive than this is if you look at revenue share. Because we focus on fully-features systems, and we don’t compromise on quality, our revenue share is over 31 percent. That means that one out of every three dollars that’s spent on computers in U.S. retail is spent on the Macintosh. What a difference a few years makes.”</i>",1224114134

Girls are naturally born with cooties, which is utterly intolerable.<p>As far as being discriminated against, I'm not quite sure how to answer that. My investors don't discriminate against me; I discriminate against my investors. They can't be gay or Jewish.",1256954101

I wrote most of our initial business plan in WriteRoom as well.  The biggest lesson:  formatting is a distraction.

913153,comment,912675,912675,0,0,crux,,,"Google Wave is not in beta. It's in public preview. Right now they're not interested in being useful to you or any other user; they're still building and designing the damn thing. The only reason they let you on is so they have a bunch of new user activity to process.<p>The very fact that people are complaining that it's disappointing means that Google is doing just fine. It might be disappointing to you, the eager early adopter, but it's not stupid on their part. The very fact that you want to have all your friends come use it (I do too) means that whenever Google <i>does</i> decide to open the tap, they will have all the users they want.<p>The network effect is crucial for getting a new communications tool off the ground. And as soon as Google wants to take advantage of the network effect, they'll give you and me some more invitations and I assure you, we won't have any problem finding folks to accept. In the meantime, we're still playing in Google's sandbox.<p>EDIT: Incidentally, as further evidence of the fact that Google is leveraging exactly as much of the network effect as they feel like leveraging: the thing it does where anybody in your GMail contacts is automatically added to your Google Wave contact list is fuckin' brilliant. It's a great way to encourage use, by making sure that as many people as I'm likely to be interested in using Wave with are directly accessible to be contacted, without my even having to say, 'So, did you get a Google Wave invite? Let me know when you're in and we'll chat!'",1256953903

There are many unethical things that are still legal (e.g. patent trolls, large companies burying competition through using the legal system as a money drain, suing someone for defamation/slander just to shut them up about something that is true but you don't want anyone to know about, etc).<p>And it wasn't 'above the board' either, because it's not like they <i>told</i> the restaurant what they were doing. If I call ahead and book a table for two that I have no intention of using unless I can scalp/pawn it off on someone else, how am I being ethical by lying to the restaurant? {/edit}",1256953667

Circulation figures are tremendously important to the media industry. They are a principal determinant of advertising rates and last week there were many reports on the quarterly circulation figures falling for the top five US newspapers.<p>Are there any publically-available services that provide this kind of industry-level data?

Which is why so many people took offense when I brought it up... in their conscious mind they're not gender biased, but when they think about it, perhaps my more ""feminine"" accomplishments wouldn't be as interesting to these male evaluators as more ""masculine"" accomplishments. It makes perfect logical sense, so I don't understand why I'm being attacked for bringing up the possibility of subconscious gender preferences.<p>In fact, your comment merely reinforces your gender bias, which I'm guessing many of your peers also hold.<p>""man up"" ? Are you saying a man wouldn't get upset about gender discrimination? A bunch of men got VERY upset from the mere mention of gender discrimination--tried to put me down for suggesting it and told me to quiet down about it.

That would be a value judgement (not to mention a glittering generality if applied to all geriatrics).<p>Well let's say ""usefulness"". What is the value of 60 years of experience? Depends on the experiences, and the context. A woodworker's skills don't age, so long as they're maintained by practice. Programming language (non-algorithmic) skills age exponentially faster. For really complex problems, like human ones, an understanding of the dimensions of life and its complexities is never big enough; thus long experience lends greater perspective.<p>I've found that whenever I think I know something about someone I don't know, that illusion goes away once I get to know them ... unless their 'life' has consisted of nothing but being 'useful'.",1256951866

Legal and illegal and right and wrong and not the same thing.  Being ethical doesn't just mean following the law, it means following the spirit of the law and not doing things other would perceive as wrong, regardless of the law.  It's wrong to cut in line, but it's not illegal, that doesn't mean you should do it.  It's wrong to be rude and insulting for no reason to a stranger, but it's not illegal, that doesn't mean you should do it or that it's OK to do it.",1256951487

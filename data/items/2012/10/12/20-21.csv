Or failing that would have to offer some prepackaged browser.<p>And every device, from a smartphone to a 30"" screen running on an octo-Xenon would have to be able to execute the same native code.<p>And each vendor of a browser kit would try to establish their own web standards to go with their home-grown engine.<p>I am pretty sure this is not the future of the web, and this seems like a great thing.<p>And it's not like this is a completely novel idea. None of the proprietary sandboxed browing environments of the past (Flash, Silverlight...) made anything really easier.

4646807,comment,4644614,4644614,18,0,mikeash,,,"It's important to note that it's extremely easy to ""beat"" comment spam if you have a relatively low-traffic site and some programming time to spend on a custom solution.<p>The per-message payoff for spam is horrendously low. Spammers only do it because they can post a huge number of messages. The big threats are necessarily automated, and that automation isn't going to bother with special cases for any site that isn't worth their while.<p>For the longest time, the anti-spam measure on my blog's comments was a field that literally said:<p><pre><code>    Type the word ""elbow"": _____\n</code></pre>\nAnd it only accepted the comment if you typed the word ""elbow"". It wasn't even a dynamic word. It was literally hardcoded to be the word ""elbow"". This stopped almost all spam for years.<p>Somebody finally added this to their bot, so I modified it slightly, to:<p><pre><code>    Type the word ""humour"", but with American spelling: _____\n</code></pre>\nOnce again, this stopped almost all spam for years.<p>A few months ago, more for fun and curiosity than because I really needed it, I replaced that anti-spam field with a JavaScript hashcash-based solution. Basically, when the user wants to make a comment, the page fetches a problem from the server whose solution is difficult to compute but easy to verify. The page then computes the solution on the commenter's computer, and posts it along with the comment. I tuned it to take about 20-30 seconds on modern hardware/browsers.<p>For the curious, the problem I chose is a standard one you'll find if you search for ""hashcash"". The quick version is that the server generates some random data and gives it to the client. The client then searches for a salt that, when added to the data, produces a SHA-1 hash with a given number of leading zero bits. The number of leading zero bits required can be easily tuned, with each additional bit roughly doubling the amount of time it takes to find a solution. The client's solution can easily and quickly be verified by just combining the client's solution with the generated data and counting the number of leading zeroes in the SHA-1 hash.<p>Now, this would not stand up to a concerted effort. My JavaScript implementation is pretty slow, which means that the 30-second work required by my page could be reduced to <1s of CPU time for a program optimized to break my protection. But it doesn't matter, because it's not worth anybody's time to do this.<p>I occasionally get spam, still. From looking at the logs, I'm about 99.9% sure that these spam comments are being posted by actual human beings sitting at a browser. I have no idea how it could possibly be cost effective to do this, but the quantity is low enough that it's not a real problem.<p>My crazy hashcash solution has an additional benefit, which some might see as a liability. I only start the work when the user clicks on the comment form, in order not to burn up their battery unnecessarily if they don't plan to leave a comment. The user then has to wait until the proof of work is completed, typically 20-30 seconds, before they can post a comment. This strongly discourages short, off-the-cuff comments, which are almost invariably worthless anyway.<p>In short: spam prevention is easy if your site is small and you have the time to invest in a custom solution. <i>Any</i> custom solution will do. As long as it doesn't match whatever patterns spambots possess, it doesn't much matter what you do, as long as it's unusual.<p>Once your site gets big enough, you'll no doubt need more. But cutesy stuff like changing your form variable names won't save you then anyway. If you're at the level where the linked solution works, you're at a level where nearly <i>anything</i> custom-made will work.",1350075297

I answered that while bubble sort is normally terrible, it's a great choice here if you're hand-rolling a sort instead of using a library.

4646694,comment,4644877,4644877,2,0,aguynamedrich,,,"Looks cool, but also looks just like it's aspiring to be Android Bootstrap which already exists.  I don't use either, because application setup isn't really the big pain point of Android development.  I'd love to see this effort being focused on something with more value, but I applaud the effort regardless.<p>Edit:<p>I judged too quickly, and this is really cool.  I did a quick setup from both Android Bootstrap and Android KickstartR.  Android KickstartR worked with very minimal effort, and while there were a few things I had to do manually in Eclipse because of some weirdness in the latest Android toolkit (set JDK compiler to 1.6 to fix attribute errors, rename the projects...the usual), it worked and it wasn't so think with someone else's coding and project setup style that I could easily get cranking on this.  When I set up from Android Bootstrap, it flat out didn't work with a simple Import from Eclipse and when I browsed through the source files, it looks really thick with boiler plate code.  Bootstrap looked more like an app in a box and less like an actual bootstrap or kick start for my own app.<p>This KickstartR thing can go a long way actually if it maintains the lightweight feel.  I don't like that AB uses Roboguice for that reason (as an example of what I mean about lightweight vs heavy-handed in this case).  The second you introduce that by default, as seems to be the case in AB, you're now tied to that whether you like it or not.  I personally gave Roboguice a try and just didn't think it added value for me and wasn't my style.  I have other ways of achieving the same benefits that fit my style better, so I'd rather not have it, or at least have the option to remove it.<p>Something cool for this KickstartR would be to support arbitrary libs and not just the really popular ones.  For example, I published my own lib which currently only I'm using AFAIK.  But regardless, I use this lib in all of my own work.  It would be nice to add a reference from that here, especially since I publish a jar with my library so it would be as easy as copying my jar into the libs directory.  A former coworker of mine did the same, and I'd love to grab his libs in the process as well (as well as things like http-request, etc).<p>Sorry about the quick judgment...nice work.",1350073676

I'm comparing current airliners with imaginary ones that are more efficient. The article claims that we've basically hit the physical limit for airliner efficiency, while I maintain that this is nonsense, and while we may have hit a limit for efficiency <i>while maintaining all of the other attributes we want</i>, we certainly haven't hit the limit of efficiency period.<p>For example, an airplane with a 40:1 L/D (done in the 70s, easy today) able to carry half its empty weight in payload (nothing too hard there) will require about 0.3kWh/mile per ton of payload to maintain level flight. Even accounting for propulsion inefficiencies, that's <i>way</i> more efficient than the 747.<p>Why don't we have such airplanes? Not because it's somehow physically impossible, nor even technologically impossible, but simply because it's not worth the tradeoffs. Nobody cares about increasing the efficiency of air travel if the result is an airplane that's ten times slower than a modern airliner.<p>Can we build a more efficient airliner? Of course! To say ""no"" is to imply that modern airliners are optimized for efficiency <i>above all other things</i>, which is pretty much ridiculous on its face. Can we build a more efficient airliner while still keeping all the <i>other</i> stuff we want out of airliners, like a mach 0.8 cruising speed and global range? Well, that's a bit harder.",1350073574

4646679,comment,4646509,4646509,5,0,TheEskimo,,,"Honestly, bubble sort isn't <i>that</i> bad.<p>Couple years ago I had a fairly simple program which collected some data into a linked list and displayed it at the end. It took about 2 seconds to load and process the data from disk. I realized it might be neat to optionally sort the output. Since I didn't feel like doing serious work, I just added a bubble sort to my linked list which took a comparison function and then bubble-sorted by pointer swapping.<p>Guess what time it added? less than a 10th of a second. Completely negligible. It saved me a few hours (as writing bubble sort for a linked list takes maybe 5 minutes and has no chance of complicated bugs) and I doubt anyone will ever notice any slowdown.<p>So what's the lesson? Little performance tweaks hardly matter in the average program nowadays because everything's disk or network bound (IO bound). For the average program it's not worth writing more complex code that will be quicker (once you fix the hard-to-see bugs) until you actually know the slowness is an issue.",1350073474

It's getting better in certain areas, but when you talk about ""technical"" positions e.g. programming, sysadmin, etc the ratio seems to be pretty bad and far less than what it could be.<p>Right now I suspect too many women that are kind of interested and may want to do this kind of work are scared off/intimidated (or worse, they never even consider it because of the thought ""I'm not that kind of person"") by the stereotypes/culture/etc and that's too bad.",1350072749

Now, ensure that each form instance cannot be submitted more than once AND that the delta between the current tick count and the form's tick count is greater than or equal to the amount of time that would be need for a human to fill out the form.<p>You MUST ensure client-side error detection is superb (as you want to catch all errors prior to submitting), handle for back button usage properly (browser caching directives, http status codes, etc), and ensure you handle for browsers which may auto fill information in for the user.<p>You would be surprised just how many bots come in and either used a cached form or immediately submit it.

It is that consciousness that I believe is paramount.<p>I believe first, we have to realize that people in general are not aware that they could be aware. What I mean by this is that at first, you have to realize that you can be better, or you can achieve better if you bring the rules, or guides, or signs, into your consciousness.  For example, without being aware that your daily activities could be an activity towards self-improvement, you cannot really avail the opportunities to be conscious.<p>Secondly, and once you realize the above, you can further raise your consciousness level for the betterment of not only yourself, but for the humanity at large (starting from your immediate close-by people in your circle).<p>So all in all, with the combination as you suggest, people can become more conscious, more ethical, more compassionate....all because they are making an effort to staying in here-now.",1350072574

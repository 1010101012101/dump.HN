However, my speed also varies greatly depending on what I'm reading. <i>The Art</i> can take me almost 10 minutes per page, while Harry Potter or some other fiction book clock in at 150-200 pages an hour.<p>Unlike you, I don't read aloud very fast. In fact, I'm usually pretty poor at reading aloud. At max speed, I read much, much faster than I could possibly speak and when reading aloud I often stumble over words because my mind is going on, but my mouth is still trying to say the third word behind.<p>To a certain extent I sometimes dislike reading very fast. My retention rate is the same either way but I will often finish good books too quickly for my liking. This may also be a reason why I am attracted to longer books -- they can provide more than an hour or so of reading time.",1257724751

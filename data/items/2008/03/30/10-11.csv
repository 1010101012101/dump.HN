150032,comment,149932,149932,0,0,uuilly,,,"C++ is like French.  There are lots of idiosychrasies.  Bad syntax leads to an inexplicable reaction (from the complier or Frenchman.)  For the first few years you'll sound like a buffoon.  But once you get the hang of it, it rolls off the tongue.  And once you master the slang, you can say things REALLY fast and very few will understand you.  I for one welcome this awkward new grammar and its unforgiving compiler errors.  Vive Le C++0x!",1206874437

150025,comment,149489,149732,0,0,Tichy,,,"OK now that I logged in I see it (very small and in grey). I guess since I have been frustrated so many times before (I have this problem EVER time I go on flickr), I didn't expect to find one anymore.<p>Usually I end up going to the FAQ and then somehow I figure out how to do it. I don't use flickr that often, so I keep forgetting.<p>I guess I would expect a big, fat button, since it seems rather important, but it might be different for different people.",1206872663

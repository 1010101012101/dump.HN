2849561,comment,2849388,2849388,24,0,roel_v,,,"The problem with this is the same problem that shows in actual karate kata in the context of its broader supposed relation to actual fighting: people get caught up in the minutiae of the exercise itself and forget its purpose, which is to win a fight (or, write a full-on application that does what users want it to do).<p>In karate, this has caused the dilution of most forms of karate (with the exception of Kyokushin) into little more than ritualized movements, where the vast majority of even high-level teachers don't know how it relates to a real fight. Pure theory has taken over - 'when your attacker does a simple forward kick ('teep', don't know what it's called in English), move the leg with your hand!'. Except that that never happens in the real world, and yet it's a core movement in many kata (and kihon etc, not just kata).<p>Now, how does that relate to software? Just knowing how to write a binary tree, or linked list, or singleton, or whatever, doesn't make one capable of writing a program that users want to use. Yes, maybe it makes one capable of writing a <i>perfect</i> program even, in the sense that it may even be mathematically proven correct; yet that's absolutely irrelevant outside of the realm of the theoretical. The basics of this nature are well-documented everywhere already, and it's not necessary to know all of them before doing more integrated exercises; full applications that people actually want to use.<p>Or to make the connection back to martial 'arts' (I hate that word, what's 'arty' about it? We need to get rid of the mystical aura around it - it's fighting, a methodology to inflict maximum, concentrated or controlled damage onto another person, sorry for tangent - it's a pet peeve ;) ); we need to get rid of the karate's, tae kwon do's and capoeira's of the software world (disclaimer: I have brown belts in judo and karate, I get to have an opinion on it ;) ) and we need to go back to the essence - the mixed martial arts of software development: the misv or startup or whatever you want to call it. Actual products for actual users, not fetishising technology for technology's sake.<p>(second disclaimer: I know I'm sort of arguing a straw man here, nobody said anything about not making end-user products, but it's a lot easier to make a point when you don't have to put in all the nuances ;) )",1312538272

Thank you.<p>The biggest point for me is your point about people with pseudonyms scaring away people that you actually care more for, close friends/family. I never thought of this point, but I do agree that my mum would be more hesitant to post if l33tGuy and WhooItsMe have a conversation with me.<p>Your point is, therefor, in my opinion great, but I still don't think that pseudonyms should be banned:<p>- You didn't comment on the inconsistency (LadyAda? Lady Gaga? Ok. darklajid? No) issue.<p>- You are masking the issue that there's no way to verify names anyway (so far. I hope it'll stay that way). So you're cheating yourself if you hope that this strategy leads to everyone using his real name<p>- I could take your argument further, to dangerous levels, by saying that a lot of people in my offline social network would probably be uncomfortable participating in discussions that are in English. Or with people that have obviously 'foreign' names, the more different the scarier (Asian countries come to mind, Israeli names could be good as well). My mum wouldn't comment if WhooItsMe comments on my picture, but she also wouldn't comment if Yuval would write something..<p>You cannot protect people from the world around them. You can try to find ways to cater for everyone, but in my world the solution to your scenario is:<p>- Allow people to choose their name<p>- Give people a great deal of (simple/intuitive) control about visibility and privacy. I'll help my mum set it up..<p>One last note: I'm 'darklajid' here, but I voluntarily give away my real name, as email address in my profile. That's the _right_ way around for me: I chose my name, lurked, participated - and _then_ decided to give away that information here.",1312538058

2849553,comment,2849238,2849405,1,0,pierreminik,,,"What is inhalants even? People here don't really hide if they do drugs, believe me. Cannabis is illegal but even police knows who does what, and don't actually do much about it because pushers will beat up anyone trying to sell anything but cannabis, and crime rates rise should any pusher be arrested because the kingpins will withdraw the drug from the market leaving a big demand with very little supply, price rise and people will have to steal things in order to afford the drugs.<p>Crazy-fast was bad choice of words on my behalf, I ment something more like crazy-efficient but I guess no drug makes you that.<p>I can give an part example of things that could improve workflow a great deal for almost anyone with a client that approves graphic work in lets say Photoshop. The tasks that is only related to the stuff you do on the computer would be: making a new document, naming it, (if you work with both print and web you might want different units, rulers and color profiles for either type), making the graphic work, saving it some place associated with the client, exporting it for web in some reduced resolution that is big enough for the client to see the details good enough, opening up your email client or webmail, adding in the clients contact information, maybe you have some form of request tracker that needs an ID field in the email, attaching he file for approval, writing a message for your client, press send. 
Turning all those steps into something more enjoyable like: selecting the client in a dashboard, give the task a name, make the graphic work, save, write a happy message for your client, press send.<p>Adobe allows JS to be used for improving workflow so it would be ideal coming up with a framework that would use JS. Web developers and even most designers already know JS which makes it an ideal choice.<p>How often do you name a file according to a name convention? Whatever text field you enter that name in should just allow you to type the filename not having to think about conventions. If the convention only allows a typical lowercase a-z, 0-9 and dashes only, then the field you type in the name in should convert all characters as you type to lowercase, spaces could even automatically turn into dashes, international characters like , , ,  should perhaps turn into their a-z equivalents, and everything else should be ignored. No errors, no interruptions, just work like you like it.<p>Making an iOS app for both iPhone 4, older iPhones and iPad, you'd have to save the (most likely) same icons and so forth in different resolutions with same prefix but different file naming that allows Xcode to recognize the different versions for the different targets.<p>For every website project you have a starter pack that consists of a bunch of different things, like a css-reset, maybe jQuery, maybe Modernizr, maybe a responsive mobile-first css framework... Downloading to update all those could be a task in it self...<p>You like a certain folder structure maybe but the developer you're gonna pass the work on to for coding the project is really strict about how they should be delivered. The developer could give you a profile-file which the workflow framework would use to run a preparation check of the files, checking images are in correct format, packaging your work so it's ready for the developer.<p>You use Photoshop for something that has to be both printed and for a web campaign, there should be a switch that would make sure stuff like black in the CMYK version is 100% black. You share your Photoshop files between computers? Nothing is more important than having to send fonts back and forth should the other computer not have the font you're using.<p>You've tried spending time trying to figure out why some server-side code is not working as expected only to realize that there is some cached stuff somewhere that is teasing you.
You just saved your changes to the server-side code, you alt+tab, the browser should flush the cache and reload the page when ready.<p>Your website project is ready for production? Minify all the stuff, in some cases you'll merge files, gzip them, ou get the drill...<p>In the end, less frustration, more getting done what you like.

2849542,comment,2846812,2846812,1,0,tuomasb,,,"Assuming DNS resolvers work as they should, most bitflips on the wire shouldn't result to anything else than a failed DNS query since DNS packets include the original requested FQDN in the result.<p>Scenario 1) Lets say we have normal Windows computer asking what is update.microsoft.com as an A-record. The computer's resolver sends its request to its ISP's DNS server it was assigned via DHCP. One bit is flipped on transit and the DNS server receives request to resolve update.mic2osoft.com and it does so. Then it returns the result via UDP telling the Windows computer that update.mic2osoft.com is 1.2.3.4, but the computer's resolver was expecting an answer for update.microsoft.com so it rejects(should reject) the result even though the transaction ID is what it expected. Also UDP checksum poses a problem the recursor could reject the packet and not do anything.<p>Scenario 2) Another scenario is where the bit corrupts on transit while the ISP's DNS recursor is querying the Verisign .com root servers for microsoft.com (assuming it's not cached) and one bit corrupts in transit. Verisign's server answers that mic2osoft.com DNS servers are ns1.mic2rosoft.com and ns2 and it provides the glue records for them (IP addresses) if necessary. DNS recursor receives an answer for mic2rosoft.com while it expects answer for microsoft.com and rejects the result before querying nsX.mic2rosoft.com. UDP checksum also a problem here.<p>Scenario 3) Bit flip on the Windows computer's RAM before gethostbyname() is called so they call gethostbyname(update.mic2osoft.com). Another timeframe for a successful bitflip is while the OS is running gethostbyname(update.microsoft.com) but before the request is sent. gethostbyname() only returns the IP address so the function caller will not know if its wrong. This is the most plausible scenario, ECC is also rare in consumer hardware so that shouldn't pose a problem.<p>Scenario 4) Bit flip on the DNS recursors RAM. This depends on whether the address to be queried is stored in several variables in the DNS server so the DNS answer packet to the Windows computer has the correct FQDN but the DNS server queried for the wrong address due to the bit flip. Servers usually have ECC so this is implausible but not impossible. Also if this happened, the DNS server's cache could also get the incorrect entry and give it out to many many many clients if it was a popular ISP's DNS server.<p>An interesting thought would be what if IP-addresses bit-flipped. If Microsoft had all their update servers in 80.100.2.0/24 and an attacker owned 16.100.2.0/24 with one bit flipped. How much traffic would the network receive? If bit flipped on transit while the server is returning answer for update.microsoft.com UDP checksum should be incorrect but what if a popular ISP's DNS recursor's cache had a flipped IP address for update.microsoft.com. Very implausible but would result in lot of traffic.<p>One more scenario comes to mind about IP bit-flipping. If ns1.microsoft.com was at 5.1.1.1 and an attacker owned 1.1.1.1 he could also configure his DNS server (more specifically the UDP stack on the Linux kernel) to ignore the invalid UDP checksums and serve falsified DNS answers.<p>Seems like the author's DEFCON speak will be held next Sunday, he probably knows much much more about the subject than what I just wrote. I will definitely read his slides/whitepaper.",1312537686

But what time sinks do you have that could be eliminated or reduced?  Most people (at least in America) spend quite a lot of time on just maintaining their personal possessions. I have few personal possessions and it gives me more time for other things. Most people have lots of very inefficient processes in their personal lives and are typically reluctant to consider making changes which would eliminate housework or reduce travel time for common tasks and so on.  For example, many Americans have long commutes to work and complain about how negatively this impacts their lives but will not consider moving to shorten the commute.  (I know that is a poor example for you since you work from home, but it comes to mind because I find it so baffling.  They typically state that they live far away because they don't want work to consume their lives but the net result is that work consumes more of their lives due to the longer commute eating up more of their time.)",1312536390

It's not really any shorter or less bug-prone, and it makes your code harder to follow for people who don't understand map & fold.<p>The real benefit comes from when you understand the <i>concepts</i> behind map and fold.  If you realize that fold is nothing but replacing each n-ary constructor of an algebraic data type with an n-ary function, then you recognize that you can do the same thing for data structures besides sequences, like binary trees, graphs, and ASTs.  <i>There</i> you're getting some benefit, because there's no built-in language syntax for iterating over those.<p><pre><code>  data List a = a : [a] | []
  [1, 2, 3, 4] = (1 : (2 : (3 : (4 : []))))
  foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
  foldr (+) 0 [1, 2, 3, 4] = (1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 0))))
  foldr (*) 1 [1, 2, 3, 4] = (1 * (2 * (3 * (4 * 1))))

  ...by extension ...
  data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a)
  foldTree :: (a -> b) -> (b -> b -> b) -> Tree a -> b
  foldTree f g (Leaf x) = f x
  foldTree f g (Branch x y) = g (foldTree f g x) (foldTree (f g y)
</code></pre>
Then you recognize that the GoF calls this the Visitor pattern, because certain stupid languages don't have higher-order functions or algebraic data types, and so you need to make the equivalencies between concrete subclass => ADT constructor, Visitor => function, and object state => return value.  Suddenly a lot of modularized compiler libraries (eg. LLVM) make a lot more sense.<p>Then you realize that a map is nothing but a list-fold where the binary operation is constrained to be the composition of some arbitrary function of the element together with a cons operator:<p><pre><code>  map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
  map f = foldr ((:) . f) []
</code></pre>
The cool thing about this formalism is that it makes it explicit that f depends only upon the single element of the sequence, and that the ordering of the resulting list is independent of the actions of f.  In other words, map can be parallelized.  And that lays the groundwork for MapReduce, which lays the groundwork for massive-scale parallel data processing.",1312534823

I want to add tomato, but I can't remember if I had a ""get fruits"" category. So I push left, glance down, see that I don't and decide to put tomato into veggies anyway. Then I push right and nothing happens. Instead, where possible, right should move me back, so I can go left-right and be back where I started. Bonus points for left-left-left-right-right-right working :)",1312534817

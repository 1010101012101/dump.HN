Let's leave the ongoing debate about how to ""characterize [their] actions"" until a universal definition of 'freedom' is agreed upon. That should satisfy the monsters.<p>I think Sartre settled this one. We're either wholly determined, or else wholly free. And since consciousness means that fate isn't preordained - we're free. Anyway, in case he was off the mark, the alternative is a boot on a human face and the (real, nazi, concentration) camp that you pretended I was alluding to.<p>As to whether there are degrees of freedom, there's room for them in that philosophy. Take away movement, that's one. Take away speech, that's another. Hey, just go down the bill of rights - you don't have any at summer camp. Is it nazi germany? Did I say that?

3809313,comment,3808370,3808675,12,0,waterhouse,,,"In middle school, some of my friends and I discussed systems for transmitting information about crushes.  Wouldn't it be nice if some trusted person knew everything, and could tell you whether your crush liked you?  But then we faced a certain use case.  One of my friends liked a girl; if she liked him back, obviously he would like to know that; but, he said, if she didn't like him back, then he didn't want to know that, and would prefer to keep hope alive.<p>So, we thought of this: Have some trusted person learn her preferences, and then flip a coin: if heads, then tell him if she likes him (and say nothing otherwise), and if tails, say nothing either way.  This seemed to serve pretty well.  [This was all hypothetical, of course.]<p>I think this is a good koan--something to provoke further thought.  For example:<p>1. This is sort of how a scientific investigation may go.  Suppose you have some theory, and some test that only yields results sometimes: 50% of the time, the test will yield result A, but 50% of the time, it will work properly, and in that case, if your theory is right, then the test will yield result A, and if your theory is wrong, then the test will yield result B.  (Example: ""There are no animals in this area"", and imagine that they'll try to avoid being caught and that you can conduct an exhaustive search of only half of some area at once.  Or: ""Bob isn't holding a key in his hands"", and he'll only let you look at one hand at a time and can switch from hand to hand between searches.)  Repeated testing will let you <i>approach</i> certainty about your theory (but never really reach it).<p>2. One could talk about Bayesian probability and priors.  Especially if one varies the coin's heads/tails probability.<p>3. I think this sort of thing is an actual trope in human interactions.  Some people give ""hints"" of various sorts; to hint proposition P might be defined as ""to decide to do some action X such that, if not-P, then there's a small probability that a generic human in your position would do X, but if P, then there's a high probability that a generic human in your position would do X"".  Other people (well, probably the same people) may perform tests, to put some other person in a position where he might do X or something else, and if P were true, he would do X with high probability, but if not-P, then he would do X with low probability.  And people who resent such ""tests"" may deliberately randomize (or genericize) their behavior.<p>Consider this: Imagine that someone has asked me a question to which, if P, then my answer is rather embarrassing, and if not-P, then my answer is not embarrassing; suppose lying is not an option.  Suppose I am a naive person.  Then, if not-P, I will simply give the non-embarrassing answer, and if P, then I will refuse to answer or something.  Now, if everyone knows I am naive, and P is true, then refusing to answer is futile; everyone can see that and deduce P anyway.<p>Considering the above, I might decide to be a defensive person.  I will recognize questions like that, and at least some of the time, I will simply refuse to answer even though the answer is non-embarrassing.  It seems people do exactly this: refusing to answer ""personal questions"", as they are called, seems to be relatively common behavior.  Even on the scale of just you and someone else, you can establish yourself as a defensive person by refusing to answer a personal question when the answer is innocuous, and maybe revealing the answer through some other means or at another time (be a bit careful: e.g. if you refuse to answer, he pressures you to answer, and you say the innocuous answer, then it would still seem to make sense next time you are <i>pressured</i> and still refuse to answer to deduce the embarrassing answer); then, the next time you refuse to answer a personal question, you have <i>demonstrated</i> that this doesn't necessarily imply that the answer is embarrassing.<p>It seems to me polite to act as though someone has won his status as ""defensive"" without making him work for it, and rude to do the opposite.  Or to make it irrelevant.  ""May I ask <personal question>"" makes it easy for the person to say ""No"" (much more so than just asking the question), which establishes that ""no answer"" might easily happen even if the answer is innocuous.  (I <i>also</i> take the parallel approach that it shouldn't be embarrassing to tell me anything.  I think embarrassment is the anticipated feeling that someone might tease you/put you down for something, and so if telling me something won't lead to that happening, then you needn't be embarrassed to tell me.  Then my task is merely to make that true.)<p>Consider also encryption.  Suppose people are naive.  Then they won't encrypt anything (and do other things to make their information inaccessible to others) unless they have ""something to hide"".  Then goddamn authorities can say ""This person is hiding his stuff, so he is probably guilty, and that's all the evidence we need to justify using forceful means to make him reveal his secrets"", and there is little defense against this.  (In some situations, you may have an obviously ""legitimate"" reason to hide things, like hiding your company's information from your competitors.  But there are other situations, like if the <i>government</i> comes and demands that information (ignore the possibility that they'll leak anything--I imagine the government will claim that's ridiculous, and I imagine most people would buy that), in which those reasons don't apply.)<p>Meanwhile, if people are defensive about encrypting and hiding their stuff, then statements like ""If you had nothing to hide, then you wouldn't be hiding anything"" are obviously false.  Imagine trying to make that accusation of Bruce Schneier or Colin Percival.  Now if only people like that were extremely common, and considered the norm.  (Oh, another example is the ""Don't talk to the police"" crowd.)<p>If nothing else, I consider it rude to demand potentially embarrassing or incriminating information from someone who isn't willing to give it up, and use their response to get that information anyway; and I'd rather rude people not win out relative to non-rude people.",1333752904

You can claim this is a moral thing, but I'd more likely attribute it to finance. New media makes all its money off clicks and views rather than subscriptions, so flash in the pan scoops are much more profitable for them than old media. It isn't incumbent on a journalist to indicate where all everything that contributed to an article came from (that is strictly in a ""nice to have but not essential"" category), just ensure all the information they provide is cited. The OP's article is a dicer situation of clear plagiarism, but I think new media has a dollar sign sized chip in its shoulder about linking and credit.",1333752799

As far as I can tell, it's a lot like C or C++, except that you have to use while loops instead of for loops and you have to perform unholy incantations to fake arrays of structs.  If you don't do this, you can either try to allocate a few hundred million tuples and OutOfMemoryError, or you can allocate one array of a primitive for each field of the struct and give up on the idea of having decent cache locality.  It's less capable of TCO than gcc, which is pretty hilarious for a functional programming language.

Or if another news outlet breaks a story, they independently confirm and don't give attribution, since technically, they confirmed the story, so it's 'their news.' I've only heard a news source attribute another source when news is breaking in real time (i.e. X is reporting 7 are dead at the scene).  Breaking a story != confirming or actually being a journalist's source.<p>In some cases, attribution is very important - like in the original post. However, I think a lot of 'new media' beef with old media practices is just a shift in ideology . Bloggers are closer to the action and transparency is more important.

Working on projects together, sharing gossip at meals and in tents, going on day trips and coming back with pictures and stories. Great stuff. People who spend time camping together share a bond and become potential lifelong friends.<p>When camping was new, relatively few people went camping. The most exciting, adventurous and challenging way to camp is, of course, to bring your own food and gear and rough it, just you and nature.<p>Some businesses saw an opportunity to introduce a lot more people to camping and make some money. They'd build some cabins around a lake and do some marketing. It's not the same, but most people weren't going to rough it in the woods anyway, right?<p>A Harvard kid announced a new camp one day for other Harvard kids. Everyone who was anyone started going to Mark's camp. If you knew people going to this camp, and you wanted to really connect with them, you had to go to Mark's camp to do it. Sure, there were other ways to connect with them, but Mark's camp is where people are spending a lot of their time and Mark's campfire is where they share their stories. In fact, over a tenth the population of planet Earth has made Mark's camp their hangout.<p>You still love camping as much as you ever did, and you want to connect and share stuff with all your family and friends. But it really grates on you that you have to walk through Mark's gate and live by Mark's rules in order to do that. Isn't there some way you could round up a crew, leave Mark's camp behind, and strike out into the wild somewhere, just you and your friends, to do some <i>real</i> camping?",1333750913

However during the transition I was offered some well paid freelance gigs so I didn't end up taking the second job. After 4 years of freelancing and moving out of a big city, I got tired of working alone so I joined a small team in a non-tech company. Six month later, I was getting bored so I looked for work in a major city. I found one startup that did something that sounded interesting, so I sent them an email even though they weren't advertising opened positions. An hour later I got a response, and two weeks later I was working for them. The past 3 months, I got offered 2 jobs and Facebook contacted me for the second time.<p>This isn't even the Silicon Valley -- I live in Europe. Sometimes I wonder if I'm smart or not. I know I probably wouldn't be able to answer all of these trick questions I hear about. I think I'm much better at abstracting concepts and seeing the whole picture. I love programming, but so far I haven't found a place where I can have as much fun as when I am creating software on my own, free of constraints and in control of everything. When I work on my own, every now and then I stop coding, sometimes for days, thinking, sketching, until I know exactly what I'm going to do and can explain why in plain English.<p>Anyways, I think younger programmers might enjoy taking time answering these kinds of question, but I'm the kind of person that wishes he didn't have to sleep so he could spend more time working on his own projects, so I don't bother. If you want me to be interested, you'd have to find a way to convince me that I would be working in an environment that feels like I'm working on my own project.

I have to tell this to my clients (website developers) over and over again - No matter how much you tweak your signup form, the single and best asset you can have in enticing signups is something that the user <i>really, really</i> wants to sign up for.<p>Put differently - There surely is some wiggle room in pushing a couple of percentage points out of your signup statistics, but that often ranges with the margin of statistical error.<p>No optimization will ever make up for asking users to sign up for something they don't actually want or need.<p>While blog posts like this one are nice for people who obsess about optimization, I have seen them do a lot of damage - for instance, I still get people who are convinced that <i>the one thing</i> that is holding back their business is having a four page signup (membership selection, registration details, confirmation, checkout) instead of a three page setup. Some even go so far as to demand that everything should be on a single page.<p>In my experience, there is a clear, inversely proportional relation between the obsession over signup optimization and the value that the website offers to customers.<p>If your website gives out free gourmet food and massages, you can literally require people to fill out ten page forms and ask for confirmation via standard mail - your signup form will still convert users like crazy. At the opposite end of that scale, there are forms like the recent April Fools joke 'Google Nigeria' - the simplest possible form: Enter your Credit Card details and be done.<p>Sorry about the rant, but this (pardon my french) wanking about optimization has produced a lot of endless, annoying discussions with clients who burn up all their time on optimization - time that they should have rather put into having a sound business idea that people would actually care about.<p>(And yes, I know that #5 and #8 go in the same direction as this rant, but they just range in a completely different category and all this just triggered my rage mode.)",1333750409

This has improved over time, but I know plenty of intelligent people who don't understand many of the settings that have been introduced over the years. The product that they signed up for isn't the same as it is today.<p>In regards to the reduced control over your own privacy, it's important to note that your friends can volunteer information about you indirectly by using ""smart lists"". You can tell facebook what city someone is in, what university, whether they are in your family, or if they are a close friend. You can add geographic information to other peoples' photos. Also, because of the different levels of update subscriptions, Facebook has made it favorable for people to use the ""Life Stories"" feature of their profiles/timeslines because they don't know which friends have unsubscribed from seeing ""all updates"" (""most important"" updates most likely implies Life Stories).<p>Also, certain features still have no privacy. Answers to all Facebook Questions are public on your profile. Even as intimate with the privacy settings that I am, I didn't know this! So you either have to not use the feature (which would require knowing about the privacy setting before using it), or deleting these answers after making them.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that so many people make public posts on Facebook, that you can't comment on any of those without your comments also being public. Most people don't care. So the network is becoming more public, with less opportunity to stay private. And remember that when you comment on those public posts, your comment is shown in the ticker and newsfeeds of your friends (which, in my opinion, is a violation of my privacy. Just because I comment on something doesn't mean I want it notified to my friends). These two actions of public posts have no privacy options... the only thing you can do is avoid commenting on public posts.",1333749847

The iPad sought to target usage cases where a &quot;full&quot; laptop or desktop wasn&#x27;t ideal.  In doing so, it also left out several laptop/desktop capabilities that people might <i>want</i> to keep and missed.<p>After the mobile-grade tablet market was established by iPad and, later, other brands of devices, the Surface seems intended to offer the things people liked about tablets versus laptops or desktops (extreme portability, multitouch, etc) and has at least attempted to add back the things many people might have missed when using those mobile-class tablets such as greater flexibility in file management, the ability to install software from multiple sources, choose your own defaults, and run more capable software packages.<p>It&#x27;s certainly had its tradeoffs and the greater power and flexibility meant it couldn&#x27;t be <i>quite</i> as portable as a tablet or work <i>quite</i> as well in certain cases as a traditional laptop but it&#x27;s been interesting to see how these companies seem to target audiences that aren&#x27;t happy with certain aspects of dominant products.<p>The end result (for me at least) is that I&#x27;ve learned there&#x27;s no &quot;perfect&quot; device or form factor that has all the pros and none of the cons in all situations.  That said, more options certainly does make it easier to find something closer to what you&#x27;re looking for.

Sure I would like interactivity, no I don&#x27;t want to re-eval my entire codebase on every keystroke, and no I don&#x27;t want to recreate my vertex data every frame in the Draw method just so I can scrub a tree&#x27;s bendiness.<p>2. The card wiki is too reliant on perfect structure. What if I need to change the structure at some point (refactor), then all my queries break. They&#x27;ll break even worse too if my queries just says &#x27;get the salaries per department&#x27;, but then I modify the structure to have two sets of employees per dept (perhaps current and ex-employees), which changes the meaning of the query, yet the computer would plod along and now wrongly sum both groups I presume, if working in this automated way.<p>3. Performance. Sure it&#x27;s easy to re-calculate an equation based on dependencies. Want to do &#x27;a = b + c&#x27;? Then obviously re-calc &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;c&#x27; dependencies before performing the equation. But the hard part is when to do the re-calculation? Perhaps store an &#x27;isDirty&#x27; bool? Or cache the value? Or just re-calc everytime it&#x27;s needed? Human programmers make this decision based on how the result is used, how many times it is used, framerate, memory consumption and performance heuristics. There isn&#x27;t a one size fits all, it&#x27;s highly contextual.<p>4. You say &#x27;we know Wikipedia works&#x27;. But have you tried scraping data from Wikipedia? Computers get stuck on all sorts of dumb stuff. Wikipedia is obviously meant for human consumption, where visual data and the English language rule, and the only structure we need is a &#x27;top to bottom&#x27; layout. Programming is way more specific that this, so I can&#x27;t see how combining the two ideas is any good.<p>5. Organisation. Perhaps you&#x27;re still working on this, but you switched back and forth between a single card at a time, but given 20+ cards I&#x27;m not going to remember where stuff is.

Generally, I’m a fan of a diverse set of assets for survivability and cost.  Focus on specific missions instead of trying to do everything.  For Air-to-Air the Mig-21 Bison is an interesting example of upgradable lower tech aircraft.[1]  Currently, I think the ability to go fast is still an asset to defeat missiles and would be a severe limitation of a slower platform (okay if it’s unmanned and cheap though). High tech stealthier fighters with lower tech fighters and drones in support.  Mainly all working as missile trucks or targeting platforms.<p>For a mission such as Close Air Support the perfect tools are the AC-130 [2] and the Super Tacano. [3]  For Strike I think drones, cruise missiles, and JSOW [4] are the main way to go.  As for Air-to-Air, a mix of assets is critical so defeating one doesn’t defeat others, and they can’t all depend on one commonality such as GPS.  Would probably keep a few high tech and more lower tech manned bombers available and ready too.<p>Complicated, interesting problem with strategy, logistics, and politics all involved, but the bankrupt the country super weapons definitely is the correct course in my opinion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forum.keypublishing.com/showthread.php?121375-MiG-21-still-unpleasant-surprise-at-Cope-India-exercise-how-so"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.keypublishing.com/showthread.php?121375-MiG-21-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_AC-130"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_AC-130</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_EMB_314_Super_Tucano"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_EMB_314_Super_Tucano</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-154_Joint_Standoff_Weapon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-154_Joint_Standoff_Weapon</a>",1454095604

My thoughts:<p>> 1) There is no integer type!<p>Yup, problem. See also Lua. [I suppose in JS one could create a typed array and use the items as integer-typed variables (?). But who wants to do that?]<p>> 2) JavaScript’s loose typing and aggressive coercions exhibit odd behaviour.<p>I call this a non-issue. If a give-me-this-object function has the possibility of failure, then it should return a truthy value on success and a falsy value on failure. But in all other circumstances, just avoid the implicit type conversions.<p>> 3) Automatic semicolon insertion.<p>Yeah, it was tried in JS and in Go. I think it turned out to be a bad idea in both cases. Let&#x27;s not build it into any more PLs, okay?<p>> 4) JavaScript is seriously abused.<p>Not a problem with JavaScript.<p>There are many idiots in the world. Try not to let them ruin your day.<p>> 5) JavaScript is highly dependent on global variables.<p>I think this is a problem with common JavaScript APIs, not JavaScript <i>per se</i>. But, yes, it is a problem.<p>> 6) JavaScript code can fail silently due to syntactical slip-ups.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s annoying.<p>> 7) Prototype objects do not scale well to large applications.<p>Hmmm ... no explanation. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the issue is. But then I&#x27;ve never written any large-scale JS code based on a hardcore OO design philosophy.<p>And later:<p>> ... [ES6] classes are not as completely fleshed out as you would find in Smalltalk and C++, for example.<p>The &quot;completely fleshed out&quot; classes in C++ are insanely complicated, with whole books covering their details & pitfalls. Let&#x27;s not go there. And the Smalltalk OO model has been largely abandoned for years -- perhaps for good reason?<p>> 8) Asynchronous programming in JavaScript is very messy.<p>Sure, but I think of this as more of a <i>challenge</i>. We&#x27;re really just learning the ins & outs of large-scale asynchronous code. I look forward to seeing how JS and other PLs evolve to handle these issues.<p>> 9) ... Lisp is a wonderful language and by extension, so is JavaScript. But JavaScript is nothing like Lisp!<p>Is this a problem?<p>> 10) The main draw of JavaScript is actually in frameworks like Node.js and AngularJS. If not for them, why would you use JavaScript???<p>Because it&#x27;s the only PL with native support in all major web browsers?",1454095214

I shared links to issues to customers and coworkers countless times and included them in reports. A web client solves at least one problem, maybe two. First, they might not want to install (or pay for) another tool. Second, Ship references issues with the ship:// url, which won&#x27;t work unless you have Ship installed. A <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> url would work for everybody but then you need to share two different URLs which would be cumbersome. I&#x27;m sure you already found a solution to that.<p>Your site doesn&#x27;t address explicitly one fundamental aspect: the data are hosted on your server, like issues stored in GitHub, Jira, etc and you&#x27;re selling the service, or will be. Is this correct? What&#x27;s the pricing? Thanks.",1454094820

To be up front, we know very little about it and the other night was the first time I&#x27;d ever tried to use a screen reader, so it&#x27;s something we aren&#x27;t likely to be good at right of the gate, but it is something we&#x27;ve been setting ourselves up for completely by accident.<p>Many of the previous versions of Eve would be pretty completely inaccessible, so your dismissal would definitely be warranted. The version we&#x27;ve decided to run with though basically has three parts: a document editor, embedded spreadsheet cells, and a fancy plain english search. All three of which have a history of accessible solutions, so that makes me much more optimistic that we can provide something nice here. Along the way, another thing we&#x27;ve been very cognizant about is making sure no matter what form of input you prefer, Eve should be efficient and useful to you whether you&#x27;re using a keyboard, a mouse, or touch. Many of the interaction issues we&#x27;d need to solve to better work with screen readers popup when trying to support complete keyboardability, but I have no delusion that there will be plenty more to solve there. Another interesting aspect of this version of Eve is it&#x27;s really easy to imagine a voice interface to since virtually everything is done using plain english queries - it&#x27;d be kind of like having Jarvis in your google docs.<p>Admittedly, we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing when it comes to accessibility, but it is something we&#x27;ve been thinking about indirectly and it&#x27;s something I think we can at least do more naturally than the code editors of the world.<p>Thanks for raising the issue and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d like to have a more concrete answer for in the future.",1454094723

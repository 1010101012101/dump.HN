People pushing a surveillance agenda (esp. marketing) often extrapolate this awareness, suggesting that people are surrendering privacy willingly either because they don&#x27;t care or as part of a &quot;trade&#x27; for services.<p>In reality[1], people often feel <i>powerless</i>. Without the necessary technical knowledge to create alternatives, the aggressively pushed surveillance option seems like the only choice.<p>> &quot;well anyone who doesn&#x27;t want their data exposed should know better.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s classic victim blaming.<p>I think the common &quot;this isn&#x27;t surprising&quot; response has some victim blaming in it, too, when it becomes a thought-terminating cliche.

They had Bell Labs 1ESS switches that they were trying to turn into computers running Unix. But after the break up the Baby Bells used IBM System 36 computers instead. My father&#x27;s skills were obsolete and he struggled to find work. I taught him how to use a PC and Windows and then later on gave him a LiveCD to boot Linux in case his Windows XP got messed up. He liked Linux better because he could do Unix commands in it. He passed away in 2010.<p>When I was young there was the Telephone Pioneers that my father was a part of, and they had picnics and meetings. When I heard about the Bell Labs work on Unix and C, and Dennis Ritchie I decided to become a programmer. The only thing I could learn at age 12 was BASIC. I didn&#x27;t learn C until 1987 at a community college. I tried a four year college first but could not afford it.

There&#x27;s been so many &quot;Javascript fatigue&quot; articles and I think projects like these help solve issues stitching up many small npm libraries together to make a cohesive web app. Even if you&#x27;re familiar with all the libraries in the React/Redux/Webpack ecosystem (and I&#x27;m not - I&#x27;ve only used React & Redux for small side projects), I think there&#x27;s a tremendous value in knowing that these sets of libraries at these versions are compatible with each other.<p>While it&#x27;s nice to have small dependencies that you can swap out over time as your use case evolves or as the ecosystem progresses, most of the time I&#x27;d just like to use the &quot;standard stack&quot; for a given platform. As someone who primarily uses Angular, one of the main benefits I see of Angular&#x27;s &#x27;kitchen-sink&#x27; approach is that you get a lot of standard functionality right out of the box (e.g. routing, i18n, animation) without having to research the best community package for that particular functionality. However, I think it&#x27;s the narrow focus of React on the &#x27;View&#x27; layer that&#x27;s made it so widely adopted, because it plays well with an existing stack.<p>Having a project like this seems like the best of both worlds - libraries like React can focus on excelling in a single concern and developers still get a curated set of standard functionality so they can setup a complete web app.",1454301759

But that&#x27;s just work. Have fun teaching people about their retirement plans without algebra. Balancing their budgets/checkbooks. Estimating costs of things. Understanding risk. Making decisions about anything that involves quantity. Should I have to call and pay a professional algebra-expert to understand and make decisions about my credit card? How will I know if he overcharges me?<p>>This is an ideological statement more than anything else. I can just as easily say it&#x27;s much more important for educated citizens to learn history and philosophy, so they can understand how the social structures around them work.<p>Of course it&#x27;s ideological; the entire project of education based on a mix of ideology and a purely a capitalist endeavor designed to provide government subsidized job training for tomorrow&#x27;s workers. I absolutely agree with you about history and philosophy, but we aren&#x27;t talking about removing history or philosophy from the curriculum, we are talking about removing science and mathematics. I think /every/ student should learn physics and biology and philosophy and history and rhetoric and statistics at least at a rudimentary level -- half of which require, among other things, mathematics.<p>Having a sense of how something generally is from what you learned a long time ago in high school is intangible but very valuable. Does it really matter where or what Asia is, or whether or not it&#x27;s a continent? Does it matter whether America was founded 200 years ago or 2000 years ago? Does it matter what the Bill of Rights says? For the vast majority of people, no. But it&#x27;s important to have a sense for the world as it is. The universal children&#x27;s curriculum is a tiny slice of human knowledge given to everyone so that nobody is as ignorant in any topic (save perhaps subsistence farming) as the humans of 1000 years ago were. That&#x27;s called progress.<p>>I think it&#x27;s a lot more useful to teach a kid that here are fallacious ways of trying to prove a point--something they can use in real life--than teaching them about the periodic table or cell division<p>Informal logic and rhetoric would be a welcome addition to a curriculum that often doesn&#x27;t include any sort of philosophical reasoning at all, I agree. But I think it&#x27;s useful for a different reason. Argumentation is NEVER about deductive reasoning or being correct in real life, which is why formal deduction and logic is completely useless outside of a classroom -- even more useless than the periodic table or cell division. Real life is only about persuasion. And the list of logical fallacies is a list of effective persuasive techniques: if they weren&#x27;t effective ways to fallaciously argue nobody would ever bother mentioning them. So I&#x27;m a little torn on teaching high school students lists of highly effective rhetorical weapons. I&#x27;ve seen the consequences of having them unleashed on internet commenters and the results so far are grim.",1454301458

It seems like at this point to get the same level of tooling and libraries with Elixir you need to be comfortable with Erlang, or at least consuming it as a library.<p>Another competitor is Go.

But forget about that aspect for a moment, and consider the firmware a mostly unchangeable part of the hardware.<p>Hardware has bugs. A lot of hardware has had bugs for a long time. Linux has had tables of &quot;quirks&quot; for hardware pci ids / usb ids / etc. for a long time, for thousands of buggy hardware devices it needs work-arounds for. Some of those bugs are really in hardware, some are in the firmware loaded on the hardware, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. This is a pervasive reality, and it can&#x27;t just be demanded that the user get hardware which is not &quot;shitty&quot; by this metric ... it&#x27;s all a trade-off.<p>And finally, I&#x27;ve used linux on bios systems and efi systems, and I&#x27;ve never needed efivars mounted, I&#x27;ve always set up the bootloader some other way (which was simpler for me to control and manage as I prefer). My personal biggest complaint about systemd is how it automatically mounts and starts and uses all kinds of stuff that I don&#x27;t need. I prefer to set up what I need and want, and not have anything else cluttering up my system, just waiting to cause serious reliability or security problems, and getting in my way when I&#x27;m debugging something else.<p>So I&#x27;ll be up-voting all stories about &quot;systemd did something automatically and on some systems it was unfortunate&quot; because yeah, UNFORTUNATE STUFF HAPPENS WHEN STUFF HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY. This is why I left windows and OS X in the first place! So I had easy and convenient control over my computer! And now it takes extra effort to override and disable all the crap that systemd is doing automatically, and I resent it.

You skipped the part where I said those where the first two results of a search that took me 5 seconds.  You can find other examples pertaining to deficiencies in lean body mass, vitamin D, and (IIRC) testosterone in men.  The cortisol literature also gives very mixed results, so while I suspect the causes are actually not related to veganism <i>per se</i>, I seriously question the purported protective effects thereupon.<p>Again, I&#x27;ve given you all the tools to learn about this on your own, but you&#x27;d apparently rather quote &quot;plant positive&quot; than cultivate an interest in science.<p>Best of luck.",1454299606

The problem I&#x27;m concerned about is localized heating. Marine life is far more vulnerable to rapid temperature changes than life on land. We&#x27;ve seen dead zones developing in the past downstream of power-plants, as the warm water discharge from the steam turbines raises the temperature of the water and reduces its oxygen carrying capability. My concern is that if we put datacenters in the ocean, they&#x27;ll create localized hot-spots with much the same result.",1454299568

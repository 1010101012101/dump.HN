6709500,comment,6706402,6706402,1,0,memracom,,,"Do you think that Camel and SOLR and Scala are worth learning? If yes, then learn some Java as well, but remember that the world of today is different than the world when most Java books were written and most Java curriculums were designed. In other words Java is NOT going to dominate the world, is NOT even going to dominate the Enterprise, and not everything in the Java ecosystem is going to last. But some parts are damn good, like Oracle&#x27;s JVM, 3rd party commercial JVMs, Camel, Groovy, Scala, SOLR, Lucene, many of the projects in the Apache foundation, Eclipse, IntelliJ, many or the projects from Spring.IO, and so on.<p>It is probably not worth your while to become proficient with J2EE but some bits of it like JDBC are still widely useful. If you do decide to tackly J2EE be aware that you are walking the same path of the COBOL programmers of old, and you will likely spend the rest of your professional life working with Java J2EE enterprise stuff that suffers severely from the Big Ball of Mud and various other antipatterns. I guess that someone has to do it, but I also guess that most people on HN are like me, and are want to always learn new platforms and apply the latest knowledge coming out of the computer science academic world. We want to speed up innovation, and plain Java is not where it is at.",1384134984

6709488,comment,6708800,6709429,16,0,danenania,,,"I see go as essentially a polished and robust glue language. It&#x27;s not particularly well suited to data processing because its lack of functional constructs and generics makes transforming lists verbose, but it&#x27;s perfect for wiring up databases, apis, system calls, sockets, queues, and the like in a way that&#x27;s safe, performant, and concurrent by default.<p>Given this focus, it sort of makes sense why you might not miss a repl as much in go (though personally I do still miss it). Repls are most useful for exploring and experimenting with complex data, while I think go&#x27;s focus is more on streamlining and bulletproofing all the machinery surrounding the data than doing a whole lot with the data itself.<p>I don&#x27;t mean this as a criticism and I&#x27;m not trying to say that you can&#x27;t do serious data processing in go, just that it&#x27;s not a core strength like it is in functional languages. I think the majority of applications out there actually have fairly light data processing needs and heavy glue needs, so go&#x27;s set of tradeoffs make it a great candidate for tons of projects.",1384134765

6709479,comment,6706125,6708984,2,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Many of those you listed were covered specifically in the article, and I believe the author cites sound reasons why the supposed differentiation doesn&#x27;t add the claimed value. I tend to agree with the author for the most part, though I think some of his refutations are as theoretical as the assertions of claimed value he is refuting. Grain of salt though, as I don&#x27;t claim expertise with these altcoin  beyond general familiarity. I would be curious to know what you think of his opinions re: the altcoins you mentioned.<p>Still, I think the overarching point (at least in my view) is that what is overlooked most is that Bitcoin&#x27;s greatest value at this point is the network effect. By far, it is the closest thing we have to a consensus on an alternative currency. So, it is not enough for a new coin to present some incremental benefit. It most be unquestionably superior in some fundamental ways. Remember, these altcoin aren&#x27;t just competing with Bitcoin. They are competing with fiat.<p>So, the sheer number of altcoin popping up tends to devalue the lot. BTW, I actually believe that Bitcoin has some fundamental weaknesses that need to be addressed. Some of these may be so foundational to Bitcoin, that it may actually require a new altcoin to fix them. For instance, confirmation time is one such issue. So, it&#x27;s not that I am swooning over BTC as the perfect currency. I just haven&#x27;t yet seen anything that offers a compelling alternative when the BTC ecosystem, network effect, and inertia are considered.<p>EDIT: BTW, the idea of having a bunch of different altcoin, each catered to a certain &quot;niche&quot; strikes me as especially odd for a currency. As we&#x27;ve seen with BTC, it is difficult enough to gain widespread adoption for even a single alt currency. It is hard to see multiple niche currencies gaining the necessary critical mass to breakout, nor the desirability of managing such from a user perspective.. I am not being facetious in saying that the idea of assigning some niche value to a particular currency seems an excuse for the lack of true differentiation, and an  acknowledgement that the currency represents only some minor or incremental benefit.",1384134537

We get so much of our feedback from our sales team as to what features potential customers are looking for, what features are selling new business, and what missing features are making the sales process harder.<p>A good salesperson (and sales engineer, and contract person, etc.) keeps the relationship two-way, and might make it harder for the engineers in the short term, but generally lead towards a much easier to sell product.

6709450,comment,6708664,6708664,39,0,moron4hire,,,"So, you&#x27;re going to go through some changes. Be ready to forget what weekends mean. You&#x27;ll probably start getting frustrated with weekends, because you&#x27;ll wonder &quot;where the hell did all of these people come from?&quot;.<p>I highly suggest adopting an alternate wake/sleep schedule. Or rather, I highly suggest not resisting the change away from the &quot;normal&quot; 9-to-5 schedule that everyone else accepts upon them. I personally went to bed at sunrise and got up around noon. I also put work at the end of my day, rather than the beginning, which allowed me to pay attention to my health in a way I&#x27;ve never been able to accomplish otherwise. You have no reason to work their schedule, yet you&#x27;ll end up A) getting stuck in their lines and traffic, B) paying their restaurant/bar/movie rates, and C) missing out on one of two amazing worlds: extreme late night or extreme early morning. The people you will meet there will be the most fascinatingly unconventional people in the world and they will inspire you to do great things. The fact that you are on this journey probably means you&#x27;re one of them anyway. Go find your people. The people of the night are a close-knit community and help each other out in ways you can&#x27;t imagine.<p>Now that I&#x27;m married, that doesn&#x27;t work out too well, but I&#x27;m working on getting her to eventually be able to take the night as well :P<p>You&#x27;ll probably end up working <i>constantly</i>. Learn how to take a day off: honest-to-goodness unproductive time (it takes you out of the fight-or-flight mode and gives your body a chance to recover). You probably won&#x27;t be able to stand more than one day of it, as you&#x27;ll get antsy and start feeling a need to make something. But it&#x27;s necessary to unwind. Play video games all day. Go to the zoo. Watch movies. See your friends.<p>Don&#x27;t think you can extend your runway with credit cards. You can&#x27;t extend a blanket by cutting off the tail and sewing it to the top.<p>Stay open to opportunities. Make sure you keep meeting people. People are where the opportunities come from. Nobody is going to hunt you down and give you a chance.<p>It&#x27;s better to take part-time work that pays the bills than it is to take full-time work that gives you lots of disposable income. Your time is far more valuable than anything any employer will be willing to give you. That&#x27;s kind of the point, if your time were actually worth $80,000/yr, then they&#x27;d probably only hire you at minimum wage. Keep your time for yourself. If you live in a big city, you might be able to get by on bartending in a popular place on weekends. It&#x27;s better than sitting in a cubicle farm.<p>You probably won&#x27;t make it. Unfortunately, 6 months just isn&#x27;t that much time. Oh, I think it&#x27;s enough time to build just about anything, if the resolve is there and the freedom to work however you want (work tends to fill the time you give it, and most slowness in projects is the bureaucracy from which you are now free). But you&#x27;ll learn that there is a lot more to making a project happen than the build phase. For example, if you haven&#x27;t done any marketing yet, before the product is complete, you&#x27;re already very behind schedule. You&#x27;ll have to learn how to do all of those things that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> programming, because otherwise you won&#x27;t know what to look for to hire an effective person to do it for real.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean the time isn&#x27;t worth while, but you need to know how to use it wisely and not become despondent if/when you finally cave and get a &quot;real job.&quot; Use this time to learn as much as you can. Specifically, try to learn about yourself, i.e. how to motivate yourself to work on a consistent and regular schedule, how to get yourself out of ruts. You&#x27;ll learn what you&#x27;re capable of pulling off, even when you weren&#x27;t sure what to do at the beginning.<p>And if you do &quot;fail&quot;, pick up the pieces, dust yourself off, and get ready to try again.<p>This experience will change you. Try to let it change you as much as possible.",1384133900

(It&#x27;s difficult for statically-typed languages to provide one.)  It&#x27;s commonly believed that a REPL is valuable and increases productivity.  So if you were offered the choice, is there any circumstance in which &quot;no REPL&quot; is equally powerful as having one?  Well, the vast majority of great hackers seem to agree that it&#x27;s always superior to have a REPL than to be forced to live without.<p>Lots of people love programming in Golang (I especially love to write distributed systems with it!) yet it probably won&#x27;t ever offer us a REPL.    That must mean one of two possibilities are true, both of which are bizarre: either 1) we love Go in spite of being limited by not having a REPL, or 2) having a REPL isn&#x27;t as big of a deal as everyone thought.<p>So I&#x27;d like to ask all of you: Do we love Go in spite of being held back by it?  If so, then what are the factors that cause us to decide that using Go is worth giving up programming power?  After all, each of us are <i>choosing</i> to use Go in lieu of more powerful languages.  So why do we choose to give up programming power?<p>Or do you believe in the other possibility: having a REPL doesn&#x27;t matter as much as everyone thought?  That seems plausible.  It&#x27;s at least as plausible as &quot;it&#x27;s a good idea to give up REPLs for static typing.&quot;<p>Go is wonderful to work with.  But I&#x27;m so confused why it feels wonderful to me.  I know I love programming in it, but once I start thinking about the implications, I start to wonder:  Isn&#x27;t giving up power a bad thing, and therefore choosing to use Go == choosing to be forever held back by its deficits, and therefore it&#x27;s a bad decision?  Or is it true that having every possible language feature available to you (&quot;maximum potential programming power,&quot; i.e. as far above Blub as possible) isn&#x27;t as big a deal as we all thought?<p>This pg essay talks about why it&#x27;s worthwhile to have as much power as possible:  <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a> (search for Blub Paradox) .... So either he&#x27;s wrong, or we&#x27;re ignoring him even though he&#x27;s right.  Which is it?<p>EDIT:  There are other limitations besides lacking a REPL, e.g. there&#x27;s no dynamic typing.  It seems like we should try to figure out why it&#x27;s a good idea to give up any programming power at all.",1384133294

It would seem sensible if this was reflected in a fundamental property of information.<p>Maybe a fundamental limit of the universe is that the minimum surface area of a volume containing a subatomic structure is related to the information required to define that structure?  My maths is a bit fuzzy, but isn&#x27;t there a fundamental relationship between a volume its boundary, involving a Fourier Transform?

You don&#x27;t need to compile for every platform you wan&#x27;t to run your software in, or muck around with cross-compilers. True, you can do plattform-spesific things in any language, but the Java standards library is almost entirely cross-plattform. In this way, Java really is as cross-platform as it gets.<p>The language itself is more secure. Buffer overflow? Forget about it. Undefined behaviour? Forget about it.

Any program you write that will be running for more than 10 seconds and don&#x27;t run in a memory strained environment, fits Java rather well.<p>Java is also easier to learn and reason about IMHO than C++.<p>Java today is the easier, safer, more portable but slower and memory-hungry edition of C++.

This is where I&#x27;m the cynical one in the sense that I don&#x27;t see the point of having a visionary mission statement if you have to resort to spin and propaganda tactics to convince your employees to buy into it.<p>The qualification of &quot;worthwhile&quot; is really subjective to the point where unless you&#x27;re literally doing something truly impactful (which I define as value + massive scale, e.g., cure to cancer, etc.), your value is at best a surface scratch and at worst a fad.<p>Consumer oriented startups like Snapchat spring to mind, which seems to have both a questionable mission statement + a shameless pursuit of founder enrichment.  Not judging (I&#x27;m jelly), but I do think it serves the greater point I&#x27;m trying to make.",1384131999

Topics evolve in real world conversation all the time, that&#x27;s how people think and make connections. The question&#x27;s really how you organise things - how you filter attention, and what tools there are for that to allow people interested in certain aspects of the discussion to see the bits they&#x27;re likely to be interested in. Not every video needs a full blown forum underneath it, but I honestly doubt that one would occur even if you made the threads groupable at arbitrary levels - there just wouldn&#x27;t be the static central point of contact with multiple people checking back that a forum seems to need, (i.e. I can&#x27;t imagine people would keep on and on reloading the video,) and some sort of decent threading seems strongly indicated.<p>If you lack such tools, it seems to me that the only things people are liable to post if you take the length restriction off is the full text of books to try and crash the browser, ASCII art of male genitalia, and links to some of the more ewww corners of the internet. In the time it takes someone to post something well thought out someone can post twenty ASCII penises after all. The low-effort to high-lols expressions seem likely to dominate over the high-effort high-meaning expressions.<p>Sort of like how Reddit decayed, but with a somewhat darker tone since the existing community in the comments is less well developed than they started off with, there&#x27;d be even fewer tools, less effective moderation and you won&#x27;t be able to hide niche communities behind unknown lookup names as well.",1384131842

Something I have trouble putting into words but I know from experience is there - when I am working on some process I try to understand it deeply and ask questions that are often more business related than technical.

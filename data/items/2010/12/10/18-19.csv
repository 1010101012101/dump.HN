1992706,story,,,1,1,ookblah,"Ask HN: Distribution Channels and ""Traction""",,"Hi all,<p>I'm fairly new here and have recently become addicted to HN (lol), but I thought I'd try to reach out and see if I can gain any insight.  My friend and I have been working on our startup for the last 7 months.  Our product is serving the non-profit space which has a culture of being slow to adopt, technologically backward, hands on, etc.<p>We had launched a pilot with a handful of organizations and gotten good feedback, but a lot of it was hands on work (services) that we did to validate some core concepts.  Moving forward, we wanted to automate a lot of those tasks so that we can scale more easily and have now launched our ""beta"".<p>That was two weeks ago.  I guess that's not really a lot of time at all, and knowing our market... there would be a much slower adoption cycle, but does anybody else get <i>really</i> discouraged at this time?  Our issue is that it's hard to validate or test anything when you don't have a stream of feedback.  We have been trying to hit up any channel we can (cold calling, tapping our networks, referrals, etc.) and so far it's be lukewarm.<p>Jumping from a ""semi-services"" role to more product focused feels like a step backward (as in, maybe the value WAS in those services offered..ugh), but we didn't want to go down the consulting road.  Maybe we need an adjustment of our expectations and to continue plugging away at different channels.<p>Anyway, this probably sounds like a lot of babbling.  Any input appreciated.  Thanks all.",1292007561

All of this amounts to a (very inefficient) parallel implementation of an algorithm that checks whether the Bellman-Ford conditions apply to a suboptimal path, as the path is gradually improved.<p>The Bellman-Ford condition on an arc (i,j) of a graph G constrains the difference of potential between the two nodes i and j, (y_j - y_i), to be no more than the length c_ij of the arc. When it is violated, a better path can be found by modifying the potentials.<p>The inefficiency here lies in the random nature of these checks, which (if I correctly understood) modify. A much more intuitive algorithm is Bellman-Ford's algorithm, which works even when some arc costs are negative, while Dijkstra's algorithm, much more efficient, can only be applied on non-negative arc costs.<p>Networks with millions of nodes (such as GPS road networks) could hardly benefit from this ant-colony algorithm, and there are already better algorithms -- see the work by Andrew Goldberg, for instance (<a href=""http://www.avglab.com/andrew"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avglab.com/andrew</a>).",1292007184

1992650,comment,1992433,1992433,0,0,verysimple,,,"One common mistake when one tries to tackle the web is to do it all at once. What you need:<p>- get familiar with HTML and css. That is, learn the basics, their purpose and how they interact.<p>- get familiar with some basic JavaScript and how you use it on the browser.<p>- learn one of the prominent web languages for the server-side. Python, Ruby, PHP, etc. I used to recommend PHP as a first language because compared to other languages, it was ubiquitous amongst hosting providers. Nowadays, I recommend against, especially if you already have some programming experience. Python and Ruby also have a decent offering and they have the added benefit of a community that generally promotes <i>better</i> programming practices than PHP.<p>Having an overview of the entire development process, you should now be able to pick one area where you'd like to expand. Being a programmer I suspect you might pick either server-side or browser scripting (JavaScript). Stick to one at first and learn it well. When I started the web I rarely did any front-end at all. I concentrated on the server-side and was aided by some CSS and JavaScript coders. Likewise, I often worked with JS programmers who didn't want to know anything beyond the realm of what they were doing. It's a symbiotic relationship. \n-  It may be tempting to do everything vanilla at first, but quickly switch to using a framework, they're often packed with lots of best practices. They're like training wheels, you can always take them off later when you feel confident.<p>As you get comfortable with one field you can expand on others. After years playing in the server, I'm only now expanding my client side skills. Also, beyond technologies, other areas of interest that can expand your overall understanding and web expertise, are interface architecture, usability and various other optimizations.

My girlfriend, a smart cookie, asked to see ""how I made the phone ring"" and, after I showed her the code that did that, told me it had never even occurred to her that every program she's ever seen was once a collection of special words placed in a particular order.]<p>After that, it was pretty much done, except for the marketing.<p>On the plus side: you can learn one or a few of these things at a time, and get more comfortable with how deep the rabbit hole goes as you go along.

But at the same time I don't at all buy into its premise.<p>Literally every field I have even a passing interest in has got people at the top of it who express interest in multiple fields at once. In the web-related world there's Shaun Inman, who goes back and forth between music, web design, and creating video games. Or there's Ze Frank, who goes back and forth between writing and designing tools and music and video comedy and I don't know what else. In music there are a <i>lot</i> of people who specialize in many, many different things at once — either different types of music (multiple instruments, or multiple performance styles, or music production) — or actively in different fields at once. Peter Brotzmann, one of the best free jazz saxophonists, is also a graphic designer who's designed all of his albums to date. Tom Waits is a musician who acts and writes on the side. Auteur directors tend to be involved in five or six different fields at once: James Cameron is a masterful set/costume designer; David Lynch handles the audio production for his movies; and writes some of the music for it. Stand-up comic Louis CK writes, stars in, directs, <i>and</i> edits his show Louie, which is to some degree <i>insane</i>.<p>The problem with looking at the Internet for polymaths of the same caliber of Carl Djerassi is that the Internet generation is too young right now. Ze Frank, who is in some ways the grandfather of the modern Internet creative movement, is only thirty-eight years old. The <i>real</i> Internet generation, of the people who literally never existed in a world where the World Wide Web didn't, was born in 1990. They're twenty years old. They're me.<p>I can assure you as somebody who's closer to that generation than most of the users on that site: We're going to see an explosion of creativity the likes of which we haven't seen in decades, if ever. The kids I know in high school are busy writing, drawing, making music, arguing philosophy, arguing economics, doing pretty much everything and doing it all at once. Give it thirty years and I think you'll be flabbergasted at what we produce.<p>When I was eighteen I'd already published a novel, directed a play, written and co-performed a song, co-created said song's music video, performed and co-wrote a Harry Potter dub, wrote multiple essays, and designed a number of web sites. A friend of mine who's a year younger was keeping a political/economic blog and engaging in discussions pretty much everywhere. Yet another friend is a hypnotist, writer, and web designer who I might be making a documentary about this coming summer. The guy I live with, twenty-one, is a talented actor who's also written for the Colbert Report, interviewed celebrities, and in his free time sells tickets.

If class A has method a, and class B subclasses a, can B override method a? In what sense is B an A if it does not obey Strict Liskov Substitutability?<p>The second problem is that re-use is an easy problem to solve in any language. We have delegation, we have proxies, we have so many tools. Why use inheritance, which mixes two different concepts (is-a and was-a a/k/a is-implemented-using)?<p>Lastly, how is the code more conducive to later changes? In my experience, you now have a problem where changing class A changes the behaviour of every class that extends A. This is a notoriously tricky problem in the real world. In theory, that change ought to change every subclass and inheritance is a win. In practice, the people writing all those subclasses did so making assumptions about the behaviour of A at the time it was written, much as there are billions of lines of windows code that depend on its bugs and break the moment you fix a bug.<p>Encapsulation is a wonderful thing. I do not see implementation inheritance as having anything whatsoever to do with encapsulation. If anything, I see the opposite.<p>If I write that B is-a A, if these things are fully encapsulated, shouldn't it be a black box as to how B manages to behave exactly like an A? Maybe there's some shared code, but then again, shouldn't it be possible for B to use some other completely different implementation? That's encapsulation to me.

Iceland, I believe, did not guarantee its banks' deposits outside of Iceland. Iceland has been able to recover much better than Ireland has. Iceland had no need to placate the business environment for multi-nationals though.</i>""<p>I don't think it was to placate multi-nationals that the banks were guaranteed- it was partly to keep peoples' confidence in the banks (preventing a run on the banks, see this for an explanation of a bank run: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run</a>) and partly to keep investor confidence up so that the banks could continue issuing bonds to investors in London and New York. The first part worked, I can still get cash from an ATM as normal, without fear that my current account will evaporate. The second part, investor confidence, failed spectacularly and now the government is pouring billions into the banks, as is the European Central Bank, which is into the Irish banks for well over a €100bn and no end in sight yet. It's necessary for government intervention because the markets won't touch the banks with a 10-foot barge pole at the moment.<p><a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/21920684-046d-11e0-8a3c-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz17jLupkAC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/21920684-046d-11e0-8a3c-00144feabd...</a><p>The boys in Brussels and Berlin are getting completely fed up with this situation I'd imagine.<p>""<i>I'm interested in knowing your thoughts on Ireland still being part of the Euro. Do you think it's a good idea? Is it a good idea simply because it's good for multi-nationals?</i>""<p>Up until the current recession, I'd have said the euro has been good for Ireland. It's great for tourism, trade, it's very convenient and yes, it's good for multinationals too. It's easy to see how much you're getting screwed buying a meal in Paris, and lowers transaction costs from currency exchanges. However, what we really need now is more control over our fiscal policy, currently impossible due to ceding that power to the ECB - which is mainly concerned with keeping inflation under control in Germany, and keeping the whole Euro project from collapsing. The ECB doesn't really care about Ireland as such (our economy like a tiny bug on the hide of a massive elephant), but they need to keep us afloat due to contractual arrangements and to keep the euro alive. Currently, we really need to devalue our currency, something our government did in 1993, which would make us more attractive to investment and make us more competitive. We also need to keep interest rates low for a long, long time, so homeowners don't start defaulting on their mortgages in massive numbers like the US subprime situation. If the German economy starting picking up as people start buying Mercs and Beemers again, the ECB will hike up interest rates, which will be disastrous for Irish homeowners potentially leading to an even worse situation than we're in now. So it would probably be good for Ireland to not be part of the euro at the moment, but if the world doesn't fall apart and things get better (and the euro doesn't collapse, which is still a very real prospect) then the benefits of the euro will start to outweigh it's disadvantages once again.",1292004074

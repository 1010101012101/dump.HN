Lisps have macros, which are much more fully-featured and more hygienic than C macros, but I don't think any Lisps are fast enough to be interesting to you. I know that the Scala community is working on putting macros in.<p>Have you looked at Ocaml and Scala? Those might be close enough to suit your needs, and I think it's only a matter of time before Scala (or something like it) starts outperforming C++ on parallel problems.<p>What I'll say for C++ is that, in the style of development you're doing, it's definitely faster. The problem I have with C++ is all the use of it that occurs where it's not appropriate and actually makes performance <i>worse</i> because per unit time, programmers can accomplish less in it.<p>It's clearly possible for expert programmers to optimize the hell out of C++ in a way that just doesn't exist in GC languages, but I don't think average-case code is better, especially if it's framed as an <i>economic</i> problem and programmers of equivalent skill are involved and given the exact same amount of time to do it. Under those constraints, for a large problem, I would bet on Ocaml and Scala winning just because the programmers would have more time to spend on optimization. For a small problem, though, I'd bet on C++.",1328475580

I'm sure we can all recall certain teachers that were obviously not concerned for the betterment of their students.  Hell, some are downright hostile.  Then, there are those teachers who really do care- the ones you remember for life.<p>Likewise, technology isn't created equal.  There are some downright terrible online learning courses.<p>The difference between now and a few years ago, is that the education system is finally seeing the value in online technologies to aid in the classroom.<p>Ideally, you have a synergistic effect.  A good teacher aided by a curriculum we can actually track and measure on an individual scale.<p>The students are happy because they can learn at their own pace (or not- you can't win them all over), and the teachers are freed from having a one-size-fits-all solution to a problem that requires a more nuanced approach.<p>What about this is negative?  Are jobs at risk?  Probably.  They have been for a while now, but not because of technology.  Our public schools are just plain underfunded.<p>In the end, technology will actually create MORE jobs- as I said, someone has to design and teach the online courses too.<p>Khan Academy isn't designed to replace teachers, it's designed to aid them in the classroom and free up the time and resources to provide that QUALITY education we all desire so badly for our children.",1328475165

Further, the truth is that smart people are resentful towards this science, because it challenges their views, and that teachers are more likely to be experts in this science than anyone else.<p>Fact: Passive learning techniques aren't especially effective at the kinds of learning that matter most.

I don't see how we can improve it by having uninvested bureaucrats introduce nationalistic biases into the process.<p>> The problem is companies are too cheap to tap into the talent that exists here.<p>Not seeing it. The companies that pay the most and hire the best people regardless of nationality bring in as many foreigners as anyone else.<p>> Bringing in talent from overseas when there are workers here that can do the job (with some training) is in fact a net-negative for the country as a whole. It's not a swap: were not sending away the ""unqualified"" American, the system still has to support him somehow.<p>You're acting like ""training"" has no cost and no risk. You think it's better to take the risk of trying to ""train"" someone, rather than hire someone who already knows what he's doing?

Then you're responsible for the wealth of this country. The color of passport is as irrelevant as the color of your skin.

So, while not versed in the math instructional set du jour at the moment, I have a vested interest in the subject -- my kids in 5th grade.<p>Several parents I know (and respect) have substituted the math instruction their kids are receiving from local schools to using the Khan Academy. While I would never throw my kids into any program without understanding it well ahead of time, I'm reasonably confident that KA would be a helpful addition to my kids' math instruction.<p>I don't claim to understand the best methods for learning math (or teaching it), but for my kids I follow simple results-based assessment with the eye test: do they understand problem sets, can they use math as a tool, are they confident when asked to do math-based exercises, etc. And, yes, do they score well when taking exams. In other words, while I care about the means...I'm really interested in the end.<p>In reading this article, I find someone critical of the KA approach on spurious grounds (very little in this critique is based on fact). That the original author also has a service that sells into the current education system that KA obviously threatens makes the argument that much weaker. I question the motivations of the author, especially with a comment like this:<p>""Of course, fans of Khan Academy  which, to be fair, includes many teachers, parents and administrators  say that their students are engaged and performing better than ever.

Increasingly academics discover their papers via search engines (Google, Google Scholar), and social platforms (blogs, email, arXiv, Academia.edu, Twitter). The usage of these channels as discovery channels for research shows that the metrics that drive those channels are doing a good job at expert curation - i.e. surfacing good content.<p>On Google Scholar, it's citation counts that drive the ranking, and therefore the discovery process. This is the ""crowd review"" process I talked about in the post. With social platforms, it's recommendations from friends and colleagues that drive the discovery process. This is the ""social review"" process I talked about in the post.<p>In the pre-web days, people used to walk down to their libraries to read the latest edition from a particular journal. In those days, the journals did drive a lot of the discovery process. Nowadays, pretty much all discovery of research papers happens on the web, and most of the discovery is via channels such as search, and recommendations from colleagues over social & communication platforms.<p>You are right to think about the incentive systems that drive different kinds of peer review. In the case of the social review process, you want to share good recommendations with your friends, not bad ones (this is why Twitter and Facebook work as discovery channels). In the case of the crowd review process, you want to cite good works that your work genuinely built on, not bad work.",1328474319

I asked to move.<p>In the other bad experience, it wasn't sales, but a bunch of reasonably unruly, not young, but childish developers (edit: could have been a culture/value mismatch, the company was a ""corporate"" supporting a long-lived product, my team coming from start-up environments or preferring them working on a new product).  I managed to get my team moved to another location in the building, and a room for three of us to sit in (facing outward).  (I stole the window seat.)<p>The first good experience with open plan was where our group was together, with a small gap between our group and the next, with some head-height dividers.<p>The second good experience was, I admit, not really open plan.  In a long space, we had pods of 8-12 people with full-height glass walls, with frosting up to just above sitting-head-height.  This was an interesting environment - we mixed support staff (non-phone support), operations staff, developers, designers, and so forth equally between the pods.  (This was at Yola.  Before we moved to new offices, we were in rooms in a house holding 5-7 people in each room.)<p>The best experience has been at Facebook, where I am here.  Especially at our new campus in Menlo Park.  Basically, open plan broken up with small ""lounges"" and curtain-closable rooms, with gaps between groups working on different things.  Plenty of meeting room space, with tons of 2-4 person unreservable rooms, and whiteboards everywhere.<p>There are exceptions.  Like in the old office, there are a few people who need serious quiet/lack of distractions to work, and they work in their own rooms.  Some teams go into ""war rooms"" when they're near release to facilitate even higher-bandwidth discussions.<p>This applies to the bulk of the company, including, for example, the CEO, CTO, VP of Engineering, and VP of Product.<p>Anecdotally, open plan doesn't work at all well when you mix certain job types (sales and engineering, for example), doesn't work as well when you mix people working on different products or without break-out rooms or gaps between groups.  It seems like it can be done well, and it probably needs motivated employees (employees already unhappy are likely to respond more aggressively to distraction).  Some people just don't work well in the environment, and catering to them is a good idea.  Having meeting rooms or collaboration areas located close by, but not distracting to those working, makes people tend to use them to avoid annoying those nearby (have this happen every few days when conversations go over a few minutes, or have more than a few people).",1328473681

But in many scientific fields, there are often only a very small number of people who would be qualified to review a particular paper (usually well under a hundred, sometimes as few as a handful).<p>And make no mistake, this is a numbers game -- there's the well known 100/10/1 rule for content websites (for every 100 viewers, there are 10 who rate content, and only 1 who creates content). The exact numbers vary quite a bit from website to website, but the point is that it's <i>orders of magnitude</i> difference. That's all fine if your initial pool of people is huge, but if you start with 20 qualified people...you see the issue.<p>Another related point not addressed is that peer review is fairly demanding work. You're not just saying ""accept"" or ""reject"", but you're obliged to write a page or two suggesting the strong and weak points of the paper, things to improve, etc. You need some mechanism for enforcing this (even if it's via social norms), otherwise review quality deteriorates quite severely, which in turn affects paper quality.<p>In lieu of this article, I'd recommend seeing lectures by (or essays by) Michael Nielsen, who's thought about this problem in much more detail and (I believe) has a much better understanding of the way things work.<p><a href=""http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/essays/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/essays/</a>",1328473542

But the ""education"" itself is a varied and dynamic system that cannot completely rely on a child to be self-motivated. Few 7 year olds are self-motivated to master math, and gamification is just another arrow in the quiver, but not the panacea. Learning is IMO at least a 2 step process, requiring participation beyond simply multiple choice and listening, it most importantly requires exploration and deep problem solving skills. For example, being assigned a math word problem where the child must read, re-read and attempt to find the answer using at least 30 minutes of analysis before realizing the true nature of the word problem. That 30 minute process is an important mental exercise that cannot be circumvented. KA is a great way to quickly understand a concept, but true mastery requires application, and having a teacher present to gently guide without revealing the answer is an art.<p>Being a parent that closely monitors his child's learning process, I'm very careful to never give my child the answer, but just enough hints to keep him from being frustrated - ultimately, HE must figure it out, never me. KA is a great way for my son to learn about a subject, but the next stage is when I take him away from KA and start applying those concepts to real life problems.<p>Parents need to understand this 2 step process.",1328472815

Note that this can be in high school or college.\nHowever, for those who want to be mathematicians/scientists/engineers/technical people, math education should diverge probably around 7th grade.

Not really news to most French people I think...<p>They are various other factors also, depending on the precise context. For example, in Paris and Petite Couronne most people lives in tiny flats (by American standard and even by French standard in other regions) and you can't afford to let your child make a mess for too long in the living room (or even in their own room) because that would occupy the whole area. So making them tidy up more often mechanically increase discipline. I think that that kind of thing can become cultural and applied even by people who have more space.

3555062,comment,3554940,3554940,4,0,jeffdechambeau,,,"This guy has completely missed the point.<p>Shareholders like high margins. Amazon made some moves last year that depressed their margins, specifically releasing the kindle fire, which they're selling at a loss, and price-beating brick and mortar stores with gift cards over the holidays to lure away customers. These moves have nothing to do with a loss of efficiency in their EGM business, but they do produce the smaller profits we see.<p>What the author mistakenly sees as a loss of efficiency is actually amazon future-proofing their business. Knowing that the market would punish them for taking all this profit and reinvesting it in growth, they went all in and took all the punishment at once.<p>Amazon has bright days ahead.",1328472421

3555054,comment,3554719,3554719,4,0,orblivion,,,"One thing I thought of: I think one way to really make education stronger, and cheaper, by utilizing technology, is to have your ""point system"" based on <i>teaching</i> people just under you. By teaching material, you also learn it more strongly yourself. And of course you have more ""one-on-one"" time with students while actually reducing the demand for professional teachers.<p>So maybe you could start with something like Khan Academy (it doesn't hurt to have the lines, dots, and steps documented somewhere). But then have some sort of social network (and I'm saying this as somebody who thinks that too many things have social networks) based on the ability to learn and teach skills.",1328472318

It also does not obligate me to believe that big companies cannot be improved, even radically improved, by measures which would discomfit at least some people who work for big companies.<p>Indeed, if I hypothetically believed either of those two things prior to working for a big company, working for them would have cured me of those delusions, rapidly.",1328472256

Not an alternative, and certainly not a revolution, but something people of all ages and backgrounds can refer to when needed.  It's a wonderful resource, and this article attempts to diagnose some sort of nonexistent problem with it.  It even seems to back off at the end, as if the author realizes he's done little to identify a problem and less to propose an alternative (or even market his product).<p>Now, if he was going to complain about the ""intuitive"" approach of KA, he might've had something.  Alternatives to KA like PatrickJMT have been successful (to an extent) because some feel that Khan is perhaps a bit too gentle with his teaching method.

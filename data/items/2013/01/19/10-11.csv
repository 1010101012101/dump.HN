We recommend using Jinja2 where you need it, not as a replacement. \n3. PIL on Python 3 is not yet solved. This is part of the reason why the Python web world has not transitioned over completely. It's a huge blocker.\n4. We plan to cover South in depth. In the BETA or FINAL editions of the 1.5 book.\n5. You implement SQLAlchemy in DJango via ""import sqlalchemy"". You do lose lots of goodies (ModelForms, Admin, a bunch of views, etc)\n6. django-social-auth is something we hope to cover before FINAL\n7. On web hosts (webfaction, Heroku, et al), we didn't want to turn the book into a tome about deployment. Each provider does things differently, and we would have to keep track of all that and update when host providers change their services. So rather than describe deployments in depth, we're going to link to their documentation and let them handle it.",1358593193

Depends on whether the instructions are in the I-cache, whether some previous branch prediction has failed, and whether the data are in the cache.

5083089,comment,5079637,5080709,2,0,chetanahuja,,,"It seems that question has almost completely fallen off the radar today. I've experienced medium sized voldemort clusters eating up huge amounts of extra RAM (of the order of 100% overhead[1]) to avoid falling into pathological GC patterns over long runs. Actually I shouldn't really single out voldemort. The problem is java.<p>Java[2] is a terrible platform to write large in-memory caching servers on. The write and access patterns are a complete mismatch for the assumptions made in the generational GC algorithms that most current JVM's sport. Most caches will evict on an LRU basis, which means that almost all allocations will end up in the old generation heap before finally being evicted. Which is precisely the counter-optimal case for the basic assumptions that the generational GC model relies on (that most objects are short-lived and get swept while still in the ""young"" heap (which is ultra cheap).<p>Footnotes:\n[1] ""overhead"" here means precisely how the parent post defines it.\n[2] more precisely, the commonly used freely available JVM's that most shops use. There might be better GC implementations (e.g. as claimed by azul) but I don't have any direct experience with them.",1358592037

5083075,comment,5073439,5077412,2,0,koalalala,,,"Lived in the Midwest for well over a decade. Drove 48 hours straight to GTFO of there with extreme prejudice at the earliest opportunity. There's a few top tier universities, some big transnationals like Monsanto, Boeing, Nestle - you know what great if that's your thing. Personally I didn't ever think ""big money"" was the best reason for living in the midwest while I was there for so long, but I digress.<p>My caustic opinion is if you're not a farmer or self-sufficient type who is thrilled with the opportunity to live <i></i>outside<i></i> of a big city, then try for a city on the coast, like San Francisco. Big midwestern cities just aren't ""all that"" relative to their coastal counterparts. In the midwest you get:<p>- Higher crime rates and corruption<p>- Miserable, MISERABLE prolonged winters<p>- Salted roads --> depresses the value of any enthusiast (Porsche/BMW/Ferrari) type cars you might have on resale<p>- Rampant backwards conservatism<p>- Uncomfortably hot and humid summers<p>- Tornados and severe weather<p>- A severe lack of places to go and things to see<p>After living there for so long, I have a really tough time understanding why you would want to stay there if the opportunity to leave arrived, unless you're involved with a major university or are a farmer / homesteader type person living in the country. Bottom line, if you could magically swap San Francisco with Chicago, social network and assets included at no cost for a day I bet 100% of my money a bunch of Chicagoans would reconsider their whereabouts, and most SFers would be PISSED.<p>Also. And this is important: weed is legal or effectively legal for most of the west coast. This may not be a big deal to you but it's just amazingly energizing to live in an area with sane people who are not brainwashed as opposed to backwards conservatives so prevalent in the midwest. People are healthier and more active here, and I feel many are a bit more open minded. You can call it a negative that the startup scene is unavoidable, but really, isn't fluorishing innovation what you'd <i></i>expect<i></i> to see in any super happening big city? If you don't want to see innovation, maybe city life isn't for you, maybe dairy farming is for you.<p>just my 2c :0 plz dont hate me",1358591237

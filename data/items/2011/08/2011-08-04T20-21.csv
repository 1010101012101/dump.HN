It has been to put up barriers to adding content, making anyone who starts a new article go though more and more bureaucracy, paperwork and proving your innocence. It is the same with uploading pictures or just adding text to an article. This has led to much fewer people joining the community, and without enough editors to look after the articles, the arguments to lock down and protect only becomes stronger.<p>Basically Wikipedia has suffered the same fate as many mature online communities. In the beginning everyone is helping each other out and you are creating something great together. After a few years the older members of the community start getting really tired of the clueless newcomers and start complaining and setting up rules. New users no longer feel welcome and never stay long. Soon 90% are experienced members, and the newcomer perspective is lost completely. It is often not intentional, making it easier for moderators is just higher priority than letting more people participate.<p>I wonder if Stack Overflow will survive growing up.",1312491359

I'm currently reading an interesting history of the 90s riot grrl movement (Sara Marcus's <i>Girls to the Front</i>), and from what I can tell, publishing zines was a big part of what helped them develop a community, find friends/bandmates, hone philosophies and possible lyrical ideas, etc. In fact a few of the bands existed only in concept until they got put on the spot by someone who liked their zine enough to book them to play a gig! (Then they had to finish learning to play instruments and write some songs.)<p>In part I think that's because some kinds of publishing, like zines and social media, are somewhat in between pure publishing and conversation; they're not just a polished finished product, but also a way to discuss ideas and meet people.",1312490510

For low-interest topics, Wikipedia eventually succeeds anyway because less-motivated contributors become bored or exhausted and stop arguing.  For high-interest topics, the search for consensus becomes more and more explicitly political - political as in ""determining the governing rules of a body of disparate people"", rather than political as in ""are Republicans better than Democrats"", although the two kinds of 'political' are both present in many edit wars.<p>Take the cool-off rules, for examples - locking an article for a period of time, or forbidding certain people from editing it.  This is central to Wikipedia's functioning in highly controversial areas, but ""nobody can edit this article today"" is a policy, not a datapoint.  Politics produces policy - a set of actions that can be acted upon by people who do NOT necessarily agree about the underlying facts.<p>Nasty edit-wars borrow from the tools of dictatorship and oppression - censorship, propaganda, exclusion from the body politic.  It's not a coincidence; as mentioned above, consensus is incompatible with individual rights.  You need to limit which individuals are allowed to participate, or negotiate the ways that their participation will be accepted.  In a sufficiently small or like-minded group, consensus can work again.<p>A data server has a failure state where some of the data is lost.  Wikipedia's failure state, on the other hand, resembles the internal rupture of a political party in a post-Soviet state.  Like communist countries, Wikipedia articles demand consensus from their citizens in order to operate.<p>Of course, unlike Eastern Bloc revolutions, Wikipedia contributors typically do not get lined up against a wall and shot. =) That's also one of the reasons we tend to put Wikipedia edit wars in either the ""tech company struggles with its architecture"" bucket or the ""people on the Internet are angry, news at 7"" bucket, rather than the ""fractured political unit experiences internal strife due to irreconcilable demands on limited resources"" bucket where they actually belong.",1312489767

A tip for Google, the truth works better, even if it requires a few more sentences to tell it.<p>On the actual merits though, Google seems to be completely lost in the world of IP tactics.  They should have worked to remove all of these patents off the table as cheaply as possible.  The available cash that MS+Apple simply dwarfs what Google has.  Head to head, if MS+Apple want the patents they'll win them.  Trying to win them outright as defensive patents was a stupid attempt.<p>The fact that their current IP strategy seems to be to buy IP is absurd.  Google really needs to start producing significant IP in the mobile space.  Their current IP strategy is naive, and likely costly.  The fact that they didn't think about this three years ago, when Jobs was on stage talking about patenting everything, up and down, is a firing offense, IMO.",1312489736

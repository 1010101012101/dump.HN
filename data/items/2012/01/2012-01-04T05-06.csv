This author doesn't like that he hears from a lot of people he doesn't talk to much, and to me, that kind of means that yes, I have my friends I interact with often, but I also have facebook to bring me closer to the people who may just not be in that inner circle yet. I wouldn't have the time or energy to pursue those relationships on my own and facebook makes it much easier. That may sound unnatural, but if we were using computers to accomplish only what we would be accomplishing without them, then why compute? Facebook is better at keeping up with my acquaintances and friends than I am, and that's why I use it. That doesn't make my real life social network any less important.<p>As for the privacy stuff, I don't know much about data mining, but I do know that there seems to be an interesting relationship between total data and what can be done on a person scale when it comes to privacy invasion by giant companies. As the information collected becomes more intricate, more data is required, i.e. every visited page with a like button on it ever, and the data becomes increasingly difficult to mine. I don't like the idea of a single person poking around my internet history, but then I remember that unless I were a felon, I just don't see facebook having the resources for that to happen (not that they absolutely couldn't, but that they couldn't target ME, one in 500 million, without targeting a large group that I am a part of, say, the state of new york, which would be a very difficult task. This is a question of probabilistic capability, not absolute capability.). Maybe I'm wrong, let me know if I am. This could be an important lesson in online privacy for me.",1325655762

Arguing that they had any sort of reasonable belief that it was a counterfeit would last about five seconds in a small claims court.<p>(b) Paypal's terms are probably irrelevant here anyway unless they owned either the money or the instrument. If they don't have a valid legal claim on them, then they have no right to tell anyone else what to do with them, regardless of any document their lawyers write.<p>(c) Even if the terms are relevant, this policy is so obviously unreasonable that you can't assume any court is going to automatically uphold the contractual term.<p>(d) This is all to protect Paypal, not the buyer. Notwithstanding any of Paypal's legalese, and obviously without knowing all the details, it seems very possible that a court would hold that a contract of sale existed here between the buyer and seller directly, and that as such the buyer who destroyed the instrument but did not pay for it is either in breach of contract (and thus owes the money anyway) or guilty of theft/criminal damage/other similar offences (in which case they are potentially in bigger trouble and might actually have police showing up on their doorstep, though even in the best case for them if the violin was as specified then they have conveniently accepted what a valid level of compensation would be).<p>(e) The fact that the destruction was done at Paypal's request is probably irrelevant following such a finding, other than to the extent that Paypal may have some sort of indirect liability for the damages in a civil suit, or that whichever idiot working for them sent the request might even be regarded as an accessory to a crime if someone in authority wanted to make a point. Actually, I imagine that would shake their staff down pretty quickly, since no amount of contractual anything from Paypal's legal team is going to protect the staff personally in that sort of situation.<p>Standard disclaimers apply: I'm not a lawyer, but I have found that if you actually get your day in court then usually the court has some amount of common sense and a much smaller amount of tolerance for lawyers obviously trying to intimidate other citizens with legalese. Internet tough-guy defences pointing at tricky legalese don't always end well, if the Internet tough-guy law suit actually reaches a court room. It's usually the cost/inconvenience/lack of understanding of bringing a small-scale lawsuit that protects the companies from wronged individuals, not the power of their obviously one-sided form contracts.",1325654774

Just make sure the domain reggie doesn't point back at you.<p>You only buy links so that it appears like you've got an organic link farm instead of a mass produced one. Remember only Google is allowed to sell links, cuz they put them in a slightly yellow box or something. If other people could get you to the front page of google it would undermine Google's business model.",1325653871

Though if requiring TLS I wonder why not just use basic auth since it's simpler and since TLS would protect the password.<p>One of the things that's neat about, say, OAuth's MAC authentication, is that it works over plain old HTTP without TLS. Likewise for the AWS API's signature-based security scheme. Sounds like I erroneously assumed that this was aiming to do similarly.",1325653866

The people making the product make a profit (noe of which goes to cancer research); the people selling the product make a profit (none of which goes to cancer research); so really it's only 50% of the affiliate fees that go to cancer research, right?<p>3) the mix of different colours is weird and jarring.

3158836,comment,3157119,3158767,1,0,Udo,,,"Not necessarily:<p>Replication is basically just a provision for instant failover. Let's say that by policy the background data store (e.g. MySQL) always has a copy that is at most 10 minutes old. In practice it could probably be much more recent. So in general user data is safe but you want something very simple to prevent data loss and service disruption in the most common failure scenarios.<p>I believe the best paradigm is a replication buddy system between two given Nodes. Should a Node instance fail, the app can always issue the same request to its ""replication buddy"" and expect to get the same data. Implementing a replication buddy relationship between two instances should be relatively easy using a persistent connection between them, since Node is all non-blocking but still guaranteed sequentially executed code (=there will be no real consistency problem). Nodes could just notify each other when data changes in the background and they'd both always have the same data state. Granted, there would have to be some code to take care of what happens in different failure modes (probably the most complex aspect of the whole thing), but overall still very doable.<p>Scaling would be even easier: just put user IDs into different buckets, each bucket is a replicated instance. If this is even necessary.<p>And the beauty of it is that you have to implement this just once, no matter how many different server-side apps and languages you use. It would be a common piece of infrastructure.",1319641037

3158828,comment,3156738,3158373,2,0,Derbasti,,,"Lets compare this to airplanes. Air travel used to be limited to those who were able and crazy enough to actually fly planes themselves. Now everyone can use planes for transportation in a very mediated and controlled environment. A pilot flying in an airliner is very much like a programmer using an iPhone: Other engineers did all the hard work and the net result is something somewhat boring and limiting (a commercial airliner will only fly to certain destinations). On the other hand it is also very safe and comparatively cheap. Now flying an aircraft on your own is amazingly fun and an exhilarating experience. But it is also very expensive, quite complicated and somewhat dangerous.<p>Now the point is, I am both a programmer and a pilot myself. So I can definitely see the appeal of both. But, I happily use an iPhone and commercial air travel. Other people have put in a lot of work to made these very safe and reliable for common purposes and they really work well for crossing the atlantic while listening to a podcast.<p>The iPhone is not denying anyone access to laptops any more than an Airbus is denying you access to a Cessna.

Get a dozen sharp programmers together, give them all a hard problem to work on, and a bunch of them will come up with solutions that would probably be patentable, and be similar enough that the first programmer to file the patent could sue the others for patent infringement.<p>Why should society reward that? What benefit does it bring? It doesn't help bring more, better, or cheaper products to market. Those all come from competition, not arbitrary monopolies. The programmer that filed the patent didn't work any harder because a patent might be available, solving the problem was his job and he had to do it anyway. Getting a patent is uncorrelated to any positive attributes, and just serves to allow either money or wasted effort to be extorted from generally unsuspecting and innocent people or companies.<p>Yes, it is a legal tool that may help you against your competitors, but I'll have no part of it.

Patents were part of a program of reform that in part led to the industrial revolution. If instead of patenting the early steam engine designs each inventor had formed a secretive guild, worked in isolation, and produced intentionally convoluted designs, where would we be now?<p>Patents are a lottery system that rewards some inventors for publishing their designs, but has the effect of encouraging everyone to publish their designs in the hope of winning the lottery.<p>The problem with our IP law is that it is maladapted for the information age. Copyright, in particular, is the wrong kind of protection for software (which is machinery) especially since it is used to protect binaries and not source code (which is instead kept secret, meaning that copyright has the negative impact of creating monopolies without the offsetting positive impact of creating public goods).<p>Patents would be almost perfect for software if the patent required provision of working source code -- the ridiculous language of patent law exists because expressing the precise workings of machinery in words is difficult -- not so with software.<p>If software patents included source code, it would accomplish the goal of patents (making public goods) and make identifying infringement less arbitrary (and probably even establish stronger arguments for obviousness and prior art).

The details of this would be abstracted away from the application code itself, because the app just issues read and write requests on a user's dataset. So in essence, by splitting up the problem in two, it becomes relatively easy to handle (and optimize) on each end.<p>(2) You just have to keep the <i>active</i> datasets wired in RAM and it wouldn't be necessary for the Node server to know whether a user has disconnected recently or not. All it knows is when the data was last accessed and it can then vacate RAM slots that have become stale. Compare this to Redis, which I believe just keeps everything in memory no matter what. So overall RAM usage would probably be considerably less than what you're doing now.<p>(3) The idea beats ""dumb blob caching"" such as memcache, because it makes small operations economical. It seems to me that Node is well suited for this kind of task since it makes it very easy to build small server scripts that handle a huge number of small transactions. This would probably mean you need less machines for the same amount of users.<p>(4) I believe it's relatively easy to implement replication and scaling.<p>Anyway, just an idea. I have no clue whether this works in practice ;-)",1319639345

When the show began, that didn't seem to be the case: It seemed like this was going to be the story of a man (Walter White, portrayed by Bryan Cranston) forced to become a criminal because he was dying of cancer. That's the elevator pitch. But that's completely unrelated to what the show has become. The central question on Breaking Bad is this: What makes a man ""bad"" - his actions, his motives, or his conscious decision to be a bad person? Judging from the trajectory of its first three seasons, Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan believes the answer is option No. 3. So what we see in Breaking Bad is a person who started as one type of human and decides to become something different. And because this is television - because we were introduced to this man in a way that made him impossible to dislike, and because we experience TV through whichever character we understand the most - the audience is placed in the curious position of continuing to root for an individual who's no longer good.""<p>I've only seen the first few episodes, but am hoping to find some time to go through it now.  I get plenty of morality from shows like ""Mad Men"" and ""The Wire"" in which we feel conflicted because the characters we love are doing bad things (in fact you could say that this is the main theme of serious, dramatic TV shows now), but I think the appeal of ""Breaking Bad"" is watching a desperate man make the conscious decision to become ""evil.""",1319639302

3158649,comment,3158318,3158318,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"Lord Acton said to judge talent at its best and character at its worst. Large human organizations tend to judge both at their worst, and to be negative on unknown people for a longer time than any single rational actor would be, which is why ""dues paying"" periods are so ridiculously long. What this means is that the people who get ahead are people who can sustain a middling performance over a long time without even a whiff of failure, and not the creative, passionate people who take a lot of risks and can hit the high notes but occasionally screw up.<p>There are high-variance (passionate) and low-variance (professional) people, and various gradations in between. HV tend to swing (in work performance) between 2 and 10, while LV tend to swing between 5 and 7. If you're HV, it means you learn quickly and can do great things but it's also a statistical near-guarantee that you'll be fired at least once in your career (don't worry; in the long term, it's not as big a deal as you think it is).<p>Game development on AAA titles is no different. Don't go into it thinking a high level of creative talent will launch you into a position of major influence. You may or may not have creative talent, but not only do you have to prove it first, but you have to get into a position where you <i>can</i> prove it-- and the latter is much harder, because the only people who can get on projects where creativity is visible are those who've already put a lot into the political bank.<p>Passionate people look at the garbage games typical of the industry and think, ""I could do so much better!"" And they're 100% correct. That also doesn't matter.<p>My advice (which is so cliche): forget about games, except as a hobby and possibly something to study. Play them and build independent games if you wish, but consider ""game design"" a non-option without one hell of a lift. Learn how to program. Programming opens up a lot of problems that are fun in their own right even if you're <i>not</i> working on games. A lot of programming problems are <i>far</i> more interesting than running 8-figure video games; trust me on this. Become a really great programmer. That will pay off regardless of whether one ever goes into the video game industry. And becoming a top-1% programmer (takes 10+ years, start now) will make entry into the game industry at a decent level (for a passionate person unwilling to pay dues for decades) possible.",1319638796

3158593,comment,3156304,3156304,1,0,chris_dcosta,,,"Seller financed is one of the oldest tricks in the book. It means you (the seller) pay yourself for the sale from the proceeds of any furture profits. There are a couple of other red flags in what you wrote above, like time pressure (always a bad sign) and ""the ratchet"". Of course you may be informed and able to speculate, but there's nothing better than getting yourself a very good legal firm. Good ones are very honest about the downsides to any situation, which is what you need. Nothing is worse than being told everything is fine only to find out later that there were foreseeable issues.<p>You should go into this with a take-it-or-leave-it approach and call the shots so that it's what you want, and not what they want to give you. But you'll have to get a standard position from everyone of your partners, and the only way to do that is to say NO to dealing with individuals. The reason is divide and conquer. That's another thing they'll do.<p>Also DO YOUR RESEARCH. Who are the buyers? Can they give you personal guarantees to pay you even if what they're doing does not work out? Who is this mysterious competitor? Why didn't you know about them when you started your project? Again good lawyers will help you out here.<p>So form a company, set your equity, get the best legal advice there is, and do not have multiple positions on your side when you go into negotiations. Be prepared to walk when you don't get what you want.",1319637999

3158578,comment,3155052,3155052,5,0,sdfjkl,,,"In the olden days, pirating was hard. Hard to get the pirated game, hard to install the crack, hard to get it working again when a new patch came out and often the cracks didn't quite work and you had to find another one in the middle of your playthrough or even restart from the beginning because it broke something in your savegame. Just buying the game meant installing and playing, no hassle.<p>Today, installing a game you bought is harder than pirating it. You have to activate it, type in a 25 digit code you found on the box (wait, is that a B or a 3? Damnit.). It'll need an internet connection to activate, but the activation server is usually overloaded and doesn't work on launch day. Then it wants to patch itself before letting you play, because the stuff you got on the DVD you bought is actually out of date by the time you get home. You also have to sign up for some stupid web service that you never wanted, and have another login and password that you must not forget (or else you can't play anymore and your savegames are gone with it). Except if it's GFWL (Microsoft's Games for Windows Live). Then you also have to figure out why that damn thing gets stuck in an update loop and makes you log into things just to play an entirely offline, single player game (then you have to install xliveless, which avoids that). Pirating is so much easier. You torrent the thing, unpack it and play, just the way it should be.<p>I'm glad Gabe Newell gets this, and it's apparent in Valve's Steam (except for some reason they permit GFWL infested games, but at least they warn you about it).",1319637764

Fair point, but CPAN authors aren't looking for tutorials, nor are they writing tutorials (otherwise, they'd be tutorial authors, not CPAN authors).<p>The original point was that googling for tutorials brings up old crappy code.  What modern perl experts write has no bearing on this issue.<p>What's needed is an concerted effort to have those talented CPAN authors focus their efforts on writing modern tutorials, publicizing them, getting linked, and also contacting owners of older tutorials and asking them to link to the modern stuff.<p>It won't happen overnight, but there's a cyclical downward spiral with perl that needs to be stopped.  People looking at old/bad perl tutorials may never get to the point where they even learn about or use CPAN in the first place, and won't get exposed to better techniques.  Many tutorials in other languages are bad, of course, but compare a bad PHP tutorial to a bad perl one, and the PHP will still be easier for newbs to grok.",1319637658

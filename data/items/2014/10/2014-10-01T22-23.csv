8398364,comment,8394381,8397837,1,0,jamii,,,"Scoping is basically a way of mapping human-readable names to uniquely addressed code objects. When I say &quot;foo&quot; the compiler walks up the lexical scope until it finds a declaration for a variable called &quot;foo&quot; and replaces the human-readable name with the corresponding unique id.<p>Instead of having a set of rules to map the human-readable names, we generate unique ids for everything at edit time and tag them with the human-readable name. So when you type &quot;foo&quot;, you get an intelligently sorted auto-complete box asking you which foo you mean.<p>This is one of the advantages of not directly editing the program text - we can insert all kinds of useful metadata directly into the AST.<p>> ...they make it easy for non-programmers to start with something, and add complexity to it until not only they can&#x27;t maintain it...<p>Like most things, the problem can&#x27;t be solved with technology alone. We can improve the tools to make it easier to organise code and to make it easier to understand other peoples code but we will also have to find ways to scale up the teaching aspect. It&#x27;s the &#x27;pit of success&#x27; - we have to design the experience so that people naturally end up doing the right thing. That includes building a community where people learn from each other and are exposed to better ways of structuring their thoughts.",1412204367

8398362,comment,8394784,8396055,2,0,sitkack,,,"Similarly, one can use the compiler as a CASE [0] tool and write in a HLL using the compiler and optimizer to generate assembly which can then be modified by the programmer. There are many instructions that the compiler won&#x27;t use that can lead to speedups.<p>I used the above technique for some bit rotation code years ago, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do it in C, so I wrote the function signature, dumped the whole thing to assembly using the compiler, removed the function body with my own routine which was trivial to write in assembler.<p>It would be interesting to have an application for this, that could be called as part of an optimizing build step:<p>* given a set of compilers (gcc,clang,icc,open64)\n* project the source to assembler as various optimization levels\n* benchmark all of them using supplied data\n* give a side by side view of the fastest assembly and HLL code\n* programmer optimizes assembly, does a benchmark test with historical runs tests for correctness and speed<p>The tool would be a combo text editor, historical benchmark and compiler driver. This feedback loop step could be broadcast on a website for lots of organic agents to optimize... ;)<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_engineering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_enginee...</a>",1412204331

I have some direct experience here as I was in contact with a number of &quot;searchers&quot; earlier in the year (word about my business, which is retail/consumer focused, made its way around what I learned is a pretty tight-knit network.)<p>The model works as such:  The searchers are typically recent MBA grads and sponsored by a group of backers (who, in many cases, are the actual professors & their network).  The searchers have less power than you (or they) think -- their job is to find, interview, dig in and model out a business -- and then present it to their investment partners, who are the ones who actually make the investment decision (not entirely unlike angel investing cohorts).<p>Risk-averse is spot on -- they&#x27;re looking for a _very_ specific type of business (TFA doesn&#x27;t cover it exactly):  They want safe straightforward B2B operations with an intense focus on recurring revenue.  That&#x27;s the phrase I kept hearing over and over - &quot;locked-in recurring revenue.&quot;  The idea is that the searcher can jump in at the helm and not worry about rocking the boat while he/she gets up to speed.<p>The particularly risk averse ones (especially those that have been searching - unsuccessfully - for 2+ years) are looking for a different type of &quot;unicorn&quot;.  They want businesses - like Asurion - with massive growth potential and iron-clad (i.e. low churn) long-term recurring revenue from other businesses.  Don&#x27;t we all ;)<p>Most of the targets are businesses that are all around us but that we techies probably haven&#x27;t heard of -- things like oil services companies with contracts to transport crude from ports to refinery.  Or commercial janitorial companies with 10-year contracts to service all properties in some real estate management company&#x27;s portfolio.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting niche of the investment world, for sure.",1412203875

Deliberate practice for software development would be more like doing the hardest Project Euler problems in very constrained environments.<p>-----<p>Personally, I think it is very, very dubious that there are significant genetic components in virtually any activity. While having a relative that is good at chess might bias your probability towards being good at chess, this is not evidence that people without relatives who are good at chess will be bad at chess. The human genome is ludicrously small compared to the space of human activities. It simply cannot encode the skills necessary to be a pilot, to be a chessmaster, to be a doctor, a lawyer, a software designer, a lover, a fighter, or even a small, tiny fraction of the things humans do every single day.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible that there is some cognitive process, like pattern recognition, that the Polgars were genetically predisposed to being good at. But since there are so few cognitive processes and so many skills, it&#x27;s likely that there are huge swaths of talents that the Polgars would also be predisposed to as well as playing chess.<p>That&#x27;s not even taking into account neuroplasticity, which we now know to be far more prevalent than we previously thought. Only decades ago it was thought that brains only deteriorate after a certain age. We know that to be false now. Beyond even that, technology is only going to become better, and we are very close (certainly on the timescale of humanity&#x27;s existence) to true intelligence amplification on a biological level.<p>Further, the best way to find out if you&#x27;re good at a thing is to do it. Self-fulfilling prophecies being what they are, it&#x27;s best if you think you&#x27;ll succeed going in, because otherwise you&#x27;re literally sabotaging yourself. I think this is handled better by Cal Newport than by myself and I advise you to read his book <i>So Good They Can&#x27;t Ignore You</i> for that handling.<p>-----<p>Ultimately, at some point in this discussion, you need to decide whether we live in the world of <i>Limitless</i>, or in the world of <i>Gattaca</i>. Either you spread the meme, whether it&#x27;s literally true or not, that humans can accomplish anything, or you spread the meme that there are a handful of things <i>you</i> can do, and your only hope in happiness lies in finding those things and doing them.<p>Obviously I think it&#x27;s better to live in the Limitless-world than the Gattaca-world. While I think that Gattaca is a woefully misinformed parody of genetic engineering on humans, it does a very good job of portraying a society where everybody thinks that they live in a caste and that&#x27;s the end all and be all of their world.<p>If humanity had decided it was good at endurance hunting and gathering, we would still be on the Savannah. The story of humanity is the story of rejecting that there is a set list of things one can do, and doing things that are utterly impossible. Humans are the only thing we know of that can do this. If we abandon this, as far as we are aware, that light is snuffed out for the whole universe.<p>Until we know that is not the case, we need to be conservative, and guard that ingenuity with the utmost caution.",1412203530

The FiOS is an MDU, so instead of fiber to each apartment we get fiber to an ONT on each floor, and VDSL to each unit. Still, it&#x27;s rock solid 45/15 all times of day for $50/month.<p>The other day, I lost internet. Called Verizon, they said it must be a problem with my unit because nobody else in the building had complained. Verizon tech comes out, and realizes that the reason nobody has complained is that I&#x27;m the only one on the ONT. Indeed, the ONT wasn&#x27;t even properly configured with the network, and nobody had noticed because I was the first person on the floor to subscribe to the service since the building was built in 2011. We&#x27;re talking about a building with dozens of apartments on each floor, by the way.<p>The moral of the story is that people care about their internet connection a lot less than folks on HN would like to believe. Verizon is still pushing hard to recoup its investment in FiOS, because customers aren&#x27;t willing to pay what it costs to build all that infrastructure.

And we hope we will find that thing for us. And that it will be cool.<p>And yet with 7 billion of us, we shall have to niche down <i>a lot</i> to get good.  To be in the top 1000 globally, we will have to choose between 7 million skill sets.  And with only 27,000 of job types in Soc2010 ( for example &quot;\n9244 Warden, patrol, crossing, school&quot;) I think we are going to have some problems.<p>Look at athletics.  Here genetics plays an enormous part (Usain Bolt was born to excel at sport) but deliberate practise also makes him fast.  Yet there are millions of people each year who complete intensive running regiemes, either for formal marathons or just as &quot;jogging&quot;.<p>These people achieve &quot;mastery&quot; of running - improved aerobic fitness, stretched and improved muscles, an understanding of race conditions, of weather and environment, awareness of traffic, a better understanding of their own body as well.  I have experienced all these things as runner and cyclist.<p>I am not &quot;world class&quot;.  But I am easily beyond merely competent in cycling.<p>And so I think we are setting the wrong goals.  10,000 hours of deliberate practise sounds too pat too simplistic, but the idea that you can be world class in anything without years of practise is almost oxymoronic.<p>So is &quot;world class&quot; what we mean by &quot;mastery of a skill&quot;? Perhaps we would be better off with &quot;beyond competent&quot;. The multiplication of genes and practise is a powerful formula - but to be the very best is a near psychotic desire. To be in the peloton is a good aim - but I simply think completing the course without shame is a skill we can all learn with practise and one to be proud of.",1412203318

8398201,comment,8396356,8396356,1,0,geebee,,,"As someone who attended UC campuses for both undergrad and grad, I do have a strong innate sympathy for large public research institutions.  I think that the methodology used by the very influential US News rankings rewards keeping the undergraduate student body small, with relatively few low income students, and penalizes universities for doing the opposite.  Almost everything about staying small with lots of money (and fewer low income students) bumps up your numbers.  Lower admissions rate, higher SAT scores, better graduation rates.  It&#x27;s all a positive, and there&#x27;s no penalty for being small and affluent, so why not?<p>So taking a step back and looking at it as a student, it&#x27;s an easy call - especially when these elite schools are offering lots of financial aid.  If you&#x27;re high income, tuition doesn&#x27;t matter.  If you&#x27;re low income, you&#x27;ll get great financial aid, often better than you would have gotten at a state school.<p>You&#x27;ll also get more support.  You&#x27;re much less likely to get kicked out of an &quot;impacted&quot; major (these things don&#x27;t really exist at elite schools, but people sure do get kicked out of their preferred major at state schools).  You&#x27;re more likely to graduate.  Professors and staff aren&#x27;t trying to accommodate a student body 5 times (or more) the size of a private, so the access is better, less harried.  As a grad student at Cal, I heard a bit about Stanford &quot;coddling&quot;, and I don&#x27;t buy it.  Supporting a promising student in  her quest to major in engineering rather than kicking her out because she got a B- in physics and calculus her first semester in college isn&#x27;t coddling, it&#x27;s doing right by your students and is perfectly compatible with high standards.  The opposite is, in my opinion, an outrageous waste of talent.  Hey, I said I&#x27;m sympathetic to UCs but I don&#x27;t like everything about them.<p>The only real downside I can see here is that you might not quite understand what&#x27;s happening out there to higher education.  At UCSD, I met a young woman who had to give up on college because her father was claiming her as a dependent, it was messing up her financial aid, and she just needed to work a while.  I knew a guy who was trying to major in computer science while paying the rent with a part time job at Nordstrom.  And that&#x27;s at UCSD, a relatively well off and &quot;elite&quot; public!  I wouldn&#x27;t want our future leaders to be too insulated from this kind of thing.  I actually do think the best leaders for the future probably should be coming from top public research universities rather than elite privates.<p>The washington monthly college rankings (and explanation of methodology) were really eye-opening.  They asked &quot;what have you done for us lately&quot; - the idea being that if universities are going to receive massive amounts of federal research support (privates get a ton of government support) and enjoy a tax-exempt status, we should be asking what they do for everyone, rather than only those who are able to attend them. I&#x27;d recommend reading it for yourself, but generally speaking, they looked at public service (including military service), research output especially in science and engineering, and contribution to social mobility (percentage of low income students).  They didn&#x27;t consider sheer scale, though I think they should - if you can do this for 25,000 undergrads rather than just 5,000 on the same budget, shouldn&#x27;t that also be considered a positive quality?<p>By this standard, ivies (according to wash monthly) do appear to be overrated (though interestingly, Stanford still scores very high).  They generally don&#x27;t produce the same quantity and quality of research in science and engineering that you see out of elite publics, they don&#x27;t enroll very many students, and they especially don&#x27;t enroll very may low income students (though those they do enroll are treated very generously).<p>UCs and other elite state schools, on the other hand, rise dramatically to the top.<p>So are &quot;ivies&quot; overrated?  Well, depends on whether you get to attend one.  If you&#x27;re outside the wall, asking what universities are contributing the most to the general welfare, UCLA is probably a lot more valuable than an ivy.  But if you get in?  Well, you might want to seriously consider going to that ivy.",1412202457

He started from no experience with golf, and is working his way through the game pretty systematically.<p>He may not make the pro tour by the time the 10,000 hours are up, but he&#x27;s definitely increased his mastery of the game pretty significantly over 5,000 hours of practice.<p>I&#x27;m a little unclear about your anecdote; you&#x27;re saying that even with incredible amounts of focused practice, some people will never be good at some things, and then as evidence you say that you never really put in that much effort learning how to draw, but you could tell that you would never be any good.

But, hopefully, with a bit more knowledge you&#x27;ll begin to get it and understand why it matters, and can genuinely put people in danger.<p>There are <i>many</i> parts of the world, including in the United States, where hate crimes against transgendered people are common. This includes cities that we like to think of as progressive and gay friendly. Trans people have been beaten, and even murdered, simply for being trans. So, to be trans in the US, and in many other places, is to live in fear that the wrong person will discover your identity, where you live, etc.<p>Further, drag personas may very well be the primary social identity of a person. Their friends know them by this name and identity, and may not know of any other. But, when they go to work, go shopping, etc., they may have very different persona that they keep separate from their social identity for their own safety and well-being. People can still lose their jobs for being trans. Trans people can be, and often are, treated very poorly by medical practitioners (particularly poor folks who have fewer options for their medical care). Trans people can be treated very poorly by the legal system in child custody cases. Likewise, trans people arrested for crimes often receive stiffer sentences than non-trans folks, and may experience discrimination and humiliation in the prison system. It is dangerous, on so many levels, to be openly trans.<p>Transgender is recognized to be a real thing, and not a &quot;disorder&quot;, by every major psychological and medical organization in the developed world. But, the popular opinion has not caught up with the science. And, so people who are trans have significant hurdles to leading a happy life free of being bullied, preyed upon, and generally having a lot more challenges than folks who identify as the sex of the body they were born with.<p>In short, saying, &quot;Setup a business page for that persona or whatever.&quot; ignores the reality that trans people live with every day. Revealing that one is trans to the world at large dramatically increases the risk of being trans.<p>It sucks that our world and society is this way. Someone should be able to dress up fancy on a Saturday night, without fear of being beaten for it, fired from their job, risk losing custody of children, or be denied appropriate medical care. But, we don&#x27;t live in a world where that&#x27;s true. Those are the realities of being one of the most hated minorities.<p>Facebook&#x27;s policy made it harder for trans people to exist in peace. So, the apology is warranted, and the clarification of the policy is useful. Though, I think it probably doesn&#x27;t go far enough. And, I think their reasons for being so insistent have as much to do with the value of knowing someone&#x27;s legal identity, as it does with their assertion that it is the &quot;primary mechanism we have to protect millions of people every day, all around the world, from real harm.&quot;",1412202050

All data lives in tables. Views are built using relational queries and update incrementally when data changes. IO is done by watchers that react to data arriving in certain tables. The only link to Smalltalk is the idea of running the program inside the development environment so the tools can all access live data.",1412201089

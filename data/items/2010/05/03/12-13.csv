Sometimes we can communicate with very little language simply because we know what the purpose of the interaction is.<p>Another thing I keep wondering about is why so little emphasis is put on dialog. When humans don't understand something, they ask, or offer an interpretation and ask whether it's the right one.<p>Speech recognition systems don't seem to do that. They say ""Sorry, I could not understand what you said. Please repeat"". That's not very helpful for the computer of course. It should say: ""Huh, Peas?

I was born and brought up in India and went to a boarding school at age 10. I will give people the benefit of the doubt initially but I will not fully trust them till they've proven themselves, usually by their actions not words.<p>> 3) I either delegate too much or too little<p>Proper delegation is easy when all you have are managerial/people-skills. You delegate to the best coders, artists, and accountants that you can afford. But when you consider yourself as a viable candidate for a task that can be delegated, you end up with the ""I should have done it myself"" half the times. On the other hand, a manager with no-tech/domain-specific skills would think ""I should have picked a better person."" Over time, the manager gets better and better at finding the right people to delegate the task to, whereas you don't. Meanwhile, you get more and more prone to either doing it yourself completely or not doing it at all and completely relying on someone to do it all.<p>My advice to anyone who fits this bill (as do I), next time you think ""I should have done it myself"", stop yourself and instead ask ""What could I have done differently to help someone finish this task better?""",1272890835

1314625,comment,1314572,1314593,0,0,_delirium,,,"I don't think tying claims need to prove an actual monopoly, just the somewhat lower standard that the seller has sufficient market power in the tying product's market for the tying arrangement to restrain trade in the tied product's market. It's been applied in the past to car manufacturers who tried to corner their own cars' replacement-parts market, even though the manufacturers didn't actually have a monopoly in the car market.<p>It's hard to prove, though, because it tends to require showing that the company did the tying solely or mainly for the purpose of restraining trade, as opposed to for some legitimate purpose. The car manufacturers lost because the courts didn't buy their argument that their attempts to limit the replacement-parts market were for quality-assurance reasons. Apple would have to argue that section 3.3.1 isn't intended mainly or solely to stop cross-platform compatibility, but has some legitimate, non-trade-restraining purpose, like improving the reliability or quality of iPhone apps. Probably even just ""it makes it easier for us to review apps if they're all in the same languages"" would be a good enough explanation. A bad result would be a leaked smoking-gun email saying ""hey we should institute this policy to stop people from porting our apps to Android"".<p>Monopoly leveraging is a separate (but related) concept, as far as I understand it, and a bit easier to prove, because there's a much stronger presumption that if it's happening, it's bad, regardless of the reasons.<p>(Edit: edited/expanded a bit for clarity)",1272890534

So, for better or worse, I take a lesson from that which is to be empiricist: look closely at each field to see whether it's vaulting forward or not.<p>It's not happening in space (although hypersonics seem to be getting more real). It's not happening in AI or speech recognition/understanding. It's not happening in medicine.<p>So the <i>net</i> empirical situation looks like the opposite of what Kurzweil says. Only IT and Moore's Law are going totally nuts.

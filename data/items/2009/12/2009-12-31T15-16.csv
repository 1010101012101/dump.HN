Basically, those 18-24 who are looking for a job are those who wouldn't stay in school, not those who couldn't afford like in the US or even the UK. Not exactly surprisingly, they are not all prime recruiting material.<p>- Unemployment is defined as (read this carefully) the proportion of people actively looking for a job. This means that if you want to reduce that ratio, you can either give them jobs, or convince them to give up looking, for example by giving them money for not looking. That's what they do in the  UK or in the Netherlands (relatively speaking). Guess what we do in France? The exact opposite, we  give you plenty of money if you look for a job.<p>- I'm not entirely sure how blacks in the South have it better than Arabs in France. I'm sure how they don't, though.<p>In conclusion, this yet another BS piece trying to extoll the theoretical virtues of wage slavery in the face of overwhelming evidence of the contrary.<p>They can pry my 35h (which have worked to create jobs) from my cold dead hands.",1262272687

Stop contributing to the horrid usability of each platform by mixing and matching UI paradigms in a vain effort to create something that ""fits"" all platforms.<p>Cross-platform UI toolkits are the devil for any serious app - each OS, whether Linux, OS X, or Windows, have their own UI needs and guidelines that <i>should be respected</i>.<p>It's high time that engineers started paying attention to making their software accessible and usable, instead of focusing all their attention on core ""features"" that nobody can figure out, or want to.",1231332826

423359,comment,423147,423299,0,0,Tichy,,,"That's odd because the very word ""scapegoat"" seems to stem from Christianity. I remember attending a catholic funeral and being really put off when the preacher suddenly started talking about sending the scapegoat into the desert.<p>However, I don't know much about it, never belonged to church and never received much of an education about Christianity.<p>Also doesn't Christianity make a big deal about Jesus sacrificing himself? What exactly do you mean by sacrifices?",1231332595
423358,comment,423147,423147,0,0,marvin,,,"I understand what this guy is talking about. Christianity holds a different meaning some places outside the US. I've met quite a few Christians in Norway, as part of going to a Christian private school for three years. A lot of these people have a <i>drive</i> that you don't see so often - a sense of purpose. I'm worried that there may be a correlation/causation issue here, but it's definitely something to investigate.<p>There is a lot of really evil people in the undeveloped parts of Africa, and I'm positive to any idea that can reverse this trend. Nothing the Western world has done so far has worked, and it may even be impossible for us to influence the African continent to become a better place to live.<p>But this story supports anecdotes I have heard from people working as missionaries in Africa. Christianity does good things to the mindsets of the people who live there. One missionary that talked to us had worked for 10 years translating the Bible to some obscure African tongue. One major snag in the process was getting the tribe he lived with to understand the concept of forgiveness. After a few weeks of on-and-off talking to the people, one of them understood - he replied that ""yes, we have a way to express not getting revenge for a wrongdoing. But no one would ever do that.""<p>Africa stumps me - I just don't understand why so many people there keep doing so many nasty things to one another. It's really un-PC to claim that there is a moral and ethical issue involved, but it's a belief I hold pretty strongly. I'm not saying that Christianity is the only way to fix this, but something is needed.",1231332439

Up here in Canada engineering is a regulated profession, and similar to doctors, we're expected to put the interests of the general public above our own.

Guys like this seem to live for the glory years of Reagan's trickle down economics but they forget the results of that policy.

It sounds like the projects you've been involved in haven't gotten off the ground, and it comes through that you don't really have valuable expertise that you bring to the table.<p>Either 1. become an expert at something 2. start coding or 3. get a job that most companies/startups have a need for:<p>- find an IT job at a startup, often these help out with engineering or writing internal applications<p>- Move into operations (i.e. setting up machines, systems, administering backend systems and applications) for a company that has a massive number of servers (like facebook, google, rackspace) or is in the process of scaling (twitter?, digg, etc).<p>Those two positions can be used as a springboard into dev jobs, but if you can get your projects to launch, you're going to learn far more from those experiences.",1231330804

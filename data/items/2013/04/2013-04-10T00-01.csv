I don't use Launchpad, but its presence on the system doesn't affect me any more than the presence of Photo Booth does.<p>I've been using OS X since version 10.2, I think (maybe even 10.1, looking at the timeline), and came to it in large part because it married things I liked about the Mac--but never quite enough to justify buying one--with the things I liked about FreeBSD and, to some degree, BeOS. And with <i>every iteration of the OS</i> it got easier for everybody to use.<p>But it's also gotten better for <i>power users</i> to use. Automator keeps seeing improvements. AppleScript, for both better and worse, doesn't seem to be going away. The Terminal app has gotten improvements with every release. And Mission Control -- whether you personally like it or not -- represents the latest in what's very clearly a quixotic quest on Apple's part to get everyone in the world to love virtual desktops. Mission Control may not be nerdy enough for you personally, but its very <i>existence</i> is pretty nerdy. (And I actually think power users should give it a chance; it's certainly not like anybody else's virtual desktop management system, but once I got used to it I found it struck a really nice balance between power and usability.)<p>Certainly, OS X is getting better at catering to neophytes and is bringing over ideas from iOS. But I don't see anything substantial that they're taking <i>away</i> from OS X in the process, and that should really be what concerns us, shouldn't it? If you start hearing credible rumors that they're taking away your shell prompt, then the sky may really be falling. But as long as you can still do everything you could before, complaining about the fact that you can <i>also</i> do swipey stuff on your trackpad and pull up a big iPhone grid of applications seems just a little silly.",1365555426

I believe there is huge potential for innovation here and that current collaboration tools are pretty primitive, although I have to say, Webex is a lifesaver. This Screenhero application looks like a great complement.<p>Companies can gain a lot by allowing people to work remotely - they vastly increase the talent pool and they save money by not having to supply office space. But like the article said, there's a cultural issue here. The whole thing reminds me of online dating ten years ago, when the perception was that it's for losers. Now seemingly everyone does it.<p>What's needed is basically validation for this lifestyle. Once that happens, the awesome tools will follow.

AT&T is going to lose the large majority of their customers in that city if they don't upgrade their network in response. But if AT&T does install gigabit fiber in that city, now they're in the position of having to make a large capital investment only to enter an aggressive price war. In either case, for that city, AT&T is screwed.<p>However, suppose AT&T decides instead to install gigabit fiber in, say, Chicago, or Hartford. Preemptively. Those cities immediately fall off the short list for the next Google Fiber rollout, because why put fiber in a city that already has it when there are so many that don't? So now <i>AT&T</i> owns the market in that city. They still had to make the capital investment, but at least now they stave off the subsequent price war. And if they do it in all the cities in their service area which would be good candidates, the next Google Fiber city ends up being in Verizon territory -- unless Verizon et al all do the same thing, in which case Google may just bow out having accomplished their goal.",1365554396

I don't believe it's necessary to have a co-founder to run a successful company. I agree completely with the headline. But the primary arguments for why this was done were to maintain equity and control. It came off as though he wasn't sharing equity with early employees and wanted to keep an extraordinary level of equity. It seems to me like the company is being set up for an acquisition in which 1 person and exactly 1 person benefits. Additionally, it felt like there was an innate distrust in all employees and potential business partners, and a need to assert dominance and complete control. What kind of professional relationships do you have to suffer through before the only thing you are interested in is total ownership? A company should be much more than a bunch of people being paid to do your bidding, and that's what I took away from the post.<p>> Have you ever even spoken to Ryan ? I've met him a few times - he's a genuinely nice guy, passionate about running good businesses which are successful and provide real benefits to his customers.<p>No I haven't, but I'm not sure I see it. I wouldn't go so far as to say he's not a nice guy (I have no idea), but I disagree strongly with some of his views from a leadership role, and it feels to me there are other motives than just making a great product and providing benefits to customers.",1365554296

I have friends that are sharing pictures of their children, embarrassing stories of their children, and personal details of their children's lives.  20 years ago, parents shared that kind of by word of mouth to other friends, or showed pictures at a family get-together.  The spread of that kind of information would usually die when reaching the intended recipient.  Now with the Internet, that information lives on and spreads much further, and is accessible to strangers for who knows how many years.  How can the adults of tomorrow expect a right to privacy when they can't even control what is being shared about them today?<p>My baby pictures live in a drawer in my parent's house (and on my hard drive just in case the originals accidentally get destroyed).  I want my family and descendants to be able to have those pictures, not the whole world.  Today's children (tomorrow's adults) aren't getting that option when their parents post their pictures and stories online.<p>It will probably be about 10 years before I start having children, and I will do my best to keep their lives private.  Though with my friends having children today, how can I ask them not to share stories and pictures of their children without seeming insensitive?  I certainly can't make the argument as a fellow parent.  I can try to convince politely that they are destroying any notion of privacy for their children.<p>The world is only going to get more interesting as technology gets more advanced, and as humanity grows up with the technology.",1365554235

- Do NOT use a framework. They're really easy, and you learn nothing. Once you have enough experience in HTML5/CSS3 to code a responsive site from scratch without looking stuff up, then frameworks are beneficial.
-Build yourself a portfolio site. Building my portfolio (<a href=""http://robs.im"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robs.im</a>) has taught me so much. If you want more on this, let me know. I have some snippets of JS/CSS/HTML from the first version of my portfolio site that you might be able to use, they're quite unique, but they didn't suit my purposes.
-Forrst and Dribbble. My very first piece of work came in the day after I got into Dribbble. I'm going to be really honest with you right now. What you have is probably not good enough to get you into Dribbble. For tips on how to improve, email me. Link on my site. If you improve a lot, I have a Dribbble invite.
-GitHub: Work on something on GitHub. If you're looking for a Project, I have a couple of side projects you could work on. Again, email me.
- Last tip: Don't lie about your age. The general opinion seems to be ""If you do good work, I don't care how old you are."" Take Jared Erondu for example. If you don't know who he is, look him up.

Once this happens, the value of the current bonds in the market will drop because who wants to buy bonds with a lower yield at the same price? After the Fukushima disaster, investors thought for sure that the JG would increase yield to get more money to repair infrastructure, deal with a weakened economy, etc. Many, many hedge fund managers have shorted Japanese bonds and all of them have lost money. Yet, the idea persists and every day, traders are shorting JG bonds, convinced that it can't stay low forever. No doubt, one day it will pay off, but will you be the lucky one to cash in?

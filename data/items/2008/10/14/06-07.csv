332019,comment,330470,330470,0,0,lvecsey,,,"Much of this has probably already been said but here are some of my observations. First, the lessons page was so long that I wonder whether they have really been learned. Had they been learned it would have been stated in a sentence or two. Rather, what you ended up with is a web page that you _wish_ you could have had weeks ago, to express much of your thinking at the time during the crisis.<p>The main thing that stuck out was how you seemed to be a programmer as an after thought. Particularly with the voting scheme; did you not have a genuine belief about the right way to pursue certain tasks? Whether from the beauty of a design, or the long standing approach it might have, or from a quick tweak to an existing infrastructure. I also don't think its enough to 'marvel' at two or more viewpoints. Just the fact that they can exist isn't enough, as you do a disservice to both/all parties unless you go with a decision, hopefully one that jives in some way with an internal model of how you see or have come to see things, and thus consistent.<p>Finally, I got the sense that you were 'hosting a party but constantly worrying about whether people are having a good time'.<p>These aren't meant to be brutal comments its just I think your series deserves an honest response!",1223967310

Good utilities make it quicker to create an application, but they don't create good programmers or good code by themselves.<p>Squeak (<a href=""http://www.squeak.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.squeak.org/</a>) was an interesting advent.  It made programming pretty simple.  A layperson playing with squeak could ""program,"" but it hardly stands in for even an introductory CS class.<p>I also take issue with the fact that you treat programming or web app development as if good is a static threshold.  A good web app a few years ago hardly compares today, and that can be seen in the evolution of almost any major website.",1223967128

Or do we have to settle this now for once and all?""<p>The awards committee cited papers Krugman'd written in 1979, 1981 and 1991 as the basis for their decision.<p>You can be certain Krugman had such great ideas because his work has been widely cited by other Economists and has been recognized through awards such as the Nobel.<p>That we're still debating Keynes and Smith only further indicates the far reaching impact of their work.",1223965396

Agencies like YC make the barrier to entry lower for a lot of companies.  This is not to say that it is easy at all, but good ideas/teams/people coming to the surface is getting more and more common when compared to the past.<p>Look at mattmaroon's slides that are on the front page right now.

On the other hand if you had said that if this slavish attitude is due to being subjected to outside rule (the Brits and before them the Mughals) it might make more sense.<p>Overall I agree with your observations, especially ""they'll follow you right into hell"".",1223964272

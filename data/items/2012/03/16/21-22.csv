What would make a difference is if there was a contract that protected consumers against loss of service. If this was approached as a default behaviour, it would single out the odd, shrewd business that flips the switch and turns off the lights.<p>That brings me to a topic of balancing consumer and business rights for the sake of continuity and data protection.

As the company grows & matures, and the employees do as well -- since they're interested in keeping employees ""for the long haul"", the collective ages of the bulk of the employees would advance largely in synch -- then the creative ideas should simply take different forms.<p>I do think they should consider carefully who is forced to sit out, though -- and avoid doing things where it's always the same people who can't come.  This is company money being used to reward employees.  If it only rewards some of them, due to factors quite probably out of the employees' control, that's simply unfair.

3715393,comment,3715171,3715323,64,0,tptacek,,,"RSA signature verification code had been written (in many places, most notably in Mozilla's NSS library) to ""parse"" the RSA signature message block that resulted from the public key verification operation. RSA signature verification is a little like RSA encryption ""inverted"", and the element being encrypted is a hash of the content being signed. What vulnerable implementations would do was, they'd perform the public key transform and the extract the hash, then just check the hash against the content.<p>The problem is that a SHA2 hash of a message is much smaller than an RSA message block. The remainder of the content of the block is supposed to be ""padding"". ""RSA padding"" is one of the worst names in cryptography, because it isn't so much ""padding"" as it is ""armor"". If you don't pad in a very particular way, and check the padding scrupulously, you end up with multiple different vulnerabilities.<p>In this case, the vulnerability was that libraries like NSS weren't checking the padding at all (they naively assumed that if an RSA public key operation produced a SHA2 hash of a complicated message, whoever generated the signature must have the private key). The Bleichenbacher attack was that for E=3 RSA, the unchecked padding created a huge amount of ""head room"" in which garbage data would be ignored. Because of the low exponent, the modular multiplications performed by the signing (private) operation might never wrap the modulus; in other words, the modulus was irrelevant, because the math worked out to a simple cubing/cube root without ever hitting it. The bits produced by this ""key oblivious"" E=3 signing operation were gibberish, of course... but the RSA implementations weren't checking them, because they were ""just padding"". As long as the message bits included a hash in a predictable place, they looked valid.<p>The correct way to perform this operation was not to extract <i>anything</i> from the RSA message block produced by verification. Instead, the verifier should have simply created their own properly-padded message block from the original content and verified the whole block byte-for-byte. So the bug was, basically, trying to parse RSA signature blocks at all.<p>The end result was, because RSA verifiers were effectively ignoring most of the signature bits in the message, attackers could use trivial (as in, type- it- into- a- python- repl) math to generate valid-looking signatures for any SHA2 hash.<p>This bug was in RSA code for years and years and years.<p>Don't build crypto.",1331933295

Not only there's the danger that Steve Blank points out [1], that you might be making the mistake of listening to the wrong costumer segment (which is really hard to tell). But there's also the problem that, deep down, no one really knows what they want, much less how much you would pay for what you want. There's a huge discrepancy between ""how much your costumer will tell you he'll pay"", and ""how much he'll pay"". And telling the difference between those is also really hard to do.<p>So do ask your users.

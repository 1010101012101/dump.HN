If someone with that level of success wanted to talk with me about their project, actually had some kind of written plan for it (even just a dozen pages) and could actually rent out space on top of that, they'd at least get me interested.<p>I think most developers end being approached by a mid-level manager (often freshly laid off) who has an idea outside of their area of expertise, not so much as one page for a spec, no money and only has unwritten promises of equity for pay.  I know I've been approached by a few over the last decade.  If I bet on them, I'd have to try and understand what they want built, build it on my own time and hope that they honor their promises of pay in the future.  Maybe there have been successes in that case, but it seems like such a long shot, especially when almost anything else offers a better reward-to-risk ratio, that it's never worth pursuing.<p>I think that the repeated offers that developers often get from non-technical founders start to sound like the offers writers get to develop a novel based on an idea non-writer has.  Very often, the developer has more than enough drive and imagination to develop their own idea, just an an author can develop stories on their own.",1336697707

If there's no disclosure and editorial keeps referring to certain products or companies without any implication of a relationship, that's just payola. Sadly, there are plenty of outlets and magazines that are suspected of or have been caught doing this.<p>Increasingly, though, reputable media organizations are doing collaborations with brands, such as with merchandise, pull outs, giveaways, or in clearly marked 'products we like' sections (essentially advertising as content - super popular in fashion and women's magazines). It's a rapidly spreading model in the magazine space in particular. Monocle magazine is one of the exemplary examples - <a href=""http://www.reallypractical.com/2009/07/06/is-monocle-the-future-of-publishing-and-content-marketing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reallypractical.com/2009/07/06/is-monocle-the-fut...</a><p>The big traffic/small CPM model is still too lucrative online for the bigger online publishers to spend too much time on the newer ideas, but the hands of other media have been forced by tumbling revenues and, in a funny twist, are becoming more progressive.<p>On quality, though, the readership will ultimately vote with their feet (or clicks) - outlets that fall into the payola trap will suffer audience drops and legal trouble, outlets that transparently entertain or inform their readership in <i>conjunction</i> with advertisers will thrive (as Monocle is).<p>Separate from pairing up with media outlets, many advertisers are now going 'direct' to audiences with content-driven campaigns (not just videos, but entire content sites). Digitally prodigious companies and startups have been doing this for ages with blogs and the like, but the approach is now becoming mainstream and being taken on by the big brands.<p>Ad blockers are next to useless on all of this but, IMHO, the end result is better. Outlets and brands have to start telling interesting stories and sharing interesting content, instead of tricking us into clicking graphics and becoming leads.",1336697145

Other civilizations have failed in the past for mismanaging resources.<p>Your argument optimistically assumes that we'll be able to cope with the environmental changes that our activity is causing. Supply is only one part of the equation. For example, our CO_2 emissions, whether or not they cause global warming (that's mostly controversial in the US AFAIK), are causing ocean acidification, which could have a massive impact on marine life.<p>In dynamic systems as complex as the earth, tipping points are impossible to predict. That being said, we've never been pushing as hard for one.<p>Regarding growth, I have a hard time understanding how an exponential growth of our activity can be sustainable, especially in terms of energy requirements, which should be proportional (AFAIK).

In the past I've worked in organizations that have their own internal testing but those are often baselined against the person who originally wrote them.  The great thing with your service is that you could also, once you've gained traction, normalize the data and create ""the"" benchmark to score testers.  You can even splice by geographic region, etc. You could go further once you establish your service as the ""industry"" standard allow programmers themselves self-test and post (show off) their scores on resumes, linkedin, github, etc. in effect quantifying their qualifications. Could even explore a partnership with CodeAcademy downstream.  What you need to do now is get some validation, a way to say your tests are sufficient and/or above average.

The bus into Downtown is filled with these kids literally blowing-off their education.<p>Talking to teachers at the school reveals what you'd expect.

Until someone can stand up and say there is a problem culturally in black populations that needs fixing, or can determine what our school systems are doing wrong specifically to harm our black population our country will continue to suffer the consequences.

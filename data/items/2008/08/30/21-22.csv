291066,comment,290342,291037,0,0,tptacek,,,"This is true if your business plan is a Hail Mary pass for an acquisition by Google, Microsoft, or IBM. That's because the goals of the founders and the goals of the employees aren't aligned; it's broken in the same kind of way as Freakonomics says real estate agents are.<p>I hope it's not true for startups that aren't drugged out on VC money. I don't know whether it is or it isn't. I can't tell, because I'm one of 3 founders, and the company is pretty much going to do what we want it to.<p>Everyone says ""yeah, but the work is better at a startup"". I actually don't know if that's true --- I've been through a lot of startup bitch work (and wiring up yet another web form to MySQL is exactly that), and I've been tempted by some pretty awesome BigCo roles. Our work here is pretty awesome (for instance, we've got people paid to hack on gnuradio), but maybe you can get that same work at Motorola.<p>This is a huge question and I don't have a good answer for it and I'm glad you brought it up. Outside the get-rich-quick schemes, what can we offer employees of real and lasting value? For a lot of us, it's training and reputation; but I want to keep the talent we're developing.",1220133119

Or most of his business dealings. Or his twenty-second birthday party. Or any number of the interesting incidents which would no doubt have occurred in his life. Charles Foster Kane was a fascinating character who lived a full life, surely he didn't spend his whole time crying over his sled, did he?<p>The scary part is that I'm actually starting to think this might be a good idea for a movie.",1220132798

I also disagree that an attempt to wear unlabeled clothes is part of another conformist consumer movement (an indie backlash).<p>As for your second question, I've bought a few (unlabeled) shirts that I really like from Old Navy and yes, even Target and Wal-Mart.",1220132472

291053,comment,290352,290592,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"As another former gym rat, 100 pushups isn't a bad idea at all.  The ability to do 100 pushups will not make you ""bulky"" at all. It isn't the same thing as the guys who can bench press 300 pounds and only squat 180. Push-ups are a ""core"" exercise and if you do them right you're working everything from your pecs to your psoas.<p>Now, I totally agree with you that neglecting the rest of your body is a bad idea. Most men who are prone to being ""gym rats"" totally ignore leg exercises. If you're sitting down all day programming, your legs eventually will get totally screwed up, so it is a good idea to do something with them. If you're totally fat and out of shape, walking for an hour per day is more important than doing a bunch of pushups.<p>I also disagree with the guys in the article. If they gained a bunch of weight, simply doing pushups (even 100 at a time) is not going to burn off what they put on. I don't want to discourage them, because pushups can contribute greatly to overall health, fitness, and self esteem. But, if losing fat is what they are after, they need to stop stocking the fridge with free beer and soda and start a track club.",1220131197

But then I continued to abuse my eyes with cheap contacts and ended up with a corneal infection which left one eye legally blind. So, glasses are my only option now. Make your choices wisely, and go with the best. I think that contacts are not healthy for your eyes over years of use.",1220131155

291044,comment,290793,290948,0,0,etal,,,"The ads for Jane Street Capital are pretty good. (They pop up in Gmail for me sometimes.)<p>0. They get the job title right. If you're a quant, you know it. Is a startup CTO a rockstar or a ninja? It's unclear.<p>1. They mention the domain knowledge applicants should have. (e.g. finance, not just the technologies used.) Electrical engineering doesn't really have anything to do with what RedWire does -- sounds more like they're in the marketing business.<p>2. They describe some specific tech, and explain why it's used. Ads mention Scheme and other languages, explain that functional programming and program optimization matter for the high-performance computing they do, and state that Ocaml fits their needs best. Pretty credible.<p>3. They give a realistic impression of the workplace culture. Clearly, JSC has a carefully culled group of intense people with heavy CS and math backgrounds, surrounded by even more intense traders. Money and prestige matter the most; candy is not mentioned. One can assume collared shirts and possibly ties are involved.<p>So I'm not the sort of person they're looking for, and I can tell -- I'm not tempted to fudge an application and add noise to the signal. But if I had majored in financial engineering, loved money, and truly did have Free Electron-level programming ability, this would be enough to get my attention.",1220130124
291043,comment,290746,291041,0,0,orib,,,"Really? On my Debian system, at least an old version of the software is in the repositories 90% of the time, and simply doing:<p><pre><code>    sudo apt-get build-dep $PACKAGENAME\n</code></pre>\ngets all the stuff I need to build the software, and then all that's left is<p><pre><code>    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/local/test/prefix\n    make\n    make install\n</code></pre>\nand things Just Work. I've never had a big problem with dependencies -- other than Xorg, where the issue wasn't with obscureness. The issue was with requiring a number of dependencies from git. That sort of problem really isn't something you can resolve by anything other than documentation.<p>As for Sourceforge.net, it's bug tracker software has the worst UI I've ever seen. Even email beats it, IMO.<p>But I agree with you about the need for easier code browsing and documentation. Still, tools like 'cscope' go a long way to figuring out what's going on with the source, and grep + ctags in vim will take you the rest of the way.<p>edit: fix formatting",1220130053

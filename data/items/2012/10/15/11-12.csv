4654675,comment,4653521,4654550,5,0,ocharles,,,"> WHY would you want to do validation of a ""complex"" field at the db level?<p>Anything I build on top of this database now benefits from all of my consistency and integrity checks. While it won't prevent me from trying to put bad data in, it will prevent me from actually doing the storage (instead, it will remind me that I'm a terrible human and I forgot to validate certain parts of data).<p>> I mean, for a web app you end up with 3 (!!) layers of validation now: 1. client (javascript), 2. app (...), 3. db (javascript? PL/something?)<p>This is a legitimate concern, but not all applications need all these checks. Hopefully you've abstracted things apart enough so that you can build your application reusing logic where possible.<p>> as an added ""bonus"", you loose the ability to migrate to a different db<p>I hear this one a lot, and it's so misguided imo. Different database systems are implemented completely differently. If we strictly adhered to relational algebra and the relational model then we might be in a position where you could switch out databases and have the same performance. However, what we have no doesn't work like that. Even if you strictly use standard SQL, I can almost guarantee that for large databases you'll see difference performance characteristics over the different database implementations.<p>> why don't people keep the rdbms ""slim"" and mean and write the logic in your app code, where it belongs?<p>That <i>isnt</i> where it belongs at all. Your app should interact with the database, but the database should have the final say in guaranteeing consistency. This provides an excellent foundation that allow you to now layer future projects on top of, without being tied to a specific application framework/library/programming language. Remember, we already have the impedance mismatch so whenever you map from the database to your application, you make a decision about how that mapping is done. So even if you offload all the database stuff to your 'app', you limit yourself to what you can truly do with the database.<p>Seriously, let the database do its job and be a database.<p>> you don't even have version control for the code in stored db procedures and things like that!!<p>This is nonsense. <a href=""http://pyrseas.projects.postgresql.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pyrseas.projects.postgresql.org/</a> <a href=""https://github.com/theory/sqitch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/theory/sqitch</a> <a href=""https://github.com/depesz/Versioning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/depesz/Versioning</a>.

After all, there are lots of angry people all across the world that hate the Western world and want to hurt it, but most can't.</i><p>Put this way, it's even more stupid. It's as if people go about ""hating the west"" for no reason (or because their ""religion tells them so"", which is a Glenn Beck level argument).<p>A thing called colonialism did exist. Some hundred million people were killed in invasions and wars and while fighting for their freedom, and some 2 billion people were living under foreign occupation.<p>And then you had a thing called post-colonialism, that does exist. With hundreds of interventions and resource-grubbing all over the world. With so called ""banana republics"" set up. And with countries thousands of miles away of some areas, have the audacity to believe they have ""strategic interests"" in those areas, and that it gives them the right to intervene, get their resources for cheap, place puppet governments, etc. You know, like some country in the American continent controlling Philippines or killing people in Vietnam.<p><i>What sets the Arabs apart is their vast oil riches. Without that, they wouldn't have the money or power to do anything to the West.</i><p>Arabs, as in ""arab states"" could not care less about ""doing anything to the west"". What sets those people apart is indeed their vast oil riches, that had provoked unprecedented resource-grubbing, puppet government establishment and invasions western powers.<p>Does anyone imagine what a foreign power invading the US would mean to the US people, and under some BS pretext at that? But invading Iraq under the BS pretext of WMDs, wrecking the country in the process, killing hundreds of thousands, taking control of the oil and leaving them in a state of civil war by playing into the competing tribal and religious interests, is somehow ""normal"", because they are ""arabs"".<p>So, the people there have a lot of reasons to ""blame the west"". It's not like they have any spectacular resources, either. WWII era guns and ammo, and cheaply made stuff, while the ""west"" kills them with drones and 21st century military technology.<p>><i>The minute that crude oil loses its relevance to the Western world, the Arabs will just go back to what they were before - a bunch of desert nomads with no real power.</i><p>Actually they had a huge empire, including parts of Europe, even before the crude oil gained relevance.<p>The west managed to turn them to ""a bunch of desert nomads with no real power"" precisely when it wanted to get ahold of cheap labour and later the crude oil.",1350298811

So, it&#x27;s like buying a huge (the largest by far) global telco which only allows texting. In some poor countries, that&#x27;s all people really use a cell phone for anyways. Calls are too expensive, so you see far more people texting than talking.<p>As big as thing thing is, it&#x27;s possibly headed to 1 billion users. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s about as massive as anything which exists right now. It&#x27;s one big platform among very few that are operating at that level.<p>I just don&#x27;t think there is any comparison. Money doesn&#x27;t matter. You make big plays. If Zuckerberg were thinking small when he built Facebook, it would be a small e-commerce store selling T-shirts or something.",1392958798

For example, it is used on the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) to improve the position obtained from wheel odometry [1]. As you mentionned, the big accomplishment is doing this in real time on a mobile device. On a typical mobile ARM processor, it would probably be very slow and drain the battery in no time. That&#x27;s why they are using a custom coprocessor designed specifically for image processing and computer vision. The next challenge is porting the existing visual odometry algorithms on this new processor. It looks like hiDOF did the implementation [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rob.20184/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rob.20184/abstrac...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://hidof.com/projects/project-tango/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hidof.com/projects/project-tango/</a>",1392958729

People who are largely aware and untroubled do seem to be in the minority.<p>> This view of the world is just lazy. Almost as lazy as &quot;remember, if you&#x27;re using a service for free, you&#x27;re not the customer, YOU&#x27;RE THE PRODUCT!&quot;, which seems to get parroted every single time there is any discussion related to google, facebook, microsoft, instagram, twitter, or any other web company that uses ads as a revenue model.<p>It appears to be, if not 100% correct, a generally good heuristic, and a way of pointing out to people that the costs of participating in nominally free services are often hidden. Perhaps you could explain how this is lazy.<p>> If you don&#x27;t like these services, don&#x27;t use them / If you don&#x27;t like modernity, stop using modernity.<p>Whew! Simple binary options. It&#x27;s all clear now, and anybody who&#x27;s thinking about this can safely choose one without worrying any further (or being accused of being... lazy, right?).<p>Or maybe some of us &quot;lazy&quot; people would like to explore the possibility of having a world where we can have the benefits of the technologies and minimize the problems.<p>> Have you, or any of the other people on HN who repeat this ad nauseum, ever considered the possibility that the people running google are actually just hackers who got lucky enough to have the resources to pursue projects that they think are cool?<p>I suspect many of them are. My acquaintances who work there seem to be.<p>But perhaps you are familiar with the aphorism &quot;the road to hell is paved with good intentions&quot; (though perhaps this is something else you consider &quot;lazy&quot;). It doesn&#x27;t matter what motivated those who pursued a thorough knowledge and practice of various nuclear fission techniques, the fact is that they have various drawbacks (some pretty serious) that aren&#x27;t a matter of individual opt-in / opt-out. This is true of technologies that extend legibility of personal spaces and activities.<p>> If you don&#x27;t like modernity, stop using modernity. Move to a homestead in the pacific northwest, never use a telephone, never use grid power, grow your own vegetables, grow your own cattle, and keep away from the evil, scary spies at gooooogggllleeee<p>I think I&#x27;ve seen this suggestion before, but less in earnest:<p><a href=""http://www.theonion.com/video/google-opt-out-feature-lets-users-protect-privacy,14358/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theonion.com/video/google-opt-out-feature-lets-us...</a>",1392957137

I am quite confident that we’ll be able to make computer programs that perform specific complex tasks very well. But how do we make a computer program that decides what it wants to do? How do we make a computer decide to care on its own about learning to drive a car? Or write a novel?<p>Consciousness, creativity, and desire are all quite distinct things.  It is very important for people who are attempting to approach the coming reality of artificial intelligence to be able to distinguish between different things like that.<p>There have been computer programs that decide what they want to do for decades.  Perhaps you were thinking of a specific human-like type of decision process, but if so, you must say so and reason that way.  Otherwise you are just conveying some fuzzy thoughts.  And the problem is that you are doing so in the context of real scientific undertakings with results directly applicable to your thoughts.<p>A computer deciding what to care about or learn or what behavior to engage in &quot;on its own&quot; is related to the previous topic you mention, and in and of itself, does not require artificial general intelligence.<p>How do we make a computer program write a novel?  I think that is a good question and an effective answer to it I believe _might_ be in the category of &#x27;real&#x27; artificial general intelligence.  However, I think that it will probably soon be possible to create &#x27;narrow&#x27; AIs that can generate novels without being generally intelligent.  <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/business/computer-generated-articles-are-gaining-traction.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/business/computer-generate...</a>",1392956889

Some people believe that they might not actually exist, and the exchange will default, which is why those bitcoins are now worth less.  About 2/3rds less.<p>Previous to MtGox freezing transfers of Bitcoins in and out of  your account, they had restrictions on the transfers of $USD in and out of your account - that resulted in the opposite situation, in which people who wanted to get their $USD out of the system, had to do so with bitcoins (which were, at that time, transferable) - they were therefore willing to pay <i>MORE</i> for bitcoins on MtGox, than other exchanges, just so they could somehow liquidate.  This is why, historically, MtGox had a higher value for bitcoins - it was an artifact of customers betting that there was a solvency issue on the $USD in the system.<p>Everything about MtGox is a train wreck right now.

You&#x27;d have to pry it from the cold, dead hands of others. The problem is that we currently don&#x27;t separate those who would like to provide their information from those who would like to refuse because we&#x27;re greedy for as much information as we can get, or we don&#x27;t trust people to make the &quot;right&quot; decision.<p>A system that worked well and that accomodated both views would be one that really respected a user&#x27;s choice--one that could handle data in a centralized or individual fashion, accordingly. Data that was willingly given could be used under the terms of the agreement without risk of angering people who don&#x27;t want their data to be analyzed. It would ultimately provide the same benefits while respecting individuals and not creating controversy.<p>In the medical records situation, you&#x27;d have a group of people at one end that would be quite pleased to contribute their information, a group at the other end that would immediately decline, and quite a few people in the middle who would likely fall somewhat evenly to either side. Sure, some people would probably be fear-mongered out of sharing, but I imagine there&#x27;d be a lot less of that going on if people knew they could actually make a meaningful individual choice for privacy if they chose to do so. When opt-outs are buried, hidden, and it&#x27;s not clear that they actually work, skepticism and fear grow. In a system that doesn&#x27;t try to railroad people to sacrifice their privacy--a system that actually respects the individual&#x27;s choice--fear would be reduced.<p>The only way to cast questions around this type of privacy as &quot;a debate&quot; involves changing the issue to compelled sharing of personal information. In a debate over forced participation, I think it&#x27;s pretty easy to see why thoughts start to drift towards totalitarian concerns.<p>I think a system that offered real choice for each individual may drastically reduce the current problems from both perspectives, at the price of some engineering overhead.",1392956682

This helps in keeping production costs down, and it also raises the melting temperature of the chocolate so that it doesn&#x27;t melt in the wrapper while it sits on store shelves.<p>You typically will not find noticable amounts of added emulsifiers in cooking chocolate, as they detract from the taste and texture of the final product.  Furthermore, pure cooking chocolate should be able to be melted, reshaped and reset (tempered) over and over again with no degredation in quality.<p>Chocolate with added emulsifiers, however, is easy to spot because when it melts and re-sets, it has white splotches on the surface.  If your milk chocolate has white bits, that typically means its a lower quality, like basically every mass produced chocolate in US / Australia / probably elsewhere.<p>If you really enjoy chocolate, you should consider buying cooking chocolate.  :)",1392955952

I have a bad habit (from the Orcad days) of saving in-progress board layouts under different names, as insurance against program crashes. Kicad used to be somewhat unstable too (3-4 years ago) but it&#x27;s gotten much better (kudos for the Kicad support, by the way). In this case CircuitHub actually selected an old backup file.<p>2. Spreadsheet BOM import. I liked how most of the passives showed up automagically, but there will always be some unique parts out there.<p>3. DRC. Is it in there somewhere, or is the user fully responsible?<p>Pricing is nothing special, but I expected that. The interface is light-years ahead of most board/assembly houses out there, though. The SVG board and schematic are a nice touch.<p>The project is below; note that the main part couldn&#x27;t be sourced, so the line item was dropped.<p><a href=""https://circuithub.com/projects/mng2222/tcm8240"" rel=""nofollow"">https://circuithub.com/projects/mng2222/tcm8240</a>",1392955246

With Nginx for example, you can build in SSL support and then configure a directive to request a client cert at which point the web browser will load a relevant certificate to choose to pass along.  More so, Nginx can be configured to extract information from the client certificate and use it as variables.<p><a href=""http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSslModule#ssl_client_certificate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSslModule#ssl_client_certificate</a>

Even better is by serial or what have you.<p>Now my 2 cents on the problem; it confuses people, revocation and issuance.  I'm guessing here DoD had certificates built into our ID cards and that was extracted with the reader at a need.  Not sure, just a guess.  Personally I think the cryptic nature that is command line Openssl is what slows down the mob from pushing new tech unto everyone.  Think about it.  Some comments present are disappointing for hacker news; you should be playing with cryptic technologies and making them work.<p>Want a startup idea?

3659106,comment,3658851,3658851,2,0,andyzweb,,,"Concurrency is the biggest area of study and contention here.<p>I still think an exciting problem that hasn't received much attention is thread/process affinity.<p>When scheduling threads the operating system picks a logical execution unit to do the actual processing. Logical execution units have some kind of shared resource between them. Let's say we had a machine with 2 Intel Core i7-2600K in it. That computer would have 16 logical execution units (2 CPUs x 4 cores x 2 threads per core) All 16 units would share the same RAM. 8 logical units on the same CPU would share the same L3 cache. 2 logical units on the same CPU and same core would share the same L1 and L2 cache.<p>Now I want to apply Fast-Fourier transformation to a stereo audio signal and want to process each channel in it's own thread. When the operating system schedules those threads to run it it might be best to pick two logical execution units on the same CPU core and reschedule it there every time it executes. This would maximize hits on instruction caches and data caches, with the benefit of not polluting unnecessary caches. The opposite of this would be having the threads run on logical execution units on different CPUs and never rescheduling them to the same logical execution unit twice in a row. This would drastically reduce the likelihood of cache-hits and possibly pollute the caches of every logical execution unit.<p>I lost my train of thought here.
In any event. Processor affinity and scheduling are two things ripe for improvement on the operating system level. That said most modern operating systems handle SMP pretty well and there is far more improvement to be made in the userland.",1330739523

3659104,comment,3657542,3657542,3,0,CyberFonic,,,"I have managed many projects and hit deadlines and delivered to budget.  The principles are simple:  I would create a project plan with a granularity of 2-3 man weeks per task.  I would then go and discuss the plan with the team leaders and refine the plan to the 3-5 man day task level with their input.  Given the available resources I would then add 20% and come up with a target date based on a realistic starting date.<p>There is one very important distinction.  When the requirements are unclear or non-existent, then the project could only be for the creation of the missing specification and repeat the process once the specification was signed off.<p>As you may guess I have had many board level meetings where the stakeholders were horrified at how long things would take. That's where the politics start.  Typically somebody pulled a deadline and budget out of their a<i></i><i></i>* and demanded that I make it happen.  That's where being a professional is very important.  They either meet my demands or I decline the project.  For example, in one situation I declined a project.  They brought in a succession of 5 project managers and then axed the project years late and millions over budget.  If it is impossible, then no amount of table banging and shouting is going to repeal the laws of physics, etc.<p>You only need to read up on failed projects, like the FBI's Virtual Case File System (great write up in IEEE Spectrum), to realise that projects failing to meet deadlines are typically a result of management incompetence and rarely due to failing by the technical team - but that too does happen, especially if the specs are too loose and the team leaders fail to maintain focus.",1330739458

3659101,comment,3658860,3658860,2,0,bicknergseng,,,"Amazing how this thread took over the whole first page of results from that search.<p>There's a few things that are interesting about this whole thing though.<p>First, that HN's users are this good.  Many other communities across the web eventually degrade into a news entertainment troll parties, sometimes needing to be removed in order to preserve some kind of dignity on the mother site.  I'm sure there are worst things said here, but they are very much the exception.<p>The phrase itself also got me thinking about how people express things on the web.  I imagine the majority of comments with that phrase have some malicious intent, but there is also the possibility that whatever idea the user is trying to convey is something not easily expressed in text through the internet impersonally.  For example, a conversation on racial stereotypes will inherently have racist undertones, but it is entirely possible that people want to discuss it genuinely without meaning to offend people.  Part of the problem is that it's very difficult to communicate things like sincerity, empathy, etc. via plaintext.  Another part of the problem is that people are very...willing...to be offended... though I haven't decided how much of a role the internet plays from this angle.<p>One takeaway: if you aren't meaning to offend people, choose better words on the internet.  It's likely the easiest way of saying something is offensive and will offend.",1330739339

3659095,comment,3658528,3658528,4,0,sbucher,,,"The author is making a straw man argument, though it does not seem to be intentional (edit: I am referring to Rubinstein's original analysis). The author points out that using data for a single class and single year is not a reliable indicator (second graph). That is uncontested and exactly why ratings are based on 3 years of data and multiple classes where possible. Even this cannot provide a single, accurate percentile value. That is why confidence intervals are used and are rather prominently displayed in all the graphs; e.g. <<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/school/656-ps-009-teunis-g-bergen/teachers&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/school/656-ps-009-teunis-g...</a>;<p>Given the example above, there is one teacher who has is 50th percentile for career math, but the confidence interval (CI) indicates that this may really be anywhere from well below average to well above average. In contrast there is another teacher with a value of 3 and the highest bounds of the CI still place them well below average. Conversely there is a teacher that is 90th pctl and even the lowest bounds of the the confidence interval still makes this a highly effective teacher.<p>In sum, the data make evident that a few teachers are fairly unambiguously ineffective (at least with regards to test results), a few are unambiguously effective, but for the majority the most that can be said is that they are neither the best nor the worst, but somewhere in the middle.<p>So if you reserve yourself to making conclusions merited by the data, then there is some value to this (i.e. identifying the extremely ineffective and effective). As it stands now, the teacher with a 3 may very well have tenure and be paid considerably more that the teacher with a 90 (given that pay is a function largely of seniority and education, and nearly all teachers have tenure). That is what this exercise is meant to address.<p>So you definitely cannot assign a fine-grained single value to every teacher (and the authors analyses speak to that issue), but there does not mean you cannot make any conclusions at all. If folks make conclusions that exceed what is supported by the data that is a fault of the analyst or perhaps a function of poor communication or visualization, not  evidence that the data is junk.<p>That said, the test could be improved (and supposedly are being improved) and the very least the measurements place more focus on the subjects being tested.<p>And the teacher effectiveness data is only 40% of the new approach to evaluating teachers in NY; the other 60% including peer evaluation. It may be useful if that became part of the public data so a more balanced picture is available; but it is unclear if that data would be public.",1330739034

We fail to look at our partner from his/her perspective. I broke up with my ex because he failed to see my point of view and lacked generosity on understanding how I feel. I find that most guys in tech fail to express feelings and emotions when they're in relationships and fail to see things from their partners' point of view. What girl would want to date someone who's only into himself?<p>I think someone like you would help guys become more self-aware on what their actions have on their partners, and help them be more considerate. This is not about becoming someone you're not, but being more open and considerate about what their girlfriends when in relationship. Trust me, women don't need that much time, but how you can communicate that to us matters more.",1330738519

Furthermore, I doubt that any congressperson would consider Apple's use of ""create or support"" to be misleading, because it is absolutely the standard usage of the term in these sorts of assessments. That does not, of course, mean that some senator who smells television coverage won't take notice of the confusion and grandstand his or her condescension for his or her electorate. It might even be a successful strategy, but we don't have to help.<p>Obviously I haven't audited the numbers.

3659015,comment,3657955,3658944,1,0,dmoney,,,"The movies ""Hackers"" and ""The Net"" were released in 1995.  ""Hackers"" used the term to mean ""someone who penetrates computer security"".  The one use of the term in in ""The Net"" [1] was ambiguous as to whether it meant this sense, or Paul Graham's sense of the word[2]; but 90% of the movie was about security and counter-security.  So I'd say that the [counter]security connotation was common usage by that time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/n/net-script-transcript-sandra-bullock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/n/net-script-tran...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/gba.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/gba.html</a>",1330736929

3659004,comment,3658528,3658737,2,0,moonchrome,,,">As far as I can see, nobody has come up with a magical metric for rating teachers. If anything, most of the metrics out there are outright counterproductive -- and you can see it in schools across America, where teachers are being constantly urged to inflate grades for their 'customers', overlook plagiarism, ignore the most talented students in favor of the least talented ones, and help drive down the quality of education for the next generation.<p>You can do things to improve the quality of data - use multiple metrics, don't announce them up front and certainly don't standardize - so that optimizing for a specific test doesn't justify the cost, also change testing as needed/with dynamic feedback and use the results to get insight in to the problem. Computers can only help with this sort of thing. Ultimately it's about defining the objective of education, what environment students are supposed to be prepared by it and exposing them to that environment, just like you want to test the system in production as soon as you can, benchmarks are always synthetic and can't replace ""real world"" testing.<p>Data won't capture everything and could in fact be 100% misleading - that's the nature of imperfect knowledge - but if used correctly it can help provide insight in to situation. Just don't conflate benchmarks and reality, use it as a tool for improved feedback/analysis. Of course this approach is absolutely incompatible with bureaucratic systems. Heck the entire education system is based around optimizing for arbitrary/artificial evaluation metrics (all that crap about higher education and signaling, that starts with primary education).<p>As for favoring least talented over most talented, that's just different objectives, I don't think it changes with more quantifiable information about students performance, do you want to raise the bottom at the expense of the top.",1330736711

The common use of the term ""Creating Jobs"" is only those ""directly employed"" by your company (i.e on your company's payroll).

It really does not matter what it is, swing, Latin, waltz - just fucking do it.<p>A lot of women like to dance and a lot of men do not. Knowing how to dance is like having bulletproof patents, a killer product, two million paying customers, and a personal endorsement from the President of the United States of how bitchin your company is. Get over your fears, take a class with a bunch of other newbies, and GO OUT! There is nothing more exhilarating than asking a beautiful woman to dance and her saying yes. It is truly a remarkable feeling that most men will never experience.<p>It solves two problems. First, there is absolutely nothing worse than approaching someone out of the blue. It is super awkward, and unless you are Justin Bieber, never works. Two, physical proximity is a <i>requirement</i> on the dance floor. Attraction is enormously physical, and dancing is the best way to break that barrier without being a creeper.<p>Find a beginner Salsa lesson in your area and get moving...<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention one thing.

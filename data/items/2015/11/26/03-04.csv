I am not sorry for what I said.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be sorry for what you said to be sorry for offending or hurting the person.  You can stand by what you said entirely while still being sorry that what you said hurt them.  Saying &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I said something that offended you&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re retracting your words but it does mean that you are saddened for having caused the other party pain, even if you don&#x27;t think their pain is rational.<p>> but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that your outrage is [...] totally your fault<p>If you&#x27;re concerned about &quot;fault&quot; in this case, I&#x27;m not really convinced you do feel bad.  &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I said something that offended you&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;I&#x27;m a terrible person who is totally in the wrong&quot;; it&#x27;s &quot;I regret that I did something that resulted in you being hurt.&quot;  If you stand entirely by what you said it might even mean something like &quot;I wish it were possible to go back and time and restate that in a way that would achieve what I intended without hurting you.&quot;<p>> &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot; means I feel bad about something and I don&#x27;t want to do it again<p>Ultimately, I think this is what it&#x27;s all about.  &quot;I&#x27;m sorry you were offended&quot; is (at its absolute best) &quot;I feel bad about you being offended&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I offended you&quot; is &quot;I feel bad about you being offended and I don&#x27;t want to do it again.&quot;",1448510371

I have a clear example of Apple prioritizing form over function in the charger itself:<p>In 2011, my wife and I bought new laptops (a MacBook Pro and a ThinkPad) around the same time - based on the same Intel chipset and with similar CPUs (might have been one speed tier apart). The setup was power-hungry, so my ThinkPad came with a proverbial charging brick - big and bulky, but it kept the laptop fed no matter what. Her MacBook came with a standard Mac charger (much smaller and lighter). But if she used her laptop when plugged in, it didn&#x27;t charge much (if at all). And if she did something particularly demanding, the battery could even drain (fortunately, she didn&#x27;t do that too frequently).<p>This seemed odd and I remember coming across an explanation online (while researching something else): It was just physics. My ThinkPad charger was something like twice as powerful as her MacBook charger, but they were both feeding roughly similar internals.

Caltech designed and manufactured the world&#x27;s first fully Quasi Delay Insensitive processor. During demonstrations, the researchers amazed viewers by loading a simple program which ran in a tight loop, pulsing one of the output lines after each instruction. This output line was connected to an oscilloscope. When a cup of hot coffee was placed on the chip, the pulse rate (the effective &quot;clock rate&quot;) naturally slowed down to adapt to the worsening performance of the heated transistors. When liquid nitrogen was poured on the chip, the instruction rate shot up with no additional intervention. Additionally, at lower temperatures, the voltage supplied to the chip could be safely increased, which also improved the instruction rate—again, with no additional configuration.<p>Amazing.

And the other day I ended up putting together a larger shopping cart of misc items and every single one was cheaper on jet than on amazon.  I have noticed that in the last year I could find things just slightly cheaper elsewhere than Amazon, but when I factored in the convenience and shipping cost amazon usually won.  So this cart full of stuff that was all cheaper than amazon was a bit surprising.  For the pile of random stuff I seem to order every month or two I might just be looking to use Jet first in the future.  They don&#x27;t yet have the breadth of Amazon, but I was surprised at what they have which is what feels like a ton more than when I checked them out six months ago.  For random disposable staples like diapers, batteries, super glue, pens, etc I don&#x27;t have any real loyalty to any one retailer over another, but once I there I will probably keep re-ordering these for a while so as long as they are near the cheapest I&#x27;ll stick around.<p>Oh and Jet&#x27;s search works.  I started writing up a comparison and grabbed quaker popped as my random selection choice and how amazon would have more, but honestly I couldn&#x27;t get amazon&#x27;s search to work to prove it so I was forced to conclude that maybe Jet&#x27;s limited selection is just as good as Amazons. :|  And if anyone from Jet is listening, can you add pepper flavor?",1448508944

Tullio Levi-Civita from Padua, one of the founders of tensor calculus, objected to a major problematic element in this theory, which reflected its global problem: its field equations were restricted to an adapted coordinate system. Einstein proved that his gravitational tensor was a covariant tensor for adapted coordinate systems. In an exchange of letters and postcards that began in March 1915 and ended in May 1915, Levi-Civita presented his objections to Einstein&#x27;s above proof. Einstein tried to find ways to save his proof, and found it hard to give it up. Finally Levi-Civita convinced Einstein about a fault in his arguments. However, only in spring 1916, long after Einstein had abandoned the 1914 theory, did he finally understand the main problem with his 1914 gravitational tensor. In autumn 1915 the G\&quot;ottingen brilliant mathematician David Hilbert found the central flaw in Einstein&#x27;s 1914 derivation. On March 30, 1916, Einstein sent to Hilbert a letter admitting, &quot;The error you found in my paper of 1914 has now become completely clear to me&quot;.",1448506895

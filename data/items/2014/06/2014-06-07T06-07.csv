What is to prevent a process from reading the initial predicate==0 and then being swapped out for thousands of cycles just before the conditional is executed?  I presume the solution for this is that the &quot;write side&quot; does CAS before it actually executes the block.  But since it&#x27;s doing this anyway, I don&#x27;t see how the &#x27;cpuid&#x27; is actually helping things.  I think the CAS will be doing a read-to-own whether or not it succeeds, and thus it should never see the wrong state.<p>Edit:  Looking at the comments in the source through the link that Marat supplied below, I&#x27;m now realizing that the (supposed) purpose of the &#x27;cpuid&#x27; is not to prevent double execution of the initialization block, but to prevent the process that performs the initialization from pre-reading a data variable that is not yet initialized.   Since this isn&#x27;t necessary on x86, it seems even more likely the &#x27;cpuid&#x27; is doing anything useful here.",1402122374

What are the required semantics? For CMC, synchronizing with the destination core is probably necessary. Details of how the snooping works aren&#x27;t documented and you probably can&#x27;t rely on particular uarch implementation details anyhow.<p>But -- specifically for DBT, and just a guess -- you&#x27;re trying to avoid an indirection when going between translated blocks/traces, and patching them directly together? Or at least somehow modify blocks/traces already in use by other cores. Then -- at the cost of more memory usage (and icache misses), you might be able to sidestep the IPIs by generating new traces and pushing synchronization up a level to whatever dispatch/map mechanism you use to find translated code.

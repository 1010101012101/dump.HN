Scrum is a great tool for feature-driven development. Kanban is a great tool for continuous tasks. Why not have one team doing Scrum for features and one Kanban for maintenance?

Many important theorems in abstract algebra state properties of Noetherian rings, for instance famous Hilbert' basis theorem states that the ring of polynomials over Noetherian rings is Noetherian itself.  Other important theorem, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is frequently proved using a tool called Noether normalisation lemma. Because of that,  Noetherian rings, algebras and modules are crucial to many subfields of algebra and algebraic geometry.<p>One of her other insights, which is especially important in the field I'm interested in, was to notice that homology forms a group -- this led to explosion of new results and marked the beginning of one of the most important and influential field in XX century math, algebraic topology, as we see it today.",1332838398

In general, when one works out the design (as has been apparent many times from personal and anecdotal experiences) well in advance before writing code</i><p>Can't agree with this advice. Figuring out the design before writing code is not going to work because you simply don't understand the problem well enough before you try to implement the solution. It is that first prototype that helps you gain knowledge, discover practical use cases, prioretize features, etc. The design that you ""figure out"" without writing any code will most likely be inadequate.<p>The thing is - you want to minimize the amount of code you end up with, <i>not</i> the net amount of code you write along the way.<p>PS.

Being able to swap the product backlog can help correct planning errors, but it doesn't make planning skills obsolete. What it does, though, is to assign an exact responsability for planning errors (sunken costs through unneeded functionality are the product owner's fault, changes in plans that are not realized yet are not realized).<p>Many important things in a Scrum process can be achieved through the definition of what is ""done"". If you know for sure what parts need to be optimized, then optimizing them may be part of getting them ""done"". If you don't, then there is no point in pointlessly optimizing the whole system where only a fraction of these optimizations will be useful and the rest of them just make the code less readable.",1332837458

3760569,comment,3760275,3760536,3,0,kinleyd,,,"I tend to agree that using a down vote to express disagreement eventually isn't constructive. I've seen a number of posts that didn't say anything objectionable or controversial, nor were meaningless in the context of the discussion, and yet were down modded.<p>My theory is that while the risk of being down modded on HN is a helpful factor in keeping discussions more courteous than on an out-and-out anonymous forum, the same cannot be said of down votes, which are in fact anonymous. As a result, users tend to be more careless or perhaps even callous in the use of down votes. I'm not sure what the solution is though: making down votes transparent might help in creating a bit more discreetness in their use, but might spill things over into flame wars into the comments themselves when exercised. Still, I think it's the total anonymity that causes its over use.<p>@DanBC: I think your suggestion for agree, disagree, etc. provides better granularity to the process. Strong up vote for you.",1332836321

I haven't tested this, but wonder if the browser would be smart enough to prioritise loading of the different images depending on the visibility.<p>Otherwise you could generate those parts of the SVG as required, and use the load event to only swap the display to the more appropriate version of an image once loaded.. hence as you zoom the display, you first get the ""core"" image/shapes etc simply scaled by the browser, and then as background images are loaded, these scaled versions are replaced by more appropriate versions.<p>This would match the way that zooming works with tiles in apps like Google maps - when you first zoom in you simply get the base tile images scaled by the browser, and then replaced by the more detailed versions as they're loaded.",1332836311

There's probably some out there already that are very beginner friendly.<p>2) Some kind of REPL/IDE like browser extension to make it easy to dive in right away.

2236186,comment,2235349,2235797,0,0,crocowhile,,,"If I remember correctly you studied math, didn't you? Competition for a job in math is way lower than it is for biological sciences. The reason is that the current model of a successful biology lab is that of a PI leading a number of students and postdocs anywhere from 5 to 20. There is NO WAY that all of them are going to find a job in academia. Germany alone produces in one year the same number of PhDs as there are professors in the country. Ratios are not very different in UK and US. Most of the competition happens in the biological sciences: you can run math or CS research by yourself. Difficult to do the same in biology.<p>I've written about it here: <a href=""http://gilest.ro/2010/what-has-changed-in-science-and-what-must-change/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gilest.ro/2010/what-has-changed-in-science-and-what-m...</a>",1298048389

That is usually a sign you can't argue my point.<p>I'm saying, $87 a year out of my taxes is a tiny amount when you consider what you pay for other things. How much do you spend a year on defense? Since the effective tax rate is around 30% (roughly) and the defense budget is around 20% of the federal budget (roughly), I pay around 52x more for defense than for helping homeless people in a given year. Is defense 52x more important than social services? And I say this being a defense contractor who entire livelyhood depends on taxes and the military industrial complex.",1298048363

There are those who are simply in a difficult situation and are intent to drive themselves back to, or become part of the middle class.<p>There are those, which I wish were given a more logical and critical eye, who will never attain employment. There are also those (many) homeless who are mentally ill. These people are often categorized as the <i>unfortunate</i>, but more often than not are simply disenfranchised with the society we've created. For the homeless who are mentally ill, disabled or otherwise unable to hold employment it is critical that we take a different approach. A long term, critical-thinking approach. Present the numbers to the population. The math is remarkably simple if you take the time to understand the people and their relationships with commonplace society.<p>The right-leaning tend to worry about conversations like this, fearing it will stir up laziness and cause mass exodus of labor force. While there may likely be a percentage of that, the overall outcome would certainly be less homelessness, less crime, less strain on the public system and in the end a better economy for all.",1298048027

It's common for there to be a sort of ""lab"" mentality, with a lot of grad-student cogs in a famous-professor-lab machine, and credit tends to go to the head of the lab (especially if the paper has 50 authors or something, as is common in some areas). Partly that's because it takes a lot of money to set up a physics/chem/bio lab, and there is a lot of grunt-work to be done.<p>That's less common in CS, I think.

2236019,comment,2235507,2235507,0,0,f1gm3nt,,,"I've been working with php for about 10 years now. I have to say that I really enjoy frameworks. They make my job a lot easier. Before I started using frameworks I already built one of my own without realizing it.<p>To start off with I had my own classes to make tasks a little easier. Most php applications deal with a database of some sort, because of that I created a database class that helped me connect to a database and get the information I need. Same with templates. I used smarty since I didn't see a need in making my own. I had my own directory structure and config files for everything. When I was working on a site that needed something was usually when my 'framework' got updated.<p>Then I started reading about frameworks. I have used most frameworks in one way or another. The one that I prefer over other php frameworks is symfony (symfony-project.com). Why? They use doctrine as an ORM. They already have best practices built in. It's not as 'bloated' as other frameworks. Take CodeIgniter for example. Then go take a look at Kohana (which is a stripped down version of it). Once version 2 comes out they will have PHPUnit bundled with it. They use existing open source software instead of reinventing the wheel and making one for that framework only.<p>What is the benefit to you as a php programmer to use a php framework? There are a lot of things to take into consideration when creating a web application such as security. Are you escaping user input before you use that input in a MySQL query? What about user session management? There is more to consider, but hopefully you should get the idea. You start to see yourself repeating the same code after awhile so you start making classes or functions that make your job easier.<p>Should you use php without a framework? You can, but you will essential be creating your own after awhile. IMO it's best just to research a few different ones and find the one that best suits your needs since you can leave the framework development to other guys while you focus on creating a site. For me, symfony best fits my needs. Others may want to check out CakePHP or other frameworks. I never cared for Zend Framework, but use the zend library.",1298046304

2235997,comment,2235507,2235507,0,0,giberson,,,"Of course you <i>can</i>.<p>But in my experience, frameworks are a natural progression of <i>good</i> coding.<p>My first several dozen websites were ""from scratch"" without any boiler plate code. Every page was it's own PHP file, every page had its own HTML hard coded inside of it--the layout of the site repeated dozens of times. Then I said, this is really dumb! If I want to change an element of the layout I have to edit all these pages every single time. I wish I just had a single file to edit... So my next revisions where every page again it's own PHP file, but this time the HTML layout was split into header / footer HTML and I used handy require methods. Ahah! So much time an effort saved in upkeep--yay. Then I was like, ""Wow, theres a lot of similar code needed at the top of every file--stuff to get all my classes included, stuff to setup my database properties, etc. Man I wish I could do all that in one file and just maintain that.."" So I did just that, from then on I started coding my sites with a bootstrap PHP file, a single include at the top of every page to set everything up, and the rest of the page handled area specific code.<p>Thats how my own personal experience with PHP kept evolving, I kept realizing inefficiencies and coming up with patterns to alleviate those lacking areas. I ended up coding simple switch case index pages that would call defined functions that represented web pages. I even created my own template classes that would load a file and replace keywords in it with parameter values. I had naturally tended towards controller driven websites, using the MVC pattern on my own without ever having actually known that it was the Model View Controller pattern. To me, it had become just the obvious way to do things. Of course my own implementations where rough, and not reusable, they were flawed with limitations.<p>Eventually, I decided to look into frameworks--luckily it was at that time that Zend framework was coming into it's own. It was at version 0.7. I started reading the documentation and I was blown away because I kept seeing all these features that it provided and they were features that ran parallel with my own development designs. The framework had been what I was looking for, a polished implementation of a development paradigm that I had intuitively developed on my own. The thing about the framework code base is that it is designed with a text book like knowledge of solidly defined patterns. That's what freed it from all the flaws and limitations of my own implementations. Instead the framework solutions were abstracted, and brimmed with potential of being augmented and extended--allowing them to be robust enough to fulfill typical use cases and yet capable of being molded to fit special needs and requirements.<p>To me, it seems like when ever there is a framework article with a mostly con attitude, I can't help but think the article is being written from the perspective of someone who has not fully been through the ""from scratch"" phase. More likely, they started with frameworks. It's easy to understand why there would be such a jerk neck reaction when abruptly approaching a framework without a from scratch background. Without the background, all the robustness, all the complexity, there is no frame of reference for it. Such people don't comprehend the need or usefulness of those solutions. Instead, they have this preconception that frameworks ""claim to do everything"" and yet for some reason you have to actually code and implement special cases so why bother with the learning curve in the first place if you were going to have to come up with your own solutions. So often I have to reiterate that frameworks don't do everything--they aren't suppose to, they cant! They are the boiler plate, they are the starting point. They take care of the simple basic things that way you can devote your time to addressing the interesting, hard stuff. It may feel like it wastes more time than it saves--but thats just because you have to learn it first. Obviously theres a learning curve, obviously theres an initial time investment. The point is, after that initial investment there is so much payoff. Of course your first site, and your first framework are going to be hellish on effort. But your 3rd, or your 4th you'll have a basic site up and running in 2 minutes and be free to spend the rest of your time working on the unique core features that will make your site glorious and awesome.<p>The god awful truth of it all, is that web development really isn't <i>easy</i>. There is no magic wand to wave that will grant you the perfect site from a wish. There is no ultimate does everything tool that requires no skill to use. There is, and always will be a time investment required. Smart, successful developers will invest that time requirement into understanding and utilizing frameworks--that investment will be fruitful and multiply.",1298046007

Musicians, writers, inventors, athletes, research scientists, pilots, and even small business owners all have the same career path.  A few really driven, really lucky ones win the lottery and get to be household names.  A small minority (maybe 1 - 5%) make an upper middle class living.  The other 99% work for poor wages until they give up or get used up.  It sucks, but it's hardly unique to science.  If you're in a profession with a massive oversupply of labor, you can pretty much be guaranteed to see this kind of structure.<p>I also spent half the article thinking that the author's struggles with vocabulary and grammar might explain his/her struggles to get ahead.  Perhaps he/she is a non-native speaker and that's adding to the trouble?",1298044849

And it is a city where number of crime bosses, criminal geniuses and psychopaths exist, and where they can act fairly freely.<p>Gotham was created for batman IMHO and not vice-versa.  If someday batman dies, spiderman won't come from New York for load balancing.  Why is that almost all the super-heroes have their arch-enemy in their nearby locality.  They also share the same trait.  For example spiderman villains are mostly mutants and nagraj villains are mostly snake which takes humanoid form.",1298044841

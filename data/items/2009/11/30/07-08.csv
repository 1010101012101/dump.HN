Dawkins did INVENT the concept (or at least the name) meme so this article surely has relevance if you are interested in memes. I agree with you on his religion bashing. He created this concept mainly to attack religions by equating them with viruses. It is interesting though that he overplays the beneficial part of computer viruses while downplaying the beneficial part of religion. The line between parasite and symbiosis is fuzzy. Even organisms like dwarf tapeworms can help people by reducing allergies so surely religion has done some good.",1259567741

It's very much a work in progress and has a long way to go, but I'm excited about getting the community involved early on. I'm working on a public feedback mechanism, but for now please post feedback below this comment.<p>I've been using Google Wave to build the plot and outline, together with my friends TheColonial (<a href=""http://buffered.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buffered.io/</a>) and StackingIt (<a href=""http://www.blog.stackingit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blog.stackingit.com/</a>). Wave rocks as a real-time review system, and has definitely improved the quality of my book.<p>I'll have a more substantial website up in the next week or so that will have a comments section and an RSS feed for updates. In the mean time you can follow @erlangforskeptics or myself @lukevenediger on twitter.<p>Thanks again,\nLuke Venediger",1259567699
967505,comment,967340,967340,0,0,coffeemug,,,"Sure it's easy to come up with ideas, but it's much harder to come up with ideas that are good. If this list was vetted, I have a feeling it would be significantly shorter.<p>For example, #2: ""Incubator site providing office space, hosting, etc. for startups that are seed funded."" Unless you franchise it, this isn't scalable at all. It's <i>an</i> idea, perhaps even a business idea, but it's not a <i>startup</i> idea.<p>Or, #9: ""Herbal Flavored Gum. MMM...rosemary."" I don't know much about the flavored gum industry, but I would imagine their margins are razor thin. It's not really a <i>startup</i> idea as there is no innovation here, and no opportunity to improve the margins (well, may be there is an opportunity, but it's not at all evident from the description).<p>Coming up with this list in such a fashion is definitely an interesting exercise and I applaud Seth for doing it, but the quality of the ideas is a bit underwhelming. Perhaps if they had to elaborate a bit on the descriptions and do some basic analysis, it would be a lot more interesting.",1259567686
967503,comment,967340,967340,0,0,chrischen,,,"Every time someone says something about ideas being less important than execution I feel like he/she is oversimplifying it (I'm not saying the author of the post is missing the point though) and someone out there is missing the <i>idea</i>.<p>Initial, untested ideas are worthless. The list of 998 ideas are probably all things they just came up with on the spot, unexposed to the effects of evolution.<p>But let's say we took this idea, ""Prepackaged school supplies based on the lists from the school districts,"" tested it. The test would have to consist of some sort of execution. Now we let's say we found out that no one gives a shit about school supplies and don't buy it anyways. Well now we amend our original idea. We have a new idea, it's still an idea. We executed to determine what works and what doesn't. This new idea is worth slightly more. After many, many iterations, we'll still have an idea in the end. If it is carefully documented and proven with a history of execution. This idea <i>is</i> worth something, and I <i>would</i> buy it. The idea, <i>only after execution</i> has value because the execution is factual proof.<p>Therefore, ideas <i>can</i> be worth something and <i>can</i> be sold. In fact, the <i>idea</i>, plan, knowledge, whatever you call it, is what's worth something in the end. What's worthless is an untested idea, because it is grounded only in imagination.<p>Also every time you execute an idea, it becomes exposed. It loses it's value because it is free (unless you patent it, but that's just some artificial thing we invented to force value into ideas after they are exposed). But the idea, before anyone else knows about it, and in the instant it is executed, has value.<p>Of course this means that more important than any single idea is in the ability of the person to come up with innovative ideas. We can all follow the model of evolution and improve our ideas, but who can iterate faster, and predict more accurately what works (guiding evolution), will ultimately dominate.<p>Execution is simply how well you predict what works, and how well you don't lie to yourself. In this sense execution may be more important than any single idea, but an idea can still have value.",1259567659

967494,comment,954677,962193,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"""But the full hypothesis is 'Given the data, are girls better than boys at this exam?' and clearly, the prior probability is relevant.""<p>No, prior probabilities have nothing to do with it.<p>We state our 'null' hypothesis that the boys and girls do equally well.  This hypothesis has nothing to do with a belief of prior probabilities or belief of any probabilities at all.  Instead, we state this hypothesis as something that will give us some mathematical assumptions to do some calculations to reject it and, then, conclude that it was false.<p>Generally in hypothesis testing we don't believe the null hypothesis as prior probabilities; indeed, likely we don't believe it at all and are stating it to reject it and conclude it is false.<p>In more detail, we assume that 20 boys and 18 girls are 38 independent samples from some one distribution.  It turns out, we don't need to say anything about that distribution because we are being 'distribution-free'.  In particular, we get to ignore the Gaussian distribution.  GOOD.<p>Independent?  Okay:  Suppose we DO give you the true distribution of the data and the first 37 scores.  Now you get to guess score 38.  Do the 37 scores help you beyond just the distribution?  No.  Same for any subset of the scores.  Then, we have independence.<p>With this null hypothesis, the average of the scores of the 20 boys and the average of the scores of the 18 girls should be 'close'.  How close?  Well, under the null hypothesis and with the values we observed, we have a way to proceed:  The distribution of the difference in the scores, with everything we do know given and fixed, we can find.  For this distribution, basically we look at all the 33 billion or so differences obtained by taking all combinations of 38 things taken 18 at a time.  Justification?  If work at it mathematically, then under the null hypothesis can show that each of those 33 billion cases was equally probable.<p>Then we pick a small number, say, 1% for the size of our Type I error, that is, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.<p>Then we find the differences in the 1% tail of the 33 billion differences.<p>Then we look at the difference from our actual data.  That difference will be one of the 33 billion.  We see if that difference is in the 1% tail.<p>If the difference is in the 1% tail, then one of two things is true:<p>(A) The null hypothesis is true, the boys and girls are the same, that is, independent samples from the same distribution, and with our actual data the difference is relatively large, out in a tail, and we have observed something that happens only 1% of the time.<p>(B) The null hypothesis is false, that is, in some way the boys and girls are different.  That is, we still believe the independence assumption, so what is false is just that the mean for the boys is different from the mean for the girls.<p>If the 1% is so small we don't believe (A), then we conclude (B).<p>Variance has nothing to do with it.<p>Welcome to distribution-free 'two sample' hypothesis testing 101.",1259566360

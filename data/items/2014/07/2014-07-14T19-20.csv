Have been drinking EM (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_microorganism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_microorganism</a>) every day for the past 6 months which has improved my digestion a lot.<p>Thought this comment on the NPR article was really insightful:<p>There&#x27;s so much more to developing a healthy microbiome than just eating yogurt and drinking kombucha, as many people like to claim. It starts at birth. As you travel through the birth canal, you come into contact with many different and important microorganisms through contact with your mother&#x27;s vaginal fluids and even fecal matter. If you&#x27;re born via C section, you&#x27;re starting out at a disadvantage. Then breastfeeding is the next step. Mother&#x27;s milk is where you get your next dose of a very broad spectrum of microorganisms. Then throughout life, as you come in contact with other people, you eat dirt, you hang around farm animals, etc, these are all mother nature&#x27;s way of helping you develop that microbiome, which is essentially the core of your immune system. Eating is important too, and one of the biggest problems with our modern food system is that everything is pasteurized, cooked all the way through, sterilized, irradiated, etc. All of the healthy microorganisms that used to exist are being killed.<p>So the point here is that people need to rethink many of their lifestyle choices if they want to heal their guts. Every time you take an antibiotic, you likely suffer much collateral damage because you may be permanently killing beneficial species that you may never be exposed to again. They don&#x27;t exist in yogurt or kombucha. Either that, or consider fecal bacteriotherapy (fecal transplants) since it seems to be one of the the most promising new approaches to healing microbiomes. ~Julie Latham",1405365877

Not just because there are also processes, rpc, Node like async and similar strategies one can use (including APIs like Apple&#x27;s GCD), but because it&#x27;s not really about getting top speed, or most of the apps doesn&#x27;t even come close to saturate 20% of a single core.<p>And there&#x27;s always the graphic card for DSP and parallelism -- where it doesn&#x27;t matter that much if your language has immutable variables or not, because you&#x27;ll use CUDA etc for that.",1405365601

Or at least it would, if competition weren&#x27;t illegal. There&#x27;s nothing &quot;natural&quot; about the monopolies we have now.<p>And even if it turns out that a single network is the best arrangement, it should still be possible for municipalities to choose to own their own last mile fiber and buy transit at competitive rates. Which is also generally illegal in most of the US, thanks to the lobbying efforts of the big incumbents.<p>And it&#x27;s also absurd that we&#x27;re still letting analog-era regulations govern our use of wireless spectrum.

It counts each character as 1 on the front-end (countdown from 140 to -infinity), but counts the BYTES on the backend, so the front end will say you are under the limit, but then you click update and get an error message saying you are over the limit.<p>So, this idea is DOA.",1232077799

You know anyone else who sells a million bucks in something with 50 visitors a day? The numbers do a lot to illustrate the opportunity.<p>If the guy gets mad at me, so be it. But if these numbers were really a secret, he shouldn't have told them to a random guy on the phone.<p>I also don't think there's any harm in relating what he told me - maybe he'll get someone to help him because of it.",1232077736

Internet people get all worked up into a lather when they discover that, say, some machine somewhere in Microsoft's network is running Apache/Unix or OSX (OMG!).

436120,comment,436053,436071,0,0,jwilliams,,,"<i>Investors, on the other hand, do care about patents.</i><p>This is one reason to keep patents provisional as long as possible - you get the investors to cover the capital outlay of executing the patent.<p>If you launch into the WIPO ""International Patent"" process, for an upfront cost (US$5k or so - varies a lot on circumstances) you can extend the process by quite a bit - up to 18 months iirc.

He pretty much copied the entire game design from Worms. So basically, he didn't even create the element that attracts the users in the first place.<p>He was smart to create a Lite version, so maybe he is intuitive about marketing. That's hard to say from one example.<p>He got lucky, but didn't realize that he did (apparently the app store environment is rather arbitrary). He thinks he has lots of talent at things he didn't design, so he went all-in by quitting his job. Now, he spends his afternoons watching Judge Judy (or as the article says.)<p>Yes, he knows how to write code. That's about all I can infer.<p>On top of that, he makes rash decision, lacks hindsight, spends his afternoons doing useless activities.<p>Now I don't know him. I'm sure he's a good guy. I just think the publicity he got was rather negative for his future.<p>But hey, any publicity is good publicity, right?",1232076345

436105,comment,436053,436071,0,0,goodgoblin,,,"Thanks - kind of what I was hoping someone would say.  Our lawyer is a bit of a salesman, not really, but it amounts to as much, him saying ""if you don't do X, Y Z bad things might happen."" but we are thinking, it would mean we are in a good position if we do get sued for patent infringement or whatever down the road if someone else goes for this, etc.  It kind of feels like an insurance policy that we can't afford for a set of circumstances that don't seem all that likely.<p>Totally agree on the focus issue, my partner is spending all her time stressing about this b/c the clock is ticking and I ended up reading a bunch of patents the other day as well instead of focusing on the product.<p>Thanks for a business perspective - we are new to this so I really do appreciate your thoughts on the subject.",1232075948

436100,comment,435192,435493,0,0,patio11,,,"There is a social institution in some countries where tea is consumed in the afternoon and, importantly, this comes with a societal expectation that work stops during the consumption of tea.  The societal expectation is similar to the expectation in the US that most professionals are not available for productive labor between 12:00 and 1:00 because they will be eating lunch.<p>Thus, when an American company says they're instituting afternoon tea-times, what they mean is they are adding a break to the workday which is not typically present in American companies.  When an American company which previously had afternoon tea-time eliminates it, it means that the workers have lost a socially acceptable period in which they were not expected to labor.",1232075677

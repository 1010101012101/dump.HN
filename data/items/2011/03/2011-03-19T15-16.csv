2343886,story,,,6,14,robinwarren,"Ask HN: Simplest way to start paying people?",,"Hi Folks,<p>I'm working on something and wondering what the quickest way to get setup to be able to pay people money would be. Basically I'll be taking money of one group (probably businesses) and then paying some of that money to others (probably individuals). I'm wondering what the simplest way to get a proof of concept up would be for the paying money to individuals part. Can I just require everyone to have a PayPal account? Or would something else be easier/better.<p>If anyone has a recommendation as to the best way to do this as opposed to the quickest way I'd be interested in hearing that as well, thanks.<p>Robin<p>==edit==
Ok, trying to be more specific. 
What would be the easiest way technically speaking to arrange payments from a webapp to individuals? And are there any.specific gotchas to be aware of.<p>Thanks for the help.<p>== Edit 2 ==
Payments will be 10s or $100s",1300550370

2343880,comment,2343330,2343409,0,0,bluesnowmonkey,,,"Sure.<p>Their site has a front-end controller (www/dispatch.php) to which all requests get routed (by a mod_rewrite rule, perhaps), rather than having .php files in the web root for each page.  This file sets up the environment -- among other things, it registers a custom error handler and includes a config file (config/config.php) that defines a bunch of constants.  Then it dispatches the request to the appropriate controller, based on the URL.<p>Someone (probably a sysadmin) edited the config file and accidentally changed the opening tag (<?php).  This caused PHP to output its contents, rather than parsing and executing it.  Since there was no output buffer active, those contents were sent directly to the user, which caused HTTP response headers also to be sent automatically.  That's the big first line you see in the output.<p>Since no error had actually been triggered by this point, execution continued.  It tried to set an HTTP header (""P3P: CP=""P3P_CP"""", whatever that means).  However since HTTP headers had already been sent, this did trigger an error, which was passed to the custom error handler, which sent some debug output (the rest of the output you see) and stopped execution.",1300550263

This is a different error - the file was executed by PHP, but since they mangled the opening tag (i?php instead of <?php) it was passed through as HTML by the PHP interpreter.<p>Except for the obvious – never edit files on the live server – other ways to protect against this would be to have multiple opening tags (first line of file would just be <?php ?>, then another opening tag on the second line), have your VCS check that certain files begin with <?php, store the config in a non-executable way (in a YAML file, or in the server environment), or using a combination of file() and eval() to always prepend the '<?php'.<p>And people should really install a PHP error handler first thing - before they load anything else - that delivers errors with a HTTP code 5xx they can catch in their caching layer.",1300550139

Alas, I'm in New York and would not leave the city lightly: family and friends.

At a startup, you get a mix of interesting work and shitty grunt work that has to be done, and there's nothing personal about it because everyone is getting about the same quality of work, and because doing the grunt work is well worth it if the startup pays off. In a big company, you can end up in an AI/machine learning research group with high autonomy... or you can end up maintaining some shitty legacy payroll system.<p>But yes, I would consider a job at another startup.

You need to take stock of what you've done these past 3 years. How are you different today from when you started? THAT is your ""career credit"", and you need to figure out how to communicate that to a big company. You probably have a ton of management skills (project management, people management, time management, etc). Big companies like that.<p>3. There's NOTHING wrong with going to work for a big company. Big company = stability, and after a long roller coaster ride with daily uncertainty, that can be appealing. You can always start over if it turns out you're stuck with the entrepreneurial bug ;-)<p>The key to being an entrepreneur is failing fast, right? You're 3 years in and haven't launched. Why? Do you know what your customers want? Because once you build what they actually want, no matter how crappy your first launch (within reason), you'll have the opposite problem of not being able to retain enough talent to keep up with their demands. You'll be constantly inundated with emails to the effect of ""Yeah I really like your product, but it'd be so much better if it did X...""
Failing is not just the CEO's decision; it's EVERYBODY'S decision. YOU are an entrepreneur, too. Use your spidey sense!<p>And make sure you're honest about it when you talk to your CEO. If you can't come to common ground, that's too bad, but if you CAN, you might turn this around yet.<p>Also: Read up on Founder's Syndrome if you haven't yet: <a href=""http://managementhelp.org/misc/founders.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://managementhelp.org/misc/founders.htm</a><p>Edit: And if you're an Android or iPhone developer who's interested in education and games and lives in the bay area, forget everything I just said.

But if you must know, we are both university students that were working on a web.app / managing a really heavy course load at a good named university that has a harsh-ish course load and we are also involved in planning a conference in April which was/is a huge time suck with small advantages. This didn't leave much time for the idea lest at the cost of our health and more sleep deprivation.

We really could launch in a couple of days to a week, but that would not be feasible time wise, we are however debating still going ahead with the idea in a couple of months from now, and I believe that since TSF is already doing a great job, people might be reluctant to accept another alternative or feed it with stories /tips (sorry for the pessimism) once another alternative has been executing on that idea for a couple of months.<p>Please let us know what your thoughts are.

2343776,story,,,102,67,throwaway4921,"Ask HN: I'm considering leaving a startup to look for big-company jobs (really).",,"I know this decision may not be popular around here, but I think the quality of advice that I'll get is good, so I'm going to ask for it. I'm a talented programmer who is now considering <i>leaving</i> a startup and moving back into the big-company fold. My savings are near zero-- that rules out another startup-- and a part of me thinks that a big-company job for a while might not be the worst thing in the world.<p>I've decided to leave a startup in which I was a founder, although the partnership was always a bit unequal (I'm the youngest and don't have any contacts to potential customers or VCs) and our CEO often takes the attitude of it being a one-man show (i.e. he tends to get ""set"" in decisions without appeal, he makes shitty comments if we take a long lunch, and we deal with 2-4 status checks per day). I've been treated enough like an employee that my motivation has crashed and I essentially am ""just an employee"" at this point. I don't have a sense of authorship over my work. At which point, why am I continuing to work for low pay? If the major benefit of being at a startup is autonomy, and I don't have that, then what the fuck am I doing?<p>It's been almost 3 years, and we haven't failed, but we haven't launched or secured funding yet and ""just around the corner"" syndrome has been ongoing ever since I started. I don't think our CEO would lie, but I can't trust his perception that things are ""just about to heat up"" because he's been wrong on that matter for so long.<p>I don't think, for the record, that our lack of success (to this point) is the CEO's fault, and it's definitely not mine: I'm just a developer. I'd prefer to leave details out, but we expended a lot of energy chasing features for customers who flaked on us, or that would/might appeal to VCs, and hence we are at Year 3 and have a lot of cool code but no minimum viable product.<p>I feel a bit disloyal and selfish for considering quitting, but I also feel like it's what I need to do. It's my career and I need to be selfish.<p>I also know that established, large companies aren't held in high regard here and I share that prejudice. On the other hand, I think large-company jobs, even if they don't lead to nine-figure exits, <i>can</i> turn out well. My view of large company jobs is this: sure, the default is to get bad projects and not learn much, in which case one leaves after 8-24 months for greener pastures; but they're great if someone powerful taps you as protege, favors you in project allocation, and makes you a ""made man"" (or ""made woman"") in the company. In other words, ""startup"" and ""big company"" are just two games with good and bad possible outcomes, with more variance in the startup scenario and, in both, with the ""good"" outcome being somewhat rare (1/5) and the ""bad"" being the norm. The career game is just about spinning the wheel, repeatedly, until you actually win. And I think it's time for another spin.<p>The question: what does leaving a startup-- one that a future employer won't have heard of-- do for (or to) one's career? Is it right for me to expect ""career credit"" for the 3 years I spent? Or am I fucked in that regard? Strategically, what should I be doing to maximize my chances of getting a <i>decent</i> big-company job? Also, what is the programmer job market like? When I last looked around (2008) it was horrendous. Has it improved?",1300547993

2343736,comment,2343296,2343296,0,0,ilamont,,,"If you asked most reporters whether they used primary sources, they would say yes, and point to the interviews that they conduct.<p>But if you were to point out that primary sources also includes published research, almost to a man or woman they would say A) they don't have the time to read it B) they don't have access to the journals or C) they are not aware the research exists. A few  might concede D) even if they had access, they wouldn't be able to understand the research, which points to the fact that most journalists didn't major in science/technology in college and academic writing can be difficult to penetrate.<p>Of the above factors, I think C presents an opportunity for academics and startup publishers. On the academic side, it's pretty clear that the traditional method of reaching out to reporters via press releases and personal contacts is becoming less viable as newsrooms cut staff and the remaining writers have less time to network/talk with sources (travel budgets to attend conferences are very restricted these days) and write up stories based on those encounters.<p>Some researchers have seized upon blogging as a great way to not only reach their peers, but also a wider audience, and of course, other media (including journalists, specialist blogs, etc.). Group blogs written by researchers and experts are another great way to highlight new research and discuss ideas, too. Terra Nova ( <a href=""http://terranova.blogs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terranova.blogs.com/</a> ) is one example focused on virtual worlds; I am sure the audience here knows of many others.<p>But the problem with individual and group blogs is they are still largely unknown outside of a relatively small group of people. In order to make a mass audience connection, there needs to be a way for these ideas to be presented in newspapers and television reports (which is how many people still learn about the world around them), or on media websites.<p>An arrangement to republish blog content or for the blog authors to prepare easy-to-understand summary reports for a mass media audience are possibilities, but the processes and incentives need to be worked out -- preferably in a way that takes the load off of editors, who don't have the time to find the right bloggers and deal with the freelance contracts and payment issues. One startup idea would be to create a ""marketplace"" to match publishers who are seeking an informed report about a specific scientific topic (for instance, how a boiled water reactor works). Another avenue for a startup would be to set up a ""science wire service"" which prepares timely, relevant coverage (including blogs, video, and features) about new research and developments every day. Media companies could subscribe to the service and editors could browse the service and use as much as they like, just as they do with Reuters, Bloomberg, AP, etc.<p>As for the specific issue of not including links, this partly relates to the awareness and access issues mentioned above, but also to the fact that content management systems used at many newspapers and magazines are optimized for print publishing, not online publishing. Inserting links typically has to be done <i>after</i> the article has been written, often by different editors or producers who know how to use Wordpress/Drupal/homegrown tools. I think there's a startup opportunity here as well, but unfortunately it also requires a rethinking of newsroom processes and control.",1300546830

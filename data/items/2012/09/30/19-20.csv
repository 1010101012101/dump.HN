I know people who have left because of the inertia at some banks - systems don't improve and ""workarounds"" are the norm. Retail banks that aren't risk driven can have horrific IT.\nBut there are reasons to stay in - plenty of institutions manage to be places you can have a lifelong career at, they won't lay you off and you can do relatively interesting work. That is the flip side of the personal risk the author talks about. These places don't pay $400k. And especially don't do obscene bonuses - but they don't treat you like dirt either.\nHalf the reason they don't get mentioned often is that people don't leave very often, there isn't scandal associated with the companies.

If I were to take a trip to Tokyo, I would want to spend a lot of my time eating at Japanese restaurants, meeting new people and hanging out at Japanese bars, and just experiencing what life is like for the average person who lives there. And honestly, for that sort of travel, this service could be really cool.<p>On another level, it's even useful for finding the parts of a city you've never seen before.

Sadly, here, as elsewhere, the audience which is most likely to get into the ""Game"" most completely are those that have the lowest prospects to start with, and a few tricks are not going to change someone with no social skills into Prince Charming in a matter of sessions.<p>That said, although I have more or less agreed with you with regards to the 'social stunted' part (as a generalization) 'negging' is not particularly targeted at the emotionally damaged who respond to being put down. It is a tactic charged at the supremely confident, attractive girl who is used to blowing off guys who approach her. The 'neg' is, consequently, first and foremost, an expression of confidence by the person who is approaching her. He is not approaching her as a fawning wretch, but someone who thinks of himself as her equal or even superior.<p>That this can be a turn on of sorts, esp. when contrasted with the usual types of social interaction encountered by very attractive women at bars and clubs, should be obvious.

The web has its origins in the world of research and academia where most publications have at most 2 columns and usually only one. The current ""newspaper/magazine"" trend and the challenges associated with it and large display sizes are quite recent.<p>2. In the early 90s, the average display size was 800x600. At that size, a line of text set at 14px contained roughly 100 characters. Nobody really felt the need for shorter lines. Besides, newspapers don't lay out their content in columns because of legibility concerns but because it makes cutting and moving (parts of) articles easier an improves the general flexibility of their composition. And that's good for advertising, too.<p>3. Back to the origins of the web, one of the main design goals of its creator was to create a medium that was as independant of the client as possible. From that point of view, columns seem to be quite difficult to execute well. But of course, most of today's web doesn't really fit in their original view.",1349031674

I normally rail against Wall Street precisely because I've been around some of the people who go into the business and seen some shitty attitudes about life, but the call out to a higher calling of doing humanity a necessary and useful service really strikes a chord.<p>In your opinion, are there any trading firms that you feel embody that idea that they should be working to create systems to better allocate capital (instead of, say, gaining  all of the capital for themselves)? I'm attracted to the problems that banks have to solve and deal with, but the culture around the current solutions is incredibly off putting.",1349031670

Existing laws should apply, without needing constant updating (""on the internet"", ""in the holodeck"", ""in the singularity"").<p>I don't agree that he's saying that. The issue is that (leaving DRM circumvention tools aside) standard copyright law doesn't prohibit distribution <i>technologies</i> at all, just infringement. Hollywood doesn't like that -- they want to be in charge of what distribution technologies people are allowed to create, regardless of what they're used for. So their end run around it has two parts: 1) They refuse to sanction the use of the new technology for their own content, and then 2) they argue that because it isn't sanctioned by the major players, substantially all use must be infringing and dissemination of the technology itself (regardless of use) therefore induces that infringement and has no substantial non-infringing use.<p>It isn't about Mickey Mouse and the local mime. Aereo doesn't pick which channels its users watch. Its users can use the technology to watch PBS broadcasts (e.g. of your local mime) that are distributed under Creative Commons or other permissive licenses, or Presidential speeches that as U.S. government works fall immediately into the public domain, or use the technology to record video that the users have negotiated a separate license for with the copyright holders, or make a variety of legal fair uses of the plaintiffs' copyrighted material. Or the users can use it for blatant infringement, e.g. to record sitcoms and burn them to DVDs to sell in the street. But that's all between the copyright holders and the individual users. Aereo is just providing the technology -- and Hollywood is trying to stop the <i>technology</i>, not the infringement.",1349031623

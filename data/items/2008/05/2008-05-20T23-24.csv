195466,comment,195423,195423,0,0,dmpayton,,,"The best answer you will ever recieve on this question is, ""it depends"" -- no one can make the right choice for you.<p><i>It depends on what your experience you have.</i>
If you know Python, use Django. If you know Ruby, use Rails. I know Python, so I use Django. Since you have no experience with either, this one is moot.<p><i>It depends on what you're building.</i>
A lot of people on the net seem to take the position of ""Django is good for content publishing sites, and Rails is good for web apps"", but that has more to do with the applications the two frameworks were derived from than the frameworks capabilities. Realistically, anything you can build in Rails you can build in Django, and vice-versa.<p>Personally, I love Django. It lets me develop quickly and I know how to deploy it properly. I tried setting up Rails no more then three days ago (on Ubuntu), and it wasn't as much fun. I had issues installing the correct version of Ruby, and then Gems didn't want to work.<p>As for you, I'd recommend spending a few days with each framework. Get them both installed and just tinker around. Build a quick CRUD app. After that, you'll have a pretty good idea of which one suits you (and your needs) better",1211327519

This limits your creativity. It goes with the territory, so I'm not complaining here, but large parts of this process are Not Fun.<p>Experiments on the side don't have these issues and allow you to do a little freewheeling. Keeps that whole hacking spirit alive. People without side-projects tend to move into project management, oracle db maintenance or turn into burned-out has-beens after a few years of software development.",1211327088

195460,comment,195410,195410,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"Well, for starters I would just like to say that the design itself is done quite well.  I have always thought that the typography of a website is one of the most important yet overlooked aspects.  The strength of this will come from getting as many users as possible, which makes me wonder for the private alpha.  Are you going to make the beta public?  Also, just a suggestion, but I would actually like an easy way to submit a credible blog to the list (unless I just am not seeing it, which then I would say is a problem).  This would promote the blogging community and allow those who deserve to be heard and use quality and ethical journalism skills to not be lost in all of the noise.",1211326854

I would assume that people who pay a lot of attention to the rake might become a little more loose, since the rake is essentially a tax on hand activity.<p>Looser players would help a poker bot, instead of hurting it, because a poker bot never gets bored, and is content playing winning strategies 100% of the time (i.e. it doesn't feel like it's going to get lucky playing KJ off ""this time"").",1211326520

I'm sick of Reddit, so I'm more than happy to give NewsCred a chance.<p>Some initial nitpicks:<p>- the tour video loops, it's a bit annoying<p>- the credibility score is hidden in the main listings (shows up if highlighting text) - is that intentional?<p>- the up/down buttons next to ""CHOOSE YOUR NEWS SOURCES"" are a bit confusing, at first I thought that was a drop-down<p>- you might want to work on the URLs a bit, shorter and more descriptive is good for both users and SEO, <a href=""http://www.newscred.com/article/list/id/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscred.com/article/list/id/1</a> isn't great<p>- the credibility concept is very interesting, but I'm a bit wary of what constitutes a ""top story"" because I've already been trained to have a ""top story"" mean ""interesting"" (and hopefully, if I'm on the right site, ""interesting to me"").  ""Credible but boring"" isn't very appealing.<p>- can I indicate my personal preference for certain news sources over others? I don't mean this in the sense of ""this source is more credible"", I mean it in the sense of ""I personally want to see more from this source and less from other sources, even if other users might not""<p>- I suspect filtering out duplicates will be essential when dealing with multiple news sources.

195445,comment,195085,195392,0,0,mhartl,,,"Your argument assumes that the same or superior goods couldn't be supplied more efficiently on the market.  After all, the same argument applies to having the government buy people cars (now they can drive to work), hard-hats (now they can work in construction), or food (who can work if they're hungry?).<p>When the government is the monopoly supplier of a good, it's difficult to visualize the world being any other way.  But there are instructive test cases: just look at how much more vibrant religious life is in the absence of a state religion.  (I'm a Pastafarian, BTW. ;-)  Or look at how much scarcer and less varied food is in command economies.<p>Education is tremendously valuable, and there are powerful incentives to unlock that value.

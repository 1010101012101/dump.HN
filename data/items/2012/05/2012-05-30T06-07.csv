This puts pressure on the nerves running down your arm, and for me, this is what caused the most amount of pain, to the point where I was worried my career as a programmer was over.<p>I've discovered that keeping the mouse to the left side of my body (I'm right-handed) and keeping my hand perpendicular to the tabletop as I use the mouse has all but alleviated my back and wrist pain, going on 15 years now.<p>To be clear, I don't hold the mouse normally.  I have both my elbows on the table and keep the mouse almost all the way to my left elbow.  I sort of cradle the mouse with my right hand, with my thumb and index finger on on the left button, and most of my hand on the right side of the mouse so that my hand remains perpendicular to the table.  This mimics how my hand would be if I were writing with a pen, which is a more natural position.<p>I've been programming mostly pain-free ever since 1997 this way.  I even use a regular mouse, I just hold it differently and use a posture that ergonomic specialist would probably reject, but it has completely worked for me.",1338359258

In particular my right hand tends to shift at least one place over compared to typing prose.  I find standard keyboards, not ergonomic ones, accommodate this best.  But the keyboard needs to be at a low, relaxes angle  (on one's lap is best) and ideally a wristpad helps.<p>3)  Mice are the root of most wrist pain!  Ditch the mouse and get a trackball.  This one really is close to universal.  I know a number of others who have found this to be true.<p>4)  Pay attention to your body....  If your wrists are bothering you <i>stop</i> and relax them before proceeding.  Also pay attention to your arms and make sure they are relaxed.  This should be common sense but....<p>5)  If your wrists hurt for more than a little bit, prompt medical attention is a good thing.

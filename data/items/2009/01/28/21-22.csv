The more downvotes to negative values I see, the more I think this community is becoming less able or willing to communicate.<p>Intelligent people should be able to use words to disagree. I see how it can be useful to use upvotes for content filtering, but downvoting to negative scores actually highlights those posts and therefore defeats the content filtering purpose.<p>Greying them out even forces me to take action (highlight the text with the mouse) in order to be able to read them. It's completely counter-productive.<p>So what purpose do downvotes have? In my view they are either insults or they are a very primitve way of expressing opinion. Upvotes are also a very primitive way of expressing opinion, but they help me filter out interesting content as well.<p>Since negative scores serve no purpose at all, why would I want to have those posts thrust in my face? To learn that there are a bunch of speechless people who feel good about making a score go from -8 to -9?

455245,comment,454316,454316,0,0,ardit33,,,"I joined a new company.  about 40 people, semi-startup mode.  \nI was working on larger company (about 220+ ) people, and after going through 6 managers in two years, with the latest being the corporate/pointy hair type, I had enough. I stopped working hard, and I realized I needed to move on doing something more meaningful.  \nSo I joined a small company that is in the beginning of executing a new strategy (yes a gamble, but all startups are).\nI am working extra hard, full cylinders firing.   I believe ""performance = ability + motivation"".  I have both right now, and my work is really showing it.  Here are the main motivators for me:<p>1. Green card and freedom -- The process takes long time, so I need to make sure the company is doing good and it will be around when the process is done, otherwise I will be in trouble. Meaning going the extra mile about everything I do. Meaning that everything I do, is to secure the company is doing well and will be around.   For other people might be their mortgage they have to pay, or expecting kids, or other responsibilities.<p>2. Pay is good. Really good.  --HR types love to say that pay is not a motivator, but I can say for sure that low pay is sure DE-Motivator.\nAnd pay is relative. When everybody else is getting a pay-cut,and I got a huge raise, it makes me motivated to work extra hard to make the money they are paying worth it. And honestly, a large pay, makes me feel more appreciated.<p>3. Visibility and work relevance -- I make a huge difference in this company.  I am about 10% of the technical output of the company.  I work in very important project, and my direct performance has a lot of say on the future of the company.  When you are one of one hundred engineers, your direct performance matters less. You can slack off (work half the time), and it only affects .5% of the engineering output.  When you are one of the 12 engines, there is a huge responsibility on your shoulders.<p>4. Management hears what I say.  -- If you are good, you can truly excel and shine in small companies/startups. My manager and director are impressed by what I am doing, and they hear my feedback, and act on it accordingly.  I am not just a cog, replaceable widget, but a important part of the company.  Replaceable, (yes, everybody is), but at a great expense. They realize that I am totally vested on the company's success, so my comments/suggestions are selfless, not self-promoting, but how to get things done faster and better.<p>5. Stock options -- Yes, I have a bunch of them.  But they are more of a bet. I am not planing to be rich on them (maybe the founders will), but it is nice to know that if the company will do really well, then I get a piece of the pie too.",1233179578

You would think, being hackers, we would focus on the most efficient ways to become financially free.  But, we do not.  Instead we focus on one, very difficult, exhausting, and undependable method - selling an online startup.  Why is this?<p>Some might say it is because you want to be your own boss.  Fine, but don't you want to be your own boss because then you are free?  Isn't the original problem, then, that you are enslaved by the pursuit of money?<p>Others might say they like the glamor.  For that it seems obvious that you need large amounts of publicity and money.  But why make this assumption?  What is more glamorous, someone who is dependent on a massive infrastructure, or someone who struck out and made their own destiny?  Plus, the new, social media is much better publicity than that of the old, institutional media.  With all the time on your hands when you are financially free, you have plenty of time to make a name for yourself.<p>Finally, some may just want loads of money to spend on whatever cool gadgets and experiences they may want.  This is more difficult to achieve with financial freedom alone.  But, it is not impossible.  Again, financial freedom gives you all the time you could need, plenty of time to figure out clever ways to get what you want.<p>As capitalism proves, human ingenuity is the real wealth, and that is only limited by time.",1233179295

Are people not clever enough to come up with unique marketing plans? Or do most of them fail?<p>Coming from someone who hasn't been involved in a startup (yet!), I've never really understood this inability among founders to develop clever marketing campaigns. Everyone seems to think they need to score a blog post. And even if that's what it takes, there's huge frustration and difficulty with doing so.<p>During Startup School '08, Arrington said the best way to get on TC was to create a story. That seems pretty straightforward to me. So create one. That doesn't mean email him asking him to demo your product. It means to stir up some drama. Leak a screenshot, 'accidentally' post something on twitter, etc. I'm pretty sure that's the type of story he's talking about. In being creative with creating features, you also need to be master storytellers.<p>Instead of blog posts, there are myriad of things you could do for promotion and eyeballs. Make a bogus/cute little app that might not relate to your site like that 'Is Hillary Swank Hot?' app that was here a week ago. Make it a gag site and promote there. Here's an idea: Make weekly videos of a puppet version of your logo gruesomely killing the logos of your competitors or just popular sites in general. Be a sensationalist.<p>It really shouldn't be all that hard, guys, honestly. People these days will watch anything, and there are celebrities and fads in every corner of the internet waiting to find an audience.

455008,comment,454146,454146,0,0,coffeemug,,,"Be careful. Meditation is a buzz word and has a big industry built around it. Most of it is junk. The best meditation advice is offered by people that have taken a vow not to accept money (other than donations), so if you're being charged something other than a nominal fee, it's likely a scam.<p>Meditation is <i>not</i> about relaxation, stress relief, and being in peace with yourself and the world. These things only come as a byproduct.<p>Meditation is <i>not</i> a band aid you can apply to your life to make it better. You cannot continue living your life exactly the way it is now, medidate for half an hour a day and expect improvement. It is psychological self exploration. If you maintain your life the way it is now, you will very quickly hit a boundary and will make no further progress in meditation until your life is changed.<p>Meditation is about observing the way your mind works. The only way to do that is to anchor it by sustaining an incredibly focused attention on a single object for prolonged periods of time. It doesn't matter what the object is (although it's normally breath) - your mind responds to any object and by learning to sustain uninterrupted attention you will observe how your mind works.<p>I would suggest you to seek instruction in Anapanasati from a competent teacher. Ignore new age stuff, buddhist cosmology, relaxation and stress relief business, or any related stuff. None of it will make any lasting difference.<p>In a nutshell just follow your breathing, one breath at a time. When you discover you've lost attention, relax, smile, accept whatever emotions you're feeling, and go back to the breath. Seek a teacher once you discover how incredibly deep and subtle this process can be.<p>Good luck!<p>EDIT: I suppose I should add a disclaimer. I am far, far from an expert. If someone (including me) claims they completely understand meditation, they probably do not.",1233177801

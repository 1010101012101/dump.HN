Put the elliptical in front of TV if you like and do 30-45mins every other day. I was 193lbs in August. I'm 174lbs now. Though I'd say I'm more of an exception because I gain/lose weight really fast.

I'm not sure these roads have much to do with deciding to drive to work or take the train.<p>Yes, its true that most interstates are rural.  Of course that is true.  I'm sure that  its 95% rural.  That's the nature of a network that connects all of the major cities in the country.  And this 95% is probably a lot less relevant to whether you decide to live in the suburbs than the much more expensive part.  Of course, your edit about the cost of the SF road acknowledges this very fact.<p>Its also true that in dense urban areas, interstate highways make up a fraction of the roads used for commuting.<p>Highways that must be put through existing neighborhoods are very expensive.  And that's where highways to the suburbs had to be built.  Usually by forcing other people from their homes.  A lot of the true costs of building roads is hidden in pollution too.<p>The cost to build something is not the only cost.

Planning is hard, real estate is so expensive that people fight anything which might obstruct their view or lower their hard-bought property values (understandably), rental laws are skewed heavily in favor of tenants, and the whole process is hyper-politicized at the neighborhood level. I'm surprised the planning commissioners get anything done sometimes. Public hearings sometimes go on until 2 or 3 in the morning if it's something contentious.<p>Any large building requires several million and several years before it can even break ground; last year a developer who had already dug a foundation ended up filling it in again and selling the land after a 3-year delay. Also environmental law is used obstructively in a great many cases. I'm generally in favor of public consultation, regulations etc., but sometimes the big projects suck up all the political oxygen and that makes it harder for smaller developers to move forward. The recession hasn't helped either of course.<p>I'm not in real estate or anything, just a bit bummed that our city government hasn't been running well in recent years.",1292487386

He capitalized ""PER CAPITA"".<p>In cities, a piece of land the size of 6 suburban homes (counting backyard) can be home to several thousand people, that's why land is expensive.<p>Go to Hong Kong, you'll see apartment buildings with 40 floors. On each floor there are 20 units. In each unit there are 2 rooms, a living room, a kitchen and a toilet. Each room is 2.5 metres by 2.5 metres, the living room 3 times that. Anywhere from 2 to 6 people can live in a single unit, but usually 4; The government doesn't hand out public housing with 2 rooms to only 2 people. 4 * 20 * 40 is over 3200 residents.<p>In the suburbs the same land is home to only around two dozen people. Thus it would make sense that in Hong Kong land could be a hundred times more expensive than in a suburb anywhere else.",1292486765

My point was that becoming the President is an exceptionally difficult and highly recognized achievement and yet many Presidents are forgotten.<p>I certainly don't think it's hopeless to become 100 year memory - it'd be awesome if that happens and I think I have a higher than average chance at doing so. But I will deem my life successful (and consider myself a winner) if I achieve much more moderate goals. That's a personal choice that we all have to make about how we approach living.",1292486760

In CS I've found there are effectively unlimited opportunities for learning and exploration (if you have the basic knowledge needed to navigate the system, which while unfortunate, is the reality).

It needs to be done, but there are steps that should be taken in the mean time in order to a more fair (but admittedly suboptimal) environment for students.<p>A couple of things unacknowledged in your argument. First, there's the practical implications of cheaters on GPA. Cheaters get higher grades than what is possible without cheating, making the curve in a class lower than what it would be in a completely honest classroom. I'll be the first to champion someone who doesn't care about GPA, but there are concrete affects that a lower GPA has on students.  Even though you got a good education, it's still something to think about.  Second, there's the fact that the solution you propose is not possible in the current system. The incentive structure is all wrong (read: nonexistent) for undergraduate teaching in universities.  Further, the majority of professors don't even have the requisite skills to be good teachers.  Even if we did get the incentives right, the talent simply isn't there.  To be honest I doubt there are enough people on board with improving undergraduate education to get it done.",1292486629

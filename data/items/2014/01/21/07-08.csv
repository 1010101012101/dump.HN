They&#x27;re supposed to.<p>It is completely accurate for a lawyer to say it cannot help you _in court_ to talk to police. It cannot as a matter of law. The Miranda warning makes this pretty plain in that: &quot;Anything you say or do may be used against you in a court of law.&quot; and many now read &quot;may&quot; as &quot;can and will&quot;.<p>The police officer does not make the decision to charge you; that is done by a district attorney. The district attorney&#x27;s job is to decide if they can get a conviction. It&#x27;s also their job to get as many convictions as possible.<p>You may have read recently that 97% of federal drug convictions are plea bargains; the tl;dr being that people are forced to weigh a short sentence vs a brutally long one with a costly defense.<p>So a district attorney isn&#x27;t making the decision solely on whether they can convict you in court but on if they can get you to plea as well. When the severity of the charge is high, say for example a mandatory minimum 15 year prison sentence (even for first offenders or even if you&#x27;re only tangentially responsible for the crime (not exactly the same but Ryan Holle&#x27;s story is a good read here)) if you&#x27;re convicted, it is a lot easier for them to get you people to plea and they are more likely to proceed with charges.<p>When you interview with police, you have absolutely no idea what they plan to charge you with. They could charge you with things after speaking to you that have absolutely no relation to what they initially intend to question you about.<p>This is why you should never, ever, ever, ever take an interview with an investigating officer without a lawyer present. The safest and most paranoid extension of that is not to talk to police at all (like for reporting crimes, etc) and honestly I cannot fault anyone for that logic.",1390290377

Quite frankly I think a lot of these laws are overstepping their bounds and encroaching on personal freedom. BUT I think there&#x27;s a perfectly legitimate line to draw when it comes to using your property to provide housing for other people.<p>When you decide to use your property to make money by renting it out to other people, you are essentially taking on a huge amount of power over their livelihood, and this cannot be stated lightly. So to me this is where we as individuals and as a society need to decide how to govern this territory in a way that&#x27;s fair for both parties involved, as it is certainly not fair to widely restrict the amount of money someone can make from their property, and it is certainly detrimental to people and communities to upheave members from their homes and established roots. This is where striking a balance makes the most sense for the strength of the community, and the individual stakeholders, and will produce a strong society as a whole.<p>To me, making the claim of absolute property rights is simply weak. I don&#x27;t want to deride the most important point, as stated above, but absolute property rights don&#x27;t really make logical sense to me either, as property is often a hugely restricting resource, and one completely established by precedence rather than contribution per se.",1390290161

C and C++ are meant to run on systems which do not even have a monitor, much less a GPU (think embedded). The logic was that standard library functions should work on all systems. That is also the reason why the &quot;file system&quot; API of ISO C/C++ is so severely limited. It is designed for the lowest common denominator. There are no functions for handling directories because of the assumption that some platforms do not even have directories. In fact the file system API does not even assume a hard disk but can be implemented by returning handles to RAM.<p>Now that this principle seems to be abandoned why not go all the way and give us a full GUI toolkit? That would be so much more versatile than just a 2D drawing API.<p>I do not see much use for this except maybe making ISO C++ tutorials more exciting because your programs can show something else than console output.<p>And I mean Cairo is not a simple framebuffer, it is quite complex so why not make another step and give us a full GUI?<p>I read that the C++ guys want a standard library comparable to those of modern languages like Java, C#, Python etc. and they all come with GUI support.<p>Oh, and before they even think about adding graphics they should beef up the file system API.

Sure, I&#x27;m living a few years ahead of most people, but it is a lot easier to roll out LTE than other forms of Internet. I just wish that, like Wi-fi, your service didn&#x27;t degrade as quickly the more people connected to it. I remember back in the day, when no one had LTE up here in Canada, it was routine to see speeds of 60-150mbps. Now, less so. Depends on where you are, what device you have, a whole host of factors. Of course, more spectrum is always nicer, not so much for marketing purposes as here but to ensure there&#x27;s enough space for everyone to get more of the shared pool of bandwidth available. I&#x27;m sure if I ran LTE speed tests under a tower at 2 AM I&#x27;d get some amazing results too. :)",1390288428

People do read code all the time, they just hesitate to respond to a question like &quot;what code have you read recently&quot;. It&#x27;s hard to answer that question in english without implying that you have completely read a program (rare) that was completely written (in other words, &quot;finished&quot;, which is even more rare).<p>If you asked a different question, like &quot;explain how you read code in the course of a typical project or experiment&quot; you will get a ton of examples. They might describe how they look to understand the basic data structures, and then imagine some sample data flowing through the algorithm to understand the purpose, and then examine the details, edge cases, and interactions to see why some non-obvious choices were made. Then they might describe how they use this to find what parts of the code should be generalized, specialized, or extended to fit new functionality.<p>It might be interesting to incorporate code reading into an interview to see the strategies that people use.

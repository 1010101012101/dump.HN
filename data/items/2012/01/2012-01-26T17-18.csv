3515145,comment,3514668,3514668,8,0,aGHz,,,"Aside from my HTTP/REST rant, I think there's a much better discerning factor between POST and PUT. From the HTTP spec:<p>""The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity. [...] In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource. If the server desires that the request be applied to a different URI, it MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response; the user agent MAY then make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the request.""<p>So if you want to create the user Foo and you somehow know about the URI example.com/users/Foo, then you can directly PUT your information to that URI. This URI points directly to the enclosed entity, the user. If you only know the URI of the enclosing resource (aka collection), then you MUST do a POST to example.com/users/.<p>So that's the semantics of it, PUT deals directly with the resource that the URI points to, while POST deals with a collection of subordinate resources.<p>However, the REST catch is that if you follow the HATEOAS principle, there's (almost+) no way you would know about example.com/users/Foo. In the REST world, you would (almost) never use PUT for creating, because if that resource doesn't already exist, you would (almost) never get a URI to it by traversing the hypertext representation of the application state.<p>+ I say almost because you could have something like a GET example.com/users?name=Foo that would return 404 with the URL where to PUT to create this user. Not sure how HATEOAS proposes you get to a URL like example.com/users?name=Foo though, perhaps someone more knowledgeable can pitch in.",1327600794

I also took a one day seminar a couple of months ago from Mindbridge at a cost of about $200. This was useful for networking with others who were interested in the technique, and practicing with a partner, but I think that most of the value from the process comes from learning by doing. I recommend creating a study group or finding a partner and just charging forward if you're interested in learning more.<p>The fundamental action of the CT technique involves drilling deeper into things that you think that you want (or don't want), that are actually placeholders for something more important and more fundamental.<p>Since this is HN, I can explain this process in terms of recursion and/or iteration - basically, you apply a function multiple times until you reach a stable limit cycle or fixed point. :) (The function is applied via asking and answering certain structured questions.) For example, you may inquire into your desire for financial success, detour through a need for acceptance by your family and peers, and end up realizing this is actually a superficial symptom of a deep desire for ""inner peace"".<p>Through the process, people often experience themselves getting closer to that state that is more fundamental (""Core State"").

Perhaps this is not ideal, but it's a fact.<p>Amarok can do whatever you want it to, because plugins install in your home directory.  Never in the course of using Amarok do you affect the system's view of what Amarok is.  This is now how people treat the system Perl install; they ""sudo cpan -i ..."" and end up upgrading modules that the rest of the system depends on.  Most of the time, this works fine, because most authors are very careful to maintain backcompat.

(your host may be compromised, and could show arbitrary data, proxy connections, etc.)  Protecting the key does go a long way, but even with a secure passphrase input and smartcard key operations, there is risk.<p>The ideal, IMO, would be some secondary hardware with a limited, secure OS which lets you put specific limits on how the key is used, showing a hash or identifying details of each transaction on the secure display, prompting you to verify each.  E.g. to send a payment, the amount and payee (and date/sequence number) are shown on the secure display to verify before authorizing.",1327599976

I was under the impression that on a write you were: updating the in memory dataset so that the user could immediately read their data after the write, queuing a write to MySQL, and then responding to the user (200 OK) even though the data had not been committed.<p>So my concern regarding consistency was that during this period after responding to the user but before your queue committed data that a bug or hardware failure would result in some users thinking that there requests were successful but none of their work would be saved.<p>As long as the user doesn't receive a response until data has been committed to your DB this makes sense.<p>Now that I understand the flow a bit better I agree that it makes sense.  This is similar to what folks were trying to do with MySQL-Proxy.  I still think that you're asking for trouble by coupling your components together in the same process and would really encourage you to take it to the next level by factoring out caching and proxying/batching of db access into their own services.<p>The more I think about this the more it seems like it would be reasonable to build as a separate twisted process and exposed through a api compatible with twisted.enterprise.adbapi...

Of course in innodb the buffer pool / insert buffers can be thought of the same way.

Then nest is the IO to the db fs, so you can sustain the rate of the flushes. You can tune some of this much better with some percona mysql patches.

Moses was in love with cars, but never experienced traffic as his limo was chauffered with a police escort. He built highways and made them inaccessible to public transportation (see the West Side Highway) so that poor people could not use them. He had no real understanding of capacity utilization/maximization for transport and stopped learning long before he stopped designing. He never updated his understanding of the damages caused by simply adding more highways, but retained the power to keep building them.<p>The most pernicious impact of Moses's style of urban planning is not, however, gridlock or a lack of walkability. Moses decided that he could put roads wherever he wanted, and used eminent domain to put them right through vibrant communities - which he destroyed. He killed the bronx, parts of Queens, Brooklyn, and almost ran a huge raised highway across 34th street.<p>In any case, The Power Broker is an amazing book to read if you're curious about these issues and why cities are designed the way they are now.",1327599006

Suppose you want a unit fraction 1/n with decimals that cycle through the 4-digit sequence abcd. Multiply by 10^4 to shift abcd into integer position, leaving repeating copies after the decimal point:<p><pre><code>    10^4/n = abcd + 1/n

Solving for n gives n = (10^4 - 1) / abcd.<p>More generally, if you want to get a cycle equal to the d digits of an integer k, you want n = (10^d - 1) / k.<p>However, this only gives a true unit fraction when k divides 10^d - 1, so that n is an integer. Otherwise you are forced to truncate n and getting an approximate version of the cycle.<p>That's exactly what happened here: 10^d - 1 is not divisible by the integer 001002...998999.<p>Here's a small Python program that will generate the unit fraction given the number of digits to cycle through:<p><pre><code>    import sys

    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    s = ''.join((""%0"" + str(n) + ""d"") % (i,) for i in range(10**n))

They then tested a large amount of devices to find ones where a nanotube of the right kind (semiconducting) had placed itself in a correct alignment with the gate and metalized contacts (source and drain). Once they knew what devices were working they imaged some of the working devices with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and did a bunch of standard transistor measurements.<p>As was commented earlier, the specific growth of nanotubes in a well defined position is not easily achieved. There is IMO a long time until anyone can do a full chip where nanotubes grow exactly where one wants the transistors. It might even be that graphene is a more convenient technology for just this reason (since graphene can be grown somewhat more conveniently by annealing SiC wafers). A side note I guess is that growing nanotubes and pillars vertically can be done in specific spots on a wafer, but that makes manufacturing of the gate a bit problematic.

However, it's much, much harder than it sounds. You do an excellent job of addressing the programming concepts themselves in the text, but there's a lot more to it than that.<p>First, and foremost, I'm not sure who your target reader is. Judging by the jargon you use, I'm not sure he exists. Someone who has never programmed before is almost definitely not going to know how to ""go back to [his] terminal [and] run the program with the command ruby closet.rb,"" or even how to ""open up a new file called closet.rb in [his] text editor."" If he's a Windows user, he probably don't even have Ruby installed. Further, a beginning programer probably does not understand why he cannot easily/should not use  Microsoft Word as his text editor.<p>On the other hand, someone who knows how to do all of this probably understands the basics of programming. I'm not sure they'd want to read this chapter and wade through a few dozen paragraphs of prose to learn how to use the standard input, output, and string concatenation in Ruby. I doubt this is your target reader.<p>If you're aiming for the first programmer, you probably want a dedicated programming environment to start them off. It could be as simple as a ""djinn package"" that installs a basic text editor with Ruby syntactical highlights and the command line tools, but a big red ""run this program"" button on the editor is always nice. You can wean them off of the custom editor later.<p>Also, you'll almost definitely want to include the most basic an intro to debugging code. A book is non-interactive, and you have to prepare for the event that nobody can say, ""Oh, 'Unterminated string meets end of file' means you forgot a double quote here on line 3,"" to the user. Perhaps have the narrator make a mistake, the genie correct him, and talk about why the computer wants strings to have double quotes. Or something.<p>It's a great start, but you just need to get past a few more pitfalls.<p>edit: Fixed a few grammar issues. Also, I'm Math/CS teacher and currently teach 8th through 12th graders.",1327597931

If you create something offline, it will never sync it back to the remote host when the connectivity is restored. It will stay local and might lead to problems down the road (when updating a locally created record, the remote host will not know about it)",1327597612

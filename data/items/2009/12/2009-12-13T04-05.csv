I'd almost like to write in Scheme, if Python didn't (a) come more naturally, having written much more code in it (b) seem to have more libraries etc... (c) I have formal education in Python, and I still don't have a solid grasp on where call/cc would be used in a program, which signals to me that I'm not ready to use Scheme.<p>I'm also decent with sysadmin tools, by no means an expert, but I can use bash and I can script a bit.<p>So yes and no?<p>I'm all for the agile approach. I'd like to open with a bang, though. I'm thinking a designer?<p>2. I suppose I do just need to step into the game. Now.

We've been using Exchange 14 as our one and only email server solution for quite a while, and yes it has gone down a fair amount and cost a ton of productivity, but it also gave the Exchange team invaluable feedback. I've also got some very painful personal experiences of dogfooding Team Foundation Server in its early days. It's not like we can say ""eh this early build sucks, let's go back to X for now"", because there is no X, it's been completely removed. The dogfooding is hardcore on purpose.<p>But the ""MS employee using non-MS tech"" myth is really a myth. At least nowadays it is. MS employees will and do use anything and everything. As a simple example, I personally know at least 20 MS employees with iPhones (including myself).

Here are the two most interesting statements from the piece to me:<p>> Foul play is assumed and the hunt is on for a culprit; a natural suspect is man made CO2, which has increased coincidental with temperatures. It's a small part of overall global greenhouse gases (5.5% if you don't include water vapor, 0.3% if you do), but maybe -- just maybe -- the atmosphere is in a delicate, wobbly, equilibrium balance.<p>It never occurred to me that human-produced carbon-dioxide was such a small percent of the greenhouse gases.<p>Then there was this:<p>> But a funny thing happened on the way to Copenhagen: a couple of Canadian researchers, McIntyre and McKitrick, found that when they ran simulations of ""red noise"" random principle components data into Mann's reconstruction model, 99% of the time it produced the same hockey stick pattern. They attributed this to Mann's method / time frame for selecting of principle components.<p>That's just a wow.

Maybe some sort of simple declarative system to check that the code obeys certain constraints. Ideally, you could make your auto-test system clever enough to actually deduce a lot of the constraints itself, based on the structure of the code--you'd really save time that way!

I finally got around to reading it the other day, and my verdict is simple: it was terrible.  Taibbi wrote a terrific article about AIG a couple of months ago, but the Goldman piece was just phoned in, a long series of blustery assertions with essentially nothing to back up any of them.  If he wants to claim that Goldman was the wizard behind the curtain of everything from the dotcom boom to last year's oil spike, he really needs to produce some evidence for it instead of just saying so.</i>  (<a href=""http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/07/furloughs-and-perks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/07/furloughs-and-perk...</a>)<p>And libertarian Megan McArdle of the Atlantic:<p><i>I think, sadly, [that] Matt Taibbi is becoming the Sarah Palin of journalism.  He seems to deliberately eschew understanding his subjects, because only corrupt, pointy-headed financial journalists who have been co-opted by the system do that.  And Matt Taibbi is here to save you from those pointy headed elites.<p>Taibbi is a gifted narrative journalist, whose verbal talents I greatly admire.  But financial meltdowns don't offer villains, for the simple reason that no one person or even one group is powerful enough to take down a whole system.  Confronted with this, Taibbi doesn't back away from the narrative form, or apply it to smaller questions where it is more appropriate, as William Cohan did in House of Cards.  Instead, he grabs whoever's nearest to hand and builds them up into a gigantic straw villian, which he proceeds to bash with a handful of recently acquired technical terms that he clearly doesn't quite understand.  It's not that everything he says is wrong, but the bits that are true aren't interesting, and the bits that are interesting aren't true.</i>  (<a href=""http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/07/matt_taibbi_gets_his_sarah_pal.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/07/matt_ta...</a>)",1260678823

Taibbi is not interested in an writing an even-handed examination of Obama’s economic policies: he’s interested in writing an enjoyable screed which jumps off the page and which describes Alan Greenspan as “a staggeringly incompetent economic forecaster who was worshipped by four decades of politicians because he once dated Barbara Walters”.

Hell, you don't even need multithreading to do a webserver, just use Unix processes. My issue with Lisp is that there is no standard for multi-threaded Lisp; the ANSI spec doesn't consider threading at all.

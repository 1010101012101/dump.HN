But when a country that used to take care about its own, all of a sudden points the middle finger to those who is in need I feel angry and disappointed and somewhat alienated from my own country. I was brought up being told that tax money was going to hospitals, schools, Unemployment benefits etc etc. because everyone has the right to these things, and everyone has the duty to finance it. Now what is happening is that we have the same tax rate as before, except if you are wealthy, then the taxes have dropped or even disappeared, and more and more of the things that where a right in Sweden is becoming a privilege for the people who don´t need it and financed by the lower portion in the social ladder.<p>Oh, and now we have something called RUT-Avdrag. Its basically a thing where the state pays 50% if you employ a maid or call in someone to clean your house. It was to ""create more work"" and ""to help ordinary stressed career people"". As it turned out it haven't created so many new jobs. And the average middle class stressed career person would save more money by taking 4 hours of work to clean by him/her-self than to rent a cleaning person for 4 hours. This was one of the first things Alliansen did for Sweden after they took over the parliament. Oh yeah, and wealth tax was quickly gone too.<p>Sure, there are some things that should be privatizationed, the railroad to name one(it doesn't work, at all) but you don´t fuck with the health care and the school system and the unemployment benefits to name a few(That made Sweden the awesome country it was) to finance stuff such as RUT-Avdrag and getting rid of wealth tax, and then tell the world ""Hey!

They send you a box of clothes to try on and review with your expert over Skype video. Any items you don't like or don't fit you put back in the box and send back. They include the return shipping label in the box so you just have to put the label on tape up the box and have FedEx pick it up. You only pay for the items you keep (no shipping charges or extra fees). They try to make the process as painless as possible.<p>Over time as you meet with your style expert, it's always the same person, and get to know each other they get a better sense for what you like and don't like as well as keeping track of things such as sizes and fits. They also recommend what things work well together so you know what things to wear together, etc. They have definitely pushed me out of my t-shirt and jeans comfort zone, without going to fashionista or anything.<p>The primary drawback is my clothes budget is definitely higher than it use to be, as most of the clothes are significantly more expensive (no $20 dollar jeans) as they tend to come from more boutique and small manufacturers.<p>While that probably sounds an awful lot like an advertisement I have no connection with Hendricks Park other than as a happy customer.",1300730010

At least there seems to be plenty of monitoring going on in Japan, and wide access to frequently updated data.
NHK today was reporting the government website now has hour by hour values tabulated.  I think that's to help people understand that the daily averages are mostly well below the peak values that get attention.  Using a peak hourly rate value for a daily or longer calculation may cause people to over react.  (Of course people may have other exposure through food, water etc.)<p>Studying two other incidents, one at a Japanese fuel facility in 1999 (closed in 2003) and the other with a U.S. army Idaho Falls (Dugway testing grounds) reactor that went critical in an accident in 1961 provides insight into the neutron-moderating behavior of water, and interesting case studies of exposure to people after the initial events.

Honestly, it sounds like he wrote off virtualenv without trying it, because he'd have far less complaints about porting and dependencies if he had.<p>As for the GIL, the author didn't even consider multiple processes -- he explained them away as a solution for some workloads. A Web app is one giant workload where this model makes sense: multiprocessing is the approach you should be taking with a Web application. Tie a request to one core, and spawn enough WSGI applications for the number of cores you have (and then some). That's an elegant solution to this problem, since a request doesn't need to fart around with other requests in most cases. If your app can't handle multiple copies of itself running, how do you expect it to scale?<p>This reads a little bit like a waffling, like a person who considers a completely different environment and rewrite of the entire stack a solution to some thorns in Python.

Believing I'm wrong for not having the same religious believes is their prerogative (an there is absolutely nothing wrong with that), but being offensive is not telling me they think I'm wrong, it's telling me that it doesn't matter what I think because there is only one correct religion to follow without letting express my point of view.<p>Freedom of speech comes with dangers and responsibilities that lean on your shoulders. If you're gay, it's your choice to come out or not. When you do so you automagically earn the right to defend your position when being confronted with an opposing point, and you also get the danger of being ostracized from a specific social group. That's not the opposing party's fault, nor is it yours, it's just the way the world works wether we like it or not. I might get kicked out of the basketball court cause I'm white, or banned from a church because I'm an atheist, which is for all purposes not fair (in the grand scheme of things), but the same way I'm being given the choice to choose who I am and who I socialize with, a social group has the right to exclude people that don't match their qualifications.<p>Don't get me wrong, I agree that it sucks and it's definitely not fair for certain parties, but look at it this way: If you're a popular kid in high school and you want to hang out with the cool people, it's your right to exclude the people that are not cool as long as you don't violate their rights. If you're playing tennis at a private club at which you're not actually a member and the authorities that manage said place want you to leave, it's their prerogative to kick you out.<p>If you're gay and you come by an application to 'cure you with prayer' you have the right to NOT download it, as well as you have to right to express your disapproval as long as you're not violating anyone's rights. The same way that people that agree with the applications use have the right to download, use, and incite the use of said app - once again, without stepping over other peoples rights.<p>At the end of the day we all have the human right to make our own choices and live with the consequences of out actions. If an action is going to alienate me from a social group I have a choice. I have a choice to go ahead with whatever belief I might have, or I might value more the social interaction I might get excluded from. Gay people have two choices in this matter, if you agree with their point of view, you can download the app (a high schooler might need to get laid and drink booze to get into the crowd, illegal notwithstanding, he's free to make his own choice to either fit in or not). If you don't you can ignore it and then make a blog post about how you're unhappy with the apps existence. Every person has a right to dislike me and my beliefs, and that's fine. They, however, have no right to violate my rights while disliking me and my beliefs... and this app is not violating anyone's rights while preaching their beliefs through it.",1300727738

Though I have no idea what percentage of the total expenditure that is, judging by the effect it has on the major driving forces of fashion (namely, none), it must be pretty small. About 4-5 years ago, a company in California did conduct some research into the sizing of women's clothing, and some of that has led to changes trickling into what's being offered on the shelf. But the research was conducted only on women, and the company doing the research even admitted that their population sample was insufficient. From what I can tell, all of the basic sloper patterns that ready to wear garments are built from get their standard sizing from... nowhere. Or a mysterious table of measurements dating back to the 1940s. Take your pick.<p>Compound this with the total lack of quality control in garment manufacture and you begin to see why shopping is such an ordeal. The same brand and fit (model?) of pants from Dockers, Levis or the Gap will fit you differently, depending on the color of the fabric. Typically, the darker the color of the garment, the more snug the fit. Sounds ridiculous, right? Lighter fabrics tend to relax out more. It's all about the fabric content. Raise your hand if you've ever washed something and had it either get smaller or bigger, or become completely misshapen. Quality control is done on the first hundred or so garments that come out of the factory. After that, it's a free-for-all.<p>People don't know what suits them because there is a very real learning curve to the whole process of getting yourself dressed. This is why most women shop and dress in groups. Institutional knowledge is hugely valuable. So is a cloth tape measure.<p>I watch What Not To Wear. They make it look easy. Then they make it look hard (the ""victim"" almost always cries). Because drama sells. But behind the scenes is an entire staff of people who follow fashion trends, understand a great deal about ready to wear garments and know where to go and what it costs. That's a full time job. Nobody has that kind of time, and it's a barrier to entry.<p>Not caring about what kind of statement our clothes make is a learned behavior. The fashion industry does not care about the happiness of the customer. If you don't believe me, find a girl who won't slap you for it and ask her about her bra. So if they don't care, why should we?",1300727370

That suggests to me that the number of active users is 10 or 20 times lower (100000 to 200000 users). Even if only 20% of those are paying, that's enough to be very profitable.<p>Given these numbers, I'd estimate that they'd serve 3-15 billion pages per year. With 100 CPUs, that's 1-5 requests per second per CPU. Of course, what matters is peak usage, not average.",1198326299

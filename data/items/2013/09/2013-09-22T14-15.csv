On the side I wrote a checkbook program, calendaring app, and RPG character generator.<p>I have fond memories of DBase, especially DBase III+. I remember when computers had &quot;turbo&quot; buttons and you could make a dog program run like lightning by simply hitting the button. I also remember compiling DBase programs in Clipper, and all sorts of other fun stuff. I worked for one guy that bought faster crystals to make his CPUs run better -- the very first PC overclocking that I ever saw.<p>Eventually, the home/small business database market went to Microsoft, who released MS Access. All of the &quot;real&quot; programmers said it was a toy and wouldn&#x27;t deign to use it, but consumers bought it up and started creating their own apps. This was great news for me, because most of the time they created a mess and somebody had to come in and clean it all up.

It&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous that CDs, which have existed for over 30 years already, still offer higher quality audio than you can generally buy digitally. It&#x27;s a sad truth in general that if you want high quality digital media, you&#x27;ll either have to buy and rip physical products yourself or resort to piracy - this is true for both audio and video, especially the latter - hell, with video you can barely even BUY anything digitally since it&#x27;s all either streaming or files DRM up the bum (both of which are ultimately just renting).<p>In case of music, the Bandcamp model should really be the default - one price allows you to get the product in whatever common format you want, be that lossless FLAC or just bog-standard MP3. It would definitely make me buy a helluva lot more music than I currently do.

6426785,comment,6423590,6424126,1,0,pkj,,,"I had taken a course designed by him at stanford: object oriented programming from a modeling and simulation perspective. I also have the lecture notes for the follow-up course. It was mentioned that the course was based on his real world experience doing c++ programming in academia and startup that he sold to Cisco. It was very clear from the beginning that the course was radically different from any programming course I had seen. Highly opinionated in almost every page. There was rarely anything that he repeated from any standard c++ books. I enjoyed the course, though only about 5% still remains with me. I have worked in teams using c++ extensively to manage $Billion+ products, and can attest that the course definitely had some value. Also, I had interviewed with a C++ team in Cisco 4K catalyst group and they mentioned they were still building on the c++ platform laid by Cheriton&#x27;s group ( a decade later).<p>Talking about any disadvantages, I can say that you need someone of Cheriton&#x27;s ability to really guide you during the initial build-up of the project. His ideas of having the compiler do a lot of checking to avoid bugs in the code later are really cool. But the learning curve is pretty steep. Newer paradigms (since the course was originally designed) like STL, BOOST, and tips in Effective C++/STL etc can replace some of the concepts he espouses. But he is pretty clear that some of them are really inferior. It might be true for some cases, but I have usually used them in production just fine..",1379861439

The best ways to increase supply of labor is increase wages and on the job training.  This will send a signal to potential workers to seek work in the field.  The government does not need increase subsides to  wealthy industries with special access to non-immigrant guest workers and free training programs.  Business can solve this &quot;problem&quot; with good wages.  Every business complains about paying for talent, and workers always want a little more.  They can both set the market rate for wages which will determine supply of labor.",1379860099

6426727,comment,6426630,6426630,2,0,TheSwordsman,,,"I think I agree with the blog post in its entirety, as a fellow Pythonista / Debianite. The Debian packages that are released always seem to be top-notch, stable, and fit for production. (Let&#x27;s forget the OpenSSL incident, shall we?) I don&#x27;t fear that the new version is going to break my currently installed software, and I&#x27;m not worried about dependencies somehow having been missed causing havoc. It just works.<p>(And when it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s because I did something deep within dpkg/apt I should not have.)<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve always had the same experience with other distributions which is the reason why I moved to Debian in the first place. Truthfully, I can&#x27;t ramble any specific scenarios off from the top of my head.<p>Any time I&#x27;ve had an issue with a Debian software package, the bug threads have always been constructive with proponents for both sides explaining why it should be one way over the other. Eventually, the best decision is made (even if I personally disagree).<p>However, the sacrifice for this stability is the fact packages can become a bit &#x27;stale&#x27; when it comes to new versions. I don&#x27;t mind sacrifices like this. And if you need newer stuff, that&#x27;s why backports exist.<p>If you want the latest and the greatest use pip. But for the love of all things, couple your pip usage with a virtual environment. Hell, even if you aren&#x27;t using pip get in the habit of using a venv.<p>My only bad experience with virtualenvs was a recent Python security update (related to /dev/random). The system libraries changed, the Python executable in the venv did not, sadness ensued. Even then, once I figured out the issue, it was a quick fix. Just re-init the virtualenv, and it fixed it for me. No need to move code around.<p>In short, if I want a stable system I don&#x27;t need to babysit, I go with Debian. I trust the people maintaining the packages. I use virtualenvs for 90% of my Python development, and use pip inside of those venvs.<p>Hasn&#x27;t failed me, yet.

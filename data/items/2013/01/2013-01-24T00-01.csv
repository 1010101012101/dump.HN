Especially in high-growth companies, where many of the bettors appear to believe that trees grow to heaven, and the company's yearly profits will soon exceed the world GDP.<p>So the stock of high-growth companies sell at an enormous markup compared to current profits.
By the same token, that markup can evaporate very quickly if a formerly-high-growth company shows any sign of slowdown.<p>In terms of the simple model above: If traders used to think that the $1m-profit company would grow 60% annually for the next decade, and something happens that makes them believe that it won't be more than 40%, the value of the company would immediately drop by more than 60%.",1358989041

Get VERY good at fuzzy matching algorithms, they can't possibly be too hard.  I have an iPhone that for no obvious reason to me, has 8 different versions of a single contact, despite having near-exact replicas of the contact's data.  I want a 1:1 match of people:contacts.  Even a basic flow wherein you say ""Here's all the contacts we're merging... uncheck any you think we messed up"" would be hugely useful on all devices.  But for this, you need to be able to write/delete contacts.. no idea if that's possible in an Apple world.  I'm staggered that no one is doing this today (that I know of).<p>2) Import from all normal places where people store contacts (Facebook, Google, Yahoo, ICQ, Twitter, AOL Messenger, LinkedIn, Myspace, iCloud/Apple, Exchange, Linux datastores, etc... this obviously takes time).<p>3) Once you've imported, provide re-export / de-duping for all sources (in other words, after you've gone through and classified my contacts, allow me to say ""Sync all that information back into Google contacts, Plaxo, etc."").<p>4) Really ideally, don't store the raw data on your servers, only store it encrypted so that you can't answer government requests.  This requirement conflicts with your ability to get raw data to feed those fuzzy algorithms, though, so it'd probably have to get dropped, I'm guessing.<p>5) If you want to increase your viral coefficient dramatically, start building identity profiles of people based off of publicly-available information on the Net, and offer it to people who already have that person as a contact.  Increased stalking capabilities are always popular (if evil).<p>6) Export not just to services, but to any popular data formats (Sounds like you have CardDav taken care of, but even just raw XML exports, CSV exports, tab-delimited exports, exports of just address data or phone numbers or names, etc.)<p>7) Allow an option whereby a user can have a personal profile, and when that user's contact info changes, notify anyone connected that their contact info has changed.  (Probably not that important until you get to Facebook scale)<p>8) Allow for groupings, and allow a person to be in multiple groupings (while still understanding that that person is the same person).  Start with some basics (Family, Friends, Co-workers), and import say Exchange contacts into Co-workers by default).  Also, sync groupings with external services on demand.<p>There's probably more, but even just solving #1 would be a huge deal.",1358988719

5106371,comment,5104430,5104430,1,0,csense,,,"The following is my point of view.  I understand some people have a different point of view, and I don't have a problem if they make it known, and their families and health care providers respect their wishes.<p>But from where I sit, the dying doctors' point of view, as presented in this article, struck me as irrational.<p>Axiom:  Being dead is better than being alive.  Under all circumstances.<p>I personally believe this axiom, very strongly.  I'd rather spit in the eye of death with my last breath than go quietly into the night.<p>It logically follows, then, that a treatment that has a 1% chance of working is better than doing nothing, if the latter has a 0% chance of working, no matter how extreme the treatment is.<p>Living longer, even in a state of constant extreme pain, is better than dying.  Well, maybe dying peacefully would be less painful for my relatives, but again, I personally place a much higher value on my own life than my family's feelings of sadness or whatever.<p>The only question which remains is the validity of the Axiom.  If this world is all there is, if when you die there isn't an afterlife or reincarnation or whatever...then the Axiom is clearly true.<p>If you have strong religious belief, then perhaps your afterlife is better.  But only a <i>perfect</i> belief that you <i>are</i> headed to a <i>better</i> place makes it rational to give up.  If you have a little bit of doubt -- if you're 99% sure you're going to Heaven but 1% of you whispers that maybe there's nothing and you'll turn into dust instead -- you still want to put off rolling that die as long as you can.  Ditto if you're 100% sure there's an afterlife and 99% sure you've been good enough to get into Heaven, but 1% of you says that maybe Hell is where you're headed.<p>If your religion forbids suicide, and there's a chance that the Judge who will weigh your life will interpret not opting for the best available medical treatment as equivalent to suicide, then that affects your decision too.  Although, to be fair, this cuts both ways:  The suffering you cause your family by lingering beyond your time on Earth might count against you too.  Literally ""Damned if you do, damned if you don't.""  It's unclear enough that there should really be a few more commandments or something, to address all the corner cases.",1358988309

We have a monetary system that abstracts the idea of value; ownership isn't necessary for that to exist. The question we want to answer is, if we give an individual control over some value, and through their actions they cause additional value to come into being, how much of that additional value should we, through use of violence, enable them to control? The answer may range from ""none of it"" all the way up to ""all of it"".<p>Why would it be any of it? Possible reasons are at least twofold: First, that person may have demonstrated a unique ability to multiply value, which we wish to harness. Second, it may incentivize others who desire control to be more productive.<p>But lots more questions fall out of that. How likely is this person to be unusually productive again? How much of an incentive is this control to others, and how does it affect the overall growth of value? How much of an incentive is necessary to maintain our desired rate of growth? What <i>is</i> our desired rate of growth?<p>And on to more complicated ones: Say we decide to afford some amount of control. Should that amount be the same regardless of the value created? Should the scale be linear, quadratic, what? How should we respond to actors who fail to create, or actually destroy value?<p>As if that weren't enough to think about already, we now have to consider the externalities, what you might call ""ethical"" concerns. A couple of major ones:<p>Does our system unfairly determine the course of an individual's life based on the circumstances of their birth, making a mockery of the concept of freedom?<p>Does our system perversely incentivize us to manipulate it in order to increase nominal value, without an according improvement to the human condition?<p>This isn't intended to answer your question exactly, just to point out that 1) There are a lot of problems with the way we set all this up, but 2) We did set it up this way for good reasons, and 3) Anyone who takes all of this and gives you a ""Of course they do"" or ""Of course they don't"" has been indoctrinated.",1358987037

All different doctors ran a battery of very expensive tests, none of which I was in any condition to consent to. They discovered nothing. Most of the time I spent on a bed in the hallway under piercing lights, being ignored, surrounded by such chaos that I had PTSD from it for months. Nobody was able to provide any form of tangible help. I got better on my own just resting for a few days.<p>That was only the beginning. I received dozens of singleton bills for the co-pay amounts for dozens of separate procedures and tests, which each arrived in my mailbox over a period of seven months. Seven months of surprise bills for  various different things they did in a period of a couple of hours. The charges totalled in the thousands. And of course, for each separate charge, I got mail from both the insurance company and the hospital.<p>The net effect being that I received nothing except doctors saying ""we see nothing wrong"" and being sent home. But I had to endure finding surprise bills in the mail, and doing the paperwork to pay and file them, randomly for the next seven months. Every one a reminder of how a system took advantage of me while I was down and couldn't answer for myself.<p>I felt betrayed, like could not one person have the sensitivity and take the time to let me rest somewhere and feed me food and gatorade or something? And no matter how much I wanted to move on from it and get on with my life, I still had to face the bills streaming in like randomized salt rubbed into the wound.<p>Lesson: Take outstanding care of yourself at all times without fail.

5106195,comment,5105882,5105882,1,0,jessriedel,,,"Zambuni's comment is definitely true, although I don't think it accounts for the incredible uniformity of the 40-hour work week.  (For instance, if employees properly valued healthcare as compensation, then the 20-hour employees would rationally accept less than half the pay of a 40-hour employee.)<p>There are other contributing ""signaling"" effects which are postulated, e.g. if you tell a future employer you only want to work 20 hours they take this as a sign that you are lazy or not committed.  These signaling effects result in an inefficient market (i.e. a non-optimal work schedule is negotiated) and have been used to justify government intervention.  It seems surprising that signally effects could be this large, but people also argue that most college educations are essentially zero value-added and serve only signaling functions as well.  I've been influence a lot by economist Robin Hanson in this direction, and you can find to read from him.<p>Lots of disagreement among academics, though, so take it with a grain of salt.",1358985864

Unfortunately, a huge amount of people are falling through the cracks. Sweden's system might be worse for rich/upper middle class people, but the average case is more than acceptable and the deviation is small. For instance, if you come in with a non life threatening condition, you will have to wait. That could mean waiting months for a specific surgery that you might get instantly in the US if you had good insurance. That kinda sucks when you have to wait and you're in pain, but is understandable unless you want to spend 50% of GDP on health care, or prioritize people based on how much they earn.",1358985776

97852,story,,,3,5,sonink,"Should Yahoo open up its web search index?",,"Even though initiatives like EC2, S3, wikia and nutch are lowering the barrier for the next wave of innovation on search - building and maintaining an internet wide index is still a huge engineering initiative.<p>The only player which comes close to google is yahoo. If yahoo opens up its index like wikia it could set the stage for the next wave of innovation in search. Through a use based pricing model like amazon it might also make business sense for yahoo (lets face it, yahoo search isnt really going anywhere yet) and just might also help yahoo in getting its mojo back.",1200232480

97850,comment,97829,97840,0,0,DarrenStuart,,,"totally agree, being a programmer is more than writin code. I have pulled a 90 hour week of writing code and it was very painful and I would never do it again.<p>I tend to pull an hour and then do something else unless I am in the zone and I can go up to about 3 hours and then break and come back to it.<p>8 hour days normally go like this when working with at clients place.<p>hour 1. opening up stuff, replying to email, grabbing a coffee, having a chat with co-workers(makes for a better working atosphere and you might learn something).<p>hour2. working on project, coding some, asking questions about the spec(if there is a spec, if not then asking questions that the end client or the account manager hadn't tought to ask)<p>hour3. repeat 2 but throw in a coffee and a chat and maybe a quick surf while you drink your coffee.<p>hour4. repeat 2<p>hour5. lunch time get up and move around people<p>hour6. repeat 2<p>hour7. repeat 3<p>hour8. start tying up loseends last coffee of the day etc send those emails you have been meaning to do, have a look at your bug list and fix a couple.<p>now you have done about 3 to 4 hours coding and plenty of other work.",1200231539

97847,comment,97829,97829,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"I'm part of a distributed team.  Apart from daily scrums where we all sync up, we all set our own hours.<p>I have a wife and two teenage kids so I work nights as much as I can and sleep during the day when they are at work and in school.  We see each other in the mornings and evenings.<p>When I'm in a serious mood I try and get three 4 hour shifts done with a two hour break in between each.  If I don't get sidetracked I can get ""in the groove"" for one or two of these shifts. After a few days of that or whenever I feel burnout approaching I spend one day where the work shifts are swapped out for personal/family time.<p>If I can't be in a serious mood for whatever reason, I just let my ""work brain"" idle and let my life's ""garbage collection"" take over until I get back on track.",1200230549

97844,comment,97829,97834,0,0,icky,,,"It's really the bad clients that force you to become a take-no-prisoners mercenary consultant.<p>Other fun things (none of which is legal advice!):<p>- Never, ever, ever, sign an indemnity clause.  That's basically an agreement to go bankrupt if anyone ever sues them over your work.  (If they can't budge on it, due to an evil legal dept, you should research whether indemnity clauses are enforceable against employees (not contractors) in your area.  If not, you can mention that they can always hire you as an employee for the duration of the project -- at your consulting rate!)<p>- Only fixed-bid for fixed-scope (change orders should always be hourly, and fixed bids should have at least a 100% fudge factor in your favor (same with calendar estimates).  No, you do NOT mention that part to the clients.  Some people recommend more than just doubling, but it's worked for me so far).<p>- For jobs you don't really want, try quoting a higher rate, and see if they take it!  (Eventually, you'll find out what your market rate is).  Pad your rate proportionally to how much you DON'T want the job. :)<p>- Never bid on a job from a position of weakness:  there should never be a job that you NEED to have, otherwise you will get screwed.<p>- Bill weekly.  (Never call it a bill, always an ""invoice"").<p>- Do not continue work when the client has more than a couple thousand dollars in delinquent balance due, until you're paid, or unless the client is a really good client, and you know they're good for it.<p>- Never subcontract for someone who's friends with the client.  They will be unable to maintain the naturally adversarial relationship between consultant and client, and they'll let things slide (such as late or delinquent payments) that they shouldn't.<p>- More generally, avoid situations where you can't bill the client directly.<p>- When logging your hours, always keep good notes of what you're doing.  Clients like knowing what they're paying for.<p>- If the client likes to call outside of normal working hours, institute a minimum 3-hours-billable for each off-hours call.  Now, you can sleep at night!<p>- Always be professional and courteous.  Never burn bridges, no matter how tempting.<p>- Emotion and drama are your enemies.  Both your own, and your clients'.  Especially keep emotion out of the picture when negotiating about money.<p>- Go the extra mile to keep your best clients.  Weed out the bad ones.<p>- Don't put up with abuse.<p>- Always negotiate in good faith.<p>- Always under-promise and over-deliver!  NEVER over-promise and under-deliver!",1200230290

97842,comment,97709,97810,0,0,zoltz,,,"There may be an underlying reason for the difference in tastes here: if you are generally inclined to <i>reflect</i> on the things you encounter you don't want to be presented irrelevant clutter because it wastes your reflection resources. The ""masses"" are not inclined that way, for them it's just: the more they get presented with the better.",1200230105
97841,comment,97829,97829,0,0,dhouston,,,"first, find a job you enjoy -- the tech job market is good enough now where you can afford to be selective (at least in the valley/other tech hubs) -- ideally, something that you would find exciting enough to do even if you weren't getting paid, as the cliche goes.<p>second, i think it's common for developers to get the equivalent of writers' block when the upcoming task is large and/or poorly defined. some things that have helped with this:<p>- tricking yourself to take on little pieces of the bigger project (google 'structured procrastination' and hamming's article on productivity); carving out explicit ""next steps"" (without dependencies) that you can start on now<p>- writing down a plan or specs to at least get things on paper/into your editor to bring clarity to a jumble of random thoughts<p>- reducing distractions; putting on headphones (esp. noise cancelling); stopping multitasking

97840,comment,97829,97829,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>I am a bit daunted by the prospect of working 8 hours straight, every day [...] 2-3 hours of real work per day [might be] more realistic.</i><p>I think part of the issue here is how you define ""work"".  I probably spend about 3 hours a day actively writing code, but I would still say that I'm working 12+ hours a day -- the fact is that most of my time is spent coming up with ideas for how to solve problems and convincing myself that the solutions I've found are in fact the <i>right</i> solutions.<p>Lawyers understand this -- they'll bill you for time they've spent thinking about your file while having a shower just the same as they bill you for time they spend at a computer writing up legal documents.  Unless you're purely a code monkey who writes code according to directions and never thinks about what he's doing, there's nothing wrong with counting ""think time"" as time you spend working.<p>Edit: See also my comments from November about procrastinating: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=81366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=81366</a>",1200229216

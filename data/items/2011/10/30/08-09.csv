3173937,comment,3172136,3172136,2,0,mrmasa,,,"Let me clear a couple of basic things related to this issue.<p>The origin of Zen comes from greater vehicle Buddhism. In Buddhism, we have two main derivatives: greater vehicle Buddhism and small vehicle Buddhism.<p>Small vehicle Buddhism devotedly focuses on what Buddha done to reach nilvana. So, they execute tough ascetic training in shrines.<p>But, as we know, not everyone can execute such training because of many reasons. So, greater vehicle Buddhism was born. And Zen was established in China by indian Buhddist, Daruma because it was heretical in India. After Confucianism became major religion in China, Japan was the successor of Zen. This is the history.<p>This story is pertially  closed to the origin of Christianity.<p>Zen is the practice everyone can do.\nControlling anger, relieving oneself from anxiety, and exploring answers inside, not outside. That's all.  The meditation is one of the methods. We can do it everywhere.<p>One of the key concept in Buddhism is ""changing ever"". Everything is unstable.<p>And, I realize that one of the Jobs's greatest management philosophy is to release his past. This philosophy is very closed the above concept in Buddhism.  As we get old, we easily stick to our past achievement. But, it doesn't mean anything, even will be bottleneck for us to step forward simply because everything changes, which also means everything is imperfect.<p>I think this is why Jobs used to said ""the death is the great invention"" because we are forced to step forward by death.<p>I think it's not about religious thing, it's about philosophy every one should have.<p>For me, it's not important whether Jobs is a kind of Buhddhist or not. He taught us ""to release past"". That's a most important thing.",1319963621

As someone who has also done his fair share of low-level/high-performance programming in C++, I would take some convincing that the result isn't going to be somewhat faster but effectively write-only code. That might be OK if you know your target platforms well enough to count on those micro-optimisations not being premature <i>and</i> you know no-one is going to care about maintaining your code for very long, which is not entirely unrealistic in the games industry but doesn't apply to much else.<p>However, I think a lot of the ideas on those ""slides"" go beyond Data Oriented Design as the term has come to be used, and into general low-level, architecture-specific optimisations. There's nothing wrong with exploring the latter, of course, but I'm not sure it's helpful to conflate very fine-grained, platform-specific, relatively localised adjustments with a high-level view of how to group multiple properties on a set of objects in memory, or with the more general principle of transforming your data in advance into some format that lends itself to the kind of processing you want to do.<p>(None of which is to say that articles on how to do that sort of low-level optimisation on popular platforms wouldn't be interesting. I'm just suggesting that they would probably have to go some way beyond what is commonly called DOD today before they were likely to get interesting.)",1319961601

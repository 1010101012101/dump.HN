I'm not saying a <i>good</i> manager isn't valuable; on the contrary, I think good management is essential. I'm just saying it's a different, parallel track to technical work, but a lot of people (particularly not very good managers) seem to see it as a technical track that stops at about the level where the management track starts.",1283014721

You have a promise for all patents necessary to implement the standard.  If you have questions, I'd just contact them directly.

1641952,comment,1641713,1641713,0,0,pavlov,,,"David Moser's essay <i>Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard</i> [1] has an amusing and enlightening passage about this ""character amnesia"".<p><i>I have seen highly literate Chinese people forget how to write certain characters in common words like ""tin can"", ""knee"", ""screwdriver"", ""snap"" (as in ""to snap one's fingers""), ""elbow"", ""ginger"", ""cushion"", ""firecracker"", and so on. And when I say ""forget"", I mean that they often cannot even put the first stroke down on the paper. Can you imagine a well-educated native English speaker totally forgetting how to write a word like ""knee"" or ""tin can""? Or even a rarely-seen word like ""scabbard"" or ""ragamuffin""? I was once at a luncheon with three Ph.D. students in the Chinese Department at Peking University, all native Chinese (one from Hong Kong). I happened to have a cold that day, and was trying to write a brief note to a friend canceling an appointment that day. I found that I couldn't remember how to write the character 嚔, as in da penti 打喷嚔 ""to sneeze"". I asked my three friends how to write the character, and to my surprise, all three of them simply shrugged in sheepish embarrassment. Not one of them could correctly produce the character. Now, Peking University is usually considered the ""Harvard of China"". Can you imagine three Ph.D. students in English at Harvard forgetting how to write the English word ""sneeze""??</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html</a>",1283014396

In this case, the person 35 would have been better off starting a grass mowing service at age 18 so that by age 35 they have had 17 years in the business, expanded to landscape architecture, have 12 employees, etc.  Or generally a Ph.D. in EE will be better off at age 35 having just gotten an electrician's license and built a nice collection of local customers.<p>Generally, in a technical field, it's important to need a LICENSE.<p>Generally the big, secret economic opportunity now in the US is to exploit a 'geographical barrier to entry'.

Build up to 10 McDonald's, run them WELL, and will have a better job than nearly anyone in a company a programmer might work for.<p>Fifth, a good programmer should start and own their own business.  E.g., really good at Web site design and construction?  Fine:  Do such sites for companies in a radius of 50 miles.  There, of course, need to meet face to face with the customer and, thus, have a geographical barrier to entry.<p>Sixth, have some deep technical qualifications, say, from grad school?

1641912,comment,1641763,1641763,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Management error #1: ""Move up the ladder into management, architecture, or design""<p>As long as management insist on perceiving themselves as superior to other people, and assuming that technical competence somehow implies management competence, there will always be a drain on the good technical guys. The reward and recognition structure strongly encourages them to change discipline. However, can anyone cite me a <i>single</i> source that justifies this position? I'm not sure that any company I've worked for, of any size, really got more value from its middle managers than from the senior technical people it keeps trying to turn into middle managers.<p>The assumption that architecture/design is more important than front-line coding is also dubious. A good architect/designer is worth their weight in gold on a large project (just like a <i>good</i> manager), and to be sure you probably need a fair bit of experience to be any good at all in that sort of role. But that just means the low end of the scale for that role is higher, it doesn't mean the high end of the scale for front-line coding jobs has to be lower. All the evidence I've ever seen still says an expensive, high-end front-line coder is disproportionately productive compared to a cheap, lower-end worker. You can have the best project management and the best design in the world, but if all the guys implementing it are chumps, your project is still going to suck.<p>Management error #2: ""Even though you may be highly experienced and wise, employers aren’t willing or able to pay an experienced worker twice or thrice what an entry-level worker earns.""<p>That's because they're dumb... Maybe because they got too many technical people to do their management instead of people who are actually knowledgeable about and good at management? Project costs scale disproportionately with team size/structure. Developer productivity scales disproportionately with experience. How is it that so many companies can't do the basic arithemtic required to see the implications?<p>Management error #3: ""This means keeping up-to-date with the latest trends in computing, programming techniques, and languages, and adapting to change.""<p>This is not an error in itself.

Because the CP states that the promise is irrevocable, it may not be withdrawn by Microsoft. The CP is, and will be, available to everyone now and in the future for the specifications to which it applies. As stated in the CP, the only time Microsoft can withdraw its promise against a specific person or company for a specific Covered Specification is if that person or company brings (or voluntarily participates in) a patent infringement lawsuit against Microsoft regarding Microsoft’s implementation of the same Covered Specification.

The last time I spent a significant amount of time in front of the TV was the Olympics whose coverage was so bad I ended up fast forwarding though most of it.  The only advantage of cable is they live HDTV programming is less compressed than most streaming options.  Yet, for some reason even their Video on Demand option is more compressed than live tv even though they have a full fiber network.<p>As to programming, I used to watch a fair amount of edutainment like NOVA but even that has been dumbed down to meaningless drivel.  I can still get into a good nature show in HDTV, but mostly they are just Steve Erwin style psudo reality TV designed to maximize the number of teeth shown per minute.<p>PS: If you have not seen it ""How Its Made"" is still fairly interesting.",1312984745

2868161,comment,2867935,2868101,5,0,Udo,,,"Yes. The lower traffic your site is, the easier you can make the captcha. The truth is, most of us have pretty low traffic sites with no more than 100k hits per month, blogs for example. The key here is to have a simple <i>but different</i> captcha compared to the standard stuff. Pairing this strategy with a little bit of site-specific domain knowledge goes a long way towards discouraging trolls and idiots.<p>I think overall, bots would be negatively impacted by a more diverse captcha ecosystem even if the individual implementations are easier to crack. Spammers don't invest 10 or 20 minutes in cracking a domain-specific captcha system just so they can spam one single blog - they'd rather move on to thousands of sites that are protected by the same standard word reading puzzle. Of course, if your site rises into the upper strata of the web, you're also quickly entering a zone where the standard, hard-to-decipher image strategy isn't working so great anymore either.",1312984376

I don't know. But I find it plausible that, say worms, are not really sentient. And from that perspective it's pretty ok to eat worms. Since I do not know where to draw the line, I play safe and avoid meat, but others would choose differently.<p>Some of my friends are also vegetarians, not because they think killing animals is wrong, but because they believe animal farming has a negative impact on the environment.

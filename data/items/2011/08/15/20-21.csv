2888679,story,,,1,0,bijanbwb,"Ask HN: Co-founder Search.",,"Hi there HN community,<p>I've been a long time reader, and for the first time I'm actually writing in hopes of participating.<p>I'm looking for a similar-minded person (or persons) to help co-found a small team with me to work on small software projects of our own choosing. I've been working the 9 to 5 life for three years since leaving college, and if you ask me that's three years too many. I've been fascinated with entrepreneurship and the startup community for quite some time. But I've come to find that reading about entrepreneurship and the software community doesn't necessarily make you part of it. It seems that learning and doing are quite different things.<p>Basically I just want to create, and I don't want to do it alone. I'm something of a generalist when it comes to technology, which means I jump from one thing (language, project, etc.) to another. That makes it difficult to delve deep enough to finish up any truly great final products. Hopefully if we can work as a team we can make something truly engaging.<p>About Me: I'm 27 and I graduated in 2007 with a Degree in Computer Science/English Literature from the University of Miami, which is also where I currently work full time.<p>Technology Background: I'm hoping for someone who loves the same technology that I do, and would prefer to work in similar environments that I have grown to love. I'm pretty open to using whatever platform works, but I've found the following to be particularly engaging: Ruby on Rails, jQuery, Github, Vim, Textmate. Aside from Web Apps, I also really like the idea of doing some Mobile work as well. I've always loved Apple and pretty much everything they do, and I'm currently delving into Xcode and iOS development as well.<p>Furthermore, I would assume that co-founders probably work best if they have some common interests... 37signals philosophies, Apple (and Steve Jobs), GTD, Malcolm Gladwell, Paul Graham's writings, Seth Godin, TEDTalks. If you don't like some of this stuff, it's certainly not a deal-breaker. The only real must is that I'd like someone with a sense of humour (although you don't have to spell ""humour"" the same pretentious way that I do, with an entirely unnecessary 'u').<p>As for my motivation? I'm absolutely sick of being this guy...\nhttp://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/19888/ship-early-ship-never<p>Anyway, if you share some of the same interests that I do, I'd love to hear from you. You can always post a reply here on HN, or you're more than welcome to get in touch with me at bijanbwb@gmail.com.<p>-Bijan",1313441968

2888615,comment,2888370,2888370,0,0,TheSkeptic,,,"""We treat this entire idea purely as a bonus in the unlikely even of a future sale/IPO.""<p>At far too many companies, equity is seen by the employer and employee as a form of cash-equivalent compensation, even though it isn't unless that equity has an income stream attached to it (as would be the case in, say, a grant of restricted stock in a company that pays dividends). So it's somewhat refreshing to see a high-profile tech company eschewing this.<p>The problem here is that 37signals' ""plan"" lacks all substance. The company doesn't intend to go public or seek acquisition, and its ""bonus pool"" is potentially limited to just 5% of any acquisition price.<p>As such, this ""plan"" doesn't promote retention the way equity does, and for all intents and purposes, it doesn't promote much of anything as the savvy employee will never expect it to bear any fruit.<p>Put differently, this ""plan"" feels sort of like an equity version of a poorly-made Louis V. knock-off. While, to its credit, 37signals' isn't pitching this as a justification for a less-than-market salary, there's a strong argument to be made that offering an equity substitute like this is <i>worse</i> than not offering equity at all.<p>The better approach for a company like 37signals? Make sure salaries are highly-competitive, offer an attractive benefits package and, if you want employees to feel like they have a direct ""stake"" in the company's success, implement a profit sharing plan. The benefit of this approach is that you attract the type of employee who wants to work at a company like yours without creating any confusion on trying to pretend that you're offering something that you're not willing to offer.",1313441148

2888611,comment,2886549,2887305,2,0,AgentConundrum,,,"This is my biggest problem with Firefox. Up until Thursday, I was still running 3.6 because I really dislike dealing with add-on issues during upgrades. When a new version of Firefox comes out, I tend to backup my install, upgrade to see how badly it breaks, then revert back out to the older version.<p>When I finally upgraded to v5, I spent a solid hour trying to get the thing back into a workable state.<p>The biggest mistake I ever made with Firefox was installing Tab Mix Plus, because now I have easily manageable rows of tabs, which led me to using tabs as ephemeral bookmarks - things I want to read but not now. I currently have 175 tabs open (and no, I don't complain about memory usage - it's not that bad and I know what usage there is is my own fault).<p>To keep things in check, I use an extension called BarTab, which keeps tabs unloaded on restart until I switch to that tab. Upon upgrading to FF5, that extension broke horribly, leading all of my tabs to fire at once. Turning off compatibility checking didn't fix it, and neither did installing a beta version upgrade to the extension. In the end, I had to go searching the extension library until I found something called BarTab Lite, which worked.<p>Also, my theme was incompatible with Firefox >=4, but I resigned myself to just deal with it, since I was tired of being made fun of for not upgrading a not-quite-five-months out-of-date browser (the community seems to be becoming one of the worst parts of Firefox). Eventually, I found a new theme, which was a non-linked upgrade to my old one. It would be nice if that was a little more obvious.<p>That was a long winded way of saying I'd like to see more explicit links between extensions. Rather than saying ""there are no upgrades for this broken extension"", I'd prefer that there be a way to identify ""spiritual successors"" so that Firefox can tell you ""it's got a different name, but this is where extension Foo lives now.""<p>It would have saved me a lot of time and trouble, because as it stands right now it seems a lot of broken extensions don't have upgrades when really they do - they're just hidden and you need to spend some time looking for them.<p>(Sorry.. /rant)",1313441088

I couldn't find any mention of government need. He's not saying that the super rich should pay more because it's needed.

Note that if he's arguing for specific policy, it might be that he personally ends up paying no more, or even less. If this is his thesis, then how much he or his buddies actually end up paying has nothing to do with it. He should describe what exactly would be ""fair"".<p>There's no argument here, really. It's just Buffett saying he should pay more of his fair share and some friendly poking at the Republicans.

But it was a much needed solution. I was referring to innovations that originated in the Illumos code base such as ZFS, DTrace, zones, doors, crossbow, ctf, least-privilege, etc. All of these are either unavailable on most systems, have inferior clones (i.e. systemtap, btrfs), or are partially available (the Mac DTrace port doesn't have a complete, systemic scope, due to Apple's classist tendencies, and most of the kernel providers like fsinfo are missing, for example).<p>Either way, I still maintain that Illumos is a nexus of systems innovation compared to other kernels, based on how much innovative technology originated in the Illumos kernel, before being ported to or reimplemented on other kernels (the Slab Allocator is an example of a technology that originated in this code-base and has been reimplemented on almost all other kernels; ZFS and DTrace are examples of technologies that have been ported over to some other kernels, albeit with less functionality/stability).<p>Also, the release of Illumos-KVM (among other improvements in the last year) only goes to show that Illumos is still innovating in various ways, while other kernels are either still catching up (I believe that FreeBSD didn't support DTrace'ing userland apps until their 2009 release) or losing differentiators (linux just lost KVM). Seeing as how the Illumos project has quite a bit of engineering talent and corporate investment behind it, I doubt that the rate of innovation will drop below that of other kernels... in fact it might just increase, now that potential contributors know that Oracle/Sun doesn't have a monopoly",1313438811

Something that is pretty much guaranteed to depreciate, but at least I'll get some use value out of it in the meantime. (This is why when Britain had top tax rates close to 100%, people bought Bentleys and Rolls-Royces.) When investment is taxed at punitive rates, consumption becomes more attractive.",1313438559

The commonest is when your parents choose your residency and/or citizenship after your birth. In that case, your parents or guardians are contracting for you, exercising their power of custody. No further explicit action is required on your part to continue the agreement, and you may end it at any time by departing and renouncing your citizenship.<p>Immigrants, residents, and visitors contract through the oath of citizenship (swearing to uphold the laws and constitution), residency permits, and visas. Citizens reaffirm it in whole or part when they take political office, join the armed forces, etc. This contract has a fairly common form: once entered into, it is implicitly continued until explicitly revoked. Many other contracts have this form: some leases, most utility services (such as phone and electricity), etc.</i>",1313438458

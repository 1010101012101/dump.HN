I can't remember if Shirky uses a thought experiment in his original article, but even if he does, I don't see it as being particularly relevant.<p>As to you wanting to short our (yet inexistent stock) - well, I can see you're upset, but isn't that a bit harsh?",1246809239

688344,comment,687612,688076,0,0,DannoHung,,,"Yes, here's my reasoning: The Government has the ability to hire subject matter experts on a wide range of issues.  They come up with plans to spend it and compete with each other about whose plan is the best and try to make compelling arguments to elected or appointed officials to get funding.  The inefficiencies come from the inevitable systematic abuses of bureaucracy: nepotism, greed, personal interest, etcetera etcetera.  But, they still end up doing something and it's at least been thought through.<p>Now, we come to my spending.  I'll go through several hypothetical situations.<p>First, no income tax has been taken from me at all:  I spend the money on stupid garbage (video games, comic books, movies, camera equipment, etcetera) or squirrel it away in an investment (as I noted, nice to have more, but I'm making investments anyway).  The common good is not served, I have more stuff I probably don't need anyway, the world falls into chaos.<p>Second, I don't get to spend my taxed money on myself, but have to spend it towards the common good as I so choose: I put it towards a pet project that I think is worthwhile.  In my case, it would be to sponsor free programming education for kids.  I always thought the computer classes in school were lame and I'd like to see kids get a better introduction at a young age.  Scale this up by 300 million people: Nice sounding projects to feed the homeless and provide specialized education to kids and plant gardens etcetera are supremely well funded, but there's no public police department, no public fire department, no public roads, public transportation, center for disease control, EPA, FDA, and all the other acronyms that ensure that you don't get fucking raped by some business that has enough money to buyout the private landowners to do whatever the fuck it wants to do.<p>Finally, I'm tasked with spending the money in such a way as to form the most ideal society as possible:  Shit, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, can't someone else take care of this?  Thus, the government.<p>So, no, I would definitely be more incompetent than the government when it comes to using money for the common good.  I would be terrible.<p>Also, don't go telling me that the private sector would be better at it, because brother, I've worked in a private organization that's as large as a small government, and they are filled to the fucking BRIM with bullshit.<p>Personally, I've always been of the mind that we should be working on automated systems to handle this sort of thing.  Cold, unfeeling automata dedicated towards the most efficient dispersal of public funds.  Unmotivated by emotional pleas and the suffering of the individual.  Steely, ruthless, determined.<p>But no one else seems to like that idea and I don't know how to build it.",1246809219

I am having a hard time coming up with a scenario where I'd want a flying car (or roadable aircraft).<p>I hate to be a Debby Downer, but:<p>Every pound matters in a light airplane. Why would I want to saddle the flying portion of my trip with all the weight from the safety features designed to protect me on the road or meet federal crash standards, etc? All that weight means more drag, which means lower performance (of at least one of the speed, climb, range, runway required, and/or fuel efficiency variety)<p>Every pound also matters differently when dealing with the road portion of that vehicle's life. How much mass and engineered passive safety features do I need to protect me from yuppies holding a phone in one hand, a latte in the other and driving with their knees? What happens when a minor fender-bender 600 miles from home means I can't fly home?<p>My plane (a light, slow single engine Cessna 182) can already beat the airline's time door-to-door from my house in Cambridge to most destinations east of the Mississippi and north of Myrtle Beach. (It can't touch them on cost on most routes, but neither will the Transition...)<p>Is a roadable car going to shave any time off that? To do so, it would have to be faster in flight, take less time to unfold the wings than it does to pack my airplane, or take less time to secure the wings than it does to hop in a rental car which usually meets me right on the ramp.<p>Need fuel? Call the airport and it'll be fueled and ready for you. Need minor maintenance or even the annual inspection? Pick up the phone, tell them what you need and when you need it. No need to arrange a ride to the airport to drop off and then another to pick-up your roadable aircraft.<p>Then there's the matter of cost: My airplane cost me well under $70K. All my cars together over a lifetime, including 2 classic Mustangs, haven't cost more than $60K total. Add in a $40K hangar at the airport and my total cost for 5 cars, an airplane, and a hangar is still under what the Transition costs. (Yes, there's new vs used pricing mixed in there. That's an accurate reflection of what the Transition is up against though: the capabilities and market for used and new aircraft and cars.)<p>I just can't see it happening as a significant economic win. I'm sure the Terrafugia guys can make it happen technically, just as Eclipse did with their ""million dollar"" jet.",1246807856

Investing gets you some of that interest income to offset inflation.<p>If there was no throttler such as a fiat currency then everyone would have gold holdings.  This means that just holding onto your money is more lucrative than investing in many types of investments.<p>In fact some people put money in gold for that very reason today. So just keeping your money in gold would be an investment rather than taking risk to invest, especially in a time of recession or depression.<p>So sure you might have a bigger return on investment on some things but you are not separating or stretching your gold any more than other people can.<p>Fiat currencies and inflation as well as interest fuel and force investment. I think that can be good, it sure leads to more economics and money movement.<p>People can still put their money in gold, savings, or other currencies but this is sort of a negative motivator when things like savings accounts or money markets pay less than inflation.

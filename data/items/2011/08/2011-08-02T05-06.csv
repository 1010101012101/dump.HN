That is to say, given the choice any ""smart"" business will leap at the chance to lock out competition, because that is in the best interests of the business (if it can get away with it)?<p>Anyway, what this is really about is getting the information <i>faster</i>. I don't really see anything wrong with that; some information is just time sensitive, and a good informant will practically be in the <i>business</i> of getting you information faster than his competitors... I see this as much the same thing.",1312264764

I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to have the static elements (buildings, tree trunks, ground, debris, etc etc) of a level rendered using this tech, and polygons used for everything else. It used to be this way in the bad old days (Doom etc) - Polygons for level structure and sprites for animation. This would at least free up the ""polygon budget"" to improve the features which couldn't be voxel-based.<p>If anything you could create a pretty interesting art style with hyper-realistic backgrounds and cel-shaded characters, or similar. Even as a replacement for pre-rendered background scenery or out-of-level elements it would be useful.<p>And (thinking of the Game of Thrones titles story) whatever mojo they've got must surely be able to be applied to other industries, eg.

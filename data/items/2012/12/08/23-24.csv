4893197,comment,4893121,4893121,2,0,polyfractal,,,"Proactiv is pretty good stuff.  Some important points to understand about acne:<p>- Acne is basically the result of your sebaceous glands (pores) becoming clogged.  These pores secrete waxy oil onto your skin, but when they get clogged (from too much oil, or dirt), the pore fills up with bacteria.  This is a whitehead.  Blackheads are just oil + dirt and no bacteria.<p>- By time you get a whitehead...you're too late.  Most people think whiteheads are the problem.  They are actually just the symptom.  The whitehead has been ""brewing"" for a couple of days to a week.<p>- What this means is that acne control isn't about treating your whiteheads, but being proactive (heh) about preventative treatment.  Clean your face with gentle soap designed for sensitive facial skin, use toner to tighten pores, apply benzyl peroxide to help prevent bacterial colonization.<p>- At least for me, diet had a HUGE effect on my acne.  Eating crappy food and not drinking enough water almost always resulted in an outbreak of acne a week later.  Even in college, all-nighters and fast food would lead to some acne in a few days.<p>- A lot of people think ""Acne!  Must scrub my face to pieces!""  Not true.  Acne can be caused by an abundance of oil...but can also be caused by dry skin.  As you dry your skin out scrubbing, your face increases oil production and you get more acne.<p>- Some people have more sensitive skin than others.  What works for me may not work for you.  Try a variety of products and routines to see what works the best.  I had good luck with morning applications of benzyl peroxide, and salicylic wash at night to help cut through the day's oil.",1355011119

The only health topics I think are relevant here are work-related or cognitive.<p>Regardless, many people on reddit have said that using a clean towel on your pillow for sleeping can make acne go away.

The only number in my example that is Japanese-origin is ""yon""[0], which is interchangeable with ""shi"" (the on'yomi equivalent) in many contexts.<p>> Using the shortest forms of the kun readings, it would be ""ya, fu, yo, mu, na, i, hito"".<p>Those readings are not used to count by native Japanese speakers (I speak Japanese and have lived in Japan), and I can't think of any examples off the top of my head where they would be used on their own.<p>> I don't know if a typical Japanese speaker would memorize them that way, but since those forms are ingrained in the language, they should be able to do so without significant effort.<p>They do not.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.syvum.com/cgi/online/serve.cgi/squizzes/japanese/japanese_kanji_characters_3.html?table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.syvum.com/cgi/online/serve.cgi/squizzes/japanese/...</a>",1355011054

You probably saw a redneck family and immediately assumed the show centers entirely around the popular stereotypes and tropes of that subset of society. While it's certainly not lacking in the aforementioned, the show explores a far wider range of subject matter than you'd probably care to give it credit for.<p>While any show running for so long has hit-and-miss episodes, overall the the show is very well rounded - it explores controversial subjects with care and grace, while remaining funny and heartwarming. And yes, the humor can be quite dry. It's not for kids with short attention spans and who need constant gag after gag, i.e. Family Guy. In most episodes it's difficult to discern whether the moralistic views are real ""American values"" or a parody of them. It's much more about episode-long deep satire than one-off jokes.",1355010547

Those are areas where I think easy gains can be made, even when forgetting about the elephant in the room 'get out of your car', which, apparently, is very hard to do for many people.<p>And, as with all dieting related stuff, for most people, there is no need for drastic action. Gaining 3 grams of body weight per day brings you 20 kg extra body weight going from 20 years to 40 years of age; that is what happens to most people. Your diet/exercise plan, similarly, is good enough if it leads to 3 grams of weight loss a day.",1355010513

So if you aren't counting calories, you're much more likely to eat less on a low carb and high fiber diet.<p>Regardless of what you do, counting calories will probably be the most effective method for losing weight.

Of all the US personnel I have met in Afghanistan, fewer than a handful were engineers, makers, creators rather than enforcers, money dispensers, or supervisors.  Sure, the military has its own engineers, but very few are outside the wire interacting with people.  Where are the civil communication, construction, mechanical, etc. engineers?  I think there is a larger role in global peer to peer diplomacy for such a cadre.  I've got more stories to tell, so does @trevore, some of them are posted jalalagood.com/ --> more will come out guided by the questions you ask.",1355008503

Other ways of understanding the world include our five senses but also rely on other phenomena, such as our dreams and emotions, and then are subject to somewhat rational but mostly irrational personal and subjective interpretations.  Note that irrational is not the same as incorrect, and I don't consider it a pejorative.<p>I guess as a primary example, art is non-scientific, but it is an equally valid way of communicating the understanding of our experience to others.  We understand beauty.  The meaning of symbols in our society seems unlikely to ever come under some scientific theory but forms a very large part of our experience.  The search for meaning in life is not a scientific one.<p>It is probably true that science is the only objective, factually accurate, rational, logical, and methodical approach to understanding the world.

On the other hand, the CFJ system doesn't always get it right (in quite a few instances, later cases have struck down precedent without any particular reason that the answer should have changed - some cases are paid more careful attention than others, and sometimes emotion affects it in the case of scams), and often facts that seem completely self-evident to one person end up getting disputed (I've had this happen to me and observed it in others).

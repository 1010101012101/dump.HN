4118682,comment,4118122,4118368,1,0,novalis,,,"Funny how I always had that ""it just works"" feeling from the machines I build and never got the same feel from any brand available. This feeling is also helped by being able to choose the hardware at the time of build and not some middle of the road to high end options given by a manufacturer that simply overprices said ""options"" and makes wild claims about it. Plus, I always find it a joy to know the machine down to the bolt and not having to fall back on weird care guarantees. With the exception of servers that have to be serviced by a third party because of scale and time economy, this simply works for me. I don't see how microsoft can one up that, but hey, you never know. Hope it at least allows for some people to try it.",1339793897

To be honest I'm more than happy to give someone half my work if they are talented. Are you making this point because...<p>A) The overhead is so low that you want ""full stack"" people to keep margins low (so by wouldn't dream you actually mean wouldn't expect).<p>B) You want people that are willing to silo themselves, not incorporating exterior feedback or following direction from someone that may have a better handle on the given task.<p>Wanting someone that does full-stack is nice, but do you REALLY want someone like that and WHY. I mean, this sentence ""you dont flinch at the idea of writing largely PHP for a living"" flies right in the face of everything else. It is like saying the following:<p>Do you dream of creating time-tested architectures? Do you spend nights dreaming up the next great cathedral or monument? That's cool, so we want you to put in our bathroom tile.<p>You are asking for a dreamer, an innovator, a creator, a designer and an architect to .... primarily ... write .... php .<p>With that said, it is written very well and etsy is a pretty cool company so I'm sure you'll get plenty of hits.",1339793855

I think that your listing and subsequent clarification might suggest to many that all of the above are inadequate, and I imagine you may be turning off several (very good) candidates that doubt their own full-stack-worthiness, merely on account of the term here being so nebulous.<p>In other words, to any given pair of eyes that fall upon the ad, all they know is that you want everything.",1339793841

Having said that, there's no doubt you're given the ability to do a lot more around enforcing structure with constructs such as abstract classes or interfaces. the timing of this post is interesting as I recently put a project up on github (<a href=""https://github.com/vannatech/blade"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vannatech/blade</a>) for essentially coding JavaScript in a .NET-ish environment. I think maybe even as valuable as some of the thing strong typing brings is the ability to make use of the IDE (you get Visual Studio, assembly referencing etc). For building reusable components I feel like it's definitely the way to go. For annotating a page to add UI features, I'd push for JS. Then there's a lot of area between that where it could vary depending on other factors. Overall I can agree on some levels with the post. But I think, as in most things, it's important to understand the underlying technologies. Abstracting away JavaScript and the browser related APIs will inevitably lead to bad results.",1339793408

What their ultimate strategy is remains to be seen but my guess is that if they are branding and distributing the hardware it's as a result of lackluster interest among consumer electronics companies in manufacturing such a device.<p>Such disinterest, if it is the case, isn't particularly surprising given the consumer market's acceptance of Android driven tablets, and it may be reasonable to see Microsoft choosing to take on the hardware side for the sake of conducting research (ala' KIN).<p>Alternatively, a Windows 8 tablet under the XBox brand makes a lot of sense given the success of that franchise and the level of acceptance that console competitors have achieved with portable gaming devices...e.g. Gameboy and PSP. A gaming focused marketing strategy has a lot going for it - ""Mom, I can even do my homework on it because it comes with Word"" and integration with XBox Live is already part of the Windows Phone 7 Gaming Hub.<p>I suspect that a gaming focused device would match up pretty well against the iPad (and Android) because XNA offers a way of facilitating cross platform development. On a larger front, integration of a tablet with Kinnect would offer the potential for some really interesting applications out in the workplace.",1339793387

No, because you are not compelled to purchase it. This isn't like when AT&T leased phones, or MS forced OEMs to include Windows on all their systems (and had a >95% market share). Apple has no monopoly, they have no special sway with corporations and gov't (in fact, their absence in those fields and success despite it is somewhat remarkable and speaks well to their business acumen).

Press helps but they are usually ""nice to have"" but whatever if you don't have them. Unless you're a well funded company doing something with a lot of famous names behind your product, generally speaking, getting techcrunched, etc... brings a singular traffic spike to your site and many may not even convert. Although this is not true in all cases, long story short, don't place bets on press. They're nice if you got them but place your bets in better medians.<p>2. Be creative in how you aim to market your startup. For us, we didn't even get techcrunched until the day we were acquired and we never got coverage on any of the other press sites you listed. That didn't change anything. I believe Alexis Ohanian (founder of Reddit, Breadpig, and Hipmunk) said something similar. Their entire marketing budget they ever spent was a whooping $500 on stickers of the Reddit alien that they use to spread all over town.<p>In our case, we were in a very niche market so we spent $400 asking for a legitimate paid review (with full disclosure and allowing the reviewer to bash us for any and all negative points if there were some) from a top blogger in our niche to reach relevant audience (was well spent) and aside from that, paying for tables and booths twice a year at a targeted conference to exhibit for our product (also well spent). Some of these things are not as expensive as they seem. That said, MAJORITY of our users and marketing channels were 100% free, especially in the early stages. We focused heavily on getting the community to help spread the world. Word of mouth is often beaten to a pulp and taken out of context. The best thing you could do is get connected to all your users and do a great job for them and let those with social influence do their thing. Find out who the top influencers are in your industry and reach out, you'll be surprise how many of them are willing to give feedback and even spread the word to their friends. Its the best way to get going in the early days.<p>3. The earlier you are in your startup, the less you should try to blow up in explosive growth. Getting attention can also have major negative consquences too. See Color. Being a startup means you have the opportunity to roll out your product slowly and test and improve constantly before it reaches the masses. Sometimes its worth getting that explosive growth a year later, etc... Just something to think about. Right now, if I were you, I would focus 100% on the community, forget the fancy marketing tactics or press. They're not what makes your business.",1339792120

More specifically they set up coding wars where different programmers at different companies assigned to the same task independently.<p>They found 10x differences in time spent on the average coding war (which was typically a pretty small sample) with those finishing faster typically producing programs that worked better.  So by any reasonable measure, at least 10x productivity.<p>There is your 10x, right?  Wrong.  They found that the best predictor of programmer performance was the performance of another programmer at the same company.  Furthermore they managed to correlate a lot of that performance factor to specific factors, such as having a phone that turned off, a private room, adequate desk space, and so on.  There was still something like an unexplained factor of 3 left over, but they didn't know whether it was environment variables they had not looked at (eg training), individual ability (which might be correlated across institutions), etc.<p>It is true that this research happened in the 80s, before the Internet was widespread.

Many will of course argue that Linux is great and is an obvious choice, which would be a fair enough argument, but for the larger majority of the population who know Windows and don't want to learn something new, the manufacturers will need to stick with Windows or risk alienating those potential customers.<p>Also, the argument is predicated on the assumption that this is a zero sum game. Microsoft's value proposition isn't suddenly going to be so amazing that no consumer will purchase a non-Microsoft PC.

Here's Eric Sink, urging you to start a company in a field where there are already competitors:<p><a href=""http://www.ericsink.com/Choose_Your_Competition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ericsink.com/Choose_Your_Competition.html</a><p>""The big problem with avoiding competition is that you are also avoiding customers. The existence of a competitor indicates the existence of paying customers. If you can't find anyone who is making money with your idea, you really need to wonder if there is any money to be made there at all.""<p>Let's consider the original article's example: cloning Flickr. There may be lots of good reasons to clone Flickr. It's a really new idea, and we haven't had much time to explore the space. For all we know, there might be all sorts of niche markets for Flickr-like services: Flickr for amateur baseball, Flickr for fashion designers, Flickr for medical illustrators, Flickr for architects. Each of these apps might have slightly different features (perhaps Flickr-for-architects would allow you to estimate the sizes of rooms by pointing at the corners of various objects in the photo, or provide various easy-to-use UI elements for matching photos with locations on a floor plan), and each would certainly be sold to a different market (or else they would likely fail -- in the Generic Photosharing market, they risk being crushed by Flickr itself). But there's no reason why they should not all coexist, just as the existence of Starbucks does not, in fact, doom all other coffeeshops everywhere to extinction.<p>Now, if you clone Flickr but don't add a differentiator, that's probably a mistake. And if you clone Flickr but don't have a revenue model that will keep you afloat, that's a mistake. [1] But there's no reason to expect successful businesses to be <i>novel</i>. Novelty is irrelevant. Only <i>making money</i> is relevant.<p>[1] This is the real reason why it's easy to laugh at many of the Flickr clones: Many of them have also cloned Flickr's revenue model, which involves being acquired by a company that has deep pockets and a large number of servers. It seems unlikely that this plan will work out for everyone...",1214323198

If you’re investing for the long haul, you still need to have stops in place and contingincies written out.</i><p>I love the idea that stop-loss orders are somehow part of 'investing'. So here's your scenario: you are analyzing ABC Co., which trades at $5. A careful assessment of their assets, growth prospects, and management makes it clear to you that the stock is probably worth $10. So you buy at $5. The next day, a well-regarded technical analyst announces that the stock has done a pigeon-toed triple-flopped oat-and-tree formation, and is destined to take a Fibbonacci retracement. The stock drops to $4.00. Suddenly, your 'risk management' system tells you that this stock, which you had purchased for fifty cents on the dollar, is a <i>worse</i> deal because it now trades at <i>forty</i> cents on the dollar.<p>This is like getting rid of all your clothes because a clothing store had a sale.<p>If you're buying because you think you're getting a good business at a fair price, the daily quoted value only tells you whether you can buy more at a good price, or sell some at a good price. It doesn't inform you about business prospects, or changes in the underlying value.<p>Also, buy-and-hold is a myth because of one cherry-picked anecdote? Look at a thirty-year chart of KO, PFE, MO, WMT, and, for that matter, BRK.A.<p>Making good investments is extremely hard. Making satisfactory investments is not nearly so hard. But adding in a bunch of gibberish about managing risk by selling when others panic will never help anyone.",1214320063

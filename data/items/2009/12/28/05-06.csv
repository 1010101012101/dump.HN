1018138,comment,1017932,1018110,0,0,kgrin,,,"El Al is often cited as an example in these discussions, and it's a pretty flawed one.  The reason why profiling <i>works</i> (or at least works better) for El Al is that the demographics of the average traveler to Israel are pretty consistent and predictable, which greatly reduces the search space.<p>For instance, many travelers to Israel go for at least tangentially religious reasons; it's common practice for El Al security to ask those folks some basic questions about the faith (logic: if the guy claiming to be making a religious trip doesn't know something any observant pre-teen would, that guy deserves a closer look).<p>That doesn't mean that everyone traveling to Israel is Jewish (clearly not the case!), or that it's really all about profiling.  But having a more homogeneous and constrained baseline (in addition to a smaller country) makes the ""let's ask you some questions and see if your story makes sense"" approach considerably more scalable.<p>Why does country size matter?  A guy says ""I'm visiting friends... where?  Comstock - it's near Sargent.""  Without Google Maps at the ready, it would be hard to know if that's a plausible travel plan; whereas in a country that's only 8,000 sq. mi., with fewer people than NYC - a security agent is more likely to know shenanigans when s/he hears it.",1261978472

Many years later, after having done various kinds of engineering, I must say I am amazed at living systems. Now I see connections between biological systems and systems engineered by humans. I see feedback loops everywhere. I think in terms of robustness and fragility.<p>Saying that <i>""we have a lot to learn from nature""</i> is almost a vacuous statement. Nature is so complex, that there are billions of opportunities to learn from it and to design bio-inspired systems. An example: neural processing is orders of magnitude more power-efficient that CMOS. Sure, our brain can't do arithmetic at high-speed, but if we lose a bunch of neurons, our brain still works. Humans can literally lose parts of their brain and survive and function. It's amazing. By contrast, a dust particle on a Silicon wafer is enough for a CPU to malfunction.<p>This fascination with nature has a dark side, too. Just because evolution has attained such quasi-perfect designs, it does not mean we can do the same. Neuromorphic electronic systems never got anywhere. People in the 1980s talked so much about analog VLSI and neural networks, and I haven't seen that much coming out of it.<p>The problem with being fascinated by something is that being in awe is not always the most productive way. Sometimes despizing something works much better. Whatever. I am not saying anything deep, and cheap philosophy never got anyone to actual achievement, to building actual things that actually work.

What they do is actually ask you a battery of questions designed to flush out inconsistencies.

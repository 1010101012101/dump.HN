9227397,comment,9225079,9226055,0,0,ffn,,,"This is the classic symptom of changing oneself to fit the mainstream once one hits the mainstream. Whether it&#x27;s EA&#x27;s fault of Maxis&#x27;s fault is just fruitless finger pointing (it&#x27;s EA&#x27;s, these guys are literally the cancer that&#x27;s killing the video game industry), but the real mistake is updating your game to fit &quot;mainstream standards&quot; of connectivity, social, high quality 3d graphics, etc. Some management official or engineer probably sold these ideas as completely required innovations if Simcity wanted to stay competitive with things like facebook or MMOs (i.e. other time-consumers), and everyone just jumped on board.<p>And it&#x27;s that very idea of &quot;we need to stay competitive&quot; that really killed Simcity. Here in capitalist societies, we&#x27;re sold on the idea competition is great, but it&#x27;s not, it assumes the fact the rules stay the same and focuses attention on what our &quot;enemies&quot; are doing. We become obsessed with not doing what we do best, but with doing what we think will beat the others. In Simcity&#x27;s case, it was adopting online connectivity and social interaction despite the fact Simcity is inherently a creative game and not a social one (in fact, unless you&#x27;re a trash-tier mayor, you&#x27;ve spent time researching city layouts, reading through strategies, and possibly even simulating various algorithms and geometries in matlab or whatnot... whereas in a social game, you&#x27;d be spending your time name-calling the other players). Strategies and ideas that emerge from competition focus on trying to capture customers from an adversary, and completely ignores the fact people are complicated, don&#x27;t like change, and that a company can capture them by just being incrementally &quot;better&quot; in some engineering metric.<p>Today, it&#x27;s too late for simcity, but to a new rising city game like skylines, I hope they ignore what &quot;the competition&quot; are doing and just focus on making their fun city building game more fun (e.g. instead of worrying about online, social, or the 2018 version of online-social which will probably be 3d holograms or something, spend time introducing new mechanics like strategic resources, &quot;work from home&quot; algorithms, flying cars, racism / gentrification, etc.)",1426701543

In unix-like systems, file locks (e.g., lockf(3)) are &quot;advisory&quot; rather than mandatory, meaning it&#x27;s up to the higher-layer apps to check whether another program has locked a file and voluntarily stop.<p>Any apps that do implement this feature likely do so by making the original file read-only and having the first app that opens the file work on a copy.

Since 2003 there have been other cases of “super-Y” lineages. For example the Manchu lineage and the Uí Néill lineage. The existence of these Y chromosomal lineages, which have burst upon the genetic landscape like explosive stars sweeping aside all other variation before them, indicates a periodic it “winner-take-all” dynamic in human genetics more reminiscent of hyper-polygynous mammals such as elephant seals. As we do not exhibit the sexual dimorphism which is the norm in such organisms, it goes to show the plasticity of outcome due to the flexibility of human cultural forms.",1426701443

There is a locator beacon function that I would have loved to have on my lost Fenix P2D Q5. Honestly though, if you just want a good flashlight, Fenix and Zebralight are more than good enough. For the woods though, I definitely advise getting the highest CRI you can. The warmer tints usually have better CRI.<p>With standard CRI LEDs (~70 CRI) I experienced a strange effect. Standing in a field and shining the light (Fenix P2D) into the tree line, the treeline and much of the forest behind it would be illuminated enough to make out details, but I could not judge the distance of anything behind the treeline. It was like the treeline was a wall where my depth perception stopped. With my high-CRI LED, even though it is not as bright (120 vs 180 lumens) I am able to see &quot;better&quot;.<p>It is all subjective though. There are some good threads on CPF showing picture comparisons between high and low-CRI. For me though, the differences at the conscious level are very subtle.

But everyone else is hurt by that.<p>Maybe you thought industrious meant inventive, or creative. But if it means only hard working. Then intelligent and hard working is a dangerous combination. Often successful but at a huge cost. Smart and lazy is just as often successful, but without those huge costs.<p>When smart and lazy people get hard work, they think of ways to make it easier.  That&#x27;s where we get the old saying that civilization advances only thanks to lazy people. Hard working people just put up with however hard or inconvenient work is, lazy people get creative.",1426701121

9227337,comment,9220468,9224721,0,0,agentultra,,,"As others have noted and in my own limited experience picking up OCaml -- a static type system does not solve the problem you need unit tests and functional tests for. They&#x27;re good for readability if you explicitly annotate everything (and forgo the type inference) and they&#x27;re good for flushing out a whole class of run-time type errors. But that&#x27;s about all.<p>At this point in my learning it&#x27;s more about pleasing a SAT solver than getting anything useful done... but I&#x27;m sure that will change with time.<p>Common Lisp does have a type system... it&#x27;s just dynamic so you can hit things at run-time. This is great in development because it allows you to under-specify things that aren&#x27;t terribly important (like types) at that time. However when you begin to find your code is ready to be locked in place you can annotate your function to hint to the implementation what the types should be. In particularly well-tested and heavily-typed code you can even turn off dynamic type-checking entirely for your production builds and get the performance boost from that.<p>Regardless of your approach and requirements, tests have a completely different use beyond ensuring type consistency. They set expectations, inform API design, and catch mistakes in refactoring; they act as a specification for the module under test. I&#x27;ve had plenty of OCaml code compile that still failed tests. Even in the presence of strong static typing you need unit, integration, and regression tests.<p>Just food for thought.",1426701087

Spotify even supported Last.FM, I was in heaven... Until Spotify didn&#x27;t have that 1 song, or that 1 cd, or that 1 artist. That coupled with CONSTANTLY turning explicit music on my playlists to the &quot;clean&quot;/&quot;radio edit&quot; versions pissed me off to no end (I know why this is happening and I find it completely unacceptable).<p>For the last few months I&#x27;ve been using SoundCloud (Still paying for Spotify for every now and then or when a friend requests a song) for mashups (which are nowhere to be found on Spotify) but the SoundCloud iPhone is shit. It looks nice but whenever iOS knocks it out of memory it forgets where you were were and takes you back to the home screen (Which for long mashups sucks a lot). Furthermore it seems WAY more finicky with network connections than Spotify was. I have to turn off Wifi when I get in my car (from home -> work and from work -> home) because if I don&#x27;t then SC will try to load over Wifi and I drive out of range almost immediately. Then I have to kill the app and re-launch (and re-navigate to where I was) before it will use my LTE connection.

According to futurists from the 1990s we&#x27;d have the immortality pill, jet packs, Mars colonies, cancer cure, diabetes cure, extinct animal revival, etc by now.<p>In 2035 Musk will be at retirement age, so why is he selling us on this concept now? Obviously, these guys want to push a product out soon and that product is flawed and not remotely ready for, say, Chicago traffic.  I&#x27;m sure its wonderful on the Google campus, but that&#x27;s not my world.<p>I think Musk, being a business man, has an agenda here. Its to keep Tesla&#x27;s largely failed experiment in electric cars going via hype and promises. Everything he says exists to raise the value of his company. The same way he ironically badmouthed &quot;strong&quot; AI recently to discredit robotic space mission funding that would challenge the manned launches SpaceX plans to profit from.<p>I think its funny that Musk flip-flops on AI so easily. Good in cars, bad in space, when in reality the opposite is true.  I think the more extremist Musk gets in the pressm the more we&#x27;re seeing problems at Tesla and his other companies. Take at look a TSLA stock from a 1 year perspective, not to mention their $108m losses this past quarter and $300m loss in the past year. Things have been very bad there.  Musk is just trying to keep it alive via hype and showmanship.<p>Tesla is really starting to feel like Segway.  Musk, for all his merits, is probably best as a space guy and should stick to that. Space needs big thinkers and big disruptors. This is a field where we need good AI and a cost cutting approach, not cars. Focusing on making the best car, in this day and age, is like focusing on making the best horse and buggy 100 years ago. Shame he is wasting so much talent and capital on this quixotic endeavor, especially considering Detroit and Tokyo have their own affordable electrics, if anyone is interested in buying them in the age of the BRICS nations demanding less oil and the price of oil falling to historic lows.",1426699986

I don&#x27;t recall ever choosing to invest in and master a language from a celebrity endorsement. Some people might have -- I can&#x27;t say. But it obviously does have merit because of the responses Carmack&#x27;s tweet solicited so I don&#x27;t disagree.<p>I just found that the majority of responses were of this patronizing sort. If Carmack is amongst the top 1% of programmers, as you say, and is a minor celebrity as we both know then it seems disingenuous to immediately ask him, &quot;Why not Haskell/Erlang/Clojure/Whatever-my-favorite-X-is?&quot; Given his previous essays on functional programming and his move to adopt C++ I think it&#x27;s safe to say he knows what he&#x27;s doing and picked Racket for good reasons (even if it&#x27;s as simple as, &quot;I like it.&quot;). I made the tribe observation when it became apparent to me that perhaps they were jealous that Carmack didn&#x27;t pick their tribe and bring his celebrity power along to them.<p>I find that kind of sad and funny. I&#x27;m more curious as to what he&#x27;s building than what language he&#x27;s using to do it with. There are interesting things to talk about wrt the system he&#x27;s building and the run-time he&#x27;s building it on but that seems to go over the majority of peoples&#x27; heads. Even as a newcomer to the Racket ecosystem I think Carmack will have quite a lot to teach us as he develops this system: about Racket, the language VM, system architecture, his process, etc.<p>So when I said, &quot;As if it matters what language Carmack decides to use,&quot; what I was implying was that he probably has reasons and it&#x27;s more interesting to know what those are. He could have continued writing it in C++, Haskell, anything... it&#x27;s what he does choose, as opposed to the multitude of choices he didn&#x27;t make, that is interesting here in my opinion.",1426699913

Usually the fare is cheaper than a taxi (I don&#x27;t remember ever calling a taxi in Russia).

If the fare is all that matters to a given consumer, then any car/driver will do. If security matters more than fare, then taxis will do. Uber is operating in a gray area between these extremes and as soon as A) we cease fearing our neighbors (I believe that the decline of suburbia and renewed urbanization will eventually take us there) and B) taxi services will begin offering better technical solutions, Uber&#x27;s service will become largely obsolete.",1426698912

He says (paraphrased) &quot;that figure at the bottom at 10 photos per photographer is a lie. it doesn&#x27;t matter...the top 10% of the most prolific photographers account for almost 75% of the photos. 80% of the contributors are below the average amount of contributions&quot; This is Spotify in a nutshell. People wan&#x27;t access to all of the rap music in the world even if they are only going to actually consume 20% of it, so that in the rare chance they listen to one song of the other 80% that it&#x27;s still made available. In other words, the overall utility of Spotify&#x27;s system is only valid when it&#x27;s whole, but the individuals who are necessary for it to be whole are unevenly distributed (in this case number of plays).

A serious accident, for example, will typically only affect a single rider (or group of riders) who can, at most give a zero-star review. I cannot see how the possibility of a single zero-star review out of hundreds would give a driver any incentive to do anything that costs a significant amount of money -- after all, many Uber drivers probably are used to getting the occasional bad review for no reason at all.<p>Edit: Bonus reason #3 -- Situations may arise where the government wants to prevent driver behavior that many riders will approve of, for example, to protect other drivers and pedestrians. For example, the government might want to use licensing to impose an extra stiff penalty on taxi drivers who violate traffic laws (i.e., license revocation or suspension).

Either you are in that group in which all of you make money or you are in the group that you and your friends none make much money....&quot; -alimoeeny<p>This is probably the best take I&#x27;ve read on what is going on. There ARE people who make a lot of money on equity, even as employees. The issue is that there are a lot more people who make nothing. This is actually what is supposed to happen. After all, most businesses fail.<p>If you made money through equity... then obviously the friends you worked with at that company made money too. And if you didn&#x27;t... then your friends, who were at the same company, probably made nothing as well.<p>Just as a matter of full disclosure, I&#x27;ve had two SUPER nice exits. I got them by NOT going out to Silicon Valley to try the internet startup route though. I stayed in the midwest and went the medical imaging route. The thing is this, there were&#x27;t 1000 other companies doing the same thing. So the odds of winning were much higher. So my personal advice would be to look at the KIND of company you&#x27;re getting equity from. Molecular Imaging startup??? Yeah... you&#x27;re probably gonna want as much equity as possible. Yet Another Consumer Web/SmartApp startup??? Your odds of that equity being lucrative are much lower, you should plan accordingly.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s basically a lottery ticket. I got really lucky a couple of times. Others won&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s basically all down to luck of the draw. I just drew a straw from a pool with very few lots.

9226929,comment,9225361,9226774,0,0,charlesdm,,,"You’re right, they can’t. But the question is not so much, what is the actual rate of tax we pay? It’s more along the lines of, how much actual money is being paid? If one considers Amazon, I don&#x27;t think anyone dares say they do not significantly contribute to the UK economy by their presence (directly & indirectly).<p>As long as the rates are not unified globally, there will always be a reason to avoid tax. And for multinationals, there will always be an incentive to do it, because they have massive scale. A 0.1% tax difference might mean millions to them, and it might mean only £100 to you. If the difference is millions, why not set up a small office somewhere?<p>Let’s say you are a ‘tiny’ multinational. You own two shops, one in the UK (20% CT) and one in the France (33% CT). Both shops operate under the same brand. You own  the IP rights to the brand. The sane thing to do here is to have the UK entity own the brand rights, because then you can charge a royalty (say, ~1% of turnover) to your french company.<p>Some people call this avoidance, and not paying your fair share. Sure. But, one company actually owns the rights and the other doesn’t. Should that be a “free” transaction? If you were to license your brand to a third party company in Dubai (not related to yours) to set up another shop, would you also give this for free? That’s part of where the problem lies. Also, if the brand rights would be owned by the french entity, the UK might (will?) now charge a sort of diverted profit tax. For diverting &#x27;profits&#x27; to a higher tax country.<p>Disallowing a deduction because some other connected entity owns the brand is not right, because that means you&#x27;d be getting the brand for free. You&#x27;d actually be paying tax on a profit that did not exist in the first place. Overcharging for brands has never been allowed. Before this DPT tax, it was not allowed either.<p>Now image a large multinational. Luxembourg, for example, charges a net tax rate of ~5% on IP income. I charge the same royalty as tiny multinational. That 1% just became a whole lot bigger. And yet, that’s probably the correct value of the brand. Think about it this way: if you take off the brand, how many units would you sell? That one percent might be tens of millions for a large multinational company.<p>As companies grow in scale, so do their synergies and advantages. Lower tax is one of them, paying less to suppliers is another as is the ability to increase prices.",1426698068

Now, they post these sensationalist headlines (I was expecting it to be a play on words, e.g. it was an article about funeral planning or life insurance), and fan the flames of idiocy with writing like this:<p>&quot;And if you think your own job is safe, think again. New research predicts that nearly half of all jobs are susceptible to automation over the next two decades.&quot;<p>So silicon valley is bad _because_ they find more efficient ways to do things? Should we also be upset with anyone who sells a refrigerator, for making all those poor iceblock-expeditions and milkmen obsolete? Does the &quot;\&quot;sharing economy\&quot;&quot; (my quotes around their quotes, for how much they quote that term) mean that by using our cars, homes, tools, etc. more efficiently, and buying less new stuff, we&#x27;re actually saying &quot;drop dead&quot; to the people who would have manufactured new things?<p>If there&#x27;s a large number of people who hold degrees, who don&#x27;t need the degree for the job they have, isn&#x27;t that a fault with our education system?

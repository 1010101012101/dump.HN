Regardless, what's you opinion about the way programming was taught?</i><p>By the time I started taking classes, I'd already been programming for fun for a while. I continued self-teaching; it was both necessary and entertaining. In class, I was taught the basics of Java, LOGO, MIPS assembly, C++, Scheme, and Prolog, and course material also used BASIC (which my father had taught me), C, and x86 assembly (which I taught myself). The earliest classes spent a lot of time teaching the language, whereas later classes assumed that students either had prior knowledge of it or would learn it on their own (except for Scheme and Prolog since these were expected to be students' first exposure to functional and logical programming). I think the expectation of some self-teaching is really necessary to ensure that students learn to do so before they graduate. Putting together simple building blocks given on lecture slides only takes one so far; eventually, you'll have to do something you didn't learn to do in class.",1285174620

As a professional it's trivial, but if you know nothing about a programming it can be very difficult to get started doing anything.  It's too easy for us professionals to forget how much we know now.<p>Focus more on the performance characteristics and design trade-offs of core algorithms and data structures (e.g., binary search, quicksort, dictionaries, vectors, lists) and less on the nitty gritty of implementing them.<p>Starting with interactive languages like Python that handle garbage collection and have high-level containers built in is also useful.  Noisy stack traces when something goes wrong are also much more accessible than a C or C++ core dump.<p>Another thing that irked me was the expectation that we were already emacs or vi experts!

You ""make partner"" when your colleagues decide they trust you, value your contribution, and would like to keep you on board by sharing profits with you.  Then, everyone is paid a base salary but partners get profit sharing.<p>This solves the main problem of tenure while keeping the spirit and benefits of it.<p>Another idea I had for pay plans is to incentivize teachers to create curriculum materials (this would save huge money on textbooks).  Ideally there would be a network of schools so that if a teacher crated an amazing lesson or book chapter he/she would be paid a bit extra every time it was chosen/used. Enough that a moderately prolific teacher could earn a 20-40% bonus simply via curriculum creation.  Maybe one decides to teach acoustical physics by analyzing a lady gaga song, and the lesson is a huge hit across a thousand schools.<p>In my opinion the ideal teachers are the sort of people capable of creating top quality curriculum... curriculum creation is a natural biproduct of energetic, creative teaching, and a large chunk of the way schools currently allocate money goes into paying textbook firms rather than cultivating a valuable skill in their employees.",1285173146

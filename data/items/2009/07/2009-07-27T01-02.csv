725198,comment,724920,724920,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"I used to be quite successful at lucid dreaming when I was younger and had more time on my hands. One of the most enjoyable experiences was when in one dream I found myself atop a very high multi-level office style building, seemingly around 20-30 stories from my vantage point. I knew I was dreaming, and jumped, knowing full well that I wouldn't die. It felt awesome. I landed at the bottom amid a large pile of cardboard boxes. Perhaps the boxes were my minds way of making my survival of the fall vaguely plausible.<p>I also had a number of dreams where I consciously decided within my dream that I wanted to wake up and did.<p>My strategy for reaching this kind of lucid dreaming was to use a reminder of some kind. I had read that some studies were using a kind of apparatus attached to ones head, like glasses that detected when you had entered REM sleep by the movement of your eyes and turned on and off soft lights pointed at your closed eyes to alert you that you were dreaming.<p>I had nothing so sophisticated, so I went with a simple radio next to my bed, playing softly as I went to sleep. I would at times hear the radio in my dreams and it would alert me that I was in fact dreaming.<p>It's a fascinating area of self exploration that I would recommend to anyone who has the time.",1248659811

Why?  Well, DNA and RNA are self replicators that, to the best of our knowledge, arose independently.  Given that the emergence of self-replicators is improbable to begin with, it's even more improbable that two different types of self-replicators arose that are so similar to each .  This probably means that there is some about the way natural laws are shaped that means that certain types of self-replicators are more probable than others; and those that use heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds as code fall under this category.<p>What about other aspects of life? All large forms of life are modular; that is, composed of many smaller but similar types.  It's likely that alien life will follow this basic structure as well, because it's much easier to evolve that way.  Evolving a larger body without modularity requires fundamental changes in structural composition which may be difficult to achieve with incremental changes.<p>The temptation with exploratory thinking is to deliberately think as much outside the box as you can.

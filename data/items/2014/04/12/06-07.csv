You would appear to have trouble handling rejection (at least I would infer that)<p>No, I&#x27;m just reporting some strong evidence that they\njust don&#x27;t read their e-mail.  Or, to be more clear,\napparently essentially all information technology (IT) VCs will just ignore an e-mail\nmessage saying (generic version; real version\nwith specifics):<p>(1) Here is the problem we are attacking.\nSo far it is easy to see that there is no\ngood solution.  Fairly clearly a good solution\nwill be of high interest to over 80% of all the\nInternet users, work station down to smart phone, in the world.<p>(2) The main reason the problem has remained\nunsolved is that knowing how to solve the problem\nis a challenge.  The team has a new, unique,\npowerful, valuable, rock solid solution that\nhas a high technological barrier to entry.<p>(3) Monetization?  With a few billion unique\nusers a month, for a first cut, just run ads.\nFor more, there is an aspect of the project\nthat permits some especially effective ad \ntargeting with especially good protection of\nuser privacy.<p>(4) The crucial core software implementing the\ntechnology is production quality and scalable.\nThe rest is just an especially simple\nfront-end Web site, nearly done.<p>(5) Team qualifications in business, \nresearch, and software are high.<p>Then with 1-5, they will just ignore the contact.\nNo response.  No questions.  Nothing.  They just\nignore it.  From the claims there, we&#x27;re talking\n$100+ billion exit value; they just ignore it.\nNo response; just toss it into the bit bucket.<p>Look, we&#x27;re talking a billion or more unique\nvisitors a month and an exit value north\nof $100 billion, and they have no response at all.\nStrong evidence that they just ignore their\ne-mail.  Leave a $20 on a sidewalk; a\nguy walks by; the $20 is still there;\nconclusion, he didn&#x27;t see the $20.  Or,\nthe VC firm just didn&#x27;t see the e-mail.<p>One reason is, US IT VCs just have never seen any such\nthing, that is, an IT start up where what is crucial\nis the &#x27;secret sauce&#x27; technology to solve the\nbig problem.  Instead, they pursue only other\nways of making money and where the technology\nis essentially just routine software.  US\nIT VCs and A16Z just will <i>not</i> give any value to\n(that is, won&#x27;t spend time to investigate)\nresults of research in IT -- the DoD is\nawash in valuable results of such research;\nbiotech VC will take research seriously; but\nUS IT VCs haven&#x27;t seen\nany big business success from such research, don&#x27;t\nreally understand research or how to evaluate it,\nwant to pursue other ways of making money,\nand want just to ignore anything based on research.\nThey just want to f&#x27;get about research.\nThat is the obvious explanation.<p>Since the US IT VCs are just determined to ignore\nresearch, the flip side of that is an advantage\nfor any project with some good research.<p>Net, they don&#x27;t read their e-mail and won&#x27;t\nevaluate technology.<p>> - I would suggest they&#x27;re not having trouble handling email...their filtering is working just fine. You would appear to have trouble handling rejection (at least I would infer that)<p>No, the situation is just as I said:  The evidence is\noverwhelmingly strong that they just refuse to \nread e-mail from someone they don&#x27;t know.  That&#x27;s their\nchoice.<p>>  They don&#x27;t necessarily need the deep technical expertise within their team.<p>Yes they do or they are at risk of missing out\non possibly some of the best projects.  As I made\nclear, for the past 10-20 years, information\ntechnology (IT) VCs have not seen big successes based\non anything at the level of publishable technical\nresearch.  So, they just f&#x27;get about thinking about\nor evaluating such work.  Again, the track record\nand promise of such research is from DoD, NSF, NIH,\netc., not IT entrepreneurs over the past 10-20 years.<p>Research based projects will likely remain\nonly a tiny fraction of what US IT VCs get in their\ninbox, but such projects are a good bet for a few\n$100+ exits over the next decade.  Considering\nhow few such successes there are,\nignoring\nsuch projects, especially with the example of\nDoD, is foolish.<p>For Cheriton, \nthey were not reading just some e-mail or investing\nin the technology; instead, they already knew\nthe professor and were investing in him.\nBut professors are not nearly the only people\nwho can do research.<p>> - Allow me to be clear. They are not ignoring e-mail.<p>No, flatly they are ignoring e-mail.  Write them\nsomething short, clear, and astounding, and they\njust ignore it, won&#x27;t read it, won&#x27;t respond at all.\nMaybe they want an introduction.  Maybe they want \nonly other means of selecting entrepreneurs.  Maybe\nthey just are having fun pissing off entrepreneurs.\nMaybe they are busy enough with what they are doing\nnow.  Maybe whatever, but they ignore e-mail.  Sorry &#x27;bout \nthat, but they do.<p>> - You seem to keep missing the obvious point of perhaps they evaluated the technology you seem to be so bunched up about...and didn&#x27;t care for it.<p>Nonsense.  For the technology in question, there is likely\nand apparently only one person in the world who knows it.\nSend A16Z a high level view, and they ignore the \ncommunications.  They make no attempt to get the\ndetails of the technology and evaluate it.  It&#x27;s \nsimple:  They just will not get involved in evaluating\nnew technology.<p>> - Perhaps they evaluated and weren&#x27;t impressed. Or is that impossible?<p>It is impossible.  They can&#x27;t have even as much\nas a weak little hollow hint of a tiny clue about\nanything about the crucial internals of the technology.\nThey received only a business view of the \npower and value of the technology.  For how it works,\nwhich is crucial for evaluating it, they don&#x27;t know.\nTo know they would have to do some due diligence.  There\nis little hope that they could competently direct the\ndue diligence.<p>> - Fantastic. Again we&#x27;re not talking about the broader VC industry.<p>Right.  We&#x27;re talking about A16Z.  My point was in\nresponse to your figure of 80%:  Likely a VC firm\nwith ROI just better than 80% of the VC industry is\nstill losing money for its LPs.  In this case,\neven if A16Z has better ROI than 80% of VC firms,\nthey might still be losing money.  However, since they just\nraised $1.5 billion, I suspect that it appears that\nthey are making money; since a lot of the old \ninvestments likely have yet to exit, it might be tough\nto know their ROI so far, but no doubt they had\nto show something good about ROI to raise $1.5 \nbillion.<p>> Incorrect. What about Oculus for example?<p>I don&#x27;t know that case well, but my superficial\nunderstanding is that the product was in production\nand selling and all a venture firm had to do\nwas to evaluate the sales figures and the\nproduct itself without much concern for any\ncrucial internals of the technology.  Like I said,\nthe US DoD, CIA, etc. funded the SR-71 when \nnearly it was was engineering on paper, and VCs\nwould want to wait until the plane was flying\nsuccessfully and then maybe pay for some of the\njet fuel.  US IT VCs just will not evaluate technical\nwork just on paper; they won&#x27;t do it.  Maybe\nthis situation is enforced by the LPs, but \nthat is the situation.  The story used to be\nthat VCs could fund a project described on the\nback of a napkin, but now they just will not\nfund original technical work just on paper or\neven when the corresponding software is production\nquality and running.  If some such project\ngets funded, then the reason was not just the\ntechnology and software but the reputation of the\nfounder or some such.  NSF, NIH, DARPA,\nPh.D. committees, and peer-reviewed journals\nof original research will evaluate new work\njust on paper, but US IT VCs just will not.\nAnd, e-mail with any such connection with\nsuch research goes into the bit bucket,\nfrom their &quot;filter&quot; if they look at the\ne-mail at all.<p>We are in agreement:  They just do not want to\nlook at e-mail.<p>So be it.<p>The project in question, if it starts to work at all,\nwill quickly generate revenue\nof $10,000, $40,000, ..., $800,000\na month starting with just a \n$1500 server and, for $1 million a month,\nusing just a few such servers in \na spare bedroom with some A/C in a window,\na consumer Internet connection (that permits\ncommercial usage), and a 200 A circuit breaker.<p>So, why jerk chains of VCs?  For the project in\nquestion, it has long been the case that\nthere has been no very good reason,\nalthough maybe just as &#x27;reserve fuel&#x27;\nin case of some disaster.  The main reason\nfor my posts here are just to let the HN\ncommunity know that A16Z and essentially\nall of US IT VC just will not take seriously\ndescriptions of technical work in e-mail\nwithout an introduction, knowing the\nperson, etc.  For anyone with a background\nin doing projects inside a business, for\nUS national security, or for academic\nresearch, this situation is just bizarre\nand has cost the founders of the project\na lot of time although only some time ago.\nBut the project moved forward on its own\nfunding, and revenue with good free cash\nflow, plenty enough to grow capacity\nif usage does grow, seems quite near.\nSo, for this project, to heck with VCs.\nBut the time wasted in the past on\nVCs still hurts.  And the HN audience\nshould know some of the truth.",1397285621

If a function is going to have to do something with every character of a string (e.g. copy it into a new buffer), <i>and</i> you don&#x27;t have very many registers reserved in your calling convention (especially true for e.g. system calls), then it&#x27;s silly to pass an explicit length if you know you&#x27;ve already NUL-terminated the string in its buffer.<p>All Unix system-call wrapper functions were specified this way, because it is guaranteed that they will need to move the string data from a user-space data structure to a kernel-space data structure (copying it wholesale in the process) before manipulating it. The NUL-terminated string can, in this case, be thought of as an <i>encoded wire format</i> for passing a string between the userland process and the kernel.<p>And <i>because</i> the Unix system-call wrappers--the most visible and useful parts of the C stdlib--followed this convention, C programmers generalized it into a convention for passing strings in general, even between functions in the same memory-space that can afford whatever registers they like.<p>If you&#x27;re <i>not</i> going to iterate over everything in the passed buffer, though, C intended you to do things more like sprintf: take a destination buffer, and explicit size; write to the destination buffer, <i>without</i> scanning for a NUL first as a place to begin, and <i>without</i> appending a NUL afterward; and return an explicit size in bytes written.",1397283040

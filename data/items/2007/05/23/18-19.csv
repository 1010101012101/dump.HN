They would see not only the number of people subscribed to their blog but also the priorities that they have assigned to it.<p>As a blogger, this might tell you that you should focus on quality rather than quantity for example.",1179946731

If you want to create a service that gives people their own presence on the web, this could make a difference.<p>Alternatively, maybe most users don't pay attention to URLs or look at the distinction above in the same way we developers do.<p>Also, the subdomain strategy seems to have worked well for Blogger.  They serve users' pages from *.blogspot.com, and their own pages from *.blogger.com.",1179944572

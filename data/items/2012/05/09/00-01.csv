3946606,comment,3945031,3946543,2,0,zbisch,,,"Ah, very good point.  The last thing I read on the Level3/Comcast spat story lead me to believe Comcast was paying Level3 for the peering. I apologize.  However, this line lead me to believe the author had a misunderstanding of the costs of traffic:<p>""...they almost certainly traverse fewer fiber route-miles and physical router ports (Comcasts two primary costs of delivery).""<p>That is, unless the author meant Comcast's primary costs within their network, which is not what I read it as. Without providing reference to the cost of the peering, the comparing the _geographic_ distance of traffic seemed irrelevant.  Even in this case, the reason that it is more expensive for Comcast to send traffic is not that is coming from Seattle, but because they are losing money on having Level3 pay them.<p>Edit: I also need to read more on this as I'm curious why Level3 is paying Comcast since Comcast is (as far as I know) not acting as a transit network. But I suppose this is what happens when you violate valley-free routing.<p>Edit2: Also, just wanted to add, the fact that Comcast controls the peering links is why this is so sketchy. By raising the costs of peering links, they could make it way more expensive for the competitors to send their users traffic, forcing the competitors to raise their prices, allowing Comcast to be the only content provider to have reasonable prices. While the part about the bandwidth to them not counting towards your cap is sketchy, the practice of charging you less, a lower flat rate, or not at all for traffic that stays within the network is reasonable. Where it is sketchy is when that difference is leveraged to make the service cheaper. If the service is more expensive, it's the fact they are charging competitors more that is sketchy.  So... in general, providing content and the network is all around sketchy.",1336525068

But this improvement will still be a big deal on such a machine.  This is because garbage collection and cycle collection cause pauses, and the length of the pauses are roughly proportional to the amount of live heap memory.  (Incremental garbage collection will soon be enabled, which will result in smaller garbage collection pauses, but there are no plans for incremental cycle collection and so cycle collection pauses will still be relevant.)

3946511,comment,3945146,3945146,2,0,6ren,,,"The problem is scaling and complexity: if you have 100 interacting entities, and add one more, it increases complexity by a factor of 100x.<p>The solution is to subdivide it into modules that can be treated as a single entity. The complexity within each module is much less because there are fewer entities within it, and there is less complexity between modules because there are fewer modules (which can be seen as entities at a higher level - and we can nest modules, to further reduce complexity).<p>The problem with <i>this</i> is that it is hard to find the right modules, that minimize interactions within them and between them. It takes a lot of data, a lot of insight and a lot of trial-and-error to find modularities that work well - it amounts to a theory of the data. In science, most theories take a long time to be discovered and a long time to be improved on - but we expect to do this routinely on each individual software project...<p>[ One way this is done in practice is when someone decides to tackle a generally needed problem, and wrap it up as a component (e.g. 3rd party library). To the extent that this is the <i>right</i> modularity, it will not only reduce the work a user needs to do to use it, but also reduce overall complexity in the total system (including for the component designer). ]<p>Instead of expecting it to be easy to find the right modularity, we should expect it to be hard; instead of insisting on a simple theory that explains everything, we should celebrate every small step towards better theories. This is what all practitioners facing empirical complexity in the real world end up doing.<p>> I feel like my answers are quite trivial since nobody really knows how to design a good language, including me.",1336523000

Running an application on such specialized application servers as Heroku provides has the benefit of being highly scalable, but it also means you have to adhere to some architectural patterns, which I believe address a lot of the migration issues people would normally encounter.<p>The most obvious example (and probably most relevant) is that on Heroku you <i>can't</i> store permanent files locally. Instead you need to store them on something like Amazon S3. However, the application servers also aren't a great place to do things like video processing. Instead, you'd lean on a third-party service like Zencoder.<p>As a result, applications that run well on Heroku have very few environmental dependancies and migration should be relatively straight forward. They even make it brilliantly easy to dump your database to a file that can be imported elsewhere.<p>I think the real pain in migrating from Heroku is outside of the application itself. I think the real pain is duplicating all the infrastructure and staffing you never had to think about when you deployed your app in the beginning. Honestly, I don't even know all the details of what they do. But I know I've never set it up myself and I'm not really interested in doing it. I don't want to hire someone to do it, either.

3946477,comment,3946008,3946339,6,0,zred,,,"So, I haven't read the entire agreement, but the ""release of unknown claims"" sounds to me like:<p>""You agree that if Bill Gates comes up to you tomorrow and offers you $1B, you can't get out of this.  You also agree that if you read a post on HN about our investors being crappy that you can't get out of it.  If those events/data were known to you at the time of signing this, you wouldn't sign this document.  However, you're saying that you accept the risk that you might find out some information that would have made you not sign this.""<p>In some ways, that makes sense.  When doing business dealings, you often don't have information that if you did have would alter your decisions.<p>I'm not a lawyer, but the difference between this release and a ""general release"" would be whether discovering information not known by you at the time of signing can let you out of the contract.  I remember my partner (who is in law school) talking about a contract where one party had withheld information that would have materially changed the second party's likelihood to sign the agreement.  I don't actually remember how the court ruled on it.<p>In this case, it's possible that the producers of the show might have sent around emails saying, ""this team's idea is pure crap, but we need to fill the time.""  Knowing that might change whether you want to sign up since, if the producers think it's crap, there's a greater possibility that the investors on the show will as well.  This also feels a bit on the deceptive side of things.  They're withholding their opinion of the team and by doing so it makes the team more likely to sign.<p>I wouldn't go on some VC reality show, but I think it's partly motivated by the fact that they must deal with lots of different people and some of those people might think it good to sue if they get jilted on the show.  As a counterpoint to a deceptive scenario, we could see a suit where the team alleged, ""If I had known that none of the investors were interested in X-Industry, I would never have come on the show.  They were from Y and Z-Industry and if I had known that, I wouldn't have given away 2% of my company.""  The retort could be, ""well, we can't have investors from every industry and often investors invest in things outside their core"".  In this scenario, ABC was trying to do good - introduce a team they liked to investors who might branch out into their industry.  The ABC team might have believed in good faith that the team was awesome and would persuade the investors.  However, the knowledge that the investors were from a different industry might change the team's decision on the contract.  Nothing was withheld in a deceptive manner, but it was still data that might have changed the team's decision.<p>In terms of being able to waive rights, some you can and some you can't.  For example, in my state, if you have your own private entry/egress, you can waive your right to have the landlord do snow removal.  At the same time, there are many things that renter's can't waive their rights on.  Sometimes laws are written as a default.  It's important that we've decided a way that this is handled in the absence of some explicit agreement to the contrary.  However, other times we genuinely want to establish a floor past which one cannot go.  I don't really know a lot about California law.<p>Again, I wouldn't go on some VC reality show and maybe I'm reading this wrong, but it doesn't sound too outrageous unless I'm missing something.  I'm with you - I like dealing with low-key people with sound dealings.  However, I don't think people like us are the types that the title conjures up.  ""Shark Tank"" sounds like it's for people looking to make a big bang and get their way - possibly even if it means lawyering up and going after ABC.  I'm not trying to defend ABC - I wouldn't agree to be on this show - but this might be reasonable if it's just about making sure that they don't have to worry about people saying, ""but I never knew X and if I had known X I wouldn't have signed this"" where X is something that wasn't withheld in an intent to deceive, but rather one of the millions of variables that change our decisions.  Or maybe ABC is trying to be able to be deceptive and covering themself.  I guess I haven't watched the show so I'm not sure what the environment is like.<p>EDIT: A concrete example (based on on Wikipedia).  Right now, Mark Cuban is listed on the show.  You want to be on the show because you think Mark Cuban specifically would like your idea.  ABC is in contract negotiations with Cuban for the next season.  He might not be on the show.  Then we get into a big thing of going through emails.  Emails show that Cuban was threatening to leave.  They didn't tell you that.  They reply that it's just part of his hard-ball approach to get the best contract and that they didn't think it was actually going to happen.  Seems like a nightmare.",1336522408

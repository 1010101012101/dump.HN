3939841,comment,3939184,3939790,6,0,tptacek,,,"CISPA doesn't add any regulation to network traffic. It doesn't impose government controls. It's an opt-in mechanism that purports to allow private companies to share information incident to security attacks on their services; what it does, essentially, is clarify the (already very weak) privacy controls of the ECPA to make it clear that companies who are being attacked can share traffic captures without being sued the way Google is now for the Street View fiasco. It doesn't authorize countermeasures; it doesn't enable services to be shut off; it doesn't alter due process controls for the government to seize information from non-cooperative services.<p>With that in mind, I'm curious as to how your reasoning might change. Do you think an opt-in information sharing mechanism for corporations really validates the state-sponsored network access control used in Iran and China? I'm interested in how.<p> <i>They already probably can't be sued for that, but I believe the thinking here is that by spelling it out in black-letter law, companies will be encouraged to share information more than they already do; note that ISPs already do have programs to share attack information among themselves, but application service providers tend not to.</i>",1336409998

But we have seen from experience, that people that have trouble finding something to undertake are better off working on other people's ideas. If they have what it takes to be an entrepreneur, they will find their idea while working on another.<p>This is why people working for Google, Facebook, and startups become really great entrepreneurs. They live the life, they learn the trade and then when they get an idea they have everything in the world to succeed.<p>But in turn, if you just came out of college, being an Entrepreneur sounds good, let's try it without any clue on what you are doing, then it is going to be a waste of your time.<p>But I have to agree.

There's far more to consider when selecting a programming language beyond ""Does Language X have a superset of the features of Language Y?"".<p>Plus, sometimes having fewer features is <i>itself</i> a feature. I would say that this is especially true when comparing the slim, minimal design of C with the ""everything <i>and</i> the kitchen sink"" approach of C++. Not that C++ is never useful in its own right, but that doesn't mean its appropriateness for a given task is always greater than or equal to that of C.",1336409823

Why this guy didnt tried to tap the contacts button while on an emergency call, and why he didnt try to launch the multitasking by double tapping the home button. I have tried both methods and it worked!<p>Double tapping the home button while on a Emergency call screen showed all the previously used apps, you could easily switch between them but not go to the home screen; so I tried the other method. Call the iPhone from your other phone if you know the number, answer it, tap the contacts button and now hit the home button; thats it! Youre on a home screen with full control over device.

3939820,comment,3936310,3936701,12,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I certainly think the frequent flyer miles thing was a mistake on the part of American Airlines (AA). But one of the things that bugs me about the article is that the 'marginal' cost of flying these folks is the same as the marginal cost of flying someone in coach, or flying someone in general. Weight * cost of gas to carry that weight + consumables such as food, tissues, Etc.<p>So when AA argues they 'lose millions' they are really saying that if they could sell this persons First Class seat to someone else on short notice they would make more money. But that assumption glosses over the fact that folks fly First with mileage upgrades, or get 'bumped' from coach on an over sale situation, or book way in advance and pay less. Since there isn't any discussion about what the average seat price is for First Class on the same flight when no AirPass member is flying, it didn't feel like they were being particularly objective with regard to price.<p>The fact that they could not sell AirPass + Companion for $3M (which according to them would have the owner 'ruining' AA in year 2 at this rate) seems to me to validate my feeling that they are over pricing their 'loss' here.",1336409672

3939790,comment,3939184,3939724,4,0,chernevik,,,"Honestly I'm not a CISPA expert.  I do see two concerns:<p>1.  It seems to me that inviting government examination and regulation of network traffic, in the name of security, seems unlikely to make the 'net _more_ flexible, and potentially could lead real rigidity that would be bad for development of 'net businesses and degrading the experience possible over the 'nets.<p>2.  Stuff like CISPA is generally validating of 'net control regimes such as in Iran and China.  As the malice of those becomes ever more apparent, US policies viewed as precedents and justifications will be suspect, as will supporters of those policies.  Supporting this stuff will be like supporting tobacco companies and netting dolphins to catch tuna -- and may cause deep customer suspicion in a field where trust will be crucial.<p>Now item item 1, more rigidity, could be seen as positive for incumbents like FB.  To which I'd would say that technology has already evolved around a lot of rigidity and that any business founded on a particular regulatory environment is dated to the moment when technology obviates those regulations.<p>Item 2 is more speculative, but I actually think more likely to prove telling.  But it's going to take 5 - 10 years.<p>Someone more knowledable of CISPA could do better.  The broader point of my remark is, figure out how those details relate to the Facebook business model and speak to that.  Do that and you'll have an audience.

Once you let C++ features creep in you can inadvertently end up with runtime static initializers, type_info symbols, exception unwinding code and debugging symbols, etc.<p>My current compromise is to compile as C99 everywhere except on MSVC, where I will compile as C++ and use C++ alternatives to features like designated initializers.",1336408729

3939675,comment,3938566,3939326,2,0,spacemanaki,,,"> So whenever I post on OOADP, seems like everybody gets in a bit of a snit with me :) (not you, just a small minority of the community. Perhaps these are dangerous political waters!) But I'll explain a bit more. Please remember, though, that this is long-format material.<p>I appreciate it, and I recognize that there's sometimes a bit of knee-jerk snittiness that can come across in these OOP vs FP debates, including in my post. If you've written about this in a longer format somewhere else, or plan to, I would be interested.<p>> FP makes little blocks and then fits them together into bigger units. In OOP you might spend a lot of time on structure without ever writing any code that does anything at all.<p>This is getting closer to the crux of things. The bottom-up FP style just fits my own workflow and habits better. Spending a lot of time building structure without writing code that does anything seems like dangerous premature design. Thinking about the problem and about problem solving ahead of time is important, but I'm not sure that building structure is.<p>> In FP I always feel like I'm carrying the linker around in my head. :)<p>I'm not really sure what you mean.<p>> OOP, to me at least, is much more about the people part of programming than it is the technical part. FP guys are always making these technical arguments about their language, and they miss the point entirely: the problem that OOADP solves isn't a technical one, it's an organizational one. Where does stuff go?<p>I think it's possible to answer this question in a functional program, as another commenter said, Clojure namespaces provide an answer to questions like ""where"". I think bigger picture design like MVC can be useful here, see ClojureScript One for one (relatively simplistic, but very interesting nonetheless) example.<p>So I guess if OOP/OOADP is about solving a nontechnical problem, my question would be if we can solve those same social problems while writing FP code? If we want to avoid object oriented hierarchies and graphs that are interconnected and <i>complected</i>, can we still address the social and nontechnical problems you think OO solves? Surely that's possible? It seems that relying on OO to solve these problems drags in an awful lot of baggage (like introducing a lot of  mutable state that is problematic for very technical reasons).<p>Thanks for the pointers to those books, I'll check them out.",1336408084

The rumor mill usually kicks into high gear around the time all of the retail and online stores start running low on stock. In fact, with Macs, they typically <i>do</i> just upgrade the hardware and keep the price point the same on the newer models. I'm not saying that it's impossible that Apple would release an $800 MB Air, just that it would be atypical for them, and it seems unlikely. Maybe if this story offered some actual evidence for why Apple would drop it's prices, but it didn't. All it says is ""Somebody somewhere said so"", and continues on to actually weaken it's point by saying that everybody else in the ""ultrabook"" segment is cutting back production, presumably because they aren't selling well vs. the MB Air.",1336407705

Additionally, in tech, storage and ram of a given size typically gets cheaper year after year. SSDs have dropped precipitously from about $2 a GB wholesale to about $0.78 or less a GB wholesale.<p>So while they may only have had $50-100 profit on the newest 1k MBA on release day, they probably have 2-3 times that by now on the line. They can still sell it profitably (most likely) at this point as they get no more fixed costs with regards to the product.<p>Now you say 'Why not keep selling at 1k?'. The reason that doesn't work is because they're releasing a new line. So this older design (current 1k MBA) is just going to be obsoleted if they don't make a 800 MBA. They'll go back to the same initial high upfront cost 1k MBA.<p>Sure, some of the 800 MBA sales will be cannibalization of the 1k MBA sales they'd make this year. However, as I mentioned before, electronics have a very high start up cost for a new line, per item profit will actually be pretty similar between the new line and last years line, but they'll sell more total units, making higher profit.",1336407099

Social Security provides a fixed rate of return, and provides benefits throughout old age, regardless of how long one lives. How? Not through investment, through fiat. And ultimately that's the core of the problem, because the only way to achieve that is to have more workers paying in to the system than there are retirees pulling from it. Whether it's dollars or government bonds sitting around in a vault somewhere the problem of making them multiply by fiat will always exist. And that's the problem that Social Security ultimately faces.

3939539,comment,3936320,3939385,2,0,Symmetry,,,"Its certainly possible that the universe will end in a crunch or a rip, and all this speculation will be for naught.  But thermodynaics is still a perfectly valid way of looking at these things, and hasn't been changed much by the addition of quantum mechanics except that we now talk about probability distributions within phase space instead of points.  Its basically the same stuff, with the same consequences.<p>Entropy is much more than just dS = dQ/T.  I mean, that equation is mostly valid the same way that Newton's laws are mostly valid, but you won't be able to get any sort of feel for it approaching the subject that way.  Imagine a mathmatical space with six dimensions for every particle, three for position and three for momentum.  The state of the universe is a single point moving in this space according to pre-defined rules.  Now, we don't know which point or microstate corresponds to our universe, because we can only make crude measurements of statistical aggregates of particles like temperature and pressure and so forth.  So by  making these measurements we can narrow which universe we're in to a set of these microstates, a 6N-k dimensional region of the 6N dimensional space that we'll call a macrostate.  The entropy of an observed macrostate is proportional to the log of the number of microstates that a macrostate contains, S = k log W.  In a sense, Entropy is a measure of our ignorance of which universe we're in, which is ultimately why Maxwell's demon doesn't work.<p>Please note, the above does contain simplifying assumptions which don't change the main point.  For the full story, go get a physics minor at a good university or start reading Wikipedia[1] and asking your physics major friends questions until you can re-derive the laws of thermodynamics yourself.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_thermodynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_thermodynamics</a>",1336406537

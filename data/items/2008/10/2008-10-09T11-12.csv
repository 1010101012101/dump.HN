327717,comment,327096,327096,0,0,mseebach,,,"I bike most places. There's good access and good parking at my university, so on bad weather days, or when I'm late, I take the car.
My problem is sweat, as much as rain. After biking for 25 minutes I absolutely need to change my shirt. This is fine for everyday use, since a sweater or polo fold nicely in a backpack, but for business meetings (I'm halftime student, halftime PM), I need a suit-coat and a shirt, and they'll wrinkle way too much in a backpack.

My now-supervisor grilled me with Javascript and SQL questions.  They were easy at first, and became increasingly more difficult, to the point that I just had to ""I don't know"" to a few of them.  The questions required a bit of problem solving (so it wasn't all technical details), so the process was just as important as the answer, but in the end, it gave the interviewer a detailed view into my level of competency with the technologies I would use daily.<p>It should be noted that I thought I bombed the interview, but a few weeks later I had an offer in hand.  When I got the call, I had a mind to ask him if he had the right person.  :-)",1223552028

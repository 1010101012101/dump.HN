1094673,comment,1094575,1094654,0,0,cperciva,,,"I think Amazon originally intended Reserved instances as a way to give customers lower pricing in exchange for accepting some of the capacity planning risk; but that has more or less been subverted by the use of Reserved instances as a disaster recovery strategy, where lower pricing isn't a major goal.  It would be nice if Amazon could find a pricing mechanism which separated these two groups.",1265107446

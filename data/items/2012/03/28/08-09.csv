3765322,comment,3764403,3764949,11,0,moilolita,,,"In order to understand why romanians take this so seriously, you need to understand the context. Romania is widely regarded by the western Europe as backward, poor and corrupt. On top of this, Romania has the largest Roma minority in the region ~500.000 according to wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_(Romani_subgroup). The average westerner can't distinguish a romanian from a roma/romani/gipsy although they are quite distinct. In the last 20 years there were several waves of romanian immigrants hitting the western europe, including the Roma minority which are highly nomadic by tradition and very visible in the west because they beg and steal aggressively and live in slums in very primitive conditions. This lead to the association romanians = gipsies, thiefs, primitives etc. The current campaign is a response to these stereotypes, which unfortunately are easily promoted in western europe especially since western massmedia can't pick on blacks and arabs anymore cause that's clearly racist and open racism is not trendy anymore.",1332924989

I find it a bit hard to imagine that html can do the same job. The minor (or major) inconsistencies between html engines can lead to so many different renderings from the same source and I don't think that you want that for your texts. I agree though that typography in browsers has come a long way since the early 00s and is definitely in good track. The tools you are mentioning are nice but setting them up does not seem to be any less complicated than TeX and friends (not mentioning the fact that the hyphenated result [1] from Hyphenator looks so bad; it begs for margin protrusion, but that's a different issue)<p>In my opinion LuaTeX (and its LaTeX counterpart) is the future of TeX.

MS was universally loathed when they were <i>forcing</i> people to use their browser and when it wasn't possible to do any meaningful consumer computing without paying the Windows tax.  Now that we don't <i>have</i> to use MS software, MS are having to make software that people might actually use by choice.  It's very hard for a dominant company to avoid becoming evil (cf. Google), but the flip-side is that once the dominance fades away the company has to start competing on merit again.<p>Second, MS in 1997 were competing with Netscape (cool startup), Sun (hippies) and IBM (erm...).  Now they're competing, and often successfully, with Facebook (evil), Apple (enormous) and Google (evil and enormous).  Today's 20-year-old college student was <i>six years old</i> during the ""browser wars"" anti-trust trial and isn't going to hold grudges for it.  Today's Microsoft is sort of like late 90s IBM - dull, slightly confused and often irrelevant, but it's not exactly <i>evil</i>; XBox/Kinect is a genuinely good product, and Windows Phone is actually <i>innovative</i> rather than an iPhone clone; Bill Gates has morphed from a dystopian monopolist plutocrat into your genial wealthy uncle who spends his time trying to cure malaria and tackle poverty, more famous for giving his money away than for the means by which he amassed it.<p>None of this means that Microsoft is now the hippest tech company around, but it does explain how they might become so and why that wouldn't be a bad thing.",1332923420

But I agree the system is ridiculous and arbitrary (20 years in the IT is probably 100 years in some other fields :)).<p>I think the best way to deal with patents is to make a 4 year patent free period, in which you can file for new patents, but you can't sue anyone for infringement, and any work within those 4 years can't be affected by existing patents after the period expires. AFAIK this was already done by the US government in the aviation because they didn't want to pay Wright brothers, and the aviation industry grew, but I read this a long time I don't remember the details. But essentially you can measure the R&D investments in the industry and provide a empirical argument on how much R&D investment was lost (if any, I think the effect would be opposite, but it's a speculation) and compare with how much the industry has grown, then if you come to conclusion that patents are necessary measure the average R&D investment cost, profit, return periods, and compile that data in to a optimal time period which would allow the average successful/profitable patent to recoup the investment and earn a premium on standard rate of return.",1332922499

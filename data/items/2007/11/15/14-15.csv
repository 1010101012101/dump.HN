You can make the world a better place if you:\n - Make it easier for people to do things they have to do so they can go home early and spend more time reading to their \nsmall children or whatever else they like.\n - Make information more available and clear so people can understand better how things work and what's really going on, particularly with things that affect them directly\n",1195138790

80198,comment,79982,80107,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Almost all startups are lame when they're first created.  Most people wait until they're somewhat less lame before releasing them, but Aaron seems to like doing everything in public.  At least he's putting things out there, which is more than can be said for most people on this board (myself included).<p>I just wish he'd grow some balls and actually finish a project instead of giving up and moving on to the next thing.  Successful startups that start out sucky keep on improving even though everyone says they suck.  Aaron seems to move on to the next great idea in hopes that it'll suck less, and it inevitably doesn't.",1195138359

It's lightness and simplicity is really attractive.<p>One thing that bothers me in a lot of frameworks is the object wrapping of the database.  I can't see much justification for this, it just seems to be adding a layer of complexity on top of a very clearly designed model.   How much easier is it to use an object abstraction when you could just do SQL directly?<p>John.\n",1195137826

80188,comment,80178,80178,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I started with a very light framework (web.py) and then switched to Pylons.<p>I'd say it's mostly based on personal preference.  If you don't use a framework, you <i>will</i> end up reinventing a lot of stuff that's in mainstream frameworks.  OTOH, the stuff you spend reinventing really won't take you much longer than learning the framework, as long as you build off a decent set of libraries (<i>don't</i> try to reinvent your own templating-library/HTML-escaping/database-interface etc.)  And if you do switch to a framework, you'll probably be better able to understand the reasoning behind why the framework did what it did.<p>One other consideration: frameworks make it much easier for somebody new to get up-to-speed with your code, and often tackle thorny deployment issues that you can spend a lot of time on otherwise.  Keep that in mind when deciding - for a startup, the priority is to get something up on screen so you can see if you're on the right track, but you do eventually want to be able to grow and scale.",1195137483

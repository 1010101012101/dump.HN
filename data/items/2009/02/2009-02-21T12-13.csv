We understand that some think it is a bit scary letting people test any site they want, but the fact is that <i>anyone</i> with a DSL connection at home can choose any site they want out there and put a lot more load on it using their home PC, than we allow anonymous users to do with our service.<p>We want the service to be really user-friendly and easy to get started with, and think we have reached a fairly good level of compromise where security is ""good enough"" without sacrificing usability.<p>What we could, and should do, however, is be more informative about all the security measures we have taken to prevent abuse. Because we have put a <i>lot</i> of man-hours into that lately, and we will continue to build more, hopefully non-intrusive, security measures all the time to try and make the service unattractive to would-be abusers.",1235220892

Yep .. fair and square, game's up boys.""<p>Ha! There is only one response Last.fm can give, and that is to deny. If they didn't do it, that's the truth. If they did, people knowing will cause massive damage to their business, so they deny. Later the CEO can blame it on a rogue employee if necessary, or whatever.<p>Of course they'd lie. I'm not saying they <i>are</i> lying, but if they're guilty, they'd be crazy not to. Lying is not illegal and, if it turns out the data sharing story is true, it will seem like nothing compared to that black mark.<p>Last.fm are not a lovable plucky young upstart anymore. They're owned by CBS. They will do whatever CBS lawyers tell them to. The story is plausible but unproven, and the denial entirely predictable and meaningless. Hopefully the truth will come out soon. I think a lot of people are very interested in what that turns out to be.",1235220785
489805,comment,489450,489516,0,0,sounddust,,,"I think they need to fire Erick Schonfeld.  When he wrote an article about last.fm layoffs on TC, he published a screenshot of the private status updates of last.fm employees, which - although he had the legal right to do so, was a pretty pathetic move which went against journalistic standards.  He refused to upload a new screenshot which blurred out the pictures and names of the employees (which would have had the same effect without needlessly invading others' privacy).<p>Now he has published a full article, complete with a picture merging the RIAA and last.fm's logos, based on an unsubstantiated rumor which last.fm apparently denied before the story was published.<p>He seems to have something against last.fm. It makes me wonder if Schonfeld has a stake in one of their competitors, or if he is simply an incompetent journalist.<p>One thing that really angers me about TechCrunch in general is that they almost never retract articles, post new retractions, or change the text to reflect the truth.  I could understand if TC was a print publication, but come on, they have an edit button.  They can change the article text in 5 minutes.<p>The NYT, for example, not only edits the text of the article, but leaves a note a the bottom explaining what the incorrect text said and how they changed it.  This means that the old readers can see the notes upon re-reading, and the new readers will not be mislead (and will still know it's been changed so that they can update people who read the old version)<p>What TC does instead is keep the misleading title intact, the misleading first 5 or 6 paragraphs intact, and then publish a small note at the very bottom of the article.  Guess what?  Most people only read the headlines, and most of the rest only read the first few paragraphs.  It's so wrong.  I hope last.fm gets a full retraction for this crap.",1235220656

It's just not enough to either make you succeed or make you fail.<p>You can't argue with the fact that some people are naturally talented at certain things. Whether that comes through practice or genetics depends on which things you're talking about (I'd say that being a talented sportsman takes genetics as well as huge amounts of practice, and being tone-deaf precludes you from becoming a talented composer no matter how much you practice), but both are factors.<p>Talent without practice is nothing. Practice without talent is more than nothing. But that doesn't negate the existence of talent.",1235220655

489802,comment,489450,489537,0,0,sho,,,"So, you oppose all negative reporting that could potentially ""cause harm to a site [you] enjoy""? I presume your attitude would change if they proved to be true? Well how are we going to know unless the story comes out and is investigated?<p>If last.fm gave the RIAA that information, they are toast. I think a very great number of people are interested in the truth coming out. Stock denials are utterly routine and mean nothing.<p><i>""Give a digg to the counter story""</i><p>Does ""digging"" things increase their truthiness, or something? Does the side of the story that gets more ""diggs"" get declared the winner?<p>God, strange world some people live in.",1235220396

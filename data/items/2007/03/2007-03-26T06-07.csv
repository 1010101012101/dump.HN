Canada is the premier public fundraising country in the world, I believe.

I failed to make a distinction-- I am not opposed to funding, but think that VC funding is overrated.    <p>If you are seeing your business as a 1-3 year affair- if you believe that in that time period you'll either crash or get bought or go big, and you don't have any resources... then taking VC funding to cover basics like food, housing, bandwidth, maybe makes sense.  I would still say that angel funding is better.   And if you're just out of college then its kind of a no-lose situation.  You get funded, then you've won because you have a job until the funding runs out and even if you crash and burn, you'll still be well set up to do another startup. <p>But if you want to build something that lasts... you have to take into account all the costs of various types of funding.  This I may not have illuminated as well.  <p>After so many months, the VC funds turn into, effectively, a high interest rate loan with a lein against your business.  If you go to sell, you may find that they get the entire proceeds. Sometimes they even put a 2-3x liquidation preference there... so even a success results in nothing to the founders.  <p>The essense of these terms is that the clock is ticking, and you are put in a position where you have to hit a home run, or die trying.  And the VC firm will guide you in this direction, and replace you if you do not make the choices that lead that way.  They are only interested in home runs, not viable businesses. <p>This is also why acquisition is more popular now- the risk reward profile has changed, or at least people learned form the 1990s bubble.

6283,comment,6244,6244,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Email verification? Email verification is no filter!
If you use an activation email, there really isn't a need for a captcha. Captchas are useful because users don't need to leave the current website, check their email, activate it, and come back -- they would have lost their thought inertia at that point, assuming they arrived at the verification step because they wanted to do something useful with whatever application.
If I am missing the point, do explain; I fail to see something to consider to add from that picture. That captcha is also terribly breakable.",1174890274
6282,comment,6228,6265,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Are you sure about that?  We're on a network, and I suspect most of us are building networking tools.  Networking is a lot easier now. <p>Plus, I think networking is a skill, not a service. <p>And think about the cost- not just the equity, but the strings. It would be cheaper to pay a highly networked individual a fee for making introductions than getting VC funding.  <p>I understand the perspective of someone who has no entre into what seems like a closed community.  But having had to learn the skill of networking (and still not being great at it) I've found that anyone who you should partner with, sell to, or do business with, is open to at least hearing enough to understand what your value is.  Once I realized this, I started talking to CEOs of companies that I would meet at various places - conferences, on planes, cold calling, etc.  A few have not understood, some were a bit put off, but this is the reaction maybe %5 of the time.  Everyone else has at least thought about what I've said, and even when they've said ""no"", a good number of times they've given me a name of someone I should be talking to instead.<p>I think by itself, this isn't a good reason to pursue VC funding.  Advice and introductions are much less expensive elsewhere. ",1174890234

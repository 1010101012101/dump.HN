CMake is also good, it can generate native makefiles or project files for your build tools, including Unix Makefiles and Microsoft Visual Studio project files.<p>I usually use vim, SCons, and GDB for most of my stuff. If you need a graphical debugger, try DDD. If you like IDEs, might want to try Eclipse and KDevelop. I usually use online docs in HTML format, including man pages. (So to look up how stat(2) works, I google for ""stat 2 man page"".)<p>Another indispensable tool in general is GNU Screen.",1203673745

121175,story,,,75,42,qwestion,"Ask News.YC: How to re-motivate yourself?",,"I have always wondered what the drivers were behind motivation. I am sure all of us have experienced setbacks and we have had to re-motivate ourselves every now and then.<p>We have been working on a startup idea for almost an year now. The initial days were fantastic, we were totally convinced we had hit upon a brilliant idea, there was vacuum to be filled. We worked crazy hours, got a lot of stuff done. Needless to say we were highly motivated.<p>But lately, I am personally having trouble motivating myself. I see myself squandering valuable time that I could have utilized. We suddenly seem to have a few competitors and it suddenly appear as though we don't have a unique value proposition.<p>And I have been pondering over this for some time now. I do realize that the lack of motivation is a  sign that things have to be done differently, or something needs to change. We either need to course-correct, change gears, think of a different market, a different approach or just look into ourselves honestly and understand ourselves better.<p>I was hoping to find some answers to my misgivings through this forum. I have benefited from news.yc in the past and I have no doubt that you guys will help us bounce back.<p>So here are my questions to sum things up:<p>1. What do you do when things are not going the way you want them to?<p>2. When do you know its time to change? (eg: market, process, partners.. etc)<p>3. When do you know its time to call it quits? (to start working on a different problem)<p>I would really be thankful if some of you could share your experiences so that all of us benefit.<p>Thanks!!!",1203673511

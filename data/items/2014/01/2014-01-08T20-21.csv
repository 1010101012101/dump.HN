Should homelessness and poverty be the main concerns for politicians?  Why do you believe our system has failed to the point of &quot;elect random people from the public.&quot;<p>>Why can&#x27;t we change things, shake things up a bit, push the envelope?<p>&quot;Push the envelope&quot; is a meaningless expression.

7026582,comment,7024626,7026436,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> There are lots of communities around GPL licensed software as well, so that&#x27;s kinda a moot point, no?<p>No, the point wasn&#x27;t &quot;only permissively licensed software can have communities&quot; (which would be ridiculous), it was &quot;the fact that many organizations are less receptive to the GPL can result in larger potential contributing communities for permissively-licensed projects&quot;.<p>> GPL software is guaranteed to stay free.<p>GPL software is no more guaranteed to stay free than permissively licensed software is.<p>The closest thing to that that is a real difference between GPL and permissively-licensed software is that, assuming no radical change on the part of the FSF (or, alternatively, assuming the &quot;or any later version&quot; option isn&#x27;t used), GPL software is guarantted to not have legal non-free derivative works not separately licensed by the copyright owner.

7026574,comment,7025499,7025673,2,0,vivekl,,,"I am an SDE with Amazon having worked across AWS and the retail side. I have done over a hundred interviews in the past 2 years for SDE loops. Each of these involved a debrief led by bar raisers. I have yet to experience a &quot;veto&quot; by a bar raiser as outlined in this article. As far as I have experienced, the bar raisers&#x27; questions are not typically any more complicated or harsher than other interviewers. The main role of the bar raiser is in fact during the debrief, i.e. after the interviewee has completed the interviews.<p>At Amazon candidates are evaluated on an array of competencies. In addition to technical competencies, particular attention is paid to Amazon&#x27;s leadership principles (the fact that these are displayed right at the careers page: <a href""http://www.amazon.com/b?node=23936501"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/b?node=239365011</a> should highlight how important these are in the culture). I love that culture-fit and leadership qualities play as big a part as technical abilities in Amazon&#x27;s decision making process unlike what I have seen in some of the other companies people mention in the same breath as Amazon. In my experience a good bar raiser acts as an unbiased advocate for the greater good of the company. As a result, they are NOT from the same team with the open position (this doesn&#x27;t mean that an accountant is judging an engineering candidate or vice-versa mind you, they just happen to be from a different org) which allows them to look-past the immediate need the team might have which could blind them to some of the obvious flaws in the candidate. In some ways they are also acting on behalf of the candidate by ensuring the match works both ways. I have seen several situations where the bar raiser determined that the &quot;team&quot; or the &quot;role&quot; were poorer fit for the candidate than the other way around and went out of their way to facilitate a correction.<p>That said, there is no question that good bar raisers are just as, if not harder to come by than good employees! It is a thankless, demanding assignment to take. I have met some absolutely amazing bar raisers and some others that are just darn right atrocious. Considering how quickly Amazon is growing, they definitely need more of them but that risks damage through poorer ones entering the system.",1389214719

7026569,comment,7023299,7023299,2,0,mindcrime,,,"I recently read an absolutely fascinating book called <i>The Origin of Wealth</i>.[1]  Nominally the topic is economics, but it&#x27;s far broader than that, talking about how all components of the economic system of wealth creation (including &quot;firms&quot;) are part of a Complex Adaptive System, and are often CAS&#x27;s themselves.  The author makes the argument that a firm is a CAS using evolution to explore a &quot;fitness landscape&quot; in terms of it&#x27;s &quot;Business Plan&quot; (his term that encompasses strategy at various levels within the firm).  IF you buy this theory, it has some very interesting implications in terms of how firms should be managed, and the author provides some interesting thoughts.<p>One point that stood out to me, is that all firms face a constant, internal tension between the need to do &quot;operational stuff&quot; that actually works very well with a traditional hierarchical management approach, and the need to do &quot;exploratory work&quot; which does NOT map well to hierarchy.  Failing to understand and manage this tension may be why many firms feel so dysfunctional.<p>The other point that stood out to me, is the idea that instead of a strict hierarchy - or complete undirected chaos - the best way to combine efforts towards both goals is by having individuals with <i>a high degree of autonomy and empowerment</i> coupled with a <i>strong shared vision and common goals</i>.<p>In this model, the primary purpose of leadership is to imbue the members of the organization with that &quot;strong shared vision and common goals&quot;.   Or to put it more simply, you tell people what needs to be accomplished, not how to accomplish it, and trust them to use their judgment.<p>On a related note, the book <i>Adaptive Enterprise</i>[2] makes a strong case for the idea of high decentralized teams, connected to each other through what the author calls a &quot;Commitment Management Protocol&quot;.[3]<p>I would say that both of these books have some useful ideas that could be applied to construct a better management structure than what most present-day firms use.<p>[1]: <a href""http://www.amazon.com/The-Origin-Wealth-Remaking-Economics/dp/142212103"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Origin-Wealth-Remaking-Economics/d...</a><p>[2]: <a href""http://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Enterprise-Creating-Sense-And-Respond-Organizations/dp/087584874"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Enterprise-Creating-Sense-And...</a><p>[3]: <a href""http://coevolving.com/blogs/index.php/archive/conversations-for-action-commitment-management-protocol"" rel""nofollo"">http://coevolving.com/blogs/index.php/archive/conversations-...</a>",1389214691

7026563,comment,7024626,7026393,6,0,cjbprime,,,"The difference can be broadly characterized as individual vs. societal freedom.  To resolve your problem with the meaning of &quot;free&quot;, you have to think about who the intended recipients of the freedom are.<p>If there are no restrictions against (to pick a colorful example) letting your dog go to the toilet on the sidewalk, then individually you have more &quot;freedom to do whatever I want&quot;, but societies work better when you can walk around without constantly stepping in dog poop.<p>So, the way I look at it is that the GPL attempts to build a society where total happiness is greater than in the society that gave more permissions to everyone.  If you agree with the existence of laws that prevent poor behaviors, you&#x27;re already sympathetic to this view in principle; it just becomes a practical question of whether the harms that the GPL is trying to avoid are serious enough for it to make it worth the trade-off with individual liberty.  Reasonable people disagree about this.",1389214681
7026562,comment,7023650,7023650,3,0,habosa,,,"I love Haskell and Java.  From a high level they are my favorite languages for their respective paradigms, so I think most programmers should at least try to write a simple program in both.<p>That said, I think people are overreacting to Java as a CS 100-level language because of enterprise experiences.<p>I have written enterprise Java and I hate it, but I still love Java.  Java EE is all beans and POJOs and XML and Swing and cruft and I want to burn it in a fire.  But that&#x27;s not Java, those are libraries.<p>Java is an excellent language to introduce someone to programming, because there is very little magic.  Everything is explicit, due to the static typing and imperative nature.  The computer (or JVM in this case) doesn&#x27;t do anything that you don&#x27;t tell it to do.  That&#x27;s easy for someone to grasp.<p>Additionally, Java makes it very easy to write readable, organized, and extensible programs even if they are verbose.   Using classes, objects, methods, types, and all of that OOP stuff makes it easy to write modular programs where each piece of code does exactly one thing.  In functional programming the intricacies of passing state and higher-level functions lead to a lot more spaghetti code for someone who has never programmed before.<p>Do I think that we should only teach Java?  No, of course not.  Do I think that it&#x27;s still a great first language?  Absolutely.<p>If I had control of a curriculum, I&#x27;d teach Java for half a semester and then Haskell for half of the semester.  I think it&#x27;s important to not introduce &quot;more productive&quot; dynamic languages like Ruby or Python until students have had to deal with concepts like types so that they can appreciate what Python and other dynamic languages are leaving out.<p>At Penn, where I go to school, the intro to CS class teaches OCaml in the first half and Java in the second.  Unfortunately I think that so many people are struggling with writing code as a concept that they&#x27;re too frustrated to appreciate the beauty of OCaml at first.  Teaching it after something a little easier would make the advantages clearer.",1389214672

When assessing risks of this size, I am glad that JPM seemed to be asking all the right questions about Madoff (which no one else, not even the SEC, was asking), it is funny JPM is being penalized for this.<p>Creating a similar idiosyncratic risk could be to sell a gold ETF and own physical gold, paying maybe 30 bps a year for a real outperformance during a) hyperinflation if real gold is needed or b) some gold bars at the ETF turn out to be fake/not there (some have been found to be tungsten) c) another unforseen event.

They own probably 90% of the claims now, &#x27;vicitms&quot; selling at roughly 20 cents on the dollar.  Anyone really pointing the finger at JPM is very naive about the whole system.",1389213953

The reason isn&#x27;t language schism (that too, but I&#x27;d attach a much smaller weight to it) so much as the schism between corporatism & academia.<p>Corporate America wants languages that are dumb, easy for corporate drones to assimilate, hard to mess up with, verbose ( verbosity is misinterpreted as documentation in the enterprise) and Java fits the bill from the get-go.<p>Now, that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t do non-dumb things in Java - at Sun Microsystems, we worked on all sorts of very cool R&D-type shit like JavaOS(<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaO"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaOS</a>), Hotjava ( <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotJav"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotJava</a>), JavaSpaces (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaSpaces#JavaSpace"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaSpaces#JavaSpaces</a> ), JavaCC( <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaC"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaCC</a> ), Jini (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jini</a> ), ...a very long list of R&D stuff. Sun Research was fucking elite, & staff engineers were considered outright geniuses. None of that cool R&D shit got any traction.<p>So what got traction ? Whatever yucky shit corporate America wanted - JavaBeans( <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Bean"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Beans</a> ), EJB (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EJ"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EJB</a> ), Swing (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)</a> ), various sorts of form-builders, table widgets, reporting shit, IDEs, classfile obfuscators,...<p>So Java became that. Rather than go down the R&D route, the pipeline became more corporate America oriented.<p>Haskell has always had very deep roots in academia - the focus on enabling the corporate American drone with Haskell is minimal, close to zero. So what do you expect ? The focus will be on debating types & building theorem provers, not on &quot;how to show big bank&#x27;s fourth quarter report in 3 colors with 7 columns and subtotals in single widget while data-binding seamlessly occurs in middle tier using enterprise beans built from beanfactoryfactory&quot; - this sort of shit that is commonplace in the Java EE world I inhabited post Sun, would be considered positively gauche in Haskell.",1389213586

7026368,comment,7024626,7026241,8,0,sillysaurus2,,,"Firstly, I want to be clear that I responded specifically to the idea that &quot;MIT license == somehow bad&quot;.  Releasing code under GPL is not in any way a bad thing, and I&#x27;m not arguing against the GPL.  People can do whatever they want, and there are a lot of solid reasons to prefer the GPL.  My purpose here is to stick up for fellow gamedevs, because it&#x27;s absurd to believe that we&#x27;re not interested in contributing to open source just because we prefer the MIT license.  I could name several gamedevs off the top of my head who have contributed in a big way to open source software.  Interestingly, they all tend to use MIT licenses.<p><i>Back then would you say &quot;system programmers are not going to ragequit the industry just because operating systems are closed source&quot;. But instead, they wrote open operating systems. Follow their example. Write a free engine. That&#x27;s the entire point.</i><p>The gamedev industry isn&#x27;t like other industries.  You can&#x27;t spend a decade writing an engine.  You therefore need talent in order to write a competitive non-toy engine.  This means you must work in the game industry for a period of time to get that talent. You also need to be brought up steeped in the sort of culture that makes you mentally inclined to open source your years of hard work rather than keeping it closed and proprietary.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a mistake to villify the MIT license -- you&#x27;re cutting off an entire generation of programmers from open source culture.  Specifically, the generation of programmers who want to be game developers.  The reason is because they are going to be working in the gamedev industry, and hence the MIT license is going to be their only option to participate in open source culture.  Villifying them will drive them away, and future talent will write proprietary closed-source engines as a result rather than free and open source ones.<p>In summary, villifying the MIT license is directly counterproductive to your philosophical goal of seeing less proprietary software.",1389213148

No.<p>MIT-license users are not bad guys -- I have both GPL and MIT code out there myself -- but choosing a non-copyleft license because it helps proprietary developers is not a good reason.

7026206,comment,7023299,7023799,3,0,latj,,,"The problem is that &quot;crap political work&quot; exists at all.<p>The normal way organizations try to decrease the amount of crap political work is to hire someone who just works on that crap all day. Managers.<p>Instinctively, you would think- this person produces nothing, adds nothing to the product, they should serve the actual workers. But this isnt usually the case.<p>Long term planning usually gets lumped into a manager&#x27;s work load because its not something that needs to be done to get today&#x27;s work completed. Because they are involved with planning future work, they end up owning that work later, hiring the people who do it, etc. There are also fewer of them in number and are more outspoken, so they end up being the one guy the bosses talk to.<p>Here is an alternate reality. An engineer comes up with a good idea for a new feature. He talks to his buddy DBA and SysAdmin. They think its a good idea so they agree to help out when they can. Engineer asks fresh out of college designer to help. Designer respects the reputation of the engineer and joins the team. A sales guy hears about the new feature and it sounds similar to something customers have been asking for so he tells them he can sell it. The bosses see a cluster forming in the corner and walk over and ask what they are up to. The feature is actually already implemented and being tested. Boss says it looks good, asks an analyst to see what its affect on factor x would be, walks on to a different cluster he sees forming across the room.<p>As their work on the feature is wrapping up people keep their ears open for the next project they&#x27;d like to work on.  Everyone moves on to other ideas. People with good ideas become the nucleus for new clusters. People with good skills become members. From time to time the bosses look at the islands- the people always sitting by themselves. Either they are genius uber productive people or they are people who will probably be gone soon.",1389211824

Again, I didn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s commercially available today for you to sell to your customers.<p>StackOverflow is not a good source, especially that thread, it is full of bad answers. I&#x27;ve read all of them. The first poster said: &quot;Those quantum states may encode classical information.&quot; The poster of the question has obviously no clue about physics and nobody in there mentioned teleportation of quantum entangled states, which you should  know, is instant.<p>Here&#x27;s a more detailed explanation, if you prefer that:<p>If you have a particle (such as a photons, electrons, or molecule) and have it physically interact with another particle, and then separate them, the result is that they can then both be described as being in the same quantum mechanical state. Basically, they are now the same, in factors such as position, momentum, spin, polarization, etc.<p>However, because we are dealing with quantum mechanics, the state of those particles remains undefined until measured (because it would then be forced to assume a specific state).<p>Now, how does this relate to instant data teleportation, you say? That’s the interesting part. You see, quantum entanglement is a form of quantum superposition (which I talked about in the aforementioned post about some quantum mechanics). This means that each particle that you have can be in any state. (Remember: observing a particle will force it to become a specific state). However, when you observe one of the particles, it will become a certain state, while the other particle becomes the opposite state. The change is completely instantaneous, and the particles can be anywhere — you could have your second particle on the other side of the planet and it would assume an equal and opposite state of it’s entangled counterpart. Instant data transfer.<p>Say you had a binary bit you wanted to transfer. First, you must entangle the bits. Then, put one of them on the other side of the globe. Observe one of them, forcing it to assume a certain state, and the other will instantly change. Like magic. Source: [1]<p>Ask me about latency here…\nHowever, you drifted the discussion to QT. My initial post was originally trying to  say that data can be transfered wirelessly faster than with a cable, or at least as fast. Latency cannot in such a system cannot be generalized, because it is dependant on the technology in the receiving side. If the receiving side uses optical fiber, you would need an architecture as described in  [2].<p>---<p>[1] <a href""http://programmingantics.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/quantum-entanglement-instant-data-teleportatio"" rel""nofollo"">http://programmingantics.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/quantum-en...</a><p>[2] <a href""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=522931"" rel""nofollo"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5...</a>",1389211743

I think my application has been stuck in some limbo and is now invisible to HR. I tried looking for a relevant email so that I can follow-up but this has been impossible. Granted, I found a graduate email I had written down 1 year ago but so far haven&#x27;t had any reply and the email seems deprecated because its not advertised on the website anymore. Even on on-campus events, Amazon recruiters would give only the website address, no emails.<p>Could anyone perhaps point me to someone I could ask to have a look?<p>edit: To clarify, I am certain the application has not been rejected.

I am not sure why you have problems testing the wrapper classes. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve encountered issues unit testing my controllers or other MVC specific components.<p>2. You test the attributes themselves as you would test any other class. Eg you test that OnActionExecuting etc yield the correct results. On your controller, you just need to test for the presence of the attribute, since you already know that it works as advertised.<p>3. I cannot comment on your claim about the Layout system, but I have absolutely no idea what you mean with the &#x27;having to hint the view engine&#x27;. You need to tell it which parts are inline code, and those parts should be C#. Razor has no interest in your JavaScript code.<p>4 and 5, again, can&#x27;t comment on these since I haven&#x27;t encountered them, even though I worked on a number of sites that had moments of extreme high load.

You&#x27;ve said elsewhere on this page that you want to write your own shell and such; the problem is that people don&#x27;t want IanSH, they want bash or zsh or whatever.

If so, I&#x27;ll add that to the list of reasons I could never be happy on a Mac. I will happily hold down Ctrl-V for as long as I need rather than trying to think in numbers, yes, absolutely, ESPECIALLY when the number I need is some number between, say 20 and 30. Thinking in exact number of things that I&#x27;ll need interferes with the (mental) registers I&#x27;m using to hold all of the code I&#x27;m thinking about.

There&#x27;s a skill to creating macros like that, of course, but <i>really</i> learning to use a powerful GUI editor is a life-long experience. It just happens to have a shorter and almost infinitely less painful learning curve at the beginning than vim.<p>The problem is that some people (such as apparently the developer I was replying to) learn the basics and never any more. That&#x27;s true of users of all editors, I&#x27;m sure. But just because 95%+ of GUI editor users don&#x27;t ever go beyond the basics doesn&#x27;t mean that there isn&#x27;t power hidden under the surface. Maybe more vim users delve deep into its power, statistically speaking. I submit that says more about the kind of person who would use vim than it does about the power of vim relative to (modern) GUI editors.",1379955159

Yes, there were many corner cases, even two centuries ago, but it was &quot;good enough&quot; approximately always.  Why make messy legislation over small problems?  The Constitution never even tried to touch these issues.<p>Over time the importance of all those corner cases has expanded, and the increased rate of growth of that importance is downright dizzying in the last decade or two.<p>In today&#x27;s world we have our old fashioned physical privacy (for the most part), and HIPAA to cover some narrow issues.  That is it.<p>In our brave new world, we do not really own our financial transaction records.  For the most part those are privately owned records in the hands of various profit-driven corporations, and some of them happen to send us a copy of a subset of those records every month.<p>rayiner (above) discusses this topic rather well.  But I want to emphasize a different point: we can have privacy but we need to recognize we are basically starting from scratch.  Trying to bemoan that the laws have been broken is <i>counterproductive</i> -- the spies have good lawyers and they have <i>correctly</i> identified gigantic legal loopholes.  Even if privacy advocates win a few battles, the spies are still going to win the war, until we change the basic rules of the game with new legislation.",1379955038

If you really, truly want to learn about how an OS works, you&#x27;re going to need to get your hands dirty and learn about the kernel.  There are so many tradeoffs made on the kernel side of things which impact userspace, and knowing about them impacts the decisions you&#x27;re going to make in terms how how you configure software and which software you&#x27;re going to use.<p>If you can afford it and have a week to spare, I&#x27;d really recommend taking the Linux Foundation&#x27;s one week crash course on the kernel.  It talks about how the scheduler works, gives you insight into modules, how processes and threads work and hooks the kernel libraries give you for semaphores, mutexes, etc.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s well worth the money.<p><a href=""http://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/development-training/linux-kernel-internals-and-debugging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/developmen...</a>",1379954220

That is racist. You are generalizing a continent of people into one homogenous ethnicity.<p>Of course the author wouldn&#x27;t group &quot;black people&quot; into a category. Firstly, &quot;black people&quot; are the most genetically diverse group of people on the planet. Africa is also home to again, many, many cultures.<p>I think you attempting to be PC, has clouded your judgement. Look at your upvote/downvote ratio. Do you believe most people are just &quot;ignorant&quot; to your &quot;valid and true&quot; beliefs on political correctness? You said it yourself that this is just casual racism.

Pretty much everything I read was a net positive for the product, the only quibble might be the price but of all the things you can change in the future that is easiest to change :-).<p>I was intrigued by the music keyboard, not because I think the Surface is the instrument of the future, but because I think there is a market for a device which can easily customize its input experience like that. I have thought for a while that future test equipment from Tektronix or Agilent might look like that but with a scope control panel and a dock for attaching probes.<p>Like the 2 position kickstand, the one we got at work to do testing on that was annoying. I bet Surface 3 touts an infinitely adjustable one :-).<p>I think the ARM/x86 messaging is pretty spot on as well, Microsoft is playing the &quot;its just windows&quot; card pretty hard and dropping the RT moniker was smart too. Most consumers could care less about instruction set architecture. And what happens when Apple makes an Air with the A7 ? Will Apple have the 2 x 2 matrix (iOS/MacOS)(ARM/x86)? and Microsoft the 1 x 2 matrix (Windows)(ARM/x86) ? I&#x27;d think the latter long term is easier to message and less confusing for customers. If they go all Ubuntu like and create a Win 8.1 phone experience then there product / os vector is 1x3 (Windows)(phone/tablet/laptop).<p>That said, for me it reinforces the notion that this is the year of the Linux desktop. I recently had the experience of using a USB serial cable that worked under Linux but not under Windows 7.

The only way for this to be consistent is if they&#x27;re only penalizing pages displaying competing advertising products.<p>The author also shows a screengrab of Google&#x27;s own results page, where we can see that everything visible on the monitor is sponsored content, with no organic search results at all.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m perplexed about what point you were trying to make by suggesting this link, but it was interesting.",1379952485

Which would be part of the reason I&#x27;d never heard of that. The A6 chip is designed and manufactured by Samsung. Apple may have had a hand in encouraging them to go 64bit on something that uses a GB of memory, because why else would Samsung do that. But that doesn&#x27;t exactly count.<p>It is not much faster because the amount of memory is not enough to make the technology really useful. The technology uses more memory than 32bit. Many tests have been conducted on this kind of thing 64bit isn&#x27;t new. It has been shown that using less than 4GB of memory with a 64bit processor can often result in slower speeds.<p>Let alone like I mentioned that all the 32bit apps now have to run on top of another layer in the OS. And, apps that take advantage of 64bit will either not run on any other device, or they will have separate versions for 64bit and 32bit. Or they will simply be 32bit.<p>Which will I would imagine be the case for at least a little while.<p>I was referring to the Nexus 4 in my price comparison. A phone which is in the process of being replaced with a new version very soon. It&#x27;s a good phone.<p>More pixels my eye can&#x27;t see at what distance? It&#x27;s a handheld device I&#x27;ll hold it at whatever distance I want to. 720p is a reasonable resolution to expect.

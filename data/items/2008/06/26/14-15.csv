The web framework or system architecture are usually the pain point. And with Rails, you have to abuse establish_connection if you're going to have each web head read from multiple shards.<p>The easiest route I've gone when setting up a sharded infrastructure is to use subdomains and a 1-1 Web:DB setup.  Have each subdomain go (either thru a reverse proxy or hardware load balancer) to a different (sharded) webhead.  Each web head talks to two databases- the common database and its sharded DB.  With this you'll probably want a ""common"" web head to handle home page traffic and authentication (after they are authenticated they'd get dished off to their shard).<p>Salesforce.com was my inspiration for this method, and it is probably reasonably common.  It probably also has a name, but I do not know what it is.",1214490795

Also, given the level of specialization involved with some open problems (and the overwhelmingly large amount of data involved in all of mathematics), it is certainly possible that someone deeply specializing in an aspect of mathematics not ""popular"" at the time could make a non-negligible contribution to mathematics even if they started late in life, and were less ""smart"" than their ""prodigy"" peers.<p>If you start mathematics late in life, you are extraordinarily unlikely to find your name on a list with names like Gauss, Newton, and Archimedes.  Nor will you likely reach any sort of par with Euler, Hilbert, or Russell.  Indeed, even the levels of Conway, Shannon, and Wiles are probably unattainable.  But math is a huge field now, and there are parts of it that most young mathematicians find boring, or simply aren't exposed to.

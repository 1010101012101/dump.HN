That's much of my point, I went looking at the source, to check for myself. But the best case scenario is aggregating a series of CSV files which you have to locate manually, something an actual news article would have done for themselves. Further analysis would be to move past the absolute number of citizens dropping citizenship and perhaps calculate the proportion of citizens doing so. We could even hope to run some simple tests to determine if the number of expats was statistically significant.<p>Instead we get none of that, just a vague, ""Taxes are complicated, expats are increasing, trust me."" It's very disappointing.",1368080979

In his initial correspondence, he asks for clarification: is he actually engaged in operating a money transmission service, or is he an exempt payment processor?<p>That seems like a simple question but the bureaucrats he's dealing with don't provide an answer. Instead, they appear to latch on to his correspondence and treat it as a representation that he <i>is</i> engaged in money transmission and therefore subject to the MTA. That's not exactly surprising: if he is subject to the MTA, there's a license involved, which generates revenue for the state.<p>This leaves an interesting unanswered question: was the author ever subject to the law in the first place? Perhaps the competitors who you suggest are flouting the law brought the matter to their legal counsel, who concluded that they were exempt. That doesn't mean that they aren't, but the lack of prosecutions hints that this isn't an unreasonable possibility.<p>One final comment about breaking the law: financial services are highly regulated and given the number of laws and regulations at the federal and state levels, I don't think <i>any</i> company in this space can ever be certain that it is not breaking <i>some</i> law. One thing is for sure however: if you're running a financial services company and have questions about a law, allowing legal counsel to research the matter and handle any correspondence with regulators is the best approach.",1368080962

So Apple's restriction SLOWS things down. At the same time besides computing the formula the plotting application does mostly calling UI function (drawing, 3d stuff, etc.) and waits for user interaction (zooming, rotating, ...). You can write that part in any language - it is mostly calling platform functionality. So in this domain it either don't matter (because the UI code is mostly calling to the platform) or is getting worse because of Apple's policies (because you can't compile complicated formulas on the device, because that would violate Apple's developer restrictions).",1271064113

I've become somewhat sensitive to what I'm doing on my computer since I started using a laptop at home instead of a desktop computer. I usually avoid watching long videos or generally using any Flash app not only because it eats up power terribly when it works, but I may find a defunct Flash process hanging there eating up some 20% of CPU even after I close the page with Flash. The problem seems to have gone away lately, but bugs are bugs, you can't expect exceptional quality from Adobe. Neither from any other developer, especially if we are talking about cross-platform runtimes.<p>Apple's decision starts making <i>some</i> sense to me now (I don't develop for iPhone, so the ongoing drama is rather distant for me). The choice of languages - C/C++/Objective-C - clearly indicates that Apple wants efficiency, not just quality. Just add one layer between the language and the CPU (e.g. a virtual machine) and your phone's battery will die 5 times faster.<p>I'm sorry for the dynamic language folks, but we are back to the era of bits and bytes, at least when it comes to smaller mobile devices.

They've made significant gains in responsiveness since then, and solved most (all?) of the things he complained about.<p>That being said, the system doesn't feel as 'instant' as the iPhone or a fast Android phone.  However, you can often get things done faster than competing platforms because the workflow is so streamlined.<p>Moving to a 1Ghz processor like the Snapdragon would probably bring responsiveness up to parity with other systems.",1271063064

It can make Ruby code exceptionally powerful, but it does effectively obscure the traditional stack trace, which can make trouble for people that don't understand what's going on. I landed in the Ruby camp (and honestly, I think I prefer it a bit to Python, just personally), but they're both great languages, both have strong communities, and will both serve you well in a number of ways.<p>There are lots of people that are professionally successful in both Python and Ruby. Both have vibrant communities, lots of supporting frameworks and libraries, and lots of success stories.<p>My personal observation is that Python tends to lean towards structure and convention; Ruby tends to lean towards flexibility and malleability. One of Ruby's biggest claims is that it's mindblowingly easy to write your own DSL in Ruby. Things like rake, rspec, cucumber, and the like are exceptionally powerful tools that aren't easily replicated in Python. This can lead to extremely readable, usable code abstractions. The price for this is that the underlying implementation can be somewhat hard to follow until you have a good grasp on Ruby's various tricks. In short, Ruby is far less principled than Python is, but that grants it an agility that Python can't achieve. Depending on what you need, either may be the right tool for the job.",1271063054

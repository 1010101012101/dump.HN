Schneier needs to protect himself from the possibility of either his data being used in a manner to prosecute or punish or action taken to stifle work he has so far kept private. It&#x27;s more than reasonable for him to give credence to the threat of a self-interested government agency acting maliciously toward him.<p>However, Schneier was a target well before this due to the nature of his work. It is exactly the scope of the recent revelations that throws the conventional thinking on where the fuzzy line between an appropriate risk assessment based on position of interest and the general population.

It&#x27;s a convenient target, organizing memories and suitors and character in a psychologically-exploitative document.<p>I don&#x27;t think Facebook generates envy, or even facilitates it. It just organizes it. I think if you feel envy and jealousy you&#x27;re going to spread it out among lots of anxieties or maybe focus it on Facebooknot necessarily experience more of it.<p>Besides, think of all the healthy interactions we get from Facebook. It lets the folks who have a hard time selling themselves in real life advertise their character in an uninhibited way. We get to advertise the pretty sides and the ugly sides of ourselves, if we choose.<p>It&#x27;s like any form of expression. Generally good I think. Though I did read lately that learning how to broadcast is not the same as learning how to converse, and maybe that&#x27;s the root poison. It is fundamentally about selling yourself and sharing a lot, which isn&#x27;t always a healthy thing.<p>Especially for relationships.",1379214632

In FPTP, you just have to cater to a plurality of the voters in your district.  You very specifically do not and should not &quot;govern for all&quot;.  Out of a U.S. population of 313 million, you should govern for a group of perhaps 50,000 (less, really) people in your district - the only ones capable of voting you out of office.  The U.S. has a huge number of extraordinarily radical and pain-in-the-ass representatives - over a quarter of the U.S. House is currently trying to force the country to default on its debts, because those are the views of the pertinent slice of their individual electorates.<p>You seem basically to be upset at the idea that any politician might exist with any sort of radical-to-you views.  You seem to prefer stultifying politics, where a few rich white men meet together over brandy and decide what&#x27;s going to happen, and everyone follows along nicely.  That preference is not shared by everyone, or even most people.  PR allows views with wide but shallow representation to get represented in government, and that&#x27;s considered a good thing by most people.",1379214251

Customers would type in the web address into Google search instead of the address bar.<p>Once the website disappeared from the Internet the only way customers could find the site was by Google adwords which went from spending $150 a day to $500 a day. A total win for Google I guess!<p>It was impossible to spend $500 a day forever, I put the website (the same website, no changes) onto a new domain and now it spends about $200 a day in Google adwords.  Much better.  I seemed to have received the worst possible webspam action for really very little.  Consider other site buy thousands of links.. my 20 links were small potatoes that I thought would fly under the radar.<p>The whole incident cost about $100,000+ in sales mostly from customers who if they just knew how to use the address bar would have made it to the website.<p>When I see other websites have issues with Google, I know it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to bring a great deal of Google issues upon them.  Google if they wants to can just remove them or send them to page 200 and since Google gets 80% or so of searches and people don&#x27;t know how to use the address bar the website is going to have to buy Adwords in order to stay online or change domains (assuming it is not an on-page issue).",1379214207

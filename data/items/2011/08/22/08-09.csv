I'm not advocating pulling master (or whatever the base branch is) often and merging whenever, so that you end up with loads of pointless merges. Once your feature is done, you merge once. This makes point 3 pretty much moot, since bisect handles merges just fine.<p>Sometimes you need to update your code on top of a new base because of some important bugfix or something, and then it's fine to rebase, but I don't think it should be the default.<p>I'll accept point 2, though I think git's merging is good enough that it's not noticeable in most cases. If you rebase you also lose information about the conflicts which may be undesirable. Someone might want to review your merge to see if you have solved the conflicts correctly.",1314002901

Tell him you want unsupervised access so that he won't see exactly what you install, so it will be harder for him to disable it.<p>You then in fact install filtering software on his computer. No doubt he'll find this and easily bypass it. That's OK, because during your unsupervised access you ALSO install custom firmware on his router.<p>This custom firmware looks for porn, but does <i>not</i> block it. Instead, it randomly replaces a small fraction of the images with images of porn your friend finds disgusting. For instance, if his interest is straight porn with no kinks, get images from some fetish site that features naked fat men defecting on masturbating barely legal boys, or something worse. Go wild here.<p>This should greatly reduce his interest in porn sites (or greatly broaden his tastes...so I guess there is some risk!).",1314002660
2911830,comment,2910571,2910571,9,0,Facens,,,"-------------------------------------------------------------------<p><i>Short answer to the question</i><p>Any of the current solutions to the Privacy Policy / TOS problem make you waste money and time. I've experienced this problem myself and decided to solve this hell of hassle once and for all, creating a privacy policy generator that is <i>really</i> compliant, with a company making money behind (and this grants quality), built to speak web designers' language (not lawyers' one), allowing to generate a fully-customized high-quality privacy policy within 3 minutes, by pressing a few buttons.<p>Here's the website: <a href=""http://www.iubenda.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iubenda.com</a>\nI'm the founder.<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<p>-<p># Small intro<p>As a web designer I've always faced this problem myself, that terrible hassle of getting rid of the privacy policy. Two years ago I told myself: why the hell nobody solves this problem once and for all? \nSo, I started working on iubenda (<a href=""http://www.iubenda.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iubenda.com</a>), with the goal of giving any website owner in the world a way to generate a Privacy Policy without having to read a single legalese word.<p>After a whole year of thinking, another year of cust dev, a seed round and even the awesome Seedcamp experience, we are here to conquer the footer of every website in the world :P<p>To date we have 2k people waiting to try out the product, we're approaching 1M pageviews served by our privacy policy icon, we have 100 beta testers and we're able to generate a privacy policy both in English and Italian languages.<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<p>-<p># Why <i>every</i> solution mentioned is a mess (most of the times)<p>If you have to spend money and time on that boring document that nobody reads (aka privacy policy), the best you can hope is that the money is actually well spent.<p>The tough truth? Most of the times it's not, and I'll explain why.<p>-<p>## What are Privacy Policies about?<p>A Privacy Policy must inform the users visiting a website about the personal data collected, the use of those data, the parties involved (first and third parties) and few other minimal things.<p>The problem here is that <i>every</i> website is slightly different, different because is using different services collecting different data. Any web designer can get it, on some websites you put Google Analytics, on some others Google Analytics <i>and</i> Google Adsense, sometimes you use Mailchimp to manage a mailing list, and so on.<p>Now, the problem is that most of the privacy policies I read don't mention these services, making the privacy policy completely useless.<p>-<p>## So, you're basically telling me that I payed $1k for my privacy policy, and IT IS USELESS?<p>Yeah dude, the privacy policy <i>can't be general</i>, it must be specific, or it's just like not having a privacy policy at all.\nOf course you can fall into this hole while copy/pasting, while paying for a lawyer or while using a low-quality generator. Sometimes you may of course find a good lawyer or a good web company (like TRUSTe), but that kind of lawyer/service is usually expensive.<p>-<p>## Not <i>every</i> lawyer writes wrong privacy policies: here's a simple way to check yours<p>Try to ask your lawyer what a ""cookie"" actually is. \nMost will start talking about chocolate biscuits.<p>-<p>## So, what?<p>Since the world is never white or black, the Privacy Policy World is not about having or not having a privacy policy, there's a gray area in the middle: having a privacy policy that <i>sucks</i>. Sad but true, this is the most common situation.<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<p>-<p># Carrot after the stick<p>After analyzing this situation and getting to the conclusion above (privacy policies are expensive, and they even suck), I simply started working on a solution, and here I tell you what I did.<p>-<p>## Rethinking the Privacy Policy from scratch<p>The Privacy Policy model had to be rebuilt from scratch. The current model was a lawyer's parturition, but the only thing that lawyers are able to build is boring documents that nobody ever read. How can you accept such a state of things?<p>So I studied the law to extract the naked privacy requirements: personal data collected, use of those data, parties involved (first and third parties).<p>-<p>## Personal data<p>The personal data collected depend on the services used on the website, such as Google Analytics or Google Adsense. Other ways to collect data are the mailing list, the registration form, the comment system. All these uses are standardized, they're the same on every website.\nSince the web design world is moving fast to SaaS services, outsourcing most of the personal data collection, the standardization is even increasing.<p>-<p>## Use of the data<p>Another requirement for the Privacy Policy is the data collection purpose, but if the world is made of websites using standardized services, the purpose corresponds to the purpose of those services, like ""analytics"" or ""advertising"".\nAnother point is gone.<p>-<p>## Parties involved<p>The website itself will always be an involved party, but what about the others?\nWait, those SaaS services have a company behind, and that company is that third party we are looking for (such as Google for Google Analytics). Bingo!<p>-<p>## We have the ingredients, now the recipe<p>The next step was to put this all into a simple UI, allowing to generate a Privacy Policy with all the complexity hidden behind.<p><i>The good news is that we made it.</i><p>The model required a database made of privacy policy pieces referring to the standardized services (Google Analytics, etc), with some room for customization too (e.g. Registration forms don't always ask the same information). \nThese pieces had to be assembled like a puzzle, and that's the reason why software exists.<p>-<p>## Who's more clever than me?<p>Ok, I'm kidding. The truth is that the process is simple, very simple, but quite powerful. And it generates beautiful privacy policies with nearly no effort. Completely awesome.<p>FYI, my cat on the keyboard says: ""'0p""<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<p>-<p># SO WHAT?!<p>Ehm, I spent a whole hour writing this comment, you spent a few minutes of your valuable time to read.<p>Since our motto is ""conquering the footer of every website in the world"", I feel more or less like Brain from ""Pinky and the Brain"":\n- What are we going to do tonight, Brain?\n- The same thing we do every night, Pinky... Try and take over the world!<p>If you're interested in solving once and for all that hell of hassle of writing a privacy policy (w/ TOS coming soon), be sure to try out our product:<p><a href=""http://www.iubenda.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iubenda.com</a><p>(we're in private beta, but out moving fast)<p>Ah, of course we rely on a strong legal cofounder ;)",1314002618

It's a ""the enemy of your enemy is not necessarily your friend"" scenario; he's not wrong, but he's also totally full of shit.<p>Look at a site like Vimeo and tell me that beauty and passion aren't critical aspects of this design. Then head on over to AirBnB or Kickstarter or Etsy and tell me that they didn't put a huge amount of design thinking into making a clean, modern site that makes the visitor feel like they are making a difference by participating in a consumer revolution.<p>Good design extends far beyond logos and colour swatches. To have good design means that you've thought through every interaction path so that you can manipulate how your visitor <i>feels</i> when they use your site or product. You need to connect with their limbic brains first, and only then are you in the best position to really understand how to maximize their ROI.<p>TL:DR; this is bad advice.

I would bet this would result in more people having to click than the current situation (in spite of the annoyances reported in this thread).<p>2) be more conservative with corrections and offer a ""did you mean"" more often. 500,000 results for ""uncollege"" and the fact that correcting it to ""college"" repeats a word in the query string is a good argument for this particular case, at least. On the other hand, testing for ""[some random word] and uncollege"" never seems to correct for uncollege unless the other word is education related, which is interesting.

2911805,comment,2910187,2911073,1,0,chousuke,,,"namespaces in combination with how syntax-quote (`) autoqualifies symbols and let disallowing qualified identifiers makes it noticeably more difficult to introduce a name clash.<p>for example the following macro results in an error when you try to run the expanded code: \n  (defmacro ex [x] `(let [y 1] (~x y)))<p>because it expands to (let [namespace/y 1] ...) which is disallowed. When you need to, there is a way to force an unqualified symbol by explicitly quoting and unquoting a symbol, and ` provides autogensyms, so it is very convenient to use.<p>Namespace-qualifying also means that post-expansion changes to your local namespace won't change the meaning of symbols that referred to things in an external namespace when the macro was expanded.",1314001643

Just to clarify, I'm talking real strong, static typing like in Ocaml, Haskell and the likes and not Java-style typing, which is not very powerful and imposes the cost of adding type information on the developer, whereas in the aforementioned languages the type inference pretty much does away with this problem.<p>This having said, I'd suggest taking a look at the new programming language: Opa (<a href=""http://opalang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opalang.org</a>). It complies with most of the requests of the author of the article. It's compiled (#2) and statically typed (#1). It allows easy interfacing with JS, C and Ocaml (#3). First class XML elements: yup (#4); case sensitivity: check (#7) and JS is automatically generated from Opa sources (#8).

Generally when looking to recruit a designer, it would be their design skills your after; not their legal advice or ability to write in marketing jargon.  Look for people whose designs you like, preferably who have produced something similar to the look you're after before.  Find someone you can build a relationship with, where they can talk you through their subject in your language.  If you're a small business with no technical skills, your ""web designer"" should be someone who describes the whole process of getting a site on-line up front, and who offers ways for you to maintain that site yourself, without having to pay them each time you want a few lines of text added. If you're a larger business, or a developer who lacks graphics skills, you'll probably be focussed on just the design side, and will want someone who uses technologies compatible with what's in your toolkit, people who have experience working alongside programmers, and perhaps those who understand how to optimise their designs for performance.\nEveryone's requirements are different, so the designer they're after will also be different.  Look at what these designers have done before, and look at their customers' feedback, and pay particular attention to those customers who seem to be the most similar to yourself.",1314000726

(This will be easier than it sounds at first, because you have a bowl of paid-for, high-quality content right in front of you).<p>Most of the addiction behaviour comes from the inconsistent reward schedule that you get when searching for content and sometimes finding some and sometimes not. If you switch this over to a behaviour where, if you feel like it, you look at some content for an hour and then be done with it, you will find that this is not any more addicting than TV or a netflix subscription.<p>Note that from a cultural/moral standpoint, you may prefer either of the solutions (including getting a filtered DNS connection) - it's really multiple ways to reach the preferred goal (i.e. getting rid of the addiction behaviour) and a matter of taste which one you like best.<p>An alternative would be to write a proxy that (i) bans all video content outside a handful of whitelisted domains, and (ii) transforms all images outside a handful of whitelisted domains to grayscale.<p>This will be minimally disruptive to your web browsing experience when it comes to news etc. (since news is just as good when it has only grayscale images) while it should strongly limit the appeal of any primarily visual content.",1314000725

In government, we have soldiers, FBI agents, CDC researchers, traffic engineers, and prosecutors, all front-line workers who are paid and promoted according to their performance.  Soldiers don't become SEALs through seniority.  In all of those fields we find it adequate to rely on the judgment of peers and superiors, augmented with whatever metrics are deemed useful.<p>It would expose teachers to injustice and favoritism, sure.  So what?  Those are professional hazards we all face.  It is teachers themselves who inform us that grades are always imperfect measurements of performance yet must be accepted because they play a constructive  role in our system of education.  It is in school that we learn how favoritism and personal animosity affect the official story of our performance.  Those are important lessons because they prepare us to work in a world where judgment is necessary but perfect justice is never achieved.  Don't you find it ironic that teachers refuse to submit to any unscientific and less-than-perfectly-just evaluation of their performance when they themselves teach children to accept such evaluations as an inevitable fact of modern life?",1307303110

However, just to be sure I understand you correctly:<p>Is the module functor compiled only once, or once for every parameter type? I'm asking because if it's compiled only once, the generated code might be significantly less optimized. This might not play a role for complex parameter types, but could miss lots of good optimization opportunities for simple types such as int or char. How is this solved in those languages?<p>Also, is it just OCaml and Coq, or is this possible with other strongly typed languages (such as Haskell) as well?",1307302521

My net worth is doing fine - if I didn't live in the Bay Area, I could probably buy a house free and clear in most parts of the country.<p>Your 20s are the best time to take financial risks.  After you get kids and a mortgage, you have responsibilities that really do make it difficult to spend any length of time without an income.  But in your 20s, you can live cheaply, you don't have anyone depending on you, and you're still figuring out what you want to do with your life.  Taking some time off from the corporate meatgrinder can pay some big dividends in increased skills and self-knowledge that make it more than worthwhile later.<p>Just be smart about it.

At 69.95, it was cheap enough to be an impulse buy for most people, cheap enough that kids saved up their paper-round money.<p>A lot of early buyers ended up building their ZX81s from a kit (because it was 20 cheaper) and learned a lot. Even for those that bought it pre-assembled, there wasn't much to do but learn.

The keyboard was covered in markings for BASIC shortcuts.<p>At the time, several magazines consisted of little more than printed source code, mainly for games, that you could type in yourself.

My first thought is to keep the data as .csv files on Amazon S3 or some other persistent storage network. Getting a database tuned is tough even when you know what data you have up front. Hadoop wouldn't be quite as bad but it still wouldn't be trivial.<p>If you do that, I would recommend looking at WEKA's arff file format. It's a really clunky file format but it captures a bunch of meta data (data types, max/min, etc) needed by many typical machine learning algorithms. You could capture that type of data as the data is being loaded, which would make later analysis easier.<p>After that, you'd have a situation where you can either stream the data out of the csv files or chunk the files into subsets for use in map-reduce type algorithms. I'm not sure what the performance is like when you start requesting the middle of a large file from S3, though.<p>As for a stats package, if you know python, I'd go with it. There are a few stats packages already out there that seem pretty good. But really, if you're just going to do basic stats like averages, st. dev, moving averages over time, etc, those are pretty trivial to implement. That might be beneficial if you have very large data sets that can't fit in memory at once and a custom way of accessing data.<p>I should say I haven't used a lot of the newer whiz-bang analytics setups that have been coming out, but in general my experience has been that working around the idiosyncrasies of stats packages is usually more difficult than implementing my own methods while using their code as a reference.<p>My final advice is to not adopt an analytics framework that has to be the top level of the program. You really need to be able to control the analytics engine programatically from your application. Stay away from systems that make you create modules or data flows inside their application, and the only way to modify them is inside a gui or a complex config file. These systems are everywhere. They are nice as a high-powered replacement for Excel but not when you are trying to develop a software application.",1307300415

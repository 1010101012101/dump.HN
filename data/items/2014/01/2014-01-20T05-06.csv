7087822,comment,7086726,7087740,3,0,_delirium,,,"If it&#x27;s spare HOV capacity, then I agree. But if adding the electric cars to HOV lanes increases the congestion in HOV lanes, it might degrade their effectiveness in incentivizing the behaviors they currently incentivize. For example, the attractiveness of either carpooling or riding the bus declines if HOV lanes get slower. Carpooling in particular needs enough of a delta in the regular v. HOV trip times to make up for having to pick up the other carpool members (unless you live in the same place).<p>One solution is to allow a capped number in, to incentivize purchase but only up to a threshold that doesn&#x27;t overly degrade HOV trip times. I believe that&#x27;s what California did for hybrids, allowing HOV usage for the first N purchased.",1390197141

Building Pixar over 10 years into one of the top movie studios was not some &quot;shrewd&quot; business decision. Ditto for NeXT, the early Mac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad.. It&#x27;s more accurate to say he was a visionary who took a long term view.<p>It&#x27;s only in retrospect that we have the luxury of looking on his track record as smart from a business standpoint. Woz even criticizes the early Mac for losing money. Says Scully saved the company. Which tells you a lot about what separates Woz from Jobs.<p>Folks like Woz were a big influence on Jobs. So were a bunch of other people. The idea that he just took other peoples&#x27; ideas and marketed them is the same old trope. He took the best raw, undeveloped ideas from the billions around him and fit them to together and refined them into something accessible to everyone. VERY FEW people can do that well.

7087798,comment,7085682,7086363,2,0,Mikera,,,"Agree with everything you say, but it is worth noting that the insights you get from static analysis on desugared forms (which can be very large and complex!) is much harder to interpret than static analysis on the original forms.<p>So to make static analysis tools useful on macros, they really need some way to map back to the original source forms. Not all tools do this (either at all, or well) - and to the extent that they don&#x27;t it is an big impediment for static analysis.<p>Also the killer challenge: macro expansion in Clojure can depend on a mutable environment at the time of macro expansion. This makes it impossible to do reliable static analysis, unless you are able to recreate the runtime environment at the time of macro expansion in your static analysis tool, which is hard/impossible in general.<p>This is part of the motivation for my little Kiss language experiment: with immutable environments you can keep the power of macros, but avoid the mutable environment problem. Ideally, macro expansion would be governed only by things that are provably compile-time constants (not sure how feasible this is while maintaining the dynamic flexibility of Clojure that we all love... but it&#x27;s an attractive idea at least).",1390196627

Many restaurants still have flash-intros, PDF menus and other annoyances that make those sites far less useful than a 3rd party site that has translated all that data into something that works consistently on my phone.<p>The other point I would point out is that ordering online does not require working with a restaurant. Many of these delivery services are &quot;hacking&quot; delivery by becoming the delivery provider. They just order on your behalf, pick up the food, and drive it to your home regardless of whether the restaurant offers that option or not.",1390194517

Based on what he told me, it sounded like Red Flag positioned themselves as the official Linux of China, which meant they would be specified and required by Chinese government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Red Flag then told the Chinese government that to make Red Flag Linux successful, they would need government funding. With a nascent team, simple product, and this funding in hand, they they went to the big players in the PC and server ecosystems (Intel, etc.) and said that if those companies wanted their hardware sold in China, it would need Red Flag Linux, and Red Flag could provide consulting services to make sure Red Flag Linux ran well on their hardware.<p>According to the guy I talked to, the Red Flag management team then embezzled most all of the money from the government and US, Japanese, and European companies and left an understaffed team of developers to deliver on the contracts with the foreign companies.<p>Another Chinese friend said years ago that many Chinese tech entrepreneurs were &quot;just making money off the investors.&quot; It didn&#x27;t make sense to me until I heard the Red Flag story.",1390194216

Then once you&#x27;ve figured that out, you need to get the projection and the optics to line up precisely- unless you can figure out a way to build in some tolerance to the alignment of the projection.<p>Aside from that, the goal is essentially the same.

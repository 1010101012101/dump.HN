It is by far the most popular social network today. It is also probably the most redesigned site on the entire Web with new Facebook designs launching almost monthly. As a result, it is also the most debated site when it comes to the design. Lastly, I find it to be one of the buggiest sites on the Web especially when it comes to uploading pictures and videos.
iLoader  for iPhone is the perfect companion for your iPhone/iPod Touch and it completely changes the experience of uploading content to Facebook from the ground up.",1267635561

So this isn't an ad hominem attack... unless you're a factory farmer, in which case, you probably are. ;-)<p>People eat more meat at more meals than they ever have in history. The truth is that it's unsustainable and it causes huge long term problems for our environment. The fact that we have always done it doesn't really matter. We know we can live without it and be healthy. The question is should we continue to do it and if so, at what cost? And as hackers, we might ask if there's a way around it.<p>Comparing loss of human life in the deadliest war that humans have ever fought (where most of us have no problem labeling certain actors evil) perfectly illustrates the magnitude of the ""magic"" large numbers. The very best killing apparatus that war has ever seen is beat by factory farming in one country in 3 days. I find that to be truly incredible.<p>Maybe you don't want to stop eating meat. But maybe you do care about some of the problems the world faces because of it (water shortages, global warming, human famine, rainforest depletion, run-off into other food and streams, mad cow or swine flu, etc).<p>For many people this is a truly emotional issue. A judgement about factory farms feels like a judgement about themselves. I was once at a very expensive conference (like $2k a ticket) and after a speaker suggested that people cut their meat intake to solve some the world's problems about a 1/3 of the people got up and left. But most people who don't eat meat today did at one point in their lives. I'm part of a family that until I left college ate meat at every meal.<p>It's not enough to say we're going to keep doing what we're doing because we've been doing it forever. As hackers and entrepreneurs we know that human behavior can change and we often try to be the ones who cause it. We don't happily accept the status quo. So why do so many of us readily do so when it comes to eating meat?",1267635350

First to market is already a huge competitive advantage.<p>Patents are a huge part of the reason you're paying so much for health insurance right now.

The patenter isn't doing <i>shit</i> with the idea, yet they have a <i>20-year</i> monopoly on it.<p>Oh, and they also happen to be a huge monolithic organization with thousands of employees worldwide that is patenting thousands of ideas every year, yet actually implementing only a small fraction of those ideas.<p>Don't think this happens? You don't know much about patents then. The patent system is one of the best examples of an idea backfiring on itself that I know of.

1164488,comment,1163873,1164316,0,0,sueders100,,,"I don't feel Steve Jobs is notable solely because he 'consistently raises the bar', but his approach to creation. Jay-z admitted in his lyrics where he says ""I wanna rhyme like Common Sense, but i did five Mil,
I ain't been rhymin' like Common since"" that he prefers to be more profitable rather than to fulfill his desire to rap about what he wants to. Biggie doesn't have a catalog(2 studio albums) large enough to really say that he consistently raises the bar. Also both Biggie and Tupac came from an era that produced Naughty by Nature, A Tribe Called Quest, Nas, The Wu-Tang Clan and many others. It's a bit much they raised the bar when there were others around pushing hip hop at least as far. But I digress, the ways in which you can draw similarities to Kanye and Steve Jobs is that they prize aesthetics, are known for creating what they see as ideal, a disdain for compromise, going against the grain and being extremely successful at what they do. So I think Kanye is far more analogous to Steve Jobs than anyone else in hip hop.",1267635086

But that is because there was no competition.<p>That strategy is to rely on a first-mover advantage which is now well known as a poor business strategy. Someone else could easily come along and conduct basic SEO marketing and gets a bunch of links, then you're playing catch up or too busy moving on to another niche.<p>If on the other hand you conduct more thorough marketing (explained in the post) after finding this niche, it may turn out to be a sustainable business.<p>From my experience, finding the unexploited opportunities and ranking in google is the easy part. Turning that into a real and scalable business is the hard part and that takes quite a bit of marketing effort (understanding your customers, promotion, PR etc).",1267632447

When first interviewed about this, the sound engineers claimed that they had used a vocoder, in what Sound on Sound perceived as an attempt to preserve a trade secret.[7] After the massive success of ""Believe,"" many artists imitated the technique. It was evident in songs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some notable examples are Gigi D'Agostino's ""La Passion"" and Janet Jackson's US #1 hit ""All For You,"" among many others. After years of relative dormancy, the effect was revived in the mid-2000s by R&B singer T-Pain, who elaborated on the effect in contemporary popular music by making active use of it in his songs, a style that has since gone on to be imitated by numerous other R&B and pop artists[8] such as Kanye West and, more recently, Jamie Foxx in his hit song, ""Blame It"".[9]</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-Tune"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-Tune</a>",1267632111

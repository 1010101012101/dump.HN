4078633,comment,4076834,4078183,6,0,lloeki,,,"The point I was making was with regard to the article, which goes down on Django because it would supposedly not be barebones enough. I was expliciting that although one does an apparently monolithic <i>(easy_install|pip install) django</i>, one can readily use only the project+url+view part and have something as barebones as Flask in which you could use other components. Additionally you could readily use only Django templates or the Django ORM, and use e.g Flask for the view part (or no view part at all if you're not doing web stuff)<p>As for the comparison with Rails, faking models is the same in Django, as both leverage duck-typing features of their underlying language. In Django, a model is just a class, and many things are just queried via introspection. Many parts just query <i>model_instance.pk</i>. Additionally populating Model.meta and you even get yourself some deeper model introspection features. To me the true important part of ActiveRecord, ActiveModel and ActiveSupport is rather that you have a set of modules that you can readily include/extend into your fake models to inject complete model behavior, and that is something Django lacks.<p>You name the example of link helpers, and interestingly this is an example of the difference of philosophy between Rails and Django (see [0]). Django parts are coupled more loosely than Rails parts, a possible rationale being that creating coupling between two distant parts such as URLs and models could enforce constraints on each, thus reducing their potential to independently shine and coercing possible alternatives of each to the provided model. Another example: with Django you explicitly create a request object (whether directly constructed or encapsulated into a helper method) to be returned by the view function while Rails does magic for you in the controller.<p>Interestingly you bring the problem of forms and this is again an area where Rails and Django differ. Rails wants both form and data to be handled by a single model, whereas Django separates form models and data models. The rationale here is that they are two different problems and that they ought to be solved by two different components (yet they share a great deal of similarity, and code).<p>FWIW I worked extensively with both (although my current job is in a Ruby shop, I worked with Django at my previous job and since I'm more of a Python guy I keep myself up to date on that front too), and am in no way saying that one is better than the other.

Who will finish the race first?<p>The great sailor, of course.<p>Now, same experiment, except the weak sailor now gets a 1000 km/hr wind and the great one gets a 1 km/hr wind (hypothetically of course). Who wins the race now?<p>The weak sailor.<p>Now, who was responsible for winning the race? Was it the wind or was it the person who captured the wind? What's more important - the person who captures, or the gust that fills his sail? Replace sail with society and sailor with founder (adjust for time/economy/education/family). Now who's responsible for the success of the company? Was it the single factor person? Or the inumerable factor society?<p>What's more likely - that people are special (you're all special - just like mother told you), or that the situations they are placed in are? Are there really great men (or women), or are there in fact merely extraordinary situations that produce, as a side effect, those self-same ""great"" men/women?<p>Why do inventions have multiple origins, why are there always multiple companies in the same spaces being founded at the same time, why does innovation happen in specific situations rather than with specific groups of people? There were hundreds of search engines/social networks. The telephone was patented on the same day by multiple people. The radio has one of the most messy histories of invention I have ever seen.<p>""Founder as Victim, Founder as God"" sounds a great deal like  humans have a poor understanding of randomness. 15% of Fortune 500 CEOs are replaced every single year. Why is that? Maybe it's because people don't understand randomness and the astounding complexity inherent in large systems (the Earth for example).<p><i>Replace the CEO - that'll fix all our problems! Change strategy, that did it! We just need more synergy, better management, great leadership!</i><p>Let's ignore global macro factors like extraneous lowering of energy/technology costs, the economic cycle, geopolitical risk, time between war, sex, age, race, strong laws, strong defence, personal networks, position in society, number of humans alive, access to education, access to capital, actions of third parties, chance meetings and all the other things that go into these systems.<p><pre><code>  Yeah, the founders, that's who's important!
</code></pre>
Just wave away everything else - we do love our narratives don't we (imagine life without films!).<p><i>This is fundamental attribution error at work.</i> The world is more complex than the people in it. CEOs don't cause great companies as much as you'd like that to be true. People don't cause great things to happen as much as people want that to be true. The world is very complex and humans are incredibly stupid.<p>Most people have trouble getting their heads around controlled static experiments in physics/AI. That's a tiny, tiny system. It takes a great deal of arrogance to talk of the world in such a generalized, grandiose way, without a shred of evidence apart from personal biases and inductive reasoning.<p><pre><code>  The plural of anecdote is not data.

Some newer devices showed the non-2^n-px texture (500x500) without problems, but older did not display anything.

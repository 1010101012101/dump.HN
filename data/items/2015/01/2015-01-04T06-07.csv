Hope this helps.<p>They are all separate parts, and you can do them in any order you want.<p>I like to think of the language as two parts - syntax and features.  How do I want the language to look and what features do I want the language to have?  The parser and lexer handle the syntax, and the AST handles the features.<p>This way, I can play around with the syntax of the language a little later.<p>I would start with a really simple language:<p>- add expressions, proper infix support for arithmetic<p>- variables<p>- if / else / else if<p>- scoping / functions<p>- loops if you don&#x27;t want to just use recursion<p>then, you can get more advanced:<p>- lambda expressions / first class functions / closures<p>- namespaces or types<p>- macros.  if you can make nice looking lisp-style macros for an infix language i would love you<p>write it as an interpreter, add an llvm backend.<p>It should be fun.  do a little at a time.",1420354564

8833645,comment,8831667,8831667,0,0,choppaface,,,"Could not agree more: &quot;the practice of equity administration is systemically biased against employees&quot; (and to protect companies and investors).  Equity admin isn&#x27;t just a mess for startups but can be a mess for mature companies, too.  If you have a chance to interview a manager before accepting an offer, I highly recommend asking them how well Finance has their shit together.  You don&#x27;t want to, say, get in a fight with the General Counsel over stock...<p>I had major stock admin issues at a fairly mature (then 6-year-old) company that is now public.  Soon after I started, my boss promised me a follow-on stock award for good performance but failed to do any of the paperwork.  I only discovered this issue when I later requested HR to audit my paperwork, and I ended up having to fight our General Council (who was also on the board) for an ENTIRE QUARTER over this mess.  The GC not only badgered me but completely mislead me and had the board change my grant without my signature on the final agreement in order save his face (and likely the company from running into trouble with pre-IPO auditors).  It took a ton of painful arguments with my boss (and revelations that he had other &#x27;broken&#x27; stock promises) to finally get that stock re-awarded.  To save HIS face he ended up giving a bunch of my colleagues pre-IPO stock bonuses too (though some had that &#x27;fuck-off&#x27; back-weighted 10/20/30/40 vesting).  The whole process unfortunately obliterated the trust in the relationship and made /vesting/ the (mostly) restored stock very, very painful.<p>If the law, regulations, and administration were a lot more straightforward, I doubt any of this would have ever happened. (Well, if my boss and the General Council would have owned up to their mistakes, that would have helped, too :) .  Something like eShares might have also enabled my company to let non-management employees do 83(b)s leading up to what turned out to be a highly successful IPO.<p>eShares is nice, but some sort of basic, open-source and free baby gate would be a huge help, too.  When managers have so much control over employee compensation, it&#x27;s really easy for them to fuck things up (intentionally or not).",1420354340
8833644,comment,8831688,8831688,0,0,A1kmm,,,"The person who gets to decide how to break down policy into binary decisions and when to ask questions is the one with all the power here.<p>Suppose they want to suppress a 49% minority who care far more than the 51% majority and will pay far more. Assume that if the question (e.g. do you support gay marriage) was asked once, the minority could afford the votes for it to pass. If the person deciding what questions are asked wants to suppress this, they simply formulate the policy so that for the minority to get what they want, they have to answer &#x27;No&#x27; to n binary questions (e.g. each of the n questions is a measure that bans gay marriage in a slightly different way). The minority can afford to overcome the majority on one question, but for some n, they can&#x27;t afford to defeat the majority repeatedly. Therefore, asking the same question more than once would change the outcome.<p>Bundling decisions would also allow manipulation of binary preferences - for example, by mixing popular and unpopular measures (e.g. cutting taxes and re-establishing slavery) in a single decision so that just enough people considered it worth supporting, even though they don&#x27;t support all line items.<p>The mechanism is therefore useless as a voting mechanism without some way of controlling how things get on the ballot.<p>Of course, the bigger issue (assuming, as the paper does, that a real currency is used and not an artificial one) is that the laws in place are never perfect, and measuring how much influence a group should have to make new laws based on how wealthy became under current laws will likely lead to dynamic evolution towards a solution that benefits a tiny minority.<p>For example, suppose we live in a fictional world where the currency is apples with 100 people. A person needs 1 apple a day to live (which is consumed, destroying it). The world has enough trees to produce 125 apples a day (and no more land to plant more trees). Due to an archaic and unfair law, people numbered 0-49 get 1.5 apples a day, while everyone else gets 1 apple a day. People 50-99 perform services to people 0-49 and get a little bit of extra apple in exchange. People 50-99 never vote, because they can&#x27;t afford it (or if they do, it is the minimum - they always vote for everyone to get 1.25 apples per day), while people 0-49 put forward a bit over the minimum and easily win to retain the archaic law.<p>One day, people 0-48 decide they want more apples, so they propose to change the law so that person 49 gets only 1 apple per day. Person 49 puts in all their savings, but it is not enough, and the law is changed. Person 49 is now impoverished and in the same state as people 49-99. Gradually, this continues until one or two people have virtually all the superfluous apples - and everyone else even has to work hard for that small group of people to get even the one apple they need to survive.",1420354329

8833627,comment,8830930,8832884,0,0,enoch_r,,,"> One must of course speak in generalities but it seems obvious they have at least one goal in common: to remain wealthy & empowered, come what may. Which of course has implications for which public policies succeed and which fail.<p>The self-interested voter hypothesis has been examined empirically quite a bit and the lack of evidence for it is pretty surprising. To avoid the risk of cherry-picking, let&#x27;s look at a few papers that support your assertion, and look at how <i>they</i> describe the literature.<p>In the first paper, &quot;Caught in the Draft: Vietnam Draft Lottery Status and Political Attitudes,&quot;[1] the authors found that eligibility for the Vietnam draft had a significant and quite strong effect on political opinions. Here&#x27;s how the authors describe previous research on self-interest and public opinion:<p>> Self-interest effects have been notoriously elusive in public opinion research. [...] &quot;Longino (1973) found more negative attitudes toward the war among those with low lottery numbers, but not to a statistically significant extent (reaffirmed by Bergen’s (2009) reanalysis), while Aspler (1972) found more disapproval of the draft. Yet,civilian attitudes toward (or related to) the war in Vietnam have been shown to be at best weakly related to self-interest indicators whether one has a family member or friend serving in Vietnam (Lau, Brown,and Sears 1978, Mueller 1973). Indeed, Lau, Brown, and Sears (1978) find “no evidence that the self-interested had distinctly self-serving attitudes toward the war” (p.479).<p>Here&#x27;s another paper, titled &quot;A Reconsideration of Self-Interest in American Public Opinion,&quot;[2] let&#x27;s quote their introduction:<p>> A fairly extensive body of research has investigated the weight that self-interested concerns carry in defining the opinions that citizens come to adopt (e.g. Bobo and Kluegel 1993; Feldman 1982; Green and Gerkin 1989; Kinder and Kiewiet 1981; Lau, Brown, and Sears 1978; Sears, Hensler, and Speer 1979; Sears, Lau, Tyler, and Allen 1980; Sears and Citrin 1982; Sears, Huddy, and Shaffer 1986; Tyler 1990). Over and over in these studies the same conclusion emerges: the evidence for self-interest effects is, in most cases, weak at best. In an early review of this literature Lau and his colleagues concluded that &quot;[i]n all these cases, self-interest, defined in terms of real or potential impact of a policy issue upon the individual&#x27;s personal life, had only minor effects on policy attitudes and upon behavior connected with them&quot; (Lau, Brown, and Sears 1978, 479). More recent reviews have reached similar judgments (e.g. Citrin and Green 1990; Kinder and Sears 1983; Sears and Funk 1990).<p>They buck the trend of looking at <i>material self-interest</i> to look instead at subjective self-interest--&quot;asking respondents to indicate whether the policy would have (national health care, school funding) or has had (affirmative action) either positive or negative consequences for themselves personally,&quot; and find a strong effect on opinion. (Given what we know about the human tendency to deny <i>all</i> costs of a favored policy, or deny <i>all</i> benefits of an unfavored policy, I fear that this is a pretty thorny definition of self-interest.)<p>A third paper, &quot;Self-Interest and Public Opinion Towards Smoking Restrictions and Cigarette Taxes,&quot;[3] finds that nonsmokers are &quot;far more enthusiastic about tightening smoking restrictions and increasing cigarette taxes than smokers, particularly heavy smokers.&quot; Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find an ungated version, but here&#x27;s their abstract:<p>> A burgeoning literature suggests that self-interest has little influence on policy preferences. In sharp contrast are the findings discussed in this paper. [...] We conclude by discussing several explanations for the apparent discrepancy between these results and the pattern of null findings characteristic of the self-interest literature.<p>So, three papers, all of which support your claim that political opinions are self-interested. To describe the existing evidence, they use words like &quot;notoriously elusive,&quot; &quot;weak at best,&quot; and &quot;pattern of null findings.&quot; You can look through the literature yourself but what &quot;seems obvious&quot; has been studied quite a bit, and the evidence that our intuition is correct has been surprisingly sparse.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.columbia.edu/~rse14/vietnam_rev_Feb2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbia.edu/~rse14/vietnam_rev_Feb2010.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.electionstudies.org/resources/papers/documents/nes010876.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.electionstudies.org/resources/papers/documents/ne...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/1.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/1.short</a>",1420353829

8833623,comment,8831689,8833035,0,0,barrkel,,,"A hand-written lexer should beat most table-based lexers. Hand-written lexers encode the automaton state in the program counter and encode the transitions in code branches, whereas table-based need to use a separate variable and encode the transitions through an indirection followed by a loop.<p>Parsers are a different kettle of fish entirely though. You hypothetically compare a handwritten parser with a &quot;fast&quot; generated parser. Presumably a handwritten parser will be faster than a &quot;slow&quot; generated parser?<p>If the language to be parsed is simple and has no ambiguities that need semantic information to resolve (this is not the case for C, for example, never mind C++), a generated parser may save time. Would it be faster than a handwritten parser? I have my doubts, for similar reasons as lexers. The automaton state is stored implicitly via the program counter, and state transitions are in code: similar arguments apply. If the handwritten parser is doing more busywork, such as a lot of recursion to handle precedence in expressions, then it may be slower. But if it uses precedence parsing just for operators, it can get that back, while not losing the benefits of recursive descent style.<p>OTOH, if you&#x27;re trying to parse a fairly ambiguous language, you can save a substantial amount of effort with a parallelized LR parser, something that builds a forest of parse trees and discards options that are no longer feasible when more information comes in: a Tomita or GLR parser. Parsing such languages with recursive descent typically involves a lot of extra work building up semantic info as you go, or parsing a simpler form of the language and rewriting with disambiguation later, after further analysis. But GLR parsing is O(n^3) in the worst case. Hand-written may be a lot more work, but it might also be faster. It depends.",1420353741

I didn&#x27;t repeat the experiment for that issue, but the next time I had to get Apple support, the response was astounding as well.[1] I don&#x27;t place much faith in the Genius Bar, and it is far from blind Apple-bashing in my case.<p>> But your anecdote doesn&#x27;t address my point: Do you think any combination of laptop brand and linux distro would be more likely to have everything work out of the box than Apple hardware running OS X?<p>Well, yes, but you aren&#x27;t going to like it. If you want a &quot;brand&quot; recommendation, Thinkpads are still your best bet. I&#x27;ve seen you&#x27;re hit by that brightness bug, and that really does suck, but... &quot;such problems are quite rare compared to the average Linux on Thinkpad experience&quot; :/ I got a refurb X220 from ebay and put 14.04 on it - everything worked, down to the fingerprint reader. Go for a specific model rather than a brand, as &quot;Our Milages Do Vary&quot; even within brands.<p>As for the out-of-the-box experience, for my personal use case (hacker/developer) I don&#x27;t value it that much. I&#x27;d much rather tweak a bit, but then have a system that &quot;won&#x27;t betray me&quot;, than have something that works 90% of the way I&#x27;d want it to, out of the box, and occasionally crash and fail me in mysterious undiagnosable ways. OS X wasn&#x27;t even at 90% for me - &quot;Always on Top&quot; available out of the box nowadays? I had Afloat for this (and transparencies) in 10.6, but it didn&#x27;t work for 10.7+<p>For the out-of-the-box experience in a casual user&#x27;s use case, I have another anecdote for you - my distinctly non-technical mother. After seemingly making a hobby out of infecting her Windows XP/Vista over the years, I had this crazy idea to try Linux Mint on her crapware HP 17&quot; laptop. I won&#x27;t lie to you, I <i>did</i> hold my breath a bit while installing, hoping that I&#x27;ll manage to sort out the inevitable issues, and I was surprised to find no issues at all. Everything worked out of the box and she&#x27;s still using it, over a year later, with no complaints or need for technical support from me. She&#x27;s a casual user - browsing, email, flash game or two - and she didn&#x27;t really need Windows that much after all.<p>Finally, just like OS X works well with specific hardware, Linux is sort-of the same. If all vendors bothered with Linux support, the situation would be different and you&#x27;d have much greater chances of &quot;Just Works&quot; - but alas, that isn&#x27;t so. If you can pick your laptop to be compatible, you won&#x27;t have issues 99% of the time. Occasionally, vendors lie/exaggerate about the extent of Linux support (grep for &quot;XPS 13&quot; for my rant elsewhere on this thread about Dell), so <i>always double-check</i> on wikis/forums/issue trackers (Arch wiki is a goldmine, even if you go with another distro). It sucks a little, that you have to go by specific model, but not that much, really.<p>Right now I&#x27;d pick a T or X series Thinkpad, with Ubuntu base for power users (and a strong recommendation to research other window managers) or Mint 17 base for average users.<p>[1] My second, and final data point with the Genius Bar (UK/Oxford Str - in case it matters): Took in my girlfriend&#x27;s Macbook, under warranty, for some obvious hardware issues (disk not detected intermittently? instability issues? I can&#x27;t recall exactly but it screamed hardware). I know this sounds like I&#x27;m making it up, but initially they told me that the issue was limited free disk space (5G/500G) and only accepted to take a deeper look at it after some stern comments from yours truly. I kid you not: not enough free disk space. Anyway, the motherboard was faulty and was replaced. And - miracle of miracles! - it worked even with the measly 5G free disk space >:[",1420353452

You must master the syntax, the grammar, the idiosyncrasies, the rules and unwritten and written customs, and the is-isms of the language before you can &quot;effortlessly&quot; write code in a given platform/language. This is one of the reasons beginners to programming may stumble on the hike - they are so focused on the writing of the lines of code that they are often pushed by themselves or their otherwise well-intentioned teacher to produce code. The building blocks of code are not the lines of code - it is the concepts and the system and framework and mental model behind it (the whiteboard so to speak).<p>&quot;This year, forget about the year as a whole.

We must practice and strengthen this conviction daily. We may even have to go outside of music to do it. This is really important, because playing, being so addictive, pulls us easily from the true goal and draws us back into more mundane realms.<p>But when you have made the inner connection, playing becomes more like taking dictation from within. Work with the thought, <i>I am the master, I am great.</i> Then just put your hands on the instrument, trust them, and eventually it will be so.<p>&quot;<i>Do not fear mistakes.

No, a programmer would call any object in Java an &quot;object.&quot;  I get that the point is to say that a struct does not make an object, but the point seemed overstated in that case.<p>3.  Objects must have &quot;recognizable identity,&quot; but you don&#x27;t have to be able to compare the identity of two objects (really it should say two object values or two references).  &quot;Recognizing&quot; is being used in a very abstract way here, to avoid invoking state to explain the potential difference between objects.  I think it&#x27;s a little too subtle, even if the point is elaborated on later.  If you have any other way to articulate what gives objects identity even if you can&#x27;t detect it directly, I think it would help.  To most readers, I think &quot;recognizing&quot; identity would mean being able to check whether you have a reference to a given object or not, which means being able to compare references.

Presumably if you&#x27;re the kind of person who wants QV, you regard the current method as insufficient or inefficient or both.  (Personally, I think that QV is interesting, but I don&#x27;t ultimately favor it).<p>Again, though, you&#x27;re kind of weirdly trying to talk about situations with impassioned majorities.  They already win.  If they really want to pay extra to win by tons more, well, they&#x27;re wasting their money.<p>If your ultimate point is that quadratic functions don&#x27;t increase fast enough (&quot;the wealthy have exponentially more wealth&quot;), then just choose a faster-increasing function.  As I pointed out in another sub-thread, 2^n means that the 20th extra vote you buy would cost 1,000,000 times as much as the first extra vote you buy, and the 100th vote you buy would cost more money than anyone has ever or will ever have.  That should pretty solidly allay concerns that the top 5% or top 1% will ever buy a majority that way, while still leaving open some interesting things that happen with a minority of 20% or higher.  (Personally, I doubt that an exponential function would be necessary, though a polynomial function of higher order than quadratic might).",1420351534

(Disclaimer: I say this as a person where I&#x27;m currently surrounded by two iMac&#x27;s, a macbook pro, and an iphone, so I&#x27;m not exactly a hater).<p>The weird thing is I don&#x27;t even know what they&#x27;re going for.<p>There are two trends I&#x27;ve seen:<p>1) Be more like iOS (for example, the dumb reverse scroll (wait sorry, &quot;natural&quot; scroll&quot;) and removing things like UI elements reacting to hovering.) I have no idea what&#x27;s even clickable anymore. That&#x27;s idiotic. I get consistency, but you shouldn&#x27;t kick one platform in the knees to replicate the shortcomings of another. OK so touch screens don&#x27;t have hover. Still, I&#x27;d like to have that back on the desktop. It&#x27;d be nice to know what&#x27;s actually clickable.<p>2) Being more &quot;social&quot;. Like now all my OSX devices want to be connected to my phone, and tell me about every goddamn text message. And if I try to ignore this, I get berated by annoying login screens. &quot;Cancel&quot;. Hey maybe you want to see that screen again! NO! fuck off! I have no interest in iCloud, stop asking me five times to log in. Apple seems hell bent into annoying you into signing up for a lot of privacy degrading services.<p>Not only that, but they just choose bizarre fucking defaults. Like, if I sync my iPhone, it will pop up iPhoto automatically with all my recent photos. Jesus christ. On the plus side, I&#x27;m boring, so there&#x27;s nothing really there, but who the hell thought that was a good idea?!? Does apple have any idea what people actually use cell phone cameras for?

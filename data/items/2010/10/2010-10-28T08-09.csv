Also, once you do take location into account, you have to remember that the cost of living in that area is likely much different. Supply and demand for the region also plays a big key.<p>In many cases, employers use these guides to gauge what they will tell you what ""market rate"" is, and a lot of shady employers will stiff everyone in the company. They might even tell you that you are at the high end of the pay scale at the company, which might be true since they're stiffing everyone.<p>Just don't use this as true self worth indicators, as chances are your category is likely lowballed.",1288256381

1842242,comment,1839022,1839022,0,0,alanh,,,"I’m about to go to sleep, but I just want to drop a few of my favorite rules of thumb. (I love UX and constantly bitch about bad interfaces, FWIW.)<p>- Visual hierarchies.  Color theory.  Understand both of these, and use them.<p>- Don’t use the words “me” or “my” in your interfaces (with rare exceptions like “✓ remember me”, which is <i>de-facto</i> standardized)<p>- Native controls/widgets give users lots of free platform-specific and accessibility functionality that they expect. Don’t implement your own text box / dropdown / scrollbars without a damn good reason.<p>- Use color sparingly, to convey meaning and/or draw attention.<p>- What is the purpose of each and every design element? Can it be removed, or does it have no purpose? Then remove it. (Maybe keeping one exception to the rule gives your site a touch of personality / a brand).<p>- Reading the OS X HIG is eye-opening. Don’t try to follow it <i>online,</i> though!<p>- Can stuff line up? It probably should.<p>- When should you show a throbber or “Loading…” message? The answer is <i>not</i> “whenever something is loading”.  It’s “whenever the user <i>must</i> wait for something to load, or whenever an update or change of view as a result of a direct user action is not immediately visible.”  And this should be minimized.<p>- Don’t half-ass buttons.  If they hover or have an active (depressed) state, then the hover (“over”) state should look like a slightly lighter or darker version of the normal (“up”) state; the depressed (“down”) state should look physically depressed, if applicable; invert the gradient, swap the borders, or whatever.<p>It looks like I’m starting to list pet peeves instead of the big ones, so good night!",1288256137

1842239,comment,1841692,1841692,0,0,jayphelps,,,"I seem to binge code often. Usually that means I'll go for 2-4 months with 2-3 hours of sleep, coding until the sun comes up.  Now, I'm not super-human. It takes a toll certainly. During these binges I'll crash for a good 8 hrs every week or so to catch up.<p>I feel surprisingly okay during these periods, but it doesn't last forever. Eventually my day time performance starts to slow and then I go back to a normal routine where I still code almost non-stop except I sleep for 4-7 hrs depending. It isn't out of necessity, it's out of enjoyment, which is probably why I can get away with it.<p>(obviously, I eat, shower, and do take short breaks which usually means Wikipedia, blogs, and such)<p>This isn't for everyone. I'm sure its very unhealthy and I have no doubt I won't be able to continue this pattern when I'm older, but it's gotten me some incredibly productive work done. It's so much easier to stay focused FOR ME if I work on something in one sitting then to break it up. Some people are more productive sleeping 8hrs a day...but I'm not one of them. It's hard to sleep that long for me and I end up feeling like I slept all day.<p>It's so hard not to binge when there's always something to learn!<p>Lastly, like most on here I grew up from a very early age sitting at my computer.

Do you have any tips (books?) on getting up to speed with modern electronic components? I've got the very basic stuff down: I studied physics (i.e. I know Ohm, Kirchhoff, capacitors, semiconductors, AC circuits, etc. on a fundamental level) and tinkered with electronics as a kid; building simple circuits with OpAmps, 555s or basic logic gate ICs is as far as my knowledge goes. Beyond that I've been using pre-assembled microprocessor devkits which have all the ports and boot-up infrastructure ready to go. The software side is no problem for me. The gap is everything in between though, things like how I'd go about adding extra ADCs and DACs or external digital I/O that's electrically isolated to protect the processor (optocouplers? which one? etc.).",1288255735

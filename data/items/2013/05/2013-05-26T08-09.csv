I've been thinking this weekend about how I might take advantage of proper components at $work.<p>The best I can relate it, is that I can take all the widgets that are used throughout the website and wrap them up into their own CSS and JS. No need for rigorous CSS namespacing, JS modules, etc. It's all packaged up, ready to drop into an HTML page. The most interesting part are the polyfills for the various Web Components, erm components, that are currently being drafted. At the moment, the polyfills have to implement most everything but eventually won't be needed when the specs are finalised and the browsers caught up.",1369558785
5770544,comment,5764732,5767885,1,0,AlexDanger,,,"<i>adverts fascinate me as a study of society</i><p>Thats a nice perspective, I might try that. The science of advertising is also interesting - these marketers spent squillions of research dollars on figuring out the most effective technique to transfer an idea/emotion/brand (essentially a meme) to your brain. Those techniques are also applicable to giving a presentation for work and public speaking. I've noticed the most successful people in the workplace are those who can 'sell' their ideas to their colleagues and managers.<p><i>But are TV adverts really more ""mentally polluting"" than a 80s song or a limerick you picked up at a schoolyard?</i><p>For the most case I think you're right. There is a subset of more evil adverts which attempt to play on insecurities  (body image, gender roles/responsibilities, medical fearmonging). But most advertising is just...transient noise. Never attribute to malice what can be explained by banality.<p>I have a pet theory that our brains will retain a certain amount of useless 'mental pollution' regardless of what information streams are being thrown at it. Not because we need those little nuggets of useless information, but because they are implicit to the formation and recall of other 'useful' memories and emotions. Memory is a multi-sensory thing, regardless of what part of the memory is 'useful'.<p>Music is a special case, its ability to trigger episodic memories is very strong[1]. I like to think of it in computer science terms as a hash table[2]. If you spend enough time doing a certain thing whilst listening to the same music, the event is stored against the hash (music). Then in the future, listening to this music will trigger a <i>very</i> strong memory of that time in your life.<p>I spent many hours as a teenager listening to music whilst playing video games. Now if I listen to these albums, the memories instantly 'come flooding back' as the saying goes.<p>[1]I believe olfactory triggers are stronger than auditory triggers. Perhaps smell-o-vision advertising is the next big thing.<p>[2] Not a great analogy - the linking and recall is really bidirectional.",1369558770

</code></pre>
That's probably a difference of perspective, or opinion. In a way - and in my perception - an embargo towards a country is a form of sabotage. No need to nitpick this point, though.<p>While the reason for the embargo is well documented and quite understandable. The main reason why it's going on for so long is probably the massive and unproportionally large influence of the Cuban exile community. A lot of them pretty unsavory types.<p>Also, while I don't want to defend the Castros it should be noted that Batista, his predecessor who came into this role by a coup (he was elected president in the 40s, but would'nt stand a chance to be re-elected, so he putshed) was not a friend of the people and that the revolution had huge popular support.<p>In any case: thanks for the links. I don't really care if an argument comes from the left, or the right as long it's well layed out and soundly reasoned. As a matter of fact I read a few quite good papers and essays by the Cato Institute, even though we're certainly not on the same page politically (it yet needs to be seen where they move to, when the Kochs succeed with their takeover, though).<p>Cheers, interesting discussion.",1369558184

I can calculate this by solving some equation, but its expensive. If I wanted to apply some machine learning to the problem some form of regression would work if I stuck to a fixed size (some number of atoms in a particular coordinate system).<p>More concretely, if I had energy as a function of two atoms, I could fit some function through the points and get something halfway reasonable.<p>However, if I want to have three atoms, I have no idea how to treat it. The learning algorithm has no idea about ""atoms"" or that their energies might be composable in some way.<p>What sort of machine learning could figure out and learn the underlying rules of physics and ""understand"" how energy should change as a function of the positions of the atoms and the underlying physics rules that must be preserved. One of these rules is that the energy must go to a constant (possibly zero depending on the energy is defined) if you separate the atoms infinitely far apart and must go to infinity if the distance is zero. Also the function must be smooth with continuous derivatives.<p>I haven't made my point very well, but perhaps someone would know what literature to read about unsupervised learning algorithms that could ""learn"" physics.",1369558123

I told the man, ""I'm sorry, but I would like to continue as a professor at Cornell University.""<p>What had happened was, during the war, at Los Alamos, there was a very nice fella in charge of the patent office for the government, named Captain Smith. Smith sent around a notice to everybody that said something like, ""We in the patent office would like to patent every idea you have for the United States government, for which you are working now. Any idea you have on nuclear energy or its application that you may think everybody knows about, everybody doesn't know about: Just come to my office and tell me the idea.""<p>I see Smith at lunch, and as we're walking back to the technical area, I say to him, ""That note you sent around: That's kind of crazy to have us come in and tell you every idea.""<p>We discussed it back and forth--by this time we're in his office-and I say, ""There are so many ideas about nuclear energy that are so perfectly obvious, that I'd be here all day telling you stuff.""<p>""LIKE WHAT?""<p>""Nothin' to it!"" I say. ""Example: nuclear reactor . . . under water. . water goes in . . . steam goes out the other side ... Pshshshsht--it's a submarine. Or: nuclear reactor ... air comes rushing in the front... heated up by nuclear reaction ... out the back it goes ... Boom! Through the air-
-it's an airplane. Or: nuclear reactor ... you have hydrogen go through the thing ... Zoom!--it's a rocket. Or: nuclear reactor ... only instead of using ordinary uranium, you use enriched uranium with beryllium oxide at high temperature to make it more efficient ... It's an electrical power plant. 
There's a million ideas!"" I said, as I went out the door.
Nothing happened.<p>About three months later, Smith calls me in the office and says, ""Feynman, the submarine has already been taken. But the other three are yours.""<p>So when the guys at the airplane company in California are planning their laboratory, and try to find out who's an expert in rocket-propelled whatnots, there's nothing to it: They look at who's got the patent on it!<p><a href=""http://www.chem.fsu.edu/chemlab/isc3523c/feyn_surely.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chem.fsu.edu/chemlab/isc3523c/feyn_surely.pdf</a>",1369557063

I am not saying it's not true. There are certainly places such as StackOverflow, mailing lists etc that attract newbies early on because they provide quick answers or even code, but at some point every developer who is serious about computer programming as a long term profession does need to start reading the docs. There is no other alternative and one eventually comes to realize that it's much faster than arbitrarily hunting for code and asking questions on mailing lists and IRC.<p>It also depends upon the style of programming language (imperative/functional) and the previous experience of the developer IMO. For eg. I find my self reading the docs significantly more in Erlang/Scala than in Python than in PHP/JS. It is also the reverse order in which I learnt these languages.

A lot of this is to just get used to asking for more, rather than just taking what you are offered.<p>But it's also important to remember where your focus really is, and to not go too far down the marketing rabbit hole;  at least in my experience, the ROI on effort in that direction drops pretty fast once you get past that initial low-hanging fruit, just due to my lack of innate ability, and at least for me, it quickly starts looking like deception.   Really, much of sales looks like fraud to me, so I go out of my way to avoid those parts of sales.   No sense in playing close to the line when I can't see the line.  But, one can aggressive while still being transparent and honest, and while it does bother me that being aggressive gets me more money, it's something I can live with for more money.",1369555572

Sadly for Macs the only option is some kind of external USB token :(  I kind of wish someone made a bluetooth 4.0 le device which could hold keys and be used as a smartcard/key device, maybe with trusted user I/O too.

Most programming is done as a craft in businesses, with business needs that reward turn around time and coming in under budget more than ruggedness, or real maintainability.<p>In a more corporate environment, it tends to favor the use of ""Architecture"" roles, and the use of many different design patterns even when they are not necessary and only add complexity in the name of ""consistency"" with other ""enterprise"" implementations.<p>Just the same, most software development is a model of crafting, not engineering.  The exceptions to this tend to be with designing software that works with physical devices for a given role, not generic computing devices that are virtual representations of business logic.",1369555392

The matrix is something like this:<p><pre><code>    Inflation| Buyer | Seller |\n    ---------+-------+--------+\n       Early | Win   |  Lose  |\n    ---------+-------+--------+\n       Later | Lose  |  Win   |\n    ---------+-------+--------+\n\n    Deflation| Buyer | Seller |\n    ---------+-------+--------+\n       Early | Lose  |  Win   |\n    ---------+-------+--------+\n       Later | Win   |  Lose  |\n    ---------+-------+--------+\n</code></pre>\nUltimately, neither one is good. In the case of moderate deflation and inflation it&#x27;s similar. There is less motivation to invest, greater motivation to save under moderate deflation. Moderate inflation increases the motivation to invest, but decreases the motivation to save.",1385585988

I think it&#x27;s to make our languages and character sets less complicated. I can&#x27;t believe that multiple codepoints being used to generate a single glyph made it into the Unicode spec.

The spirit of the second amendment is to allow the citizenry to violently overthrow the federal government if they become too powerful, as a last-resort measure. The weapons that the colonists were fighting against were 3 rounds per minute muskets and single-shot cannons, not Apache attack helicopters. Is there a really a regulatory framework that could conceivably exist that would allow for ordinary, private citizens to overthrow the full might of the US military while protecting society from wanton gun violence?",1385585952

Also, everything about the critique presented doesn&#x27;t have to be false for the successes that bitcoin has had to be real. I think that bitcoin really serves as a form of regulatory arbitrage... its real value, the value that people are placing on it, represent gains that can be made by avoiding fees and oversight.

So it&#x27;s <i>we humans who mostly choose to hold the phone in portrait orientation.</i>  There&#x27;s no single answer, but I&#x27;ll offer pointers:<p>- Ergonomics. It&#x27;s generally easier to hold and handle a smartphone one-handed in portrait.<p>- Readability. Speaking personally, it&#x27;s mostly annoying to have wide text lines and a short display height.  The exclusive reason I use landscape on the mobile web is when the site doesn&#x27;t handle mobile and the text is just too small even on a high PPI display.

But if you give them reins to design the system, they will inevitably want you to build them something Drupal like. In my experience, I&#x27;ve found that all these different content-relations end up being unused, and the client ends up hacking around them just to get a simple post up.",1385585318

It&#x27;s reached a point where if a government tries to regulate it too tightly, they will effectively be shooting themselves in the foot and cutting their country off from outside trade.<p>The result is that the cryptocurrency will continue to gain momentum until it is used everywhere worldwide. This will eventually lead to a single worldwide government or an agreement between all countries across the world to act uniformly in regards to the currency. This will become a necessity to properly administer taxes and/or settle cross-border contract disputes.<p>Once you have a single government, worldwide government ids will be initiated (or all local ids, like driver&#x27;s licenses will require integration with a wordwide database). At this point, the single government will then co-opt the cryptocurrency or initiate a new cryptocurrency and require everybody to tie their id to their cryptocurrency usage. The reasoning will be to crack down on crime, tax evaders, etc. Because it&#x27;s a one world government or all governments are working together in lock-step, they would then have the capability of controlling/banning the cryptocurrency. Anyone not properly linking their identity to the currency will be breaking the law, and it will be very difficult to participate in commerce because there will be no more physical cash or coins.<p>Either way, the only way I see this playing out is a currency that most people assume was initially intended to break from government control will eventually lead to ultimate government control.<p>As a side note, I realize the concept of a one world government is controversial, but my personal opinion is that it is an eventuality.",1385585143

The point of a progressive tax system is that the marginal impact is greater at higher income levels.<p>Marginal impact is greater.  Using the numbers I listed above your marginal tax rate at a income of $10k/year is NEGATIVE 100%, at an income of $100k/year it would be 0%, at $500k/year it would be 8%, at $1m/year it would be 9%... asymptotic increasing towards 10%.<p>> ...there is always a positive incentive to higher income<p>Sorry, you are correct.  I should have said there is increased income doesn&#x27;t increase disincentives.<p>> Only if the flat rate is set very high compared to the existing rates paid by most of the population.<p>The point wasn&#x27;t being made on total net revenue but on cost per dollar collected due to compliance enforcement and bureaucratic overhead.  Regardless the flat tax rate CAN be set very high as long as there is a corresponding offset in the MBI.  Ultimately the ACTUAL rate people pay could be similar to the amount they currently pay but normalized over the population as a whole.<p>> If this includes taxing capital gains as income<p>> To do this, government has to alter the definition of taxable income<p>Which is why I specifically mentioned ALL income.<p>> This does not eliminate their ability to make similar decisions in the future<p>This is very true, and probably the strongest argument you made in your post.

You might need to write accessors, iteration, transversal, searches, serialisation, merging, and a whole bunch of other things you get for free with a data structure. Encapsulation means continually re-implementing the wheel, which takes time.<p>Another huge problem with encapsulation is that you lose transparency and constraints. If I have a system represented fully or in part by a data structure, it gives me visibility and certain guarantees. For example, if I set a key in a map to a value, I know that when I read that key I&#x27;ll get the same value out. You have no such guarantees with objects.<p>Encapsulation trades <i></i>possible<i></i> gains for <i></i>certain<i></i> losses. This might be acceptable, if you had some reason to believe you stood to gain a lot more than you&#x27;d lose. But there&#x27;s no empirical evidence to suggest that there are any significant gains in practice from encapsulation.

That since it is money not backed by the, hopefully, benevolent will of a state it will be subject to the whims of market makers or the panic of the crowd. I think the author of the article is quite correct in making this point.<p>History has repeatedly shown that the mercy of the state is better than the chaos of the market, at least over the long term. Yes, every once in a while the state will take away a punch bowl that it didn&#x27;t need to take away, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that their overall goals aren&#x27;t worthwhile. More rarely the state clamps down too hard, but history shows that in these instances the market&#x27;s ability to correct an overbearing state has greater celerity than the body politic&#x27;s ability to overcome the enormous chaos of a completely free market.<p>History isn&#x27;t even necessary in the argument though. We all get to vote. Bitcoin has already failed as a currency. It is subject to incredible moodiness and instability, which are the characteristics of a very poor currency indeed. Currency, in a well functioning economy, is supposed to be the most stable and predictable security that one can invest their wealth; in theory, it is not even supposed to be a security.

Most people who take advantage of this are collectors and movie makers.<p>As for me, I&#x27;ll pass on jumping through enormous hoops only to buy a machine that turns money into noise: ask a member of the US armed forces how many times he&#x27;s actually used the M4 or M16 in fully auto or even burst as opposed to semi-auto. This is reflected in the M16/AR-15 design: they aren&#x27;t designed for &quot;spray and pray&quot;, they&#x27;re designed for carefully aimed and disciplined fire in semi-auto mode (with occasional full-auto bursts for supressive fire or against metal armour).<p>> <i>I personally think not. Is there really a difference between hand grenades and automatic rifles? Again, I personally think not.</i><p>Well for starters, go to a range that rents automatics (like one in Las Vegas), shoot a fully automatic rifle, and then put it down. Then, pull the pin on a hand-grenade, drop the hand-grenade next you, and then stand in place :-) [No, I don&#x27;t actually encourage you to do this]. Or you may want to consider why police cruisers have rifles (albeit semi-automatics) but not (explosive) grenades -- rifles are person-to-person weapons, grenades are effectively area/anti-materiel weapons. (Random note: When I lived in USSR, my school PE classes actually included &quot;grenade toss&quot; -- you&#x27;d toss a stick grenade filled with inert substance -- as a sport; it&#x27;s quite challenging.)<p>I think the difference is immense, they&#x27;re completely different kinds of weapons -- first of all hand grenades, aren&#x27;t technically arms if you use the definition of arms used when the constitution was written.<p>They would not be protected by the second amendment even if fully automatic weapons were. Fully automatic weapons on the other hand aren&#x27;t protected for the same reason &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; (as much as I hate this phrase...) isn&#x27;t protected, grenades are not protected for the same reason that setting fire to a theater isn&#x27;t protected.<p>While this isn&#x27;t tested, semi-auto rifles, are almost certainly protected -- as they&#x27;re owned by civilians in great numbers (unlike hand grenades or automatic rifles) and compare to pistols (demonstrated per case law to be protected by second amendment) are far less frequently used in homicides (despite there being more rifles/shotguns in circulation than pistols). This certainly passes the &quot;unusual and dangerous test&quot; used in Heller to rule out automatic rifles, hand-grenades, missiles, nukes, etc... and all the other frequently asserted strawmen.<p>I&#x27;ll point you at an excellent book that offers a far more nuanced reading of the second amendment than either side wants to admit -- <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Gunfight-Battle-Over-Right-America/dp/0393345831"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Gunfight-Battle-Over-Right-America/dp/...</a> -- including the discussion of what militia means (which is different from what it means in Switzerland, although not entirely unrelated)",1385583069

It’s like a little trophy.&quot;<p>I was the <i>exact</i> same way -- right down to the explanation as to why I didn&#x27;t want an ereader. I just loved everything about physical books. The texture, the smell, and, embarrassingly, the vanity of having an apartment filled with books. And then my work bought me an iPad. Everything changed almost immediately.<p>I absolutely <i>love</i> being able to have an army of books with me at all times. As a guy whose still a student, 95% of my time is spent with technical books. It is absolutely amazing to have everything at my fingertips at all times. I can pull up whatever I feel like studying at any point throughout the day. Few minutes of downtime at work? Maybe I&#x27;ll read a chapter in my Patterns book. If I&#x27;m not feeling that, I just swipe over to Programming in Scala and have some fun. Also, being able to search a book is worth its weight in gold.<p>That said, there are a few draw backs which irk me. Though, I think these can really be solved with better software.<p>Firstly, referencing two places in the book at once. How many times have you been reading a textbook and kept your finger in one section while reading another so that you can quickly hop back and forth? Impossible to do quickly with readers. You got to create bookmarks, with each &quot;flip&quot; open the bookmarks, find the one you need, and finally select it to view the page. With physical, all you need to do is flip to where your finger is and presto! Done. The digital equivalent requires multiple taps and a good bit of waiting.<p>The other drawback is DRM. After a fiasco with Amazon (which I otherwise love), It became clear to me that DRM books are not worth owning. I purchase almost exclusively from O&#x27;Reilly due to the fact that they offer a plain old, DRM free PDF. I give them money, then give me the product -- not a licence to use the product under their terms, the actual product for me to do with as I wish. Currently, it&#x27;s very tough to find all the books I want to read as DRM-free pdfs. I&#x27;m doing my best to vote with my wallet, so that means there are many books that I simply don&#x27;t buy anymore because I like actually owning the things that I purchase.<p>Other than those caveats, eBooks have completely replaced physical ones for me.

Gold is the most obvious example; if currency was inextricably tied to governments, there would not have been a mad rush to colonize the New World (and extract its gold reserves).  In prisons cigarettes frequently serve as currency, as a medium of exchange that is widely valued.<p>What really makes a currency is <i>confidence</i>.  People have to believe that other people will continue to value the currency later.  Government backing can provide one source of confidence.  But so can strong crypto, and one could argue that these days people have more confidence in crypto than in governments.<p>What&#x27;ll really kill Bitcoin is that this speculative wave has made the price incredibly volatile, so volatile that real merchants selling real goods have no idea what to price things at.  So everyone holding Bitcoins purchases them for investment value, and then the price will crash when it stops going up.  That destroys confidence in the currency, which destroys the currency.<p>I could easily see a successor currency based on the Bitcoin protocol emerging from the ashes, though.  By then the speculators will have been burned so badly that they&#x27;ll stay far away, so it&#x27;ll quietly gain adoption in the background, and then eventually become the new currency of choice when inflation starts to make it&#x27;s way through current fiat currencies.",1385582642

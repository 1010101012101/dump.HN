So, I guess it would get moved, but the GC probably won't run unless the first gen space is pretty full. I'm glossing over details because, well, the GC in the JVM is a very complicated piece of work, and I don't know much of the details, but the JVM does in fact default to a stop-the-world garbage collector[1].<p>I don't think anyone actually expects the JVM to beat C++ using stack allocated objects[2]. Our concern is how well a garbage collector handles lots of small objects.<p>[1] Details on how the JVM GC works: <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/gc-tuning-5-138395.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/gc-tuning-5-138395.ht...</a>\n[2] There is a switch, which will be on by default one day, that lets the JVM do escape analysis so it can allocate objects on the stack automatically.",1308668280
2678984,story,,,3,4,dominiek,"Why I think HTTP is Overrated",,"(Note: this food for thought based on an internal dicussion)<p>Overall, I think we (web developers) are often trying to cram functionality that belongs to the Application Layer (actions, events, data flows, etc.) into Transport Layers like the ""holy"" HTTP Protocol. This forces us to model our logic into HTTP ways of thinking like CRUD, REST and passive states.<p>Take for example, HTTP status codes. When ""My App"" cannot perform an action because it couldn't connect to an external API, or it couldn't perform some Magic Sauce on an object, the error that results should belong to the Application Layer, and should not be any of the Transport Layer's business. Trying to figure out status codes for these kind of failures I think is wrong.<p>With new practices like SocketIO, HTTP becomes nothing more than a Transport Layer. SocketIO is responsible for making your browser-side communicate with the server-side (or any other node) as real-time as possible. It does so using whatever is available in the environment (XHR-polling, JSONP polling, Websockets, Sockets in Flash, etc.). Transports like JSONP cannot even cope with HTTP status codes, JSONP is an entire new transport on top of HTTP.<p>With applications becoming more complex, more real-time and more event-driven, I think we have to move away from HTTP thinking.<p>HTTP has been great, but let's not get sentimental. The web has moved on.",1308668276

This became casual stuff even for the non-techie. So what's the point of censorship? Making access to the web a little bit harder? If you censor a video on Youtube, someone else can upload it to Facebook and watch it through HTTPS and diffuse it to many people.<p>Aren't (the French Gov. and other Govs.) aware of that?

2678977,comment,2678338,2678338,26,0,scelerat,,,"Absolutely the thought of this kind of ""feature"" used to actively cripple a democratic tool by big gov is chilling. i.e. ""What if cops used it to mask abuses?""<p>But somehow it's the more banal applications I can imagine that would deliver a more real sense of oppression. Stores turning it on so that nobody could photograph their displays, meaning you couldn't take a picture with your mom if you were out shopping. Or buildings broadcasting the ""don't film"" signal such that photographers wouldn't be able to take pictures (i don't know why they like to do this, but this activity has been consistently upheld by courts). Lots of entrepreneurs have ideas that inevitably revolve around the utility of ubiquitous cameras which would be nullified by ubiquitous camera-canceling signals. And so on.<p>The chilling effect could become commonplace. And then in the event of a real crisis when you do want photos, people can't take them because of a stupid IR signal. What you do then? Oh crap! There's a guy getting beaten in front of me. Nobody move; let me run to Walgreens and get an IR filter!",1308668199

All of the optimizations and reports of performance improvements were in the ""Tunings"" section, and were considered apart from the findings in Figure 8. Well, except for the Go Pro version, which blurs the division.<p>They could have used a sentence in the opening of the ""Tunings"" section to reiterate that the optimized versions are not represented in Figure 8. The different versions in Figure 8 are mostly tuning the GC, not tuning the implementation itself. And, strangely, they <i>do</i> include the Go Pro version in Figure 8. Certainly, though, the C++, Java and Scala Pro versions are not in Figure 8, which is where they drew most of their conclusions from.",1308667373

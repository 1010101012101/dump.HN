I worked so long & hard trying to take care of things I wasn't skilled enough to do that I was too exhausted to maximize on my talents.<p>So, I would say focusing on your strengths is a key to success.

2401074,comment,2400976,2400976,3,0,matthodan,,,"Apologies in advance for not answering your question directly.  Frankly, I wish I could have caught you before you paid for Textmate, as I would have encouraged you to try VIM.<p>VIM has become one of the most popular editors among Rails developers and many Textmate users are making/have made the switch (myself included).  It takes a week or two to get familiar with VIM, but once you are comfortable you'll never go back to Textmate.  Having just gone through the VIM learning process, I think you should do the following:<p>1) Download MacVIM (I assume you're on a Mac) and understand that your VIM configuration is stored in your ~/.vim folder and ~/.vimrc file<p>2) Search for example .vimrc files-- Tim Pope has a nice example at <a href=""https://github.com/tpope/tpope/blob/master/.vimrc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tpope/tpope/blob/master/.vimrc</a><p>3) Build your own .vimrc file from scratch-- research everything you add to your .vimrc using :help (:help is huge, don't discount this) and Google.  Think of this step as building your own text editor.  VIM is extremely customizable, but unfortunately it doesn't ship with all of the functionality that users expect enabled<p>4) Install pathogen, then install each of these plugins in the bundle folder in your .vim directory:<p><pre><code>  - rails.vim (syntax highlighting, navigation, and much more)\n\n  - snipmate (easily create custom code snippets)\n\n  - nerdtree (browse project files)\n\n  - command-t (find/open files within project easily)\n\n  - vividchalk (color scheme)\n\n  - ack (text search within project)\n</code></pre>\nThere are probably 100 other plugins people will recommend, but I think these are a good start<p>5) Write a blog article about your experience.

The upper bound on power isn't cost or availability, it's something far more immovable: battery life, size and weight.

I wanted to learn Rails because there's plenty of work opportunities for it, Ruby is neat, and is built around a *nix and OSS.  Do what you like.<p>I started learning web dev with Rails recently and am very close to deploying a small but significant project.  Here's my two cents on how to learn:<p>0.  Pick something you want to build.  Solve a problem that nags you or someone else.  Or reimplement something as you think it should be.  Hack to learn.<p>1.  If you're new to web dev, go to wikipedia to at least figure out how all the parts fit together (JS/CSS/HTML on client side, web servers, etc.).  You should be able to at least diagram what does what.<p>2.  For JS, CSS, and HTML, w3schools is a great place to start.  Read all of the stuff on there for those three things (JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, etc. can be put off for a short time).  It's relatively light and concise so it can be read entirely up front.  Write yourself some pages to test what you read.  Styling can be fun!<p>3.  Unlike the previous reading topics, I would NOT suggest reading a massive book or all the Rails guides up front.  I get bored on long reading stretches and question the effectiveness of the time spent; I'm sure this is common.  I prefer to do a little reading to get me started, build something until I need to figure out a missing piece, read to fill in the puzzle, and repeat.  You'll make mistakes along the way, but you'll learn actively.  You'll slowly pick up the fundamentals of Ruby without having to read an entire language primer.  You can and should improve your skill over time by supplementing it with more comprehensive resources.  However, that's for another day after you have something minimal running.<p>If you know an overview of Rails, you can at least outline an architecture of your app to be built.  Then you figure out how to implement the parts of that architecture using Rails by selectively reading small parts of a variety of sources.  For me, I used snippets of the Rails guides, Hartl's book, Stack Overflow, the Rails API docs, and a variety of blog posts.  I bought one of the Peepcode screencasts but didn't see the great benefit that is suggested by their user comments.  Start easy and work towards the hard stuff.  At least you'll have a string of small accomplishments for encouragement to go further.<p>On the other hand, I ended up reading 70% of the dev guide for Android to build my first app.  It's in a world of its own so you have to do the long reading haul.",1301779802

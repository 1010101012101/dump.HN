I instinctively associated that word with logging in, so i kept looking for where to ""sign up"". A better word would be username.<p>When signing up using the big orange sticker icon on the right, you get no status message as to what happend after submitting the form. It was only after trying to sign up using the top left link that it told me ""username exists"" which meant the sticker signup apparently worked.<p>Not requiring a password on initial signup tells me you want ease signing up as much as possible; why are you requiring email validation then? Seems counter-productive. \nLet users gain instance access, and then delete accounts that haven't validated after a set timeframe, (with reminders).<p>Minor pet peeve. The facebox boxes have too little padding on the left/right margins. It does not look nice.<p>I tried to sign up for a course by clicking on the plus sign, but after I do that I am lost as to actually how to ""take"" the course. Maybe this is a lack of content issue, but I'm still puzzled as to whether these courses have video, audio, read like a textbook, or??<p>That is all for now.",1242518387

612752,comment,612642,612642,0,0,dfranke,,,"I wouldn't touch this without first giving it a very thorough security audit.  Zed is right that most MTAs in use today are Byzantine horrors, but he misses out on why they were written that way: security.  A mail server needs to bind to a privileged port, aggregate every user's mail into a single outgoing queue (which must be stored on disk for reliability), setuid into arbitrary users for delivery, and sometimes execute arbitrary commands given by those users (procmail).  This is not an easy thing to get right.  The reason for the strange design of Postfix, qmail, et. al. is to allow them to implement privilege separation wherever they possibly can.  The thought of throwing all that away, and substituting a lightly-tested, monolithic program written in a dynamic language that permits monkey-patching at runtime and doesn't have Perl's taint checking support, makes me nervous to say the least.<p>Mail servers, web servers, C compilers, libcs, and crypto libraries all seem to share the common property that their basic functionality seems enticingly easy to implement, inducing the naive to look at the mainstream implementations and think, ""Look how stupidly bloated these are!  I can do way better"", and go on to produce nice elegant, minimalistic implementations that immediately fall over when put into production.",1242518170

612740,comment,612276,612638,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"> And isn't it suspicious that meditation always leads to a higher place?<p>Er, what? Meditation is a chance for you to stop <i>reacting</i> to everything around you, stop <i>reacting</i> to the animal impulses that keep floating up in your mind, and just see the world and your mind for what they are. If somebody cuts you off in traffic or makes fun of some idea that you hold a little too close for your own good, you probably feel anger or irritation building up, but that's just some animal part of your brain making noise. (It doesn't know that not everything is a matter of life and death.) You can let it go, and you don't need to get mad and snap at people because you had a crappy day at work. (That doesn't do anybody any good.) Likewise, don't get so caught up in thinking about a bug that came up this morning, or whatever, that you forget to taste your lunch. You can spend so much time worrying about an idea, <i>something that doesn't even exist</i>, that you forget to appreciate the things that do.<p>If your idea of a ""higher place"" is a world in which people stop doing as much stupid shit because they're no longer reacting like threatened animals half the time, then, ok, cool. (I think that capital-e Enlightenment is another idealized thing to drive yourself crazy trying to chase. Not all Buddhists believe in enlightenment, though there are probably as many Buddhisms as there are Buddhists.)<p>Also, a lot of the religious stuff came into Buddhism because, well, try showing that stuff to someone thousands of years ago in India, then having them explain it to someone else, ... who shows someone else in China how to see their mind working that way, who ... and see if it gets a bunch of their cultural symbolism mixed in along the way. Nowadays, we talk about the mind like it's a computer. <i>Is it a computer?</i> Or do we just talk about it that way because that model seems useful to us? Will that seem weird to people in the future?",1242517329

I enjoy it at the time, but not in retrospect. I come home tired. When I go out with the person I love, on the other hand, I truly <i>enjoy</i> myself—even if we ended up doing absolutely nothing but, say, waiting in line all night, I come home invigorated, and remember the night fondly.<p>This isn't a matter of remembering <i>them</i> fondly. The feeling I recall is that I was able to <i>be myself</i> the entire night; I had none of the ""jealousy, suffering, discontent and stress"" that comes from a social situation where you aren't truly aware of the motivations of the people around you, and thus have to put on a ""face"" of only the highest of social intentions and mannerisms (perpetuating the cycle, because then <i>they</i> don't know what <i>your</i> motivation is.) This may be a relic of introversion, of course, but I think everyone can feel it to some degree.<p>Also, the author is speaking of a different type of party than that which you're thinking of, I believe; he's referring to open-to-anyone parties with bouncers and alcohol—amateur versions of nightclubs. In such a party, everyone is indeed on edge. In a private gathering of only your true, closest friends, you will indeed be able to ""let your hair down"" and the negative emotions will evaporate... but most parties are not that party. Songwriters; pop, rock, rap, and hip-hop songwriters in particular, go to the more common type of party exclusively; it's part of their their livelihood to attend these ""events."" Thus, this is what they sing about. I hesitate to reference a song less than ten years old, but this is a somewhat relevant description of the sentiment the author is trying to capture: Glass Danse by The Faint -- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSwzvatqE6I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSwzvatqE6I</a><p>Now, I don't know what all that had to do with meditation, but for the fact that <i>your own mind</i> is another place where you can ""let your hair down"" and be yourself, and that many people are so socially immersed at all times that they forget that their thoughts are not bound or inspected by the same social contract.

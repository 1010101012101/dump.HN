9050429,comment,9049917,9049917,0,0,kanzure,,,"> The key argument is this: proof of work, at the core, can be seen in two different ways<p>Neither of those ways are how anyone describes proof of work. I can offer two explanations. First is the explanation of the Byzantine Generals&#x27; Problem from bitcoin.org:<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20090309175840/http://www.bitcoin.org/byzantine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20090309175840/http://www.bitcoin...</a><p><i>A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King&#x27;s wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they&#x27;ve learned is a certain number of characters in length. Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, lest they be discovered. They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.</i><p><i>They don&#x27;t particularly care when the attack will be, just that they agree. It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce an attack time, which we&#x27;ll call the &quot;plan&quot;, and whatever plan is heard first will be the official plan. The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different plans at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.</i><p><i>They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general receives whatever plan he hears first, he sets his computer to solve a difficult hash-based proof-of-work problem that includes the plan in its hash. The proof-of-work is difficult enough that with all of them working at once, it&#x27;s expected to take 10 minutes before one of them finds a solution and broadcasts it to the network. Once received, everyone adjusts the hash in their proof-of-work computation to include the first solution, so that when they find the next proof-of-work, it chains after the first one. If anyone was working on a different plan, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.</i><p><i>After about two hours, the plan should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce in the allotted time. At the least, most of them had to have seen the plan, since the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it. If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.</i><p>Second is a more general understanding:<p><i>Proof-of-Work (PoW) works because of the economic restriction provided by the second law of thermodynamics. Even though you can&#x27;t know you&#x27;re in the consensus set, you can put a raw economic cost on the probability of you being tricked.  Bitcoin uses proof-of-work to tie Bitcoin consensus to a fundamentally scarce resource, namely negentropy. It is possible to use another physically scarce resource instead, but there is no alternative to the universal scarcity of negentropy. As maaku puts it, &quot;I could be an AI trapped in a simulation with no knowledge of the outside world other than the foundational laws of physics, and from that be able to assert the validity of proof-of-work.&quot;.</i><p>(Really it has nothing to do with currency. Sorry folks.)",1423940322
9050428,comment,9049698,9050354,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> If you limit yourself to boxed and stack variables, which is a pretty big limit when writing larger programs.<p>That&#x27;s more or less how most C or C++ programs work, however. C and C++ programs (including the Linux kernel) use reference counting when the object lifetime is truly dynamic. For example, file objects going back to the very first Unix have had to be reference counted, because they can be duplicated via the dup() system call, inherited via fork(), or sent from process to process via cmsg.<p>The big advantage of the C/C++/Rust approach comes from the observations that (a) the vast majority of objects only have one owner; (b) reference counting does not have a global performance impact when used only for a small subset of objects.<p>> And as noted by a sibling comment, you can create a memory leak due to cycles if you use it imprudently - do we consider that to be a safe use of memory?<p>It&#x27;s a tradeoff: reference counting is bad at cycles, but has advantages due to prompt deallocation, avoidance of the mark phase, and (in Rust) avoids unnecessary cross-thread synchronization. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>unsafe</i>, because leaks can happen in any language, including garbage-collected ones: you can have arrays in global variables that grow without limit, for example.<p>Remember that the criterion that GC uses—no more references to an object—is ultimately a <i>heuristic</i> approximating what you really want, which is whether the program will access the data in question again. Of course, due to the halting problem, we can&#x27;t actually solve that problem, so all garbage collection algorithms approximate it, with the requisite possibility of leaks.",1423940321

They said that western media is all corrupt and unfree, and that Russia Today is a &quot;welcome&quot; and more honest alternative.&quot;<p>And how are any of the the above concerns baseless?<p>Media cartels, whether Western or otherwise, are organized in a hierarchy, wherein editors review and cull the content of their subordinate journalists.  Such an arrangement results in a militaristic concentration of power which can be exploited to control discourse locally, regionally, nationally, or, globally.<p>Frankly---and this may ruffle some feathers here---rather than questioning the Putin régime’s influence on Russian media, the West should be collectively asking why Israel-partisan Jews have such disproportionate influence in Western media.

Many have wondered why the Russian propaganda machine is spewing out a torrent of such preposterous claims that few people take seriously.<p>They know it will not be believed abroad. The purpose is not that it is believed.<p>The purpose of disinformation was is to destroy trust in <i>all</i> media.

Not using their service, because their service is silly, but on Mesos.<p>I am not locked into a 1:1 tenancy between applications and instances (though I could have it if I wanted). Multitenancy is trivial. I have the ability to spin up new instances of my applications to combat spike loads or instance failures in single-digit seconds rather than in minutes. My developers can run every container within a single boot2docker VM instead of incurring the overhead of running six virtual machines. It&#x27;s easier to integration-test because my test harness doesn&#x27;t have to fight with Amazon, but can rather use a portable, cross-service system in Mesos. In addition, I don&#x27;t have to autoscale with the crude primitive of an instance in production. Multitenancy means that I can scale individual applications within the cluster to its headroom, and only when the entire cluster nears capacity must I autoscale. I can better leverage economies of scale, while allowing me to leverage more vCPU power to applications that need it (running two dozen applications on a c3.8xlarge is very unlikely to bring to bear at any given time <i>less</i> computational performance to a given application than running each application on its own m3.medium).<p>I could do this without containers and with only Mesos. It would be worse, but I could do it. I could not do this at all with baked AMIs and instances without spending more money, doing more work, and being frustrated by my environment. I know this I&#x27;ve built the same system you describe (I preferred vagrant-aws because when something broke it was easier to debug, but we moved to Packer before I left) and I would never go back to it.

In my personal projects, I would keep experimenting with different languages, frameworks , libraries, patterns etc. and they would all end as an unfinised github project waiting to be deleted.
Whereas in projects done at workplace or as freelancer, the technology stack is fixed and you limit yourself experimenting with too many libraries. At the end of the project there is learning and a finised product to be proud of. Not impliying here that personal projects should not be done, but too much experimenting increases the chances that the project wont go to production.

Far more important than that of the global warming, for example, simply because it blocks meaningful discussion on the subjects that really matter.<p>While the public opinion is manipulated both in the US and in Russia, the methods and outcomes are vastly different. For a diligent study of the US media manipulation I highly recommend Chomsky&#x27;s book &quot;Understanding Power&quot; [2]. You may disagree with his opinions, but they are still worthy of consideration because Chomsky backs up each observation with a verifiable reference, to the point where all of the references combined make an entire separate book of equal volume. If you don&#x27;t like Chomsky&#x27;s answers, you will at least appreciate the questions he&#x27;s trying to tackle.<p>I haven&#x27;t read the headline book yet [1], but it has the potential to shed some light on how things are done over in Russia. Between the two works, I hope, one can gain actual knowledge of the methods of the public opinion manipulation.

It doesn&#x27;t offer any concrete examples or any attempt to actually validate what this guy is saying. It also doesn&#x27;t even attempt to compare this to what the media landscape looks like in other countries.<p>If all that happened was that a &quot;prominent news anchor reviewed the coming events as if they were part of a film script, musing on how best to entertain the audience and questioning who that week’s enemy should be&quot; then this doesn&#x27;t sound too different from what probably happens in some US news rooms as well.<p>I have no trouble believing that Russian TV is a propaganda machine and projects like the World Press Freedom Index [1] tend to agree.

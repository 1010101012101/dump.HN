Unless you are some kind of star in your own right, the odds are that almost nobody beyond random followers are going to include you in their circles. That basically leaves you with the option of circling others in order to have anything meaningful in your stream. Here again you are more or less guaranteed (in current conditions) that next to none of your friends/family is going to be on G+. So you are left with the option of circling strangers only, which is not what you would normally do on a social network.<p>The great thing about G+ is that in this large group of strangers there is a huge number of tech (and other) luminaries who are actively engaging on the network. Circle them and you basically get a stream of comments, thoughts, links and pictures that are really worth following. I've only circled about a 100 or so of these ""strangers"" and I've just loving the interaction. Sure, nobody (or very few) +1 anything I have to say, but that doesn't bother me as I'm far more interested in what they have to say. No way you can call it a ghost town when you engage in G+ this way.<p>On the other hand, if you circle nobody then it does become a ghost town. But it would hardly be fair to call it one.",1338110912

In the first few weeks I built up over 1500 'followers'. If I posed a question I would get responses. Now, nothing. If I ask a question I may get, at most, one response a few days later.

I also did the P90X doubles version, which starts at month 2 and adds 3 more endurance workouts weekly. All that taken into account, I still managed to get good functional muscle growth.<p>It is very easy to modify the program to suit your needs. If your friends do not care that much about endurance, I would suggest not doing the doubles version, keeping rep counts low (eight or less) and trying to increase the weight from week to week. They should also take in enough protein, perhaps through whey protein supplements, but definitely no steroids.<p>What's more important than anything of the above is how much effort you put into every workout. If they push themselves hard enough during the resistance training parts, there will be nothing to worry about and there's plenty of massive after-pictures from P90X online to prove this.<p>P90X will give you massive performance improvements for almost every physical activity.

4029710,comment,4029523,4029627,4,0,Jd,,,"For me the Twitter use case is to keep myself stimulated while working remotely by interactions with other people in my field, catch breaking news as it happens (e.g. blog articles on new tech), and to promote work that I have done (e.g. blog articles I have written). So when I am working actively on a project, I probably check 4-6 times a day. In between I probably check 2 times / week. I also have used monitoring tools like awe.sm to see how many people re-tweet things that I tweet out, among other things to make sure I'm providing value to people that are following me (i.e. high signal to noise ratio). I also use twitter to answer questions that I can't find the answers to elsewhere -- generally very technical questions.<p>Facebook is a tricky one, since it promotes addictive ""stalking"" behavior. I've attempted to use it primarily for messaging and to hide most people who aren't in my immediate vicinity, thinking that I probably don't need to know what they are doing. Still, I am a part of ""liking"" tribes where there is an implicit economy of trading likes on something and receiving likes back.<p>G+ I only use when I get annoying messages from Google that someone has asked me a question or added me to some circle. Other than that I avoid it like the plague -- this despite being an enthusiastic adopter in the early days.<p>LinkedIn I use probably once a month, except in the occasional moments where I am actively networking. I get very little value here since I am not usually looking for work and the technical folks I interact with are available on Twitter (or, at worse, email).",1338109577

What's your thoughts on that?<p>I'm personally trying the reg park system (pre steroids style powerlifting, through stronglifts.com) because i'm aiming for a bit of bulk (i have no illusions of becoming mahoosive).",1338109431

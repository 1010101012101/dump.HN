It'd leave such huge holes in the market that just beg for someone to come in and fill them with a lean startup.</i><p>I've seen a lot of this attitude lately, so I want to coin a term: startupfreude!",1223819438
330293,comment,330181,330181,0,0,alecco,,,"As a foreigner, the problem I see with Silicon Valley is the US-centric business models. A typical web page engine and backend has English and US-dollar so hardwired the standard solution is to just open up a separate store on each country from ground up.<p>Typical issues are pricing, product listing and descriptions, data transfer interfaces, APIs, and sales tax calculation. Something that should take a day of work to do  often ends in ""we can't do it without affecting the main site negatively.""<p>The irony is many of the Valley's entrepreneurs are foreign themselves.",1223819386

To put this into concrete terms, we still have all the food we can eat, adequate medical care, enough homes to house everyone, assorted consumer goods that make us happy, and the means to produce all of these as needed.<p>The crash of the financial markets has not reduced the production capacity of any of these goods or services. There will still be enough of them, only the dollar values attached will be different.<p>In contrast, during the great depression, lots of <i>actual physical wealth</i> was destroyed. Various other policies reduced production capacity, most notably the NRA and Smoot Hawley.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administratio...</a>",1223817834

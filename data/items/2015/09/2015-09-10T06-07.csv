If you want to be a professional, and be treated like a professional, you need to act professional. Harsh perhaps but that&#x27;s the truth.<p>If this is a serious job solicitation and not just catharsis you are doing it all wrong. Starting with how desperate you are, how proud you made your mom, and how shitty you&#x27;ve been doing and been treated does not make the hirers of desirable jobs want to hire you. If nothing else, go google &quot;just-world hypothesis.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not in a hiring position right now (although I know plenty of hiring managers itching for referrals) but if I were I wouldn&#x27;t touch you with a 10-foot pole even if on some level you make your plight sympathetic.

I&#x27;m going to send you some mail and see if I can help you out directly in about a minute, but I&#x27;d like to comment on your situation here too.<p>This is the third time this month I&#x27;ve heard of a startup &quot;CEO&quot; screwing their employees out of pay and/or benefits, specifically exploiting &#x27;interns&#x27; or severely low-balling entry level hires who don&#x27;t know better. Startups are hard. They&#x27;re supposed to be hard - you&#x27;re trying to build something big without the resources of a big company. That means you can&#x27;t pay what a big company would pay. That doesn&#x27;t mean you get to screw people over.<p>As a founder you have three options:<p>- Do tons more work as a founder. Fill in the gaps you can&#x27;t hire for on your own, until you can pay to get that help. That&#x27;s why you get the equity, and that&#x27;s how you build your founding team.<p>- Be up front with people about what they can expect in terms of pay, especially early on. Let them know about the risk. Hope your idea and the state of the company so far excites them enough to join anyway. Work your ass off to improve their situation and get them to stay.<p>- Lie to people, obscure expectations, and basically screw up people&#x27;s lives because you want to be the next Steve Jobs.<p>The first two are not only ethical, but pragmatic. Being able to do things on your own is a prerequisite to being a founder, and it means you need to take on less investment, you get to keep more of the company. Being able to put your ass on the line by letting people know the real risks is the way to build a strong, loyal team of tough people.<p>If you&#x27;re going to be a founder, mull that stuff over. Accept that this is hard. You don&#x27;t get to pretend it&#x27;s not, because that will bite you in the ass a hundred different ways.",1441868293

10196467,comment,10195947,10196242,0,0,jcranmer,,,"Go&#x27;s &quot;time&quot; library is deceptively simple. Time, in real life, is quite incredibly complex, and hiding that complexity from developers (as Go&#x27;s library does) does them a great disservice.<p>To start with, there are actually two distinct notions of time: monotonic and wall-clock. In monotonic time, you want to measure time intervals with high accuracy: a second of monotonic time should correspond as much as possible to the physical span of a second (in the inertial frame of reference of the computer in question, because screw relativity). More importantly, when it&#x27;s not possible to correspond that time, you at least want guarantees like &quot;time never ticks backwards.&quot; In contrast, wall-clock time is about matching a (there&#x27;s more than one, and the definitions can and do change unpredictably, possibly even retroactively) civil reference clock as accurately as possible.<p>If you mix those two notions of time, you can evidence problematic results--changing the system clock five months back, for example, caused my music player to suddenly stop playing music (most likely because a callback timer was scheduled on wall-clock time and therefore would be waiting a few hundred days to start playing again).<p>Which brings into the next obvious problem: leap seconds. Any span of time greater than 1 second is actually an ill-defined span of time in that it can have multiple values. Once every few years, a minute has 61 seconds (theoretically, it can also have 59, but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet in practice). So if you&#x27;re requesting to add a minute, do you really mean &quot;add 60 seconds&quot; or do you mean &quot;add 1 to the minutes field&quot;? POSIX (and anyone else who counts time as seconds since an epoch) opted to handle leap seconds by pretending they don&#x27;t exist, which causes leap seconds to be so dangerous that, for example, the NYSE stopped trading for about an hour around the last leap second to avoid problems. I can personally attest to seeing date/time parsers choking on leap seconds. And it&#x27;s not entirely clear if leap seconds actually exist in civil time in some jurisdictions, because there is a small amount of vagueness in the laws.<p>While on the topic of the differences between jurisdictions, do also note that, for historical dates, you really need to think about the difference between Julian and Gregorian calendars, as well as the fact that the date of adoption of the Gregorian calendar varies from country to country (thanks Protestant Reformation!). Oh, and the year didn&#x27;t necessarily start on January 1, either, and the change from March 1 to January 1 happened differently for different countries and differently from the Julian->Gregorian adoptions.<p>Time is hideously complicated.",1441868255

10196438,comment,10196231,10196231,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t offer you a job.  I can only offer a couple of pieces of advice (some of which I wish I could wait a while to give... but since I probably will never get the chance to speak to you again...)<p>1. Tell your wife ASAP about the job situation.  No matter what stress she is under, learning about it later may cause serious problems.  She can help you (emotionally and in trying to find answers to your problems).  The better off you are emotionally, the better chance you have of finding a job quickly.<p>2. I&#x27;ve seen stories like yours a lot in my career.  Some people are selfish.  A disproportionate number of these seem to end up in management/entrepreneur roles (luckily, not all!!!).  To your boss you were merely a source of cheap labour.  Take the &quot;cheap&quot; out of the equation and he was not interested any more.  I&#x27;m afraid that this is probably not the last time you will run into this, so be prepared.<p>3. This is locking-the-door-after-the-horses-have-bolted kind of advice, but if you find yourself in a similar situation (it happens a lot in this industry): get the new job first and negotiate for salary second.  It&#x27;s horrible, but that&#x27;s the way you have to do it.<p>4. If you get the new job first, think hard about whether or not you really want to negotiate salary in the first job.  If in doubt, don&#x27;t negotiate -- just leave.  I tell my employers up front that I don&#x27;t negotiate salary, so they have to be prepared to offer me enough that I will accept.  They won&#x27;t get a second chance.<p>5. Remote working with no academic background and 8 months of experience means that the next job is going to be tough to find.  Keep at it, even if you have to take another job doing something else in the mean time.  Eventually you will make it, though you may be in for some difficulty for a couple of years.  Trust me on this one.<p>6. I hate to say it (I really do), but depending on where you live, your salary expectations may not be reasonable.  For example, $45K USD is very nearly $30K GBP.  In London, I can get university graduates with intern experience lining up outside my door for that salary.  In hourly wage it represents $22.50 per hour worked (8 hour day -- excluding holidays).  That&#x27;s 2-4x minimum wage in the US.  If you are offered that salary again, I advise you to take it.  Just do whatever it takes to keep working (easy for me to say, I know).  Keep looking for the bigger payout and don&#x27;t worry about &quot;loyalty&quot; for now.  Once someone respects you enough to offer you a good wage, <i>then</i> work on building a good relationship with them so that you can grow together.<p>- It may take you some time to find another job.  In the mean time, spend every free second you have writing code.  Build an amazing portfolio.  Some people don&#x27;t care about it, but I have gotten good jobs from my side projects.<p>Again, the biggest thing I have to say is not to get too upset or disappointed.  Just keep moving forward -- even an inch is enough.  Whatever you can do right now is enough.  Never give up.  Good luck!",1441867655

What then? Mobile payments is not a faucet you just turn on. They&#x27;d have to convince the entire market - retailers, banks, and credit card companies alike - that they needed to incur tens of million dollars of infrastructure changes and possibly more with fraud in order to... well, what exactly do they get? They&#x27;d move from something that people were used to (credit/debit cards) that had clear risk profiles to something unknown with little evidence of consumers willingness to adopt and no added benefit to retailers or banks.<p>You might respond - its a better user experience! Banks don&#x27;t give a shit about user experience, thats why they close at 4pm. Retailers don&#x27;t either, thats why they&#x27;d buy POS machines with crap UIs and never replace them even when the digitizer could barely create a signature.<p>Banks and credit card companies care about risk, and retailers care about keeping costs down and seeing clear benefit in the form of evidence of consumer interest before adopting. Banks and credit card companies are also powerful, quite conservative, and are middle-men that do not necessarily have users interests at heart. Nobody in this industry turns on a dime (heh). Knowing this, Apple chose to wait for the steady trickle of POS machine replacements in the coming POS transition that would follow from Visa&#x27;s EMV migration announced in 2011 [1], focus on risk-reduction and gaining leverage with credit card companies and banks through TouchID, and launch Passbook as a proof of concept both to train users and show retailers that people want to use their phones. Passbook wasn&#x27;t an mobile payments competitor, it was a progenitor. It sidestepped major gaps in infrastructure, and it was placed in the second or third tier of iOS features due to its limited usefulness.<p>Passbook seems to be what you&#x27;re hung up on. Here&#x27;s a question - if Apple is so amazeballs that it could have moved the market in 2012, why then are there still retailers and banks that are slow on the Apple Pay uptake? Is it because Google and the coalition of second tier nobodys is missing? No, its because banks and retailers generally don&#x27;t give a shit about user experience, manage their infrastructure at their own pace, and have all sorts of issues and internal politics that affect their decision making about _anything_.<p>You keep saying the same thing and haven&#x27;t provided nearly enough evidence to support the leaps you&#x27;re making that Apple somehow killed the beautiful &#x27;open&#x27; fairyland that would have been NFC in 2012. There was no NFC market in 2012 to split, just bumbling attempts that misread how to make headway in the market, and a handful of Android phones with the hardware just so they could say &#x27;first!&#x27; I&#x27;d love to see evidence to the contrary.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.emv-connection.com/emv-migration-driven-by-payment-brand-milestones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emv-connection.com/emv-migration-driven-by-paymen...</a>",1441867063

That&#x27;s pretty much it besides not being a liability or a risk. Hence the profile cleanse, positivity, demonstration of ability by getting your code into GitHub and so on.<p>Then go forth and market the hell out of yourself with tons of positive vibe. What I&#x27;m telling you here is pretty much to do very much the opposite of what you&#x27;re doing. Absolutely don&#x27;t beg. You may get charity but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to be happy with it considering your salary expectations and family situation. You&#x27;re going to want to land a job earning $75K upwards with excellent benefits in a stable and growing business. That means they need to think that you&#x27;re awesome, so make yourself awesome and go and kill it.<p>Best of luck!!<p>~Mark.",1441865996

After that, it&#x27;s $x per month per student (or $$$ flat for the whole school per year). Hook them, get them dependent on it, and then charge them for your useful product.

You have to sell your way into their budget planning and you have to do it far ahead of time. The no cost introductory period exists solely to provide you time to sell your way into their budget plans, because that can take a lot of time and effort.

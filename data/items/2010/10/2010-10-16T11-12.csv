what I looked for in life"" (and they are seldom). Taleb p.255 The Black Swan, 2007.<p>* He could also have said an ""Athenian among Boeotian"" but Romans are powerful (vs. Boeotians) and Benoit Mandelbrot had to fight the establishment with his visual research. ""Pariah amongst French Mathematicians"". With his Fractal images, his work was ""remarkably easy to understand"" for the general public.<p>* Unlike in Rome, the most popular shows in Athenes were not Circus WWE gladiator fights, it was going to Aeschylus or Sophocles tragedies.<p>Taleb's homepage <a href=""http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/</a>",1287229332

Feuerstein spent millions keeping all 3,000 employees on the payroll with full benefits for 6 months. By going against common CEO business practices, especially at a time when most companies were downsizing and moving overseas, he achieved a small degree of fame....it appears that applied ethics in business has positive consequences as Malden Mills continues to garner lucrative Department of Defense (DOD) contracts for 'smart' products that interweave fiber optic cabling, electronic biosensors, and USB ports into polar fleece fabric.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Feuerstein"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Feuerstein</a>",1287229093

1797761,comment,1795182,1797653,0,0,alecthomas,,,"You core complaint seems to be that maintainers don't maintain their software. This is sadly true in many cases, but I would argue that GitHub has actually improved the situation.<p>First, by making it trivial to get patches to the maintainer. Prior to GitHub, if you wrote a patch for a project, you would have to track down the appropriate channel to submit the patch, then jump through any hoops required. Whether it be mail directly to the maintainer, a patch on a bugtracker (probably also requiring signup), mail to a mailing list (again probably requiring signup), patch having to be in a particular format, etc.<p>The second problem is what to do if the maintainer doesn't respond? Sometimes you might end up forking the project and hosting it in yet another random web page. Sometimes you might just end up dumping the patch onto the net, in the vain hope that someone else would find it if they had the same problem. I have done both, a number of times. With GitHub, the patches are clearly there as forks.<p>At least with GitHub, the barrier to writing a patch and getting it in the face of the maintainer is almost zero. This is an improvement. If they don't respond, at least it's obvious to users from the proliferation of forks, and if they're lucky they can find the particular fork that fixes their issue.<p>Solving the human problem of maintenance is a big challenge. If GitHub solves that as well, I'll be amazed.",1287228655

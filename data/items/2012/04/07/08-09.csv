3810353,comment,3808194,3809883,3,0,lispm,,,"'interesting' is a somewhat vague concept. You need either 'interesting for a lot of people' and/or 'easy enough for an implementor who would create such a thing'. It is also important that a programming language and its implementation is used by people who develop new stuff. Currently no large company supports Lisp for that - not Apple (they did that in the 80s), not Google, not SAP, not ... Sometimes they buy technology which has traces of Lisp. Google bought ITA software - they are a Lisp shop. Apple bought Siri, Siri had traces of Lisp in - the original research project was done at SRI, which assembled modules written in many languages - among them Lisp. But that's it.<p>When display-oriented text editors were developed, very early Lisp programmers implemented them in Lisp and even created engines which were portable for it (the Emacs C part which implements a simple Lisp runtime).<p>When a CAD company needed an extension language, they added a simple Lisp dialect written in C to their CAD system. Born was Autolisp for AutoCAD - used in millions of installations.<p>Today there are enough alternative languages around which can be easily embedded - for example Lua.<p>Common Lisp is slightly more difficult to embed. One either uses ECL (Embeddable Common Lisp) or a home-grown Common Lisp variant. Which for example Quicksilver ( <a href=""http://www.broadvision.com/en/quicksilver.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.broadvision.com/en/quicksilver.php</a> ) or PTC's CREO Elements ( <a href=""http://www.ptc.com/product/creo-elements-direct"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ptc.com/product/creo-elements-direct</a> ) do.<p>You might never hear of the latter two - they are interesting applications - but not used by that many people.<p>There are interesting and unique applications written in Common Lisp - but their user domain is very specialized. In music composition you could use OpenMusic, PWGL and several others. In cognitive modelling (used for example to test user interfaces) ACT-R is used. In proving correctness of software something like ACL2 or PVS might be used.<p>But these are certainly not the interesting applications you have in mind, even though there were probably hundreds of interesting research projects done with something like ACT-R - but it is software for a narrow user group.",1333787821

3810337,comment,3809836,3809836,4,0,b1daly,,,"I've only read a few writings by Richard Stallman. It seems plain to me that he is an egomaniac with some kind of rigid obsessional thinking patterns. People like this are very annoying, and ironically undermine their own case if they intend to persuade others of their views.<p>The willingness with which he labels the practices of large swaths of the population (of the US) ""unethical"" would be very disturbing if he was a political leader with significant power.<p>Oddly, the patterns I see evidenced in his writings (that I have read) remind me of the thinking used to justify totalitarian states!<p>I think his views on his core issue of the badness of copyrighted software are not well thought out and absurd on their face. He makes a point of pointing out that the copyright laws are arbitrary, they are not some kind of natural right. One of his main arguments is that making a copy of a digital good does not destroy the usefulness of the original, or harm the person who has it in his ""possession.""<p>What he is apparently oblivious to is that a system of laws is entirely a social construct. It contains huge amounts of arbitrariness. The whole concept of property is extremely abstract, unless you consider it in some kind of caveman scenario. ""It is wrong to take this food that a person has in their hands because then they will be deprived of the ability to eat it."" As far as I can tell that's how he thinks about property.<p>I think a lot of his confusion is because he is an absolutist. He thinks laws should be ""ethical."" There is certainly an overlap between law and morality. But there are major areas of disunion.<p>IMO, the ability to accept ambiguity in the areas of law, ethics, and personal conduct is needed to keep society humane.<p>Just writing this to think through my thoughts.

The last time I saw/used Sharepoint (I had a 2-day sharepoint user training ~9 months ago) I was really unimpressed.<p>Don't get me wrong, managing documents with Sharepoint works. Somewhat. But all the web stuff seemed really half assed to me. The Wiki doesn't work, building pages and sites is PITA and search does not work out of the box (and as far as I can remember you need an expensive add on to make it really work).<p>I think they also told us that developing for/with sharepoint can be quite tricky and upgrades to newer sharepoint versions can cause problems - But I am not sure If I remeber that correctly.<p>Even if everything above worked find, I don't think it is a good idea to create a MVP with a tool like Sharepoint, which has it's own (quite inflexible) way of doing things and forces you into certain processes. You should really be able to iterate fast and create exactly what you want, and not be constrained by the structure, process and templates of a (huge, hairy) tool when building a MVP.",1333786774

I probably just need to always keep every scrap of data we get, then find the right ways to combine the data into a score with one routine, and compare the scores to calculate compatibility with another.

The big lawsuit that really kicked it off was over The Hurt Locker, which isn't an MPAA-affiliated movie.  It was kick-started by a lawyer named Thomas Dunlap, who worked out the idea with Uwe Boll for his shitty movies.  The RIAA stopped going after file-sharers when its lead attorney, Donald Verrilli, was appointed by Obama to be Solicitor General.  That alone was more than they wanted.<p>All of these mass lawsuits are the idea of small, sometimes desperate lawyers, not content providers or publishers.

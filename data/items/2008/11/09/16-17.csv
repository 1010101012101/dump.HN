358339,comment,357937,358247,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Modern subdivision house construction is basically a moving assembly line.<p>I don't think prefab makes any sense for a premium modern house.  You want to use materials like steel reinforced and chemically sealed concrete, stucco, stone, and perhaps solid hard wood.  You can't feasibly transport this stuff from a factory to a building site pre-assembled.  Prefab only potentially makes sense for light chintzy crap made out of wood and fiberglass, and even then on-site construction teams are very efficient at nailing together stick-wood houses on a concrete foundation so you're not going to save anything.",1226249923

What are they selling?""<p>Degrees, GPA, US News rank, X vs educational attainment (e.g. future earnings potential), etc.<p>""What benefits?""<p>The story of school. That is, what it means to be well educated/qualified is having a degree, having gone to a good school, having gotten a good GPA, etc. The social currency these things bring is all tied up with the story of school, or its foundational myth, or whatever you want to call it. By going through the system you earn the right to invoke the story.<p>""What would ""anything else"" be?""<p>Anything else. As it stands the only way to renounce adolescence is to become sanyasi sankalpa, which isn't a very good option.<p>""Sounds like a bullshit theory to me.""<p>Maybe it's a bullshit theory, maybe it's the most poignant observation about western civ ever made, but you're smart so figure it out for yourself, I'm not here to play Bodhisattva.",1226247743
358326,comment,358256,358271,0,0,bokonist,,,"It wasn't invented out of the blue, but it was an evolved creation of politics.  In classic democratic fashion, a lot of factions were pushing their own agenda that ended up making the country as a whole worse off.  The education establishment has continually upped the drop out age.  Labor unions ( in alliance with wealthy parents) pushed for stricter child labor laws to reduce competition for jobs.  Aristocratic progressives wanted an institution to indoctrinate immigrants in the American way of live.  The rise of credentialing laws made college a necessity for earning a decent income.  Since colleges require a high school diploma, this put teenagers in an eight year holding pattern, waiting for a piece of paper.<p>The result of this has been every bit as disastrous as Newt claims.",1226247582

Does it actually lead to works not being made, to creators going back to their day job? Is the cost actually bigger than the benefit of copying the work?<p>Also, as a policy this aligns the incentives correctly: it means creators and publishers are encouraged to find a way to distribute their work everywhere as soon as possible.

In my experience Forth and J are such languages: you can &quot;learn about&quot; them, but you won&#x27;t really understand them without using them for some time. So I suspect APL, K, Q and Eli here are similar; the question is what will I gain from becoming proficient with one of them or alternatively is it worth becoming proficient in one of them if I&#x27;m already proficient with another.",1418730891

The key to solving this problem lies less in reducing government powers, but in distributing it better. By the principle of subsidiarity, regulation should always happen at the lowest possible level. At first sight, it sounds inefficient to have slightly different laws that govern the same things in every state. But there is a lot of value in diversity, as it allows for direct comparisons and thereby the system as a whole to evolve much more naturally. Also, it allows for fine-tuning of regulation to local situations.",1418730784

I hope they see it through and the safe harbor agreement is the first thing I&#x27;d rip up and throw in the the face of whichever kangaroo US President you have now or next time.<p>Then Microsoft need to win their upcoming court case against the USG, which will demonstrate clearly to everyone that the USG cannot open the electronic equivalent of a private sealed letter stored in a bank safe in Ireland, because they damn well feel like it.<p>The US constitution needs another amendment to protect the privacy rights of all, regardless of whether they are US citizens or not. It is time the citizens of the US started pushing for it. These three letter agencies with their massive black budgets funded by narcotics are your mess and it is time you sorted them out.<p>I&#x27;ll leave this here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass</a>",1418727633

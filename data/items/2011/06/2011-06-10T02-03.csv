There was one Amazon reviewer who claimed Whitaker was leaving out specific studies that contradicted him, though when I actually read them studies mentioned they either supporter Whitaker or else were orthogonal to the claims. If anyone has found anything intelligent on the subject I'd love to see it though.<p>It's important to remember also that the best case scenario is that these drugs aren't as outright harmful as the research suggests, the other issue is that most of the research supporting them is of extremely low quality, which is pretty self-evidently true.",1307674746

While you can select only specific fields by using {fieldA: 1, fieldB: 1} as a 2nd parameter to find, you can also exclude fields using -1. Interestingly though, you can't mix inclusion or exclusion (which makes sense if you think about it), except to exclude _id.  So {name: 1, description: 1, _id: -1} is possible.<p>2-
Sending SIGUSR1 to the running mongod process will rotate the logs<p>3-
We got a 25% memory/storage reduction by shrinking our field names. YMMV. I knew how data was stored, but I didn't know what amount we would specifically save :P<p>4-
Count returns the value of found documents regardless of paging. This lets you pull documents + get total # very easily. If you pass true to count, you'll get the actual returned # of documents.<p>5-

It's a solid book, but not doing a lot for me.  As a counterpoint for pro-drug advertising it's fine, but it feels more like a journalistic expose than science.  It's not that it's wrong, rather it feels like the author started out with a conclusion and then did a lot of fine research to find supporting evidence. I feel like I'm being given only half the story: a well-founded and less-told half, but still I worry that the author might have chosen to omit any evidence that weakened his case.<p>I'm enjoying another book (not reviewed in this article) that I grabbed off the new book shelf much better.  ""What is Mental Illness"" by Richard McNally.  He's a Harvard psychology professor who's served on committees for DSM-IV.  It touches on a lot of the same issues, seems a little more current rather than historical, and by and large I trust that he's representing the field as he sees it.  I also like the prose better: a fun combination of low brow and erudite. It's highly critical of the field, but also balanced in a way that I don't find Whitaker to be.  <a href=""http://mcnallylab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mcnallylab.com/</a>",1307673610

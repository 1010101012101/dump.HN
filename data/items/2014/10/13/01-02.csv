8447217,comment,8446542,8447177,0,0,kbeaty,,,"Very interesting.  I certainly have some reading to do.<p>Can you explain a little more the notion discrete values and sampling rates and how that applies to stream processing?  I assume that it applies to sampling values of a process over time, but what would be an example in computation where the value would be considered continuous?  Is it similar to continuous vs discrete signal processing?",1413165591
8447216,comment,8444603,8445010,0,0,kentonv,,,"> The problem is that reasoning can be applied to any feature you want to get rid of.<p>Well, of course it can. That&#x27;s more or less the Chrome team&#x27;s point: they want to remove any feature that isn&#x27;t widely used, because every feature is an attack vector.<p>> A good reason would be, we had N vulnerabilities in ext4 in the last six months, which is more than the kernel FAT support, which had only M vulnerabilities.<p>Not really, no. The absence of reported vulnerabilities in a time period could mean that there are none, but more likely it just means no one has looked, like with Bash. The things you need to ask yourself when considering attack surface reduction are:<p>* How complicated is this piece of code? (More complication = more bugs.)<p>* Is it likely that this code has been well-studied with respect to the proposed threat model? (For ext4, probably not -- it&#x27;s designed to be used on your internal disk, which is not an attack vector.)<p>* How painful would it be for users to simply remove it? (Obviously, removing ext4 harms far fewer users than removing FAT, developers notwithstanding.)<p>> Besides that, the attack vector seems fairly theoretical to me. Most users will take a blank SD card and format it as ext4 themselves.<p>Theoretical? Flash drives loaded with malware are an actual, widely-used attack vector, used by everyone from simple identity thieves to governments (look up Stuxnet, which was used to damage Iran&#x27;s nuclear infrastructure).<p>Things have gotten better since Windows stopped auto-running software on such drives, but a filesystem exploit that kicks in on mount would be more effective and harder to detect (no telltale files visible in the file browser).",1413165562

That leads to the notion, that you just have to remove the those to have a perfect system.

Not only universities, but also small inventors, that have good ideas and depend on the possibility that big corporations buy their inventions and thus they could be realized, since many inventions are just beyond of the financial capabilities of single inventors or smaller companies. There are many cases where patented ideas are simply stolen, because the corporation don&#x27;t want to buy the idea from the inventor. When they sue subsequently, they are now insulted to be &quot;patent trolls&quot;.<p>Even with the patent trolls problem (that exists) solved in a fair manor, it would not solve the problem of low (up to no-) quality patents.",1413165467

Trolls don&#x27;t. Universities license their patents on reasonable terms and seldom litigate or even threaten litigation. Universities are able to do this because their patents cover valuable technologies. Trolls Trolls buy up crap patents and wield them like a motorcycle chain wielded by a street thug on unsuspecting passers by to see who&#x27;s got a wallet worth taking.<p>Yet, by your lights, none of the above is an abuse of process. Even the patents sold off by failed ventures are toxic. Relatively few things a zero-stage venture has implemented are worth patenting.

In some sense they&#x27;re nearly &quot;arrowized&quot; as you&#x27;re focusing on the transformation of &quot;reactive&quot; quantities, but they&#x27;re certainly discretized and tied to sampling rates in their formulation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Keynote-Duality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Key...</a>",1413164189

The teams are painted into a fairly confined box, where every car is mechanically and visually similar. Then they throw in Gimmicks like DRS, Push to Pass Kers, and tires that degrade quickly, all in the name of making the racing more exciting. Winning the championship pretty much means finding a loop hole to exploit the first half of the season and then coast to end.<p>the WEC on the other hand gives teams a lot more latitude in answering the question of &quot;how do you go fast for 24 hours?&quot; and that is very apparent when you look at Audi, Toyota and Porsche. 3 very different cars as far as overall design, engine capacity, engine design, fuel type, hybrid system capacity and design.<p>A V6 Turbo Diesel with a flywheel hybrid system, a V4 Gas Turbo with a battery hybrid system, and a normally aspirated gasoline v8 with twin Super Capacitor Hybrid systems, that put down 1000HP when all three are engaged.<p>3 Very different cars, but so incredibly close when it comes  to overall performance, and that is with out much Balance of Performance, Push to Pass, or DRS systems, and they actually have tires that last.",1413163819

Do you want Congress telling Amazon which video formats they have to use, and which formats the devices they sell must support?

ANY market where the price of an item is higher than its marginal cost is an inefficient one. (The cost includes opportunity cost, though, so it&#x27;s not like the widget factory needs to make zero accounting profit on the operation).<p>It&#x27;s quite probable, of course, that software in the general case is prone to market inefficiencies, especially in the short run: there are high fixed costs associated with producing software.

7304871,comment,7302645,7303681,7,0,pekru,,,"> Treating low skill commodity workers as human beings on the same social level as yourself is such a destructive western practice. So is hiring a stranger with a great github rather than your brother in law, hiring a woman if she is the most qualified, etc. Or there is that destructive western practice of managing by output - the boss is working until 8pm but you can go home as soon as you hit your quota.<p>I really don&#x27;t know what to say. If it is your assumption that every firm/organization in India follows nepotism and doesn&#x27;t value true merit, it would be simply a wrong assumption, IMHO. Aren&#x27;t we all aware as to how Wall Street or any big business in the West hires? <i></i>cough &quot;Business Networking&quot; cough<i></i> I guess a good read in this regard would be &#x27;Liar&#x27;s Poker&#x27; or &#x27;The Big Short&#x27; by Michael Lewis. [1] There have been corporations(might not be in the truest sense, but a collective of skilled workers with a common directive nonetheless) in India which have achieved amazing feats in the past. One could even say that few of the harmful practices of the West (reckless crony-capitalism for one, or the practice of prioritizing the aim of maximizing shareholders&#x27; investment over general public/social responsibility) was an unknown thing but now, it is gaining good traction in India unfortunately. One might find it surprising that India didn&#x27;t face a subprime/financial crisis when US was neck deep in it. &#x27;Managing by output&#x27; isn&#x27;t really a copyright of the West. In fact, the concept of measuring butt-in-seat time or shifts was totally alien till folks from the West brought it here. (And later pushed further by Adam Smith&#x27;s Labour theory) Prior to that, it was pure ownership of a task and responsibility. Kautilya&#x27;s Arthashastra specifically deals with labour theory and even flexi-time to an extent, by taking into account productivity and quality of throughput and not just rote effort/time spent. [1] The skilled artisans/craftsmen never worked by the clock, and thus were able to achieve great things. For them, it was all art. There wasn&#x27;t even a clear line between art and sciences, but everything was art, including science/maths/engineering.<p>Off note, I wonder if the mother of that kid that died in Bhopal on that fateful night might have wondered, how the world would have been now if the white man hadn&#x27;t embarked on the noble enterprise of <i>burdening</i> himself to <i>civilize</i> the non-white people.<p>Also, am quite sure that the affluent and middle class folks in the West are terribly happy <i>treating low skill commodity workers (who might be immigrants) as human beings on the same social level as themselves</i>.<p>I really would want to write a long post. Will certainly do so once time permits.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_Poker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_Poker</a> / <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://userwww.sfsu.edu/mbar/ECON605/Arthashastra.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://userwww.sfsu.edu/mbar/ECON605/Arthashastra.pdf</a>",1393422926

So maybe the GP was referring to that, but then again (while I don&#x27;t know the specific market in London), there is plenty of supply in that market in every big Western city I know a bit about, so I assume the same for London. Then again you pay 100% premium on those spaces.<p>What I was reacting to is what I hear relatively often - &#x27;hey my house/room rent is X / m2, why can&#x27;t I find an office for that price? It&#x27;s just me and my buddy and we&#x27;re broke and most likely out of business in 6 months, why don&#x27;t landlords love us?&#x27;.<p>&quot;We believe that Spacious can help liquidity in the market by making landlords and space operators confident that if they react to shorter contract lengths, they won&#x27;t have to worry about long periods of vacancy as a potential tenant would be able to find them easily.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me what you&#x27;re doing any more, since you seem to contradict yourself. Are you about making landlords turn themselves into coworking spaces, or do you have some way to guaranteeing a higher occupancy rate for owners, or are you just Craigslist for office space, like there are a zillion others? What&#x27;s your added value? The coworking space is so crowded, I don&#x27;t see any savvy owners who are not in dire straits dive into that market any more in 2014. There is vast oversupply (at least at price levels that make it profitable) in the (admittedly small, niche and out of the way) markets I know about. Those who tried it find out very soon that the small hidden costs add up very quickly, and that it&#x27;s a completely different kind of business from &#x27;just&#x27; renting out property (and a business most don&#x27;t want to be in).",1393422819

IdeaSparked - a Simple Idea Management Tool.<p>I built this for a couple reasons - initially for myself, I&#x27;m one of those people who gets a ton of ideas and I previously kept track of them in notepad, google docs, a notebook, etc - and I&#x27;d always wanted to build something more custom to my needs.  So this was really built out of personal want/need.<p>The second reason was I wanted to learn a few new technologies and start building a portfolio up.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of &#x27;solid&#x27; framework experience, so I decided to take a stab with Laravel PHP Framework.<p>I also wanted to learn one of the Javascript frameworks and decided to use KnockoutJS.  I think it works great for what I&#x27;m using it for in this app.<p>I also used Stripe API to handle payments.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m looking for some general feedback, not really expecting this to take off but I wrapped it up to be used by others if they wish and maybe it will be useful.  It really helps my two needs (self-use and learning) and I&#x27;ll continue to use it and update it as my needs and those of any users change.<p>I know I&#x27;ll have some bugs and some beta users have been very helpful with those so far, but any additional feedback, tips, would be greatly appreciated.<p>Summary:\nSite: http://www.ideasparked.com\nDemo: http://www.ideasparked.com/user/login/demo<p>Simple Idea Management Tool that allows you to add, manage, and track all of your ideas.  Can categorize them, see what status they are in, make notes, outlines etc.  Have a list of some minor features coming soon (custom Idea Types, search filters, etc) and some more extensive ones down the road (public ideas/discussion, exporting, wireframing perhaps).",1393422401

Let me tell you, it&#x27;s not as simple as this.<p>It&#x27;s not just the 50$ or whatever to put up one online ad. You need to advertise on several websites plus offline. You need to show around various candidates, and do background checks on the serious ones. You have to transfer utilities, deal with mail, and other assorted tasks when somebody moves in. All of this for (in terms of yield) slim margins. And assuming that nothing is damaged or needs fixing up after somebody moves out.<p>Now, for commercial space it gets worse. When they go out of business, it&#x27;s highly unlikely that you will recover the owed rent - likely several (2-3) months. Commercial real estate is vacant for longer, and having a tenant &#x27;in between&#x27; basically &#x27;resets&#x27; the cycle of getting a new tenant. (businesses take a few weeks to months before deciding, residential is usually faster, i.e. faster turnover)<p>Also, businesses usually make changes when they move in, not always for the better (network rewiring, dividing space etc for offices - for storefront it&#x27;s much worse still). If they go bankrupt, you as the owner are stuck with the cost of repairing. The deposit (a paltry 2 or 3 months rent) is usually not sufficient.<p>Again, all of this is assuming that there are no &#x27;real&#x27; troubles - no lawyers involved, no &#x27;real&#x27; renovations needed after they move out, ... Just the cost of getting somebody to dispose of an abandoned office full of furniture costs a month rent, because second-hand office furniture isn&#x27;t worth anything!<p>For me, I don&#x27;t bother with terms of < 6 months for rentals, not even for a 100% premium (residential that is, I don&#x27;t do commercial).

Its not perfect, but its as good as it tends to get.<p>I think that one of the issues with placebo research is this notion of mind-over-matter, in that such a viewpoint is the reason that it is perceived as special, and also a reason why people disbelieve in it.<p>Based on old research (Levine, 1979) many (but not all) placebo effects in pain appear to be mediated by endogenous opioids,which I would take to mean that they are pretty naturally mediated by the brain, and so its a physical phenomenon. Many people do go a bit crazy with the woo around it though, I do agree.<p>Funny that this came up today, when I&#x27;m currently finalising a hopefully final draft of my thesis on the placebo (PROTIP: never, ever leave your university before submitting a PhD, it tends to go badly).",1393421028

Design and production floor feed back on each other and some design decisions were optimized to production realities such that you could at enormous expense either reinvent the chemical milling processes or simulate them with EDM and/or CNC mills but it would be enormously cheaper to scrap the design for a chemically milled door or whatever and replace it with a door designed specifically to match the modern technologies of EDM and milling machines.<p>The other example I can think of is I don&#x27;t think we have the tech anymore to make aerospace grade core memories.  Too much info was in the brains of people who died decades ago.  To a first approximation the cost would be something like the entire fixed capital expenses of the whole computation industry from 1940-1960 plus many man years of R+D and more importantly reverse engineering and reinventing the QA/QC that man rated aerospace grade core memory would require.  It would be a heck of a lot simpler and cheaper to use modern tech.<p>There is an obvious computing analogy.

Having big &quot;pixelly&quot; fonts doesn&#x27;t look good if they&#x27;re not blocky pixel fonts, the anti-aliasing just makes it look like you&#x27;ve slapped any old font on there. If you&#x27;re going for blocky/pixelly then do it well.<p>- The controls. Though I get that it&#x27;s the gameplay mechanic, I couldn&#x27;t find any correlation between where I hit the screen and the direction the foo moved. Am I missing something? does tapping on the left of the screen make the foo move left, and likewise for tapping the right?",1393419784

With a gun, you have to put all your energy in as kinetic energy at the start of the trip, which means the payload leaves the earth at a considerable speed. Objects passing through the atmosphere with that sort of speed lose a lot of energy as drag.<p>There&#x27;s a continuum between guns and rockets: you can fire a projectile with a motor on board. That lets you launch with a lower speed, but you have to lift fuel along with your payload. It&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>Space elevators step outside the tradeoff because they add energy to the payload during the trip, to avoiding the drag cost, but don&#x27;t have to lift the energy as fuel, so avoiding the weight cost.",1393419772

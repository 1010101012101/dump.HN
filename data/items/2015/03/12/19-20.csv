I&#x27;m about to move to the bay area on a $125K salary with my partner - not sure what kind of job my partner will find as he isn&#x27;t an engineer. It looks like I might have made a mistake accepting that offer. What do you think? Could someone have a comfortable life with a $125K salary in Silicon Valley?<p>I&#x27;ve been poor in my life once, the kind where you don&#x27;t have enough to eat and you go to bed hungry (dictatorship country), so I totally feel for these people. Poverty has a snow-ball effect as someone else noted here, and this effect could possibly be stopped or slowed down at early stages when you have the right opportunities, but once this effect has really taken off, it&#x27;s very hard to stop it or come back from it.<p>In my experience, people will work hard to end their sufferings when you give them the right opportunities.

If I&#x27;m not mistaken the Windows Kernel actually does support fork()-ing, but the win32k system somehow &quot;forbids&quot; it (lots of grains of salt). After all for a long time there was a commercial UNIX compatible offering on Windows that probably used fork() all over and must&#x27;ve worked (also it supported case-sensitive names for the filesystem)<p>BTW, the coolest usage of fork(), and granted a pain in the ass to port possibly was the one in REDIS where antirez used it to fork() at certain time the current process, then write back the state of memory knowing that it&#x27;ll get a &quot;snapshot&quot; of it, and if writes to disk succeed, this &quot;snapshot&quot; would correctly and fully be written to the disk.<p>I know there are plenty of other uses (for example this way &quot;lua&quot; can do threads with just a bit of a communication library on top... e.g. any language without explicit thread handling can actually use them).<p>Wondering what made win32k folks disable it.

Linear algebra is one form of abstract algebra which is easily one of the most important mathematical disciplines.

Statistics is the mechanism of interpreting live data under knowledge of uncertainty toward generalization.

There are some hairs to be split in this distinction I think. I mean, taking a video out the window of a personal / private aircraft is suddenly under the FAA&#x27;s purvue by implication? I don&#x27;t think they would be wise to go that route, but if they are, that&#x27;d be good to know in a hurry. There are a LOT of YouTube videos that suddenly run afoul of an overly broad interpretation, I&#x27;d wager.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming to have the last word on this, but rather using my inherent stubbornness, creative background, and understanding of intellectual property / fair use / artistic case law as factors in the discussion.

9193355,comment,9192154,9193028,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> The goal is to get a return on investment...<p>This is a simplistic, overly idealistic understanding of venture capital that is unfortunately constantly repeated but rarely rebutted.<p>The goal in venture capital is to be able to continue to raise funds. On a $500 million fund, a venture firm locks in $100 million in management fees over the life of the fund (assuming the standard 2% annual management fee and 10 year fund life) regardless of performance. Not a bad deal.<p>But it gets better. Because of the nature of venture investments, it&#x27;s all but impossible to declare a fund a winner or a loser a few years into a fund. But a firm won&#x27;t wait 10 years to raise its next fund. It&#x27;s going to raise its next fund not more than a few years in, and in a hot market like this one, that fund is likely to be bigger, so the firm gets to lock in another 10 years of management fees on an even bigger pile of money.<p>Carried interest (your &quot;return on investment&quot;) is icing on the cake for venture capitalists. Because most LPs are muppets who will continue buying the same inferior product, the real imperative for a venture firm is to make sure its funds are not total dogs. Given historical venture capital returns, that basically equates to not blowing up your fund.",1426190057

Maybe 25% gets you there but at that scale 25% could mean hundreds of active drivers which is very expensive to muster with driver incentives.

Maybe investing in Keith Rabois&#x27;s new startup is a bad decision, but it is only happening because he&#x27;s a partner at Khosla. If you&#x27;re an LP in a VC fund, this is something you could reasonably be concerned about.<p>2. If you&#x27;re an entrepreneur pitching to a investors, you expect that the pitch is being taken in good faith. If the investor is just taking your pitch so that they can access your proprietary information and use it to inform their own startup (funded by the firm you&#x27;re pitching), that&#x27;s pretty wack.<p>I have literally no information about these examples, so it wouldn&#x27;t be meaningful for me to hold an opinion on whether or not impropriety is occurring. I also think that Keith Rabois probably has enough of a track record that he could easily raise funding for pretty much whatever he wants to do. I also suspect that most entrepreneurs aren&#x27;t particularly worried about point 2.<p>Nonetheless, this is clearly right at the nexus of the objections that people raise about SV: that it&#x27;s an old boy&#x27;s network masquerading as a &quot;meritocracy&quot;. It just smells fishy. Sometimes things smell fishy and are OK... but there&#x27;s always a cost to doing things that smell fishy: the appearance of impropriety is often just as harmful as impropriety itself.",1426188730

That is, <i>everything</i> is an action that eventually returns a value, and it all is used the same way. There are no special syntaxes -- loops, conditionals, function definitions, everything. Since it&#x27;s all the same, everything all the way up to the top level is one action composed of other actions chained together.<p>Parentheses in Lisp languages are used differently than other languages: parentheses are used for grouping and ordering in other languages, but in Lisps they&#x27;re used to denote scope. The first word after an open paren is always an action, and every word thereafter is always an argument. Then arguments can be a lower level of scope which performs another action, and so on.<p>So really, Lisp has almost no syntax at all, and a Lisp program is nothing but a big tree of actions that start at the top level and work down (sort of).",1426188349

If you are a motivated learner, <i>you would be out there learning</i>, as there is no better place to learn regardless the class structure.<p>Does that mean you are a talentless hack? No. Looking at my own history, what it means is you are lying <i>to yourself</i> (which is the worst kind of lie) because you don&#x27;t want to put in the hard work.

You cannot provide a theoretical concept as a service. You can provide <i>an implementation</i> of an algorithm. So it would be more correct to say that they just run software libraries on their servers.<p>For many &quot;algorithms&quot; going to an external server to process the data would be way more costly than to just get a software library and run it locally.

That&#x27;s your language design.<p>At one point I thought: &quot;If ML is so great, then why don&#x27;t you see it more often in the real world?&quot;  And then the revelation was that Python essentially uses ML to describes its AST:<p><a href=""http://svn.python.org/projects/python/tags/r32b1/Parser/Python.asdl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.python.org/projects/python/tags/r32b1/Parser/Pyth...</a><p>This is Zephyr ASDL, an ML-inspired DSL for describing ASTs.

I think you can produce extremely compact and flexible interpreters with this architecture, and there are several other advantages to dividing it this way.<p>The downside is perhaps a more complex build process, but the OCaml toolchain is quite nice actually, and I have compiled it from scratch.  It&#x27;s head and shoulders above Haskell in that regard.  OCaml can produce .o files and link with C/C++, so you still get one executable.<p>I looked at your Wren language which I like a lot.

Funny enough out of &quot;functional&quot; languages those have probably just as much (or even more) been used to develop distributed, fault tolerant systems than F# or Haskell. Just saying.<p>(I generally agree with the gist of your comment, I think. This just stuck out.)<p>I don&#x27;t believe Clojure belongs in that class (as &quot;proven&quot; for writing reliable software), but whatever.<p>If you want truly reliable software and have the budget, then you just need to throw <i>process</i> at the problem -- it doesn&#x27;t matter much which language you use. Several (if not all) the Mars landers were programmed in C -- with very few critical flaws experienced/discovered[2]. The Ericsson switches that achieved previously-unheard-of reliability were programmed in Erlang, but they used <i>process</i> and a huge number of engineers to achieve that. (Plus they&#x27;re mostly stateless and so can just reset if they do it fast enough and don&#x27;t lose <i>important</i> state when doing so.)<p>For large-scale software which <i>has to evolve fast</i>, I belive strong type systems do win out. It&#x27;s not so much that they prevent bugs which could be caught by test suites, but having a strong type system means that you can be <i>certain</i> that there are a <i>lot</i> of tests that you actually will never have to write or, more importantly, <i>rewrite</i> as the system evolves.<p>There have been actual studies which may be of interest[1], but even if I&#x27;m on the &quot;winning&quot; side, I don&#x27;t think I would put too much stock in the methodology/analysis of this particular study. (E.g. concluding that JavaScript suffers from few concurrency bugs relative to other languages is kind of being oblivious of the fact that JS is single-threaded (semantically) and that all the other languages in the comparison permit &quot;real&quot; concurrency/parallellism, and that it should thus perhaps be excluded from the category or at least treated separately.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://macbeth.cs.ucdavis.edu/lang_study.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macbeth.cs.ucdavis.edu/lang_study.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotdep12/workshop-program/presentation/holzmann"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotdep12/workshop-program/...</a><p>(Sorry, references out of order because edited-post-facto)",1426187333

It is not git based, but is a simpler DVCS.  Dynamically generated pages on my home computer take less than .001 ms to display.  It has all the features most small developers need, with a builtin lightweight wiki, issue tracker, and code tree.  Your self-hosted website is available even if you don&#x27;t have an internet connection, or you can use free hosting service like <a href=""http://chiselapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chiselapp.com/</a>.  Of course it looses in terms of size of community.  But popularity does not determine quality.<p>You will likely loose arguments on public forums if you make statements like &quot;absolutely no objective reason to ...&quot; because someone just needs one reason to disprove.  Here goes: GitLab has a functioning interface for managing git projects and lets anyone selfhost the community edition.  Therefore there is an objective reason to put a project on GitLab.

They are actually <i>avoiding</i> additional legislation, by refusing to limit DPI and therefore define it in law.<p>I do wonder if this acknowledgement of VPN/Tor, which must certainly be one of the first in the history of executive agency legislation, will simply be the first of many. I hope this tacit acknowledgement does not tumble into subtle discouragement in future legislation.",1426186916

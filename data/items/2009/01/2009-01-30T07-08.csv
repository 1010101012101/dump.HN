When I worked at the 2nd largest hotel chain, they only had 8 guys in market research and about 12 in database marketing.  These 20 people determined what hotel customers wanted, what franchise owners wanted, how much cash to keep liquid for priority club reward points, which customers to contact during direct mail campaigns, and wielded technology & math like you wouldn't believe.<p>I never thought these marketing guys did anything productive either until I worked side by side with them.  These guys eat & sleep statistics and dream of k-means clustering and p-values all day long.  My boss coauthored a paper about lifetime value of an average hotel customer with a university professor.  Sometimes it's hard to judge a marketing job title until you've actually experienced the real thing.<p>I was hired to automate their data scrubbing and SAS models.  They had 3 full-time programmers to help marketing research with the 30 terabytes of customer data they had collected over the last 10 years or so.",1233302331

457850,comment,457499,457584,0,0,fhars,,,"Does the US even have a system for vocational training? Over here in germany we have this system where you go to a university if you want an academic education, but if you want vocational training you go to a company and then get an accredited vocational degree after two or three years where you work at your company like 80% of the time and visit a specialized public school for the rest of the time. 
So if I want to be a computer scientist, I go to the university, but if I want to be a carpenter or network admin, I just get a vocational degree in carpentry or network administration.
The system has some problims with things like adapting to change, but still seems better than a college or nothing approach.",1233301365

You could drive H-bridges for five stepper motors off of it, or a 14-digit LCD display, or an 8-digit LCD display and a 3×3 keypad, etc.  It doesn't have an ADC but with a little external electronics you could easily use it to digitize signals from e.g. thermistors or pressure sensors or tilt sensors.  You can run it from USB power, and USB power adapters are cheap and widely available.  You can generate voice-quality audio using PWM, although I don't think you have enough CPU power to synthesize voice in real-time; you'd have to be reading it off a flash chip or a network or something.<p>If you want to build a white-LED-driven stroboscope to check your engine timing, or get fault codes out of your OBD-II, or sound an alarm when the air conditioner is on and the window is open, or control your five-axis robot, etc etc etc., something like this is ideal.<p>Atmel has a set of application notes for the chip at <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/app_notes.asp?part_id=4097"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/app_notes.asp?part_id=4097</a> that show some example things you can do with it.",1233300596

457835,comment,457327,457327,0,0,lionhearted,,,"My XP laptop died permanently a little over a year ago, and there was a Vista Toshiba at Best Buy for $1100 on a model that was $1400 most other places. Maybe there'd have better value elsewhere, but I needed something immediate so my work wouldn't be delayed and I got it.<p>Vista: Not so bad. I'd love to see it less bloated with MS processes running invisibly, and I'd like to see it change the order things boot in so I turn it on and get up and running faster.<p>Second issue: Some driver issues and some poor backwards compatibility with programs that run fine on XP, which is quite ugly.<p>But beyond that, it's a good OS and a legit upgrade over XP. The UI is faster/better once you adopt to the learning curve. Security is legitimately upgraded, and I haven't been infected with any viruses or spyware, and I play around with random applications all the time. I like that I can easily stop non-MS programs from updating themselves without my blessing. Being able to choose giving a program default ""Run as Administrator"" vs. leaving it less privileges is really good.<p>Vista's not enough of an upgrade over XP to be worth buying, especially considering all the good SP2 did. But everyone I know that's run Vista for at least a couple months came around on it, unless the drivers thing bit them. The Vista-hate is a bit overblown, though Windows 7 does look like a legit upgrade.",1233300160

457832,comment,457736,457736,0,0,sho,,,"Good article. One thing that struck me, though, was the nature of the jobs both workers in the Smith family had:<p>""Metrostudy, the housing market research firm where he worked as a staff consultant""<p>""His wife, Kimberly, earns about the same at a retail marketing firm""<p>In other words, they both had these kind of meta-jobs which don't actually do much of anything productive, just kind of massage the system. This kind of job just doesn't seem like it has much of a reason to exist long term, to me at least - they're both kind of dependent on trying to influence/predict imperfect markets. Well, those markets are rapidly becoming more perfect, information-wise anyway - we see the beginnings of this process in Amazon reviews.<p>Market research is important, don't get me wrong - even if (when?) advertising is completely ineffective, companies still need to know what customers want. But it just seems to me that in the long term, these kind of jobs are against the technological tide.",1233300049

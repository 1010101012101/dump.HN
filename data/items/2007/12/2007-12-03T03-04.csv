I'd probably buy a lot of this if not for Rhapsody type services.<p>Their selection is truly massive it seems. A search for Mahler alone turned up 72 products. Hell, Mahler conducted by Bernstein turns up 21. Only DG could do that.<p>Classical is probably the only form of music where one label could have their own site and still have awesome selection.<p>The site design is pretty good. I mean, it's not great, and nothing a Y C group would build, but if you told me that a major record label created a site for classical music only, I'd expect worse.",1196654391

85484,comment,85406,85435,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Thing is, I don't think employers ask for a college degree because the job actually <i>requires</i> one.  I think they do it to separate the top 25% from the bottom 75%.  A degree is the easiest way to look at an applicant and be able to say ""That person is not stupid"" (whether or not that judgment is true...)<p>Now, even if everybody got a college degree, there would still be a top 25% and a bottom 75%.  And I don't think that employers would suddenly stop discriminating because suddenly everyone was qualified.  I think they'd add other qualifications, like ""must have a masters degree"" or ""must have commit privileges on a major open-source project"".<p>Then all the workers are back where they started, except that they're out $150k for their college degree.<p>I guess the only way to win is to refuse to play the game.  Which is why most of us are on this site, I guess...",1196652197

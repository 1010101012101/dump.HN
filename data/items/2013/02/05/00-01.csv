5168363,comment,5164354,5166127,2,0,danielvinson,,,"""This is, however, the bread and butter of shell programming.""<p>This is really old-fashioned thinking.  The people who have been in this industry for 10+ years all grew up without computers - and thus had to memorize all of the flags, obscure shell commands, and weird regular expression.  What was taught in school back then was to do things perfectly the first time, because CPU cycles were expensive, and bugs were time consuming.<p>The generation that graduated from college about 2 years ago is the first one that had universal access to a search engine since they knew how to use a computer.  This generation (and all future ones for the rest of time) sees memorizing things like this as more of a waste of mental space.  What is taught in Universities now is problem solving, research, and larger concepts.  There is very little straight memorization, and almost zero programming by hand/whiteboard programming.  No current college grad will be able to write a shell script without reference material, but every college grab should be able to write any simple script in less than 5 minutes with Google.",1360025966

I wish more men would speak out against this and, honestly, that it is not used to diminish the equally valid point of sexism in technology.<p>But we have to understand that in those situations it is not oppression. And that is a key point. Men are not oppressed by society when they are discriminated, because by-and-large, men make more money, have more opportunity, stay within their industries longer, are (perhaps due to last point) promoted more often, tend to be selected with a gender bias to speak about their subjects. Women currently get more college degrees in general today, yet the gender pay gap remains. That's evidence of systemic oppression. That's why we can say men at large are not discriminated against.",1360025906

5168339,comment,5167655,5168111,1,0,hashmymustache,,,"Ok I'll bite. I think the issue should focus on remedying the culture, regardless of whether boys dominate the ends. I will gently mention that boys are 5x as likely to have autism or lie within an autistic spectrum disorder loosely characterized by poor socialization skills and obsessive, repetitive behavior. They're (we're) also wired on testosterone which has different effects on the brain. I'm not saying that proves anything, but there's no point denying at the very least statistically observed tendencies in neurodevelopment.<p>Separately, people tenured in STEM positions score well, but they don't have the best grades or IQs. They are often there because they knew the right people, can argue for grants (ie their own relevance and skills), and work their asses off writing papers. I wish they were the smartest, but more often I've encountered narcissists who try to put their names on everything because it's the only way toward promotion (don't blame the player, blame the game).<p>When it comes to women, many grew up being told that if they do poorly in math/science it's ok because they're girls - this is AWFUL both immediately and downstream. Girls become more likely to blame bad performance on their sex and give up whereas guys blame bad performance as a fluke. In STEM fields, you encounter failure ALL the time, it sucks and you feel like a complete idiot. You just have to fight through it, and you're more likely to continue to fight if you aren't told you failed because of your sex.<p>It's obviously a much more complicated issue than what I laid out. It's a very tricky area riddled with people too easily offended or who capitalize on misquotes for political gain. Like I said, whether or not trends are biological or environmental, people should be told to pursue their dreams (it's not like I would tell some white kid playing basketball that he shouldn't dream of going pro because he's not as well represented or if he fails it's because he's white). Yes, that's a false equivalency, but demonstrates societal expectations from seemingly biological premises.<p>For context I'll add that I'm a guy who majored in engineering at a state school while my girlfriend graduated top 5 in her class at princeton in chemistry - we get into debates about this stuff all the time.<p>I'm SO SORRY for using this as forum to rant.

Portfolio loss distributions are computed using expected loss distributions constructed with historical asset correlations, via large MC simulations. Each ratings agency uses different metrics - moody's using the GCorr ( global correlation matrix), S&P uses creditpro etc, which changes the rating transitions. There's no foolproof way to do this - its a very seat-of-the-pants applied multivariate stats problem, where ""bad inputs"" skew the SDR ( scenario default rate ) which then drives the ultimate cdo rating.

Checking each international testing program against the other provides a chance to reality-check some of the findings.<p>What I notice about what I take (subject to correction by more exact data) to be a cultural difference influenced by differing schooling practices is that in east Asia, the other part of the world I have lived in besides the United States, girls of high school age seem more willing to show what they know in a testing situation and to engage with academic material that is deemed ""boyish"" in the United States than girls are in the United States.

5168297,comment,5164287,5168162,1,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Absolutely, on all points. If anyone thinks I'm arguing that prosecution leads to suicide (even aggressive prosecution), or that Ortiz or anyone in her office is <i>solely</i> responsible for his suicide, then I apologize: that wasn't my intent.<p>I do think that there are some fundamental questions about the circumstances though:<p>- Was the prosecution disproportionate to the crime? (I think it was; I'd be interested to hear articulate opinions to the contrary.)<p>- In Aaron's specific case, should the prosecution have taken his mental health into consideration? (I think so; I can't figure out how to argue this from a moral standpoint, because I can't think of any common ground I'd have with a person who disagreed morally. However, there is at least a legal basis for it: law already considers insanity to be a suitable defense under certain circumstances, so I can't think of a legal reason why <i>in principle</i> Aaron's mental state should not have been a consideration in his case, especially given my opinion on the first point above.)<p>- In the general case, is there room for reform of overzealous prosecution? (I think so, yes.)<p>- In Aaron's specific case, does Ortiz's office share <i>some</i> responsibility for Aaron's death? (I think so, unquestionably. I think a plausible test for responsibility is whether one's actions could have been different, whether those actions should have been different, whether the actions were reasonable given the facts at the time, and whether different actions could have resulted in a better outcome. On the first point, I think it's been made clear that there was room for a reasonable plea bargain, and the prosecutors rejected it. The second point goes back to whether or not law should recognize mental health issues in cases like Aaron's, which is perhaps still debatable, though I think it should. On the third point, no, I don't think the actions of the office were, or are, reasonable: I don't think that Heymann's response to Aaron's attorney when notified of the potential for suicide should have essentially been ""go piss up a rope"", and I don't think that Ortiz, during the fallout from this case, should have said essentially, ""there is nothing that my office could have done better."" On the final point, Taren seems to be making a strong argument that the most immediate cause for Aaron's suicide was the circumstances of his case, and I don't think I'm in a position to doubt her judgement on this point.)<p>- Does the HN community also share some responsibility for Aaron's suicide? (I think so, unfortunately. I think it's clear from comment threads about his case that there was not much support for him here, and I think there should have been. Disappointingly, some of the tone from those earlier threads is <i>still</i> present, even in this one, as with Millennium's comment at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5165280"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5165280</a>.

Given that, how would you score the sequence of events that humans managed to scale back their CO2 emissions and the world then subsequently plunges into an ice age which probably destroys civilization as we know it?<p>You may find that question is not as much a straw man as it first appears (or a false dichotomy), ice ages are a perfectly valid climate 'state' on our planet. Some literature would have you believe that the planet is <i>usually</i> an ice ball and periodically warms, but I haven't found those papers as compelling.<p>However, that we <i>cannot</i>, with certainty, rule out another ice age occurring as the 'normal' course of events suggests to me that the next millenium's climate is going to be different regardless of our actions.

When do include that, men are the majority of the victims.<p>The CDC's 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, which looked at society at large and excluded the prison population, found that 1.1% of women and 1.1% or men surveyed were raped in the prior 12 months.<p>98% of women who had been raped identified a man as their attacker and 80% of the men who had been raped identified a woman as their attacker.  This works out to men being 60% of rapists and women being 40% of rapists.<p>Here is an analysis with all the calculations laid out and tied back to the data tables in the NISVS report: <a href=""http://www.genderratic.com/p/836/manufacturing-female-victimhood-and-marginalizing-vulnerable-men/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.genderratic.com/p/836/manufacturing-female-victim...</a><p>Here is a link to the data tables with the relevant figures circled: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/aw0eU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/aw0eU</a><p>Now, the NISVS's executive summary does not tell this story.  It tells the usual story of rape being something men overwhelmingly to do women.  The way it does that is by defining rape to be 'being penetrated against your will', excluding 'being made to penetrate', which is what a female rapist would do to a man.<p>Nevertheless, the study does track how many men were made to penetrate (which it categorizes as 'other, sexual assault'), so it is possible to correct the definition of rape to one that doesn't erase female on male rape ('made to have sex against your will'), and when you do, rape ceases to be a gendered crime.<p>So yes, I can imagine what it would be like for men to be raped as often as women are.  Now, can you imagine what it would be like if female rape victims, like male rape victims, were defined out of existence, and offered no recognition, or help?",1360024689

No, he's not rich, not famous, you've never heard of him, he doesn't do anything really technology related, and he couldn't spell ""venture capital"" if you spotted him the ""venture capit"" bit.  In fact, he dropped out of school in 8th grade to go work and never really learned to read well.  I expect the Internet is about as useful to him as a skateboard is to a blue whale.<p>That said, he's one of the smartest people I know, and he has a couple of things that allowed him to become fairly successful over time:  an entrepreneurial spirit, great work-ethic, and absolute pigheaded determination.  To the extent that I have any of those things, I credit my dad's influence, whether it's a genetic thing, or just social influence during my formative years, or both, or whatever.<p>All through my childhood, my dad made attempt after attempt at starting and running various businesses.  From memory I can recall:  running a pulpwood truck, cutting down trees and hauling logs to the paper mills; making handmade crab traps; building docks and bulkheads; a shrimping business, selling fresh shrimp to seafood wholesalers; a business running a bush-hog, clearing lots and what-not; a fill-dirt and land grading/levelling business; and probably one or two more that I'm forgetting.  In between those, he made a living working back-breaking manual labor jobs, mostly on dredge boats.  But after many years, he started a business pouring and finishing concrete... doing foundations, slabs, driveways, etc.  And that one finally ""caught"" and he makes a nice living doing that now.  He's at the stage where he has crews working for him, and he just does what we would call ""business development"" and ""prospecting"".<p>Outside of my dad, if I had to cite some influential figures, I think Nicola Tesla would be on the list, as would Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Linus Torvalds, rms, Kevin Mitnick, Lou Gerstner, Tom Siebel, esr, rtm, and our very own pg.  I'd also have to give a nod to my current $DAYJOB boss, acoliver.  Oh, and Bob Young, of Red Hat and Lulu fame.  I guess Mark Zuckerberg would count as well, even though I'm not a huge Facebook fan.

Having a history of depression and having made a couple of suicide attempts in the (now-distant) past, here are some things that come to mind while reading her argument that Aaronsw didn't exhibit the typical clinical markers of depression:<p>a) having a list of symptoms doesn't fully equip someone to make clinical decisions about their presence or absence, <i>especially</i> when one is trying to wrap one's head around them in the wake of a tragic event. Psychiatry is nowhere near being an exact science, but a list of symptoms doesn't put one the same plane as a psychiatrist who is familiar with the terms of art, statistical methods and so forth that go into the development of evaluation scales. Psychiatry may grope its way through the dark, but it does attempt to do so in a systematic fashion.<p>b) one might argue that the 'the Aaron she knew' didn't exhibit the typical symptoms of exhaustion either.<p>c) depression isn't some amorphous thing that follows one around like a personal raincloud independent of circumstances, but is rather a factor that weights a person's thought processes to varying degrees depending on time and context. Phrases such as 'pessimistic arrogance' loom large to me, as does this example:<p><i>Sam gave Aaron a quick overview of Australian politics; Aaron expressed astonishment at how easy it would be to take over Australia, but concluded that a country of only 20 million probably wouldnt be worth it.<p>Self-esteem, needless to say, was definitely not Aarons problem.</i><p>Sometimes, statements tell you more about the person making them than the ostensible subject. This doesn't mean that the person is lying or concealing their feelings, but that those feelings are unconsciously attached to external subjects in order to give them an outlet. Arrogance is not a good proxy for self-esteem at all in my own case; quite the reverse.<p>d) What people tell you and what they do don't always match; sometimes they may conceal the truth about their feelings of activities for reasons ranging from embarrassment, to pessimism about the ability of others to understand, to not wishing to be a burden. When one is depressed, even other people's expressions of love and support can be exhausting to deal with and it may be preferable to avert them by cultivating an air of positivity. This isn't a case of dishonesty so much as trying to think oneself healthy again.<p>e) <i>profound capacity for pleasure in everyday life...finely honed aesthetic sense</i> Again, I don't find this incompatible with the presence of depression. The stars shine particularly brightly at night, so to speak.<p>There are a lot of factors that lead into a person's choice to commit suicide, and they're not IMHO amenable to simple binary decompositions. Just as the number of people with depression vastly exceeds the number of people who commit suicide, so does the number of people who are confronted with alarming legal burdens, both civil and criminal.<p>Please consider the points above as an attempt at supplementation rather than disputation.",1360023042

If men have a wider standard deviation from the norm, that means there are more criminals and morons among men than among women. I think that's consistent with everyday experience, and suggests that women are more likely to be mentally balanced and law-abiding. Public records support this conclusion.<p>It's all in how you look at it.

That is also supported by public records.<p>> Society is run by people at the edge of the bell curve ...<p>No, it isn't.

They don't because voters don't trust them. The last genuinely intelligent person who ran for U.S. president was Adlai Stevenson (in 1952 and 1956), but the voters rejected him largely because of his obvious intelligence.<p>Also, please, say ""fewer women"", not ""less women"".

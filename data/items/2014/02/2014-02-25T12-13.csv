It was for a LCD display module on a 68HC11 microcontroller probably in the mid 90s.  It was something like a 4x16 and you inevitably have to make some value judgements in your &quot;display a string&quot; subroutine about what to do when stuff doesn&#x27;t fit on a line.  It only had a quarter K of ram and not much more onboard eeprom so I never tried to display thousands of letters.  My eventual strategy was overwriting (keep it small and simple).<p>What do you do with a quarter K?  It was basically a very slow beamwidth analyzer for LEDs using a photodiode and a R/C servo.  So the 3 dB down aka half power beamwidth of this integrated LED and diffusion lens system measures as X degrees.  Kind of important if you&#x27;re making LED based signs.

7297116,comment,7294487,7296790,4,0,mjn,,,"I think that&#x27;s true within a field, yeah. But outside the <i>really</i> top conferences, stuff as famous as SIGGRAPH, my experience has been that publisher affiliation is given significant heuristic weight, especially when people slightly outside a field are evaluating a conference they aren&#x27;t personally familiar with (either researchers in other areas, or administrators/deans/etc.). A non-HCI researcher (even another CS researcher) might wonder, is this HCI conference I&#x27;ve never heard of any good? If it&#x27;s an ACM HCI conference, many people will automatically attribute to it some baseline level of credibility, while if it&#x27;s a completely independent conference, you start out more in the hole having to justify that this conference is legit. A top conference like SIGGRAPH could probably get away with not being ACM (though the ACM affiliation probably helps with deans/etc.), but more specialized, mid-tier conferences have a harder time going DIY.<p>I don&#x27;t think that should always be the decisive factor, just that it&#x27;s an issue. Last year I was proceedings chair of a conference that I did help move out of ACM, which it had been affiliated with and published with for the previous few years (<a href=""http://www.fdg2013.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fdg2013.org</a>). There were various reasons for it, one being that being ACM-affiliated imposes significant bureaucracy and some financial costs that have to be recouped in registration fees (they&#x27;re super-paranoid about the event insurance, for example). Another is that the conference is in a field (game studies, game AI, etc.) where we hope non-academics will also read the papers, and being open access would make that a lot easier. Being in the ACM Digital Library doesn&#x27;t prohibit authors from putting up non-paywalled PDFs on their own sites, but it does prevent there from being an official, centralized open-access proceedings. But I would say we did lose some previous participants as a result of the move. For some people, moving from &quot;an ACM conference, with proceedings archived in the ACM Digital Library&quot; to &quot;an independent conference, with proceedings published by the Society for the Advancement of the Science of Digital Games&quot; is a deal-breaker: they see it as a drop off in prestige, from something they can list on their CV and use for their tenure case to something they can&#x27;t. This varies completely based on university and field, of course, but a number of people told us losing the ACM publication was a big deal for them, and would lead them to publish elsewhere. One researcher from Brazil even said that his travel funding depends on the conference being sponsored by a major professional organization (IEEE/AAAI/ACM/etc.), so if we went independent he wouldn&#x27;t be able to come anymore. I still think it was the right move on balance, but I can see the situations some of these people are in as well.<p>There&#x27;s also a little bit of an archival question. The ACM DL will <i>probably</i> still exist in some form in 50 years. Will an independent conference&#x27;s archive still exist in 50 years? To tackle that question we&#x27;re investigating being archived by a new open-access archival initiative from the University of California (<a href=""http://escholarship.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org</a>). There&#x27;s a possibility this may also mollify some of the people upset about losing the &quot;ACM&quot; publisher line, since they could instead list a &quot;University of California&quot; publisher line, which is also a well-known institution. Another conference I&#x27;ve published in has taken that strategy, with the University of Michigan (<a href=""http://quod.lib.umich.edu/i/icmc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quod.lib.umich.edu/i/icmc/</a>). I think this might be an attractive way for conferences to keep the institutionally-archived cred while getting out of the paywall mess. However it does require <i>these</i> archives to then do some decent vetting so they don&#x27;t archive fake conferences and lose their credibility.",1393330826

Instead of going to businesses had you considered going to the county councils directly and expanding your service in partnership with them. Many councils provide this data already, albeit in a less accessible form, this could be where your service comes in.<p>Your 'Search for a School' feature doesn't currently work however 'List nearby schools' seems fine. Maybe add a directory listing as an alternative to just searching.<p>If you're planning on pushing this into production, wordpress may not be the best backend to build upon.<p>I'd also recommend you check out Mark Pilgrim's 'Dive into Accessibility', it's a fantastic resource that I'm sure you'll find useful. <a href=""http://diveintoaccessibility.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diveintoaccessibility.org/</a>",1309946365

2733185,comment,2732643,2733111,26,0,patio11,,,"So I'm working on a post about the psychology of owning a business versus the psychology of being an employee today, and this has been weighing on my mind.  Here's my thinking:<p>There is a particular, exact dollar value which gets you the perk Do Not Worry About Laundry Ever Again.  Google (presumably) doesn't have Google-branded dry cleaners on the premises, so this can be bought.  What $TECH_EMPLOYER is taking advantage of is that young twenty-somethings think the entire solution space is ""Do it yourself at the laundromat"" and that ""We'll do it for you"" is thus a magical, irreplaceable unicorn of a perk from a company who really understands their inability to handle domestic chores.<p>You can buy that perk.  In a high cost area like, I don't know, San Francisco, I think that it is highly likely that it costs less than $800.  Let me check my guesstimate with the Googles: yep, you can literally have someone come to your door every two weeks for the year, grab your bag o' stuff, and bring it right back to you when it is done, for less than that.<p>You might think ""But I have to actually arrange that.""  No, admin help is <i>also</i> a perk which can be purchased, and admin help is <i>incredibly cheap</i> because there is virtually <i>nothing</i> that a secretary can do in San Francisco that cannot also be done by a virtual assistant in the Philippines for ~$10 an hour.  (If for some reason that makes you uncomfortable, bump it up to $20 and now Nancy is a homemaker in Kansas.)<p>You could, after having a VA, send her an email saying ""Hey Nancy, price out options for laundry service and catering where I live.  I want to never worry about these things ever again after you handle them, except to pay.  By the way, I like salmon and iced cocoa."" and Nancy would come back in a day later with the number it would take to drown you in salmon and iced cocoa.  And it would cost far, far less than $20k.",1309946260

I proposed replacing our current system of paying people not to work by an alternate system in which the government gives people a guaranteed job that provides the bare minimum essentials to live.<p>Under my proposal, there are no starving children. At most, their parents have a lower social status because they live in government issued dormitories and wear government issue grey sweatsuits. This gives the parents a social incentive to get a job with <i>no deprivation</i>.<p>As for my comparison to India, adjusted for purchasing power, the top 5% of India are poorer than the bottom 5% in the US. This accords very well with my anecdotal observations. I have far more sympathy for the Indian professional working 8-10 hours/day + 2-3 hours commute (who still can't afford AC or a car, unlike the poor American) than I do for a poor American sitting on the couch watching Jerry Springer.<p><a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/the-haves-and-the-have-nots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/the-haves-and-t...</a>",1309945812

The problem is that taglines tend say very little, ""Love what you do"" is a great motto to live by  but does it tell me anything about your company, no. At worst you get enterprisy taglines like ""pursuing synergestic excellence"". I think companies, like people, should show who they are through their actions rather than telling others who they are.  Also, when you create a tagline you kinda limit yourself to ""being"" that, while if you actually do excellent things your brand will contain a host of different positive aspects.  The only proper uses of taglines I can think of is products where the tagline is descriptive in a way that the customer ""gets"" what they're about",1309945651

Finalizers have a few valid uses, which we'll cover later in this\n    item, but as a rule of thumb, you should avoid finalizers...\n\n    One of the shortcomings of finalizers is that there is no guarantee they'll\n    be executed promptly.  It can take an arbitrarily long time between\n    the time that an object becomes unreachable and the time that its finalizer\n    is executed. This means that you should never do anything time-critical in a\n    finalizers.  For example, it is a grave error to depend on a finalizer to\n    close files, because open file descriptors are a limited resource...\n\n    Not only does the language specification provide no guarantee that finalizers\n    will get executed promptly; it provides no guarantee that they'll get\n    executed at all. It is entirely possible, even likely, that a program\n    terminates without executing finalizers on some objects that are no longers\n    reachable. As a consequence, you should never depend on a finalizer to update\n    critical persistent state...\n\n    Oh, and one more thing: there is a severe performance penalty for using\n    finalizers.""\n</code></pre>\nWhy would anyone ever consider using a finalizer?",1309944372

Great, I don't have to go home just because I'm hungry. Fun at work? Great I don't need to go home, or go out, to meet my friends. Place to nap at work? Shower? Great - I can spend more time in the office.<p>The work-hard, play-hard mentality, appeals enormously to people who have no real reason to ever leave work. If all your daily chores are taken care off (free dry-cleaning, free food), and if your social needs are met at work, then you'll naturally spend more time there.<p>This life-style appeals less to me, 'cause I have a wife and kids to go home to, and a social life outside the office, and hobbies, and fixing-the-roof-when-it-leaks and stuff like that. But when I was 22 I had none of those things, and I would have thrown myself at an environment like this. Does it honestly matter if I'm making 10K or 20K a year less than I _could_ when I get all my (paltry) living expenses paid for? And the bragging rights over my peers are worth a LOT.<p>Is it a bubble? Well, it's a sign of supply and demand reaching the place where demand outstrips supply. Demand for employees, and also demand for investment-opportunities (by those with cash). That will inflate salaries, and lead to creative (read ""fun"") work environments.<p>Enjoy the good times, because as sure as nuts are nuts, the wheel will turn and the down-times will come again.

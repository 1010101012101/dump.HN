136592,comment,136067,136145,0,0,wheels,,,"I agree that databases seem boring.  I'd been using them for about 10 years before last year when I had to write significant parts of one.  Once I started getting under the hood I realized how interesting a lot of the database problems are.  Turns out, the geek factor is pretty high.  Problems like query optimization, fast multi-dimensional indexing, full text search and so on give a nice playground for CS mojo.  :-)<p>Per SQLite:  It is probably the simplest SQL database to learn.  However, I fear it might give a skewed perspective on SQL to someone just starting with it.  While it's fine for the simplest of applications, if you start building up complex queries, its performance is orders of magnitude worse than almost every other SQL DB, potentially leading one to falsely believe that such things were to be avoided.<p>I personally find MySQL to be user-friendly enough for starting off with.  Though, honestly SQL in general is one of those things that I'm glad to know, but find painfully inelegant.",1205473581

It seems to me like the more successful startups are coming from those who bring the company from idea to product completely from their own work.<p>I've heard arguments on both sides of the fence, and am curious what YC members have to say on the topic.",1205472572

In general, it's as fast or faster than it ever has been. You can also test your max theoretical throughput by running parallel GETs on the same piece of big file content (using a ""download accelerator"").<p>I suspect you're confusing perceived speed with actual speed. The web is much richer now (as you mentioned). Flash, Javascript, and CSS wreak havoc with rendering time. Browsing the web with anything less than a ~2 year old computer is going to feel a bit sluggish these days. Even with a modern computer it's not going to be as fast as the largely static web of the old days.",1205472127
136578,comment,136532,136534,0,0,skmurphy,,,"The challenge with the original wiki implementations using ""wiki markup"" are that it was hard to get non-engineering members of a team to use them (or at least contribute). WYSIWYG editing in the browser window changes this for the better.<p>The second key defect early wikis shared was a lack of contention management. When you are working against a deadline you need a contention management (e.g. file locking) scheme so that ""he who saves last saves best"" is avoided. I have seen this cause much unhappiness for projects when a wiki is used that allows ""forks"" in the history with two or three people editing the same base version with different results.",1205471963

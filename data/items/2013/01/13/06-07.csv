At the same time, the birth rate is not too high.<p>However, the internet has proven to be a very effective way of getting people to go to the polls, and you can target your campaigns much more specifically, so as to include young people and exclude the elderly (who don't use the internet much anyway).<p>This is an important thing to keep in mind in a country like America, which has relatively low voter turnout. Election engineering can make all the difference in the results, as we saw with the success of Obama's reelection campaign machine.",1358057159

These generations, as they age and take over the roles of the higher echelons of business and government, may prove more adaptable to an ever changing world.<p>But this may just be a dream",1358057011

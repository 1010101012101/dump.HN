Penalty for fucking up -- even modestly (like filing a day late) -- is $10,000 with surprisingly little mercy. Likely fees for preparing Form 5471 by someone who has a clue: $7k and up. No easy alternative except kill the corporation. Uncle Sam hates small business operating internationally.<p>2. If you are the sole member of the LLC the LLC is disregarded and all of the income flows to Schedule C. Haha :-/ you will pay self employment tax on your profit. If you&#x27;re doing well the combined tax load will exceed 50%. Uncle Sam hates the self employed. If your LLC is owned by the Canadian corporation you are well and truly fucked. You have the Form 5471 problem. You also have to file a corporate tax return in the USA for your Canadian corporation (Form 1120F) and submit its income earned in the USA via the LLC to US corporate income tax plus branch profits tax so the combined corporate tax rate will exceed 50%.<p>3. Finding competent experienced help in this area is extremely hard. When you find people they are extremely expensive.<p>4. Sorry for the bad news.<p>5. There are a shit ton of other forms to file. Eg when you created your Canadian corporation you should have filed Form 926 to report the capital contribution to the corporation. Moving ownership of IP from a domestic to foreign owner can cause taxation. Etc.<p>6. Again, sorry. My contact info is in my profile.

Readers already know &quot;X is a framework&quot; because it appears under the &quot;Frameworks&quot; heading: what is each framework good at?<p>More importantly, what isn&#x27;t it good at - for instance, some of the bigger frameworks are tricky to integrate if you don&#x27;t want to hand them control over the whole page.",1389970692
7076037,comment,7074307,7075744,7,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>These new tools and frameworks are becoming numerous and popular precisely because for large, complicated front-end applications you can&#x27;t just get away with using &quot;plain JS with Jquery&quot; without it becoming an unmaintainable mess and writing boilerplate DOM manipulation code all over the place.</i><p>That&#x27;s a rather negative view, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s entirely realistic. I am involved with multiple long-running web projects that have been using things like (real) MVC architectures and single-page applications since long before any of these trendy JS frameworks existed. The projects have been built using sound software development principles and usually a small number of carefully chosen supporting tools and libraries. They are still doing their jobs just fine, and they have stood the test of time in terms of maintainability.<p><i>The only people I meet who have an aversion to these modern JS frameworks are front-end devs who refuse to learn them or server-side devs who hate javascript.</i><p>Please consider that there is at least one more option, which I imagine applies to many of the older readers here. Some of us have seen before the rapid evolution of an ecosystem as a programming language takes off, and we simply don&#x27;t buy the hype.<p>We saw the arrival of Java, with all its garbage collected wonder. Then we saw the nightmarish descent into over-engineered hell that followed.<p>We saw the arrival of Boost for C++ and the potential of community-developed, peer-reviewed libraries. Then we noticed that in 2014, C++ still doesn&#x27;t even have basic features for working with filesystems or rendering a simple UI as standard.<p>We saw the evolution of very dynamic &quot;scripting&quot; languages like Python and Ruby into widely used server-side languages for real applications. Then we saw people trying to maintain those applications a few years later, when they weren&#x27;t prototypes any more and when quality and performance mattered.<p>More recently, we&#x27;ve seen front-end web development shift toward JavaScript and move away from the likes of ActiveX controls, Flash plug-ins and Java applets, as language support became more consistent across browsers and some real effort went into improving performance. Today we are also seeing the inevitable explosion of the surrounding ecosystem as JS becomes a tool for building more heavyweight software, signalled by the arrival of vast numbers of different automation tools and libraries and frameworks.<p>But with the cynicism of the industry veteran, we also see that many of these new tools will do 80% of a job easily but make the last 20% much more painful. We know that some are merely short cuts aimed at people who now work in front-end development but whose backgrounds aren&#x27;t necessarily in programming and who haven&#x27;t yet developed their general software development skills in that way; there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, of course, but such tools have no (or negative) value to those who have moved beyond the level where they are helpful. Most of all, we know that five years from now, as the ecosystem evolves standards and consolidates, it is highly unlikely that most of the currently trendy tools will still be as effective and well maintained as they are today, but that like the five-year-old projects some of us work with today, someone will still have to maintain those projects after all the hypesters have moved on.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that we somehow refuse to learn new technologies. It just means that if I can see what looks like a fire, and it feels as warm as I expect when I get close enough to examine it, I&#x27;m not still going to jump in for a few minutes just to see if it&#x27;s really as hot as it looks because I read on a web site somewhere that all the cool kids were doing it.<p>Now get off my lawn. :-)",1389970692

Magento 2 offers the same feature set as Magento 1. You&#x27;ll just need to pay a developer to migrate all your 1.x extensions to 2.x, since there is no upgrade path.<p>But the community cost of everyone moving to Magento 2.0 ranges in the $USD 1 billion. This is how developers keep themselves employed: by regularly clusterfucking your code. A developer focus on Magento 2.0 gives us jQuery, OWASP security policies, faster product imports, better performance and less CSS. But it does nothing to advance merchant&#x27;s needs. Magento is missing a most important suite of marketing and sales automation tools.<p>Here is some features online merchants really dream about:<p>built-in A/B testing;\nintegrated social media ROI tracking (e.g. SumAll statistics);\nsales automation tools: abandoned cart reports, automated follow-up emails, automated payment reminders;\nconsumer behavior profiling to live-target marketing efforts based on behavior;\ncustomer persona segmentation such as &quot;single men / mothers with children / affluent customers&quot;, to increase marketing effectiveness;\neasy-to-use multi-site and multilingual installations (Magento is cumbersome);\nhelpdesk ticketing system, built-in live chat;\nbuilt-in onestepcheckout;\nautomated SEO using artificial intelligence;\nscheduled product imports to update product prices, stock, images attributes - including the ability to create new products and disable out-of-stock products;\nautomatic product categorization based on product description content;\nsocial ecommerce (&quot;share this product&quot; with product landing pages for Facebook/Twitter);\nclever discounts such as bundled product discounts: &quot;buy A+B together, get 5% discount on B&quot;;\nbuilt-in product XML/CSV exports for ciao, kelkoo, thefind, google and so forth;\nbuilt-in newsletter or at the very least built-in Mailchimp support (with automatic setup);\nNone of the above features are going to be implemented in Magento 2.0. What is the incentive to move to Magento 2.0? There is none. Do merchants really need the latest gimmicky &quot;html5&quot; technology? Mercahnts need a suite of sales and marketing tools that help drive their business.<p>So again, like before Magento, there is a huge market potential for ecommerce software that offers the right marketing tools. Magento is dead. But who will bridge the gap? Shopfiy? Wordpress Woocommerce? Drupal Commerce? Each of these new projects is gaining on Magento&#x27;s lead. My prediction is that Magento 1.x adoption has peaked and Magento 2.x adoption will never happen. Instead, The People will switch to far more advanced alternatives. Advanced in terms of marketing that is, not jQuery.",1389970154

I&#x27;ve been taking MOOC&#x27;s since the first round of Stanford courses in 2011, so I was excited to see this program develop just as I was applying to other graduate schools.<p>Admission for the first round was very limited to keep it manageable while they address any issues that come up early in the new program (and there have been a few, though nothing major). I think the original idea was to offer 6 classes and allow 100 students per class - 600 total. But only 5 classes ended up being offered, and the total acceptance was lowered further as students will take more than one class at a time. Within a few semesters they intend to accept anyone who meets the qualifications, with no regard to class size.<p>Regarding the cost, it is in fact revolutionary for US residents. My bill for the one class I&#x27;m taking was $700 ($400 in flat fees and $100 per credit hour). My next choice of school was NC State which would have cost several times that even though I&#x27;m an NC resident. A good out of state school, even a public one, would have likely been unaffordable to me. At this rate my employer&#x27;s limited education reimbursement program will cover the entire cost of my degree with GaTech.",1389969269

7075859,comment,7075537,7075537,27,0,visakanv,,,"I relate to this, too. Here&#x27;s some stuff that I read recently that helped me a little:<p>&quot;When you are young, beginning new projects is easy and finishing them is hard. As you grow older, beginnings get harder, but finishing gets easier. At least, that has been my experience. I think it is true of anyone of at least average intelligence, creativity and emotional resilience. The reason is simple.<p>When you are young, the possibilities ahead of you, and the time available to explore them, seem nearly infinite. When you try to start something, the energizing creative phase, (which comes with internal brain-chemistry rewards on a fast feedback-loop), gives way to exhausting detail-oriented work, maintenance work, and unsatisfying overhead work. You need to get through these to bank distant external rewards (money and such) that only come with completion. It is then that you are most vulnerable to the allure of exciting new beginnings. So you abandon things halfway. You bank the internal rewards of beginning, but not the external rewards of finishing.<p>But with age, this changes.<p>As you grow older, the history of a few completed projects and many abandoned ones in your past starts to loom oppressively in your memory. The early internal rewards of many beginnings are now a distant memory that offer no pleasure in the present. The external rewards of completed projects, which tend to continue to yield dividends (such as completed degrees, financial rewards) loom larger all around you: wealth, strong relationships and perhaps most importantly, an earned ability to see the world differently as the result of having been through many completions.<p>When a new opportunity opens up at 35, you evaluate it differently than you did at 25. You are able to estimate how long it will take, what the journey will feel like, what the early pleasure and distant pain will feel like, and what getting it done will feel like. You are able to react psychologically to the whole prospect in the form of a narrative that extends beyond the finish line, as a systematic leveling-up of your life. You see the transient pleasures of beginnings diminish to nothing in the far future and the enduring rewards of finishing as a steady source of dividends extending out beyond the horizon.&quot;<p>- <a href""http://www.tempobook.com/2014/01/13/when-finishing-is-easier-than-startin"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.tempobook.com/2014/01/13/when-finishing-is-easier...</a>",1389968685

I&#x27;ve got a toy language that I&#x27;ve been working on that uses a rope to store characters internally.<p>Everything works on &quot;logical characters&quot; - arbitrary vectors of codepoints, as you say. There&#x27;s still a number of edge cases I have yet to work out as to what exactly is considered a character, though. (I just added support for a single code point encoding multiple characters, for example.)<p>I&#x27;m not so sure that making thing reliant on a font would be the best way to solve that, though. I&#x27;d intuitively say that there should be less coupling between rendering choices and internal encoding than that.<p>The twist is that each node in the rope can only store characters of the same physical length in bytes (and same number of logical characters per physical character). This means that in the typical case (most characters require the same number of bytes to encode) it doesn&#x27;t add too too much overhead. Still not something I would consider as the base String type for a lower-level language, though.<p>There are a few simple optimizations that I have yet to do (encode smaller characters as what would be ordinarily be invalid longer encodings, if it makes sense (a single one-byte character in the middle of a bunch of two-byte characters, for example), that sort of thing.)<p>It seems to work fairly well, so far.

This is been known for a while, though not widely enough.<p>If at one time you connected to an open network, your devices continues to scan for that network. I can spoof that network, you connect to it, and then I intercept all traffic. A full framework has been created for this, complete with the ability to fingerprint your browser/OS and send exploits to your device [1]. Even if you only connect to password protected networks, it&#x27;s possible (without access to the real AP) to let your clients send parts of the EAPOL handshake, and then perform a bruteforce attack. Weak passwords are cracked, meaning I can again intercept all traffic and possibly exploit your device.<p>So you only connect to one single network, strong password. Good. I can still track your MAC address. Even with one single device I can estimate the distance and the angle of your signal [2]. Hence I know your location, at all times. So you prevent MAC address tracking by using an identifier-free link layer protocol [3] (this doesn&#x27;t exist in practice, only researchers made a demo showing its possible). Though a lot better, even with such a system it&#x27;s possible to track the movement of devices purely based on the fingerprint of the physical WiFi signal [4].

One reason was to make it harder for people (particularly people from immigrant communities) to enter the legal profession. Another reason was to increase the prestige of the legal profession by turning it into a graduate degree program. This latter reason is also behind two later developments (making it standard for the law degree program to be 3 years, and rebranding the name of the degree from the traditional LLB (Bachelor of Laws) to the pretentious JD (Juris Doctor). The 3-year standardization was not fully in place until the mid-20th century, IINM, and the LLB->JD rebranding largely took place during the early post-WW2 era. The JD rebranding no doubt had something to do with the high prestige enjoyed by the medical profession by the mid-20th century.<p>As for why the bachelor&#x27;s degree is required for medical schools, I don&#x27;t know as much about that (I&#x27;m a lawyer and have studied the history of the US legal profession a bit). I suspect some of the reasons are the same (other than competition with the other profession, since I think the medical profession was the earlier mover here).<p>Edit: postwar -> post-WW2 as I realize most HN readers may not have grown up with that long-default US usage of &quot;postwar&quot;.",1389967602

The machines are expensive and made by a company with a large lobbyist-budget.<p>2.  The threat is over stated, these machines are overkill.<p>3.  The machines grant marginal-at-best security beyond traditional methods.<p>4.  The slow but steady psychological appeasement to being under closer and closer government scrutiny is a threat to democracy.<p>5.  The airlines and their terminals are not private enterprises, while the security and regulations are pure government entities.  Since TSA agents are government officials they ought to be bound by the constitution which protects against unreasonable search.  If Macy's was forcing people to get cavity searches to enter their store, I wouldn't have a problem with it, I just wouldn't shop there.   Being searched at an airport is a completely different situation than entering into a contract with a private party.<p>5a.  The risk factor being so blown out of proportion makes a virtual-strip search of an average no-record citizen unreasonable.",1288702748

1860217,comment,1859796,1860054,0,0,cletus,,,"A few days ago there was a post on HN about how economists solved the problem of having prisoners live that were shipped from the UK to Australia 200 years ago: by giving the right incentive (paying for live prisoners at the other end and not just how many you load on in England).<p>When voting is voluntary, certain groups are incentivized to encourage or discourage other groups from voting. This manifests itself as bribery, legitimate ""get out the vote"" efforts, making the process of voting difficult and so on.<p>Basically you've created an incentive for such practices by making voting voluntary. All of that goes away when voting is compulsory.<p>I'm reminded of the Spce Shuttle Challenger disaster in 2003. I saw a TV show about the investigation into that. After launch there was concern about the visible debris coming off the shuttle. The investigation afterwards showed that there was significant resistance within NASA to investigating that prior to re-entry. Certain people wanted to use satellite imagery to see if there was any damage to the shuttle. Other groups resisted.<p>The reason this was contentious was that such practices weren't required. The solution? The investigation resulted in NASA instituting a policy requiring such imagery be taken of all shuttle flights.<p>Once something is mandatory, all sorts of incentives (and the problems they create) simply go away.",1288702705

This is I believe because religion does not pay a big part in the Australian political system and our religious institutions don't tend to be hugely politically active.<p>The ALP (Australian Labor Party) are out ""Democrats"" (in the US sense; we had a Democrats party here that was something else and basically imploded 5+ years ago anyway). It has its roots in the union movement. The majority of ALP MPs (Members of Parliament, the House of Representatives, often called the Lower House) earned their stripes in the union movement, even now.<p>ALP support bears some correlation with being ""working class"" and lower socioeconomic position. Traditional supporters are deeply suspicious of anything that (allegedly) erodes ""worker's rights"" and of any conservative government.<p>On the right we have the Coalition, which is two parties: the Australian Liberal Party (don't mistake this with the US meaning of ""liberal"", they're conservative) and the National Party, which is much like the Liberals but only field candidates in rural seats and have a very rural focus.<p>Calling this a blue and white collar divide is largely accurate.<p>The Greens are very much on the left and, like the environmental movements in all developed nations, is largely supported by a young, discontent middle and upper classes. I say this not as a judgement but rather environmentalism is a luxury, meaning you see it in rich not poor countries.<p>The Greens are basically the ""ALP in waiting"" and deeply entrenched in university politics (meaning the kind of people who run in or care about student elections).",1288702285

There were no pivots or re-adjustments.   There weren't a lot of great data options at the time.   Most importantly,  if you launched half the fleet and then decided to re-tool for data support or something else,  you'd have partial and inconsistent coverage during that retooling and then you're data coverage would be partial and inconsistent.<p>The gamble was voice was good enough and  global coverage was a big enough seller that they'd re-coup the investment and become one of the largest telcos in the world and then by the time the birds died they'd launch next gen ones.

I just don't see how the company can effectively focus on one or the other in marketing and not cause problems for the other: If I create an ad for Chrome OS that implies running in a web browser OS is smarter, that would be a slight against Android, even if it is unrealistic to run Chrome OS on a mobile device; similarly, if I create an ad for Android saying that people should buy Android because there are 50 million apps (not yet, but just an example) then that might be a slight against Chrome OS which may have many fewer apps available in the Chrome OS Web Store ( <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore</a> ).",1288700750

For comparison that article also quotes that at the time the Times was pulling in £15m - £18m from on-line ad revenue.<p>Part of the reason for the difference is that The Guardian on-line audience is larger and generally more engaged than that of The Times.  Part of this is because The Guardian have been very forward thinking by newspaper standards in their use of the web, but it's also because they have a younger more technology aware audience than The Times which tends to be older.  There are ways of addressing this (for instance The Daily Mail on-line is a very different beast to it's paper version with a very different audience - one all pictures of pretty ladies in short skirts, the other righteous indignation at such moral outrages as pretty ladies in short skirts) but it's core following was always going to be harder to convert.<p>Also remember that subscription doesn't mean zero ad revenue.  The Financial Times gets just under £30m a year from advertising on-line despite being a subscription only service.

1860086,comment,1859796,1859796,0,0,joelmichael,,,"I vote and believe in voting, but this thread makes me think that most people haven't really thought through the philosophy behind voting. Those who feel that voting is an irrational sham are not going to care about your ""obligation,"" and you come off looking like a laughably naive jerk in condemning them for failing to do their civic duty. Mandatory voting is disagreeable for the same reason mandatory anything is: it uses force to make people do what they don't want to do, which reeks of tyranny. And arguably, society would be better off if only the intelligent and informed voted, so encouraging voting amongst the masses is downright malicious.<p>If you're being practical and are just trying to get a certain politician elected or ballot measure passed, then requesting that people vote within a demographic that is likely to vote in a predictable way (Democratic on HN, I'm sure) is duplicitous. You pretend you don't care what party people vote for, but anyone can tell that a ""Rock the Vote"" campaign on MTV is intended to get youth Democrat votes, or that bussing in impoverished people is intended to get Democrat votes. Never is the idea why people should vote actually explained, but that doesn't stop them from shaming those who don't. Republicans tend to be a little more frank as to who you should vote for and why.<p>Which is why I say, vote Meg Whitman, because the State of California is broke and she is more likely to contain the spending. Vote to legalize marijuana because it's high time people stopped being sent to jail for smoking pot. And if you're thinking of voting otherwise, I encourage you to stay home. Because a vote is not a moral obligation. It's a serious political act that changes the structure of society, and I would rather my preferred changes happen than that they be as democratic as possible.",1288700152

From what I recall, there was very little science at all to back up the theory that you catch the common cold from getting a chill.  At least to me, there doesn't seem to be a logical connection between the two.<p>The best reason I can think of is, when it is cold, everyone tends to spend more time indoors with the doors closed, giving a virus much more opportunity to spread amongst people.  Another theory had something to do with nasal linings drying up (?) in the winter, making one more susceptible to infection.<p>If the chill --> catching cold theory was correct, wouldn't it seem likely that when you get really cold, as in shivering your ass off uncontrollably, wouldn't you be extremely likely to catch a cold?  And I know anecdotally that that simply isn't true.<p>Is there even a reasonably logical physiological theory to backup the chill --> catch a cold theory, or is it simply an old wives tale?",1288699904

Bit of a random mix, but it is working pretty well for me.<p>My apps desktop GUI is done in QML (Qt declarative layer) with C++ extensions (custom widgets, performance sensitive aspects, things that QML does not yet support such as drag and drop). QML supports scripting in javascript to handle events. I also use Qt's WebKit widget to display HTML/CSS/JS content (both local and from the web) and Clojure for backend logic and server code. I use quite a number of Clojure libraries for a rich environment, including some distributed/clustering stuff. My C++ app embeds a JVM which can run Clojure locally, but I have it setup so you can connect to it running on a server too (I plan to let organisations run their own servers but also host servers myself for people to make use of, perhaps as part of a subscription). I'm trying to push as much of the GUI logic to QML/JS or HTML where I can and as much of the backend logic to Clojure, but there are bits that pretty much need to be done in C++ (eg due to interop with Qt/QML). I like writing Clojure code, so I try to do as much as I can with it. I dislike Javas GUI stuff though and love QML, so the GUI is stuck in Qt/QML :)<p>Not quite ready to give details of what the app does just yet, though at my current rate of development I should be soon.",1288699513

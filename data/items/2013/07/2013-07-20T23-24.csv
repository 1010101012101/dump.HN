6077095,comment,6076424,6076424,2,0,zhoutong,,,"I wonder if looking up the source is really necessary. I did some tests with Rails console just now. It seems that Ruby and Rails are handling the case quite logically.<p>&quot;3.days.ago&quot; at least by default is a TimeWithZone object in Rails.<p><pre><code>  3.days.ago.class
   => ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone
</code></pre>
And then the way Ruby iterates Range is through the &quot;succ&quot; method. So even this will give you a wall of errors:<p><pre><code>  (3.days.ago..2.days.ago).to_a
</code></pre>
Sending &quot;succ&quot; to a TimeWithZone object will print a warning because the method is deprecated. So basically a warning will show for every second in the range.<p>Calling .include? should be equivalent to .to_a.include? in effect.",1374364690

     immune reaction, call it 1 million.  (I&#x27;m too lazy to
     try to google the numbers myself.)
  2. You need some amount of immune cells of the various
     types to carry out the immune reaction which results in
     immunity, call it 10 million.
  3. You have a total of 1 trillion of these immune cells in
     your body.  (Once again, I&#x27;m making up the exact
     numbers.)
  4. So therefore, the capacity of the immune system is
     sufficient to deal with
     1 trillion / 10 million = 100,000 vaccines at once.
</code></pre>
Third, and most importantly, of course 10,000 vaccines at once is hyperbole, but it&#x27;s making a very important point.  The question wasn&#x27;t &quot;Should we give our childrens 1 vaccine or 10,000 vaccines?&quot;, it was a debate about whether a three-vaccine (or was it seven?) combo &quot;stressed&quot; the immune system too much.<p>Dr Offit&#x27;s point wasn&#x27;t &quot;Nah, let&#x27;s give them 10,000 vaccines!&quot;  It was that when you go from 1 vaccine to 7 vaccines, you&#x27;re increasing the load on your immune system from 0.01% to 0.07% and we&#x27;ve all got better things to worry about than that.",1374363910

6077018,comment,6075506,6076905,2,0,derefr,,,"> the barrier to translate from interactive brick tool -> hackable general purpose compute platform was a huge divide for 15 years<p>I&#x27;ll admit: back in the 90s, without the Internet, it was harder to bootstrap a programming environment on Windows (though in 1985 batch files weren&#x27;t all that bad, relatively speaking.) A lot of the time, though, you&#x27;d be learning to program <i>from</i> someone--a friend, or a teacher--and they&#x27;d give you a compiler on a floppy/CD. Programming books also came with compiler toolchains on disks in the jacket sleeve quite a bit of the time, if I recall (usually DJGPP.) I&#x27;m not quite sure how you&#x27;d be <i>learning</i> to program but stuck for the compiler part.<p>But I started really trying to learn to program in 2001, not 1985, and I had Internet access. By 2001, it didn&#x27;t matter what Microsoft was or wasn&#x27;t doing. I could download MinGW and code some C within an hour or two. You know what the hardest part of that process was? <i>Learning C.</i> The &quot;barrier&quot; of finding a C compiler on the Internet, downloading it, installing it, etc. was immaterial, even then. In fact, the biggest &quot;barrier&quot; was figuring out that the thing I should be looking for is called a &quot;C compiler&quot;!<p>But I didn&#x27;t necessarily need a C compiler at the time, really. If I had wanted to code VB, WSH was already on the machine. If I had wanted to code Javascript, IE would have let me. And if my copy of Windows came with Office, there was always VBA, too.[1]<p>Today, of course, it&#x27;s even easier. Ignoring the actively-didactic software like Shoes or Scratch or Squeak, you can just download Light Table and twenty seconds later be coding Clojure. Or Love2d and be making a game in Lua. Or you can code &quot;in the cloud&quot; in your browser without downloading anything, if you like.  Windows 8 ships with Powershell installable from the &quot;Programs and Features&quot; menu, I believe; and there are several compiler/IDE/whatevers in the Windows App Store.<p>In short, you can be programming as soon as you want to be. The hardest part of programming on any OS, for the <i>last</i> 15 years at least, has just been <i>wanting</i> to--and then putting up with all that rigorous, logical thinking.<p>>  a concern about space consumption about runtimes<p>I didn&#x27;t say anything about space consumption.<p>- Every package an OS includes in the base install is a package they have to security-audit, update, and support.<p>- Every base package is something a user could call in with a problem regarding, and so something customer service reps have to understand.<p>- Every base package is part of the OS&#x27;s attack surface.<p>- Every base package is something developers will presume to rely on to be part of the OS in the future, and so the OS maker will have to commit to supporting indefinitely for as long as they support the OS.[2]<p>- And every base package is something that other <i>internal</i> developers might build other components of the OS to rely on.<p>In short, there are good reasons to ship as <i>little</i> with your OS as you can, reasons that have nothing to do with the size of the resulting installation.[3]<p>---<p>[1] I once programmed a JRPG-style game as a PowerPoint presentation using slides for views and VBA for controllers. Not as bad as you&#x27;d think; worked a lot like Flash + ActionScript, with the same &quot;timeline&quot; concept, but without an actor model.<p>[2] If Microsoft shipped Windows with a VB4 IDE, there would be programs, even today, wanting to go in and diddle with that IDE over COM to &quot;programmatically&quot; generate another program. Microsoft still supports DDE in the OS in part because there were so many programs written that used it to diddle with Excel workbooks--and Excel is an <i>optional</i> package.<p>[2] Despite that, I should note that installing the latest Visual Studio takes something more like 10GB than 174MB. You don&#x27;t install Visual Studio on a computer you&#x27;re not going to use <i>for</i> Visual Studio, even if the DVD is laying right there. It&#x27;s not a &quot;freebie&quot; to give someone when setting up their computer, like Google Earth or VLC. It&#x27;s more like VMWare: it takes over your computer and puts hooks everywhere, because it needs to do things like trap segfaults and handle them itself, or test-install services nobody&#x27;s codesigned yet, etc.",1374363586

But I&#x27;ve been in the lucky position over the past while to see Space in action, and at this point I&#x27;m pretty confident that it will disrupt many areas, including DNS.<p>I haven&#x27;t done a good job of making my case. Talk is cheap, more Space code is coming.<p>But my point in general is that all of these formats can be described as premature optimization. Or perhaps, no longer necessary optimization.<p>The example you provided clearly illustrates that. Dollar signs, at signs, periods, parentheses and abbreviations galore. In my mind, the current state of things is ugly code. I can make sense of that. But someone off the street can&#x27;t make sense of that. In my mind, that is a problem. That is a <i>huge</i> problem.

After all, they work nicely with object-relational frameworks like ActiveRecord, they are sequential, and they are more &quot;human readable&quot;.  And then one day you have a subset of data that you need to migrate from one environment.  And when you try, you end up with some clashing records created in the target environment.  No big deal, you will just increment all of your sequential integers so that there are no clashes.  Oh wait, there are foreign keys - need to update those as well.  Which reminds me, what is going to happen when ids in the target system catch up the the ones imported.  OK we can change the sequence to cause it to start adding records after the one imported.  Hey, this is really kind of complicated.  There must be an easier way...<p>Hmmm... about those GUIDs?

Of course, the best prices and convenience (autoship) is available online, of course, plus, most stores offer additional 5-20% discounts. I can add a lot more examples of the various forms of vitamin E, B vitamins, vitamin D, vitamin K, folate/folic acid, vitamin A, etc. The formulation of the mass market brands are not only worse in terms of absorption, but are often harmful like folic acid and  vitamin A.

His subject was economics, but his spirit was literary.<p>That observation explains what is so unsatisfactory about Exit, Voice, and Loyalty. Hirschman thought that if those in charge reduced ordinary peoples right of Exit, then they would respond with more Voice.<p>That&#x27;s half true. Voice = Talk x Listen. When it gets harder to Exit, the trapped Talk more and the trappers Listen less. You could make a slogan out of it. &quot;Halve Exit, double Talk, double Voice.&quot;<p>But Hirschman wasn&#x27;t a mathematizer. It would not occur to him to factorise Voice into Talk x Listen. Thus he misses the opportunity to look around him and see the usual pattern: Halve Exit, double Talk, quarter Listen, halve Voice.<p>One also notices that Talk is a function of two variables: Exit and Listen. One Talks because ones Exit is blocked, but also because one thinks or at least hopes that some-one is listening. As Exit is reduced, those who should Listen become less inclined to bother. Those who should Talk are encouraged by the lack of Exit as an alternative, but also discouraged by not being listened to.<p>Mathematics is the language for these kinds of discussions. There are partial derivatives, of Talk with respect to Exit and Talk with respect to Listen. But Listen is a function of Exit. The basic model is Voice = Talk(Exit, Listen(Exit) x Listen(Exit). The distinction between the partial derivative of Talk with respect to Exit and the total derivative of Talk with respect to Exit (That is Talk(Exit, Listen(Exit)) wrt Exit) is easily made.<p>In the real world, as Exit rights are extinguished, the talkers complain for a while, until the listeners stop listening and then the talkers lapse into apathetic silence. Those of a mathematical bent can easily cloth such bones in an animating flesh of differential equations. The real world contains real problems and one can engage with them.<p>Those of a literary bent are not, of course, lost for words. This blinds them to the problem: it is not words that are needed.",1374362323

What IS desirable is having situations where I&#x27;m forced to converse with neighbors and live among them instead of separated from them.  It just might be nice to be in those situations.<p>The closest situation I can relate to is our heavy winters (where I live).  I don&#x27;t see half my neighbors all summer because we are cooped up inside, HOWEVER we have daily conversations in the winter as we&#x27;re all standing at the curb taking a breather from the heavy shoveling.",1374361620

You might argue that we know our neighbors MUCH less now because we don&#x27;t see them nearly as often.  Being forced out of our homes - in some cases to prevent ourselves from literally dying from the heat - may have made people closer and friendlier with one another.<p>Of course I don&#x27;t want to be in deadly heat - but I also wish I knew my neighbors betters, and for the anti-social, like myself, being forced to be around them may have helped.",1374361472

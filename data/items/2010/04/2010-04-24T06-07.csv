1290504,comment,1290397,1290473,0,0,nostrademons,,,"You could argue that what dynamic programming does isn't even really memoization in the sense that it's used in the Lisp/FP world.<p>Dynamic programming algorithms usually work from the bottom-up: you fill a table with the first stage of the algorithm, and then compute subsequent stages until you've converged on a solution.  Memoization almost always works from the top-down: you start with a naive recursive algorithm, and then store function call results in a hashtable or other data structure to avoid recomputing them.<p>They both involve avoiding recomputation by storing intermediate results in memory.  But saying that this makes them the same is sorta like saying that recursion and iteration are the same because they both use the program counter.",1272091961
1290503,comment,1290397,1290397,0,0,cloudkj,,,"The way I think about it, in the simplest form, dynamic programming essentially boils down to a way of solving a problem with overlapping subproblems and an optimal substructure. Memoization is a technique that can achieve similarly efficient results, but is more of an ""addendum"" to traditional recursive formulations to avoid the cost of solving overlapping subproblems. The two are related, but not quite the same.",1272091888

Most decent IDEs have code folding and quick search.<p>Also keep in mind that many elements in your website can have an average of 4-6 attributes. If you are using browser specific enhancements or hacks you can easily have more than 10 attributes for some of the elements. Now think about performing that dreaded horizontal scroll in your editor to find some of the attributes.<p>Let the IDE take care of abstracting away the actual file structure. Let your build process take care of minifying the css files.<p>Conventions are good in programming, but single-line css looks like a bit too extreme trade-off.",1272091594

One problem is that the information you provide may not be what you want to hide, but the information that could be inferred from it may be problematic for you.<p>For instance, what if some financial institution computes a credit score based on the profiles of the people you are connected with and makes you pay more for a loan because you have some friends with a bad credit rating?<p>What if health insurance providers sift through your data to find out about your lifestyle and adjust rates accordingly?<p>What if a potential employer or their HR service provider computes some kind of loyalty/reliability/risk score based on lifestyle data you provide?<p>What if none of that is possible based on your current facebook data but when facebook gets acquired in the future their datasets are combined with other data about you?<p>All of the conclusions drawn from such analyses may be completely wrong.

It's the design equivalent of cut-and-paste programmers.<p>Look at the reading list of a design class from your local community college.  You'll find introductory texts new and old, like ""Design Basics, 7th ed."" and ""The Art of Color and Design (1951),"" but they'll all cover the same things: line, direction, shape, size, texture, value, color, repetition, alternation, harmony, gradation, contrast, dominance, unity, balance, proportion.  Take the class and you'll do exercises that let you practice each one.<p>Learn layout and composition.  There are community college classes for that, too.  I have ""Editing by Design,"" a newspaper layout guide, and other newspaper layout books on my Amazon Wishlist.  Lay out text and design elements on paper.  Cartography is also good: it's information design and layout and presentation and art all together.<p>Learn copywriting.  Writing is design: the right word can explain a concept better than a big, shiny icon ever could.<p>Good web design is good design first, with accommodations made for low-resolution text, small viewports, backlighting, scrolling and pointers.  Just as with programming, you can't learn it just by reading about it: you have to practice it.<p>If you're in Austin, TX, come out to a design workshop.  I hold them every other week and we practice various elements of design (using the term broadly): <a href=""http://vi.to/workshop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vi.to/workshop/</a><p>If you're not, maybe there's something similar in your area.<p>Finally, I've recently come to believe that you're not a modern interaction or user experience designer unless you're testing your work.  As a programmer, you might understand this better than traditional designers.  UX designers aren't making art; it's not subjective.  Once you get past color and composition and layout and into interaction, there are objective purposes in what we do, and we can create testable hypotheses around our craft and see the results and tweak it.  A/B test your interactions.  A/B test your colors.  A/B test your layouts.",1272090736

Choose somethimg around 10-15 chars and use digits, caps, smalls, special. But do it in a way that it's easy to memorize. There is a plenty of papers on how to do this around the net. But in short (and very paranoid way to construct password):<p>1. Get a phrase that is meaningful (for you at least);<p>2. Get first letter of the first word, second letter of the second word, third from the third etc. If there is not fifth letter in fifth word - use last one;<p>3. Substitute some of the letters with look-alike digits or chars: A for 4, a for @, l for 1, e for 3, s for 5, g for 9 etc etc;<p>4. Make second, forth, eight (or first, third, fifth) chars uppercase (if they are letters);<p>5. Done.<p>It sounds complicated but it isn't. It's easy.

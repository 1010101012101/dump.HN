72537,comment,72512,72512,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, it depends on the idea. If it's something that would help you personally then go ahead and do it anyway. Even if the startup fails you'll have built a product that can help you. If you are trying to solve a problem that a bunch of other people have then you should also do it, but make sure you find one or two of the people that would actually use your product and get feedback from them.<p>There is little reason to not just go ahead and do it. Either way you'll learn something and it should be a rewarding experience.",1193327841

All those hours spent with HyperTalk and experimenting with layouts and process flow benefit me to this day. <p>If anybody else 'round these parts used to spend a lot of time with HyperCard, I'd be curious to hear their thoughts on how it has affected their current work, along with any whale tales of monster stacks.",1193327313

You absolutely must have total passion for your endeavor or you will fail.  Sounds like you're not quite there yet (prove me wrong).  When you are, it will be impossible for you to resist going for it.  Age is irrelevant.  Having a co-founder is good, but not mandatory.  Having something that you MUST do is the key.  When you do, get going, and let us know.  Good luck.

I wanted to point out that C programmers, as a group, are getting things done. <p>I suspect there aren't that many of them, there are fewer people programming C these days as compared to Java or C#. But they produce spectacular number of open source products we all use.<p>Respect them for that. That's all.",1193326773

An ordered collection of anything.<p>""Linked list"" is not an abstraction (at least, not in Python), it's an implementation detail. And IIRC, Python lists are not actually implemented as linked cells, so they have different performance characteristics.",1193324801
72520,comment,72291,72418,0,0,gigamon,,,"DocSavage, thank you for your comment.<p>I am not familar with Levin's book and the context of his statement.  But my experience with rolling assets into a C-Corp is very straightforward.  Forget for a minute whether the original entity is LLC or S-Corp.  Let say a lone entrepreneur has been laboring over some intellectual property and he is ready to get funding.  Before he takes the VC money, his lawyer will create a C-Corp which initially has no value, it will acquire the asset from the entrepreneur in exchange for 100% of the C-Corp (which also has no value).  That is a tax-free transfer.  Then the C-Corp will issue preferred stock in exchange for the VC money (say 25% of the company in exchange for $5M), all the time encapsulating the asset of the entrepreneur and not subjecting him/her to any tax consequences even though on paper his/her asset is now worth $15M (since he owns 75% of the company).  And it makes no difference whether the asset was originally owned by a S-Corp, LLC or just a sole propriatership.  The key here is that when the tranfer was taking place, the C-Corp was just a shell and had no value.  I hope this helps.<p>--Denny--",1193324771
72519,comment,72115,72516,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"We are very close to agreement. There's hard work in picking the best and most competitive business processes, and it's going to be different for every organization.<p>That's why ""project management software"" isn't the same as ""software to help us plan and control building and deploying industrial power transformers in a union environment where we have high governmental reporting obligations"" or some such. Companies either want to sell generic products with feature bloat all over the place, or home-grown shops try to take fragile systems and glue them together with more and more code. Either way you end up with a lot more complexity than the organization needs.<p>
But it still might not be a simple answer. And nobody wants to do the work of figuring out what the minimum amount of complexity is for each situation. (Even though there's probably more money in that than anything else)",1193324761

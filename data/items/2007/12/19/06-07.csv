At all. <p>Doing the patent search won't get you sued, but if you <i>are</i> sued and they win, the fact that you did the search means that they can hit you for triple damages.<p>I've leave the ""you can't patent ideas"" piece alone here because I think that is semantics.",1198047163
91051,comment,90876,90876,0,0,altano,,,"How ridiculous.  He presents a very simple, easy to read recursive function as the solution, but claims ""This is risky: what if someone redefines or deletes the method? Can it be done without defining any methods, to prevent this problem?""<p>He then provides a much larger, incredibly harder to understand YCombinator method and mixes it into the Object class.  How is that not a method with the same downsides as the recursive one?<p>This is why I still have no idea what the ycombinator is... every explanation is as inane as this one.  Does anyone have a simple explanation of it, where either (a) the ycombinator solves a problem more simply or (b) the ycombinator is the only tool to solve a problem ?",1198047145

91049,comment,90978,91016,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Are you crazy? The safes didn't provide security sufficient to keep spies out - some didn't even have the codes set to anything other than the default. Feynman strengthened the whole system. Most of the safe cracking was done in order to provide access for the <i>owners</i> of said safes. His activities were quite well known: would you presume to advise the corrections department at Los Alamos to hang their scientists leading their technical divisions?<p>Additionally, he kept Oak Ridge from blowing up when he noticed the water moderated uranium was stored closely enough to be near-critical. Were he hanged, there would have been hundreds of direct deaths, and the entire effort would have been held up for months: they kept all their enriching equipment there, not to mention that it housed their enrichment experts.",1198046830

91046,comment,90789,91038,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Yeah, that is good advice. I'd do it if I cared at all about what was on them. They're just part of the ""long tail"" of hardware, long migrated off of. Now we just let them run for the novelty of saying, ""look its been up for YEARS!"" One does a webcam of the server room.<p>As a side note, every single production server we now use is a vmware instance... how do you count uptime there as it gets passed around various physical machines?",1198046274

Boot sector demagnetization was one. I think they had problems with drives that could spin, but failed in such a way they couldn't start spinning.<p>Really, you should <i>consider</i> power cycling every 90 days or so, just to make sure you can restart. at least use several different brands of HD in your raid arrays.",1198044435

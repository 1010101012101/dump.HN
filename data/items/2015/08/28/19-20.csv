Go on glassdoor and compare how much mid-level designers at agencies make compared to tech companies. It&#x27;s close to double. As an aside, #7 is really rich. There are tons of design firms out there who utilize of 1099 designers (some with masters degrees!) who gross less than 38K a year for full-time work. Mike&#x27;s Mule isn&#x27;t one of those companies, but the design industry isn&#x27;t without it&#x27;s own 1099 abuses.<p>2) The startup world requires &quot;product designers&quot; who have a specific set of design skills that agencies aren&#x27;t well equipped to provide. Namely- ongoing data-driven product development (as opposed to &quot;Just enough research&quot;), systemized/componentized view of design (as opposed to &quot;The customer is always right/Take what I have created for you or I&#x27;ll walk like Saul Bass&quot;), and a more collaborative &quot;agile&quot; workflow (As opposed to waterfall). Based on my experience as an engineer working with agencies, they are reluctant to allow their designers to directly interact with engineering teams -- we always had a PM or an senior designer (who wasn&#x27;t on our project) act as this mediator, putting us in a time-boxed meeting when in reality we just needed to sit down with 1 designer and just work through a few issues over <1 hour.<p>Because of this, agencies aren&#x27;t just losing talent: They&#x27;re also losing potential clients. Startups tend to prefer tight-knit product teams, where the designer is (or at the very least SHOULD BE!) a major component.",1440791555

10137483,comment,10134842,10134842,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Very, well-designed separation kernel. The main competitors in this space are LynxSecure, VxWorks MILS, and PikeOS. There&#x27;s others but all of these target security. The advantage of a separation kernel is it (a) has tiny attack surface; (b) is efficient, eg cache-friendly; (c) is easy to analyse; (d) has necessary features for isolation, mediation of communication, & covert channel suppression. INTEGRITY-178B&#x27;s EAL6 evaluation against SKPP means it went through around two years of analysis, testing, and pen testing by an evaluator plus NSA. Within <i>the evaluated portion/usage</i>, it should do exactly what it says and with high security. Still gotta protect under and around that.<p>Contrary to acveilleux&#x27;s claim, the separation kernels can be used for all kinds of things much like the security kernels before them. Security kernels were used in thin clients, UNIX clones, VPN&#x27;s, mail guards, web servers, file storage, embedded systems, a Scheme implementation, and so on. If Scheme isn&#x27;t flexible, I don&#x27;t know what is. ;) The separation kernels do similar isolation and have been used to do most of the above. A recent addition is virtualization of Windows and Linux desktops, which is supported by every commercial kernel. Dell Consolidated Client is one implementation using INTEGRITY-178B backed by their INTEGRITY Global Security company that markets it. Only gripe with Green Hills is their marketing department is so full of shit that I&#x27;ve had to bust them out plenty of times.<p>Note: Kleidermacher et al actually wrote a book [1] on their approach to embedded design that many claimed to enjoy. Haven&#x27;t read it myself yet. Might help others trying to duplicate the good aspects. You can also find descriptions of their PHASE development methodology with Google.<p>Anyway, the other component that was critical to MILS or separation kernel models was the middleware: how the partitions interact. The kernel can enforce static flows of information. However, dynamic flows need another enforcer to identify them, optionally inspect traffic, and decide if it&#x27;s allowed. These end up using a single node as a message router/guard, guards on input within a partition, or partitions specifically designed as guards. Various tradeoffs in performance and security there. So, for dynamic systems, you typically need to secure isolation and at least part of middleware.<p>There&#x27;s hardware, firmware, and software methods to deal with many of the rests of the risks. It&#x27;s not uncommon seeing a combination of a separation kernel like INTEGRITY-178B with custom, rigorously-built drivers and apps on a carefully chosen Ada runtime. Holistic approaches are still best for risk reduction even with strong isolation of a separation kernel.<p>Far as open-source and general-purpose, closest things to this are the Genode Architecture [2], Nizza Architecture [3], Muen Separation Kernel [4], and seL4 kernel [5]. Readiness, features, assurance, etc vary considerably. GenodeOS is most promising as they incorporate, rather than ignore, advances in INFOSEC research. They actually started out that way then incorporated similarly strong work (eg Nitpicker GUI). Anyone looking for a Masters or Ph.D project should look for fundamental flaws or improvements in their architecture along with submitting that back to team. Formal analysis or proof of it against invariants or known issues would be nice.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Systems-Security-Practical-Development/product-reviews/0123868866/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Systems-Security-Practical-De...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://http://genode.org/documentation/general-overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http://genode.org/documentation/general-overview/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://genode-labs.com/publications/mikro-sina-2005.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genode-labs.com/publications/mikro-sina-2005.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://muen.sk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://muen.sk/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://sel4.systems/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sel4.systems/</a>",1440791167

Hopefully this becomes the canonical source for libraries.<p><i>Phoenix:</i> Rails popularized Ruby and became the framework of choice for quickly and pragmatically developing CRUD apps. Phoenix has Rails-like conventions in building an Elixir app and has built in support for websockets. This framework is built for today&#x27;s technology.<p><i>Syntax:</i> Coming from Ruby, the Elixir syntax is approachable and understandable.

Even hash-maps are frowned upon. The single most used structure I&#x27;ve seen in engines is the plain old array because of cache locality. Everything is pre-sorted, pre-looked-up and pre-crunched so the main use-case is a straightforward linear traversal with as little branches as possible. Also templates can greatly affect compilation times which are already horrible on projects of such magnitude.<p>On the last AAA game I worked on we had very tight memory constraints and running about a dozen threads. Almost all of them used the minimum stack size except for the main thread. There were still a lot of stack allocations, but only for very small temporary objects and when the call stack was known to be shallow. Using megabytes for stack sizes would consume a noticeable percentage of the available memory which was direly needed elsewhere.<p>I&#x27;ve seen one game using shared_ptr and it was far from being great. There&#x27;s a big overhead to it when compared to custom allocators. You can&#x27;t easily optimize for cache locality with shared_ptr (as far as I know!) and working around enable_shared_from_this can be a real pain. With custom allocators you can easily optimize according to the use-cases.<p>Finally, templates are required to know their type at compile time, which for things like allocators is just not possible in many cases. For example, we used a bump-the-pointer allocator for a frame&#x27;s temporary values which could be of any type but still needed cache locality. We also used a fixed-size allocator when avoiding memory fragmentation was more important than cache locality. Both would be impossible to do on anything but void*.",1440790631

I program in Ruby one of the biggest problems beginners make is not creating complex data structures where they are needed. Instead they pass around hashes of hashes of hashes. Why? Hashes are simple, they&#x27;re easy to understand and work with. Unfortunately this initial simplicity introduces unexpected complexity, things like deep dup and deep merge are now needed. Every part of your system must now know the hash structure you&#x27;re using and often reproduce logic in many places like dealing with optional keys that may be missing. By not isolating the complexity to one part of the app it must now be shared by the entire app. simple + simple !(always)=  simple.<p>If I had a time machine and could make one change in an open source project it would be to go back and remove the design choice of putting using hashes as internal config objects in Rails. It makes understanding all the possible edge cases almost impossible unless you&#x27;re really familiar with the project.<p>The second is the claim of speed that this &quot;simplicity&quot; buys you. I agree that functional programming is extremely fast when it&#x27;s parallelized and it&#x27;s extremely easy to make a functional program parallelizable. When we&#x27;re dealing with sequential tasks, mutating data is much faster than allocating new data structures. I think clojure helps with the speed of allocating new immutable structures by using copy on write strategies behind the scenes.<p>I think Rich is an extremely smart and very accomplished programmer. I think functional programming is really good at some things, I don&#x27;t feel like many people talk about the things it&#x27;s not good at.

But we will soon have an unmoderatable &quot;crypto 4chan&quot; built on blockchain technology that mechanically cannot be censored. Ethereum, Maidsafe, et al are building the infrastructure right now.<p>Government officials are concerned about this direction, as they should be. We will soon start seeing crypto-murder software that cannot be censored. Imagine Bitcoin, except instead of mining, you get paid to cache weaponized drones in remote locations so that they can do the blockchain&#x27;s bidding.<p>These are not science fiction fantasies, the infrastructure for this is planned to be completed within the next few years. We can laugh at congress for thinking there is some obvious way for them to backdoor PGP, but they have good reasons to be concerned.<p>You might argue that this is a separate issue from the simple cryptography issue that congress is debating. But in my mind they are parts of the emerging phenomenon of information tools which are impervious to physical violence. For the state, which derives its power from physical violence, the entire movement is an existential threat.<p>I&#x27;m actually more concerned about this issue than the whole &quot;AI superthreat&quot;. The kinds of tools the AIs would use to harm us will already be in the hands of bad people, long before the AIs wake up.<p>I am in no way suggesting these technologies are bad. People are already dying because they don&#x27;t have access to food, shelter, and healthcare, and I belive crypto-technologies will save far more lives that way—providing universal logistics support to all humans—than they will facilitate deaths.<p>But so far IT has been sufficiently insulated from the physical world that technology feels somewhat safe... A long weekend in Vegas with fun games and a lot of money to be made. No one is really dying because pets.com went awry. But that is changing. Robotics combined with blockchain technologies enable information systems that are very much &quot;of the world&quot; and yet are not subject to the same mechanics of control as humans are, due to them not needing food or physical safety. That&#x27;s not a smal change, it&#x27;s a huge one.<p>Sometimes I wonder if this jump won&#x27;t set us temporarily back towards a more totalitarian state. The obvious solution is to ban robotics and crypto, with a censorship regime like China has. I don&#x27;t know how many &quot;bad robots&quot; or &quot;bad blockchains&quot; would need to exist for that scenario to trigger with wide public support.<p>I honestly spend most of my time trying to solve problems with these technologies so I haven&#x27;t spent much time thinking about harm mitigation strategies. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s silly to have that conversation. And we should help congress to have the right conversation, not mock them for failing to understand a problem that, frankly, none of us really understands.",1440788675

Here&#x27;s how I see it: if an organism arose which had this &quot;death gene&quot; turned off, it would not adapt to sudden changes in the environment. It might be susceptible to a novel infectious agent which wipes out the whole species. Thus evolution tends to weed out immortal or very long-lived organisms.<p>Your prediction is right, but you&#x27;ve expressed the conclusion wrong: thus long-lived organisms are unlikely to persist, i.e. removing a single &quot;death gene&quot; only allows you to experience one of the many other forms of death. The species is never at risk because any potential cause of death is always present.<p>I believe that the current hypothesis is essentially that evolution does not need you around longer than it takes to produce and raise healthy offspring, and furthermore, it does not need you to reproduce beyond prime years when your offspring are likely to be healthiest. So genes having these effects are not selected for; furthermore because most genes have side-effects (e.g. sickle-cell anemia), they are likely selected against.<p>>Look at this scary graph (with a logarithmic y axis!):<p>><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz%E2%80%93Makeham_law_o.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz%E2%80%93Makeham_law_o...</a>.<p>>and then tell me that medical advances will do anything to make you live to 200<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we reach 150. &quot;Medical advances&quot; is a broadly-defined category. Indefinite extension is rather unlikely in the foreseeable future, though.",1440788572
10137298,comment,10134104,10135367,0,0,wtbob,,,"> Actually, the reason I use Ubuntu instead of Debian is that most language runtimes I use (python, for starters) were, for quite a few years, more up-to-date. Of course I could use unstable, but I&#x27;d much rather use Ubuntu&#x27;s LTS and security updates.<p>It&#x27;s almost definitely better to install stuff in /usr/local or in install-specific locations under /opt than to use either unstable or Ubuntu in production.<p>> Ubuntu takes all of that pain away<p>Yeah, but it replaces it with its own pain.  The days I bid farewell to Unity and GNOME were so happy…",1440788542

Yet diseases, accidents, and murder will still be there to cut life short to be sure.<p>I just think it&#x27;s odd that there&#x27;s a great many essays on the matter of death where people argue it&#x27;s preferable to accept it than to fight it even if it&#x27;s futile. I&#x27;d rather go out with a bang than a whimper. At least then I know I tried and I didn&#x27;t let death off too easy.",1440788434

That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t do it with Erlang, but Erlang does give some simple, yet very powerful tools for making developer&#x27;s life easier.<p>Without Erlang you have to work harder to get similar effects.

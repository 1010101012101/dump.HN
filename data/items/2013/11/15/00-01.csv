I appreciate that a lot of people would rather just not deal with the like of Stormfront, and simply pretend to themselves that people like that do not exist, and that those views are not held, but this is a harmful way of dealing with anti-social views.<p>Even if we argue that a real-name policy would totally kill off all hateful comments, we have to consider if this is even a good thing; hateful comments should be met with rational arguments that undermine them, and show them to be incorrect. If someone says &quot;all [people of some class] are evil&quot;, then one solution is to shame them into shutting up by linking their comment to their real name, but this just allows them to continue to think this way without ever hearing a dissenting opinion (I mean, they&#x27;re hardly likely to bring this up in public, are they?).<p>The internet has a wonderful power to throw people of contrasting views together, and get them to show each other how they think, and allow them to change their minds. The mere fact that this process may sometimes result in offense isn&#x27;t a good enough reason to stop it. If someone&#x27;s views offend you, then it is your duty to prove them wrong and -- if you cannot do so -- consider that your own views might be incorrect.<p>I know I&#x27;ve personally debated with others online and learned from the experience, and I also know that I&#x27;d never have done so were it the case that I would have had my real name linked to the views I was espousing. It strikes me as incredibly harmful for society in general to attempt to silence offensive speech, not only because it means that those who hold offensive opinions can never be proven wrong, but also because it means that unpopular, yet true, opinions have no platform to be proven right.",1384477015

This case is a great example where Google did something no startup would be able to get away with and fought a multi-year battle to make it work.<p>It&#x27;s hardly the only example, though. IBM did hard work to defend Linux against Microsoft and SCO&#x27;s attacks. Apple cracked the carriers&#x27; line against useful smartphones with unlimited data, 30% instead of 90% carrier cuts in app stores, and freedom from spyware and crapware; Jobs&#x27; sales pitch to AT&T was as big an innovation as any tech in the iPhone. Google fights for net neutrality, fair use, and free speech on the internet. All the big players were active in the effort to organize the users of the internet against SOPA, too.<p>But the big players can also be destructive. Smartphone patent wars are a danger and a disappointment. If the major players would turn their Washington efforts to our common best interests, we could have excluded software entirely from patent monopolies by now. It certainly would have saved them many billions to do the right thing. Instead they fight to a standstill in courts at great expense and leave startups endangered and exploited in their path.<p>So let&#x27;s hope for more of this in the future and tip our hats to Google and Judge Chin this time.",1384476805

6736969,comment,6736089,6736089,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"I am always paranoid when it comes to technology and money, and this will be no exception. BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) has been around for 2-3 years now, but I still consider it to be in it&#x27;s infancy. This is especially true when it comes to security. A quick Google Search produced two examples [1] and [2] of potential security flaws with BLE pairing and authentication, and I&#x27;m sure there are many more I&#x27;m not aware of. Building new payment technology based on new and cutting edge communication frameworks does sound exotic and cool. It&#x27;s probably one of those &quot;cool points&quot; that gets investors excited. But for the security minded folks out there, this is likely a red flag. Instead I see it as building payment related technology on an un-proven communication framework, and it just does not sound like a great idea. And it is because of this that I will probably never personally use something like Coin regardless of how useful it might be. All it takes is one person to create an effective exploit, and there goes both your money and your trust in the Service. In any event, good luck to Coin with this new Product, and I hope they prove me wrong.

Some stores (particularly big box stores -- Best Buy comes to mind) always ask to see the card and ID. If they do, it&#x27;s a showstopper for it to not be real. There&#x27;s NO WAY a store with that policy would let you buy something with an anonymous black &quot;card&quot;.<p>Not only does this scream &quot;FRAUD!&quot;, it almost certainly WILL be used for fraud, almost immediately on release. Think of how easy it would be to allow a server at a restaurant to &quot;steal&quot; someone&#x27;s card -- photo and a swipe, and POOF, you can use their card the next time you go somewhere that doesn&#x27;t look at the card. How long will it be before stores that DIDN&#x27;T ask to see it before start asking, and specifically disallowing the use of these fraud-enabling devices?<p>Regardless, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d risk getting to the point of purchase somewhere and finding out at that point they won&#x27;t accept my card. And I AM part of their target market: I probably have 8 cards in my wallet, maybe 10. It&#x27;s complicated, but they all have a unique need that makes me carry them.<p>I&#x27;d love to have something like this that &quot;just worked,&quot; but I doubt this would be it without orders of magnitude more education and many layers of security protection to prevent fraud -- probably enough layers to be an impediment to people actually signing up to use it (receiving physical mail being required to register a new card comes to mind).",1384476349

Sorry skimmers!&quot;<p>I&#x27;d like to hear more about how this card is designed not to allow skimmers to use it. My suspicion is that the app will, in fact, be easy enough for skimmers to hack so that they can put anyone&#x27;s card they want on it, turning it into a pocket skimmer for waiters or anyone who can get their hands on a customer&#x27;s card for a few seconds.<p>&quot;Q: What happens if I lose Echo? Is it secure?<p>A: Yes, Echo is secure. You can set Echo Card to lock down when out of range of your mobile app. &quot;<p>Again, more information would be nice. Is card data stored in encrypted form and decrypted only at the moment of use via a key provided by the app?  If so, are keys securely broadcast to the card?  Is card info uploaded to the echo card securely for that matter? This is important to ask, since you might wind up transmitting card data on a public channel repeatedly.<p>There are some pretty big cryptographic concerns here that are completely glossed over.

Needing to write a custom function to process data?

The recent version also brings read/write support to redis, so you have have your updates trigger redis to store new values, etc. Plus, being that it&#x27;s not controlled by Oracle, there&#x27;s much less a feeling of the community being held back; MySQL feels very much like Oracle&#x27;s tying one hand back, so that when you get to the size to need a &quot;real&quot; database, Oracle will gladly step in, at their standard consulting fees, of course.",1384476188

But that implementation does not need to be shipping on by default in a major browser like Chrome.<p>If Google would promote Dart mainly through dart2js, but not ship the Dart VM in Chrome, then I have no problem with that, and even the opposite - that would be quite cool, new languages are always nice to have. Then, if Dart catches on with developers in the industry, I think it would be very appropriate to discuss standardizing it. The momentum among developers, plus an existing VM that runs it even better, could be a compelling combination, and browser vendors could discuss that in a fair and open way.<p>But to ship the VM in Chrome far before any of that is a violation of the basic principles of the standards process. It sends the message that Google intends to use Chrome&#x27;s huge and growing market share to force the market to do what it wants, instead of following the standards process. Perhaps that is not what Google intends, but that is how it can appear.<p>For that reason, I think that shipping the VM in Chrome is counterproductive if Google wants to standardize it, since it antagonizes all the rest of the industry.<p>> But it is also not vaporware.<p>Sorry if I wasn&#x27;t clear, I never said anything to the contrary?

From said FAQ site (<a href=""https://onlycoin.com/support/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://onlycoin.com/support/faq/</a>)<p><pre><code>    Q. How do you figure that a Coin will last 2 years? What constitutes\n    normal usage?\n\n    A. Heres how we modeled typical usage. On a daily basis, we assume\n    youll toggle which card you want to use and swipe your Coin 10-20 times\n    a day. In addition, you may adjust which cards you want to store on your\n    Coin a few times a week. Initially when youre getting to know your Coin\n    you will likely be syncing often. Over time we find that most people\n    sync much less frequently once his or her cards are on a Coin. If you\n    swipe and sync more frequently on a consistent basis, your Coins\n    battery will drain more quickly.</code></pre>",1384475480

6736837,comment,6729941,6729941,1,0,dorfuss,,,"As a little kid I once asked my father &quot;how does the eye work&quot;. He brought me a picture in an encyclopedia showing a disection of an eye ball with all the parts being given their medical, technical names. But my thirst of knowledge was great so my father told me about Newton and light rays, the lenses and how they focus the image on the retina&#x27;s surface.<p>My thirst was not yet quenched, but my father didn&#x27;t know what else to say, and I grew unpatient. Later in life I learned that the image projecten on the retina is then turned into electric impulses that go to the brain, are converted into a state of your psyche and perceived as an image coming from your senses.<p>For me it&#x27;s a bit miraculous and divine how it happens. Back to your question: I don&#x27;t really think that there is an answer to it, because even if you take a single letter on your screen, all the voltage shifts that happen inside of the machine are very complex, multiple hardware elements take part in it, there is the graphics processor and the screen, the different memory parts and the operating system that manages everything. In such a complicated structure it is very hard to say what actually happens that you can see a group of pixels on your screen that represents a letter &quot;A&quot;. And even if you take a very simple microcontroller and a simple display there is quite a lot of operations going on inside, the data being stored, pushed through the arithmetic and logic unit, through the registers and so on. So there is no simple answer as the letter &quot;a&quot; is not a simple high voltage state in one single transistor, and even if you look at a really single byte or an electric impulse it probably does nothing at all.",1384474986

For two player games, the app uses the standard elo formula. For games with more than two players, it simply calculates the expected score as per a two player game  and then divides it by (num_players/2). For instance, a two player game with player A and B rated 1200 would result in a expected score of .5 for each player. In a four player game, the pair-wise expected score is calculated by averaging the opponents&#x27; ratings and then using a standard elo calculation. This is then divided by (4/2) to give the expected score. For those interested, I wrote a blog post where I go into more detail [2].<p>Although this is a pretty crude method, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with the results.  I run a Settlers of Catan league where 111 rated games have been played. Here&#x27;s a graph of all players who have played more than 5 games: <a href=""http://imgur.com/ZoICwNM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/ZoICwNM</a><p>Here&#x27;s the rating distribution: <a href=""http://imgur.com/Rot4zkF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/Rot4zkF</a><p>The current ratings for those in the graph above:<p>1185<p>1079<p>1067<p>1043<p>1001<p>991<p>975<p>973<p>937<p>928<p>916<p>912<p>906<p>854<p>Median: 974, Mean: 983<p>Overall, I think this algorithm produces more accurate ratings than many other multiplayer rating systems, including the one the official online Settlers of Catan site uses (I discuss this in my blog post). This algorithm does break down if there is a really large rating difference (i.e. 500+ points) between one player and the rest, but that&#x27;s a pretty unlikely scenario.<p>The source code is available on Github [3].

Let&#x27;s troubleshoot this ficticous problem on RDS:<p>Am I being affected by a noisy neighbor? Can&#x27;t tell; contact Amazon support.<p>Can I look at top to see if the load is high on the box, and potentially why? No. I can look at historical trends, but not with enough granularity or information to be useful.<p>Can I look at the disk iops to see if there&#x27;s any kind of problem there? No. Complete black box here; contact Amazon support.<p>Can I look at the slow log? Kind of. They&#x27;ll push the slow log data into the database for you to query, but then you can&#x27;t use tools to do aggregate tracking.<p>Pause for a moment for a quick MySQL RDS tip: pt-query-digest has a mode of operation that lets you do a processlist every 1/100th of a second and turn that into a pseudo slow log, which does work for RDS.<p><pre><code>    pt-query-digest --processlist h=10.0.0.1 --interval=0.01 --output slowlog > /tmp/fake_slowlog.out\n</code></pre>\nBack on track - so no real analysis of a historical slow log, without writing your own tools. Possible, but time consuming.<p>Can I kill queries? Yes, using a stored procedure. Can&#x27;t use any of the existing toolset around this (like pt-kill, which can help keep poorly written ad-hoc queries from getting out of hand).<p>So, after many hours swapping emails with Amazon support, we&#x27;ve determined that we&#x27;re actually spending a lot of time waiting on malloc mutexes. The internet says that using a non-default version of malloc will help with that - can I do that?<p>Nope. You&#x27;re stuck.<p>Other things you can&#x27;t do:<p>* Offsite backups that are in any form but MySQL dumps.<p>* Take advantage of new index types and compression support from TokuDB.<p>* Zero downtime failovers (We were able to help someone fake this; it was a PITA).<p>* Cross-region replication.<p>* Automated failovers using a reputable tool (MMM, MHA, etc).<p>* Access the error logs.<p>* Run multiple instances on one machine.<p>* Alter the disk elevator (hopefully they&#x27;re using something sane, like noop, but we&#x27;ll never know)<p>* Alter the kernel swappiness.<p>* Troubleshoot crashes.<p>* Monitor and alert on a machine&#x27;s vitals.<p>Now perhaps I&#x27;m just being a power-hungry admin, but these small things matter.

Install packages, install config files, start the DB, restore from a backup file, restart the DB, and you&#x27;re golden. If you&#x27;re particularly paranoid, set up the selinux contexts (I&#x27;d bet dollars to doughnuts that this isn&#x27;t done on RDS instances), and create a security group that limits access to only the 22 and 3306 ports to your application hosts, and set up individual users.<p>This is particularly simple when you use an orchestration tool; I recommend Ansible personally.",1384473766

Also, I have a bank account with PNC, and if I need to send money to a friend, all I need is their email address, and PNC sets up a transfer, and shoots them an email with a link and instructions for retrieving the money/depositing it into their (not necessarily PNC) bank account.  Also the whole cashing a check via taking a photo on my phone is a pretty awesome feature.",1384473731

This is, I think, how the Graal project does JavaScript and Ruby, and they get very good performance.",1384473660

Grades that aren&#x27;t normalized across institutions weighed heavily? Need recs from established professors who can slip in a good word for you?<p>Oh sorry, you were actually doing things that interested you, not necessarily things that would impress the right people. Oh sorry you took tons of hard classes at a prestigious institution and so have something less than 4.0. Oh sorry you hopped labs for a bit instead of staying with that boring CS guy that would&#x27;ve gotten you into any PhD program in America for 4 years. Oh sorry you spent a year or two out of college doing startup tech work without building credentials with other PhD grads but nevertheless solving research grade problems.<p>I&#x27;ve realized that the PhD admissions does not select candidates who actually want to do research. It selects candidates who want to be admitted into a PhD program. No thanks. I love science and math, and I love research, but I think the PhD application has been so harrowing for me, I won&#x27;t consider it again unless drastic changes are made.",1384473655

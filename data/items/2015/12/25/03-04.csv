But there are so many types of addition that that&#x27;s not really specific enough for a language definition. And adding 1 to INT_MAX? Well, you could interpret &quot;INT_MAX&quot; to indicate C code, and thus &quot;+&quot; to be C&#x27;s addition operator. In which case, it&#x27;s not integer addition, at least not the kind that basic math and English skills would suggest: Adding two positive integers is always defined (and also never gives a value lower than either of the two operands), very much unlike &quot;+&quot; for &quot;int&quot;s in C.<p>> There are architectures with normal integer add instructions that do not have twos-complement behavior. I&#x27;m just not aware of any such instructions on x86. Can you name one?<p>Sure, PADDSW, for example.

Therefore, it is misleading to cut off the y-axis for a bar chart, but not for a line chart so long as slopes are transformed proportionally. For line charts, it is generally best to constrain the y-axis such that change (keeping in mind the precision of the data) can be discerned. Of course, if zero happens to be meaningful, it could be illuminating to include and annotate it, just as you would any other relevant point of reference. However, in the case of the temperature chart, zero degrees fahrenheit is arbitrary. Ask yourself, why not zero degrees kelvin?<p>Agenda will show through.

The point I was trying to make is that if someone builds free software and intentionally limit support to a certain platform then people complaining about that doesn&#x27;t really make sense.<p>On the other hand if you care about your free software attracting more users (some of whom could be developers who help push the software forward for everyone&#x27;s benefit) then you should aim to target as many platforms as possible.  I think there&#x27;s a good correlation between successful open source products and the number of platforms they support.<p>Reading the blog and the comments (and the un-pulled GitHub pull request with changes to build under Windows) it seems the tone is that the developers aren&#x27;t strongly motivated to get this working on Windows.

I would imagine that, in a residential setting, roughly 100% of water consumed for purposes besides the external use that we&#x27;re trying to reduce then goes into the sewer.<p>So why don&#x27;t we just increase water prices and cut sewer prices equivalently? You&#x27;d expect the average consumer&#x27;s bill to go up only in proportion with the amount of externally used water that they &quot;waste&quot;. One potential complication might be for houses with septic tanks, but those are probably fairly uncommon in the area served by SFPUC. Perhaps, as a utility, they&#x27;re constrained to charge relative to their actual cost in those areas.<p>Edit: retric - thanks, that makes sense.

There are VGA to HDMI converters available for about $20-$30 that do the job surprisingly well.  There used to be a number of VGA -> digital chips available (TI TVP7002, etc) but they&#x27;ve all been EOL&#x27;d or NRND (Not recommended for new designs.)<p>For HDMI/DVI capture at this scale, the best option seems to be an FPGA based system.  There are several boards available that have the necessary hardware but are expensive (relative to a 1-port IP-KVM), power hungry, or large (or all of the above.)  The Digilent Zybo may have enough to pull it off (and has the ARM cores to boot) but is still a bit on the pricey / power hungry side.

If they download a virus, that&#x27;s somehow Apple&#x27;s fault for not developing a secure enough system.

The user&#x27;s freedom to run whatever software they want on the desktop is a powerful check against the walled garden &quot;app store&quot; model where a central group (i.e. Apple) is responsible for determining what you&#x27;re allowed to do.

Unfortunately, it seems iotop and iosnoop are broken unless I press this big red button that only experts can press to disable SIP, when all I want to do is a little system profiling. Maybe Activity Monitor has a scripting API I don&#x27;t know about. I&#x27;m just kind of annoyed by this, I would rather dual boot into Linux than having to restart into Recovery Mode to get basic IO profiling. I can understand that DTrace could be a privilege escalation risk, but maybe Apple has an official recommendation for how to properly use DTrace or an analogous API. `iostat` doesn&#x27;t cut it because I&#x27;m looking at a specific process which is run under my user.

We had prior experience of that (previous consulting for a major telco), but choose to not go that route. Those protocols are seriously overcomplicated (design by committee...) and the only benefit it would give us is interoperability - which is often important, but not for this project.<p>So call control, media stream and NAT punch-through protocols are entirely custom. Might sound crazy, but if I tell you the server is less than 3k lines of code, and was written in two weeks, maybe not so much?<p>The call control server is done in Erlang - turned out well so far as we&#x27;ve live-upgraded the servers several times without interrupting any calls. We use iOS apns VOIP notifications for notifying the other peer of the incoming call.<p>The UDP media stream is peer to peer and carries H.264 for video and AAC-ELD for audio. Since the app is iOS only we could take advantage of the built in hardware video decoder and audio libraries for that. Not to mention the patent licenses for those technologies that come bundled with iOS. We had to develop a jitter-buffer and audio-video syncing solution on top of that of course - that&#x27;s the most complicated part of the client side.<p>Edit: I should add that we do not support Symmetric/Carrier grade NAT traversal in this first version. Since it&#x27;s not possible to establish a direct peer-to-peer connection under such conditions we&#x27;ll need to add server side support for forwarding the media.

And one with a horrible syntax at that. If the &quot;code&quot; alone does not actually describe what the program is supposed to do, that &quot;configuration&quot; becomes part of the program (if the binary&#x27;s behaviour changes depending on whether you compile it with or without the &quot;configuration&quot;, it is obviously part of the code), and having parts of your program kindof &quot;out of band&quot; is about the worst idea ever for auditing and maintenance, and for general readability. Also, given that that part of your new language is not part of the C standard, say, you cannot use any C compiler to compile it. If you are lucky, you find another compiler that implements another new language based on C with a different syntax for the &quot;configuration&quot; that provides the same semantics, then you can start porting from your own new language to that compiler&#x27;s new language, and then maintain two implementations of that part of your code (erm, &quot;configuration&quot;).<p>If you want to create a new language with better semantics, better invent one with sane, in-band, syntax. If you want to write C ... well, then write C, C is turing complete, so you can express anything you need in it, and every (non-buggy) C compiler will understand it.<p>> My real expectation, though, is that your compiler would actually run through your source files interactively, asking you questions where it thinks things are vague and recording the answers in its hint files, only actually doing a compilation pass once all its questions have been answered.<p>I think that that can&#x27;t work. There are just so many places where it&#x27;s somewhere between extremely hard and impossible for a C compiler to prove that undefined behaviour cannot happen that you probably would need a dozen annotations for every line of your code. Plus, keeping track of how the recorded annotations map to the code after it has been modified is extremely fragile, so if you wanted to be sure, you&#x27;d have to answer all the questions for a source file again after any semantic change you make.",1451013024

I had no idea how often I restarted sentences, for example.<p>There's other stuff I want to see that should be even more interesting.  When it's replaying, I want to be able to see characters that make it into the final version in one color, and others in another.  Then I'll be able to tell when I'm writing well and when I'm writing badly.",1235630891

Certainly, it has given me a broader view of the world of computer science, which is edifying and has allowed me to speak intelligently with recruiters. It is also motivating me to do risky things (left a good job in finance to go back to grad school for CS, applying to Y Combinator this summer). Mostly, it has taught me that I am easily influenced by people I admire, and people I admire include entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers.<p>Basically, I am what your children will become if you allow them to read too much sci fi growing up.",1235630885

If someone learns most of their words from books, you can tell because they will use a word correctly but say it oddly. I'm wondering what causes someone to use a word correctly but spell it phonetically. Are we speaking more and writing less? Hard to believe, no?",1235630855

It happened with Amazon before Web 2.0, when everybody thought it was doomed to fail. I'd bet it happens with Facebook.<p>It deserved repeating, because I don't think some people get it: Friendster had a few users. Myspace had a lot. Facebook has every single college student and now it has every single high school student, and almost every person checks it at least once per day, and in the last 6 months it's been picking up in every demographic. Facebook is a part of life for those people, in a way that Twitter or Tumblr or Flickr or even a huge site like Youtube is not. It's not going down without a fight.",1235630449

However, after Google, there is no major search engine emergence. For SNS, maybe there will be a next Facebook, but the chance is much rare than before. In Orkut/Friendster era, not so many people daily live on social network. For now, everyone online knows SNS and Facebook. That is the most obvious barrier for new comers, people's custom.",1235629831

But what I’ve started to realize is that there’s a ""blogger penalty"" to the conversations I can have there.  No matter how hard I try to make people comfortable in saying anything to me the fact that it’s my blog still puts me in a perceived higher position in the conversation.<p>What Hacker News does for me is to give me an environment to debate where everyone is on equal ground.  Sure there are karma points but unless you go out of your way to look for them you won’t know who is at what level.  That puts the focus on ideas more than people and that is a great thing.<p>I still enjoy my blog and still post longer pieces to it.

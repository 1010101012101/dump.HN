Fuzed manages about a 3rd of these and ensures that they are up and traffic is rerouted in the event that the C code that constitutes our NL analysis crashes or consumes too much memory (it can), or a machine drops, or a nic crashes.<p>Fuzed is cool for this, and a big win for Powerset, because you can scale as you go, you can very nearly just drop more hardware in with practically no global configuration. Search Engines are a special case of websites because they have to scale very broad, very early.<p>But Fuzed is useful and usable from one box to hundreds, and it's idea for dynamic environments like EC2 where you need to stay very light on your feet to minimize cost. That's originally why I wrote it.",1212710365

210462,comment,210087,210291,0,0,lolb,,,"I didn't know Linda Gottfredson posted here.<p>IQ is a useful (if not especially real) measure, but less so than other measures, it is culture-specific, and it is hardly ""highly heritable""; Devlin et al. showed a while back that its narrow-sense heritability is about 35% at best, and most studies of IQ's heritability grossly overestimate it by failing to control for a multitude of environmental effects. And psychometricians don't seem to get how factor analysis renders their beloved general intelligence measure a tautology, so it's understandable why someone would regard their work as BS.<p>[Edit to add some of the ""cold hard facts about IQ"" that IQ pushers like the parent comment don't tell you: IQ's heritability varies with socioeconomic status from about 80% to virtually zero, and also increases with age, which makes any claim about IQ having a high heritability across the board extremely suspect.<p>Note also that despite the name, heritability isn't a measure of 'how genetic' a trait like IQ is; IQ pushers often take advantage of that misunderstanding. Heritability is merely a rough estimate of the ratio of a trait's variance explainable by genetics to the trait's total variance in a population; as such heritability varies between groups, between environments, and between times. It is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that a trait is 'genetic'.]",1212708887

I thought I'd explain how powerset uses it production for the main site.<p>Fuzed sits in front of processes that run Ruby, and are bound to PARC's parsing and grammar analysis libraries. These self-identify to the system and each report their own unique API (the services are heterogenous in both function and version).<p>Every time you fire a query at powerset, it is sent via JSON-RPC to the frontend of our internal fuzed instance, which then does query analysis before forwarding it to the part of the system that actually does search retrieval. For every one query fired at the powerset frontend, our fuzed cluster takes 2-3 hits, so it has to scale pretty well. So far it's performed admirably even under load.

If a lazy screenwriter wanted rhetoric for a 1920s eugenicist scorning a prominent critic, he could do worse than ""the myopic little nitpickers, people who scurry about seeking little bits of garbage in the fabric of science (and of course, there are such flaws everywhere), and when they find some scrap of rot, they squeak triumphantly and hold it high and declare that the science everywhere is similarly corrupt."" But wouldn't those words sound out of place in a defense of a successful theory like quantum mechanics or of the germ theory of disease?<p>Admittedly, those words are here in the mouth of a defender of the successful theory of natural selection. But he seems to be a sadly devolved specimen of the breed. Some years ago I read Darwin's reaction to Lord Kelvin's criticisms (in some webbed version of Origin of Species). Darwin just didn't declare victory because Darwin had assembled a ""rational synthesis"" and Kelvin had not: Darwin reacted as though addressing criticism on the details was important in and of itself.<p>(I myself tend to dismiss modern creationists, but certainly not because I think that details are unimportant compared to one's ""coherent picture on a scientific issue."" Details are very important, and one of my beefs with creationists is that they tend to be stubbornly spectacularly wrong on the details. E.g., ICR continues to misstate the second law of thermodynamics <a href=""http://www.icr.org/article/456/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icr.org/article/456/</a> . It is easy for evolution to be consistent with the second law, because so much entropy is carried by food and O2 and CO2, or by sunlight and IR. In that particular article, the main sleight of hand seems to be ignoring the outgoing IR.)",1212707229

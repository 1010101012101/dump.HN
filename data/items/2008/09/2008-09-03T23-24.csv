The only reason they wouldn't do it is if they are happy with what others are doing in the space - such as the eee PC. But Google wants it to be <i>cheaper</i>, because that means more users, which grows the internet market for google.<p>But as soon as google others aren't doing what would benefit google,

It actually looks like those are 3 separate posts, at least thats how tumblr's API is treating it.<p>As far as song names, its really tough to extract them, since people actually write content about the audio and its not always as straight forward as artist - track name. We make our best guess, but you can specify a title and track name using our tagging system. On the tumblr post, hit ""advanced"" and add a tag in this format ""tt:artist - track name"". That will take privilege over the text guess.<p>Thanks again. We really appreciate the feedback.",1220485570

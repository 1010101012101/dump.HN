9607624,comment,9606572,9607232,0,0,davnicwil,,,"> I also like the idea that relationships should be natural<p>I find this really interesting, as it&#x27;s a meme that I think most adults still share. I&#x27;m interpreting your use of &#x27;natural&#x27; as meaning something like &#x27;meeting someone by some degree of chance, in-person, in a scenario where finding a relationship is not, nominally at least, the primary reason for being there.<p>Looking to meet complete strangers on the internet with the intention of starting a relationship vs looking to meet complete strangers in-person, be that at a bar, work, night-class, sporting activity etc, with the same intention is fundamentally the same concept. Only the implementation details differ.<p>But there&#x27;s a big, obvious, cultural difference. I wonder if that difference stems from the fact that one cannot mask one&#x27;s ultimate intention when going the online route. In the in-person scenario, you always have the convenient social get-out that you were just there to enjoy whatever the activity is, and it&#x27;s just a happy coincidence that you happened to meet someone whilst doing it. It&#x27;s coy, relies on chance, and fits in with a traditionally romantic narrative.<p>With online dating, you admit straight up that your sole intention is to meet people and find a relationship - it&#x27;s therefore explicitly implied that there&#x27;s a degree of trial and error, and from the outset it&#x27;s acknowledged that it&#x27;s a numbers game with certain attributes - shared traits, hobbies, interests - feeding into a formula that defines whether or not we think a relationship is worth pursuing. I think it&#x27;s simply this directness, and this exposure, that&#x27;s seen as course and not fitting with our social/cultural model of how romance &#x27;should work&#x27;.<p>I wonder if it&#x27;ll always be this way? I&#x27;d propose that in the future it will be to some degree, but we&#x27;ll just be somewhere else on the curve. Perhaps with tomorrow&#x27;s dating services, we&#x27;ll look back on today&#x27;s online dating apps and view them as quite lo-fi and quaint - with their low-accuracy matching algorithms leaving so much to chance, making you do so much of the work, etc - i.e. just how we compare online dating vs meeting people in bars, today.<p>I guess we&#x27;ll see how that concept of a &#x27;naturally occurring relationship&#x27; evolves over time as societies and cultures shift.",1432673919

I am not persuaded that these features constitute either the ideas or rules of Tetris or are necessitated by game play.</i><p>Interesting that intuitive controls are typically not copyrightable, yet it sounds like intuitive UI elements are.<p>Also, it seems the rules for what is copyrightable are very different from what is patentable (see: slide to unlock). If Capcom had patented &quot;method of simulating fighting moves with an 8-way joystick&quot;, like it or not, I&#x27;m guessing things would have gone very differently.<p>> <i>The court also filtered out unprotectable game mechanics. Using a six-by-six game grid is not an expressive choice. “A grid that is too small would make the game trivial; a grid that is too large would make it pointless.”</i><p>I find this an interesting contrast with the fact that Tetris&#x27; tetrominoes are considered expression. As the blog points out, the game would be far too easy with triominoes but far too difficult with pentominoes. I don&#x27;t know that much about copyright law, but I wonder if that part of the Tetris decision just boils down to the opinion of that particular judge?",1432673875

9607618,comment,9605733,9605733,0,0,eridius,,,"Something this article largely ignores is that often you want to build the support for the presumptive feature now because the act of implementing it affects architectural decisions. It came close to this by saying<p>> <i>it does not apply to effort to make the software easier to modify</i><p>But there&#x27;s a difference between making software easier to modify (where the same effort could be expended later to retrofit the software) versus making architectural decisions. Often times trying to implement something teaches you that your architecture isn&#x27;t sufficient and you need to change it. If you can learn that while you&#x27;re building the original architecture, then you&#x27;ve avoided a potential <i>huge</i> amount of work later trying to retrofit it.<p>To use the example from the article, what if supporting piracy risks reveals that the fundamental design used for representing pricing decisions isn&#x27;t sufficient to model the piracy risks, and the whole thing needs to be reimplemented? If you can learn this while implementing the pricing in the first place, then you haven&#x27;t lost any time reimplementing. But if you defer the piracy risks by 4 months, and then discover that your pricing model needs to be re-done, now you need to throw away your previous work and start over, and now your 2-month feature is going to take 3 or 4 months instead.",1432673862

It also is mentioned that the Kubuntu leader has tried to raise a licensing issue with Ubuntu for some time but has not gotten a satisfactory reply, and so has continued to raise it.  The CC seems to be disinclined to discuss any future of Kubuntu which includes him as its elected leader.<p>Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with either Ubuntu or Kubuntu.

9607598,comment,9605870,9605870,0,0,graycat,,,"Early in my career, was at GE in
scientific/engineering software.  The unit
shrank, and I got laid off.<p>While still on my accrued vacation, sent
some resumes and in two weeks went on
seven interviews and got five offers.
Took the best offer, again in
scientific/engineering software, with a
nice raise and the next year another nice
raise.  Soon I was making in annual salary
six times what a new, high end Camaro
cost.<p>My wife was in her Ph.D. program in
essentially <i>mathematical sociology</i>, and
my career was getting much better.<p>I went for a Ph.D., and got it in some
applied math, stochastic optimal control
with some algorithms, software, etc.<p>My wife also got her Ph.D.<p>That was the good news.<p>After my Ph.D., my career was totally
shot.  I was nearly unemployable at
anything except academics which I did
<i>not</i> want -- I wanted make money, support
my wife and myself, buy a house, have and
support kids, etc.  The academics paid
less than I was making before my Ph.D.<p>Also my marriage was ruined:  The stress
of her Ph.D. work threw my wife
(Valedictorian, PBK, <i>Summa Cum Laude</i>,
Woodrow Wilson) into a clinical
depression.  She never recovered, and her
body was found floating in a lake near her
family farm where she was visiting trying
to recover.<p>Finally I ended up at the IBM Watson lab
in artificial intelligence.  I invented
some algorithms, wrote software, worked
with high end customers, published some
papers, and then IBM lost $16 billion in
three years, went from 405,000 employees
down to 209,000, and the Watson lab went
from 4500 down to 1500 with 500 of those
temporary, and I was out of work.  The guy
who walked me out the door was immediately
demoted out of management.  The guy two
levels up, with a corner office, 55
people, a budget, a secretary, was
<i>reorganized</i> to have one more level of
management between himself and the CEO,
given a six month performance plan, and
then demoted out of management.<p>Actually at IBM, due to the costs of
commuting, housing, etc., I lost money.
IBM never paid me enough to live and
commute, certainly not nearly enough to
buy a house and support a family.  I saved
money even in graduate school; at IBM I
lost.<p>Out of IBM, I was absolutely, totally,
permanently unemployable for, as far as I
could tell, anything at all, <i>anything</i>,
at least anything that would pay enough to
live and commute to work.  I sent 1000
resume copies and got back silence or
nothing.  Period.  I&#x27;m a native born US
citizen and have held security clearances
as high as Secret.  I&#x27;ve never been
arrested or charged with crime except for
minor traffic violations.  I&#x27;ve never been
in court.  Never used illegal drugs or
made illegal use of legal drugs.  Never
been intoxicated.  Am in good health.  I
have proven high aptitude, interest, and
accomplishments in STEM fields.  I&#x27;ve
written a lot of significant software.
Yet, I was treated like I had a felony
conviction.<p>But I could still do applied math and
write software.  I was good at several
programming languages, TCP/IP, lots of
applications, etc.  And I&#x27;d had enough
experience in business to see how it
worked.<p>So, I thought of a problem that maybe
nearly every Internet user would like to
have solved, derived some math for the
first good solution, drew out an
<i>architecture</i>, fast, reliable, and
scalable, for the software and server farm
to present the solution to users via a Web
site, and started writing the software, on
Windows in .NET, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, etc.
with Visual Basic .NET.<p>As of last Friday, I got all the planned
software running.<p>So, I have a few, small revisions, and
then will load some initial data, give a
critical review, do alpha and beta tests,
load some more initial data, plug together
a server, get Windows Server and SQL
Server from the Microsoft BizSpark
program, go live, get publicity, run ads,
and hopefully get users and revenue.<p>Advice:  ASAP do not be an employee.
Instead, start, own, and run a business.<p>Technology can be a big advantage, but for
technical topics, except for just a hobby,
say, mathematical physics, learn what you
need when you need it for your <i>business</i>
and otherwise strongly minimize the effort
you expend on learning, say, C, C++, Java,
JavaScript, Jquery, .NET, Web
<i>frameworks</i>, C#, Python, Ruby, etc.<p>For the business, get some barriers to
entry.<p>One of the very best approaches to
business is just something with a strong
geographical barrier to entry.  So, if
work hard and smart, actually can do okay,
say, support family, get kids through
college, have a good retirement, by doing
well running a few fast food restaurants,
a few gas and convenience stores, having
lots of crews mowing grass, running a <i>big
truck, little truck</i> business, say, in
auto parts, plumbing supplies, electrical
supplies, other industrial supplies,
running a good, local building materials
company, being a <i>manufacturer&#x27;s
representative</i>, running several pizza
shops, a popular Italian red sauce, family
restaurant, an auto repair shop, etc.<p>With such a business, when the kids are
old enough, can also get the wife and kids
involved, which can solve lots of serious
problems and be just terrific for the
family.  The business education and career
start the kids get helping in the family
business easily can be much better than
any Harvard or Stanford MBA.<p>A simple and not wrong way to look at STEM
field Ph.D. degrees is as a US Federal
Government supported labor supply for
highly speculative, leading edge parts of
US national security and not so much for
anything else.  Indeed, when my career was
doing well, mostly I was around DC working
on US DoD projects.<p>Mostly the US commercial world just
deeply, profoundly, bitterly hates and
despises the high end STEM work done
mostly for US national security.<p>Only for a short time just before I went
for a Ph.D. did I have money enough to buy
a house, but then I didn&#x27;t.  Since then
I&#x27;ve never had money enough to buy a house
and, thus, haven&#x27;t.  And, after our Ph.D.
degrees, my wife and I were never in a
position to have kids, so I never had any.<p>I owe my brother&#x27;s widow a major chunk of
change.<p>If my startup works, then I&#x27;ll be able to
pay back my brother&#x27;s widow plus a lot,
buy a house, etc.<p>Mostly I recommend, stay the heck out of
technology.<p>With some high irony, there&#x27;s a movie
<i>Stand and Deliver</i> about teaching
calculus to high school students in a
poor, Hispanic area of Los Angeles.  The
idea is that calculus can be their ticket
out of poverty.<p>Some of the evidence the teacher gives for
the value of calculus is to tour some Los
Angeles area aero-space firms -- right, US
DoD again.<p>At one point, a girl in the calculus class
is torn between working hard on calculus
or working in the successful, family
Mexican restaurant of her parents.<p>So, the calculus teacher goes to the
restaurant, talks to the owners and
parents of the girl, and claims that
calculus will help their daughter.<p>I know calculus, advanced calculus,
mathematical <i>analysis</i> well beyond, and
many important applications.  I&#x27;ve studied
calculus, taught it, applied it, and
published original research in it.  I know
calculus.<p>On the claim of the calculus teacher, that
is, calculus compared with the restaurant,
I call BS.  Total upchuckable, delusional,
wacko BS.<p>For that girl, on average, working in the
successful, family Mexican restaurant run
by her parents and, thus, <i>learning the
family business</i>, was by far, a wide
margin, much, <i>much</i> better for her
<i>education</i>, career, and life than
anything reasonable from calculus.<p>The girl&#x27;s parents were fully correct.
The calculus teacher was nuts.<p>In particular, the US Federal Government
doesn&#x27;t grant H1B visas for workers in
successful, family Mexican restaurants in
Los Angeles but does strongly fund US
college education in STEM fields.<p>In a STEM field, are essentially working
in a <i>market</i> run by the US DoD and funded
by the US Congress mostly only for US
national security.  So, it&#x27;s very much not
a <i>free</i> market.  Indeed, for a while the
US NSF had economists analyzing how many
immigrants the US should fund in STEM
field graduate programs to keep down the
labor cost to the US DoD.  It&#x27;s a
<i>managed</i> market, a <i>rigged</i> game.<p>For a career, you are better off running a
family restaurant or any of a long list of
other <i>ordinary</i> business opportunities.<p>But, if you are in technology, then maybe
you can do a project, sell it off for a
nice bundle, enough for you and your
family to be <i>fixed for life</i> -- if so,
then go for it.",1432673656

Likewise, packets: Get enough network applications and services going, and packet switched network just become YAM (yet another medium).<p>Scientists work at all levels, and some work to link the levels, but that is (and may always remain?) at best incomplete at this time.

9607459,comment,9606001,9606798,0,0,rmxt,,,"Thank you for the additional info. I am skeptical merely because they were quite hand-wavy about temperature accommodations, and it certainly is/was simplistic to think that ALL thermal movements can be accommodated for only at stations. (Especially if it&#x27;s a direct and exclusive SF-LA route) Yes, the cross-sectional properties of the tube are going to be phenomenal, but I&#x27;ve always operated under the assumption that you don&#x27;t try to resist thermal movements, regardless of the strength of the cross-section. You let them dissipate and design for the deflection (e.g., at the bearings and abutments), rather than the stress (buckling/tensile) in the beam. If we start allowing stress to develop in the superstructure tube, I can&#x27;t imagine what the cyclic fatigue impacts of that temperature stress will be. (Maybe it&#x27;s not significant...)<p>I am no rail expert (though I am a civil/structural guy), but even continuous welded rail isn&#x27;t always continuous for hundreds of miles. [1] I think that there are two factors at play: continuity in the maglev/rail structures, and continuity in the superstructure/tube. I do not know what maglev devices look like, but if they do look like traditional rail, then agreed that a CWR solution seems to be the way to go. That being said, no matter how stiff the tube is, it too will have to accommodate thermal movement. My gut reaction is to call everything tube related simply supported, allow for (6.5x10^-6x100ft.x100deg = 0.065 feet) ~= 0.75&quot; of expansion or contraction at each pier, and surround this expansion zone with a metal sleeve of 2&quot;+ greater diameter than the main tube. Simply supported, multi-span structures are a well-studied problem. Adding in the continuity of the rail/maglev structures are what make it hairy, IMO, and the interplay between seismic considerations and thermal considerations becomes important. As far as I can see, it&#x27;s very important for the maglev structures to be continuous to ensure for smoothness and speed of the ride.<p>For example, given that you make the superstructure spans simply supported, you have these nearly perfect &quot;mass-on-a-stick&quot; seismic models with well defined, and relatively short periods. Then, you have much longer continuous sections of rail/maglev equipment that contain releases on a far fewer number of span segments. These will have much longer periods of vibration. Maybe I&#x27;m stretching here, but the connections between the maglev/rail and superstructure seem like a place that is rife with potential for failure and stress during a seismic event. (I would not want a life-safety issue being my most prominent failure point.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=471152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=471152</a>",1432672386

9607449,comment,9606001,9606504,0,0,brenschluss,,,"> These cultural dependencies result in a demand distribution for travel that roughly fits a power law profile. The demand for near travel (x > 0) is exponentially greater than further travel (y > x).<p>But don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;re failing to account for cultural dependencies that arise as a result of travel possibilities? Of different types of travel altogether?<p>For example, a 45 min subway commute is average in NYC [1]; as a result, going 30 min on the subway to meet someone who lives an hour away is not a big deal whatsoever. Since Metrocard costs don&#x27;t vary by distance or time, and you have 8 million people used to lengthly amounts of subway travel, inter-city friends and relationships are more varied and spread out over space. [2]<p>If we assume that the Hyperloop is _not_ a railroad, or an airplane, and will have different types of time/distance payoffs, then we would have to assume a different form of demand curve altogether. For example: Japan&#x27;s high speed trains -- and most importantly, their extreme reliability (like, to-the-minute) -- make long-distance commute a completely viable mode of transit. When high-speed trains are so reliable, you can have 9 minute transfer overlaps between two different trains going hundreds of kilometers, expanding range due to the UX, so to speak, of travel. It&#x27;s qualitatively different than just a faster Amtrak or a slower plane.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/Embargoed%20Hardest%20Working%20Cities%20Study.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/Embargoed%...</a>

Napoleon viewed himself as a better kind of dictator than the other European monarchs: one who rose to power through his own merit and who selected men for tasks based on their abilities, not their bloodlines. This narrative was decidedly less popular outside of France -- which had essentially executed all of its nobility in the preceding decades, so there was nobody left to disagree. But it really was a war of ideals over who should rule: an arbitrary (and increasingly inbred) line of inherited nobility, or the best man for the job?<p>If Napoleon had won at Waterloo, Europe would have saved itself a century of war. But the USA would also not exist in its current form -- much of the reason for the rise of American dominance in the 20th century was because Europe was rebuilt after WWII by the American war machine cranking out large quantities of steel and industrial machinery.<p>And who knows how the 20th century would have turned out without the US as a global superpower. Maybe without war and famine in 19th century Europe, there&#x27;s never a migration and the central US remains as uninhabited as Siberia.

9607298,comment,9606572,9606572,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Dating belongs to a category of industries that also includes jobsearch/careers, education, fitness, and socializing.  The characteristics of these industries are:<p>1. They are broad, holistic consumer problems where a success metric might be clearly defined (find a spouse, get a job, earn a degree), but the steps to get there aren&#x27;t.<p>2. There is a social status component: people (rightly or wrongly) make status judgments about your life outcomes.<p>3. Success means you don&#x27;t need a product.<p>There&#x27;s a big mistake that many rookie founders make with these industries (and I&#x27;m speaking from bitter experience founding a career-guidance startup): You can solve people&#x27;s problems, but you can&#x27;t rob people of their problems.<p>I met my fiancee on OKCupid.  I <i>met</i> her on OKCupid.  But I did the hard work of living an interesting life and adjusting my expectations to reality on my own.  We did the hard work of earning each others&#x27; trust and respect, building a relationship, and overcoming our differences together.  We deleted our OKCupid accounts about a month after meeting.<p>Similarly, someone who gets a job through LinkedIn <i>gets the job themselves</i>, LinkedIn doesn&#x27;t get the job for them.  They have to do the hard work of building the skills and meeting the qualifications themselves.  They need to build their network themselves.  They impress the hiring manager and interviewers themselves.  LinkedIn is a tool for managing this, but it is not and cannot be the reason for their success.<p>A lot of founders look at hard problems like dating or unemployment thinking &quot;This sucks.  It shouldn&#x27;t suck.  I&#x27;m not going to rest until everyone has the perfect spouse, perfect job, perfect skills, etc.&quot;  They don&#x27;t realize that <i>this is not a problem they can fix</i>.  If they could fix it, it would rob their customers of their humanity, of a lot of what makes them real.  The <i>reason</i> we choose people as employees, as spouses, and as friends is because of things they do and challenges they overcome, not because of products they use.<p>Successful companies in these spaces realize this and focus on one individual sub-problem they can solve to make people&#x27;s lives easier.  Tinder won&#x27;t get you into a relationship, but it shows you people of your preferred sex.  Indeed also shows you options, but getting the job is your responsibility.  Google has done wonderful things for self-education by making the whole web available with a few keywords.  LinkedIn and Facebook started out as great rolodexes, but then (IMHO) have been steadily ruining their products by trying to creep into more and more of my life.",1432670757

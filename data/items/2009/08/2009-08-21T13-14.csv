If you take someone's money and put it in a vault, how can you provide interest on that money?  You can't.  You'd, in fact, have to levy fees to cover the costs of staffing, buildings, security, etc.  Yes, even an internet bank has to have physical infrastructure somewhere.<p>Heck, why am I going to spend $3 for a SafeBank iPhone app when I can access my online banking from many banks for free?<p>He rails against ATM fees.  How is he going to get rid of them for me?<p>I don't notice that any of the large banks require the use of Internet Explorer.  BofA, Wells Fargo, Citi all work with non-IE browsers.  I'm sure one can find a bank (out of the many thousands in this country) that has a site that doesn't work with Firefox, but it isn't an easy thing to find - which is why he hasn't specified any particular bank!  He doesn't know of any!<p>While ad blocking might be cool, it has nothing to do with my bank.  It would be like WalMart telling me that acupuncture was good - it has nothing to do with their business.<p>People might hate banks, but they hate people mining them for data potentially more.  ""We noticed that you spend a lot at pornoshop.com.  Did you know cheapporn.com usually has better prices?""<p>--<p><i>And he hasn't satisfied the most important question: how would this be better than a member-owned credit union?</i>  A corporation has to try for profits.  A member-owned credit union gives those profits back to its members as dividends.  Their rules are set up for the benefit of their owners - who are the people depositing money with them.<p>The problem is that people want a host of expensive things.  They want tellers.  They want ATMs everywhere - and that means cash physically everywhere or you refunding the ATM fees.  They want free checks.  They want online banking.<p>While one can argue that the banking industry got a little out of control, you can't just put money in a safe and expect to be able to offer people all that.  You need to lend it out and that incurs risk and even more overhead - you have to deal with all the payments, the legal stuff when something bad happens, foreclosures (because, yes, some people won't end up paying you back).  And if you want to be ""safe"" and only lend to the most credit-worthy people, your margins go down because they're the people who can get money anywhere at really good rates.<p>I mean, if you lend me money at 4.83% (the overnight <i>average</i> for a 15 year fixed mortgage at bankrate.com) and give your depositors 2% interest on their money, you have a 2.83% margin to operate on.  But then you want to refund people's ATM fees of, let's say, $10/mo.  On $5,000 (more than the average depositor has), that means you have an effective 3% rate on deposits.  If the depositor only has $1,000 deposited, you've given them an effective over 10% rate and you're now way into the red.  And that doesn't even take into consideration the around 30% reserve you want to hold earning nothing.  And you'd want to give them free checks and not charge overage fees and do all sorts of nice things.<p>And if you're a ""nice"" bank, you'll want to provide lower mortgage rates than the average, right?<p>--<p>The fact is that there are already ""nice"" banks.  They're called credit unions.  They're owned and controlled by their members (customers).  How will you do better than a credit union that's a not-for-profit institution?<p>By being more efficient?  That's the only way.  And he's vastly over-estimated the money that rolls in when you play it ""safe"" and ""nice"".  Banks make a lot of money.  They make that money through a combination of managed risk and fees.  If you get rid of both of those, you don't make money, you lose it.",1250863185

Was _why's stuff art? Does it matter if we consider it art?<p>Maybe pulling things down is ""comparable"" to stealing, but it's not the same.  And the extent to which external resources were part of his work is not irrelevant.  There's tons of gray area here that's being glossed over.<p>Zed (and other posters) seem to have a view of the issue that lacks nuance.  ""He abandon us, he must be a dick."" I'm not sure know why ""dick"" is the only name Zed et al have for _why.  Besides the fact that the word is grating and low, it is bad form and, frankly, a little immature to use insults like that, especially when you don't know the whole story.  The HN community both eulogized and demonized _why too quickly.  Maybe it makes sense that hackers only think in binary terms and pass such stark judgment.<p>Look, I'm disappointed that _why is gone.  There have been good points made on this forum about people who depended on the mailing lists, etc.  And we can speculate ad-nauseam the causes for his disappearance.  Personally, I thought his work was touching.  As I discussed earlier, I also view him as an artist, with motivations that I think are very different from those of a typical hacker or engineer. But because we don't know the whole story, any judgment is based on speculation.

777512,comment,777385,777481,0,0,mosburger,,,"You're absolutely correct.  I used to work in the Mobile industry in the U.S.  FWIW, here's the sordid history behind the craziness - it wasn't merely to rip the consumer off initially.  It might help to imagine that all of this is taking place about 15 years ago:<p>Traditionally, toll charges (a surcharge) can be assessed to the calling party in the U.S. based mostly on area code (a.k.a. the NPA, the first three digits of the phone number), which designates a geographic region of the country.  Thus, the caller knows how much toll he/she will be charged based on the phone number.  I live in Maine, which is in the northeastern part of the U.S., with a 207 area code.  If I call a number with a 310 area code (mobile, landline, it doesn't matter), I know that's in Los Angeles, and I can expect to be assessed toll charges based on the fact that it is so far away.<p>Let's say I'm a mobile subscriber living in Maine, thus my mobile number will start with Maine's area code (207).  Let's say my mom, who also lives in Maine, gives me a call.  I happen to be roaming in Los Angeles.<p>When mom calls my mobile number, that call is routed to my home switch (a.k.a. the HLR).  which then forwards the call using a technique called ""call delivery,"" to a temporary number (called a TLDN) that was assigned to me by the visiting switch (the VLR), when I arrived in L.A.  My home switch knows my temporary number because it was transmitted to it when I arrived in L.A., so it's no biggie for it to just forward the call.<p>Now - who should pay the toll on the ""leg"" of the call between Maine and L.A.?  My mom didn't know I was in California, so is it fair to hit her with toll charges because she had no idea she was calling all the way across the country.  Naturally, it makes more sense to hit the receiving end with the toll charges.<p>In addition to toll, we used to have a myriad of mobile network providers in the U.S., and they had varying roaming agreements which charged the home carrier different airtime rates based on the nature of the agreement between the carriers.  Again, when I was in L.A., it probably cost my home carrier in Maine a lot more because the L.A. carrier would charge the Maine carrier an arm and a leg to host my call.  Who is responsible for this increase in charges?  There was no technical mechanism to pass it on to my mom, and it probably wouldn't be fair to sock her with it anyway, so it was charged to me, the recipient.<p>Now, with the advent of national plans with thousands of minutes, and with carriers consolidated down to a few national networks, and very low network costs, a lot of this doesn't make sense anymore.  And some carriers (I saw that someone mentioned U.S. Cellular) are coming to their wits and abandoning this tradition.  But getting huge, stodgy networks to change their ways and drop a cash cow for the hell of it when they have a virtual monopoly won't happen overnight.<p>TL;DR - it's a holdover from the early days when roaming cost more, and it wasn't fair to hit the calling party with surprise charges.  It probably shouldn't be that way any more.",1250862785

So he's not going to do much better for the customer on that end.<p>Plus, I don't know why he's complaining about bank bonuses.

He's examining a fascinating quirk of the human mind--that our stated preferences and our actual preferences are not the same thing.  According to the article, decisions about what we will want in the future and decisions about what we want now are processed in different areas of the brain.  The bug is in our brain's software, not in the Netflix algorithm.<p>Lehrer's book ""How We Decide"" is a really interesting look at many of these types of bugs in our mind.

777452,comment,777286,777286,0,0,grellas,,,"My favorite (not on this list): <i>Similis simili gaudet</i> - ""like rejoices in like.""<p>Latin lends itself to pithy forms of expression because it is highly inflected (""turned in""), as opposed to analytical (or ""loosened"") languages like English. The subject is normally built into the verb form rather than being separately expressed (""amo"" = ""I love""; ""amamus"" = we love) and contingent forms of expression are expressed in a slightly altered form (subjunctive mood) of the same verb as well, all with economy of expression (""amemus"" = ""let us love,"" ""that we may love""). With nouns, prepositional phrases signifying special uses in a sentence are also built into the noun form itself (""filius"" = boy; ""filiorum"" = ""of the boys""). Combine this with with a high degree of freedom in word order (""amo te"" or ""te amo"" each means ""I love you,"" though with slightly different emphasis), and you have a strong medium for expressing powerful thoughts easily and creatively.<p>A couple of illustrations of how this plays out, using a common legal expression:<p>""Res ipsa loquitur"" - ""the thing speaks for itself"" (literally, ""thing itself speaks"")<p>""Res ipsa loquatur"" - ""may the thing speak for itself"" or ""let the thing speak for itself""<p>""Res ipsae loquunt"" (or ""Loquunt res ipsae"" - or ""Ipsae loquunt res"") - ""things speak for themselves""<p>It is a devil of a language to learn (e.g., every verb has about 120 different forms) but lots of fun once you get there.",1250860532

A lot of people love to code and coding becomes the purpose on itself. The knowledge they are gaining WILL prove to be invaluable to them and to others and the fact that they are doing something because they want, not because they must will drive them much farther than if it was a commercial project.

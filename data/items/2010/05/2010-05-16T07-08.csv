Having just spent a week at BSDCan and the attached FreeBSD developer summit, I'd say that the biggest reason is code quality.<p>Apple very definitely supported LLVM/Clang because they wanted to avoid GPLv3.  FreeBSD is very happy to have a superior compiler available, and the fact that it's BSD licensed is extra icing on the cake.  But if LLVM wasn't happening, I'm 100% certain that we would end up importing a newer (GPLv3) version of gcc.",1273996439

1351630,story,,,17,7,AgentConundrum,"Ask HN: What resources exist for a first-timer starting a ""start-up"" in Canada?",,"Good morning Hackers. First time caller; long time listener.<p>I lost my job a while back and during my involuntary downtime I came up with two website ideas that I would like to build. The first is a bit of a joke and I'd hope that I could get it to a point where it could support itself via advertising (e.g. AdSense). I'm planning to build this one out first in order to convince myself that I've properly learned web skills to an adequate degree before moving on to the second project.<p>The second project falls into the category of ""building a better mousetrap."" I was recently searching for something (tangible, for purchase) online, and found that the resources for this were rather inadequate compared to my expectations. I came up with a list of things I would prefer existed on other sites, and came up with something else which seems new and innovative (to me, at least, though nobody I've explained it to has told me it was a dumb idea).<p>This site would be selling listings (i.e. advertising for a thing, as in ""car listings,"" ""rental listings,"" ""job listings"" etc.) to interested parties.<p>What I'm interested in acquiring from this community is resources relating to such endeavours in Canada. It seems a lot of information I see online relating to startups or business in general is geared toward American audiences.<p>I should note that money is something of an object to me at the moment (unemployed, savings getting low, living with girlfriend who likely wouldn't want me to push us into debt), so I'm hoping to imitate patio11's original ""$60 budget.""<p>Key topics to get the discussion moving:<p>- Liability: Do I need to start an LLC/Corporation for this? I've heard you don't even need to register as a business (you can operate under your own name) until you reach $30k or more per annum, though I assume if you're selling to businesses it would be preferably to have a proper company name to use.<p>- Taxes: Do I need to collect GST? What are the mechanics of that? What about tax reporting (personal and business)?<p>- Collecting payment: What are the catches to accepting payment online in Canada? What is my liability when using a provider for this in terms of data security?<p>- What else am I just completely missing right now?<p>I realize I'm asking a lot of the community here, but I'm rather afraid of missing something dumb and getting into legal trouble. I'm slightly paranoid that way.<p>Thanks for any help you can provide.",1273996350

Mashable and LH are probably not your target audience. You want big blogs about web development, analytics, SEO, PPC and that kind of thing to write about you. Don't just go for the obvious big names, but go for the big names that your target market reads. Pop quiz: name the two most famous bloggers in A/B testing world.<p>I think that's your main mistake.<p>2. There is a difference between quick news posts vs analysis posts. Your pitch email (as per another thread) is just the wrong way to target blogs with very different strategies. Mashable likes to be the first with any big breaking news. RWW is the more thoughtful of the bunch in that they take their time to think about the big picture. TC is very interested in deals: raising funding, getting bought out, etc. Your email needs to target each blog properly.

In many ways I find the Android superior to the iPhone model.<p>App transclusion, in my mind, is a positive. The application stack on Android makes great sense. It creates a repeatable sequence of events that I find easy to navigate. My wife, who is very much non-technical agrees. She has a much easier time with Android than she did with iPhone(s).<p>While there are definitely issues with device fracturing it's an issue I'm hoping Google works to control more cleanly in the future. As it stands today you can safely target a small number of devices with more or less compatible specs and do quite well.<p>Android 2.2 continues to address a lot of these issues. The pace at which the platform has matured is very nice.<p>Overall, I think the user experience on Android is rapidly approaching (and in some cases surpasses) that of the iPhone.

""[...] their world is slipping away. It is.""<p>Freedom from porn? Steve pulls no punches--what does porn mean to us? Is it something evil, something that only subjugated people will perform in? Does it provide an legitimate outlet for a different sort of sexual fetish? Who uses whom? I don't know the answers, but I'm sure there are a multitude, many of them with a nugget of truth.<p>I don't feel as if we need to be protected from ourselves. This is a statement--assuming that it was, in fact, reported in good faith--written by a man in a position of power which asserts a sort of moral judgement about our culture.<p>Please, don't misunderstand: Mr. Jobs is entirely correct in his statement that, ""Microsoft had (has) every right to enforce whatever rules for their platform they want. If people don’t like it, they can write for another platform, which some did. Or they can buy another platform, which some did.""  Indeed, Apple appears (from my non-lawyerly perspective) to be exercising the same supposed right without serious challenge in a court of law.<p>I, myself, write on a MacBook.

Google's development of ChromeOS is gutsy. Android ain't.<p>The Android team did most of what they could to repeat all the mistakes of NewtonOS (app transclusion), the Sidekick (mandatory incomplete instant OTA-only sync), and classic Windows Mobile (total fealty to fractious manufacturers and carriers) — and then they added some of their own absurd retardation on top of that (like anything to do with the SD card, Dalvik, OpenBinder, etc.).",1273994007

It's a public web site and the main focus of it is to (key word here) SHARE information with your social network.  Why would you even consider putting something that you feel is private on this site in the first place?  I've only been using the site for a few months now when I caved after seeing all my friends scheduling things on it but that's really all it is.  A place to talk to all my friends (technical and non-technical) at once.  If you have some private pictures to share with them or something to tell them privately just send it in an email or tell it to them next time you see each other.",1273993859

And I think the only difference between evolution (as you've described it) and validation is that seeing how people use what you build, and getting qualitative data on those users is emphasised, rather than something that just happens over time.<p>At a minor level, that could be making sure that the next feature you implement is the one that will make your software much more usable from their point of view, rather than the shiniest or most technically interesting to implement.  (e.g. it doesn't matter if your mousetrap automatically telling your computer when it's caught something, if their local mice just aren't interested in $bait_that_works_best_in_bobs_house )<p>On the larger scale, if your customers are using your product to solve a problem you didn't expect, you can't optimise your product so it sells even better.  If the largest user of your mousetrap is the gremlin-catcher's guild, then perhaps you need to look at building more gremlin-specific features, and changing your marketing a little.<p>And, of course, the simplest metric for validation is that if they ain't buying it then it ain't doing what they want enough for them to pay for it.<p>Disclaimer: I have never run a startup, let alone used these principles.  They just seem to make sense to me.",1273993814

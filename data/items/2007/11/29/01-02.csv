That hour of walking you suggest is easily replaced by simply reducing caloric intake slightly. ...""</i><p>One thing I have found is exercise done before eating reduces appetite. Slight reductions in food is difficult if there is an abundance of high fat/high calorie food.  Especially if it tastes good.  One insight into the relationship between food, exercise and culture is the Japanese in places like Okinawa [0] & Sakaemura [1] who have:<p>- low calorie, low fat diet<p>- high energy output (mostly via farming & activities such as karate)<p>- social networking<p>contributing 4-5 years on average longer lifespans it is thought through leanness. [2] They key thing appears to the combination of diet, exercise and societal connection. Exercise is one of the keys to leanness but not the only one. <p>One thing you can bet on. If you don't exercise, eat the wrong foods and too much of it you will loose fitness.<p>[0]  <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/sydney/stories/s1329191.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/sydney/stories/s1329191.htm</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/09/1089000356464.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/09/1089000356464.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200704/000020070407A0077297.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200704/000020070407A00...</a>",1196300568

84482,comment,84268,84466,0,0,downer,,,"> Horse crud.<p>> Exercise is the best way to reduce weight for all but the most unfit.<p>Not so.  That hour of walking you suggest is easily replaced by simply reducing caloric intake slightly.  In fact, you have to watch intake anyway, because when you exercise, your body automatically increases your appetite to compensate for the additional energy expenditure.<p><a href=""http://nymag.com/news/sports/38001/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/news/sports/38001/</a><p><i>""He will have to climb twenty flights of stairs to rid himself of the energy contained in one slice of bread!"" Newburgh observed. So why not skip the stairs, skip the bread, and call it a day?</i><p>The reasons to exercise include all sorts of health and fitness benefits, but losing weight is pretty far down the list.  Even top athletes always have to be careful with diet and often weigh their food with gram scales.\n",1196298226

3903410,comment,3902697,3903111,3,0,kds,,,"10% increase in 3 years translates to around. 3.3% yearly growth rate. So in your example the 3.3% increase would be that 10M$ => so 1% of your annual business revenue is 10/3.3 or just above 3M$.<p>But that means you already have a <i>really significant</i> business that makes ~300 M$ per year. And you manage to increase it just by peanuts (relatively speaking).<p>And there is inflation in economy, and the alternative costs  of not investing such a huge sum or part of in Apple stocks (for example) during those years.<p>My point explained better:<p>The startup success of getting from zero to millions just because of clever ML/data-science/statistics is something to be respected and admired.

3903401,comment,3902170,3902170,7,0,zzzeek,,,"Big problems with older projects that want to move to GitHub.<p>GitHub's bug reporting API has no means of importing bugs from other systems, without losing all date and user information.   Projects that have moved their issue systems over have the full expanse of issues all opened/resolved on the same date and by the same person, and are basically unreadable (sorry, comments with the original info in them don't count).  Django in this case is keeping trac for issue reporting.<p>I've emailed github about this, and I got kind of a sleepy ""no, we don't really do that, shrugs"".   I had an insight at that moment, that Github probably does this because they don't <i>want</i> big, ugly old projects moving their 8000 big ugly tickets into their shiny system (Edit: but they've just responded that they want to do this!  so, great).   My inspiration to move SQLAlchemy to github went to zero in an instant.   Fuck that.   Old projects and old history about projects matter.  A lot.<p>Keeping issue reporting on Trac - AFAICT, Django hasn't solved the issue of coordinate changeset links from trac back to an external service like github.    They still seem to have their SVN repo linked in trac.    Though this could be solved, with a fair degree of tedium, by first converting all the SVN links in their bug reports to be the equivalent changeset id in git, then hosting a mirror of the git repo.   I originally did this when we moved from SVN to mercurial.",1335632046

Poring over many millions of rows of transaction data and thousands of payment codes (which, of course, were unique across sales geographies), we determined the ten regions at highest risk of reimbursement collapse. R was used, maps were created, beers all around.<p>But almost none of it was used for the executive presentation. In fact, the only part that was included was that we had ten regions that needed fixing, and our suggestions on how to fix it. You see, the CEO was dyslexic, the chairman of the board was colorblind, and the COO was a white-boarding kind of gal, so given this audience the nuts and bolts of our advanced statistical analysis were simply irrelevant.<p>This is hardly surprising. If we are having so much trouble hiring people who are fluent in Big Data, how can we expect business leaders to be even conversant? With only slight exaggeration, the way you do your analysis and the visualizations that you create are not important.<p>Companies are demanding Big Data scientists because they suddenly have lots of data and see the term Data Scientist in the news.

3903380,comment,3900711,3903269,8,0,keypusher,,,"Because the electronic wave of the 90's/00's was completely missed by most Americans, and it has just taken that long to break into the cultural mainstream here.  Radio friendly DJ's who promoted their brands to the masses such as Oakenfold and Tiesto were a big factor, but it is also generational.  For instance, my friends and I were pretty into the late 90's electronic scene in the NE US.  We loved trance, progressive, house, jungle, dnb, breakbeat, and adored the ambient/experimental stuff as well.  At that point though it felt like almost everything great was coming out of Europe and we were regarded as weirdos at school for being into this music.<p>However, some of us had younger siblings, and cousins.  And they grew up looking up to someone they though was cool and loved this music.  So they thought it must be cool too, and showed their friends.  At the same time, many of the people I grew up with were graduating college and started to work, and putting their favorite electronic music in advertising and websites and music soundtracks etc.  Why didn't it catch on earlier, as it had in Europe?  I think much of it had to with American attitudes and policy toward drugs and the control of the record companies on music promotion.  The only place you might hear electronic back then was late night college radio or MTV late Saturday night.  There was a sense that this was very much dirty underground druggy music, and event promotion was still very much by flyers and word of mouth.  That kind of thing will never catch on in the US mainstream, where there needs to be a sexy, familiar face on the posters and TV advertisements.",1335631474

I think vendors get this on some level, that's why they let us use these properties, but they need to do a better job as a collective: the working groups that draft the standards. If they standardize faster, there won't be any change in your ability to use brand new technology at the current rate.<p>For example: webkit devs think of a new property. They build it, they like it, they make it publicly available. Chrome guys enable using this in the dev and beta channel. In a couple weeks they have feedback on performance and stuff. Whatwg convenes, they finalize the details, webkit guys make a few adjustments (and it's fine because there's only 2 webpages on the entire internet that's been using it for a month tops) and then soon it hits the stable channel. This is what we need. Fast updating browsers could rape the benefits of such a system very nicely, fast updating is what we need to let the web evolve fast enough anyway. Slow updating browsers can go die in a fire, they are just as slow with supporting everything else.<p>Also, not to nitpick, but opera on the mobile front isn't unimportant. It's the only alternative to webkit, it's nearly ubiquitous and not a bad experience on mobile.",1335631278

This alone will save you a ton of grief (parking, tickets, rules about which side of the street you can park on and when and so on) and money (insurance in the city I believe is higher) and you simply don't need it;<p>- Get rid of your stuff. You need a suitcase of clothes, a computer and, well, that's about it. The more of the rest you can get rid of the better;<p>- There are decent parks of Brooklyn and Queens you can find a room for $1000/month or less.

However, many of us know how ""temporary"" code can mold into permanent code.<p>> One of the use-cases that led Opera to support webkit prefixes were sites that styled a button using a webkit gradient. Without the webkit gradient, the user received white text on a white background. So in this case, only webkit browser users saw a button, other browsers saw nothing.<p>So we're back to UA sniffing circa 1999. Opera took a similar action\nby fudging the browser's UA version to ""9.80"".<p>> Opera, Firefox, and Microsoft were all receiving bug reports of this nature, in quantity.

It's a brick wall in terms of evangelism.<p>This is reminding me of the ordered enumeration of keys in JavaScript debate. The specification was very clear that order was not to be expected, yet developers complained anyways (including John Resig, oddly enough.)

3903298,comment,3902744,3902978,3,0,Isofarro,,,"Not using vendor prefixes isn't a better idea. The reason for vendor prefixes is to allow developers to experiment with these features and feedback bugs, issues, improvements and future feature suggestions. It's a testing ground, and the web is a great environment to collect information about that testing. So not supporting vendors efforts doesn't encourage them to innovate. Perhaps these vendor prefixes should be limited to alpha/beta versions of browsers instead?<p>A better idea is for developers not to rely solely on vendor prefixes. Use them, but don't rely on them.<p>One of the use-cases that led Opera to support webkit prefixes were sites that styled a button using a webkit gradient. Without the webkit gradient, the user received white text on a white background. So in this case, only webkit browser users saw a button, other browsers saw nothing.<p>Opera, Firefox, and Microsoft were all receiving bug reports of this nature, in quantity. So it's not really practical to reply to users with a ""site developer's fault"" - it's a losing proposition, because - much like tomjen3's attitude in this thread - the site developer doesn't care. It's a brick wall in terms of evangelism.<p>Opera have taken 13 webkit prefixes and aliased them as opera prefixed - when the corresponding opera prefix isn't present. That is a practical user-centric solution that works until vendor-prefixes are crushed under the weight of technical debt.<p>(London Web Standards hosted State of the Browser today - <a href=""http://browser.londonwebstandards.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://browser.londonwebstandards.org/</a> , including a panel session with representatives from Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Chrome panelists - no Safari representative, Apple declined the invitation.

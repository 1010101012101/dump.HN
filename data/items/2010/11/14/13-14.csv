Wouldn't looking at Apple's structure when they were a startup be more useful?<p>Aside from that, there are a lot of founders who have some level of design skills -- they just also happen to do other things, since that's how startups work.

Facebook is full of stupid crap, too.  Facebook made the better choice to focus on innovating community features, which was its strength, where MySpace failed to innovate along its own strengths.  Maybe was poorly designed or poorly managed, or maybe they simply panicked and tried to be facebook but clearly not as effectively.  I don't know.

1339523,comment,1339150,1339150,0,0,sraybell,,,"Very interesting approach.  I still reel a bit from the thought of it.  I presume this is your blog, so I'll try to be as courtesy as possible in my criticism.  :-)<p>This invites all the same problems.  There are management styles in play at some groups that seem to think that number of anything is a good measure.  It's quantity over quality.  If your next release has a ""big feature"", but a concise implementation, they may wonder why you only generated 20 code files instead of 200.  And you're right back to square one again.<p>This may only apply to certain solutions, too.  You mentioned python.  I'm curious to see if the same could be applied to C#, or Java.  Further, I've found that in some projects, we have Enums.cs, for instance, that contain all our enumeration types in that given Namespace or Pacakge (C# and Java respectively).  Maybe they should get their own code file?  Maybe not?<p>I think before you implement a system like this, you have to implement a good design structure.  Otherwise, you have no solid adherence.  You could easily bloat the count, or undercut it, as necessary.<p>Ultimately, we need a way to measure performance objectively, without meaningless numbers.  I don't have a good solution, and I really don't know if I like yours or not.  Hrm.<p>Thanks for the post, though!  Will give me something to chew on while I run my scripts...  :-)",1273618710

1339518,comment,1339153,1339393,0,0,danudey,,,"Among other reasons, I'd guess this is Apple's attempt at modernization. The GCC/libc/libstdc++ codebase has been around for ages, and has accumulated cruft. Starting from scratch isn't always a solution, but in cases like this I think it can be.<p>Modernizing the compiler (via clang/LLVM) is a great step forward, but modernizing the C++ libraries to take advantage of the new compiler infrastructure is a sensible step 2. If they can in fact speed up compilation speed and memory requirements (both at compile-time and run-time), as well as providing link-time and run-time optimization, it could be a big win, especially for large C++ projects (such as Mozilla, KDE, Qt, etc.).",1273618590

1339514,comment,1338459,1338973,0,0,alsomike,,,"That's only because you're created a straw-man definition of design. Don't buy the hype: design is about influencing the subjective state of the audience. Sure, beauty is one kind of experience, and maybe it gets a lot of attention, but it's certainly not the only thing designers care about.<p>I think the main skill that designers bring to the table is empathy. Unlike traditional artists, who can safely ignore what other people think, designers have to be interested in how something feels to their audience. This is important if you're building things for people who aren't like you and don't think like you, and you want to get their attention, get them to think what they're buying is useful and usable and yes, maybe beautiful if that matters, and the people who made it are trustworthy and reliable.<p>Design is about communication--it's a kind of language. Who could argue that words don't matter, only function matters?",1273618496

This is another 'close, but not quite' example.<p>The current implementation is that I have a hardware instance (like a CPU) that I want to monitor. To do that, I create a new monitor object, and tell it to monitor the hardware instance, and the monitor will mix itself in from there. It's not good if extra methods show up in the global namespace just for command parsing within a single module of the app. The monitor is just a part of this application, and a part that will not be used often by most users.<p>Everything I see feels like it's inches from what I really need.

1339483,comment,1339113,1339113,0,0,grayrest,,,"1) I started with HTML in '96 and, TI calculator programming aside, it wasn't until 2000 (college) that I got into programming. Mostly because I asked around and nobody knew where to tell me to start (Java -> Python -> Javascript). If I were starting today and on a *nix environment, I'd start with javascript. Doing simple socket programming with node.js is dead simple and the browser provides an obvious gui progression path. I've also heard of a lot of people starting with Python and very recently with Obj-C/iphone development.<p>2) Started with a teach-yourself HTML 3.2 book. For learning JS today, I think eloquentjavascript.net is good if a bit dry and I like Manning's jQuery in Action if going the jQuery route.<p>3) I started out with the intent of making a WYSIWYG web editor that didn't suck...and I'm still planning on doing it at ""some point"".<p>4) No guidance for me, unfortunately. Aside from having a professor in my first Java class say ""well don't worry about that, you don't need to understand it for a while"", which annoyed me enough that I went and learned Java myself through Thinking in Java. Otherwise I'm entirely self taught.<p>5) Guidance on what to look at/what to understand would have been helpful.

For example, it's no secret on the right that entitlement spending has the US government on a course towards bankruptcy. So the right wing tends to think the left wing is stupid when they support even more generous benefits.<p>But I read an interview with Paul Krugman the other day where he acknowledged the fact that our entitlements are unsustainable. Of course, having a Nobel prize in economics, he would not be so blind as to miss our looming national bankruptcy. But he figures if the public finances get bad enough, then politicians will be forced to raise taxes and/or nationalize health care, i.e. follow the leftist plan. The theory is that if politicians play chicken with global debt markets then eventually they will be forced to swerve.<p>Krugman has more faith in politicians than I do.

It would look something like this:<p>""The number of thalidomide birth defects estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000 according to Wikipedia. Given the rate of cancer death in this country, a net one year delay applied across all effective therapies compounded across many years almost certainly outweighs your one example. Excessively liberal medicine policy may kill and maim, but so does excessively conservative policy; it's not a pure win by any means. Are you so sure that our policy is really the best policy?""<p>This isn't a question you can actually determine the best answer to with a series of anecdotes. You have to actually do a statistical analysis. I have not done this statistical analysis, so all I can say is something like ""I'd bet money we're being too conservative"", or ""My libertarian leanings lead me to say we should have a more liberal acceptance policy on the grounds of personal freedom"", but just screaming about deformed babies with no other analysis like this is an emotional tactic that should be replaced with something better. Too many people's lives are on the line for this debate to be shut down with ""won't someone please think of the babies?""",1273615509

I appreciate seeing it here immediately, just because it's nice to be timely without having to put a chess website on my RSS reader.  As I mentioned, I think a club player with an interest in the chess world would find it engaging, even if they ""couldn't tell the difference"" between it and another grandmaster game.<p>I don't think your logic corresponds to the actual community preference when it comes to putting things on the front page.  There are a <i>huge</i> amount of general interest articles devoted to things that everyone will see elsewhere.  It's because people like having one-stop shopping for recent news and because people value the HN comment threads on news items.  (I did go and spend a few minutes examining the portion of the game that they're discussing above, and I'm the better for it, I suppose.)<p>Look, I'm with you if think that we should only have really fascinating content that people are unlikely to find on their own, like some awesome technical Metafilter.  I would love a site like that.  Go make one.  On the HN front page is an article about today's Senate vote on the Sanders amendment; the same ""1000 true fans"" article we've all seen ten times for two years; an obituary for Frank Frazetta from the NYT; assorted press releases from small companies; a repost from Reddit about Facebook FUD.  (To be fair, there are some good posts, too.)  So that's not what we have.  We have general interest articles about all kinds of vaguely newsworthy things with OK commentary.  Hell, we frequently have the very same articles posted month after month.  On that scale, I think this weighs in above average.",1273615272

1339360,comment,1339118,1339319,0,0,philwelch,,,"For the longest time there was a theory called ""starve the beast"". The idea is that Republicans interested in reducing the scope of the federal government could cut taxes and actually increase spending, forcing a deficit crisis and a sudden paring-back of the government (similar to the now famous Greek ""austerity measures"") and creating a permanent distrust of big government.<p>I bring this up because it seems like a similar tactic could be applied to the FED. The FED doesn't hyperinflate because there's no oversight or control by Congress--if there was oversight, Congress would do all they could to get the FED to hyperinflate just to increase spending. Maybe goldbugs want to introduce permanent oversight and control over the FED just to cause that hyperinflation, just so they could turn around and say ""Look! Central banks are untrustworthy!"".<p>There are <i>lots</i> of similar examples on the left, whether deliberate or accidental--regulating certain industries within inches of their lives (healthcare) and then pointing to it as a market failure.",1273615248

My mother, a nurse for 40 years and the director of protocols for a string of hospitals in southwest Missouri, took him to the hospital for care.   They were very hesitant to give him the anti-venom, but after about 20 hours and a move to the ICU, they gave him the ONLY dose they had at the hospital.   He's a big burly bastard, and they decided he needed another dose.   They had to put him in an ambulance and take him an hour to the next hospital to get another dose.<p>My mother, after seeing everything first hand, launched into a review of their snake-bite procedures.   She came to find out after speaking with the head pharmacist, that the anti-venom our friend needed was $64,000 - and they have a short shelf life!  This was the reasoning for only having one dose at the hospital they went to.<p>Our friend is fine, and has a good story to tell.   My mother called a 'meeting of the minds' for the hospitals she oversees to try to find a solution.<p>All that to say, yes, there are indeed problems with anti-venom!",1273615209

3388558,comment,3385596,3386851,3,0,superasn,,,"In real world this isn't the case. First of all, when you're working on projects, you see that there are some things which you're doing over and over (like CRUD). Now at least in my opinion it is okay to create your first site by using mysql_real_escape_string like functions as long as by the end of the day it gets the job done. Because my priority as a small website owner is always getting new signups. And as far as I'm concerned, my lead does not care how I'm inserting his email into the database. But had I spend my time learning the proper MVC design, I maybe would have lost three precious months of leads which does indeed make a difference to my bank account.<p>Second of all nowadays you're never working alone (even when in fact you're working alone). What I mean is every programmer nowadays uses Google and StackOverflow to do a lot of his work. So when you're doing something wtf like using the mysql_real_escape_string, you maybe once in a while try to check how other programmers are doing it because maybe for you it takes too long or you're just stuck. And then you learn a thing or two about how to do is more easily. Still, it doesn't mean you have to become a great programmer of the language first, instead you just need to hone the things which you need the most for your business.",1324716033

The part that struck me as odd, and the part that matters for this conversation, was where he claimed nothing happened.<p><a href=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kc0f6ZQZebY/TvWDhFSHYEI/AAAAAAAADag/G23qcWvjkag/s628/edmund.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kc0f6ZQZebY/TvWDhFSHYEI/A...</a><p>Note that I sent him the tweet at exactly midnight my time.

He mentioned a few man-days worth of debugging that would have been prevented, but it sounds like he spent more time than that in checking. As he noted at the beginning, other factors (like features) are more important than quality (productivity is an argument for dynamically typed languages). Of course, quality is also its own reward.<p>BTW: dated today, but I'm sure I've read it before. Maybe a write up of the earlier episodes (e.g. /Analyze in 360 SDK).",1324713621

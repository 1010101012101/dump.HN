This would take the question of stock price out of the question.<p>I think bringing price into the equation is arguing details unrelated to the point of the question. I would assume most of us here at HN are familiar with the matter and have an approximation of how much FB is worth.<p>I personally have low expectations for the future of Facebook. As a graduating senior in college right now, I joined Facebook near it's inception during my senior year of high school when my peers first got .edu accounts and it was still private. Almost everyone I knew made the switch over from MySpace over a year or so.<p>If you can recall what Facebook was like back in the day: it was an exclusive club for college students. No high schoolers and no ""adults."" I really think this targeted niche was really one of the most appealing factors when I joined. I also really enjoyed the static structure and cleanliness of each page. It was nothing like the myspace mess of fugly personalized layouts everywhere. It was just a nice clean, niche, social environment.<p>But they've changed a lot since then, and only gotten more unappealing. I remember the days my friends and I dreaded the ""public opening"" of facebook, when your little brother in middle school and your parents and grandparents started joining facebook. Among all the other features they've now added to their bloat, facebook is just becoming the social Microsoft. All the old fogies are trying to jump on the bandwagon and market their facebook sites, while all the original members like me are leaving.<p>My facebook page as of the moment just shows my twitter stream and I check it once or twice a month to see what new comments and event invites I've gotten. That's it. I honestly don't really care what the majority of my 600 ""friends"" are doing; I got code to write.",1280598547

1564016,comment,1563671,1563671,0,0,benreyes,,,"Personally I think the whole eHarmony model is dead (or dying).<p>I'm interested in people's social interactions and how that is changing with new people growing up with no digital prejudices against technology.<p>I believe social networking replaces traditional online dating. Especially the younger you get the more true this is. The eHarmony model tends to prosper over inflation of the details you put down.<p>Okay so the trend that I see happening in younger people is that traditionally Myspace actually took this space for finding new friends online with people under 18 (non-tech). Facebook has a social contract that you typically have to meet the person or heavily been in a person's social circle before becoming friends on facebook.<p>The site currently ruling making new friends online is Dailybooth and YouTube which is immerensly popular with under 21s. Not only do participants make ""online friends"" they usually translate into offline friends. I have personally observed a high percentage rate of meetups and ""gatherings"" with both these communities.<p>So what makes Dailybooth popular with making new friends.\n1) Use of actual photos of the person on a dailyish basis: This allows for people to follow people that they would be generally interested in hanging out with. The use of images from a webcam also means that you can verify the person, that they are real, and again images are a very powerful tool in considering if you'll like the person or not.<p>2) The details on dailybooth has the standard social networking info and also the location. Dailybooth users when they gather or meet up with one another they tend to take a booth/photo of the meetup each tagging the other people. This drives other people to meetup in groups.<p>------------<p>In consideration of an algorithm I've been meaning to pitch Dailybooth on an idea to populate a user's photo stream with people that you can calculate based on the network graph of who the user has followed/followed back. And based on location, to try and increase the percentage of people making offline friends using the service. Which decreases churn rate and brand value.<p>So yeah, I'm heavily researching this area right now so if you interested in discussing it further my details are on <a href=""http://benreyes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benreyes.com</a><p>I could talk about this topic for days.",1280597926

Of couse there are SOME desperate users, but they are far from the majority.<p>I tried out Match 4 years ago because I was out of college and just moved to a new city, both factors which make it much harder to meet men I'm compatible with. I thought that by looking at profiles online, I could efficiently choose people to date who had the exact qualities I was looking for. My boyfriend (who I met on Match) used the site for the exact same reasons. I know at least a dozen other couples who are also normal, social people who met the same way. They certainly weren't desperate, nor were most of the people they went on dates with. Because so many non-desperate couples have met through online dating sites, the number of non-desperate users must be a pretty large pool.",1280597777

Even so, we will certainly end up with more than a few companies that will sell in that range. That is a successful outcome for us too if we can own 15-20% of the business and have less than $5mm invested, which is the case for many of our companies.</i><p>At the high end, $5mm invested at 20% would mean a post-money valuation of $25 million. That's 1-2X. Or am I misunderstanding this?<p>Though, the multiplier doubles as the amount invested at 20% halves. Since most of their investments seem to be further away from $5 million, that could be what I'm overlooking.",1280596402

Then again, E&D was largely dysfunctional because there's been an odd combination of failing to leverage MS technology when it would make sense while trying to shoehorn MS techs into places where they just didn't work. See buying Danger and then pretty much scrapping their technology to build the Kin as a prime example. It pretty well illustrates the institutional schizophrenia the company shows to the world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.electronista.com/articles/10/05/25/microsoft.overhauls.devices.group.to.face.iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.electronista.com/articles/10/05/25/microsoft.over...</a>",1280596366

Considering the 'average' person assumes P90X and the Ab Circle are proper exercise and that dietary fat makes your body fat, that doesn't seem too outlandish a claim.<p>As you didn't learn anything new, I trust you are well-read in fitness and nutrition, but since being a professional computer user doesn't explicitly require physical fitness, this might actually be a pretty useful resource for some of the readers here. And even if it weren't, said readers are likely to have mothers, fathers, significant others or children who could benefit from it. It specifically declares itself an ""owner's manual for the human body"", not some sort of secret hard-living comrade method for muscle growth or whatever; since you are already versed, your response would be like a Mathematics Professor writing an amazon review for ""Fundamentals of Algebra"" and saying ""this stuff is all rehashed, there's nothing here I haven't seen before"". Or you know, for a programmer to slam a ""Computers for Dummies"" book as being too basic.<p>Anyway, I respect your opinion and appreciate you giving it a shot, but I feel like you either were looking for the wrong thing or just didn't look too hard. Possibly since it's free, you got what you paid for it.<p>By the way I'm the author. I'm not trying to make a secret of that or anything, I just didn't initially feel it was relevant to the discussion.",1280596210

It was a risky vision, involving a subscription and the innovative ability to share songs you haven't bought legally, wirelessly with the person standing next to you.<p>I really think the failure was purely marketing, judging by the accounts of people who used the service, that and people's assumption that anything from Microsoft cannot be innovative or interesting - it's a self-fulfilling prophecy in a lot of ways.

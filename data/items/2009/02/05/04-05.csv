467110,comment,466485,466857,0,0,netcan,,,">> That advantage is increased diversity within a species.<p>Actually evolution doesn't really work like that. Traits will rarely evolve to the benefit of a species. Evolution operates much more strongly at the individual level & even more strongly at the gene level.<p>It's discussed some place in the video belos but I don't remember which part (of 6). Worth watching if you're interested anyway. Otherwise, the evolutionary reason given there for aging is an evolutionary bias for 'fixing' diseases that affect the young. A disease, deadly at 5 years old is more of a problem for lifetime reproductions then something deadly at 20 which is more of a problem then something at 30 etc. I'm not sure if this explains aging in it's entirety, but it seems like a logical part.<p>None of your ancestors died at infancy. Very few are likely to have died younger then 15. You can probably trace some that died younger then 25. It would be unusual not to have some within memory that died younger then 50.<p>Since ancestral humans probably rarely lived (reproduced or contributed to the reproduction of their offspring) past 40-50, it's not surprising that there are many issues unique to this life stage that have had very little evolutionary tweaking done.<p>What I would like to ask/say (Richard, if you're reading, speak up) is that this might explain why old age illnesses are more severe. It doesn't do much to explain the discrepancies in young/old illnesses.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnCJqDa1us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnCJqDa1us</a>",1233809386

467108,comment,466704,466983,0,0,shimon,,,"The existence of those factors is not hard to communicate.  Your manager will probably understand and sympathize, but without a measurable cost or benefit, how is she going to argue for them in a committee with other managers?  Sure, we get that your private offices are going to make your team more productive, but is that $100k more productive or $1M more productive?  If you can even begin to answer that question without the rest of the crowd falling asleep, you're amazing.  There is always pressure to make simple, easily justifiable decisions, rather than nuanced, complex ones; unless you can find simple terms to argue in, you just brought a paintbrush to a gun fight.",1233809226

467096,comment,466845,466845,0,0,jimrandomh,,,"Textbook regex algorithms assume that you're trying to determine whether a string matches an expression using a standard set of operators. Perl regular expressions have to match text to subexpressions, rather than just return a yes/no answer, and have a greatly expanded set of operators, some of which are completely incompatible with the usual NFA and DFA algorithms. It even lets you drop arbitrary perl code into the middle of a regex. You can easily write a perl regex that is NP-complete to match. You can't do that with the simplified regex language that textbooks talk about.",1233808332

467081,comment,466110,466600,0,0,bwd,,,"There's a much simpler explanation: the collapse of subprime mortgages forced people to confront the fact that there is way too much leverage in the economy.  Too many people and companies owe money that they won't be able to pay back.  The level of production of goods and services was based on the level of consumer and business spending, which everyone now realizes was being fueled by excessive debt.  The level of production must now fall to a level that is consistent with businesses and consumers using much less debt going forward, and it will certainly overshoot on the downside because of panic and lack of information.<p>The question that I see being repeated in the media these days is ""what are the banks doing with the bailout money, why aren't they lending it?""  Perhaps the answer is that there is currently nobody out there who is a good enough credit risk to lend money to.  Another possible answer is that the banks now realize that they've lost the ability to quantify credit risk correctly and they are going to need to relearn that skill.",1233807240

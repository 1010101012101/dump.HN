2 - Firm agreed not to bill further hours due to issues.
3 - oDesks notification system advised four separate transactions would be billed over a 1 month period.  These were legitimate transactions for a different provider.<p>4 - oDesk charged my Credit Card three times the amount they said they were going to!<p>5 - oDesk claims that I did not dispute the charges; hence I was liable.<p>6 - See point 3 - I had no dispute with the legitimate transactions<p>7 - THIS is the best part - Told oDesk I was going to close my account and deal with the legitimate developer personally<p>8 - oDesk informs me that if I proceed as described in point 7, I was liable for:
15% X 12 months billing for that developer ($5,500)  !!!<p>9 - Customer support -- NON existent.  It appears that oDesks sole Modus Operandi is to collect their 10% at any and all cost.  End of story.<p>BE WARE -- These guys are crooks.",1285131404

I may be wrong, of course.<p>I think that “Me” or “My” should be used when a title of a section (a page or a field) does not contain an action (a verb). It should also be used when a button, link, or title of a page contains a phrase that implies that the user is ordering the system to perform an action. For example:<p>Field Title: My Company Name:
Page Title: My Main Menu
Button: [ Change My Password ]
Link: Reset My Account<p>In contrast, I think that “Your” or “you” should be used when the system is telling or asking something from the user. For example:<p>Field Title: What is your password?
Message: You can always change your settings…
Link: Click here to contact your agent
Message: Your are signed in as:<p>Whenever I have the option of using one or the other, I go for “My”. For example, if I have the option of using both “Post My Project” and “Post Your Project”, I use “Post My Project”. Why? Because on “Post Your Project” the system is asking the user to do something, while in “Post My Project” the user is ordering the system to perform an action.

I have still have immense respect for persons who act out their beliefs at personal cost, but now I advise everyone in general to test their beliefs on all subjects against reality.

4372125,comment,4372020,4372020,27,0,ajankovic,,,"I was actually very touched by the quote left in the comments and it's worth mentioning it here:<p><i>A pro views her work as craft not art. Not because she believes art is devoid of mystical dimension. On the contrary. She understands that all creative endeavor is holy, but she doesnt dwell on it. She knows if she thinks about that too much it will paralyze her. So she concentrates on technique. The professional masters how, and leaves what and why to the gods. Like Somerset Maugham she doesnt wait for inspiration she acts in anticipation of its apparition. The professional is acutely aware of the intangibles that go into inspiration. Out of respect for them she lets them work. She grants them their sphere while she concentrates on hers.<p>The sign of the amateur is the overglorification of, and preoccupation with, the mystery.<p>The professional shuts up. She doesnt talk about it. She does her work.</i>",1344757648

Its literal meaning, one which I suspect goes back to the origin of the Martian race as thinking, speaking creaturesand which throws light on their whole 'map'is quite easy. 'Grok' means 'to drink.' ""<p>""Huh?"" said Jubal. ""But Mike never says 'grok' when he's just talking about drinking. He""<p>""Just a moment."" Mahmoud spoke to Mike in Martian.<p>Mike looked faintly surprised and said, "" 'Grok' is drink,"" and dropped the matter.<p>""But Mike would also have agreed,"" Mahmoud went on, ""if I had named a hundred other English words, words which represent what we think of as different concepts, even pairs of antithetical concepts. And 'grok' means all of these, depending on how you use it. It means 'fear,' it means 'love,' it means 'hate'proper hate, for by the Martian 'map' you cannot possibly hate anything unless you grok it completely, understand it so thoroughly that you merge with it and it merges with youthen and only then can you hate it. By hating yourself. But this also implies, by necessity, that you love it, too, and cherish it and would not have it otherwise. Then you can <i>hate</i>and (I think) that Martian hate is an emotion so black that the nearest human equivalent could only be called a mild distaste.""<p>Mahmoud screwed up his face. ""It means 'identically equal' in the mathematical sense. The human clich, 'This hurts me worse than it does you' has a Martian flavor to it, if only a trace. The Martians seem to know instinctively what we learned painfully from modern physics, that the observer interacts with the observed through the process of observation. 'Grok' means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the process being observedto merge, to blend, to intermarry, to lose personal identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and scienceand it means as little to us as color means to a blind man.""",1344757604

The main reason would be the mp3 player does just the one thing I want, i.e. playing the sounds, and this is very power efficient; I wouldn't want to leave my PC / tablet / smartphone running this webpage.<p>Also, an mp3 player allows me to loop or create a playlist, for example with 'heavy thunder' at the time of night when I need the most noise-masking, and with 'light rain' when I need the least.<p>Finally - and, yes, I realise I might sound a bit kooky here - I want to be able to select my own loops and samples. Some mp3 sources for rain I've found on the 'net have lots of aliasing noise, and I simply can't sleep as my mind focuses on the artifacts rather than just drifting away.<p>A couple of the above points (especially the 'timed program' one) might be able to be addressed by your implementation. And while I think I'll stick with my implementation for now this is because I've already done the 'hard work' of setting something up; for 'beginner' or occasional noise-maskers, your site is a quick and easy solution.

All you need to be able to do is to produce the first byte of whatever would have been produced in the ""fallback case"", i.e. when the reader does not handle format negotiation. Then, when the writer sees that the reader supports format negotiation it will need to signal that the alternative format was chosen. I do this by sending a zero byte (which should never appear in the fallback text format).

I find such online discussions interesting, and certainly sometimes they might reveal better information than just going to your doctors office. But these are just people hanging out online - just because they vote something up doesn't mean it is proven, it just means they like to believe it. In fact, for any theory you can probably find an online community that believes in it and votes up things supporting that belief.<p>The latest studies I read about seem to indicate that low carb and so on are irrelevant, calorie reduction is all that counts. But if you want to believe in low carb, you can probably find lots of anecdotes proving its effectiveness. Possibly because the low carbers accidentally also reduced calorie intake. (Although my own criticism of those studies is that it remains unclear how differing diets allow you to keep calories low. One snickers bar might have enough calories for a day, but it would be difficult to just eat one snickers bar every day, contrary to eat lots of whole grains).",1344756696

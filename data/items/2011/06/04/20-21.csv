My freshman year here I got involved with a research group examining virtualization in high performance computing (supercomputing). By the end of my freshman year I had helped write a big patch for QEMU to virtualize Intel HW instructions and implemented the software compatibility layer for Intel in our own virtual machine monitor. In addition to the invaluable experience this gave me (especially in practical C) I also appeared as a coauthor on the VMM paper in a very prestigious systems conference (IPDPS).<p>In my sophomore year I was elected President of the Northwestern ACM chapter and tried to get more involved and invested in computer science at Northwestern. At the end of that year I also met Microsoft recruiters at a Northwestern job fair and went to work on SQL server over the summer.<p>This past year I co-taught my first class in security and network penetration at Northwestern and my co-lecturer and I  led our team to 8th/72 in the International Capture the Flag Contest (a worldwide university hacking competition). I also started working on the Racket programming language with Prof. Robby Findler. Later I met Google recruiters at a job fair this year and will be working in the Google Chicago office this summer as a result.<p>Next year I hope to complete my masters and finish a thesis in programming languages.<p>If someone doesn't think they want or need college that's perfectly fine with me but I wouldn't give up my college experiences for anything.",1307221090

You would definitely want to have a separate LLC for anything that is extremely risky or that is in a litigious industry (healthcare, etc.)  If your first app is just ""slightly profitable"", I wouldn't worry about it that much.  If you add other memmbers/managers in the future you can always restructure the ownership and compensation ratios, etc. - LLCs are amazingly flexible.<p>- I've used series LLCs several times (in IL and DE), and it was very helpful in a couple of cases and a complete clusterfuck in another.  Find a great lawyer if you opt to go that route.  You DEFINITELY have to use separate bank accounts and ledgers for every series if you want to get any of the advantages of the Series LLC structure.  Just trying to open Series-specific bank accounts can be an issue, surprisingly.  I would only use a Series LLC again for VERY specific purposes (mutual fund companies, etc.)",1307220582

2620386,comment,2619563,2619830,23,0,CamperBob,,,"<i>With the explosion of information and data collected about diseases, it is quite possible for a patient to walk in with a rare disease to be FAR more informed about his condition than any doctor.</i><p>That doesn't necessarily mean anything, though.  When I broke my collarbone last year, I joined a massive 'community' of patients with the most commonly broken bone in the human body.  Initially I thought it'd be easy to get advice online with regard to what to expect in terms of healing time, mobility, pain, and long-term outcome, and what therapies were most/least effective.  It wasn't.  What I found made me realize that self-diagnosing pretty much anything on the Internet, no matter how trivial, is a really bad idea... and that this is true <i>regardless</i> of whether the doctors have better advice to offer.<p>Even if the consensus of doctors, nurses, authors, coaches, and fellow sufferers was that ""Each case is different, so it's impossible to generalize about any of those things,"" that would've been fine.  Unsatisfying, but fine.  It would've been the correct conclusion for a new patient to reach.  But it wasn't.  If you look up clavicle fractures on the Web, you'll find a ridiculous array of claims, anecdotes, and received wisdom... and that's just in the peer-reviewed literature, never mind the various sports and health forums.<p>It turns out that nobody really knows the best way to treat collarbone fractures of a given type and severity.  Ultimately you just go back for x-rays every couple of months (weeks) until the doctor tells you you can (remove the sling carefully) (get back on the bike) (pick fights with bears.)   The nature and location of the fracture affects the prognosis, but doesn't have much to do with the treatment for those patients who don't opt for surgery.  Some doctors swear by sling type X, others by brace type Y.  Some doctors will yell at you to keep your sling on at all times; other doctors will tell you not to bother with it past the first three or four weeks unless you actually experience pain.  Some doctors say not to lift anything at all; others say it's OK to lift until it hurts.  The spectrum of advice given to patients who post essentially the same x-rays to various sports forums is amazing, as are the anecdotes ranging from ""I blew off the doctor and went swimming in 4 weeks, no problem"" to ""I followed the doctor's advice and ended up in painful/painless surgery six months/two years later.""<p>Again, none of this is unreasonable given the differences from one case to the next... <i>but you won't recognize this fact based on advice found online.</i>  What most people will be tempted to do is surf until they get an answer they like, and then walk away from the browser thinking they know more than they did when they sat down.<p>As an exercise, I recommend that even HN readers with intact clavicles spend a couple of hours researching the condition from the POV of a newly diagnosed patient.  You may not come away as disillusioned with the wisdom of the Internet as I did, but I believe you will think twice about the quality of online information if you're ever diagnosed with a serious, uncommon condition like Crohn's.  Sorry, Crohn's (and collarbone) patients -- sometimes the truth just isn't out there.",1307219503

I would recommend that you start learning Javascript and jQuery. They're both enjoyable and will seriously boost your front-end development skills, while getting you familiar with programming.<p>In the meantime, if you find a job that looks just slightly out of your reach, try applying anyway, and mention during your interview that you're learning Javascript in your spare time and really want the opportunity to develop your skills. If you have the code you're working/learning on available somewhere (either a zip file, GitHub, or SourceForge), you'll still be ahead of many candidates who say they have more experience.",1307218199

2620321,comment,2619751,2620260,6,0,mkramlich,,,"I'd guess that Nordmark taking over the CEO role from Veith was (1) prob a condition or recommendation of the newest round of investors (because Nordmark is more experienced and has the success of eBags under his belt), and (2) the event that enabled Nordmark to gain much more power and transparency over the books, which in turn was the final straw leading to the charges against Veith. This is just speculation based on the publically reported info we've seen, however, and I obviously could be wrong. Since Nordmark is clean and has succesful track record and UM got all the extra cash in April, that all seems to be a net positive for the company. I think the fundamental service delivered by UM is a good one, and unlocking the value in otherwise unused frequent flyer miles is especially helpful to travellers in a recession. Veith is also innocent until and unless courts find otherwise. And I think the TechStars folks are good at picking talent combined with promising venture ideas.",1307217735

They are a binding force, that tie us to our past and our future. They hold very little power and have to endure much responsibility (mentoring politicians, representing the country abroad, upholding the values and behavior expected of them) and suffer much inconvenience (media intrusion).<p>It is also very rare for a pledge of allegiance of any kind in the UK especially in schools (I understand it happens at citizenship ceremonies and in certain public office positions such MPs)  - the idea of school children pledging blind allegiance to an entity is pretty horrid in my opinion.",1372125512

The object-oriented features are now the industry standard.<p>Nobody wants to spend the time to learn these new languages if they don&#x27;t offer a significant improvement over Java and C#. Of the ones you listed, Scala is the most likely to succeed because it can interoperate smoothly with Java and offers concurrency features that Java does not.

In my opinion, functional programming suck on the &quot;understand every bit of the program&quot; metric given the amount of indirection in code (e.g. via higher-order functions, OO languages can suffer also via virtual dispatch and Hollywood principle architectures). However, they potentially excel at &quot;understand the program in the context of these understood abstractions&quot; metric.<p>Unfortunately, humans are very diverse in their abilities to learn and understand abstractions, especially ones that are based on math. So some people get FP very well, while many others seem to do better with the more naturalistic (i.e. based on natural language) abstractions such as objects. There are good reasons why OOP is more popular than FP beyond the vacuous &quot;they simply don&#x27;t get it&quot; arguments.",1372125360

After being apprehended on the Iran-Iraq border, Sarah Shourd, Josh Fattal, and I were held in Evin Prison&#x27;s isolation ward for political prisoners. Sarah remained there for 13 months, Josh and I for 26 months. We were held incommunicado. We never knew when, or if, we would get out. We didn&#x27;t go to trial for two years. When we did we had no way to speak to a lawyer and no means of contesting the charges against us, which included espionage.

Do I point out that I had a mattress, and they have thin pieces of foam; that the concrete open-air cell I exercised in was twice the size of the &quot;dog run&quot; at Pelican Bay, which is about 16 by 25 feet; that I got 15 minutes of phone calls in 26 months, and they get none; that I couldn&#x27;t write letters, but they can; that we could only talk to nearby prisoners in secret, but they can shout to each other without being punished; that unlike where I was imprisoned, whoever lives here has to shit at the front of his cell, in view of the guards?<p>It is a crazy, awful, and unnecessary black mark on America&#x27;s human rights record.

Mine are a bit different, though:<p>Hacker: explorer, exploiter, duct-taper, as you say.<p>Engineer: has a strong grasp of algorithms and &quot;the metal&quot;.  Often a good architect, but won&#x27;t tend to come up with great new designs.  May have trouble reading and working with non-engineers&#x27; code, or with nebulous &#x27;specs&#x27;.<p>Developer: if the Hacker is motivated by exploring the clever creations of others, the Developer is motivated by a vision of creating new things (cleverly if possible, but the realization of the vision is more important than the cleverness of the solution).  Can be a good architect (and UX designer) if they can learn to control their impulses to innovate, rewrite, and adopt bleeding-edge languages and libraries.<p>In this taxonomy, &quot;trustworthy and can sit down from 9-5 to do boring code work&quot; applies at least as often to Engineers as Developers; my archetype Hacker will start out with schedule/focus difficulties, but improve with age.  I think as each of the &#x27;classes&#x27; gains experience, especially in the presence of good examples of the other classes, they make progress in the other classes&#x27; areas of strength.  The Hackers and Developers get better at writing code the Engineers can stand to work with; the Engineers and Developers accumulate arcane knowledge; and the Hackers and Engineers see more of the space of possibility that their tools give them access to.",1372125321

Their culture, the tools, etc are all very inspiring, and the whole community definitely benefits from their experiments. This meme always gets me thinking about how to attract the best talent for our company.<p>That said, holding them up as a model of how to build a tech team never quite feels like a good idea.<p>GitHub is a developer product, built for developers by developers. That essentially makes all of their employees domain experts in the product as well. They can also robustly dog-food their product. Both of those factors in my opinion make it much easier to have a successful distributed team. They can trust everyone to make good decisions absent a strong product team.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at 5-6 different startups with varying levels of distributed teams and never felt that distributed communication of product, architecture, etc was ever as productive as with the co-located teams. Trying to involve the remote people always felt like &quot;extra work&quot; and it wasn&#x27;t a smooth process.<p>I would be very curious to hear from non-developer product companies about their successes (or failures) with remote teams. Are new tools like Google hangouts, shared whiteboards, and github really enough to allow you to have a productive product/engineering team?",1372124809

They&#x27;re marketing experiments with a small bit of technology and a lot of painful support work (due to massive, accumulating technical debt) that can only be done out of VC-istan dues-paying as young people take on pager duty for the job they think will get them investor connections in 6 months so they can do their own gigs (ha!)<p>The same thing is true about lots of Google (your favorite company) jobs. For many positions, they don&#x27;t need brilliant people hacking Lisp, but rather they need competent Java or C++ programmers to make sure that their code base is &quot;good enough&quot;. The result is that you get things like Google Calendar. What&#x27;s wrong with Google Calendar? John McCarthy put it best:<p>&quot;Now of course Emacs is merely and editor but nevertheless is does permit significant user modifications and the modern operating systems do not. Let me give an example: one thing that I have done is to add a feature where you can put in a file, the name of another file and even also a location in that file. And then with a single key press it will search forward till it finds its file name and go to that filename in place. And I use it for putting references to email messages in my calendar file. That&#x27;s just one of the uses of it and I asked about the new Google calendar file. Can you put a reference to email messages in there? And the answer is not only can&#x27;t the user do it, but even the implementers can&#x27;t do it, but to me anyway it&#x27;s very useful. When I receive email about a meeting or a seminar, or something like that, to be able to put a link to the email itself into the calendar file and Emacs permitted me to do that myself, without my even having to become a real expert in the inners of it, and I think this will be important. &quot;<p><a href=""http://www.infoq.com/interviews/mccarthy-elephant-2000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/mccarthy-elephant-2000</a><p>The quote is from clickbox 9.

Following that, build something with the language/database.<p>Reading stuff only online if it&#x27;s not official docs, can really burn you though (not that books can be any better at times, but books at least get reviews).

5936841,story,,,1,4,bluzard,"Ask HN: Should I transfer colleges?",,"Hi, I&#x27;m a undergrad who just finished my freshman year at a large state school (ranked in the 80s according to US News) with a solid CS department. My major is CS with minors in math and econ. I chose my school because it was the most affordable option. Academically, I am doing well (3.9/4.0 GPA). In my spare time I try to code as much; I&#x27;m learning R at the moment, but know Python (along with some Django), Java, Matlab, some C/C++, HTML5, and Javascript. I also started working in a Professor&#x27;s lab doing scientific computing in R/Matlab (and some Python). I would like to work in a startup one day or start my own. I&#x27;m particularly interested in machine learning/AI and its applications for robotics (i.e. computer vision) and computational biosciences/bioinformatics. Luckily, money is not an issue as it used to be. I&#x27;ve had thoughts of transferring since earlier in the year. I don&#x27;t mean to sound pretentious, but I personally feel that I can do &#x27;better&#x27;, and go to a more rigorous school. I&#x27;m interested in transferring to Rice, Brown, Cornell, Michigan, and the University of Virginia. Beyond the school&#x27;s network and rigour, is there any other benefit a more well known school provides? Does going to a school with exceptional peers really make a difference? I figure the only way to get better is to play a smarter opponent? There isn&#x27;t really a great startup scene at my school, but I know the schools I&#x27;ve listed have had more measures taken towards encouraging entrepreneurship, so perhaps there&#x27;s a greater chance of finding other founders. Does the name really matter? I sometimes feel I have to compensate for the lack of brand name value my school provides, such as when applying for internships. There&#x27;s not really a lot of on campus recruiting, so it&#x27;s more hustle from my side. I notice that my friends who go to brand name schools have fantastic alumni networks.",1372122412

Talent isn&#x27;t evenly distributed, but it is distributed. What&#x27;s most compelling for perhaps Valley and New York companies only, is the wide disparity with regard to compensation:<p>Two Silicon Valley startups raise $1M and they each have need for a great team. Team One is on site. They spend a lot of otherwise productive time attempting to hire great engineering talent away from other equally impressive startups in the area. They pay $150k per person (let&#x27;s call it $200k fully loaded) for talented, but not phenomenal people. Team Two is fully distributed. They decide to hire the best, no matter where they are, and at $150k per person <i>everyone</i> outside of Silicon Valley gives them a look with much less effort on their part. They save time, they save on office space in SV, and, best of all, they build a team of truly phenomenal folks who are happy to be making $150k, because it&#x27;s likely $50k higher than they were making at whatever job they had before they got recruited.<p>Assuming you can build a better <i>team</i> in the Valley is only relevant if you have a reasonable expectation that you&#x27;ll find similarly talented folks at the same price no matter where you are.

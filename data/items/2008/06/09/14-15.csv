212794,comment,212682,212775,0,0,swombat,,,"I'm not saying we won't be fine :-)<p>However, a thread like this is not a discussion. Of the bunch of replies other than my one (and its associated meta-discussion), every single one is a ""me too""-like statement that ""this is what I listen to"". And how could it be another way? We are all different people with different tastes and there is no singular ""hacker music"" that's best suited to programming.<p>So, an Ask-YC like this:<p>- doesn't bring anything new to the table in the OP (particularly since it's been done many times before)<p>- brings nothing in the comments<p>- is theoretically incapable of doing either anyway<p>Therefore, it's a complete waste of space. There could be an insightful article on the front page in its stead, but instead, all there is is this vacuous nothing. YC is worse for it, not better - YC thrives despite the presence of this kind of thread, not because of it.",1213022583

Seems to me no matter how much food production is raised, population growth will eventually catch up.<p>That's assuming that there is a natural limit to the amount of food that can be produced on the planet. Also, do we really want to reach that limit, or maybe we all live more comfortable if we can stop population growth before that?",1213022495

Ever since, It’s been a constant learning experience. When I advanced from website coding to directly interacting with clients, I was taking a pretty big step. It was hard enough trying to understand this crazy markup language, and now I had to learn how to interact with clients? Sheesh. Thanks to trial and error, I’ve come to understand a few things about establishing and maintaining the best possible relationship with my clients.",1213022443

You are not alone.<p>My condolences for your loss.<p>I have been in this position several times, so I'll share my thoughts, which may or may not help.  That's the biggest thing: everybody's different.<p>In my experience, there's not a whole lot of healing that happens.  Time does not heal.  Time ""eases"".  So you have to let that happen organically.  Postpone your finals.  Put your startup on hold.  It's OK.  (OTOH, some people need something to do but that's not me.)<p>Get another room.  You shouldn't have to relive that day every time you go home.<p>Be supportive of your roommate's family; they need you now.  Do whatever you can to help them .<p>Get counseling.  You don't need Dr. Phil or Oprah.  Just a stranger with some credentials who knows when to listen and when to shut up.  You'll probably want to talk, so you'll need a good listener who'll know just what to say to help you along your path.  I have found group sessions especially helpful; it was always comforting to know that others were going through (almost) the same thing.<p>Most of all, let things happen as they do.  Some of us find comfort sooner than others.  Don't be surprised by how you react; you just don't know.<p>All any of us ever gets is x days.  Although your life will never be the same, I wish you the best in resuming living your x-n days as soon as you're ready.<p>(If you find help from books, an excellent resource is ""When Bad Things Happen to Good People"" by Harold Kushner.)",1213021159

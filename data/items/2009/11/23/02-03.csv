Either a coworker needs to talk to you about something, you need to get up to go talk to someone, or you end up interrupting yourself when you should focus on working by checking email, browsing to a website, or any million other things.<p>To improve your attention span, you need to work at removing as many of these restrictions as you can.  Since you can't control the external distractions - coworkers, meetings, etc., that means you have to focus on the ones under your control.  So for start, pay attention to what you're doing at any given time as you work and try to reduce the number of times you interrupt yourself.",1258945184

She told me that the strange thing is that many of these children are good with computers and frighteningly addicted to YouTube. Apparently there is an entire community of autistic people making videos for other autistic people.

They do things like read the contents of movie jackets on film, zooming in on each photo one by one.

You might say that these companies should have a full blown CMS implemented, but often times all they want is document versioning, and CMS solutions like Sharepoint are expensive and can be confusing. There might be a market there but it would be hard to identify the individual customers amid a generally well-served market.  The company that I was working with literally used a network share with documents organised in folders and renamed for each version. <i>shudder</i>. They were looking at Alfresco when I left, but I doubt they'll get the project off the ground - it's too big. If this was a really really simple SELF-HOSTED package, I'm sure they would go for it.

956635,comment,956108,956176,0,0,Mz,,,"I didn't tell my kids there are bad people in the world who want to do unspeakable things to them.  I felt that would rob them of their innocence.  Instead, I had a strict rule in my home that all affection had to be by mutual consent and 'no' means 'no'.  It was their decision and they didn't need to justify it.  If they didn't want a 'goodnight' kiss or hug on a particular night, no big deal.  If anyone refused to take 'no' for an answer, they were to come get me. I had to back up this promise only once.  My kids extrapolated for themselves that this meant they were entitled to enforce the rules with physical force if necessary when mom was unavailable (ie when they were in public school).  I didn't hear such stories until many years later.  They never thought it was anything that needed to be mentioned.<p>In short:  If a kid has good boundaries and is empowered to act on their judgment without having to articulate why (which is often difficult even for adults and can be impossible for a kid), the odds are relatively small they will be victimized in some significant way.  Even a toddler can decide if they want a goodnight kiss and can signal that by enthusiastically turning towards you and throwing their arms wide open or by turning their face away if the answer is 'no'.  Respecting that instinct and cultivating it is tantamount to an invisible shield which will keep out most predators.  And it's not just protection against potential sexual predation.  It generalizes.",1258943422

Whereas most, if not all, of what you mention is at least contained in a single partition and in swap, and thus can be protected by full-disk encryption, creating a new hidden partition to store secret backups is violating expectations quite badly.<p>I choose to use a secure directory rather than full-disk as part of a security/performance tradeoff, and so I know that there are temp files and caches and swaps all over the place (though GnuPG is setuid so that it can lock pages in memory, thus preventing them from going to swap-- an attacker would have to freeze my RAM to get to my keyring). Most of these, though, should at least be manageable. I can see them and interact with them.<p>I do agree that in some sense TrueCrypt isn't doing its job, but I argue that's because their expectations have also been violated.

It's somewhat out of date but still very good.  I work at a high-frequency trading shop and that is the first book they shove at you when you walk in the door.<p>Other than that, I'd like to second what several other people have already said: getting a job at a firm is a good way to learn, you're outgunned in terms of brains and money, and 10k is probably too little.  Now, you can do a lot of learning for 0k while you save money, and every startup is outgunned by goog, msft, but that doesn't mean there isn't room in the ecosystem.  Like a startup against an established player, you could find a niche that is going unexploited.  What makes trading harder is the established players don't tell you much about what they're doing, so you don't know if you are doing something new or walking into a trading strategy perfected 10 years ago by DE Shaw.  With a software startup, you have more information about what your competitors are selling, what their products are, how you might differentiate yourself, what's missing from the internet, etc.  Software companies promote their products and try to get public attention; trading shops try to keep as many secrets as possible.",1258941860

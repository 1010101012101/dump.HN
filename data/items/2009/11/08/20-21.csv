Great work keeping it simple -- not enough of that these days.<p>Edit: Just noticed something playing around with it.  Is there a way to correct its results if it doesn't happen to get them right?  For example, I searched for <i>All That You Are</i> by Mudvayne, and the only result that gets queued is an 8-second intro.<p>I like the ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" simplicity, but there should probably be a way to fix the choice -- e.g., a button on the song for ""not the right one"" that expands a list of search results.",1257713979

If you take a step back to first principles and start with a reasonable goal such as ""I want to feel better and live longer"" then zeroing in on losing weight is not necessarily the most effective path.  For obese people it might be, but for normal people getting regular exercise and eating right (which varies by individual) will have a much more positive effect than obsessing over weight.<p>Furthermore, telling people to count calories and not worry about the quality of what they eat is just opening the door for that same destructive human behavior of eating whatever crap they want, just in limited quantities.  This is not the road to health.  No amount of engineering mentality will get around the fuzziness of health or the stubbornness of human nature.  Fortunately people are capable of being honest with themselves to varying degrees, and it is possible to improve one's health by a commitment to exercise and healthy eating.",1257712826

What terrorism has shown us is that it doesn't even require nation-states.<p>So your nation can be so inept as to not be able to control things inside it's borders (many nations fit this bill). If armed camps build up inside them and attack other countries, guess what? You're at war -- or something so close to war as to be indistinguishable from it.<p>If you'd like the world to work like some super-big version of your local country, where most conflicts are solved by some civil system, then you're going to have to have popular choice of representatives, mixed local, national, and world control, an independent court system built on something besides treaties, etc. The UN is nowhere near any of that.<p>There is the theory that democracies only compete via commerce. If you buy into that, then perhaps a world full of democracies would be the most peaceful. But I don't see that happening either any time soon.<p>It's just a long-shot. A real long-shot. I'd argue that in order to do away with war you would have to do away with 99.999% of the impetus for using violence under any circumstances. It'd be a world of extreme pacifists. Would that be such a great thing? Doesn't chaos -- whether war, sickness, disasters, etc -- contribute to evolution and growth? Do we really want to live in stasis? Or -- to put it in religious terms -- is heaven really such a great thing?",1257711043

They would much rather  believe that an hour or two of exercise per week, or eating 'good' foods, will let them eat as much as they want and still lose weight. The reality is that if you want to lose weight, you're going to be hungry for a while - it isn't pleasant, but that's the way the body works.<p>I lost 50lbs by controlling my diet, so anecdotally I know it works. But try explaining that to people, and it's like talking to a brick wall. It's a bit depressing to see the amount of unscientific nonsense spouted on this thread.

It's similar to my political beliefs, where I an extremely distasteful of people with extremist beliefs.<p>Think of it as my being against negativity. I'm okay with everything but people who put other people down. And smug assholes can defend themselves well; idiots can't, so I defend them instead.<p>EDIT: I don't think that's quite a cohesive answer, so let me elaborate. I like productive criticism. I've spent a lot of time here criticizing Twitter in the past, especially when it was first growing, because I really don't see the use in it myself beyond for publicity purposes. I don't write shortform very often, so why Twitter was better than a communal blogging system struck me as odd. Similarly, I criticize a lot here and very willingly throw myself into arguments.<p>Where I draw the line is when people make blanket statements against people they don't know. I understand that's a paradoxical concept, but there's no better way to put it. I also dislike smugness. So criticizing, say, Robert Scoble for being very overearnestly wrong and overreaching when he writes a silly article, that's fine. What wouldn't be fine is making a statement like ""Scoble shouldn't ever write again,"" because it implies that just because somebody's wrong about something should mean they shouldn't try again. I prefer criticism that encourages people to try again, criticism that's potentially constructive.<p>So I support the masses, even when they're dumb, and I'll go out of my way to criticize people who've got the antiquated attitude that having somebody stupid on the Internet somehow brings the whole Internet down. That's a negativity I can do without; I'd like to see that converted into more earnest criticism in the hopes that those masses become enlightened rather than ticked off that people they don't know are putting them down.<p>I see it in real life, on occasion, when I meet people who're big into 4chan and Reddit, and it makes me want to hit them. I lost that smugness when I met Internet People in real life and realized they were people, not degenerates; other people carry that smugness over and act like what they type online allows them to spit on other people who care about other things more. Those other people don't care enough to respond, so I provide my viewpoint in the hopes that it'll quell things.",1257710728

The macbook arrived on, with photoshop still running, a dvd in the drive, and a different name on the user account than the sellers. I called Apple, and they confirmed it was stolen by the serial number. So I got in touch with the laptop's owner via some googling, and found out it had been stolen just two weeks ago.<p>I filed a dispute with PayPal, and the seller immediately offered me a $100 rebate, which I declined. Then PayPal resolved the case, saying that I should send the laptop back to the seller, and my money would be refunded, with a 10 day time limit. This seemed crazy, and then for 8 days they ignored my emails, and to my first two phone calls just said they'd update the dispute with the information I'd provided on the phone, but never did. Then I reached someone reasonable at PayPal, and they credited me back the full amount and told me to send the laptop to its owner.<p>So it worked out, but it was a huge pain, and for a long time I thought I was going to have to choose between doing the right thing and getting my money back.<p>Also, the owner of the laptop contacted his police department the day I emailed him with the name, address and phone number of the seller. It took a week to get a phone call with the detective, who then refsued to contact PayPal. Now he's been waiting a week to get an address from the detective that I can send the laptop to.",1257710473

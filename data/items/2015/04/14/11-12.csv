When I tell people my idea I generally get asked; &quot;do developers bookmark differently than anyone else?&quot;. And the answer is no. But I do believe (and am in the process of verifying) that developers bookmark to a greater extent than most other people, particularly web developers. So I want to build a bookmarking tool specifically for developers although initially I don&#x27;t expect any significant differences between my tool and a more general bookmarking tool. But as I progresses I expect to discover what developer centric features people find useful (this might just be simple things like integration with collaboration tools). This idea has come about because I still, after many years, find the bookmarking process lacking (and I&#x27;m familiar with various options for bookmarking).<p>So at the moment I&#x27;m looking for feedback on whether people think if there is any value to this idea – so any comments on that would be appreciated. Also I&#x27;m trying to figure out what developers think of bookmarking and how they currently do it; so I created a survey but at this point I&#x27;ve exhausted my own network so I&#x27;m in need of some developers who like helping others out! I&#x27;ll be releasing the results of said survey once it&#x27;s completed so I think it will hopefully be useful for others regardless of whether I continue with my idea or not.<p>The survey is at the following address:<p>https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/dev-bookmark-survey<p>Thanks for reading!",1429011944

It&#x27;s not trying to be a swiss army knife, and if your use case requires a threaded language then Node.js certainly isn&#x27;t the tool for that job. But it might find a useful place in your toolbox for other tasks.<p>2. require() is part of the CommonJS spec, and how it physically works is dependent on the implementation. You point out that Node&#x27;s implementation doesn&#x27;t work well in the browser, but Node itself does not work in the browser so that point is moot. I agree that it might be interesting to load remote modules in Node, but keeping that operation synchronous does simplify the language quite a bit.<p>3. You can also map modules to public or private git repositories in the package.json, as long as the private key used during npm install has access. If the git repo has tags, a tag can be specified in the git uri as well. Private npm repos are the superior way to distribute private modules with wider access, but I think this is handled fairly cleanly already.",1429011307

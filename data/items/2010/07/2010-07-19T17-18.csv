You're going to need to pick one city and walk all around it getting people to use your service, putting up flyers, doing a radio interview, trying to get the mayor of the city onboard, convincing college kids to swap their stuff on there or to meet for board games... you'll have to seed that one city with your own offers, meetup groups, get your friends to post their resumes or job offers on there, etc, etc, etc. This almost certainly can't be done from behind a keyboard.<p>Craigslist isn't winning by its technology - the technology stays out of Craigslist's way while the site wins by community and network effects. You need that. You can't get there via technology, you need to take over one city Craigslist is underserving, then repeat the process a few times until you've got some solid beachheads in place.",1279562307
1529520,comment,1528614,1528614,0,0,btilly,,,"What is sad is to see a company with a competitive advantage fail to see it and throw it away.<p>I used to work at Rent.com.  A key competitive advantage is that its revenue cycle is wrong.  When it started its competitors all made money as soon as they referred someone.  Rent.com only made money after the person was referred, leased, reported it to us, the apartment was contacted, and the apartment paid.  Optimizing for this was difficult, but once Rent.com had traction none of its competitors could afford to switch models because that would open them up for apples to apples comparisons, with a company that had already been optimized, when they didn't even know how to track that data!<p>Then Rent.com got a new, well-funded, competitor called MyNewPlace.com with deep industry connections.  Same model.  Some people there used to be at Rent.com.  Absolutely no idea how to implement.  This is where Rent.com should have increased their spend on advertising to the point where the unoptimized upstart was losing money on every sale and Rent.com was making money.  Wait until the competitor went under.  Then cut back on advertising.<p>Unfortunately Rent.com had been purchased by eBay, eBay didn't understand Rent.com's business model, and so Rent.com was forced to squeeze margins.  This gave MyNewPlace all the time in the world to figure out the business model.  Worse yet, Rent.com put someone in charge of internet advertising who completely didn't understand affiliate relationships (even at break-even they are profitable because of positive SEO), and that self-inflicted wound only helped MyNewPlace more.<p>It was a great competitive advantage.  No competitor should have been allowed to flourish.  But if you don't understand your competitive advantage, it is easy to throw it away.  And they did.",1279562298

1529448,comment,1528613,1528613,0,0,headius,,,"I can comment on the JRuby results.<p>For the base perf numbers, I'm not surprised. We've known that we're roughly on par with 1.9.2 for some time, and many of the benchmarks in question have started to reach a point of irreducible complexity (e.g. you can only slice and dice strings so fast). It's good to see JRuby remains at or near the front of the pack as far as performance, especially considering we've made no major performance-related changes in almost two years.<p>The Linux versus Windows numbers are a bit surprising to me. If I were to make a guess, I'd guess that the JVMs used were not identical (perhaps like Isaac Gouy mentions, one platform was 64-bit and the other wasn't) or some other detail altered the performance characteristics of the test. But the performance drop does seem to be in line with other implementations, so perhaps Windows really does suck and there's not much we can do about it.<p>On the memory issue, I have a few recommendations.<p>JRuby by default allows the JVM to use up to a 512MB heap (the default is usually 32-64MB, which is rarely enough for most nontrivial apps). The JVM likes to use as much memory as you're willing to give it, to keep GC times low (nearly free) and to give it lots of room to breathe. Almost all these benchmarks could run in far less memory (maybe 1/5 as much or lower) if the JVM were choked down to that level. So it's not surprising to me that the memory sizes for these very object and CPU-intensive benchmarks start to approach that 512MB limit; the JVM is just stretching its legs.<p>Expect to see a lot more performance work coming in JRuby 1.6. I've blogged about it here: <a href=""http://blog.headius.com/2010/05/kicking-jruby-performance-up-notch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.headius.com/2010/05/kicking-jruby-performance-up...</a><p>Also expect to see more work on picking a ""winner"" as far as lightweight servers go.

While my then-boyfriend/now-husband was out of the country, some guys came by their apartment and beat up the guy and shot him in the ear (as he ran away) and held his pregnant girlfriend up at gunpoint and ran away right next to me, because I was outside walking my dog.  After that ordeal, they moved but since they still had the lease, they moved their drug dealer friends in.  A few months in someone shot into the apartment from the street.  We weren't home but the bullet holes actually came in diagonally through our shared wall.<p>We know they were drug dealers because 1) a neighbor of ours bought from them and 2) the cops pretty much told us but they didn't arrest them bc you can't without proof.  Like you said, this has nothing to do with doing drugs or legalization, but is about being near criminals who are consorting with other criminals.<p>For me, I would never bother trying to get them ""caught"".  For one, it's unlikely you'll succeed.  Two, you're just getting yourself more into that business.  Lastly, I wouldn't want to piss of a potentially dangerous drug dealer.<p>What we did is move and that's actually my recommendation, especially if you aren't too attached to your house.  I realize it's a lot of time and money but it isn't worth your family's safety.  It was enough for us to move (and lose money doing so) when it was just me and SO but I would never EVER stay in that situation with a child.  Nowadays, I live in a small tight-knit community with an overactive police force.  Some people find it restrictive but I find it SAFE.",1279560267

Second, I think the biggest challenge you'll have with a site like this is bootstrapping content. I would consider doing a couple things.. Maybe make recent posts in any category for a city prominent maybe.. to show activity. I'd also strongly consider whether or not you can make your tool backward compatible.. If posting on swippet could cross-post on craigslist for me.. that's a big win, right? Why not use swippet as my portal in that case... The other way would be handy too..

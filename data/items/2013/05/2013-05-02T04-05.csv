Having met many members of both groups in real life, the reprappers are generally more approachable. I get the impression that every CNC build is a custom design ""because I can"" whereas most reprappers tend to stick to a few common designs and possibly modify them. Modifications that work generally spread back to the community really really fast and improve life for everyone. The #reprap IRC channel on freenode is an absolute goldmine of a resource, people with questions or problems generally get answers within seconds and it's active, fun discussion the rest of the time.

And the negatives are curtailed by the short, high-population, transactional nature of message boards.  When someone corrects you on Hacker News, it doesn't make you feel stupid (I hope): it just means that someone out there, among the hundreds of thousands of readers, had better information than you did.  There's no real jockeying for social status on Hacker News, because if you get karma or score that point - who cares?  You never see them again.<p>That's very different from a school environment, where you are pushing your comfort zone in front of a small number of classmates, and a correction can make you feel stupid and negatively impact your confidence.

While the system as a whole might be eventually consistent (where consistency is defined as: what's in the General Ledger), it doesn't follow that you relax constraints on the parts.<p>The individual components are generally ACID and the steps to move data are ACID as well. The only thing that prevents the whole system from being ACID is that transactions don't go immediately from POS/ATMs/card clearance/cheque clearance into the General Ledger, but instead must go through a series of intermediate transactions. But those intermediate transactions must, themselves, be ACID.<p>That's why I talked about how the boundaries matter. The final central accounts are ACID, the subsystems are ACID and the data transfers are ACID.<p>edit: though to contradict myself, I expect that there will be counterexamples in different banks where some stores or steps will not be strictly ACID, but will have been ""good enough"" or with sufficiently-acceptable workarounds that they haven't been upgraded.

First, let me say thanks as well, as I like your product and have sent people your way when they ask about something like PortableApps.com for local software.  I'd also like to make clear that I in no way have a problem with the way Ninite works.  I just had a problem with the way this article was written.  Looking back at my original post, I definitely wrote a few things incorrectly and I apologize for that.<p>Regarding profits XOR good, I agree that you can do both and hope it didn't seem like I was implying otherwise.  PortableApps.com, though fully open source, is also a for-profit venture that also intends to do good.  It just happens to not be turning a profit yet.  We're working on a freemium model as well, but we decided against making our updater and app store a paid feature and against bundling in ads as it would negatively impact some of our users.<p>I was unaware that Adobe had accessibility issues but, considering the interface, it makes sense.  So, let me commend you on assisting with that.  We did some custom work to ensure accessibility in our products as we have a large contingent of folks it helps as well.<p>Regarding publishers making updating their software artificially hard, I'm with you on that.  We've had more than one publisher refuse to appear in the PortableApps.com App Store and Updater for that very reason: they want to have users to visit their website on each new version to see offers.  That's why the portable version of the app that's not on Ninite isn't available on PortableApps.com either, despite offering up possible alternative revenue streams and offering capabilities.  So, we're in the same boat there.<p>We should have a chat sometime and see if there are any ways we could work together.",1367470050

There's an American mindset that has its plusses and minuses (like any mindset), but the ability to combine the plusses of the American mindset (entrepreneurship, risk taking, ""fake it until you make it"") with the plusses of foreign mindsets (in my case: high value on community, stubbornness, practicality) can be a potent mix.<p>> The quality-of-life/cost-of-living ratio is now much higher elsewhere<p>I'm reminded of when I lived in NYC, and friends would ask how I could afford it. My answer was that you value different things differently when price informs your choices. My first years in NYC I didn't have cable, didn't have a car, and even used dial-up from home. I didn't mind, though, because there was plenty to do without TV, easy public transit everywhere, and lots of cafes and libraries with network connections.<p>Similarly, I've found that where I am now a lot of things are cheaper (fruits, vegitables, dining out...medicine and health care) and some are much, much more expensive (cars, gasoline).

5642453,comment,5641799,5641799,3,0,mindcrime,,,"Definitely worth a watch.  Interestingly, they agreed on quite a bit.  The one thing I was struck by, was the extent to which they agreed that government regulation was an inhibitor of innovation.  Actually, I expected that from Thiel, since he's well known as a libertarian, but I wasn't sure that pmarca would share that viewpoint.  But they both came down pretty hard on government in that regard.<p>I think both agreed that energy is of critical importance as well, and that the nature of the energy markets have had a big impact on shaping progress in other areas.<p>Also, I think Peter Thiel made a fairly interesting point about the connection between our imagination (as a culture) and Hollywood's portrayal of technology.  It <i>is</i> a little odd that some of the most well-known and popular movies with a large technological element are the ones where the machines are coming to kill us.  I'm sitting here right now trying to think up some good counter-examples, and am coming up fairly blank so far...<p>Something else that Peter Thiel mentioned at least twice was the phrase ""risk averse"".  I think that's a pretty important point... as a society, have we become so risk averse that we aren't willing to gamble on the big breakthroughs anymore?  Are we content to just sit back and wait and hope for a steady stream of incremental, sustaining innovations?  I think he might be onto something with that.<p>Edit:  Something that neither Thiel nor Andressen mentioned, that I think is relevant to this discussion, is the recent re-emergence of the hobbyist / DIY / amateur scientist / solo hacker/builder movement.  Hackerspaces, cheap embedded / embeddable computers, Arduino, Beagleboard, rPi, 3D printing, cheap DIY CNC milling machines, etc, are enabling thousands or millions of people to take a stab at building things they never could have tried to build before.  And go visit the recent HN thread on ""Hardware startups"" and the CDixon post...  looking at what an entrepreneur can do now, in terms of having a physical product built at scale with a much smaller capital investment than in the past... that's got to encourage some new companies to form, and some people to start working on ideas and dreams they've been stewing no, no?  And hardware devices aside, cheap computers, cheap Internet access, Open Source software, etc., are making it so much easier for people to explore their software and virtual ideas as well.<p>But, then we'd be back to Peter's point that ""we got 140 chars"".  So, is it lack of imagination, or something else, that's keeping us from getting radical, disruptive breakthroughs? Or are they out there, on the cusp, just... about... to... happen.",1367467493

I've observed this behavior in friends, colleagues, and in myself. When learning about someone's lack of knowledge, it's very common for the other party to react with ""Really?! You don't know xyz??"" I think 99% of the time the person saying this is not <i>actually</i> surprised, and does not <i>actually</i> need confirmation by asking again ""You don't know xyz??"" It's just a social tic ends up being kind of exclusionary and negative.<p>> Just tell participants that they may encounter people from a variety of backgrounds, and they should not assume that every understands what everyone else is talking about.<p>This is fine and well, and I'm sure the people running HS would agree with this, but tbh it is a little obvious sounding. The thing with avoiding ""feigning surprise"" is that some people (like myself!) might not even realize that they do this. After I read about this rule of theirs last year, I've been trying to cut down and was a bit saddened to realize how much I do it.<p>It's a pretty similar attitude to this comic, in the sense of adding a twist to the more general form the rule that you proposed.

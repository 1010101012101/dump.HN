I started freelancing a few months ago after my stint as a single founder. One of my first clients was a HN member for whom I did remote contract work for almost a couple of months.<p>I am proficient with Ruby on Rails and generally quite adept at picking up new technologies as per the needs of the product. I call myself a generalist, and if you are a non-technical person, I can handle most of the things for you that go in to building & launching a software product (including screen flows, server-side programming, system administration, analytics & a little bit of digital marketing.)<p>To give an example of me trying out new things, my current gig is related to conversion optimization(s) and driving growth for a startup in the education domain. I am up for any work that is challenging & stimulating.<p>I am open to a potential co-founder role as well, but as you know well, a lot of things need to fall in place for it. I guess it would be best if we work together on a short project first to see how good we are as a team.<p>Please see my profile for the contact & other relevant information. Just drop a line to say hello, it's always good to interact with fellow HN members!",1357106371

4995491,comment,4994876,4995228,2,0,ruswick,,,"I think one's interpretation of ""poor"" rests primarily on location. This is for two reasons. First, location determines absolute cost of living, and can effect quality of life. 40k might be above the median, but it barely livable in Manhattan. Location also has a bearing on relative perception of wealth. Someone making 40k in a neighborhood populated with people making 100k will make one feel poor.<p>Ultimately, the word ""poor"" is too subjective and is interpreted too idiosyncratically, and I try to avoid using it (along with words like ""smart"" and ""good"", etc.)",1357105761

4995484,comment,4992808,4994295,1,0,venus,,,"Well, if you're managing your rails app like that, you're running against the grain. Most rails apps should and, from what I know, are, being maintained at or near the latest stable version (currently 3.2.9). It's very much against rails best practise not to keep up to date, IMO.<p>Any fast-evolving framework is a bit of a moving target - see android and iOS as well, not to mention HTML5, jquery, apps written in anything fast-moving needs constant minor maintenance to keep up. That said, there's no reason a rails 1 app won't run today just like it always has.<p>One of the reasons rails can move so fast while avoiding bloat is its aggressive cutting of deprecated code. That has always been part of the rails way and I believe most rails devs are strongly in favour of this policy.",1357105529

I suspect such high bids are placed by customers of the spot instances who absolutely do not want their workload terminated early by Amazon and are willing to take the risk of paying more to run it to completion.<p>If you are a webapp though, like Pinterest, you don't have this desire.

4995479,comment,4992401,4993223,2,0,nostrademons,,,"FWIW, I have a longtime friend with her share of mental issues, and I have a family history of codependency.  I've tried dating her twice, and each time I've broken things off with something vaguely akin to ""I love you, but we're spiraling down into codependency and this is not healthy for either of us, and so I can't be in a relationship with you or get close to you.""<p>I'm still friends with her, but not particularly eager to try again with a relationship.  We try to see each other once every month or two to catch up on each others' lives, but otherwise aren't in regular contact (because when we are in regular contact, bad things happen).  Both of us are dating other people.<p>Also, back when I was a teenager I had many of the same mental issues she did.  (Perhaps that's why I latched onto her, and why we have such a tendency toward codependency.)  What helped me recover from them was not the people who did the darndest to help and bent over backwards for me, at the expense of their own well-being.  That tended to actively make things worse.  Rather, it was having adults in my life who served as solid role models, secure in themselves and their own lives, who would interact with me as a person but still set very firm boundaries.  And they were relentlessly patient about this.  It took about 5 years.  You can't be relentlessly patient with someone for 5 years unless you are simultaneously taking care of yourself and carrying on with your own life.",1357105381

I designed the product and can tell you that the casing isn't bulky, it's 1.5mm thick all around which is less than some iPhone cases. I also made it super quick and easy to open the door to get to your iPhone's touch screen and the iPhone app we are working on will allow you a lot of flexibility in what the buttons trigger. The buttons allow for fast forwarding, skipping and album/artist skipping, basically how long you hold down the button takes you up levels in the music directory and of course it works with other apps such as Pandora as well. I can also tell you that people that were at first skeptical tried it out and commented that the UI for most music/podcast listening was a bit superior in that everything was just a thumb press away. Granted, this product isn't for everyone, but I don't think it should be so quickly dismissed as we've spent a lot of time on the UI, electronics and firmware and app to make a great experience. Don't be fooled by the retro-styling aspect as that was simply a design decision.

I also came across the GetAround guys with a Tesla Roadster and asked if I could have my friend sit in it and get some photos and they were cool. So long story short. The best way to spruce up your screenshots is to just get out there with a camera and and try out interesting things and ask people if you can take their photos. After that, use Photoshop or any other photo editing package to color balance crop and apply any effects to make the image pop and I'm sure you'll get some really great imagery.\n-Dean",1322900045

FCC Licensing: There is an issue with FCC licensing in that you have to make sure your equipment has proper shielding, broadcasts in the right frequencies, etc. As long as the thing is considered one unit physically, even if the radio parts aren't yours and were already certified, it still has to be certified. Laptop manufacturers can get away without it by having the wireless card be a separate board that plugs into a slot under the laptop. Could Raspberry Pi do the same? Perhaps, but that's still a change of design, possible extra costs in design/layout, software, and parts.<p>2. Software: As anyone who's used linux for over a few years can attest, much of the firmware of wifi chips are a sort of black box and making software to work with a given chip is a nightmare unless you are working with the manufacturer. Why they didn't partner with a particular chipset manufacturer could boil down to price. They got lucky with the cheap licensing for the CPU and perhaps couldn't get something similar with wifi or didn't feel that it was worth the effort for all the extra space, cost, and design issues for this first version.",1322899251

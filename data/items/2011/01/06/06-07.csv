A distant relative (who had a seven year old and was pregnant with baby #2) repeated her worries about vaccines to me over Thanksgiving, and when I told her there was no real link to autism she reacted somewhat skeptically, so I told her to read _Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure_, which discusses why people want to associate vaccines and autism.<p>The shortest, most obvious version is that most people have trouble disentangling correlation and causation: kids tend to develop obvious signs of autism around the same time they get vaccines. So people think one causes the other when they don't.<p>Furthermore, most people don't have the training or inclination to really study the data. Journalism, in the meantime, promotes the ""two sides of the controversy"" school of writing, which often works well for politics and other areas without clear right answers. This works appallingly poorly in matters of science, where right answers are often demonstrably right but non-scientists have trouble distinguishing between competing claims, especially when multiple credentialed sources make compelling-seeming arguments. For more on this, see James Fallows' recent discussion in another context: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/year-end-bonus-more-scientist-on-scientist-smackdown/68647"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/year-e...</a> .<p>You can see the same kind of thinking in reporting on global climate change, which is almost certainly happening and being caused or accelerated by things we're doing. Yet you often see a climate scientist discussing this, on which there's widespread consensus (and consensus that more study is still needed) followed by a bogus climate skeptic. Same thing for vaccines. People hear this stuff in the air and repeat vague claims at family gatherings, but most of them (and us) don't really understand them.",1294296606
2074371,comment,2074044,2074089,0,0,rubyrescue,,,"This is fascinating and I want to respond on two levels - technical/SEO and moral/emotional. I consulted for the main competitor to these guys until a few months ago so I can speak only generally but I know the subject with some authority.<p>1. Anyone reading this post is not the target market for this. The real target market are the suckers that they can convince to take out $40,000 in unforgivable government student loans when they enroll at University of Phoenix. Your client is a vehicle for UofP to find these people. It's a very lucrative business for both companies BUT IT IS FOR MOST OF THEIR CLIENTS A SCAM. The people they need are low-income, not tech-savvy, and IRONICALLY, not savvy about the true value of the degree that Online Degrees is selling.<p>2. Please read the reviews (for instance for Ashford University) <a href=""http://www.guidetoonlineschools.com/online-reviews/ashford-university"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guidetoonlineschools.com/online-reviews/ashford-u...</a> and note that, with rare exceptions, the only positive reviewers are sock puppets.<p>3. Yet one of the things I don't get is how there could be so many bad reviews and yet people keep signing up. Unfortunately it's probably <i>because</i> of content like this, where the ""value"" of the degree is shown as ""millions of dollars"" and not ""a slightly higher than minimum wage job (that is not much better than the one i had before) with $40,000 of debt I can't escape even in bankruptcy"". I'm NOT exaggerating - please watch the Frontline special on these schools - <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/collegeinc/view/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/collegeinc/view/</a><p>4. I don't want to pick on you. It's a massive US Government federal student loan subsidy system - handing out essentially free money - that makes this system such a mess and makes the prospective students $30-50k ""marks"" for the ""schools"". I personally couldn't take direct part in it anymore but I don't begrudge anyone because it's a system that's broken, some small % of students find it valuable, and these adults are not being forced to go to these schools.<p>Putting emotion aside for a second and talking about the SEO:<p>1. The SEO technique you're describing - take public data, build it out with cheaply hired content, and stock photos, is great. That works well and everyone serious (particularly this space, because there is so much data) is doing similar stuff to stay at the top.<p>2. HNers doing SEO should note that you always have two target markets when you build content - SEO content for people who will backlink to and tweet about that content, and content for the actual users of the site. People looking for an online degree or buying insurance don't tweet and blog (with no-nofollowed links) about it - so you need to put content that SOMEONE ELSE will write about. That doesn't mean the people who link to that content may ever consider using the products your site is selling.<p>In technology often those two groups are the same; in almost every other area of the web, they're not. Tech guys often don't realize this because their only experience with online content is reading HN and TechCrunch and they see all the consumers of the site's main content tweeting about it. <i>But when was the last time you tweeted about your car insurance?</i><p>3. In my SEO consulting, every project is surprisingly, 80% technology and about 20% content. Tech guys are building systems to make massive creation of ""useful"" content possible, writers are getting paid small amounts to crank out the articles. This trend is accelerating, which ironically makes it a great time for a tech person to be in SEO - the opportunities to crunch data are only growing.",1294296577

I prefer Muay Thai, but any competitive fighting sport is good, and almost any city will have some variety of boxing gym available.<p>It's a good skill to have in general, but it's difficult to beat in terms of a workout (especially if you go to a gym that doesn't coddle).  When I run, sometimes I get lazy and go slowly for a bit.  When working the bag, though, I slow down and the guy that runs the gym will notice and yell.  Even better, when sparring, if you slow down and get lazy, you will get hit, so you squeeze every ounce of energy out.  It's valuable for the mind, too, as it keeps your mind from wandering and forces you to pay attention to what you're doing because if you stop thinking about strategy or recognizing patterns the other fighter is showing, again, you get hit.  And it begins to be the most relaxing thing you do, when you go into a room where there is no computer, no cell phone, no distraction, just what you're doing <i>now</i>.  (It's also surprising how much strategy goes into hitting people; it broadens the mind.)<p>I've found that increasing the demands I make on my body causes me to naturally eat better.  Your body makes demands; for example a lack of iron may cause you to crave beef.  Training made me start drinking more water and less coffee, and fast food started to actually taste <i>bad</i>.

So when you say ""Computer Science majors earn x."" it actually means ""People who do the same jobs that computer science majors tend to do earn x.""<p>If that's the case then the data is not really actionable unless we also know the probability of getting a job with and without some degree.<p>For example, if computer science majors all tend to get job A, but having a computer science degree makes you no more likely than people without computer science degrees to get job A, then the value of the computer science degree is 0.<p>Of course having a degree does usually provide some advantage at getting a job, and in some fields it's impossible to get a job without a degree.<p>But still, for this data to be truly meaningful and actionable you must multiply the value of each degree by the amount that the degree aids you in getting a job, which is a hard value to determine.<p>Edit:<p>Here's an example of why this is important.\nLet's compare physical therapy and programming.<p>According to the data, a Doctorate in Physical Therapy has a value of about $1.2 million, while a Bachelors in Computer Science has a value of around $1.5 million.<p>You might conclude that the computer science degree is a better value, especially since it costs less than the doctorate.<p>However, you cannot be a physical therapist without the degree.

So the value of the degree is going to be $1.5m times some percentage less than 100. In order for the C.S. degree to be more valuable than the P.T. degree you'd have to be 80% more likely to get a job than a programmer without a C.S. degree.

We do not target individuals as they are dispensable and replaceable. It is the system and processes which need to be changed.

We work on the belief that citizens who are well-informed of their rights wrt govt services are less likely to indulge in paying a bribe.<p>To this end, on our site we provide Citizen Charters which are documents of service timelines published by the government. Armed with this document, citizens are better enabled to stand up against corruption.

The obsession will center on how this is yet more proof of the inevitable decline and dumbening of the US and how important it is for high school graduates to apply anyhow. And it will all be wrong, because a return to some cold, hard cost/benefit and affordability analysis is not merely what we need, but in fact will be utterly unavoidable, and this will simply be another consequence of that broad (but quiet) trend.<p>I think I'm going out on a limb a bit here, but it's plausible.

I basically want to make something like Dropbox where you can store your files online and they are automatically synced, but instead of storing your files on a third party's servers, store them on your own computers. You would set up the app on all the computers you want to save your files to and then you'd have a RAID-like setup where if one computer (or maybe more) is destroyed, the rest would have backups of the file. It'd work a lot like Bit Torrent.<p>Would you pay for something like this? How much?",1294293726

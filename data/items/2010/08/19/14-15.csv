1617536,comment,1617278,1617278,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"There's a lot of useful advice in that article. Having organised my fair share of meetings, I offer the following related thoughts...<p>GOALS<p>There are only two useful goals for most meetings:<p>1. Make a specific decision.<p>2. Determine the answer to a specific question.<p>If a decision is that something will be done, it should also state who will do it, and any relevant extra details such as a timescale or who else needs to be notified when the action is complete.<p>Before any formal meeting, an agenda should <i>always</i> be circulated, stating the decisions to be made and questions to be answered during the meeting. Agendas should be provided far enough in advance for attendees to organise their contributions, and to identify any agenda points that could be better addressed in a different forum.<p>After any formal meeting, minutes should <i>always</i> be circulated, stating the decisions and answers. Minutes should be available as soon as possible after the meeting, and placed somewhere they will be easy to find later. Sending the minutes for last month's meeting around the day before this month's meeting is about as useful as sending the agenda around after the meeting has started: better than nothing, but not by much.<p>Anything on the agenda that does not have one of the two specific goals above is probably a waste of time. In particular, agendas consisting only of vague topic headings are the kiss of death for meetings.<p>There is little value in holding a meeting to announce answers that are already known or decisions that have already been made. Just send the information to the relevant people to consider in their own time. If you're ever chairing a meeting and feel yourself about to utter the words ""Let's go round the table..."", you are probably about to make a mistake.<p>ATTENDEES<p>The participants in a meeting should be precisely those who are required to make the decisions and determine the answers.<p>There should also be someone to lead the meeting, and someone to take the minutes. These should preferably be separate people, so neither of them is trying to organise the meeting and participate in the discussion at the same time.<p>If a decision or question does not require at least the majority of the participants in the meeting, it should probably be dealt with on another occasion.<p>If a decision or question can be dealt with by a single person on their own authority, see ""holding a meeting to announce answers that are already known or decisions that have already been made"" above.<p>BRIEFINGS<p>Sometimes, it <i>is</i> useful for one person to share some information with a whole group, possibly with some degree of interaction or taking questions afterwards. This is fine, but if there are going to be mostly one-way briefings like this, they should be scheduled, prepared by the briefer, and presented to the group as such.",1282229953

1617520,comment,1616775,1616775,0,0,CountHackulus,,,"Surprisingly, compilers already do much of these optimization, particularly profile directed feedback (basically a static JIT), and the mixing of high-level and low-level optimizations.<p>Now while, LLVM may not do this, it's far from the only compiler on the block; especially in the non-open-source world.<p>The IR argument is a non-argument. Certain optimizations work better with certain IRs than others, that's just the way it is. It's unlikely that there will be one to rule them all. More likely, we'll convert between them to use the optimal one.<p>Superoptimizers are an interesting case, it's kind of like having a database of optimality. While it may not give much speedup compared to time invested, if you're desperate for that last little bit of performance, it's a great tool. Plus it should make itself faster over time. Could even locate it in the cloud, such that a compiler send its hottest methods over to a remote machine, and it'll use its massive database of optimality to optimize it as best as possible.<p>Verifiable transformations are great in theory, but it's true, it's extremely hard to implement currently.<p>The author definitely has a point about AOT/JIT compilers being the future of optimization.

1617515,comment,1617022,1617091,0,0,foobob,,,"Historical reasons. Solaris was the definitive platform circa the late nineties. I used Linux back then, but it was definitely not ready for prime time yet. Many enterprises were built around Solaris. Today, Linux is a better alternative today for most use cases, but only marginally better. Until a year ago, it was not worth the cost of a switch.<p>Why a year ago? Oracle bought Sun. Sun was very good at creating open, useful platforms, but was very bad at making money off of them. Sun was bought by Oracle. Oracle isn't very good at building software, but is extremely good at selling it and maximizing profit from it. Oracle needs to make back the 7+ billion dollars it made on Sun somehow. How? We have part of the answer in the Google suit: by milking Sun's customer base.<p>Java has 10 million developers. To make 10 billion (there's a fair bit of risk in buying Sun -- if Oracle wants a 3x return, that's 10 billion each for Java, hardware, and Solaris), it needs to make $1000 per developer. How? I don't know how, but I'll run one possible scenario.<p>Step 1: Cut off competing JVM implementations with patent and copyright suits. This is already starting to happen.<p>Step 2: Release new versions of Java in two versions. The first is a free Java Express, which is okay for student use, but has no JVM, and omits many of the more enterprise-centric libraries. The second is a full-fledged version, and costs $1000 a pop. Developers would, of course, free to use the old, bit rotting version as well.<p>Most Java developers cannot switch platforms -- most are working on enterprise systems with hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars of sunk costs. Java immediately becomes a legacy platform, but even if only 50% of developers buy into it (even if only during the transition period), Oracle makes a cool $5 billion, almost paying for the rest of Sun.<p>Where does this leave Solaris? I don't know, but I suspect similar things are afoot. Oracle will want to make more money, and Oracle's customers will end up paying more. Oracle is already beginning to move in this direction with the death of OpenSolaris.<p>Aside from that, Oracle is incapable of attracting good\ndevelopers. Former Sun employees are leaving as quickly as they can find new jobs. Will Solaris continue to have a technological advantage in the long term without Sun's brainpower? I seriously doubt it.<p>I know this is a lot of FUD, but with good reason. I am afraid, uncertain, and doubtful about the future of Java and Solaris. While I'm certain that Oracle will continue to develop Solaris so long as it continues to make them money, I don't know what they'll charge for it, or how well they'll develop it. I really wouldn't want to base my business around it.<p>(A secondary, technological answer is that Solaris advantages are much better suited to the climate of the nineties than of the teens. In the nineties, we tend to rely more on big computers with many CPUs, massive amount of memory, and many hard drives. In the teens, the trend is much more towards big arrays of cheap, unreliable, redundant boxes. Solaris' advantages are much more pronounced for the former than the latter.)",1282229642

7520624,comment,7519930,7519930,36,0,keithwarren,,,"It seems the comments area here is full of lots of questions and few answers. Let me try to clear some things up.<p><i>Lets start with how it currently works...</i><p>When you create an application or website in C#,F#,VB.NET or any other .NET language you are not really &#x27;compiling&#x27; it per se to native code, you are compiling it to an intermediate language called IL - very much like Java byte code. When your application or website is run for the first time the .NET runtime converts this code to native code on the local computer and then caches this binary and officially compiled native version of your code. The result is, the first time you run your app or a section of the code there is a small performance hit while the .NET runtime converts your code to native. Let me be perfectly clear, this is a one time thing - a first time thing. Once you have gotten past that every subsequent run is going to be as fast as other native code. (Why is it not as fast as something written in c or c++ you may ask - because there are other things the .net runtime is providing for you like garbage collection, but that is a whole other talk)<p><i>So how is this different?</i><p>This preview allows you to skip this JIT process and image caching process altogether. This is first targeted for Windows store apps, when you would first run it on your machine it was slow on first launch because all this extra work was being done. Microsoft decided they could take the server side resources they had and run this JIT and imaging process ahead of time and when someone downloads and installs your app - this work was already done and first launch would be faster - as much as 60% faster. There are also lots of changes under the hood to make this all work better - Andrew Pardoe is on this comment thread further down and mentioned things like a refactored runtime, static-optimized libraries, static marshalling all combining for performance wins.<p><i>Does this mean I can build apps for Unix with C#</i><p>No, Mono is still the best way to do that<p><i>Can I build simple console apps with this and deploy to machines without the .NET runtime?</i><p>No, right now this is only available for Windows Store apps. Besides, unless you have some Windows 98 machines sitting around nearly every PC has the .NET runtime.<p><i>Will this make my app run faster?</i><p>Starting up, yes. Normal operation, probably not. .NET runtime and jitter have been around a long time and they are impressively efficient and fast. This includes some tweaks to parts of the runtime but don&#x27;t expect to see your text file processing app go from 10 seconds to 2 or something like that.<p><i>Will this help me pick up chicks?</i><p>Depends.",1396493476

This bug, however, is an edge case where TextSecure indicates that it is going to send a message <i>insecurely</i>, and that&#x27;s what it does.<p>It&#x27;s also true that until recently we didn&#x27;t have an encrypted group chat protocol, but at no point in the past did TextSecure ever indicate that group chat was encrypted.

The point of &quot;man marries his maid&quot; is that after the marriage GDP goes down in spite of an increase in economic activity - the maid continues cleaning his house, but also cleans his pipes.<p>Women staying home for family work is a real change in economic activity. Domestic labor may not be properly accounted for, but it&#x27;s not a no-op as with the man marrying his maid.<p>In any case, merely tracking production and ignoring the paper cost of transfers is a fairly valid way of looking at things. I don&#x27;t fully agree with it, because I do consider it a cost when a productive worker loses some of his productive capacity, even if another person gains an equivalent amount.

He wasn&#x27;t wrong. However, as a way to improve code quality, management decided to make the continuous integration server demand 90% test code coverage minimum, including branches, and no loss of code coverage over half a percent from maximum, as measured by Sonar.<p>So I inherited a large, rather terrible application, which included a whole lot of UI code using Swing. Swing has it&#x27;s qualities, but being easy to write meaningful tests for isn&#x27;t one of them. So my predecessors often left some chunks of frontend relatively untested, while making sure large amounts of business logic was well tested. So to keep the application in order, I started doing a bunch of refactoring. I cut the size of the backend in half, and all the tests kept passing. But my commits were rejected by the build.<p>So if you have 10K lines of untested code, and 90K lines of very ugly, badly factored, but tested code, you just couldn&#x27;t remove 10K of the bad, well tested code, because that would sink coverage metrics.<p>After much arguing for relaxing the rules, as I didn&#x27;t think that adding tests after the fact to bad UI code seemed like a good use of our time, I fixed it in the only sensible way I could: Added an extra ten thousand lines of well tested code that didn&#x27;t actually run in production, but made the metrics happy.

Does it let me find some answer more easily than another way? Does it preserve consistency/truth values? Under what conditions?&#x27;</i><p>That&#x27;s far from being dependent solely on their individual whim, the decisions they make in that regard, and the answers they will get, are strongly influenced by the form the system has taken and it&#x27;s uses and limitations.<p>Of course if you want to maintain that maths as a whole is arbitrary because you could make whatever you liked up and say you were doing maths... well, I won&#x27;t argue you&#x27;re not, but it seems to me you&#x27;ve made the objection general enough that it could safely be ignored. Anyone doing something purposeful could simply assert: &#x27;Your&#x27;s, maybe. We&#x27;re trying to do our-maths-goal.&#x27; And move on.",1396490865

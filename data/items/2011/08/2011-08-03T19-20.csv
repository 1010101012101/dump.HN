2842717,comment,2841992,2841992,147,0,scarmig,,,"I'm sorry, but the ignorance expressed in this thread by some is absolutely astounding. Per mile, truckers drive far more safely than the typical driver. Just to put things in immediate perspective.<p>Beyond that, though, some people here are spending a whole lot more time blaming the drivers for the inevitable lapses in safety that occur when you're driving thousands of miles a week. Of course, it's definitely more comfortable to do that than consider the systemic reasons that happens, and your own role in it.<p>Goods have to be transported. The almighty market demands that. Which is to say, you demand it. So various companies have sprung up for centuries to transport those goods. These companies compete to lower costs as much as possible. If they don't, they're driven out of business, because stores know consumers prefer something to be a nickel cheaper even if it's bad for the environment, the truckers, and other nearby drivers. If a price is higher, companies choose to go with the trucking company that offers the cheaper price, because consumers like their nickel.<p>The way we've set up the system incorporates the public safety dangers into the price, via lawsuits etc., and the way we like it is to essentially demand that companies force drivers to drive the hell out of their trucks and their lives. We like our fucking nickels. At least more than any safety concerns.<p>Some here have said ""well if the job is hard, then quit it!"" Wow. Do you think people don't do this? Do you think that changes the market equilibrium at all? It doesn't. Whoever replaces him or her will drive under the same demands and incentives, and will on average respond the same way to those demands and incentives. No benefit.<p>I've seen also some victim blaming in saying ""well if the job is hard, ask for a raise or get a union!"" Interesting story there. Back in the mid-20th century, trucking was one of the most heavily unionized industries, via the IBT primarily. However, in the 80s and 90s, various Republican and Democratic administrations collaborated with trucking companies to make war on the unions. Originally truckers were employed directly by the companies, but eventually those companies realized they could react to unionization by outsourcing truckers, either into private shell companies that closed down as soon as unionization hit or by hiring truckers as contractors. Various NLRB boards aided and abetted this regulatory change.<p>The ruling elite (of which we are all part) largely cheered this on, because those greedy truckers are stupid and uneducated and don't deserve to make as much as us hardworking educated intelligent people, masters of the universe that we are.<p>So, we got our way! And our nickel. Drivers ended up atomized and could not collectively bargain against the buyers of their labor, decently-sized companies who had monopsony power in the trucker marketplace. So everyone ends up driven to the least common denominator.<p>If you want a better system, fight for it. Moreover, vote for it. Otherwise when some trucker nearly drives you off the road because they have to feed their family, you're just getting what you paid for.",1312401046

However, the experimental results did suggest that drivers were more cautious in their merging maneuvers. This was thought to be attributable to the joint merge, which produced a more evenly balanced lane volume at the transition zone entrance.</i><p>That is: drivers were more cautious (good), exit traffic flow was the same (contrary to your statement) and lane volume was balanced - i.e. the traffic jam extended less further down the freeway (very good).<p>Two major reasons for accidents during merges are<p><pre><code>  1) Anger at merge points based on perceived fairness
  2) High speed traffic in the empty lane hitting vehicles

Absolute reeking, fuming, bubbling, flaming, smelly, gooey, sticky, yucky nonsense.<p>So, he received an e-mail message.  Okay, we're talking likely post office protocol 3 (POP 3).<p>Back when I was using OS/2 and had no decent e-mail software, I took out an afternoon and wrote my own POP 3 client e-mail software.  I used it for years.  I'm about to ditch Outlook 2003 and return to what I wrote (in Rexx) on OS/2.<p>Gotta tell you, no way, not a chance, was there any way to infect my computer by sending me e-mail.  Not in this galaxy.  Send me anything you want, pictures, viruses, root-kits, Flash, infected, 'active' PDF files, EXE files, Active-X files, spreadsheets, etc., and no way will my computer be 'infected'.  Just impossible.<p>Why:  First, the data that comes via POP 3 is lines of text of just 8 bit characters.  Period.<p>At the beginning are the 'header lines'.  The end of the header lines is denoted by one blank line.<p>The rest of the e-mail is just the 'body', and it is just more lines of text of 8 bit characters.<p>Harmless.  It's just some simple minded data as lines of 8 bit characters.  Can put the data in an ordinary file, edit it with an ordinary editor, view it on the screen, print it out, etc.  All harmlessly.<p>The body may have a PDF file, a movie, some audio, some Flash, and EXE file, a spreadsheet, etc., and still it's all just harmless data.  Period.<p>If there is one or more 'attachments', then each of these is delimited by a line with some text indicated in the header.  Each such attachment is just more lines of text.  To permit sending any data at all, these lines of text consist of just 65 simple-minded, old ASCII printable characters.  You can print them out, and they won't hurt you, steal your bank records, install software on your computer, etc.  They are 100% harmless.<p>Those 65 characters are part of a scheme called 'base 64 encoding' which is part of the e-mail 'multi-media internet mail extensions' (MIME).<p>For such an attachment. can follow the base 64 rules and 'decode' the attachment back to the original data in the file.  The file, then, will be a sequence of 8 bit bytes.  Give the file any name you want and put it in any directory ('folder') you want.  Yes, you do NOT want to put the file where other software will use that file without your knowledge; but why would you do that?  E.g., don't overwrite some important operating system DLL file.<p>The file may be in the format of an EXE file, JPG file, GIF file, PNG file, XLS file, etc.  Still it is just a file, just a sequence of bytes.  Like any other sequence of bytes, it's harmless, will not cause blindness, falling hair, black toenails, or an infected computer.  You can copy it, back it up, send it as an attachment via e-mail, etc. all harmlessly.<p>The file can be a virus, a root-kit, a Trojan, malicious, malevolent, nasty, etc., but STILL is just 100% harmless, safe, and innocuous.  No rubber gloves needed.<p>Now, if the computer is being used by a total dummy, idiot, drooling on the keyboard, licking the screen, etc., then there might be a threat:  The rube might permit such a file to execute as software on their computer.  Dumb.  Stupid.  Brain-dead.  Don't do that.  Never do that.<p>First rule of computer security:<p><pre><code>     Never, ever permit data from an untrusted
     source to execute as software.
</code></pre>
Never.  Ever.  Don't do that.<p>So, if there was a computer security problem, then it was NOT the e-mail, the attachment, or the spreadsheet but JUST some total idiot who let such an attachment execute as software.<p>Any author of any e-mail program that lets data execute as software without very explicit approval of a user should be dragged through the streets while peasants throw garbage, two week old dead animals, night soil, upchuck, toxic witch's brew, effluent from tanning animal skins, etc., racked, excoriated, eviscerated, drawn, quartered, hung, dried, roasted, and fed to sick animals.",1312400129

2842620,comment,2841992,2842560,5,0,_delirium,,,"I agree that that's probably a good way to mitigate the problem, but the U.S. already does transport a surprisingly large amount of freight by rail, with relatively little fanfare. It's a <i>lot</i> more than Europe, for example, which has much more high-profile passenger trains, but much lower use of freight rail. The last time I looked up statistics, it was about 35% of American freight going by rail, versus about 10% of EU-nation freight. Obviously 35% could go up, but it's not <i>too</i> bad. It just feels like we have fewer trains than we do, because as a human wanting to get places you can't easily take them.<p>A bigger problem might be the geographic distribution of truck vs. rail traffic. Rail traffic dominates in the transcontinental trips, because it's a lot cheaper to ship bulk cargo or shipping containers by rail from LA to Chicago, than by truck. But open-road inter-city trucking from LA to Chicago is relatively safe. Where trucks are most dangerous is within-urban-area transit, in congested metropolitan areas, but those are also the hardest to replace. For example, Safeway alone sends thousands of trucks out daily to supply its grocery stores; much of the produce is moved from ships to a local staging area by rail, but the last 10 miles to the actual store goes by truck. It'll be very difficult to replace that, unless we return to the days of a dense rail network where businesses had their own local rail sidings for deliveries.",1312399771

The docu said the average US truck driver visits the restroom only once in 3-4 days. To prove this assertion, they had a group of East-West truck drivers swallow a tiny camera that transmitted pictures of their colon until it was ejected. It was quite gross, vivid and very conclusive evidence. They then had half the group switch to a diet of canned veggies - peas-in-a-can, carrots-in-a-can etc. The truck drivers ended up visiting the restroom 2-3 times per day, were much lighter physically, and a lot more relaxed, chatty and fun.<p>It was on Discovery I think...if you have a link pls post.",1312399539

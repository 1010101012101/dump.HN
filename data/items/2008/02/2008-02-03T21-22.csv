108780,comment,108723,108723,0,0,hugh,,,"If you want to go to the fundamentals, I'd suggest The Principles of Mathematics by Bertrand Russell. It won't tell you much about the specific sub-branches of mathematics, but it's a good introduction to mathematics the way mathematicians see it, as opposed to mathematics the way high-school students (or teachers, for that matter) see it.<p>To give you an idea of the flavour of it, here's the opening sentence:<p>""Pure Mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form p implies q, where p and q are propositions containing one or more variables, the same in the two propositions, and neither p nor q contains any constants except logical constants.""<p>It's way out of copyright, so there's an online version:<p><a href=""http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathe...</a>",1202075199

I taught myself programming with BASIC when I was a kid, my first programs were horrible, unstructured things with GOTOs everywhere and redundant code and yet I was able to teach myself Scheme as well a few years later.<p>In fact, I find that I understand the point behind useful programming language constructs (and, yes, their beauty) after spending some time suffering due to the lack of them.",1202072781

Things like dominant function, for example, aren&#x27;t going anywhere.<p>That said, I agree with the point that is implied by your post, namely, that &quot;music theory&quot; as the term is usually used is actually a description of a specific period of music (Common Practice) and it is a mistake to view modern popular music as some kind of degenerate case of it. I suggest that people who are interested in learning a theory that applies to more recent music take a look at &quot;What to Listen For in Rock&quot; by theorist Ken Stephenson.\n<a href=""http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300092394"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300092394</a><p>I also don&#x27;t think the link you sent is going to make things much clearer for a beginner.

While many programmers may contribute to any arbitrary project because of their interest or dependence on the software, the most effective way to signal your skill as a developer would be to contribute to software that is either a) used by the prospective employer to support their business, or b) developed by the employer himself (likely to support their business).<p>However, this theory doesn&#x27;t take into account that one may contribute to an OSS project, because an employer is paying them to do this in the first place. Both employers and employees participate in OSS. Employees want to demonstrate their skill so that they would get employed, while employers want to demonstrate their organization&#x27;s engineering talent to attract even more talent. The paper seems to assume that OSS signaling is simplex, whereas it is actually duplex. But beyond signalling, an organization open sourcing software can be seen as a way to encourage standardization of that software (Android, WebKit, V8, and in the future maybe Dart) instead of a competitor&#x27;s potentially closed alternative (which might be more expensive to deploy/port/debug and so on).<p>Sun Microsystems&#x27; open sourcing of Solars and JVM can be seen as an attempt attract more talent to the company (which at that time was fairly unpopular, especially when compared to Google which was an open source darling).",1413578829

Should you lose your private key or it gets compromised you generate a new one and issue new certificates. And naturally also revoke your previous certificates.<p>I disagree. While yes a new key would be ideal, generally while you are dealing with the existing problem you will want to reach for the old key. I am not talking about situations where you misplaced the key or the server got compromised. I am talking about a situation where your current server/VPS suddenly dies and you need to spin up a new one fast. IMO, in this case wasting time on issuing/re-issuing a cert is inappropriate. On top of this, I tend to generate the certs on my laptop (I trust its RNG and physical security more than I trust the server). The key is already here. Now I can encrypt it with GPG with the full force of my 4096 bit key that only I can decrypt and store it fairly securely this way. I believe this is good enough for personal and professional sites. In the ideal case scenario, I&#x27;d also only keep these on an encrypted flash drive for even greater physical security.",1413577307

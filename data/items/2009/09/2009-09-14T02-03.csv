820999,comment,820939,820939,0,0,NathanKP,,,"City-wide WiFi is usually pitched as making sense in a city in which there are many underprivileged who may not be able to get their own wireless service.  But then again, if someone can buy a laptop to use wireless then why can't they pay for wireless service?  I guess it would be a nice thing to have if the city budget has that much extra to spare.<p>In the meantime you can always skim wireless from numerous unsecured hotspots.

I'm a satisfied tarsnap user but unless you greatly improve the site you won't get others except very early adopters like me.<p>That said, the new site is missing the mark.  There is plenty of good advice here on how to improve the content.  You best bet is to copy some ideas from your competitor's content.  Even if you do that, it will still look like you did the web page and look ugly.  There my be no way around you shelling out a few hundred bucks on a web designer.

The best line you've got is ""online backups for the truly paranoid"".  Put a graphic button somewhere so people can reflexively click on it and get taken to a payment page.<p>- please don't tell us what it DOESN'T do on the front page (i.e. Windows support). My website doesn't make ice cream, but it is irrelevant. Also, you don't want negative sentiment anywhere near your payment process.<p>- Improve the start area.

I've never really understood what the advantage for the government was, unless the assumption was that it would add to the network infrastructure of the city for city use, which is silly, as they wouldn't be able to use it for private communications.<p>As a tax-payer, I can't imagine wanting to pay for something like that either, at least not above what I already pay my wireless carrier.

Furthermore, before World War I, coal was our primary energy source-- less than 20% of our global energy usage came from oil before 1920. To say that the oil industry has had the same drivers as it's changed from being just a source of kerosene to the primary world energy source is inaccurate.<p>Incidentally I do agree that ""presupposing a [sic] impeding [sic] permanent shortfall in global hydrocarbon supplies"" is likely to be a poor idea, but not for the reasons you state.

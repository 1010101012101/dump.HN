For the past ten years we've informed the entire world, including MPEG LA, of our specifications and algorithms in detail. We've requested in open letters that any group believing we are infringing to inform us so that we make take immediate corrective action.<p>I predict that MPEG LA may counter that they know groups have been pressured into licensing patents in order to use Theora.

It wasn't until I read this[1] review article that I understood that.<p>However, you yourself made a few mistakes. Technically, LaTeX is not a formatter, it is a markup language for the TeX typesetting system. In addition, it is actually <i>not</i> an interpreter (in the same way that HTML is not an interpreter).<p>LyX is, as I said, a <i>WYSIWYM</i> editor for LaTeX. It is also allows LaTeX insertion and imports, so it should be arbitrarily flexible, not handicapped.<p><i>Finally: parading your lack of knowledge of classical mythology or modernist literature really doesn't do you any favours.</i><p>Hmm. Actually I have read Ulysses, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Finnegans Wake, as well as the Odyssey. James Joyce is probably one of my picks for greatest authors who ever lived.

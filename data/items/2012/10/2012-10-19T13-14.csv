I don't want calls from the debt collectors trying to reach the person who used to have my number. For me, and people like me, a telco-based solution won't work because they have to adhere to the regulations that have these giant exemptions.<p>In volume, you could make a device for landlines for probably <$50. Connect the device to the primary incoming line. Connect phone(s) to the device.<p>User dials #4321 (some non-secret activation code, printed in instructions and sticker on device) from house phone. Follows prompts to record (a) his name, (b) names of other individuals at the house, (c) one or more bogus names. May also follow prompt to enable a bypass code. May also follow prompts to add CID numbers to whitelist (see below; this is for DESIRABLE robocalls, e.g. from the school district in case of emergency or school cancellation). User hangs up; device is programmed.<p>Incoming call, 2 rings, CID/CNAM captured (FWIW), house phones do not ring. Device answers: ""Calls may be recorded. Press 1 for Bogus John, 2 for Real Alice, 3 for Real Bob, 4 for Bogus Carol"". Caller presses 1/4, ""Please leave a message after the tone"", tone plays, incoming voice goes to /dev/null for 10s, call is dropped. Caller presses 2/3, house phones ring, stored CID/CNAM is provided.<p>If the incoming caller uses the bypass code, the call goes straight through.<p>Bonus: distinctive ring for Alice vs Bob.<p>Bonus: after an annoying human caller ""leaks"" through, user can hang up, pick back up, and dial #5432 [some other non-secret access code]. Incoming CID put on block list. Calls from blocked numbers are unanswered (will go to VM if user subscribes to VM from telco).<p>Bonus: similar to blacklist, user can dial #2222 (for ""whitelist to Alice"") or #3333 (""whitelist to Bob"") to whitelist a just-received call. Whitelisted calls immediately go through. DR means that I don't have to check CID to know it's my MIL calling for wife. Numbers can be whitelisted during programming (see above) because desirable robocalls (e.g. kids' school) will otherwise never get through and can't get #2222 treatment.<p>Bonus: pressing ## (or some other code) during a call starts a recording. Saved as <cid>-<date/time>.wav to removable flash or USB on the device.<p>Bonus: insert flash/USB, dial #9876 from house phone. Device upgrades itself from the flash.",1350655040

4673493,comment,4671530,4672389,3,0,chubbard,,,"I was going to retort to your statement about changing failure rates saying that's not side of the equation we're talking about.  If we take this as the number of startups we create as:<p><pre><code>   numberOfSuccessfulStartups = startupAttempts * successRate
</code></pre>
Then Jon Stewarts observation is by lowering risk failure we raise the startupAttempts.  Not only do we raise the attempts, but we can recycle the failures to drive startupAttempts up more resulting in a higher number of successful startups is his hypothesis.  Adding health benefits, tax credits for loses, etc drive up startupAttempts by lowering risk.<p>However, your observation that making things cushy for entrepreneurs could lower successRate because you don't have to hustle as much.  Sort of a if I fire this gun above your head while you work maybe you'll work harder argument.  I say that in some jest because I think there is some merit to your observation just how much I don't think either of us know.<p>The one counter I can provide to your counter is that lowering risk might have the same effect as lowering incentives for results.  Basically support from this work on how incentives can lower success if they are too high.  What I'm saying is maybe if risk is too high fewer people attempt and even fewer people succeed because there aren't enough original ideas to copy for scale.<p><a href=""http://carmine.se.edu/cvonbergen/Incentives.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carmine.se.edu/cvonbergen/Incentives.pdf</a><p>(Couldn't find a better link.)<p>I think both hypothesis have their points and we need more data to support them.",1350654786

* Transaction emails with links back to the site (""this week on example.com"", ""joe just mentioned you..."" password resets, etc.)
* Links in Atom, RSS feeds, etc.<p>In each case, Django could require that hosts be hardcoded (perhaps in settings) instead of consulting requests, but that would make each of those things harder to use.<p>... I'm not really trying to have an argument here; I see your point completely and I think I probably agree, personally.

I'll happily pay for anything available through legal channels, for a fair price, without inane restrictions, in a format that suits my purposes. Anything else, I will pirate, since I wouldn't ever pay money for it anyway.<p>An unreleased version of Mac OS X clearly falls in the first category. OS X has always been distributed without crazy DRM schemes, for a fair price, and without any hidden gotcha's that cripple it's utility. I would never pirate it.<p>For music, I've switched from downloading everything to paying for Spotify. I have no need for cabinets full of shiny silver discs, and I don't feel like paying for crappy songs I don't like just because they happen to be on the same album as the one or two songs I was looking for. Spotify fits the bill for me, so I don't have to pirate anymore.<p>For movies, it's a whole different story. I don't have a Blu-Ray player (I have a PS3 but it sucks for watching video because of the noise), so buying discs to see high-def movies is out. Nine times out of ten, the movies I like are not your typical Hollywood blockbuster crap, so I can't even get them on Blu-Ray anyway. I built my own HTPC running XBMC because it's a million times better than any device I can buy in a store, which means I prefer to have my movies in a common, unprotected video format. No legal alternative exists that provides those, so I download each and every movie I want to see.<p>The day a commercial service is available that has not just Hollywood blockbusters but also foreign/ arthouse/ classic or niche movies, and allows me to play them on my own device, for less than $10 a movie (or e.g. $30 a month for all you can eat), I'll sign up immediately.<p>Some might say I have no entitlement to make any demands as to the way the content I want to consume is distributed or how much I have to pay for it. This is actually a fair point, but the producers have no entitlement to get my money either. Because I try to be fair to producers and artists by legally buying content when it is available under such terms I can justify paying for it, I don't feel bad about pirating everything else at all. It's not even illegal where I'm from anyway (at least not for music and video, software I stopped pirating long ago).",1350653488

It's just crazy enough it might just work!<p>I've always felt that America's psyche is evolving us to a ""Everybody's a CEO."" mentality.  With the introduction of 401K we upped the risk taking, driving white collar workers into consulting away from full time employment with benefits of incorporating, tax benefits of corporations, preferential tax treatment of capital gains vs salaries.  These are all incentives to create your own corporation over being a salaried employee, but they all involve taking more risk.  We are rewarding risk more and more while devaluing safety.  Not passing judgement per se, but making an observation that America might be interested in this if they understood it.  And that America might need this anyway because we are pushing more people into accepting the risk without their choice.  (see 401K as an example).<p>Another side benefit to this is it might drive up competition for workers because more people might be interested in working for smaller companies because benefits are more equalized.  Driving competition for workers means higher salaries too on a whole as they compete for the talent.  That's the real societal benefit.<p>Now, if I could just figure out a way to pay myself entirely in dividends over a salary I think they might give me an honorary 1%'er membership. :-)<p>But on the other hand.

4673377,comment,4672380,4672763,20,0,crntaylor,,,"I don't think you can refer to function composition as a design pattern. The syntax for function composition in Haskell is so light that most of the time it's <i>more</i> effort to write in all the arguments explicitly than it is to use composition. Consider<p><pre><code>    lineLengths = map (length . words) . lines
</code></pre>
as compared to<p><pre><code>    lineLengths text = map length (map words (lines text))
</code></pre>
I don't think that monads are a design pattern either (in this I agree with Tony Morris [1]). Monads are a unified method of doing contextual computations. They are far too general to be a design pattern in themselves (how many design patterns do you know that encompass failure, error handling, nondeterminism, probabilistic computation, logging, backtracking search, mutable state, asynchronous computation, continuations, I/O...)<p>Monads should be more accurately thought of as an <i>interface</i> that is implemented by many types (in Haskell terminology, a class that many types are instances of).<p>I am not saying that there aren't any design patterns in Haskell - just that function composition and monads are <i>not</i> examples of design patterns. Instead, common design patterns include<p>* Writing tail-recursive, accumulating helper functions where you'd use a for loop in an imperative language:<p><pre><code>    sum xs = go 0 xs
      where
        go result []     = result
        go result (x:xs) = go (result + x) xs
</code></pre>
* Using strict left folds to accumulate values<p><pre><code>    sum = foldl' (+) 0
</code></pre>
* Using runStateT and its cousins to tame stateful computations<p><pre><code>    sum xs = execStateT (go xs) 0
      where
        go []     = return ()
        go (x:xs) = modify (+x) >> go xs
</code></pre>
* Using a record of functions to encapsulate related functions that might be given different implementations (like a lightweight version of classes)<p><pre><code>    data Lens a b = Lens { get :: a -> b, set :: a -> b -> a }
</code></pre>
* Using libraries like Conduit or Pipes to structure your program as a flow of data through componentized parts.<p>Then there are 'large scale' design patterns, like<p>* Structuring your code in three parts: (i) data type declarations, (ii) pure functions operating on the data, (iii) a thin I/O wrapper to glue the pure functions together.<p>* Using the MonadIO, MonadState, MonadWriter etc classes to keep your code implementation agnostic.<p>To re-iterate: I agree with you that functional languages (like Haskell) still have design patterns. But I don't think that monads or function composition are good examples of functional design patterns.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.tmorris.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.tmorris.net/</a>",1350652699

It's written by Juriy Zaytsev who was a maintainer for prototype.js. I find the code useful for learning advanced object oriented JavaScript because:<p>1) It's self contained. No dependencies on third party OO libraries or frameworks.<p>2) The code is very readable.<p>3) It's a canvas library, so it's fun to work with if you're into graphics and visualizations.<p>4) You'll learn a lot about how many JS projects are built, documented, and tested, if you get it to build and the tests running on node.js.<p>Here is what I would do:<p>1) Check out the project and get it building.<p>2) Read all the files in the util folder. You'll see a lot of methods added to Object and Array.<p>3) Take a look at lang_class.js: <a href=""https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/blob/master/src/util/lang_class.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/blob/master/src/util/lan...</a> This is how he does OO JS.

As I understand it app's now download retina resources whether you have a retina iPad or not.<p>It's always done that (ever since the release of the original iPad and the creation of ""hybrid"" iPhone/iPad applications), the version of iOS you're running is completely irrelevant to that issue: if you're running an application compatible with all iOS devices (3GS to iPad 3 at native resolutions) it may very well bundle 4 different copies of bitmapped assets (or even 5 for e.g. startup screens, since the iPhone 5 has a different resolution than the 4/4S). I don't believe iOS AppStore bundles have every been stripped. I'm not even sure they could be since they're signed (unless you jailbreak).",1350651942

It merely requires moderators to decide and agree to do it that way.<p>> There are other ways to punish and train bad behavior from legitimate contributors.<p>Yes. Problem is that while it does punish (in some sense), in no sense does it ""train"" the affected users, because there's no telling when/if they will <i>notice</i>  the punishment, it could be many <i>months</i>, and even if by then the user takes the trouble to figure out what post caused this sanction, the complete lack in <i>immediacy</i> of consequence entirely negates any effectiveness in behavioural change (see: Operant Conditioning, there's a lot of research that is directly applicable to online community moderation).",1350651677

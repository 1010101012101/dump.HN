113296,comment,113122,113201,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Tipjoy is actually just the first user of a system I'm calling Millipaid. It will be a completely customizable micropayments solution. Before then, we'll release Tipjoy Platform. The site owners get a cut, and the content creators get a cut. It will be up to the platform to decide the distribution. Video sites could really benefit from it. So could sites like thesixetyone, twitter, etc.",1202723676

113294,comment,113122,113180,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Lots of blogs are really good at finding the best things on the internet, and delivering them to readers. The content creators clearly should get most of any tips, but the ""finders fee"" is also an important part.<p>We intend on building this. The challenge will be making it clear that the button goes in part to both people. We really don't want to make users think too much about tipping.",1202723399

It will allow you to create your own micropayments engine, and determine the distribution model of your content.  Internationalization is also on the roadmap. Maybe we'll tip users who help out :)",1202722807

They've both gotten a bunch of tips, but only one is available on techcrunch.com. It's actually an interesting accidental experiment to see the tipping rates.",1202722580
113289,comment,113244,113244,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Some people, noob or not, have a <i>style</i>. Some code has a style. Some programs are best expressed as narrative little stories and documenting them as such makes sense. This is often true when the program's data flow is very linear.<p>Some programs benefit greatly by having dense little blocks, with nothing more than a two work reminder as to what they do, that can be considered carefully and held tightly in the mind. Any program that has atomic/blocking operations or concurrency seems to fit this model.<p>To say that ""noobs use a lot of this kind of comment"" and ""mature programmers use this different style"" may be partly true but seems very much overly simplistic.",1202722342

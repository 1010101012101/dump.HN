My understanding is that there has been increasing cooling in the last decade, with the coolest year this past year.  Where exactly is the warming?

392660,comment,389401,391163,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"I guess it just seems much more elegant and simple to me to have only one kind of scope in the language.  One is all you need.<p><i>No, closures refer to the j variable that doesn't get incremented, only assigned to.</i><p>""Doesn't get incremented, only assigned to.""  I don't know what that means.  How is ""i++;j=i;"" any different, really, than ""i++;j++""?<p><i>The assignment is by value - no vars get ""passed by reference"", whatever this means.</i><p>""Passed by reference"" ==> all the closures reference the same ""j"" variable.  The phrase ""pass by reference"" is, of course, a bit of a mixed metaphor, since it's not really ""passed"" as an argument to a function, but rather trapped by a closure.  Same difference.<p><i>The actual issue is that all invocations of the loop body alias the same var j, even though it's declared inside the block.</i><p>""Even though""?  There <i>are</i> no blocks in javascript; only functions create scope.  That's what's so awesomely simple about this language.  Eh, to each his own, I guess.<p>Lexical scope <i>could</i> be introduced in the new additions to ES3.1, but I'm pretty sure it won't be.  A javascript engine would be crazy to try to shoehorn it into the language now, since it would, in fact, break a lot of code in the wild.<p>Time to man up. :)<p><i>Modern Scheme compilers are quite clever at eliminating unneeded activation frames and closures, sometimes even converting closures into inline code.</i><p>Isn't that roughly what tracemonkey does?",1228898697
392659,comment,392460,392628,0,0,netcan,,,"I agree that these are straw man arguments. I also reacted to them at first. But then he doesn't seem to rely on them too much. He admits that they are a metaphor. 
To be really convinced I would have liked to see him address issues like the likely major food shortage (technology will probably not solve this) & the likely major regional problems caused by mass migrations and/or wars over resources. However, his general argument is that a lot of money is being spent stupidly, very stupidly. I think that he is correct & that he makes that point.<p>I am still hesitant to take his side on this. I have some major problems with this approach:<p>(1) World Government - At the best of times governments are inefficient. For normal maintenance issues like how to run infrastructure, hospital systems, school systems & such they make mistakes, but they get by. Once issues become election winning issues, the debate gets really dumb. this is not only a central focus issue, it is a very technical issue. As he suggests, this is complicated & technical & every action needs to be weighed up. It's inefficient to simply take an ideological stance (renewable energy, energy efficiency, hybrid cars, etc) & get behind anything that promotes it. It is exponentially more rational to make this decision like an accountant creating a cash flow strategy.<p>Unfortunately, it is impossible for a political process such as this to take on an accountant like decision making process. Political debates need to be much more dumbed down to be possible. In this case, this process can be seen as being conducted by the 'Government of the World,' a body very weak in the existence department, never mind the efficiency department. So in a real sense, if a policy can't be chanted by a mob, it cannot be pursued. Certainly not over the 50+ year period necessary. I just don't think that his 'plan' is a possibility. The political structure & decision making process here is our tool. We have a wood. He is proposing building a house from bricks.<p>(2) Maybe panic is Necessary - Many predict that there is indeed a need for panic. That is possibly because of point of no return due to feedback. There are two kinds of feedback: the physical kind such as methane releases from melting permafrost, the political kind due to climate related political consequences such as a Chinese famine or a Pakistan/India war related to river flows.<p>(3) Economic models break down at these sorts of concepts. Comparing economic outputs between two scenarios where one of them includes mass starvation is apples to oranges.",1228898609

It wasn't the ONLY factor (the search engine was pretty good too ;)), but I think displaying results faster (smaller page size, more focused UI), contributes positively to the experience.<p>Perhaps there are UIs that would have resulted in faster growth or more total marketshare, but there are definitely UIs that would have made things far worse.

To a person who does not see how any version of the Bible could be the inerrant word of God, it seems eminently possible that the units of time that have been translated as years could well actually be units of time that are much longer than years.<p>But as we both say, this would of course mean that one would have to be open to the possibility that a text originally based on oral history, which has been translated into and out of who knows how many languages, subject to all manner of surreptitious political motivations in the process, over the course of thousands of years, may be subject to some inaccuracies.",1228898261

392646,comment,391515,392582,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"No, how did you infer that from what I wrote? A dynamic type system, as you pointed out, may be better at enforcing restrictions than a static one. The notion of 'strength' that I was talking about is separate from the enforcement mechanism.<p>Some questions that pop into my mind when i consider type systems are:<p>1) What are the criteria that a datum must fulfill in order to be considered of type Foo? 
2) How is this to be determined?
3) Why would I ever need to know this?<p>1 & 3 impact the strong-weak continuum, number 2 does not.  The less that type impacts allowed (at run or compile time) operations (#3), the weaker the type system.  Note that you often can implement the manipulation of metadata in your language if your language does not already provide these features.<p>As for #1, the more stringent the criteria, the more 'strong' the given language's type system.  A very weakly typed language may have no mechanism of checking for type (in such a language, the type system may only be used internally to the object for things like method resolution.)  The criterion for being of a particular type may be 1) the datum supports all operations defined for a particular type 2) the datum supports all operations defined for a particular type that are used in the current execution scope 3) the datam has the name of the type in a list of types that it claims to be 4) the datum is at least as large as the size of the given type .. and many more ..<p>In the context of re-factoring, the less frequently type is checked and the less rigorous the criteria when it is checked, the more opportunity for type substitution (and thus more flexibility) we have.",1228897424

392638,comment,392368,392368,0,0,Herring,,,"reposting a comment I saw elsewhere, google it for more<p>--<p>Let me, as a chess player, say that I was much less surprised by the resistance the World put up against Kasparov:<p>A) Kasparov is indeed considered the greatest player by most and the reason for his strength when playing ‘over the board’ (OTB, as it is termed) was threefold: 1) he prepared more and better than anyone else 2) his calculating powers OTB were quite magnificent and 3) his understanding of dynamic chess was ahead of his time. Now when using the format of the Kasparov vs the World game these advantages largely (not completely) disappear: 1) everyone can consult books (in particular about openings), 2) everyone can move the pieces around on the board instead of inside their heads 3) the game was not a messy game Kasparov used to excel in but quickly went into a middle game with endgame features.<p>B) Kasparov may be “much better” than other GMs and than Krush in particular, but this difference in strength should be qualified. The difference between me and most tournament players in the US player is much larger than that between Kasparov and Krush! The median rating of US chess players [those who play tournaments and actually do have an official rating] is somewhere around 1000-1100, mine is more than 1100 points higher. Kasparov is “only” about 300-400 points above Krush (and like 150 points above Khalifman).<p>C) There is a good comparison with correspondence chess here: this is where people play by email, for instance, (it used to be by snail mail). I just started playing this myself and the tempo in most games is about 1 move per day. Now I play several people whose OTB ratings are way below mine, indeed a 1000 points below mine. But I don’t have an easy time beating those players in correspondence chess. A difference of 1000 points implies I can beat them, when playing OTB, literally blindfolded (just seeing the board in my head). But in correspondence chess it’s much much harder. They can use opening books and look up how grandmasters have played in the position we happen to have on the board.",1228896347

Venture capital is also a negative sum game (EDIT: I'm actually not sure about this, the winnings of top VCs might outweigh the losses of the majority).<p>Risk hungry people will pay a premium for increased upside.  For example, they will prefer a win 20-lose 30 game over a win 10-lose 0, because 20 > 10.",1210881550

I wrote a thesis on overconfidence for my master in behavioral economics, and the two are related. SSB is a well-documented bias. For instance, 90% of American drivers think they are in the top 50%. It's hard for people to fully appreciate this fact. Allow me to illustrate. Do you still consider yourself, even after reading this statistic, to be in the bottom 50% of drivers? If so, then you're a minority, my friend ;-) (10%, to be exact)",1210881522

It's tempting to believe that prodigies burn themselves out because they get cynical about the ""rat race"", but many burn themselves out by trying to revolutionize the world at a young age, without realizing that the world is a damned hard place to revolutionize. (You can see this phenomenon in the kid in the cited article -- he's ten, and already convinced that he's going to revolutionize a branch of astrophysics.  That's a dangerous kind of immodesty.)<p>Obviously, it's good to strive for creativity and novelty in your work, but you also have to maintain a sense of perspective:  if you've set your goals so high that your definition of ""achievement"" is isomorphic to ""originality"", then you're probably in for a lifetime of disappointment.  It's a hard problem to be original -- there are a lot of other people in the world, and most of them are trying to be original, too.  In fact, being original is a lot like being famous, because you can strive for it, but your success is largely determined by what other people do;  it's probably bad to condition your self-esteem on the actions of other people.<p>For what it's worth, here's my half-formed philosophy:  you have to do whatever it is that gives you a sense of personal satisfaction and contentment.  Your accomplishments don't have to be great; they don't have to be original; they don't have to make you famous.

I don't think that should be your primary consideration. The primary consideration should be the quality of introductory material in that language. I think you'll find most material to be in Java, followed by C++ and Python.<p>Assuming you want to do web programming, I would suggest you start with Python as your first language. It has quality introductory material[1] and is widely used for web programming, as well as many other tasks. There is less complicated syntax that you have to ignore while learning how to program compared to Java and C++, and is generally regarded as a Better Language. Even if you weren't planning on doing web programming, Python would still be my suggestion for a first language. I'd only suggest anything different if your main concern was getting a generic programming job, in which case Java would be a better idea.<p>I feel like JavaScript would be a particularly poor choice as a first language since most introductory JavaScript material isn't trying to teach how to <i>program</i>; it typically teaches how to manipulate web pages. As a new programmer yourself, it will be harder to judge what texts you should pick from those that are available.<p>If you start out trying to learn how to program web applications instead of learning how to program in general, you'll be selling yourself short. Your code will be worse and it will be more difficult to figure out how to solve atypical problems that a web framework hasn't solved for you. Don't do it.<p>[1] Or so I hear.

I can't stress enough the difference between grasping a concept and actually being able to apply it in the field.<p>Second, after you learn your first language, don't ever think of sticking only to it. Learn your second, learn your third and your Nth language and never stop learning them. Sure, most of them are similar (python is like ruby, perl, lisp, c is like c++,c#,java) but there are some oddballs like prolog and haskell which will make you a better programmer just by knowing that they exist and what they're about). Thus you'll have a tool for every job.<p>Also, after a while, learn assembler (x86) and some hardware theory (how a computer works, what's in a CPU or a GPU etc.).<p>Finnaly, have fun! Don't feel pressured to know anything you don't need or don't think will make you a better programmer.  Don't learn Java and it's assorted libraries because every job wants you to know it. Don't learn LISP because the cool kids are doing it, and don't write programs you won't use.",1210878610

I think that was a result of just having a lot more time in the day.<p>The first few days I only slept about 1-3 hours per night. I would lie in bed for 30 minutes then get really bored and so I'd read, work, or clean our apartment. Since I had 20 hours a day, I never felt pressed for time and was pretty relaxed. It's pretty cool to have time to do laundry, clean, run errands, spend hours hanging out, read a book or two, exercise, and work all in one day.<p>I remember being scared the first night when for over 40 hours not only had I not slept, i wasn't even tired.<p>However, over time the effects wore off and I returned to sleeping 6 hours or so a night. Still less than normal, but at that point the (risk of) side effects outweighed the extra two hours of time per day.",1210878433

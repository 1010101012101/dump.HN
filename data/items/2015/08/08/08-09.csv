It won&#x27;t go away, but mobile platforms are where the revenue and activity is.<p>Re: &quot;WinPhone sales catch up with IOS&quot;  - That battle is over.  It&#x27;s not even up for debate.  There was a reason why Nadella has terminated the Windows &quot;Services and Devices Business.&quot; and fired most of the Windows Phone engineers - and that&#x27;s because Microsoft has been thoroughly and completed defeated by Android and iPhone.<p>There are going to be lots of places where Windows Phone will still be used, and, in fact, even be a popular choice.  But there are also places in the world where Blackberry Phones are still used.  But in all the key (and profit generating markets) - Android and Apple have carried the day handily.<p>By the way - I&#x27;m not saying the Microsoft isn&#x27;t dangerous - they are wicked smart, have tons of cash, and have demonstrated that they are willing to make a significant adjustment to strategy &quot;Devices and Services&quot; to &quot;Mobile first, Cloud First&quot; and fire their CEO to do so.<p>What I am saying is that Microsoft is no longer in a position to &quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish.&quot; as Microsoft no longer has the market power to extend important standards and have others adopt those extensions as people are increasingly less likely to be using one of their products, and, more importantly, are increasingly no longer <i>required</i> to use one of their products to get their job done.<p>To bring this conversation back to the beginning Microsoft has released a translation/recompilation layer that will let people who have written applications for iOS, quickly recompile them and release them for Windows, without having to write much, if any, new code.   The objective is to have people write apps for Windows 10 and iOS using this mechanism, because currently, effectively 0% of people are writing first class apps for windows phone (there are, as always, small exceptions, but windows phone basically gets the dregs).<p>The problem with this strategy, is that now Microsoft is playing on <i>Apples</i> platform - and this <i>further reduces</i> the incentive for people to write native Windows phone Apps.  Effectively, this is Microsoft giving up and saying, &quot;If you won&#x27;t write apps for our platform, as least we can emulate other ones and run those apps.&quot;",1439024057

It often gets used to argue &quot;institutions have the moral right to block people if they have unpopular opinions&quot;, which goes against the spirit of free speech (even if it&#x27;s not illegal). I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s it&#x27;s original intent - it might just mean &quot;You can&#x27;t claim you have a constitutional right to swear at people on my forum&quot;.<p>A public forum (which GitLab isn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s a place for code more than politics) that doesn&#x27;t allow civil discussion of on-topic ideas is arguably a bad thing.<p>From On Liberty, by JS Mill:<p>> If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind. Were an opinion a personal possession of no value except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many. But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. <i>If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.</i><p>Of course, Mill assumed that most people are capable of rational thought, and would generally move towards a more correct view of the world when exposed to a marketplace of ideas. The internet doesn&#x27;t always work like that. However, the alternative to &quot;free speech&quot; is echo chambers, which is probably worse.<p>But I don&#x27;t see why GitLab has any real responsibility to allow stuff that&#x27;s not code (or is just joke code) -  it&#x27;s not a really a marketplace of ideas, it&#x27;s a place to share code.

When I initially looked at it in ~2012 I was put off for similar reasons:<p>1. References to pokemon on main pages\n2. Confusing names for features\n3. Written in PHP (this was an initial bias from my prior experience with the language and belief that such a language wouldn&#x27;t be used to maintain a large-scale application).<p>These three points led me to believe that Phabricator was not a first-party application but just PHP glue tying together other open source applications. With this in mind, along with the pokemon, I wrote it off as some highschool/college project and turned my attention elsewhere.<p>I took a fresh look at it in 2014 and realized several of these misconceptions. The developers of Phab tend to be light-hearted and embrace some humor in development. This has proven to be valuable in sustaining good-natured development teams and keeping code-criticisms well-intentioned. They also have a &quot;serious&quot; setting which tones down some of the language in the application itself.<p>The feature names can be confusing, which is a valid criticism though after a week or so it doesn&#x27;t tend to interfere with work. The most difficulty in adopting Phabricator has been getting developers to understand the different development workflow to utilize the code review. Our team sizes range from ~3 to ~8 and haven&#x27;t had any major problems.<p>They have an IRC channel which is usually pretty active, and I&#x27;m sure any questions or concerns you have can be brought up there.<p>We&#x27;ve been using it since ~Febuary 2015 and it&#x27;s been a terrific addition to our development.",1439022763

It&#x27;s a port of BusyBox to WIN32, with random code borrowed from GNUlib for stuff that Microsoft omitted.<p>I maintain the most active fork and got into using it when I ported my last employer&#x27;s software to Windows.  This was originally developed in the early 1990s to run on Unix workstations. For portability it used Bourne shell (not bash) and nawk (not gawk).  BusyBox allowed them to bundle a single executable with the Windows version that was adequate to run those scripts.<p>Some projects use busybox-w32 to allow a Unix-centric build system to work on Windows.  Julia, for example, seems to use it just to get echo and printf.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rmyorston/busybox-w32"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rmyorston/busybox-w32</a>",1439021890

This is all across the board. E.g. 20 years ago every desktop PC needed a graphics card, or at least a graphics chip. But now the vast majority of video needs are satisfied by Intel&#x27;s on-die graphics. Same with USB, it&#x27;s in the Intel chipset. No need for SATA cards or chips, it&#x27;s all in the Intel chipset. So is ethernet. Etc.<p>Plus in the old days hobbyists had a chance of being able to work with DIP components, or even SOICs. Nowadays the resistors and capacitors are almost too small to see without a stereo microscope. And BGA components can&#x27;t easily be soldered or reworked without sophisticated equipment.<p>With more stuff being designed, debugged, and manufactured in Asia, I&#x27;m not surprised that Fry&#x27;s has a lot of older test equipment collecting dust. No demand for it anymore.<p>We live in interesting times. Sucks for people who used to make a good living in electronics.",1439021591

Put hard limits on how much resources any font script can use. There&#x27;s probably a paper out there on how to virtualise just one part of your program - in this case the font rendering functions.

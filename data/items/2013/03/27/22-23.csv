5452493,comment,5451202,5452337,7,0,pnathan,,,"Basically, I would say that what you are suffering from is a kind of mental block syndrome: you think in a procedural/imperative paradigm. All your listed languages operate in that paradigm. It's a very transferable paradigm, as it so happens. I can come up to (some approximation of) speed in an imperative language in under 2 weeks. In order to ship Lisp(Prolog, Haskell...), you <i>have</i> to break out of that paradigm. I am not condemning you, mind. It is what it is. Rewiring your head is hard, and often doesn't have direct results.<p>I can, however, ship with Common Lisp, because I've spent on the order of 5 years learning it and writing it most evenings. I am learning Clojure and am preparing to ship a (excruciatingly minor) product with that after only maybe two months of dabbling. This is possible because I've bent my head around into Lisp shapes.<p>It's also been said that some people have the shape of Lisp in their head, and when they learn Lisp, their heads fit it by nature, and other people don't have that innate meshing.  I certainly found Lisp to mesh with my head well.<p>Oh yes. It can be hard to get started with Common Lisp, just in terms of getting an environment working.

But there is a cost to including articles beyond the storage cost. Articles need to be patrolled for vandalism, and fact checked based on material published elsewhere. If you let people just post anything they want, then people will start using it for spam, fluff pieces, random bullshit, and so on. Enough of that, and it will substantially tarnish Wikipedia's reputation as a useful and unbiased source of information.<p>If a person or organization has never received press coverage, academic research, or other substantial information published on them outside of Wikipedia, why should they have a Wikipedia page?<p>Should every Joe Blow who happened to be captain of the swim team in high school and who's now the local Rotary Club president have a Wikipedia page? Should every mom and pop pizza joint? Who gets to have the Wikipedia page for ""Village Pizza""?<p>The only reason for these small, not otherwise notable organizations to have a Wikipedia page is to increase their perceived notability; having a Wikipedia page indicates a certain amount of fame or notoriety. So in that case, allowing not otherwise notable organizations to have Wikipedia page would basically be a way for them to get free advertising. Especially in a case like this, when the whole page was edited by people who are, apparently, closely connected to the organization in question, and who would fight any negative information placed on the page.",1364424721

Some things called 'best practices' will provide no organisational benefit, and might increase the cost without any corresponding gain.<p>Slogans like 'take pride or fuck it' probably do more harm than good - what you should do is think rationally about what the appropriate quality criteria are for a given project, keeping focused on the continuing 'business' justification for the project and all the criteria, and aim to produce something that lives up to those quality criteria.

In this particular case when you find a topic, or a set of topics, that you can't seriously discuss (even if you both disagree!) with a person because they immediately become offended, you've found a barrier to forming a deeper relationship that is in essence just the same barrier that's formed in any situation when one party stops listening. I'll agree they still may be worth your time due to their ranking on other dimensions, but there will continue to be at least that one barrier. Perhaps over time that barrier might even break down--I really believe the purpose of argument isn't to convince the other person right away, but to plant the seeds of differing thought for them to think about when they reflect on their own beliefs later. (Which brings me to a problem with people who don't seem to reflect on their state of mind and their world view very often, but that's another issue, and in any case such an observation can be hard to measure from the outside so it probably shouldn't be used as a dominant sorting key.)",1364423334

If your muddling around with the internal state of another object there should be alarm bells in your brain triggering you to think ""should i really be doing this?"";  It should look weird.<p>Hiding fields behind method calls obscures what your really doing.  I like that syntax highlighting changing the color on field access and that there aren't parenthesis at the end of the call.  This is what I meant by readability, I instantly know that I'm muddling around with the inner state of another object.  Figuring out whats really going on with getter and setters is made far worse by the common practice of 'overloading' getters and setters to accept / return different types than the internal state representation.<p>3 - I would consider defining field getters in an interface poor form.  There is a reason interfaces (in Java at least) do not allow field definitions.  Defining a 'getter' in an interface is just circumventing that protection and a strong indication the code should be refactored in a different way.",1364423103

Also RWD/AWD is kind of forced upon when you need to transfer a lot of power to the ground - in an FWD layout it turns out to be too complicated and much less effective. That said, as a BMW and thus RWD fan, I must say it doesn't make much sense to produce a RWD in the Mercedes A/B-klasse line, because owners wouldn't gain much or even notice. There was a curious case after the success of BMW 1-series, it turned out in a BMW's poll study that the vast majority of the customers didn't even know it's RWD (which is sad and dangerous) not to mention recognizing the advantages of this layout. The current BMW 1-series platform already supports an FWD layout (to share with Mini) and very probably the next line of 1-series will be FWD, only leaving the coupe (upgraded to 2-series) as RWD.

5452308,comment,5447611,5448541,1,0,Jach,,,"Can you clarify what you think the central assumption in the article is? After typing the rest of this I think I may have misunderstood you. I think the central assumption is stated in the first sentence: ""One oft-underestimated threat to epistemic rationality is getting offended."" I don't think it's much of a leap to generalize that to ""noticing others getting offended is an indicator that their epistemic rationality isn't up to snuff."" But it is inconsistent with a common theme around LW that learning about biases etc. should only be about improving yourself, not about noticing errors in other people. (I say why not both, while just being careful and not over-confident with the latter?)<p>I should clarify that I don't think someone's ""I'm offended"" level <i>completely</i> measures their rationality, it's just a useful indicator. (They may have a Blue v. Green issue that just hasn't come up yet, or they may fail hard in the many other ways humans can be irrational, or my ""this person is offended"" detectors might be screwy.) I agree with the assumption that many, and probably most, seemingly rational people can become quite seemingly irrational when prompted with the right subjects. Or as Tesla put it, ""The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane."" Blue v. Green dynamics, and generally group identification, are pretty embedded in our neurological makeup, and to me only seem connected to ""being offended"" in the way that such a mind state makes it easier to fall into those (and other usually undesirable) modes of thought.<p>I think all bridges can be burnt given enough time, but not all of them through trying to offend alone. With close friends who share your mental structure of finding it hard to be offended, let alone difficult to express it without a trace of irony, it takes other methods to destroy that friendship. The act of incessant trolling by itself could work depending on the person, regardless of if that person finds anything said offensive or not, simply because if I spend all my time trolling them, then <i>I'm</i> not worth <i>their</i> time.<p>I read <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> around the same time as ""A Modest Proposal"", I agree it's still relevant and insightful. I also think you're right about esr's post having a problem by not defining ""racist"", and leaving the reader to do it themselves. (There are many definitions out there.) But I do think people who define ""racist"" as including something similar to ""citing statistics that don't paint a pretty picture of all the various races, where such a pretty picture would show that such a simple observable never correlates with anything negative, and giving reasonable advice assuming those statistics are accurate"" are in error, regardless of the accuracy of the statistics.",1364422067

1303155,comment,1301423,1301626,0,0,jsankey,,,"In fact, this the key reason that you need to have <i>automated</i> tests.  I don't know anyone that commits a new feature without trying it -- be it (conveniently) at a REPL or via some other UI.  But the manual ""trying it out"" method, REPL or otherwise, has always suffered from the fact that it cannot be easily repeated, so old features eventually get broken, and nobody notices.  This is why I automate my tests, because their value over time exceeds the extra cost to write them vs. trying it out.<p>I think this is an aspect that the original article fails to take into account.  Eliding tests can feel very liberating, and it allows you to plow ahead adding new features faster.  Particularly in small, or at least new, projects.  But over time reality catches up, and the lack of tests becomes a burden.  You start avoiding adding new features, and particularly improving existing code, out of fear of breaking something.  And so you end up more constrained than if you had added the right balance of tests along the way.<p>Writing software that is maintainable, with staying power of years or decades, requires the sacrifice of some up-front productivity.",1272499197

1303151,comment,1301360,1302301,0,0,bwh2,,,"Nice work<p>* The new search button is much better.<p>* I would switch the news articles to change on click, not mouseover. The distance between map marker and news link is too far; too many other markers can accidentally be moused over. This is most obvious when mousing over a marker that is surrounded by other markers (typically like Swiss results). Plus, when you click, you expect something to happen, not so much when you mouseover.<p>* You should make the fonts a consistent size between the input fields, select fields, and their labels.<p>* The Facebook like button is a little lost in the top right. I would consider putting it just below the bottom left corner on the map.<p>* The thumbs look better. I would still pad them 3-5px more on the right. Then make the title text flush with the top of the images.<p>* Your bottom banner ad jumps around depending on the length of article results. Presumably, you'll want to change that.<p>* But all of these things kind of play 2nd fiddle to having more markers appear on the map and making the article results seem more closely tied to the map results. The example of searching ""Obama"" and only seeing one marker on the US is the kind of thing to fix.<p>* BTW, good job on making the page load fast.",1272499039

1303141,comment,1298215,1300320,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'll try and keep this short, so we don't waste time in a dead thread (but you're welcome to email if you like).<p>1. I agree the trade secret is questionable. But an employee having it off-campus isn't a release into the wild. Gizmodo even wrote an article about how well it was disguised, calling it '[a] very ingenious solution to protect future designs from lookeyloos'. It's hard to argue Apple intentionally abandoned their IP; and although the exterior shell was removable, the finder did not disassemble the device within. So when Gizmodo got it, the only information 'in the wild' - which was published by Engadget, who were also offered the device - was its external appearance.<p>2. Gawker paid $5000, by their own admission. Clearly they considered the likely provenance of the phone to have commercial value, and I think that part is legitimate - the loss of a prototype by a famously secretive firm <i>is</i> newsworthy for both consumers and stockholders, who have an interest in the integrity of the firm's IP. Gawker certainly has no obligation to help Apple keep their reputation for security intact.<p>Arguably it was stolen under CA law, arguably that put Gawker in a position of receiving, knowing that it could not be legally saleable under the circumstances. And arguably they took the phone with the intent of returning it to Apple, and what they paid for was the story of how it was lost and found, making it newsworthy as above.<p>Where I part ways with Gawker is in what occurred next. Believing it was likely a prototype they could easily infer that it belonged to Apple; and being experienced tech journalists, they certainly knew how to get of hold of someone senior there, describe the device and its attached ID labels, and confirm its authenticity. A quick look at California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act would have apprised them that a prototype device is itself a trade secret, and that they <i>did</i> have a duty of care, under subparagraph (b)(2)(C) of the UTSA: <i>['Misappropriation' means .. disclosure or use .. by someone who] Before a material change of his or her position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.</i><p>So - loss of protoype phone, not a secret. External appearance of same - also not a secret, Engadget has republished the finder's own photos. Acquisition of device - defensible, even with money involved. So far, so good. Take all the pictures you want, call Apple, confirm and return, publish and be damned. Prior restraint is a barrier to any injunctions from Apple, as shown by <i>Ford Motor Co. v Lane.</i><p>But this is not what happened. Instead, Gawker, acting as Chen's employers, 'dissected' (their word) the device, up to the point of Chen losing confidence in his ability to reassemble it, and published the results.<p>Now this seems to me like a clear violation of not only the UTSA (creating civil liability) but the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, specifically title 18, ยง 1832.  I suggest that Gawker converted possession of a prototype device, destined for an existing global market, into advertising revenue based on readership, knowing that publication of the device's internal construction would injure Apple by benefiting competitors and counterfeiters.<p>I think they have violated this law in multiple ways, and <i>possibly</i> violated laws against receiving and fraud (for misrepresentation of fact to the finder/seller and employees about their liability under civil and criminal law).<p>3. Yes, I think Gawker's published version of events is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a crime and that the federal statute cited provides for a very broad search. To my mind the only question is how far up Gawker's chain of command the responsibility goes.<p>4. How do we know? Gawker parlays its audience into sometimes exclusive access to  products, services and information in the various industries it covers. They have actively solicited confidential commercial information for cash, relying on their journalistic privilege to protect them. Is it not possible that they, or one of their staff, would share a trade secret for some <i>quid pro quo</i>, given their professed lack of ethical inhibitions?<p>Yes, it is indeed an aggressive approach by the police. But skilled technologists have been known to destroy digital evidence, and Gawker blogs have published a articles on topics like concealment or permanent deletion of digital information...as recently as last month. And no, I'm not sure I would trust a promise to voluntarily abstain from doing so.",1272498663

First is this cute but silly idea that the study of PR is so difficult and rigorous that it makes people cry.<p>The second way this is funny, is just imagining young PR flacks crying because their papers were graded badly. That just warms up my heart. I mean the thought that a human being would be so depraved (or is forced by the economy into such a depraved condition) as to dream about being a PR person when they grow up is rather depressing. But thinking of them suffering along the way is a bit of a bright spot.<p>Unfortunately, the whole thing was written by a PR professor so I just don't believe it.

Anonymity is not so easy to protect.  Only a small fraction of people comment online.  A given manager only manages a small number of people.  If a negative comment appears, frequently it is surprisingly easy to make an educated guess.  If the comment is at all detailed, an analysis of writing style will usually confirm that guess.  Unless a large fraction of people in your environment are commenting, the level of anonymity is limited.

Solitary profession, very few people make a living out of it, mostly introverts.<p><i>The school puts out a notice in the community looking for a writer who would take on an apprentice ten hours a week. The apprenticeship would pay something around minimum wage, but would also involve the apprentice building something of value on their own with at least some of that time.</i><p>Who pays them? If this is educational why are they being paid? Why should the writer help the apprentice at all?

It certainly isn't worth the writer's while to pay them.<p><i>So, for example, I might have the apprentice spend five hours a week doing grunt work for me, then I would spend five hours each week with that person helping them to build a blog to share their writing, polish their writing skills, and so forth.</i><p>What grunt work?

One month study, three months internship, six cycles, you don't get paid. I cannot see how this would not be a better deal than a Masters in Journalism.<p>On the same lines Germany has a _proper_ apprenticeship system, 3 months professional school study, 3 months work experience, you stay with the same company the whole time (gotta find one to sponsor you first) and generally they hire you afterwards.

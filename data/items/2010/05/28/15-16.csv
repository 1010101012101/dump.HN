Every day that they are delayed, thousands die.<p>Maybe hard choices will have to be made: very low birth rates, or some rate of voluntary deaths (religious people who refuse to take the therapies, maybe?), etc. Maybe it'll be no problem because of technological advances (molecular manufacturing, advanced biotech, etc) and we'll have more than enough resources for everybody, and can colonize other planets.<p>But these problems caused by people not dying so much seem to be smaller than 100k-150k people dying each day after a long-period of suffering and frailty, causing pain to their families and friends. We've cured many diseases and fixed many of humanity's problems so far, and the benefits seem to outweigh the costs.

He also co-founded a gaming studio that saw a modest exit (<50k) before his MBA. He has been working on this idea throughout his time in business school and is now graduating. He has a design document with mockups.<p>Eddie will be working on this startup full-time. He is in charge of business and game design.<p>Mark: Mark has been a software engineer for five years, at major companies and startups.<p>Mark has a 20 hrs/week part-time job at a software firm. The remaining time will be dedicated to the startup. \nMark will be writing the software and building the UI.<p>Fred: Fred has been a software engineer for four years at major companies.\nFred has a full-time job at a software firm, and will spend the remaining time at the startup. \nHe will be writing the software with Mark, as well as any future native mobile apps.<p>Mark and Fred cofounded a startup and ran it for two years (lets call it Flippr) in the social space. Flippr did not gain significant traction, so they decided to join forces with Eddie. Code from Flippr is projected to be 35% of the new project. Mark and Fred built a prototype of the new project in a couple of weeks, based on Eddies design document.<p>Other Notes:\n- Everyone will be working for sweat equity. No funding yet.\n- The team gets along and would like to work together.\n- Company expenses are split equally among the team.<p>Given the circumstances mentioned above, what equity split is fair?

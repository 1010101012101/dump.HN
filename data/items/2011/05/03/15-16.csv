Having my first daughter dying was one of the worst things that ever happened to me. It slowly, but totally changed my life. Emotionally, I just hardened up. My outlook on life changed (realising the one chance to live, life is precious, enjoy every second, etc. etc.).<p>The other horrible event in my life was a series of severe panic/psychosis attacks. I stood next to my girlfriend, and truly did not know if I was me, if she was anybody, if I was an alien, or what. And then it was just a feeling of ""absolute terror"". You're utterly and completely terrified - no ""reason"", just a total sensation of dread. I would have cut my legs off if it would have stopped it. (BTW, this was all before I tried LSD.)<p>So, when I say ""powerful"", I mean, reflecting back on my life, looking at the events that stand out, that truly had an impact, that are ""amazing"" - what would those be? In no particular order:<p><pre><code>  - The birth of my children (the first time I almost fainted, not from the blood but just from sheer awesomeness of holding her in my arms).\n\n  - The loss of my first child (when the doctor shook his head, I just collapsed, not to mention the effects for years to come).\n\n  - Panic attacks\n\n  - Some of the times my wife and I have made love.\n\n  - LSD: Even just the experience, let alone the impact on my life.\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, it's a ""lifetime experience"".",1304438212

Somebody else pointed me toward lsyncd which seems to take an interesting (inotify-based) approach which might meet your ""in the background"" requirement better, but I don't have any experience with it.  I know there are lots of others, with varying levels of maturity and ""intelligence"" regarding things like conflicts and moves/renames, but it's such a crowded field that I don't claim to be an expert.<p>My attitude is generally is that if you start with something that can be used live then it's trivial to use it for syncing instead, whereas something that's originally designed for syncing might never go the other way.  Right now I just rsync to the remote directory, then from it, whenever I feel like.  I could automate the process, or replace rsync with something more sophisticated, but my focus is mostly on the remote-infrastructure side because that's where I see a dearth of suitable alternatives.",1304438073

One could go on at length about such actors: Burt Reynolds, Don Knotts, Patrick Swayze...<p>The author does come to the correct conclusion: remove copyright protection for Hollywood for increased social good.<p>My own, totally unsupported by evidence thought is that the porn movie industry gets used for money laundering.  It's possible for criminal organizations to funnel many small amounts (some from each ""soldier"" each day) through on-line porn sites and CCBILL card processing.  The small amount per transaction doesn't raise any banking-law flags.

MDMA gives you a sense of euphoria while slightly altering your perception (it's considered a slight psychedelic in that sense) - it also makes you very empathic to the people you are with. MDMA isn't like a love potion, usually, once you come down you go back to being ""you"". It doesn't make you addicted to the people you experienced it with at all. What it <i>does</i> do is open you all up, so at <i>controlled</i> doses that can be highly beneficial in a therapeutic setting because both people will feel love for each other and empathy. Which, at a controlled dose, they should also be able to coherently iron out their issues.<p>Once they come down, they go back to being who/what they were, but with a whole lot more ""sharing"" now - they both now know how each other feel because it was expressed out of love and empathy rather than witheld or stated in a defensive/offensive manner.<p>Psychedelics really shouldn't be toyed with unless you are psychologically stable - if you can imagine, being ""normal"", then psychedelics take you to the reciprocal of ""normal"". I've played with Magic Mushrooms and really hated the experience, I also did two nights of Ayahuasca - extremely powerful experience, beyond LSD for sure, but a very rough ride (Ayahuasca is a shamanic ""purging"" psychedelic, it causes you to vomit uncontrollably while having the hallucinogenic and psychedelic experience of LSD x 5 for about 8 to 10 hours straight).<p>I will say this: I believe all of the benefits people would seek in the use of mind-altering substances can, without question, be found through meditation - deliberate thinking - introspection - and just ""chilling the fuck out"".",1304437873

The drugs allow you to explore feelings that you're otherwise not able to explore, and work through whatever emotional roadblocks you're having with your partner. Essentially it lets you find the source of your anxiety and problems, when normally you'd just be really anxious and unhappy all the time but you wouldn't know why. And then once you know why you are unhappy it allows you to communicate these feelings with each other so that you can use them to rebuild the relationship. It does also make you love and care much more about the other person's wellbeing, which is an important part of the process, but it's not why it works. The love and empathy part is just what allows you to fix your relationship, it's not actually what fixes it.<p>""I've never taken LSD but I don't think I would ever want to put myself in the sort of situation that trivializes the death of a child by making it equivalent to downing a pill.""<p>You should take some time to learn about what the experience is actually like.

In short, I assumed that it was possible to use XMLHttpRequest from a Javascript application to call Twitter, Facebook and other web-enabled APIs. It turns out that for a service that returns JSON or XML, you can't call a web service (from javascript running inside a browser) that is not in the same domain as the original webpage. (Well ... IE lets you do it, but it gives you a nasty security warning. Other browsers I tried seem to block the request completely). It turns out that there is a workaround ... if the web service returns JSONP, you can use a script tag to make the web service call.<p>I have some specific questions, but would certainly appreciate related thoughts.<p>1) Is this really how it is supposed to work? Am I missing something? If this is how ""it"" is supposed to work, then ""it"" is lame.\n2) How common is jsonp in web service APIs? Is this a non-standard hack or widely used by web companies.\n3) One obvious workaround to the whole mess is to just make the web service calls from the server side and relay data to the client browser.

I really don't understand the fascination with ORMs today. Some sort of sql-to-object translation layer is no doubt a great thing, but any time you write ""sql"" in a non-sql language like python or ruby you are letting go of any ability to optimize your queries. For reasonably complicated and trafficked websites that's a disaster simply waiting to happen. This isn't just blind speculation on my part, I've heard a great many stories where very significant resources had to be dedicated to removing ORM from the architecture, and the twitter example should familiar to most.<p>I would go so far as to say that sql writing ORMs are a deeply misguided engineering idea in and of itself, not just badly implemented in its current incarnations. You can't possibly write data access logic entirely in your front end and expect some system to magically create and query a data store for you in the best or even close to the best way.<p>I think the real reason people use ORMs is because they don't have someone at the company that can actually competently operate a sql database, and at any company of a decent size traffic-wise that's simply a fatal mistake. Unless you are going 100% nosql, at which point this discussion is irrelevant.",1304436488

I work in an agile process as a software architect, and ""Here's the spec, implement it"" is <i>exactly</i> what I get pressured to do by product owners, scrum masters, and yes, sometimes even by developers, who naturally feel insulted by the idea of having an architect ""over"" them and have no desire to collaborate on design.<p>The biggest problem with the idea of software architecture is that it's turned into a job title.  It stunts both architects and developers by attempting to divide the labor of programming.  We are all programmers, and programming is really just design, from the lowest level of designing lines of code up to the highest level of designing distributed systems.  Software architects who don't write code get stale very quickly.  The longer-tenured architects at the company I work for are sad sacks.  I've been on calls where they ""reviewed"" and approved ""designs"" that were actually questionnaires filled in by my product owner and fact-checked by me.  The documents they read, while accurate, did not allow them to understand the work on any level at all.  Their job was to check for things such as, what browsers will this be tested against?  You get on a conference call with them, they ask some bizarre questions based on misconceptions they got from inaccurately reading between the very widely spaced lines, they don't understand the answers, and then they rubber-stamp the paperwork.  That's apparently a significant part of their job.<p>Meanwhile, the developers are encouraged to remain code monkeys because that division of labor makes sense to management.  To the developers, this seems like disrespect, and it is, though it isn't as insulting as they think, because management doesn't realize that they're basically saying that developers sucks at half their job.<p>I don't think ""architect"" should be a title.  Everyone should have the same basic title.  Call it ""developer"" or whatever.  Just make it clear that we're all doing the same kind of work.  Gradations are okay:  junior, senior, longbeard, whatever.  There are a million differentiations between different programmers in practice.  Senior developers should help junior developers when they need it.  Developers should consult with other developers on any difficult or momentous decisions.  Some people should be focused on the big picture, but not everyone at the same time.  At any moment, some developers will be working on prototypes and new projects, and other developers will be working on maintenance.  People will develop expertise and ownership.  The point is that every difference is <i>personal</i>.  One developer may write stellar systems-level code but have unfortunate taste when it comes to designing distributed systems that work together over a network.  One developer may be slow at finishing new projects but good at ferreting out bugs.<p>That's why you need have technical managers with power who make situation-specific judgments about who does what.  And that's what this is all about:  replacing personal judgment with rules and formulas.  Who should design and implement System X, Doug or Sam?  Doug, Sam, and their boss know their capabilities.  Doug would like to design and implement System X, but their boss knows that is a stretch for Doug and is too risky for the given time frame.   Sam knows she can design and implement System X, and so does her boss.  So Sam should design and implement the system.  Horrible!  Unacceptable!  Unscientific!  Everyone should be assigned tasks based on their job title.  Since Sam seems more capable than Doug in this situation, let's give her the title ""Software Architect.""  She will design System X.  Since Doug seems less capable in this situation, let's give him the title ""Developer.""  He will implement System X.<p>What happens next release when there's a system that Doug really ought to design, to stretch his design skills or because it's in an area he knows well?  Well, you can promote him, and then he'll be theoretically ""assignable"" to design any project.  If you don't want to promote him, then Sam will do the design and he'll be stuck implementing it.  Sam, of course, will be kept busy with design work and ""supporting"" Doug, so she won't code much, and pretty soon she'll be useless and will spend her time in meetings ""representing"" engineering, telling sales what's possible and what isn't and hoping that her answers aren't invalidated by things that have changed behind her back.  Doug, of course, is busy changing things behind her back, because he only gets to make design-impacting decisions if he doesn't admit that they <i>are</i> design-impacting.<p>Wow, this is really a subject that gets me worked up.  So much for my productivity this morning.  I'm an architect, and God help me, I do not want to have this title at the next company I go to.",1304435644

I used to think that the judges in cases like music piracy were just dishonest and in bed with RIAA. Now, I understand the situation is even worse: they are <i>totally clueless</i> about basic technology.

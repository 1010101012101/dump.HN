They're not sure enough that it's a intruder to call the police, but they'd like to get back to sleep, make sure the children aren't getting molested, etc.<p>And WRT to the latter, while of course no one is recommending they clear a building with any weapon, if they have to rescue a child, if there are multiple intruders, if they'd like to make a phone call (e.g. 911) while having the weapon fully ready, there are power/flash and sound issues, over/vs. under-penetration (OK, there are no great solutions there) ...

There are always reports of LiPo (as they are commonly known) packs puffing-up and sometimes catching on fire and even exploding (more like the popping of a pop-corn bag except that you have flames shooting out of it). I have personally exploded a small 3S (three cells in series) pack just to see the mechanism and the magnitude of the effect.  I have to say that it took a LOT of work to explode the pack.  I over-charged it to a ridiculous degree.<p>Now, of course, there are also reports of packs catching on fire for no apparent reason at all.  There are many explanations out there.  The best I came across was from a PhD Chemist who explained it something like this (paraphrasing, of course):  When these batteries are assembled there's moisture in the surrounding environment.  And, while moisture is kept in check, some of it stays in the pack.  They can't run a super-dry environment because it could be very dangerous.  One of the electrodes is lithium-oxide infused in carbon. Lithium reacts with water, which gives you hydrogen.  Carbon reacts with hydrogen to give you methane. As methane is generated the cell puff-up. If thermal runaway is triggered through other mechanisms and the methane ignites: kaboom!<p>I keep about thirty LiPo packs in strong locked and vented steel container (heavy toolbox) in the garage away from flammable materials and flame sources.  When we go to the flying field the same container is used to transport to the field.  While at the field the container is always locked and, if possible, removed from the car.  I have never had an incident I did not cause.<p>As far as the Boeing issues.  Hard to say from the outside.  It could boil down to quality issues at their battery supplier.  It is probably impossible to perform a full inspection on these kinds of batteries on delivery.  How do you determine if there's too much moisture inside a sealed package?",1358390646

""The Casimir Effect Enhancement (CEE) program seeks to manipulate forces very near surfaces to enable control of small-scale phenomena, including nanodevice adhesion and friction.  The objectives of this single-phase DARPA program are to demonstrate unambiguous detection, neutralization, and dynamic manipulation of the Casimir force to modulate between normal and neutralized states.  Some approaches to these program goals include the development of new materials, engineered nanostructures, or active elements. Recent research activities (models and experiments) have already identified manipulation of the Casimir force as an important challenge.""<p>Edit: To clarify the feedback loop comment: I think the jury is still out on the effect of economic incentives. In my opinion, looking at the degradation of privately funded pure research over the last 30-40 years (Bell, Xerox PARC, etc), economic incentives are only effective once someone (usually academia funded by the gov't) has laid the ground work.

Because, you know, as an entrepreneur, yes, value is always important, but price is always, always, always important.  Fairness too.<p>25% is ridiculous.  The recruiter is NOT generating the employee's value, the employee is.  And don't go for the ""you would not have found them if it were not for the recruiter"".  In my experience there are very few recruiters that actually add value to the process.  Most are horrible resume farms that algorithmically (or not) match resumes with job requirements and barrage the employer with a bunch of candidates to see if something sticks. In other words, the quest for easy money rather than anything else.  The more people and companies you shovel through the system the greater your probabilities of making money.<p>How many of us have received the formulaic email from some data-entry worker in India saying something like:  ""I came across your resume and it looks like a perfect fit for one of our clients.  Please submit resume, availability, desired salary and ability to relocate.""  Right.<p>There are a few (definitely count them with one hand) companies that might truly do a good job of getting to know both candidate and employer, but these days, that is far, very far, from the norm.<p>I offered that 5% might be a good number.

5070536,comment,5069542,5070076,7,0,notJim,,,"I switched to vim a year ago, and I fucking love it. The one thing I miss from ST2 is column editing/multiple cursors. Column editing fulfills the same kind of need as basic usage of vim macros, I think (i.e., applying some kind of sequence of edits to multiple rows), but it's visual and you get instant feedback (across all rows), which makes it easier and something you can sort of feel out iteratively.<p>For example, supposed I have a row like (making up these names as I go, and suppose the list is longer):<p><pre><code>  Controller_Section
  House_Model
  Person_To_Category_Selector
</code></pre>
and I want to insert after the first underscore the word class, so I'd get Controller_Class_Section and so on (this is a contrived example, but one has to do these kinds of things sometimes.)<p>In vim, I think I'd record a macro, but I'd probably forget some parts (like moving to the next line at the end) and have to undo and whatnot (could use a regex too, but that's a bit harder--I'm practicing recently to be able to do it more effortlessly.)<p>In ST2, what you do first is create a cursor at the beginning of each row (option + down arrow on OS X.)  Then you move ahead one word (Opt + Right arrow on OS X.) Now the cursor is right before the underscore, even though the underscore is in a different position on each row. You can see that it's in the right place <i>on each row</i>, so it's hard to make a mistake, and if you need to do something more complicated, that remains true. Then, you just type _Class, and it types live <i>on each row</i>, once again making it so you get instant feedback, and it's hard to make a mistake.<p>That to me is the biggest actual advantage of ST2 over VIM, but there are other reason to not switch, like vim's steeper learning curve (when most of us are already busy, and learning other stuff at the same time), and the fact that some people prefer the mouse, which behaves strangely in vim.",1358389097

He said the level of radioactivity was a small fraction of the amount naturally in the fish. But to your question, the answer is yes, MSRs would pollute less in the worst scenario.<p>It's true they will generate cesium, because that's one of the things left after you fission atoms. However, since it's liquid fuel, the cesium can be removed continually and taken away to storage. (I think the idea is to encase it in glass and bury it.) The amount of cesium in the reactor at any given time is much smaller than for solid-fuel reactors.<p>Also, fission products like cesium are chemically contained in the molten salt. If something breaks open the reactor, the salt will escape, quickly cool, and solidify, containing the cesium. You'll get hot rocks at the reactor site but no radioactive cloud over your community.<p>Many of the engineers claim the reactor wouldn't need water cooling, so it wouldn't have to be on a shoreline. Put it in the desert if you want.",1358388027

The cost of setting up this structure is less than $1000/company/year (in many jurisdictions, and especially if you do this en masse, down to $100-$200/year). However, piercing it is an exercise in futility and is more of the order of $10000/company - and if you try anything more than discovering ownership chain, more like $100,000 company)",1358388005

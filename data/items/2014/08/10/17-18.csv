Carefully weighing tradeoffs and making good choices in the face of uncertainty is kind of the reason they pay architects and people with those kinds of jobs so much",1407693514

Some problem/solutions I&#x27;ve seen:<p>* Programmers split work by taking ownership on modules, treat modules by other programmers as black boxes, and use bower with a company hosted server to manage dependencies.<p>* Some programmers I&#x27;ve spoken to have tried using requirejs or bower to manage dependencies, but most I&#x27;ve talked to dislike the overhead this causes.<p>* Large apps dynamically load routes on-demand. The core angularjs framework is not built for this, but numerous hacks have been put forward by the community to handle dynamic loading of javascript modules, and honestly, it&#x27;s not that bad. Thankfully, built-in support for dynamic loading of components is on the angular roadmap.<p>* Personally, I annotate my files such that, for any dynamically injected reference, the reader can directly navigate to the source file. Google closure syntax, browserify, and requirejs also provide this support.<p>I hope those anecdotes help.",1407693259
8160230,comment,8158076,8158354,4,0,dredmorbius,,,"How you pay for work performed is a complex matter.  It&#x27;s one that Adam Smith covers (as he does most topics) at length in <i>Wealth of Nations</i>.  In particular he warns of the tendency to pitch compensation terms such that workers are <i>overincentivized</i> to work, reducing their overall productivity and burning out faster.<p><a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm</a><p>(I&#x27;m adding some paragraph breaks to Smith&#x27;s text, this is a single paragraph in the original.  Emphasis added as well.)<p>&quot;<i>The liberal reward of labour, as it encourages the propagation, so it increases the industry of the common people.</i> The wages of labour are the encouragement of industry, which, like every other human quality, improves in proportion to the encouragement it receives. A plentiful subsistence increases the bodily strength of the labourer, and the comfortable hope of bettering his condition, and of ending his days, perhaps, in ease and plenty, animates him to exert that strength to the utmost. <i>Where wages are high, accordingly, we shall always find the workmen more active, diligent, and expeditious, than where they are low;</i> in England, for example, than in Scotland; in the neighbourhood of great towns, than in remote country places.<p>&quot;Some workmen, indeed, when they can earn in four days what will maintain them through the week, will be idle the other three. This, however, is by no means the case with the greater part. <i>Workmen, on the contrary, when they are liberally paid by the piece, are very apt to overwork themselves, and to ruin their health and constitution in a few years.</i> A carpenter in London, and in some other places, <i>is not supposed to last in his utmost vigour above eight years.</i> Something of the same kind happens in many other trades, in which the workmen are paid by the piece; as they generally are in manufactures, and even in country labour, wherever wages are higher than ordinary. Almost every class of artificers is subject to some peculiar infirmity occasioned by excessive application to their peculiar species of work. Ramuzzini, an eminent Italian physician, has written a particular book concerning such diseases.<p>&quot;We do not reckon our soldiers the most industrious set of people among us; yet <i>when soldiers have been employed in some particular sorts of work, and liberally paid by the piece, their officers have frequently been obliged to stipulate with the undertaker, that they should not be allowed to earn above a certain sum every day,</i> according to the rate at which they were paid. Till this stipulation was made, mutual emulation, and the desire of greater gain, frequently prompted them to overwork themselves, and to hurt their health by excessive labour.<p>&quot;Excessive application, during four days of the week, is frequently the real cause of the idleness of the other three, so much and so loudly complained of. Great labour, either of mind or body, continued for several days together is, in most men, naturally followed by a great desire of relaxation, which, if not restrained by force, or by some strong necessity, is almost irresistible. It is the call of nature, which requires to be relieved by some indulgence, sometimes of ease only, but sometimes too of dissipation and diversion. If it is not complied with, the consequences are often dangerous and sometimes fatal, and such as almost always, sooner or later, bring on the peculiar infirmity of the trade.<p>&quot;If masters would always listen to the dictates of reason and humanity, they have frequently occasion rather to moderate, than to animate the application of many of their workmen. It will be found, I believe, in every sort of trade, that the man who works so moderately, as to be able to work constantly, not only preserves his health the longest, but, in the course of the year, executes the greatest quantity of work.&quot;",1407693245

Apple will often give them slightly different scope (port OSX to the iPhone, add functionality to the iPod OS, see which project can ship first / deliver the best product).<p>Problem solving is more or less lognormal. You can squash a trivial bug in minutes or weeks, depending on whether or not you spot the cause of it. This can actually save man hours - as you don&#x27;t have someone staring at stack dumps for weeks without making any progress whatsoever - you just tell them on the second day that a co-worker found the error, and ask if they can think of any other things that might be wrong (now that they&#x27;ve got the provisional fix).<p>I can see a lot of comments worrying about the efficiency of this - what if two people solve the problem at the same time? What if the quick fix isn&#x27;t a good? Well, that&#x27;s a good problem to have - one engineer / team didn&#x27;t really fix it, and one did - you&#x27;ve just saved yourself from the risk of missing the root cause!<p>Yes, there might be a few painful meetings, especially when two different approaches have been shown to work.

I think the answer is that you don&#x27;t build large systems using consensus; you bootstrap large systems with very small systems using consensus.  The very small systems are reasonably assumed to have no Byzantine faults (i.e. just like you more or less rely on a single database server not to have faults).<p>All the systems I know of that use consensus are meant to be small, e.g. run on 5 machines or so (and of course the membership is fixed).

If you were using 0.66 milliwatt-hours per day and had two 20,000 milliwatt-hour batteries, it would of course last for 60,606 days. Which is 160 years not 4 years.<p>Of course, you&#x27;d also need to power the radio module to send the SMS, and presumably wolves spend time in remote regions with poor cell phone coverage Products like the Quectel M10 can use as much as 2 watts while transmitting [1] (or as little as a fifth of that). To make 40,000 milliwatt-hours of batteries last for 5 years would only give you a budget of 21 milliwatt-hours (75 joules) per day. That would let your run a 2 watt transmitter for about 37 seconds a day - so to make 8 transmissions a day you&#x27;d have to power on, join the network, transmit, and power down again in less than 5 seconds.<p>On the other hand, according to [2] it takes between 1.5 and 5.5 joules to send an SMS, allowing us to send several in a budget of 75 joules per day. They don&#x27;t make much mention of signal strength or the energy cost of connecting to the network, unfortunately.<p>So I guess it all comes down to how long you have to have your radio module turned on in order to get a message off.<p>There are also tracking collars with solar cells [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Quectel_M10_datasheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Quectel_M10_datasheet.pdf</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://mobiledevices.kom.aau.dk/research/energy_measurements_on_mobile_phones/results/cellular_communication/sms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobiledevices.kom.aau.dk/research/energy_measurements...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.rvc.ac.uk/SML/People/awilson/Wildlife-tracking-collars.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rvc.ac.uk/SML/People/awilson/Wildlife-tracking-co...</a>",1407691441

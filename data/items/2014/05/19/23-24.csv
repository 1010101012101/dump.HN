7770508,comment,7767779,7769606,4,0,chavesn,,,"> <i>What about your cache, should we just introduce HTTP into the caching mechanism and hope that one of your clients has the data you wanted to deliver to someone else?</i><p>HTTP caching is a standard built explicitly for this. And it&#x27;s gotten better at precisely these jobs over the years (substitute for server memory and indexes). So if that &quot;someone&quot; is the user who has the cache, yes.<p>> <i>Are your clients going to be responsible for ensuring you don&#x27;t max out your server with the amount of processes your httpd can handle?</i><p>HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect.  420 Enhance Your Calm.  Keep-alive.  Etc.  There are many standards in place to let the client participate in not overloading the server.  The server must always be willing to deal with a new actor, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t systems in place to help clients be nice to servers that are overloaded without breaking other parts of the spec (caching).<p>> <i>Decades of networking work, by extremely talented individuals, to make sure the client has to do very little lifting at the layers closer to the metal by people much, much smarter than us.</i><p>I don&#x27;t see any evidence that all that networking work is to make sure that clients don&#x27;t need to <i>do work</i>.  Instead, I see many clever systems on both client and server being created to push the boundaries of resource usage past previous limits.<p>On the server, it sounds like you are familiar with these techniques.  Load-balancing, edge-caching, distributed applications, etc.<p>On the client, it must come about through standards and behavior specifications.  If you&#x27;re imagining a world where servers are placing requirements on clients before they are ready to handle them, I agree, that would be awful.  Servers should always have ultimate responsibility for being a good host to any potential connection.<p>However, <i>once a client behavior standard has been well agreed upon for a significant amount of time</i>, then servers should absolutely take advantage of the behavior.  Should programmers of web application skip any of the behaviors above (HTTP caching and REST), or shun JSON APIs or pushState or any of those things?<p>No way! They should take full advantage, as long as they know what they are doing. And yes, you do have to still be a responsible citizen (for your own good as much as anyone&#x27;s).<p>For example, if you use pushState, you still must keep in mind how search engines may observe your pages[1].  Using cache expirations aggressively but correctly still takes some careful planning. And so on.<p>But the principle of &quot;offloading&quot; as you put brings the possibility of optimization by factor of N, where N is your audience size, instead of some constant K as many other server-side optimization are limited.<p>This is not &quot;nullifying&quot; anyone&#x27;s networking work.  Clients, <i>under carefully grown and tested behavior standards</i>, _<i>should</i>_ be able to do some lifting.<p>If you want to talk about user experience, that&#x27;s a whole other issue.  And yes, there is significant evidence (responding to your earlier comment) that things have gotten better -- just a couple years ago, web fonts were almost unusable because of the flicker that happened on load.  I am sure some clients still see it, but for my own personal use, the flicker is virtually 100% gone.<p>If the client can&#x27;t display the page in a reasonable replacement time for the server, then it&#x27;s a no-go.  But if it can, it&#x27;s a huge win and IMHO doesn&#x27;t subtract anything from the (admittedly genius) networking stacks underneath.<p>Finally, if the technology in these networking layers could so easily be nullified by so-called &quot;ignorant&quot; individuals, wouldn&#x27;t it be not-so-brilliant to begin with?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/6194427/143295"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/6194427/143295</a>",1400543458

If you come with your own architecture for your app, you are only creating a framework if you then abstract that architecture and embody it in software in such a way that it can be used for other apps.<p>However, there are so many layers and necessary abstractions in a web app that I think you do end up with a framework in practice.

I&#x27;m not sure if it would go by other names, but we call it phone banking in my area. It would be great if a tool like this existed which added support for:<p>* Importing lists of people to call<p>* Support for multiple callers to pull off that list<p>* Connecting callers with an app that can provide them a list of #s to tap, and then fill in responses<p>* Step-by-step / flow-charted interaction builder with feedback options if a user has a laptop or second device in front of them. For example:<p>> &quot;[Sir or madam], I&#x27;m [name] calling on behalf of [organization] \n> to ask questions about the upcoming election. Do you support \n> the right to marriage equality?&quot;<p>Square boxes should be filled in, bold, auto-magically provided. Then it should have a prompt:<p>> [Yes] [No] [Refused Call]<p>And then it takes you to the next stage of the flow chart, asking more questions.<p>* Beautiful, smart, geographic data visualization.

7770303,comment,7768900,7769857,2,0,malandrew,,,"As an employee I have mixed feelings here. For a long time (I&#x27;ve been with the company for 2 years), I was the main person at the company arguing for the basics necessary for all apps like you suggest we should have done. However, looking at this from the inside my view has changed to where the approach we&#x27;re taking probably makes the most sense long term even though it may not be immediately obvious.<p>First, the goal posts have moved. With iOS7 and Jelly Bean, the expectations of people building apps have become an impossibly high bar for the traditional web. If we had built a simple app framework, then we&#x27;d be competing with native apps circa 2009. I think that hyperlinks alone would have helped us win the battle against native apps, but there would always be lots of use cases we wouldn&#x27;t be able to touch.<p>Second, focusing on trying to do everything you can do with iOS and Android provided us with much more challenging performance constraints. This extremely high bar has resulted in a design where performance is considered in everything we do. If we didn&#x27;t squeeze out as much performance as possible, it would leave a much smaller margin for the developers using Famo.us. Looking at everyone who has built stuff with Famo.us, many people have been able to make demos and apps that compete easily with any mobile app built by very senior developers.<p>Furthermore, there is one major yet unrealized optimization that all the browser makers are aware of that once implemented will completely eliminate 90% of the overhead. Basically, HTML, being XML, inherits XML&#x27;s poor type system of only strings and children. When interfaces to the DOM were designed they adopted XML&#x27;s weak type system for the getters and setters. This means that when Famo.us sets a CSS 3D Matrix transform, it needs to take an array of floats, stringify it and then set the style property on a DOM element. Once set, the browser then needs to take this string and parse it back into an array of floats. This marshaling of an array of floats to a string and back again is horrible for performance. This is why Famo.us is currently limited to moving 200-400 surfaces simultaneously on a desktop browser. When this bottleneck is eliminated, everything changes. Famo.us which is relatively fast compared to all techniques out there will become several orders of magnitude faster.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is all the hate out there. Yes, we&#x27;ve misstepped in places. Is what we&#x27;ve built thus far perfect? No, not yet. We&#x27;re competing with operating systems that have years of head start on the web. If we want something that can compete with native, then we need to start building something that is as ambitious in scope with what already exists in native. What other option out there even comes close to giving us a path to combining an experience that is comparable to native (for the average web user, not us neckbeards), supports semantic web content (at the Surface level), has a faster development workflow for iterating on designs and supports the most important feature of the web: hyperlinks?<p>Lastly, I think the importance of native scrolling and other native-like features are actually overblown. I&#x27;ve been on the web long enough to remember when people used to say that webmail would never compete with desktop mail and that Excel would never compete with something like Google Spreadsheets. Even ExtJS was born out of the need to have a javascript framework that aped the Microsoft Windows look and feel.<p>What is so special about native scrolling that puts it on a pedestal where it cannot be disrupted? If we define &quot;quality&quot; as &quot;fitness for use&quot;, does our scroller yet meet the definition of a quality scroller for the desktop? No, we&#x27;ve got a ways to go. However for mobile devices, I would argue that Famo.us is definitely already there. I encourage everyone to take the demos we have, boot them up on a local server on your machine and view them on your phone or tablet. Those are definitely fit for use now and give you access to a market that is already larger than any native platform and can be opened via a link (many greenfield opportunities not available in native land).<p>There will come a time where native scroller is going to be shown to be the false god that it is. All you really need is to reach parity with respect to fitness for use and you&#x27;re at a tipping point where that&#x27;s no longer a hard and fast requirement. From there, things eventually shift far enough that it&#x27;s no longer a consideration.",1400540561

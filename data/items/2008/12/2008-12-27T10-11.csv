410972,comment,410517,410929,0,0,TheWama,,,"> it's very hard to make macro economic calculations like this. There are so many more factors that haven't been mentioned and surely there are some of those unknown unknowns lurking somewhere as well :-)<p>Right, in which case we should evaluate it some other way.  I think a good analogy can be illuminating.<p>Say we have an island population which consumes umbrellas (for shade) and coconuts (for food).  If there's a bubble in umbrellas, that means the island society built too many of them, falsely thinking it would be worthwhile to do so.  Since there's a glut of umbrellas, all the builder takes a loss, and probably lays off some or all of his newly-hired umbrella-building workforce.<p>But the umbrellas don't disappear, so it's not all bad, right?  Over time, the umbrellas will wear out and those in storage can be used.  That seems to be the gist of the article.<p>But this argument falls apart if you realize that the goal of any economic system, and particularly the free market system, is the <i>efficient</i> allocation of capital.  The most efficient arrangement on our hypothetical island would have been to make only umbrellas as are needed, when they're needed, built by a consistent, maintainable workforce, and leaving others free to do as they will.<p>This is true of infrastructure as well; businesses and societies flourish when the find the most efficient ways of doing things, and businesses found out a long time ago that holding excess stock is wasteful (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_in_time_manufacturing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_in_time_manufacturing</a>).  We should accept this and not try to paint a pretty face on waste.<p>They say that:<p>> Luxury riverside developments that now dot the banks of the Thames in London may be empty for the moment but will find occupiers eventually<p>but they fail to mention that by over-allocating goods and labor to large, luxury apartments they've reduced access to other things.  For example, more modest, economically sustainable apartments could have been built in the place of these, which would have meant more efficient, denser land-use.<p>Anyway, IMO this is all hogwash.  Of course it's not all for naught, but that doesn't means it's any good.",1230375116

410959,comment,410438,410652,0,0,taylan,,,"It has something to do with economics of punditry. Basically, for pundits incentives are against voicing dissent. If you go against the conventional wisdom and your predictions turn out to be right, you'll still have hard time getting your voice heard, since it will probably drown in a cacophony of ""nobody could have seen this coming"" type mainstream media flood. On the other hand, if you dissent from the crowd and turn out to be wrong, you'll be labeled a lunatic and sent to oblivion. So the punishment and the risk you're taking by far outweighs any possible rewards. Thus we get herding; pundits' predictions will always be closer to each other than they are to the real value of the thing being predicted.",1230372755

People are too isolated from prices and all the money the government pumps into the system inflates prices.<p>The whole healthcare cost problem would disappear almost immediately if people paid medical bills directly and were reimbursed for only the truly unforeseen medical expenses.  If doctors and hospitals were forced to compete on price like normal businesses, costs would plummet.  It's the lack of a real market that's the problem.  What other business has no prices out on display or in advertisements?  Try calling up a hospital and asking the cash price for a procedure.  It typically doesn't even exist; they're only set up to bill insurance companies and the government at different rates.<p>""Healthcare in the US is socialism without a central plan and capitalism without markets or prices.""",1230372723

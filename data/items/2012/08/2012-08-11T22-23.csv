This <i>is</i> harder!"") and also just the fact that I got used to awesome-wm as my first tiling WM. Sort of like vim/emacs or Ruby/Python.<p>The biggest issue for me is that although xmonad and awesome are both completely scriptable/configurable -- one of the benefits of having conf files that are ""alive"" -- xmonad is configured through Haskell while awesome is done through Lua.<p>To me -- a security guy who can sling code from scripting languages all over the place, but doesn't do <i>any</i> functional programming -- Lua is much easier to understand and use. Not everyone feels this way, and a lot of the configuration is just setting variables anyway.<p>I know many people who swear by xmonad, some of whom even used it at my suggestion, so please don't take this as a ""beware"" message. Try both out, and see which you like! :)",1344725986

4371216,comment,4369518,4370919,2,0,dkarl,,,"The trick is that the cat can create and destroy angular inertia at will by moving its legs towards or away from the axis of rotation.  Think of the front and back of the cat as being separate rotational systems with the same axis.  The first thing the cat does is <i>increase</i> the angular inertia of the back half and <i>decrease</i> the angular inertia of the front half.  Now the system is unbalanced.  The cat twists the front half around while the back half, with a much higher angular inertia, moves very little.  Next, the cat reverses the roles of front and back by decreasing the angular inertia of the back half and increasing the angular momentum of the front half.  Now the back half moves rotates all the way around while the front half moves very little.<p>A linear analogy would be a two balls connected by a spring oscillating in a vacuum.  If one ball is much lighter than the other -- like a football connected to a cannonball -- it moves a lot, while the cannonball moves very little.  Let's say the football and the cannonball are on a football field (a frictionless, vacuum-filled football field, of course.)  The cannonball is on the 50 yard line, staying roughly stationary, and the football is oscillating back and forth between the 49 yard line and the 47 yard line.  The system can't go anywhere if it starts with zero linear momentum, because the mass (linear inertia) of the balls remains fixed.  But imagine you can change the masses of the balls at will.  When the football reaches the 47 yard line, you swap the masses of the balls, so the football becomes very heavy and the cannonball becomes very light.  Now the football stays almost stationary at the 47 yard line, and the cannonball oscillates between the 48 yard line and the 50 yard line.  When the cannonball reaches the 48 yard line, you swap the masses so that the cannonball is once again very heavy and the football is very light.  Now the football is oscillating between the 47 yard line and the 45 yard line.  By swapping the masses repeatedly you can move down the field all the way to the end zone.<p>Because of conservation of mass/energy, you can't actually do that trick with linear inertia, but you can do it with angular inertia.  The front and back half of the cat are like the football and the cannonball, and the cat controls the angular inertia of each half by tucking and extending its legs.  When the cat is upside down, it increases the angular of inertia of its back half by extending its back legs, and it decreases the inertia of the front half by tucking its front legs.  Its back half acts like the cannonball, and its front half acts like the football.  That allows it to twist its front half around while the back half stays almost stationary.  Once the front half is right side up, it extends its front legs and tucks its back legs, effectively swapping the football and the cannonball.  In zero gravity, a cat could twist itself around that way as many times as it wanted:  just like the football and the cannonball working their way down the football field, except that it wouldn't violate any physical laws.",1344725362

We are all quite a long way from the economist's idealised rational actor.<p>I released my first real experiment <a href=""http://itunes.com/apps/fastlists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.com/apps/fastlists</a> (yes it's another lists app but it is currently free, with no ads and has a couple of useful features making it especially useful for reusable lists for shopping, packing etc. The design is functional rather than beautiful).<p>I'm currently adding some in-app purchase options to test the reactions of the users.<p>My current idea is to offer the following options: (price tiers equate to $1 or local equivalents I think)<p>1) No-ads (tier 1 price)<p>2) Privacy - No anonymous usage collection.(tier 1 price)<p>3) Raise item limit (by 100 to 200 items) (tier 1 price)<p>4) Unlimited items (tier 3 price)<p>5) Everything including future in-app features (tier 5)<p>For me option 5 is important because I hate feeling I will need to keep paying bit by bit for something. It will include everything that doesn't need server side support and expense. I actually hope most customers choose this, the other items are there largely to justify the pricing of this item.<p>Ads and anonymous usage monitoring will come in releases after the purchases have become available as I want to give people the option to opt out first and for ads I will probably make the first month of use add free to try and get the user stuck in. I may also add some alternate skins as in-app purchases too later although that is lower priority than using the iOS 6 social framework as a way to try to get users promoting the app for me by sharing lists.<p>There is currently no item limit so I will allow existing users who installed before the limits were introduced to have unlimited items on the devices they have already installed on.<p>At the moment this is just a small scale test because I haven't done any promotion for the app yet so the current numbers of users is small although the reviews are currently very good (4.5* average in US and UK).<p>Any thoughts on the pricing model? Or the app?",1344725082

I have long had much the same opinions as the grand parent so was delighted to see such luminaries in agreement. Now, mathematics is compact but that is not the problem. The  problem is ambiguity. You can with time learn to pack the and unpack the extremely dense notation and the upfront costs are worth it but the ambiguity  (not to mention differing conventions across branches) is an inexcusable mess. Calculus for example is replete with the abuse of variable binding which is just cruel to the beginner.

1 In his book on mathematical pedagogy [17], Hans Freudenthal argues that the reliance on ambiguous, unstated notational conventions in such expressions as f(x) and df(x)/dx makes mathematics, and especially introductory calculus, extremely confusing for beginning students; and he enjoins mathematics educators to use more formal modern notation.<p>2 In his beautiful book Calculus on Manifolds [40], Michael Spivak uses functional notation. On p. 44 he discusses some of the problems with classical notation. We excerpt a particularly juicy passage:<p>The mere statement of [the chain rule] in classical notation requires the introduction of irrelevant letters. The usual evaluation for D1(fo(g,h)) runs as follows:... This equation is often written simply...<p>Note that f means something different on the two sides of the equation!<p>3 This is presented here without explanation, to give the flavor of the notation. The text gives a full explanation.<p>4 ``It is necessary to use the apparatus of partial derivatives, in which even the notation is ambiguous.'' V.I.

There are ambiguities and inconsistencies, unnecessary redundancies and linguistic inefficiencies. I hardly imagine that anyone commonly steeped in symbolic math thinks that the current system is perfectly ideal, even if they find it generally effective.<p>I find that linear algebra is particularly bad with having too many ways to represent objects and operations, along with many that overlap with algebraic symbols and lead to confusion. It also doesn't help that there are forty billion different ways to represent the derivative of a function, many of which overlap ambiguously with other operations and symbols. I remember having a single semester where multivariate calculus used f' to mean a derivative, modern physics used f' to mean the position of f after a time interval, and linear algebra used f' to mean a matrix transformation of f. There's also no easy way to represent the antiderivative of f other than with F, which looks like f is a vector/scalar and F is a matrix.

It is even better if your IDE can run parts of the compiler on the fly (an instructor once told me that eclipse does this with java. However, I'm not sure if it's feasible for something like C++ due to the complexity of the language).  And then you have all of the other features of the IDE at your fingertips too (e.g. an integrated debugger or profiler).<p>A few years ago I searched high and low for something satisfactory that combines the text editing/navigation of vim with the extremely useful features of an IDE.  The closest thing I could find for C++ was Netbeans combined with the jVi plugin.  The VIM functionality provided by such a setup is not <i>too</i> barebones, and the IDE fills in the gaps where other VIM plugins may have been used.  There may be something better now, but I've grown accustomed to this setup and it takes a substantial amount of time and effort to reroll.<p>There is also Eclipse CDT and the ""eclim"" plugin for it (which actually uses an existing vim process.  Since this means that all of the other vim functionality and vim plugins work in tandem with the IDE, this is the ideal setup), but I recall that there was much lacking with both Eclipse CDT and ""eclim"" itself (I do not recall exactly what, but, again, this was a few years ago).  Things may be different now and I encourage anyone looking for something similar to take a peek at both Netbeans with the jVi plugin and Eclipse CDT with the eclim plugin.",1344722452

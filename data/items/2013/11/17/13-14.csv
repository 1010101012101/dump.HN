I mean he basically called everyone idiots for even <i>thinking</i> that such a thing could be possible.<p>I&#x27;m not saying he accepted to do it. In fact I&#x27;m pretty sure he said no to them. But him acting so &quot;shocked&quot; about the accusation earlier, when he knew that they did ask him to do that, feels pretty disgusting to me.<p>He should&#x27;ve admitted that he was asked to do it, but didn&#x27;t do it. What&#x27;s the worst that could&#x27;ve happened?! It would&#x27;ve just invited more people to take a closer look at the Linux kernel to make sure Linus is telling the truth, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.<p>So even though I doubt he did it, I think much less of him now, for not being truthful to the community, and even attacking the ones who dared to question him about it.",1384696768

The important figures for miners are the btc/usd conversion rate, the network difficulty, your hash rate itself, how much you initially paid for your rig ($/Gh) and how much power you&#x27;re drawing ($/watt). All of these factors are important, but what will dominate over the coming months is power cost. Someone mining a 100 GH/s rig will make 5 times less BTC per day as someone mining a 500 GH/s rig, it&#x27;s true, but if the 500 GH/s is sucking up proportionally more than 5 times the electricity then it can be better to mine with the lower hash rate. If the conversion rate improves that delays the period where electricity costs outweighs the income. For the difficulty to rise another order of magnitude (which would make BFL 60 GH/s Singles worthless), there needs to be about another 30 PH added to the network -- where&#x27;s that coming from in only a month? In any case, people dropping their rigs because they&#x27;re too power hungry may cause the difficulty to go down and make it worthwhile again for some who live in low-electricity-cost areas...

The difference between these groups is crucial to understanding a distinct group of security risks faced by internet connected systems today.<p>4chan has helped drive the discussion of the role of anonymity in online communities.

You cant cherry pick examples to prove your point. To argue that Youtube comments did get worse by supplying a single(10,100,10000) data point(s) is preposterous. One should do a comprehensive scraping of comments for many videos and many countries and many categories, analyze for quality and compare with previous data(without Google+ integration).

If you (and like minded supporters) keep talking about &quot;best practices&quot;, your peers _will_ notice and _will_ start playing with them in their work.<p>At our workplace, we have a monthly hour-long &quot;Lunch and Learn&quot; where we all meet to do three things:  listen to someone share some interesting code they worked on that month (which helps to generate some enthusiasm and spread some knowledge around); talk together about a specific best-practice; collectively review some code with a focus on using that best-practice to improve the code.  It is a very simple, low-cost, low-time-cost way to formalize the fact that you want everyone to pay attention to these things, and (in our case) has really stimulated a desire among the developers to improve their code practice.<p>To implement this, put someone in charge (or take charge yourself :) and just start asking people to contribute.  You will probably find there is a lot more interest in this than you think.<p>Also, be sure to go easy on yourself and your peers as you try to change habits.  If you look back at code you wrote, say, three years ago, you will probably say to yourself, &quot;What was I thinking?  I could write that so much better now.&quot;  In the same way, three years from now you will be able to say, &quot;What was I thinking?

We are talking about a site with user comments that allowed unescaped HTML [1].<p>One of the frustrating things about using Google services is that over the years it has become apparent what a mess the user accounts backend is. There must be a dozen or more different &#x27;types&#x27; of youtube accounts (depending on age, if they opted in or out of various levels of gmail/g+ integration over the years etc), so it&#x27;s no wonder the attempts to consolidate and merge that mess has been so buggy (although I can see why they are desperate to simplify the situation). With the high staff turnover at Google, who at Youtube still remembers the difference between an account that opted to be tied to a gmail account in 2009 and one that didn&#x27;t? (I think at some point that latter became impossible; I seem to remember that I lost access to my oldest YouTube account because I kept refusing to provide email and/or phone number information and in the end they just killed that type of account).<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/07/pranksters-have-a-field-day-with-youtube-injection-flaw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/07/pranksters-have-a...</a>",1384694340

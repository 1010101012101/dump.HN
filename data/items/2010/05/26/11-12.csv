If I didn't recognize the algorithm I might have a very hard time working out exactly how and why that lump of code approximates a square root.  With the words Newton-Raphson included somewhere I could easily look it up and find out everything I need to know about not only how and why it works but also its strength and weaknesses.  Personally whenever I use some non-trivial algorithm I haven't made up I tend to include a comment pointing to the book or paper I got it from so that others can get the canonical description of what the algorithm does.<p>Ideally I'd even like to see a brief comment on why Newton-Raphson was chosen as well.  Is there a good reason why I shouldn't replace that code with some other square root approximation technique or was it chosen because it was the only algorithm the author knew?",1274873366
1380032,comment,1379755,1379927,0,0,Natsu,,,"I've found $seen{$_}++ and similar constructs made out of hashes incredibly useful, but having built-in hashes is itself incredibly useful.<p>For example, when I first heard about them, I didn't understand Markov chains at all.  Then I saw some example code that was only a few lines long and which used hashes to implement them.  In about an hour, I had my own nonsense text generator up and running.  It's not very different, conceptually, from using a hash to remember what you've ""seen""--the only difference is that the hash key is a chunk we've seen, and the hash value contains everything that could possibly come next (and multiple copies of it, so that common text is more likely).<p>And then there's how sorting things can simplify them.  Want to find anagrams?  Inexperienced folks might try to program something that generates every permutation and tests for equality.  That's slow and horrible.  Just sort the letters first and compare.  If they sort to the same string, they're anagrams.  But you don't actually have to sort, you can just turn them into a vector (an array where the first element is the number of As, the second the number of Bs, etc.) and just compare those.  (Incidentally, you can use a letter as an array index in Perl, but I don't recommend it and it generates a warning.)  You can end up turning text processing into Linear Algebra if you go far enough down that road.<p>Perl's map function can do some pretty crazy stuff, too.  For example, the fairly well-known ""Schwartzian transform"" (See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform</a> if you want more information).  Someday, I intend to sit down and play with map until using it comes naturally to me.  I've even programmed some Lisp (AutoLisp, to be exact), but I know that I'm still thinking in procedural terms and I'd like to understand functional programming properly someday, and applying a function to a list of values is pretty much all that you do in functional languages.",1274873148

Jira's interface is a pain to use.  Changing anything about the bug involves loading a new page, and then saving to get back to the original page.  Even worse, the edit page has a completely different layout from the view page, so you have to figure out where everything is twice.<p>Conflict resolution is nonexistent:<p>1. Users A and B click to edit a bug at the same time.\n2. User A changes the assignee and clicks save.\n3. User B changes the priority and clicks save.\n4. User A refreshes the bug page to find that his assignee change has been reverted.<p>This is pretty basic, people.<p>The regular search page is a little odd.  If you have multiple 'projects', and click on one to filter by project, a little DHTML bit pops out that asks you to reload the page to make sure all the other fields are up to date.  Ajax, anyone?<p>The hierarchy is a bit overdone: Projects, then Components, then Component Modules, then Component Sub Modules.

But in the original article, Jeff actually says that <i>that</i> commenting style is also not as good as refactoring the code:<p>""That must be what I was getting at, right? Some sort of pleasant, middle-of-the-road compromise between the two polar extremes of no comments whatsoever and carefully formatted epic poems every second line of code?<p>Not exactly. Rather than add a comment, I'd refactor to this:<p><pre><code>  private double SquareRootApproximation(n) {\n    r = n / 2;\n    while ( abs( r - (n/r) ) > t ) {\n      r = 0.5 * ( r + (n/r) );\n    }\n    return r;\n  }\n  System.out.println( ""r = "" + SquareRootApproximation(r) ); ""</code></pre>",1274871781

How did the twenty-something co-founder of the failed business come to acquire the data? Did outside investors provide funding for the new venture and its acquisition of the data? Were any of those investors also investors in Homejoy? Why weren&#x27;t former Homejoy customers simply informed that another company had acquired their information in an honest, transparent fashion (the way most companies handle transactions of this nature)?<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that the email Cheung sent to former Homejoy customers about FlyMaids stated that FlyMaids &quot;work[s] with Homejoy&#x27;s best cleaners.&quot;<p>If that is true, it would appear this new venture is essentially just Homejoy reincarnated, begging questions about Homejoy&#x27;s liabilities.

It was merely a cold sore in an unusual place until the 1970s. As late as 1975, a study of &quot;Psychological morbidity in a clinic for sexually transmitted disease&quot; does not mention herpes simplex because at that time, no significant morbidity problem (i.e. mental anxiety or illness) was associated with the virus.[98]<p>Pedro Cuatrecasas states, &quot;during the R&D of acyclovir (Zovirax), marketing [department of Burroughs Wellcome] insisted that there were &#x27;no markets&#x27; for this compound. Most had hardly heard of genital herpes...&quot; Thus, marketing the medical condition – separating the &#x27;normal cold sore&#x27; from the &#x27;stigmatized genital infection&#x27; was to become the key to marketing the drug, a process now known as &#x27;disease mongering&#x27;.[99][100]<p>Since the creation of the herpes hype, some people experience negative feelings related to the condition following diagnosis, in particular if they have acquired the genital form of the disease. Feelings can include depression, fear of rejection, feelings of isolation, fear of being found out, and self-destructive feelings.[101] These feelings usually lessen over time. Much of the hysteria and stigma surrounding herpes stems from a media campaign beginning in the late 1970s and peaking in the early 1980s. Multiple articles were worded in fear-mongering and anxiety-provoking terminology, such as the now-ubiquitous &quot;attacks&quot;, &quot;outbreaks&quot;, &quot;victims&quot;, and &quot;sufferers&quot;. At one point, the term &quot;herpetic&quot; even entered the popular lexicon. The articles were published by Reader&#x27;s Digest, U.S. News, and Time magazine, among others. A made-for-TV movie was named Intimate Agony. The peak was when Time magazine had &#x27;Herpes: The New Scarlet Letter&#x27; on the cover in August 1982, forever stigmatizing the word in the public mind.[81] Herpes support groups have been formed in the United States and the UK, providing information about herpes and running message forums and dating websites for sufferers. People with the herpes virus are often hesitant to divulge to other people, including friends and family, that they are infected. This is especially true of new or potential sexual partners whom they consider casual.[102]",1446090383

To me this line of research is raising interesting questions warranting further digging, in a &quot;hm, I wasn&#x27;t expecting that result going by the received wisdom&quot; way.<p>Following the sporadic posts of Type 2 patients in online forums self-reporting success at getting off conventional treatment protocols, what appears to come up in common among them is what is currently considered (by the ADA and similar outfits in other nations) radically aggressive methodology to blood glucose control; <100 mg/dL post-prandial is not considered out of line in that crowd, and they avoid spikes as much as possible. A very small number have been at it for 20+ years and well into their 60-70&#x27;s, and are reporting no long-term disabilities commonly associated with advanced stages of the metabolic disorder. They tend to be in very low (<50 mg/day) carb or even ultra-low (<20 mg/day) carb regimens, or constant ketosis, or varying fasting cycles, with varying amounts of exercise, or a combination of all of the above, with lot of nuances thrown in by each individual. A lot of what they practice directly goes against published large institutional guidelines, but it is really difficult to argue against the end results in their comprehensive blood panels and other bio-markers, so it is a fascinating case to me of the impact of an N=1 / DIY / Quantified Self ethos that increasingly more people are embracing with the aid of increasingly better technology. I find it really exciting that increasingly more laypeople are empirically &quot;science&#x27;ing the shit out of this&quot; (to paraphrase &quot;The Martian&quot;) with a continuous hypothesis-test-adjust loop upon themselves. It is definitely not science by any conventional means, but as haphazard as it is, it is yielding in a startling number of cases exceptionally better results than the average and mean Type 2 patient experience.",1446090319

10469112,comment,10463162,10466496,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,">  A lot of the ideas seem (at least to &quot;regular&quot; folks) to be a bit... strange...<p>I&#x27;ve got the opposite impression really, a lot of the companies are recreating a lot of the old, boring, payments infrastructure and services, but using bitcoin and digital currency rather than building it on old technology like SWIFT, ACH or plastic cards with passwords to money vaults written on them (credit cards) that doesn&#x27;t really work great in a digital age.<p>Things like processing payments online for merchants, things like offering a wallet/vault/bank to store money for consumers, remittances for migrant workers, exchanges to trade different currencies for investors and locking in your price (i.e. if you buy $100 of bitcoin and the price of bitcoin changes, you&#x27;ll always keep $100 of bitcoin because you locked it in. Another boring hedging feature that makes digital currency look more familiar to users because it&#x27;s denominated in their own fiat currency they&#x27;re familiar with even though it&#x27;s built on bitcoin). None of these things are new, many are hundreds of years old, and they&#x27;re the big focus for bitcoin companies and investors. (e.g. Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle, Bitstamp or Kraken Blockchain.info, all have received (tens) of millions in funding, one even topping $100m and they cover the above areas). The idea of using digital currency may be a bit scary to some, but the underlying products and services from the big companies are quite boring at the moment. For example I&#x27;ve ordered pizza a few times with bitcoin, did a bit of trading, donated to charity, bought two games and a bracelet. Ordinary stuff really.<p>Then there&#x27;s indeed Dunvegan Space Systems, but it&#x27;s not a bitcoin company. It&#x27;s a space communications network company by way of satellite, and one of their usecases can be bitcoin, but it can also be SpaceX or wikileaks. The company only has $100k of funding afaik, most of it from the founder itself who paused the project for now. The bitcoin-related product they offer isn&#x27;t a consumer product, it&#x27;s really for companies or even the industry to invest in. How it works is, short and simplified, that bitcoin is decentralised, it works on the basis of many different nodes that all share blockchain data. The issue is that if all nodes, somehow, would be able to get compromised and send out fake data (say because a government controls the internet), that the bitcoin system falls apart. But this is only the case if all nodes are compromised. So as long as even just a single one has honest data, bitcoin can keep working (because you can&#x27;t fake your way around evidence of POW!) That&#x27;s why the notion of having a node in space, in a satellite that broadcasts to everyone and that everyone can pick up on for free, is interesting. It&#x27;s not essential because the chance that all nodes all over the world are compromised at the same time is extremely unlikely, but putting a few nodes in space would make everything that much more secure. The cost per satellite launch is just $1m, so for an industry that&#x27;s worth tens of billions at some point, it makes sense to launch a small fleet for global coverage at all times. That&#x27;s one of the products his company offers, but it&#x27;s really a bitcoin agnostic, satellite communications company. It&#x27;s a really tiny player in the space and mostly a (very cool) pet project by Garzik that&#x27;ll probably become reality if bitcoin is still kicking in like 2020, it&#x27;s not an essential project because most governments look to bitcoin quite favourably, there&#x27;s no real other pressure that can knock out all thousands of different nodes running different software on different hardware behind different routers in different countries. Still it&#x27;d be cool to see happen someday.<p>Anyway, return? No, don&#x27;t count on it. But VCs didn&#x27;t expect that going in, either. Facebook had 5 years of losses before it turned a profit and that&#x27;s a ridiculously successful company. Bitcoin is barely 5 years old, let alone its companies. But some probably do have a decent return already. Take Bitstamp for example, averaged volume of about $150m a month, its fees structure starts at a base of 0.25% which applies to both sides (seller/buyer) of the trade, so on any trade it&#x27;s 0.5%. That puts it at an annual revenue of around $10m. They&#x27;ve traditionally had a small team of less than 10 core people, with probably an equal amount of lower paid in support staff. And they&#x27;re based in Slovenia where a software engineer on $60k is quite above average and support staff are probably around $15k a year. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they&#x27;ve got a team of around 20 people that cost on average say $50k each, or about $1m. Add your office (Slovenia), your servers, outsourcing some work (like pentesting, legal support etc), all kinds of employee benefits etc etc, you can easily imagine they&#x27;re making a few million in profit every year and it&#x27;s not like they had much to invest in. In fact I&#x27;d be surprised if they haven&#x27;t been profitable since day one back in 2011 when they were basically a 2 or 3 man team, they probably were somewhere nearly that small back in 2013 when they had times where they were doing $750m of volume in a month, and that&#x27;s when their base fee was 0.5%, or 1% as it applies to both sides of the trade. $7.5m in revenue in a month and I bet they could count the number of team members on the fingers of their two hands, or maybe even one, for what is purely a software company with a bit of SEPA handling every now and then.<p>Anyway you can run the numbers for various bitcoin companies but most have chosen growth over revenues. Coinbase for example has a massive team, topping 100 people it looks like, all based in SF, they&#x27;re probably burning $15m a year easily on costs, they waive a lot of their merchant&#x27;s fees and have a $75 referral programme if you sign up friends who buy a fraction of a coin. They may not be generating a return (although they do look to have decent revenues), but with $100m in funding and revenues easily topping $10m a year, it makes sense to burn a few million every year to grow. If Coinbase played it careful they&#x27;d have a few million in profit per year, it&#x27;s peanuts for $100m VC investment, they can get triple that in a normal investment portfolio. VCs demand rapid growth and are willing to burn money to get it. But with $1b invested, I doubt we&#x27;ll see much more money flow in this year.",1446089828

The possibility that an HSV-2 vaccine may\nprovide protection against HSV-1 increases its potential value and may\nshift the optimal time for immunization to early childhood, instead of\nthe more problematic adolescent vaccination series.&quot; (My emphasis,\nreferences removed)<p>[ed: to add, I&#x27;m not entirely sure on how/if hsv-1 (the same strain of hsv-1) can &quot;move&quot; -- I recall sex. ed. stating that the most common cause of HSV-1 in the genitals and eyes were self-induced -- but that might have been the other way around (HSV-2 moving from the genitals to the eyes)]",1446089515

Sexual transmission is only incidental, or rather more or less nomenclature, indicating the rough interpersonal proximity required for transmission, and not the specific acts that precipitate transmission.<p>People who spread it won&#x27;t readily display symptoms while contagious. People have it and don&#x27;t realize it. Doctors don&#x27;t even test you for it, unless you specifically ask, since it&#x27;s not life threatening, and most people who would test positive may have had it since infancy.<p>Simplex I is the more common infection, that even your grandma probably has by now. Simplex II is the skeevy version that your cousin picked up in middle school. Technically speaking, it has to do with the tendency for each species to proliferate in different mucous membranes. The differentiation probably has something to do with the way the human body operates the immune system at different levels in different parts of the body, and over millions of years, each species has adapted to colonize one orifice more readily than another.<p>Furthermore, HSV I can show up on the mouth or anywhere else. HSV II can <i>ALSO</i> show up on the mouth or anywhere else. You can have both on the mouth simultaneously or both on your junk simultaneously, or one on your junk and the other on your mouth. Each species of virus has a tendency to reside in one area and transmits from that area more readily than the opposing area, but it&#x27;s really just a liklihood, not hard rules that one only happens here and the other there.

Could publishing health research data in the opposite direction help?<p>Today we hand medical researchers large databases pre-filled with the data they seek.<p>As we move into a world of increasingly ubiquitous biometric monitoring, asymptotically trending towards real-time, could the data gathering be flipped around instead? Individuals become the only ones who own their detailed DNA profile (the profile with billions of base pairs stored), held on either a personal device with suitable encrypted backups (ideal) or held on their behalf by a trusted service (encrypted with a key only the individual holds). Researchers send out requests for specific data (&quot;weekly blood pressure of males between 20-60, with these genetic markers, starting now/5-years-ago&quot;). Individuals either manually approve matching requests or set up approval &quot;subscriptions&quot;/rules. Requests matched with data sources get anonymized data of course.<p>Researchers not only can get data this way, they get a continuous, crowd-sourced data <i>feed</i>. Longitudinal studies might get easier to set up through this kind of channel. There isn&#x27;t a way to ID someone by their feed and the researchers&#x27; requested, limited matching genetic markers alone, unless an attacker systematically breaks into multiple research databases, and starts building a Palantir-like correlation amongst all the hacked databases; that dramatically raises the detection risk to the attacker. Another attack is an overly-broad set of genetic markers in a single request, and those requests can be auto-denied before even getting into the brokering system. Short-term, we can prohibit the collection of any part of the 13-base-pair CODIS markers, though long-term we have to assume that CODIS or its future successors will eventually expand to a larger set of markers (and in the far, far future, possibly the entire sequenced genome).",1446088372

My focus was on civil law systems and I&#x27;m not claiming I&#x27;m the world&#x27;s foremost expert on this topic.<p>With that out of the way, it&#x27;s not that easy. When a company goes bankrupt, it doesn&#x27;t have a say on what happens to its assets. Furthermore, a liquidator doesn&#x27;t have to honor commitments made by the company. (this is also why &#x27;software escrow&#x27; in the cheap form that is implemented so often is, imo, legally on shaky ground - this was the actual topic of my paper).<p>So what are the options? One is to put the &#x27;ownership&#x27; of customer data (what that means exactly is a whole discussion in itself) into a separate company. But that company can&#x27;t be owned by the &#x27;real&#x27; company, it&#x27;s tricky in many way. And costly. And makes things (very) difficult, operationally.

I don&#x27;t think anyone follows through on their claims of being &#x27;careful with customer data&#x27; to this extent, but then again, of course I don&#x27;t know the operations of every company in the world.<p>Basically, once you are in a database of a company, and if that database is worth <i>anything</i>, you are up shit creek when that company goes bust - good intentions and promises do not matter one bit. A new guy comes in who doesn&#x27;t care about his &#x27;reputation&#x27; in the field the company was in, who has a legal duty to get the highest price for any assets, and who is not bound by anything the company did or said.

So you either need to trust the person you&#x27;re intimating with or you need to take precautions, which also don&#x27;t always prevent infection.  Condoms reduce the transmission rate, for example, but don&#x27;t preclude transmission to areas of the body not covered by the condom.",1446087665

The reason is that they use large teams of pro&#x27;s with the best tools often doing <i>full-custom</i> HW development. Full-custom means they&#x27;ll do plenty to improve HDL, RTL, and even wiring of gates they use. Think of Standard Cell as Java web applications with full custom being like delivering a whole platform with a board, firmware, assembler, OS components, and native applications. That&#x27;s maybe illustrative of the differences in skills and complexity.<p>Example of custom design flow\n<a href=""http://viplab.cs.nctu.edu.tw/course/VLSI_SOC2009_Fall/VLSI_Lecture_03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://viplab.cs.nctu.edu.tw/course/VLSI_SOC2009_Fall/VLSI_L...</a><p>Note: Load up this right next to the simple, 90nm MCU PDF I gave you and compare the two. I think that you&#x27;ll easily see the difference in complexity. One you&#x27;ll be able to mostly follow just googling terms and understand a lot of what they&#x27;re doing. You&#x27;re not going to understand the specifics of the full-custom flow at all. Simply too much domain knowledge built into it that combines years of analog and digital design knowledge. Top CPU&#x27;s hit their benchmarks using full-custom for pipelines, caches, etc.<p>Example of verification that goes into making those monstrosities work:<p><a href=""http://fvclasspsu2009q1.pbworks.com/f/Yang-GSTEIntroPSU2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fvclasspsu2009q1.pbworks.com/f/Yang-GSTEIntroPSU2009....</a><p>So, yeah, getting to that level of performance would be really hard work. The good news is that modern processors, esp x86, are lots of baggage that drains performance that we <i>don&#x27;t need</i>. Simpler cores in large numbers with accelerators can be much easier to design and perform much better. Like so:<p><a href=""http://www.cavium.com/OCTEON-III_CN7XXX.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cavium.com/OCTEON-III_CN7XXX.html</a><p>Now, that&#x27;s 28nm for sure. Point remains, though, as Cavium didn&#x27;t have nearly the financial resources of Intel despite their processors smoking them in a shorter amount of time. Adapteva&#x27;s 64-core Epiphany accelerator was likewise created with a few million dollars by pro&#x27;s and careful choice of tooling. So, better architecture can make up for the lack of speed that comes from full-custom.",1446087664

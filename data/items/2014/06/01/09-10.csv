What we call &quot;strategy&quot; is just a set of heuristics that we use to avoid having to do endless calculations. However, a lot of those heuristics are already included in most chess playing software. So, if you&#x27;re weak player as a whole, even if you have some strategy acumen, your contribution in an assisted chess setting will be negligible. The computer will be doing all the work anyway.<p>My rating is around 2000 and I have done some assisted chess playing and I can tell you that it&#x27;s extremely hard to not just take computer&#x27;s suggestion at every move.

7828652,comment,7826976,7828555,2,0,mercer,,,"> Because drugs are illegal it is hard to do research but most peoe are pretty clear that drugs can have a causal effect on mental health problems, even for people who would not have exhibited and mental illness without drug use.<p>From both personal experience and from observing various kinds of drug users close to me , I get the distinct impression that the danger of drugs is often not inherent to the drug itself (as in, &#x27;drug has irreversible effect X&#x27;), but rather more to do with the fact that if you are a regular drug user, you&#x27;re essentially wresting control away from your &#x27;natural&#x27; functions, and taking matters into your own hand. This is just my experience and observation; I&#x27;m perfectly happy to be told that I&#x27;m completely wrong.<p>Regardless of whether you are mentally &#x27;fit&#x27; to begin with or not, taking control of things that normally are managed more, eh, organically carries specific kinds of risks. Especially if it is not entirely clear what these particular &#x27;things&#x27; or bodily functions are.<p>I think this applies to drugs in the broadest sense.<p>Take, for example, someone using sleep medication to fall asleep. If this person gets used to this medication, the first problem is that his body might &#x27;forget&#x27; how to naturally fall asleep.  Even worse, this person might get used to eating a huge meal or drinking a coffee every evening. While &#x27;naturally&#x27; this kind of habit can disrupt sleep, the &#x27;managed sleep&#x27;, through medication, removed this problem.<p>When the person stops using this medication, his first challenge is to give the body time to learn how to fall asleep by itself again. But the bigger challenge is to learn (or even just realize) that he should not eat a big meal or drink coffee late at night.<p>Now with sleep medication you at least have a decent idea of the effects. But if your medication is weed or alcohol (for example), the effects are more varied and unpredictable.<p>I think legalization doesn&#x27;t necessarily &#x27;solve&#x27; the problems that a substance can present, as alcohol is arguably one of the worst drugs one can use. Cigarettes aren&#x27;t that great either.<p>But being able to <i>reason</i> about a substance is crucial. Talking about smoking or drinking, and associated dangers, was a part of my upbringing. Talking about other drugs (MDMA being a popular one over here currently) just didn&#x27;t happen, in large part because they&#x27;re illegal to begin with. If things are illegal, why have a reasonable conversation about it with your kids/students/peers/etc.?",1401615276

52967,comment,52932,52958,0,0,nostrademons,,,"We were in a similar situation in the last YC funding cycle.  5 founders, 3 were not willing to quit their day jobs or move to Boston for the SFP.  It absolutely is a problem - the first thing PG shot back was ""Too many uncommitted founders!"", and we didn't get accepted (or even interviewed).  It'll likely be a problem without YC too: you end up spending more time ensuring that everyone's on the same page than actually building the project.  We sped up noticeably after we dropped from 5 founders to 2.<p>I can't really help find a new cofounder (other than reiterate what others have said: ask around here, check cofoundr.com, etc.), but I can tell you what we did.  We (my surviving cofounder and I) bought out the other 3 founders for $1000 apiece.  In retrospect this was probably too high, given how quickly they accepted.  But it was done mostly to preserve good relations and make sure nobody felt they were being cheated, and I think it succeeded in that.  When our incorporation papers come through there will be a few agreements for them to sign to make sure we own the stuff they did before we bought them out.",1189461271

52961,comment,52926,52926,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"There is one important one you left out: Flash Lite. Its somewhere between web and an on-deck app, since it runs on top of a very small on-deck virtual machine. <p>The UI for the LG Prada is built entirely on it, and in an interview with an iPhone dev at Apple, it was confirmed that the iPhone will soon support Flash too (I lost the damn link though). It allows for rich interfaces and doesnt necessitate the installation of an on-deck application since it is loaded from the browser.<p>I agree with your notes on Java ME... Sun really didnt have a choice though in the early days, if they were to gain adoption by the handset manufacturers. They had to allow lots of flexibility across implementations. The good news is that modern Java ME phones usually support a wide range of libraries and the manufacturers are much better about being compliant. ",1189460028

52959,comment,52932,52932,0,0,nreece,,,"Before you, your cofounder and your team came together to work on the startup, did you ""communicate"" to your cofounder and/or team that you might/will consider moving to a different city if the need arises? Did you guys talk through any such possibility if the startup looks promising in the future? If not, then do you think its justifiable to only hold them accountable for not agreeing to move with you?<p>Teams are made up of people, not ideas alone. They may have families and other responsibilities which might be more important to them. So if you think that they do not share your vision, then try and talk to each one of them individually and understand what's holding them back. And if its really not going to work out, then be polite and express them clearly that you care about the future of this startup a great deal, and you will have to find a team member who shares your vision. But be humble, and stay humble. Nobody likes a cranky selfish boss. Good luck!",1189459596
52958,comment,52932,52950,0,0,wammin,,,"Yep, I agree with your advice and I also read PG's recent article that you referenced. Totally agree.<p>I have talked with the team, and we seem to all understand that this is not going the way we want. I have made it clear that I will be looking for others to join in a ""co-founder"" capacity if I get the opportunity to go to YC this winter. They are reasonable people and good friends, so I don't think it will be a big problem to do a little equity restructuring if its in the best interest of the startup.<p>My real question is not ""am I screwed?"" because I already know that. I'm asking ""how can I fix this now?"" or, in other words ""please help me find a new co-founder and a chance to get into YC (or another good startuppy environment).""",1189459596

52953,comment,51351,52244,0,0,Goladus,,,"I'm mostly trying to figure out what the essential qualities of Perl are such that you consider it more lisplike than any other language.  I have in fact been trying to avoid making value judgments about either language (though I have complained about Perl in the past, and I understand the original author makes some absurd criticisms).<p>So:  I have specified a few things that, to me, seem remarkably different from Lisp.  In some cases, such features are more cumbersome or less flexible.  In others, such as the reserved characters, there is no clear winner.  <p>That Common Lisp has few if any reserved characters gives me lots of freedom to change how my program looks.  In my example above, I could remap 'funcall' to '&' and the result would look almost just like Perl.  It means, though, that I have to be really careful not to do anything stupid lest my program be unreadable.  Perl, in contrast, has built-in meanings for all sorts of punctuation.  This often saves a lot of typing, and allows many ideas to be expressed succinctly without any extraneous configuration  So Lisp is more flexible in a sense, but it's not immediately clear that this makes Lisp more powerful.  <p>What I'm interested in, is how much <i>different</i> it is to program in lisp as compared to perl.  The symbols thing seems minor in principle.  But in practice, when coding in Lisp I find this flexibility leads to a completely different way of thinking.  It's way too early for me to say whether one is better than the other, but the difference is remarkable.<p><i>merely syntax</i><p>Perl is full of syntax.  There's syntax for everything, personally I think it's one of Perl's strengths.  Lisp, in contrast, (usually) has very little syntax.  It's orthogonal and consistent.  (limited and static, if you'd prefer more negative connotations)<p>Some people do better memorizing huge number of details, others do better learning core rules and applying them to each case.  In my first year of music theory, my professor took the ""few core rules, consistently applied"" approach to teaching voice-leading and almost everyone hated it.  The first day of class next semester, my new professor handed out a voice-leading review sheet that was, front-and-back, covered with rules about what to do in a given context.  Most people seemed to prefer it that way.",1189458923

Co-founder has an equal stake as currently, but we have a prearranged agreement where I will be entitled to more equity upon our first financing. I don't really want to throw them out ... they are good at what they do (just not doing enough, in my opinion).

52950,comment,52932,52932,0,0,breck,,,"The truth is you can't succeed with that type of a team.
Read PG's article ""How Not to Die"". A great quote is:<p>""The number one thing not to do is other things. If you find yourself saying a sentence that ends with ""but we're going to keep working on the startup,"" you are in big trouble. Bob's going to grad school, but we're going to keep working on the startup. We're moving back to Minnesota, but we're going to keep working on the startup. We're taking on some consulting projects, but we're going to keep working on the startup. You may as well just translate these to ""we're giving up on the startup, but we're not willing to admit that to ourselves,"" because that's what it means most of the time.""<p>I've run into similar situations before. This is a serious problem and one you should deal with immediately, because it will only get worse. Have an honest, tough talk with your team. It sounds like you won't convince them to put it all on the line like you have, but at least you'll know and you can make an arrangement so that you're moving forward with the company and not having this looming over your head. If worse comes to worst, tell them you are going to move on because its sounds like you are pretty talented and there are many opportunities for someone like you.<p>Good luck.",1189458160

Remember you're working full time on the project that means you're investing $x (your full time job's salary) every month as opposed to the other guys. From your description the other two guys seems to be playing safe, not risk takers (very much required ingredient for startups)<p>I think you really need to find new team members who are committed, dedicated, and risk takers.<p>As far as finding new team members, I think it would be nice to work with people who you know already to reduce time consumed building a new relationship. Otherwise, you got to work with people for some time to find workable team members.<p>Best of luck",1189458118

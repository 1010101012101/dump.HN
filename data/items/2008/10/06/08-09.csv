I wish something like Ruby in Steel was available for OS X and Linux.  I know there are eclipse and netbeans IDEs.  They really suck.  Other small players don't build a nice product either; I've tried them all.<p>I would pay money for a solid OS X and/or linux based graphic debugger and ""Smalltalk-style"" code browser for ruby.",1223282993

324711,comment,324684,324684,0,0,jhancock,,,"Scalability is a way of asking “how do you engineer something well?”. If you’re a software engineer with enough experience, the answer is that making something scalable has no silver bullet. You just “write good software”. So what does that mean?<p>In part, it means encapsulating your design and code at a mid to low level of granularity. If you are strict with encapsulation techniques (following pure OO and message passing design is a solid method) it doesn’t matter what languages or libraries or databases you use in each part as you simply rewrite/replace components as they become bottlenecks.<p>This approach allows you to get a full system bootstrapped without need to optimize components ahead of time.<p>The whole point of a web service is that you have a simple API and others don’t care about how you implement internals. So taking an API-centric design approach is key.  This approach is not new to the fact that we call the API a ""web service"" these days.  The same tried and true software engineering methods are called for.<p>If you don't like the above answer and want a more concrete answer on how to make something scalable, then just study erlang ;).",1223282495

324705,comment,324502,324502,0,0,dzorz,,,"> If my mom does a search for something, or if I do a search for something, Google treats us exactly the same.  My mom loves crafts, and I love software development.  We should get completely different results.<p>This is actually not true. Different users <i>do</i> get different results, not only based on whether they are searching using their local google site or e.g. google.com, but also based on their search history.<p>For example, when I searched for GAC (I'm signed in with my google account), the first result I got was:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Assembly_Cache"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Assembly_Cache</a>",1223280567

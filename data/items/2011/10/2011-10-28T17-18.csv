If the field becomes more balanced, that will come down towards 50%.<p>Even if men in the field individually keep acting the same, that's almost a 50% reduction in the amount of sexism a woman will experience, because she's interacting with fewer men and more women.  We tend to notice offensive things by counting them, not by figuring out expected values based on sample sizes, so things would appear to improve, even though the men will not have changed their behavior at all.<p>The real WTF odd fact is that as the field tips towards 50/50 women, the amount of sexism that (non-sexist) men will observe will actually go up, because a higher proportion of the interactions they observe will be male/female (whereas with a highly tilted sex ratio, they usually mainly see male/male conversations taking place).<p>IMO the <i>real</i> problem with the lopsided male/female ratio in tech is that women experience almost double the harassment they would if it was 50/50, so they think things are much worse than ""average"", and meanwhile men witness a much smaller amount (almost 3:1), so they think things are better.<p>Then both sides clash, and argue about whether there's a problem or not, relative to other industries. Based on their observations, both men an women could probably be forgiven for jumping to the conclusions that they do; unfortunately, I haven't seen any sort of actual numbers that might help pin down whether men in tech are actually worse, better, or the same as men in other fields.  That women experience more harassment does not necessarily mean individual men are more likely to harass.",1319823800

The decoder runs much faster in nightly, due to JS engine improvements that landed over the last few months, and are not yet in stable.<p>> Still not sure how this is meant to actually be useful though. The problem with H.264 isn't availability of implementations, it's being non-free and heavily patented.<p>First thing, this at least gives you another option. That is, if we get this codec to run as fast as a native one, then we now have the choice of either the browser <i></i>or<i></i> the video website providing the decoder (and properly licensing the decoder, if they are in a country that has pure software patents). More options are never a bad thing.<p>But I think the real potential in this approach is something entirely different. The opportunity is that <i></i>you can download arbitrary decoders<i></i>. So instead of the current world we live in, where you have a few decoders installed, you can have custom ones for different websites. Imagine a website that has cartoon videos or anime etc. - in principle, they could use a custom codec that is heavily optimized for that kind of content, as opposed to being forced to use stock decoders.<p>Also, it prevents being frozen in time: If you can download decoders from the web, you can improve them constantly while making sure your users have the proper decoder (since you ship it to them yourself), which you can't do if you rely on stock preinstalled decoders.",1319822933

The people here care (obviously, hence this debate) about this issue and I just wanted the definitions to be set right: jailbreaking != ownership.<p>As to why it's good or bad, that's entirely personal preference.

There is a lot more needed to understand which areas of the help center aren't getting enough prominence, which topics are just missing, and also how we could create some automated tools to help people find sources of problems. For example, if you are over quota, we should tell you that prominently on /help. Getting automated feedback on search results (clicks on help articles increasing their rank for a given query), and also from ticket responses (the article which would have answered the question needs higher rank for the original query) is a huge area of potential improvement, but both require a fair amount of work.<p>The potential impact is actually huge: would we need to double the size of the support team if we double the userbase (yet again)?

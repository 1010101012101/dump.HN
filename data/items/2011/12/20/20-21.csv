They can't simply add new reserved words to the language because it will break preexisting code (c.f. all the old C headers with idenfiers like ""bool"" or ""class"" or ""virtual"" that don't build in C++).  The underscore-followed-by-capital convention happened to have been reserved by ISO C90, so that's what they picked.<p>But they allow that this is ugly, so there's a new C1X header file you can include in new C1X code that makes the identifiers look like you expect they should.  Obviously old code won't include this header and is insulated from the change.  (I guess if you wanted to nit here, having a separate header for each new feature seems dumb to me.  Why not a single <c1x.h> or the like?)<p>Compatibility is important, especially for languages like C with <i>staggeringly large</i> bases of mature code.

Once you understand that, and see that it is this kind of mind that has contributed a lot to the culture of Lisp, you begin to see why Lisp is, like many of its proponents, a brilliant failure.  It shares the peculiar strengths and weaknesses of the brilliant bipolar mind (BBM).<p>Why is this?  Well, its partly to do with vision.   The 'vision thing' as George Bush Snr. once described it, is really one of the strengths of the BBM.  He can see far; further than in fact his strength allows him to travel.

Neither is true.<p>Google isn't ""funding"" Mozilla; it's a customer of Mozilla.  Their search traffic payments aren't charity or venture capital; they are revenue.  Search engines are always willing to pay for large amounts of traffic.  Even Opera reports significant revenue from their desktop browser [1][2], which has an order of magnitude fewer users than Firefox. This is not the first time the Google/Mozilla deal has been renewed in the past decade, and I doubt it will be the last.  And there are other search engines who will also continue to pay for valuable traffic.<p>(Note that individual donations are still important for the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, since tax rules limit how Firefox revenue can be used for the Foundation's other activities.

I wanted to look into this corporation/foundation distinction to see how much money Mozilla gets from Google.  Some highlights from Mozilla's <i>2010</i> financial report (2011 isn't out):<p><a href=""http://static.mozilla.com/moco/en-US/pdf/Mozilla%20Foundation%20and%20Subsidiaries%202010%20Audited%20Financial%20Statement.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.mozilla.com/moco/en-US/pdf/Mozilla%20Foundatio...</a><p>1) Mozilla doesn't live off our contributions, not by a long shot: Mozilla only had collected 150k in contributions throughout 2010 and expected at most 1.7 million total (there is a discrepancy in time between when the report is prepared and when donors may actually send the check they promised).<p>2) Mozilla received 121 million from ""royalty revenue"" -- anything related to the Mozilla brand: Amazon affiliate programs, search engine branding like this Google deal, and sale of products from the Mozilla shop.<p>3) According to note 9 (footnotes are always where all juicy info is buried), 84% of the royalty revenue from 2010 is from ""a contract with a search engine provider for royalties which expires November 2011.""  I take that to mean the Google contract.  84% of 121 million is ~100 million.<p>4) Mozilla's burn rate was 62 million, which means Google paid for the entire Mozilla development effort in 2010.  Interestingly Mozilla's burn rate increased 50% from 2009.  I can speculate this is from the increased competition from Chrome, but who knows.<p>5) Mozilla held 105 million -- yes million -- in investments in 2010 (mostly bonds and index funds, check out note 3).  Without Google, Mozilla can use this war chest to operate for at least 2 years.  That's much, much better than most companies.<p>6) Last, as a side note: there was a re-org in early 2011 (which I had missed) where Mozilla seems to have folded the thunderbird effort in with the browser team.  This could be a ""synergy"" move, but it likely means they are divesting from that business and putting more people on the browser effort.",1324413560

It simply couldn't happen for political reasons (without knowing a thing about the internals of the working group, I'm fairly confident of that). In the meantime it is still useful to define <i>some</i> uniform cross-platform API, even if most organizations continue to use pthreads in legacy code.<p>Assuming ""too dangerous"" wasn't a direct quote: stack size is an implementation detail, something they probably intentionally left undefined. There are good reasons for this, not least baking assumptions about the underlying machine into the standard has never been a goal. Secondly, with advances like Go's dynamic stacks and its <5 assembly instruction overhead, why would you go and bake a feature akin to a modern sbrk(2) in when sexy alternatives that might see wider adoption are already seeing deployment.<p>As for timed sleeps, providing absolute timestamps rather than intervals is important because it prevents drift: given any function manipulating time, or some timeout, calculating some perceptible end time in the function prologue is much more immune to stupid developers introducing drift (via loops), than expecting the average Joe to account for the latency/contention introduced by system calls, the scheduler, power management, etc.<p>Fears regarding ntpd causing sudden jumps aren't well-founded (ntpd adjusts time very slowly, in sub-second intervals), although the general argument is fair (the sys admin, or other crazy external sources, can cause large time jumps).",1324413406

I am severely myopic and have always preferred a black background.<p>However, last week I had cataract surgery and now with a +27.5D (!!) IOL implant in my right eye - the only eye I have, I'm not so nearsighted as I used to be (20/80 now instead of 20/200), but I am still experiencing eye strain when looking at the computer for any length of time. After switching my editor to a white background, things got a lot easier to see.<p>Mind you, I am only a few days post-surgery and I haven't yet gotten new glasses. I was also having a lot of issues with colorblindness and contrast sensitivity, as well as a lot of ""double"" vision (which was more accurately ""I see 8 of those things"" vision). These are now resolved, as well. All of those will factor into the equation a great deal, I'm sure, but I do find that after the cataract surgery, the light background makes for less eye strain.<p>I switched color schemes from ""Blackboard"" to ""Dawn"" but my Blackboard theme may have been modified a bit.

My team has tried and failed to be a team of generalists in an environment that is very silo'd with a lot of politics and a lot of undirected and uncontrolled customers. Experts counter-intuitively are better to have than generalists in this situation, because experts would have to collaborate and communicate to get the job done; in a team of generalists where each works in a silo, no one has reason to talk with each other unless forced, and this is dangerous if one were to leave, as there would be little familiarity with the application they developed by the rest of the team.<p>But, on the other hand, this post was about startups. In a startup, it makes more sense to hire good generalists, or to hire someone that is good at one thing, but learns the others.

3374934,comment,3372503,3373621,8,0,guns,,,"> The NK brand of communism is just a thin veil for the old dynastic feudal caste society that Korea traditionally was.<p>While your argument is defensible, I think characterizing the NK autocracy as a natural progression of pre-occupation Korea is misleading and perhaps unfair.<p>It's important to remember that at the time of the NK invasion in 1950, Korea had only recently been freed from the 35-year Japanese occupation in which the Japanese actively sought to eradicate Korean culture. The successor to this was another occupation by the US and USSR.<p>Although the new interim governments were more benign I don't think it was clear that the future would hold any kind of true independence from foreign states, and certainly US style democracy seemed quite far fetched.<p>And so it seems to me that if I was a young man of fighting age in Korea in 1950 (and thus born during the occupation), I would have found the NK motto of ""Juche"" (self-reliance) much more compelling than the murky, foreign roadmap offered by the US. Indeed, the professor in this article, Kim Hyun Sik, expresses this sentiment.<p>Even for many years after the Korean War, it wasn't clear that the US-led South was superior in ideals or in practice. The industry-heavy North (aided by infrastructure built by the Japanese and by Soviet engineers) flew ahead of the South in terms of economic growth and actual standards of living. Meanwhile, South Korea was embroiled in poverty, military coups, and cruel suppressions of student riots. You really couldn't have called SK a democracy until the late 1980s.<p>Of course, fortunes changed for NK. The classic Soviet style N-year plans were failing to meet their quotas, and as this began to happen, Kim Il Sung, who was really a foreign plant from Stalin, began to emulate Stalin's tactics of self-aggrandizement and brutal extermination of opponents.<p>If you wished at this point to question why it was that nobody stood up to Kim Il Sung in his rise as tyrant, you could very well blame Korean Confucianism and the hierarchical nature of Korean language and society. This is a strong reason, but I don't think it's sufficient.<p>There is a simpler answer: NK is a very tiny nation, with a reluctant ally on one border and a perpetual enemy on the other. Total control in a country of NK's size is actually possible, and with a constant menacing enemy, it was relatively easy to manipulate a small society into subservience. Think ""1984"", or the ""War on Terror"", but constrained to the state of Indiana.",1324412042

Drill down to a suitable depth, even if it seems silly --- if you're assuming the customer will have 110 volt AC power, consider saying so.<p>* Keep the customer informed --- no one likes surprises.<p>* Make a habit of sending short, just-the-facts-ma'am email summaries confirming oral discussions --- they can be incredibly useful in the event of later finger-pointing and ""why didn't you tell me X?"" accusations.<p>*  In the same vein, seriously consider never deleting any email to or from a customer or otherwise relating to a job.<p>* Consider treating development of the specification as a separate, separately-priced deliverable.<p>* Consider providing an ""extension of time budget"" in the contract --- that is, you've got X days of extension budget that you can allocate to individual deadlines as you see fit, with a max extension of Y days for any single deadline.<p>* Watch out for IP-ownership provisions; try to make sure you get the right to continue using general knowledge, tools, non-customer-specific code, etc., for other projects.<p>* Be extremely careful using FOSS (free / open-source) software --- the customer will be really PO'd if it has to release the source code to its product.  Microsoft had to do that a couple of years ago because one of its consultants included GPL code; see this blog posting [1] by Silicon Valley lawyer Mark Radcliffe for details.<p>* In the contract, try very hard to (1) exclude consequential damages, and (2) limit your liability to X or 2X or even 3X, where X is the amount you're paid.  If the customer balks, you can respond that you're selling services, not business insurance, and that uncapped liability will have to carry a higher price.<p>* Investigate whether you can get professional-liability insurance (errors & omissions or ""E&O"").  If so, try to have a separate cap for your contract liability in the amount of your coverage --- that is, your liability won't exceed 2X, where X is the amount you were paid, or your policy limits, whichever is less.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lawandlifesiliconvalley.com/blog/?p=306"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lawandlifesiliconvalley.com/blog/?p=306</a>",1324411940

Given the limited market and limited market info for patent values and the unpredictability of enforcement results, this litigation seems to participants as reasonable a method as any for determining the cross licensing value if you're not going to just put everything in a pool (which certainly is supposed to work better, except when Samsung or Nokia sues over the very patents they put into the pool).<p>Most forget that Apple spent 20 years of R&D on personal mobile devices, then moved into phones in a way that made it obvious the rest of the industry was stagnantly producing what the carriers wanted instead of what humans would really use.<p>As Apple's ""Jesus phone"" swallowed demographic segments whole, raking in the lion's share not of units shipped but of profits, the mobile industry went nuts at seeing the lucre they'd left on the table and started suing Apple from every side, both directly and through intermediaries.  Of course, Apple, with its 20 years of actually innovative R&D in the space, countered.<p>When some of the industry start playing the ""fast follow"" game instead, Apple is forced by trade law to defend against that or they de facto give up their rights to the undefended points.<p>The charger and cable design show this wasn't a happy design coincidence; this was a calculated move to establish a ""me too"" product line. Part of that calculation was ""What will be our expense from design and patent assertions by Apple when we fast follow these products so closely?""<p>Before Apple got into mobile, this was how the business was done, but it wasn't in the press because nobody was interested.

This substantially decreases the likelihood of the filesystem ending up in an irrecoverably inconsistent state, but it also has major performance implications.<p>Relatively early on ext3 was extended with ""data=ordered"" and ""data=writeback"" modes (with ""data=ordered"" being the default and recommended mode, as ""data=writeback"" is marginally faster but offers few consistency guarantees). In these modes only metadata changes are committed to the journal.<p>In ""data=ordered"" mode the filesystem attempts to guarantee that data will actually be written to the disk (not merely cached) before any related metadata writes occur, as opposed to caching and writing all data according to an outside schedule. Obviously, this also has certain implications for write performance.<p>I would say that Firefox was incontrovertibly broken in this case, but my views on the adoption of ext4 would probably be considered rather conservative.

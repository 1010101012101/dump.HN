It's actually P(your state undecided) x P(nation undecided without your state) x (Value of your candidate winning - Value of other candidate winning).<p>For example, say your state has 10 million voters and the election is a statistical dead heat (i.e., each voter has a probability of p=0.5 for voting for candidate A vs B). Then P(your state undecided without your vote) = (5 million choose 10 million) x pow(2^-10 million) ~= 1/(sqrt(2 pi) 2.5 million) = 1.6e-7.<p>And that's assuming the best case where your state's voters could go either way. The probabilities become exponentially smaller (literally: exp(-n^2)) if your state actually has political leanings.<p>I'm also not sure how we could even approach a $6 trillion gap under plausible assumptions. Does anyone really believe that the gap between each candidate is $6 trillion (note: total economy is $15B) or $20k/person?",1352206525

When you're showing <i>one value</i>, and at most might have targets to show in relation to it, a radial chart is just as good IMHO, and lets you put other info in the centre (like the figure in numerals for example). The closest tabular representation would be the weekly stats at the bottom.<p>I think they make a nice compliment to the other graphs on the page, and do not sacrifice usability for aesthetic appeal given that there are other styles of chart used where appropriate (for example the time series of visits etc.).",1352206262

Going from red to green can be deeply satisfying for reasons I don't fully understand. RSpec has a nice HTML output for ruby.<p>Use a visual code coverage tool - Having 80% or 90% code coverage is a useless statistic, but having a tool that shows you what part of the code is being tested and what isn't is extremely useful. If nothing else it tells you where you need to add tests or what part of your code is hard/impossible to test. I like SimpleCov for ruby.",1352205971

There's documentation for the format on the adobe site, I think (wherever it came from at the time - autumn 2007 - no fax was required), so it was actually fairly straightforward. An artist made me a bunch of PSD files with the stuff in that they wanted to use, and I sat there comparing the results of my code to what Photoshop did.<p>The only oddity I can recall is that Photoshop does something odd with the alpha channel - I think it was the alpha channel? - by sometimes storing it with the summary image rather than the layer to which it's related. (Don't ask me for more details than that - I don't remember.) I thought at the time that this looked like somebody's attempt to make newer data work tolerably with older revisions. That part WAS annoying, because the documentation didn't mention that, and it took about a week before somebody managed to create a photoshop file that was arranged this way.<p>The file format overall bore many of the hallmarks of one that had grown rather than being planned, but it looks like they'd started to clamp down on things at some point because the newer data chunks looked a lot better-designed than the old ones.

I believe that for the most part this is warranted, because despite the in Vivo or on paper promise of a technology, in the biological sciences it often takes about 10 iterations to make it safe and efficacious in Vivo, and this translatory delay allows this to happen. Not ideal, but IMHO better than an alternative that puts lives at risk.<p>I just don't see how we can circumvent RCTs as the burden of proof for efficacy and safety. Probably, yes, we could slash a lot of fat from the FDA, and trim a lot of processes... But do away with it entirely?<p>I would be interested to hear what your alternatives are",1352205132

Or at least most of one and a good amount of the other.<p>I have become a generalist at a company that definitely has distinct frontend and backend teams. I started as backend dev but started doing frontend work too. I have found myself in great demand due to my unique role at the company.<p>Since I know a lot about the entire tech stack, I can act as a routing agent for product managers and other non-developers. They ask me questions, and I can give them a pretty good answer. If they need something done, I can refer them to the specialist who wrote the code that needs changed.<p>When I am coding small tasks, I can write both sides of an API much faster than it would take two devs to negotiate the requirements. Communication is a time sink. Rather than writing emails or tasks requests, I can just write code and be done. There is a threshold though where it is better to split the work. There is only so much I can hold in my head at once. But even then, I find I am better at communicating because I know how both sides work.<p>Does the project have a nasty bug that needs tracking down? The generalist can lead an investigation the whole stack, asking specialists when needed. Last week I solved what our CTO referred to as ""the ninja bug"" that had plagued another team for months. The root problem was on the frontend (ios client), and I pushed an instant fix by updating our server code to compensate.<p>Lastly, some companies have skunkworks projects with very small teams. Being able to own both sides of a task means fewer people required to do it. I have become the goto guy for whipping up prototypes. I typically work directly with our CEO to create a proof of concept as fast and cheap as possible. When things look promising, we bring on more specialized devs and I lead the project.<p>You may not want to be exactly 50/50, but definitely be aware of how the other side lives.

Voting for president is one of the most cost-effective actions any patriotic American can take.""<p>Slightly longer version: ""The value of not voting is that you save an hour of your time. The value of voting is the probability that your vote will decide the election (1 in 10 million if you live in a swing state) times the cost difference (potentially $6 trillion). That means the expected value of your vote is $600,000.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://norvig.com/election-faq-2012.html#rational"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/election-faq-2012.html#rational</a>",1352203290

As Winston Churchill said, ""Many forms of Government have been tried and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.""<p>AFTER EDIT: Today's news includes an analysis of why voter turnout in the United States is only around 60 percent of persons eligible to be voters,<p><a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/why-40-americans-wont-vote-president-231957289.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.yahoo.com/why-40-americans-wont-vote-president-2...</a><p>a lower percentage than in some other democratic republics.<p>Thanks for the first comment received below this one, which points out that local elections can matter for voters as well as the presidential election.

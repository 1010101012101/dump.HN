I've become an engineer because I <i>create</i> things: every day something starts spinning, cranking, rotating and pumping because I build it, while 100% of lawyers (without exceptions) are useless parasites eating off our own deficiencies.<p>Having an average engineering job isn't lame, your (and Greenspun's) line of thinking <i>IS</i> lame. In fact, it's pretty disgusting. That also explains why there aren't many women in the field: generalizing, they're simply more bottom-line oriented, as numerous studies have proven: they don't spend 6 years to get a Master's and build robots in a garage in their spare time for free, instead they'll ""wipe ass"" overtime in a nearest hospital with an associate degree, because overtime pays double rate.",1211269412

194807,comment,194142,194478,0,0,curiousgeorge,,,"The reason there are line-ups in the short-term is rarely because of the pricing mechanism, but because the degree of control required for effective rationing requires fewer points of distribution. If you could vote at the convenience store, you wouldn't need to line up to vote either....<p>The supply and demand argument isn't tenable in areas with both inelastic supply and demand. The possible solutions all involve tradeoffs, and there are good and bad ways to implement them.  The good news is that rationing doesn't necessarily require price controls, and there are effective and ineffective ways of sending price signals and otherwise encouraging/discouraging production.<p>My personal preference is subsidization for the poor - an approach which prices scarcity by trading cash for convenience. Telling the starving that a big of hunger is good for them in the long-run is silly.  A bit like arguing the Great Depression was nothing more than a purge of rottenness from the system. When all the banks have collapsed we'll all be better off!",1211268428

Again they're succeeding by not playing their own game.<p>(I find it strange that so many people devote energy to thinking about what the numbers <i>don't</i> mean rather than thinking about what they <i>do</i> mean.)",1211267174

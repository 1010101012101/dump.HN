A lot of people don't read/watch the news anymore and if they do, they usually watch it on one channel at night. I find it rare for people to do something as simple as use google news or other aggregators. And even if you were to read  multiple papers, the Times does get reprinted a lot, so does Reuters and AP, Knight Rider stories etc. The newspaper industry is about as consolidated as the search business. There not that many conglomerates in news and independent newspapers are rare.",1279321190

That means you have to have special endorsements or licensing to hold those positions. My wifes district is laying off teachers this year due to budget shortfalls yet there are still job openings. They are just all special education positions.<p>There are two reasons there's lots of special education positions open. The first is that many teachers don't have the necessary endorsements. The second is that many teachers have zero desire to get the endorsements. Special education in many schools is underfunded and under supported. In our overzealous attempt to prevent peoples children from being labeled as different we've hamstrung the programs. Then you have the mainstreaming of severely dysfunctional children in order to make them feel normal. This can cause greater problems for those children and negatively impact the education of every child. I'm not an expert on this topic but I've heard enough about it to see why so many teachers aren't willing to work in special education.",1279320453

1522846,comment,1522218,1522542,0,0,ktsmith,,,"Sounds like your wifes district is severely dysfunctional. My wife is also a teacher and her experiences aren't like this. There are bad teachers that are still around because of tenure but I've yet to hear of anything as extreme as sleeping in class. That's not to say it doesn't happen, just that every district has different problems.<p>Administration vs teachers. This can vary school by school from what I've seen/experienced. At the school my wife just finished four years at staff parties were staff parties, even administrators came. The teachers and administrators had close bonds and when half the staff and 100% of the administration at the school were fucked due to district level bureaucracy and the requirements of a federal grant this year there was very clear solidarity between the two groups. The principal that will be taking over the school for the next year however immediately alienated all of the staff members and replaced a bunch of them with people from his previous school. The mans reputation preceded him of course and it wasn't a good one, regardless of his reputation his actions were very discouraging and in many cases poor judgement.<p>As far as tracks for progression and salary for teachers I don't think a traditional corporate structure would work just as it doesn't often work for engineers or programmers. I know plenty of programmers that never ever want to enter management and struggle to find companies that will pay them according to their experience and not their position on an org chart. Additionally with teachers many teachers, my wife for example, there may be zero desire to become an administrator. As such we should be willing to pay teachers that are good, and have experience accordingly regardless of their moves into administration.<p>This may not be the case where you are located, but here the teachers union represents the teachers who have one type of contract, and there is no body that represents the administrators. Administrators have individual contracts and can be terminated quite easily by the district. Teachers are on standardized contracts created by the teachers union and so it is harder to remove them. Unfortunately you don't see many administrators removed because there's a good old boy system in place. The people at the district level overseeing administration all know each other and have been around forever. People owe each other favors or their kids play ball together and other bull shit. A new superintendent was hired a year ago from another state and the first thing he did was eliminate a lot of positions that were filled by unqualified individuals or that shouldn't have even existed. Some times a little fresh blood at the top is necessary to clear out administrative problems. I don't envy him though, he'll probably be tossed out on his ass in another year or two due to problems beyond his control. The school districts budget shortfall for next year is over 50%.",1279320208

Everybody would be willing to mate with everybody at all times; whereas humans only want to mate with people they're attracted to.<p>The mere fact that men care whether their sex partners are good-looking tells us that pair bonding is pretty deeply ingrained in our psyches. While females have a stronger incentive to make sure the men they mate with are of the highest quality (since they could be stuck carrying and caring for their kid for a long time), men invest little in mating so in the absence of pair bonding should be willing to mate with <i>any</i> female unless they expect to find a better female in the next few hours. Instead, men tend to be picky about the physical characteristics of the women they're willing to mate with.<p>I think the conclusion of The Red Queen on this subject was that humans are somewhere between monogamous and polygamous; men are polygamous when they can get away with it (i.e. when they're powerful enough to get away with taking more than their fair share of women) and monogamous when they can't. Women have little desire to have multiple husbands, but do want to mate with the best quality men, so will often marry lower-quality men but have affairs with higher-quality ones.<p>Strict monogamy no, but pair bonding as a deep-seated instict yes.",1279319785

I was always a tomboy and hated dolls, I was far more interested in cars and planes and Lego than more girly toys (though when peer pressure started to become a part of my life I felt left out without Barbies and things).<p>The point being, at my academically-selective girls high school, we had only a tiny computer room (and not much done in there), no metalwork or woodwork or anything like that classes, but lots of sewing and cooking as our ""design and technology"" part. Us girls weren't really encouraged to use computers much, the only thing that really got me into it was my dad, who was (and still is) an oldskool computer nerd. I'm sure if we'd had more opportunities to do more with computing there would have been more women going into computer-related degrees at university, for example.

The subject of the article in question was the author of at least half a dozen highly influential books in his field, the subject of a biography published by a mainstream publisher, cited in publications by his peers probably hundreds if not thousands of times over the past thirty years, interviewed and quoted in mainstream media around the world etc etc etc. Unfortunately there was a clique of editors who didn't like his ideas. Essentially they thought he was a quack and therefore couldn't stand the idea that he'd be given exposure in Wikipedia. I have no opinion on whether he's a quack and it really has nothing whatsoever to do with his notability. Eventually I was able to establish that the guy is influential and the article is still there, but the stupidity of having to endlessly argue the point made me say to hell with it and I haven't edited anything since.",1279318360

2. Adding all these into Google reader takes me 20-25 minutes or so.  It's annoying.
3. Once I add them in, Google reader starts filling itself up with all their posts.
4. Suddenly I'm faced with two things:<p><pre><code>   a. A rapidly growing number of unread posts I'm supposed to deal with.
   b. A generic, plain, boring interface in which Gizmodo articles, Slate articles, NYTimes articles....all look exactly the same, as if they'd been published by...Google.

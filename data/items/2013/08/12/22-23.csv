It was decided downtown San Jose, Fresno, and Bakersfield must have stations. (This requires an additional long tunnel, and urban construction is much more expensive.) The route takes a detour through Palmdale[1], an underdeveloped part of Los Angeles County.<p>The &#x27;straight shot&#x27; route down I-5 that Musk proposes was also considered for HSR, and rejected even though it would have been much cheaper and simpler to construct.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cahsrblog.com/2013/06/the-truth-about-tejon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cahsrblog.com/2013/06/the-truth-about-tejon/</a>",1376348316

Tips are supposed to be--by definition--voluntary, and in some sense a reward for service.

6202736,comment,6201179,6201179,22,0,strlen,,,"I attended a talk at CUFP (Commercial Users of Functional Programming) by a compiler team at Intel on why they were using SML (which -- like caml -- not lazy by default and allows I/O and mutability without having to isolate them ala IO and St Monads) and the comments were quite interesting: many graph algorithms are best expressed in a mutable fashion and he saw no fundamental advantage of simulating mutable state via recursion/CPS (for algorithms that primarily used mutable state) and actual mutability; it wasn&#x27;t a performance based argument -- the compiler still outputs extremely efficient (obviously) imperative assembly code, but the additional complexity.<p>Obviously the functional parts of the language still applied with primarily functional algorithms, like parse-tree traversal and transformation, which is an excellent example of monads being useful and handy outside of pure and lazy language.<p>Note that the author also notes two significant problems that have nothing to do with functional programming or purity per-se:<p>1) Calling language-x from Python/Ruby/whatever is difficult unless language-x is C/C++. I fully agree here. At one employer we&#x27;ve built custom bindings from Perl to OCaml (for a DSL we&#x27;ve built) and it was troublesome (e.g., it was broken during 64-bit conversion and our patch fixing it was not initially accepted, although the Nria team later came up with the same approach -- which involved &quot;burning&quot; a register -- later anyway).<p>This is less of a problem for large scale distributed applications that talk via RPC, but this create a problem of building and re-building first-class RPC libraries in each language -- which (as in this very example!) is again best done by building the core RPC protocol implementation in C/C++ and linking it into the applications (with perhaps a native JVM implementation as JNI is a pile of manure? [Personal curiosity: with Google having a huge Java presence, how does Google handle maintaining up-to-date Java clients for BigTable/Spanner et al?]).<p>2) Lack of OO.<p>OCaml has OO but it&#x27;s never used. OCaml has a marvelous module system that is far better than Haskell&#x27;s. Unfortunately it lacks type classes (hence -- very annoyingly -- no generic &quot;print&quot;/&quot;show&quot; function), but first class modules and campl4 (equivalent of template Haskell) can help there. I am guessing that it doesn&#x27;t solve the author&#x27;s problem (which I honestly can&#x27;t claim I have, but that is like my opinion, man) -- lack of dynamic dispatch.<p>Problem is inheritance based dynamic-dispatch polymorphism and generic polymorphism are hard to reconcile. I am very impressed by the work Odersky has done with Scala as well as C++11 (and boost/tr1 before it), but these are by no means simple languages (by simple I don&#x27;t mean simple like Visual Basic, I mean simple as in &quot;implementing a compiler for it is feasible in an advance undergraduate or beginner graduate class&quot;).<p>When I write golang, Haskell, Erlang, or OCaml I honestly don&#x27;t miss OOP as modules, interfaces/signatures, type classes, and the like provide what I want out of OOP. However, I&#x27;ve never maintained (as opposed to wrote) commercial code in these languages.<p>tl;dr That&#x27;s all folks, I&#x27;m now switching to an emacs window to write more C++ code -- while (as a big FP enthusiast) hoping practices for programming-in-the-large would emerge for non-OO statically typed functional languages (from places like Basho, Galois, and Jane Street who have built impressive multi-year projects in those languages), OCaml gets multi-core support, and Scala succeeds in its mission.",1376348069

Also, planes don&#x27;t fly at 150,000 feet (the pressure equivalent in the tube) and there may be other biological hazards other than breathing.

6202568,comment,6196811,6201260,1,0,Tichy,,,"Thanks - I am actually not that interested in the variability hypothesis, as I would expect other factors to be much more important. So I guess I won&#x27;t spend the time to read the paper in detail. The summary mentions that variability seems to be the lowest in countries with the most gender equality. That doesn&#x27;t seem to contradict the notion that some inequality is caused by variability - after all, you could read it the other way round, where there is high variability, it leads to gender disparity.<p>I&#x27;ve come to jokingly say that a bad maths teacher at primary school could be worth millions of $ in damage compensation. It must be the primary school maths teacher fault that you didn&#x27;t make a high earning STEM career, right? Except of course nowhere in society is math talent really supported, most math talents are mostly on their own (just my impression, though).<p>To me differences in incentives seem likely to have a much higher effect. It doesn&#x27;t pay off for women to take risks, or not nearly as much as for men. Women have biological value in their own right (reproduction machinery), whereas men are much more expendable. To get ahead, men have to take higher risks - nobody will care for an average man. And men can gain extreme advantages in reproduction by taking risks and winning (even fathering thousands of kids like Ghengis Khan).<p>On the other hand consider that for a woman planning on becoming a housewife with no special skills is actually a viable strategy. Few feminists will consider that because they are biased by their own preferences, but if only a fraction of women take the &quot;easy&quot; route, it will show in things like pay gaps and percentages of women in certain types of jobs. (Btw I don&#x27;t think any of the pay gap studies take into account that women typically get half of their husbands income - I assume that is also the case in the US?). For example that recent hype of &quot;we need more women in action movies&quot; is complete nonsense, because women simply don&#x27;t have the incentive to put themselves into risky situations where they might be shot to death. Yes, there are exceptions, but on average there will simply be fewer women who will do that. So demanding that 50% of action heroes should be women is simply bullshit. It&#x27;s not role models that makes women not clamor to get themselves killed, it is simply that they have no need to do so (apparently even the women joining the army are exposed to much less risk because they get different jobs than men).<p>As for the plethora of feminist movements, does that mean one can&#x27;t criticize feminism? I don&#x27;t think so. Most of them seem to have in common that they blame men for suppressing women. I know that some acknowledge that the &quot;patriarchy&quot; hurts men, too (although how prominently it features in their campaigns is another matter). It is still an ideology of victims.<p>The crazy thing to me is that feminists don&#x27;t just get it a little bit wrong (in my opinion) - in many cases they get it 180 wrong, exactly the opposite of what they believe is true.<p>Examples: women are not pressured into becoming housewives (as feminists believe), they have the privilege of having the option to become housewives - try to plan on becoming a stay at home dad? (This is actually one of the points where feminists believe they also help men, but they overlook that they simply have the higher biologically claim to be stay at home, because they invest so much energy into child bearing. I don&#x27;t expect a huge shift towards stay-at-home daddying).<p>Or rape culture: our culture does not condone rape, as feminists believe, it actually sees rape as an especially horrible crime. Therefore it is given proportionally more attention than other crimes - men are much more likely to be attacked on the street, but the disproportionate rape scare makes us feel as if women are more endangered. Also every movie or book uses rape as an easy way to evoke emotions (because it hits us especially hard), adding further to the distorted conception of the prevalence of rape. Scantily clad women in advertising are of course weird, but they don&#x27;t signal women are readily available everywhere - they signal that you have to work a lot, get rich and buy a fancy car to attract women. Quite the opposite - if men would really believe that women were readily available without them having to show economic viability, they&#x27;d stop working and the economy would go to ruins immediately.\nAnd so on, and so on...",1376346163

Also, from building social network clones(for $200) to building proper webapps for well known startups and companies like Compete, Hubspot.<p>* Sign up for all freelancer Marketplaces: Elance, Odesk, Guru, Freelancer, RentACoder.<p>* Sign up for RSS feeds for jobs(full time/freelance) in your domain.<p>* Start bidding, sending out emails to all of the above that apply.<p>* You&#x27;re bidding against devs from 3rd world countries(so you will have to price somewhere in the median atleast until you get your first decent folio piece done)<p>* Also it doesn&#x27;t matter if your request doesn&#x27;t exactly apply. Don&#x27;t be self-selective. Also even if you don&#x27;t expect to get that job, apply still. Get your name out.<p>* Be very communicative, friendly and more open than a simple &#x27;Here&#x27;s my folio&#x27; etc. You&#x27;re trying to sell yourself, so figure out what the client want, customize your pitch. This part will take a bit of hit and trial on your end to figure out how to get the first client reply. If your post looks like others, then you won&#x27;t get one.<p>* Work on the side on your own project, something that&#x27;s production worthy and you can showcase if the above steps haven&#x27;t worked till then.<p>* Reply to posts on HN, Ask HN like Who&#x27;s hiring + Who&#x27;s hiring a freelancer. Even add yourself to HN contractor list and anything similar you see elswhere.<p>* Market, Market, Market every chance you get. I used to spend atleast 3-4 hrs initially just sifting through job posts, replying, emailing everyday.<p>* Remember to raise your prices sooner than you think.<p>* Recently i&#x27;ve been trying out Google adwords, which haven&#x27;t really led to a lot of hits. But i&#x27;ve been getting like 1 really good query for like 100 clicks. For the average amount i make per invoice, that ad costs are very minor even at the ridiculous CPCs to hit the front page.<p>* A lot of people mention word-of-mouth here. This is really the best way. For every satisfied client you&#x27;re essentially expanding your network exponentially and getting in touch with people you would never have come across. But initially since you might not have a portfolio, it will be difficult to get work this way. Also until you&#x27;re able to price your work higher than average, you won&#x27;t get the right kind of clients. And without the right clients you won&#x27;t get paid higher. So it&#x27;s a vicious cycle you need to get out of by piling up showcase work as soon as possible.<p>* With lower rates it will be difficult to sustain work, since you would have to take on more work before the current one is over. Hence your focus suffers and work quality too. So you&#x27;re hampering your prices, word-of-mouth network further if you take on work and underdeliver. I&#x27;ve been guilty of doing this(probably still am).<p>* So as soon as you get too much work to handle, double your rates.<p>PS: I&#x27;m one of the third world dev that people on HN are very fond of :-)",1376345764

I see no fundamental reason to assume that the hyperloop is lighter than the train. It could be so, but then, we could make smaller and lighter trains, too (light rail).<p><i>Plus you don&#x27;t get the same natural banking off the walls he talks about, which is relevant at these speeds.

The solution is known: tilt-trains. The track is banked such that the train will not fall over if it has to stop on the curve. The passenger cabin then tilts with respect to the wheels so that it always feels like the floor is &quot;down&quot; regardless of the speed that the train goes around the curve.

This is my middle-of-the-road estimation of the danger, nestled between the unlikely extremes of &quot;100% selfless heroes guarding us while we sleep&quot; and &quot;shadow government quietly pulling the strings of the world&quot;.<p>In other words, I&#x27;m much more nervous about &quot;Brazil&quot; than &quot;1984&quot;.<p>See also: <a href=""http://omniorthogonal.blogspot.com/2013/02/hostile-ai-youre-soaking-in-it.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omniorthogonal.blogspot.com/2013/02/hostile-ai-youre-...</a><p>> If the citizenry didn&#x27;t like what the representatives were doing, they&#x27;d elect different ones.<p>We&#x27;re working on that.",1376345033

6202414,comment,6201728,6201728,47,0,blackjack48,,,"Location is a primary reason why Musk can claim Hyperloop will be cheaper than high speed rail. As the paper correctly points out, right-of-way acquisition is very expensive. Bypassing major population centers is an easy way out of using eminent domain or expensive tunneling to build the system. The HSR project is required by Proposition 1A to pass through several population centers in the state and have a couple dozen stops. Notably, Hyperloop proposes to bypass all of the SF peninsula, San Jose, and Central Valley cities like Fresno and Bakersfield. HSR was politically viable because these regions were included in the project. Furthermore, the route and station map appears to hint that Hyperloop&#x27;s stations are positioned away from city centers. For example, the &quot;San Francisco&quot; station appears to be located in the East Bay and the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; station is closer to Burbank. This is quite significant from an urban planning perspective as it means that short haul transit or car trips have to be accommodated for a majority of those people who want to use the system. It also adds to the total travel time needed to get from door to door for a greater number of people than does HSR.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that Hyperloop is an inherently flawed project or that HSR is the perfect solution to the state&#x27;s long-haul transportation needs. I just think that Musk is oversimplifying the situation.",1376345010

This is because they will be able to market it as a dietary supplement, something which the FDA will not be able to ban (they're guessing anyway).<p>The FDA are currently in court with 2 e-cig distributors because they decided suddenly to the joy of various associates of the pharmaceutical industry to classify all e-cigs as drug delivery devices (even though no medical claims were made by the two in question - the largest distributors of e-cigs in America) and confiscated their shipments.

Sounds a bit passive for a ""notification"" :)<p>The problem with legalese is that it never really tells a normal person anything. It's an impenetrable wall of text which no one wants to read, but <i>possibly</i> should, in case it contains some outrageous evil to which you'd end up agreeing.<p>That's why I want to avoid it when I get my own stuff out there. Since I'm not planning to do anything evil, I don't need to distract & confuse anyone with legalese.<p>And since I don't live in the US, I don't have to use legalese to cover my ass from ridiculous lawsuits either :p",1250560830

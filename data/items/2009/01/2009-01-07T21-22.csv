No passing the buck to your employer, and no ""just following orders"" Nuremburg excuses.<p>- Engineering advice you give, on duty or off, just like doctors and lawyers, unless otherwise indicated, are legal engineering advice, and you can be held accountable for its consequences. E.g. Advising your neighbor that'd he'd need a 5"" support column for his deck, and if you're wrong, he can sue you for damages.<p>The difference is that non-software engineering is routinely life-or-death, and there are enough considerations in your average engineering task that you really don't want someone who hasn't been comprehensively educated doing the job.",1231365483

424016,comment,423490,424004,0,0,abstractbill,,,"Right.  Ars, here are a couple of points you may be missing:<p>- Adding threads ""works"" up to some small number (maybe a few hundred or so - depends on your platform).  Then adding more threads just takes up more cpu without doing any useful work.  Your program can <i>seem</i> cpu-bound, when actually you just have so many threads that none of them can do anything.<p>- The approach axod and I are talking about uses a single thread to service many network connections.  Obviously you have to write your code quite differently to handle this:  Your code is typically ""triggered"" by an event like receiving a few bytes over one network connection.  You do a (very!) small amount of work, and then you quickly return control to the network core (called the ""reactor"" in Python's Twisted library).  The core then waits for another event (e.g. more bytes arrive on a different network connection), and the cycle repeats.<p>Hope that helps.",1231364931

XUL just isn't remotely competitive unless your app looks like a web app, in which case, it probably should be a web app. The range where you need something that looks like a web app but isn't one, and absolutely positively won't ever need any of the extra functionality the other toolkits offer (all of which is there for a reason) is a pretty narrow one.<p>Between bindings and scriptability built into some of the toolkits such as QT, there's almost nothing left unique to the XUL platform.

The difference I see in the comments to this article, and a number of other comments that touch on this, is how resigned people are to that fate. I am not yet, and it doesn't appear that you are either.<p>The more resigned someone is, the less reasonable being frustrated about broken philosophy or practice seems to be. The solution then becomes either forcing oneself to become numb, or finding some other outlet for the frustration that doesn't solve the problem. I don't think either of these are particularly effective. They've tended in my experience and those of the people around me to become positive feedback loops; bottling or channeling it just doesn't do enough, it comes back and often with greater intensity. In an odd way, it strikes me as being passive-aggressive with oneself.<p>Frustration is a sign that something is wrong, and, although it is out of fashion to do so when politically imprudent, I'm an advocate of dealing with the root cause. If something is frustrating you, either change it, or become an advocate for change if it requires more than just your effort. Just advocating for the change can be a frustration reliever; you aren't constantly trying to expend energy forcing yourself to be ok with something anymore.<p>As for the letter, depending on the response, take it as a sign of whether you'd want to work at that organization. I'm undecided on whether you should've sent it; it depends on your goals. If you were just looking for whatever company would hire you, the letter was a mistake. If you're looking for people who are on the lookout for people with ideas and desire to share them, it might not be such a suicidal move. Just imagining myself as a hiring manager, if you had good points, it certainly wouldn't hurt your chances.",1231363812

MySQL was fast, but wrong.  Now it is fast and correct. Most of the reasoning behind picking one or the other has disappeared and we're left scraping the bottom of the nitpick barrel trying to convince people to use one over the other.<p>As for why someone would choose MySQL, there are a bunch of reasons.  There are a lot more people with MySQL experience out there.  MySQL has better replication facilities (and I've set up replication with MySQL, Slony-I and PgPool-II).  I'd really like to see Mammoth Replicator become the standard in the PostgreSQL community (as well as for 1.8 to be out of beta) as I think it's a considerably better replication design than the other options in PostgreSQL, but right now MySQL replication looks a lot better.  Maybe you have a good use for one of MySQL's less used storage engines.  MySQL Cluster looks interesting, but I wouldn't trust my data to it today (even if Zillow seems to think it's the best thing since sliced bread).<p>The differences between the two are really minor today.  Choose whichever one you like, but there are definite reasons to choose either one.",1231363013

I'm starting a project soon and want the following functionality in the software that we use:<p>I want it to (a) track bug issues, (b) track milestones and a roadmap, (c) allow us to upload code to keep track of each of our changes to the code, and (d) give us a (login-restricted) wiki and/or forum so we can document the discussions/ideas we have.<p>I'll take a look at Trac in more detail later tonight, but if anybody knows off the top of your head if Trac (or some other software) does the things I mentioned above, let me know!",1231362934

Its the sweat that needs to go into building something that is a real business that is the difficult part.  I agree that you might think that people would want to clone it, but cloning something alone does not guarantee any kind of success. There are hundreds of examples of sites that do very well, where other people have tried to emulate them only to fail. Personally I put it down to a lack of passion on the cloners - its not really their 'baby'. They've not agonized over what to create, how to create it and this probably makes (part of) the difference between success and failure.<p>Personally I often find it inspiring when people do discuss how much their startup makes. Inspiring on the ""I could do it too"" scale and sometimes there are good lessons in these stories - not so much this one I would hasten to admit!",1231362235

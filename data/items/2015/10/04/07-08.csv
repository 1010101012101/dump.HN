My personal intuition is that by using a compile-to-JS + Node, you lose performance (Node.js is good for I/O, but not great for anything CPU-bound), plus combining Node.js and compile-to-JS is not too easy, if the compiler is not designed specifically for it (typically if it&#x27;s not CPS-based).<p>In addition, if you intend to use static typing on generated JS, I suspect that you are going to lose plenty of information.",1443945451

As such it has a discontinuous shape.<p>The main element I would critique is in the culture. Culture in 2015 will feel old and dated by 2030 - our memes, our artisan craft breweries and hip indie games. Something else will overtake them. Culture has the soft power to change people&#x27;s perception of reality even as the substance of that reality remains more stagnant. And culture isn&#x27;t directly associated to a new tech so much as it is the proliferation of that tech.<p>For example: &quot;Drone&quot; today equates to big war machines dropping bombs. &quot;Drone&quot; tomorrow could mean the kid across the street with a new toy and the ensuing shenanigans inflicted on stodgy 50-year-olds who think you&#x27;re going to blow everything up.",1443945164

At the start and up until the Blitz, both sides wished to avoid civilian casualties (incredible idea). Even the Nazis wanted to just take out the RAF, docks and munitions factories. But then some bombs landing in Berlin gave Hitler the idea to start terrorising British cities, so London&#x27;s docks became a target in expectation that a lot of ordnance would miss and terrorise Londoners. Whitehall was also targeted - a &#x27;decapitation strike&#x27; in modern parlance.<p>Coventry was removed from the map in summer 1940, to a certain extent Churchill had been waiting for this to happen (Bletchley Park had thee intercepts) so that reprisals could begin. And so it began. Bomber command kind of gave up on &#x27;precision&#x27; and it then became eugenics - kill off the working class people! Bomb their houses! Factories, docks, railways were no longer the targets, it really was working class housing to be terrorised.<p>I have not heard about Churchill&#x27;s advisor - Lindemann - on any History Channel documentaries, but not everything is as it gets told. I am not seeking a contrary view, just, the more you study a subject doing one&#x27;s own research the more it differs from our own rosy propaganda. I also think that what the germans did in Namibia before the war is also quite fascinating, the depths of inhumanity that we learned of after the concentration camps were discovered were plain to see a generation earlier. It is as if the germans missed out on colonies and sought to make colonies in eastern Europe to make up for missing out on the land grab that the British (Portuguese, French and Spanish) empires had managed.<p>As for the Buckingham Palace incident, that was a stray bomb, not one of many aimed at the palace that happened to get through.",1443944556

Recursive queries are needed for specific use cases. Even then, querying from the app, like you said, and/or building materialized views and materialized paths are very good ways of working around this, as long as the query is anticipated in advance and the view/path built before the query. So that reduces the real use of graph db&#x27;s to an even smaller subset - complex ad hoc graph queries.",1443943405

10326764,comment,10316872,10316872,0,0,joshberkus,,,"I&#x27;ve done this a few times.  First, see the list of PostgreSQL-based extensions and tools listed by other folks below; they&#x27;re all good things to look at before you implement something from scratch. Regardless, this is probably a good approach if you are using Postgres anyway and just need a graph for part of your application.<p>For short graph traversals, recursive queries and joins perform surprisingly well, even when compared against dedicated graph databases -- at least, the open source ones I&#x27;ve been able to try, including neo4j.  The ones I&#x27;ve tried perform better than Postgres mostly when you get more than two hops away -- but then at least Neo and the MySQL thing tend to suffer if the data set doesn&#x27;t fit in memory.<p>I had at least one project which reverted from a dedicated graph database to Postgres specifically because it needed decent on-disk performance (2TB per shard).<p>Anyway, to your question: you could build a PostgreSQL database like that, but why would you?  If you have distinct types of entities (person vs. furniture vs. town), why would you denormalize them into generic node interitance?  Having a completely abstracted database with one big table called &quot;things&quot; and another big table called &quot;relationships&quot; seems really attractive before you actually do it.  Then it starts to suck.<p>Relational databases are designed to perform well, and to be easy to query, with &quot;normalized&quot; databases in which different types of entities are represented by different tables and relationships are defined by foreign keys.  The further you get away from that model, the harder the database gets to use.<p>This is one of the problems with using graph concepts for questions which are not, fundamentally, graphs.  Yes, you can define people&#x27;s nationality as a graph from location to nation, but that makes it pretty hard to do voter registration stats.  Graphs are a great tool for answering many important questions, but they are not a great tool for answering <i>all</i> questions.<p>Now, if you are answering an actual graphing question (i.e. show me everyone who shares something in common with me via at least two links within 3 hops), then proceed.  But figure out what kinds of questions you specifically want to answer before you get too far.",1443942756

Full screen top page images are only viewed once and mostly show nearly immediately on any decent connection, and are already several times larger than a web font or two used to style entire web sites. Full screen video is far worse in terms of bandwidth without user consent. And if you&#x27;re on a shopping site or any site with photos, a web font is practically one photo. It is not that expensive at all.<p>We must not also forget that web fonts have replaced text graphics. They can be small, but when used on every header or with multiple states in interfaces, they added up quickly. Not only are web fonts lighter, they are real text. We don&#x27;t want to revert to text graphics.<p>What we have is the designer on one end, and the user on the other. The designer wants to decide how the page is served. The user wants to choose how they consume the page. Some users may add salt and pepper, or remove all the tomatoes. Giving users power cannot be a bad thing. But do we want features that automatically change our food no matter where we go? And there may be some allergic to everything. Maybe they&#x27;ll turn off JS and not load any images, and be okay with half the sites being broken. But they will always be a minority that other&#x27;s shouldn&#x27;t be too concerned about. And they will always do whatever they want.<p>To know if a web font is ugly requires tasting it first, so at that point, you&#x27;ve already paid for what you may have tried to save. But considering how little weight web fonts are and how important they can be as part of what is being expressed by the composer of a page, ignoring it would be like randomly removing an ingredient deemed important by the chef.<p>Why risk those great sites for the one&#x27;s that suck? Why would we allow the worst food to dictate all of our meals? Shouldn&#x27;t we just call out bad web sites for what they are, instead of crippling our hard earned technology?<p>Imagine iOS 9 with Arial. Fonts are important.",1443942177

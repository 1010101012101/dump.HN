Any heavy twill that remains unwashed for long periods of time (as all &quot;selvedge purists&quot; seem to do) will last longer than a pair of cheap jeans that get tumble-dryed twice a week.<p>Please stop perpetrating this myth that selvedge denim is somehow inherently stronger or better than regular denim. It should be indicative that most people need to turn the cuff of a pair of selvedge jeans to look for the actual selvedge before they know for certain.<p>To your original point that you find it confusing that apparel is expensive relative to other goods, it&#x27;s probably because retail margins are disproportionate to the amount of cost it takes to sell garments for a list of reasons out of the scope of a Hacker News comment. Apparel is, at the point of sale out the door of a manufacturer, cheaper than it has probably ever been today. The amount of processes involved between planting a cotton seed and loading a container of packed garments is absolutely awe-inspiring in scope, and the fact that a pair of jeans is billed by a manufacturer at ~>$10 is crazy.",1422172577

His clients were happy to pay him the 70 dollars he charged for the operation and also tipped him most of the time. As time went by and his experience increased he got to a point where he was fixing the door locks in 10 or 15 minutes with virtually no disturbances for the customers. His tips started to fade off and his customers became outraged at his 70$ charged for those 10 mins of work.<p>Conclusion: we don&#x27;t want to pay related to the value we receive for a certain service, but to the amount of effort involved in the delivery of that service.",1422172357

In the real world, the lone programmer doesn&#x27;t get to write an efficient program for different reasons: the software design is locked down by managers, there is fear of abandoning the poorly written legacy code, newer programming tools aren&#x27;t allowed because most developers don&#x27;t know them, or there is a sunk cost of an expensive software license that has already been purchased.<p>The story is symbolic, but the lessons are universally true, even today.

8942354,comment,8941891,8941891,0,0,jeanlescure,,,"Right off the bat, with honesty based on what I have lived through already, people who are smart and experienced enough to offer mentorship usually find &quot;pupils&quot; who have already reached a certain level on their own. So trying to surround yourself with &quot;the right people&quot; before gaining enough experience to offer insightful feedback to your peers is truly like expecting a venture capitalist to invest in your business when you possess no real business plan to maximize their return over investment.<p>With that said, keep yourself efficiently informed. Read quick bits of information to maintain a broad image of what&#x27;s trending in the fields you are interested in. Twitter, Quora, LinkedIn articles are all great places to get just enough to keep yourself up-to-date.<p>Find what makes you truly passionate. At any given time there will be 20 or 30 emerging technologies which will claim and convince many that they&#x27;re the next big thing. So instead of trying to bloat-up your resume with every trendy set of acronyms you can find, focus on the few that really resonate with your programming personality. This will increase the quality of the learning you are able to squeeze between (or even during) office hours.<p>In that same line of thought, keep your peers, and especially your superiors, in the loop of what makes you passionate. Once you find the next big thing which interests you, make a presentation and share the knowledge. This will not only guarantee that you&#x27;ll place yourself in a spot where opportunities will multiply to work with the tools you like best, but, to make sure you&#x27;re truly prepared for thorough questioning, it&#x27;ll also force you to truly sharpen your knowledge and go that extra mile when digging through the docs and teaching yourself.",1422172145

Of course, just doing this I will eventually run out of money, but if I am sufficiently rich, I don&#x27;t see why I couldn&#x27;t affect the price.<p>Similarly, if I had a lot of Ampercoin, couldn&#x27;t I sell it for &1/$0.10 ? As long as I was doing this, it would not make sense to buy it at a higher price. If there was always another entity willing to pay $1/&1 , then I suppose that might always keep the value of it at least one dollar? (and people could use that to get all my money)<p>This is not to say that I don&#x27;t think a fixed exchange rate is achievable, just to say that I don&#x27;t think a &quot;its fixed at $1 because everyone knows its supposed to be fixed at $1&quot; is stable against malicious attackers.<p>So of course, you are probably using some other method.<p>3)&quot;Addresses come preloaded with 10 Ampercoins each.&quot;
How does this work? Where do these &10 (supposedly worth $10) come from?
Looking at /lee it says &quot;Anonymous sent &10.00 to &lee 10 days ago&quot;
I assume this is an initial transaction which is made when the account is made, after the user sends a number of bitcoins to an address in order to buy the account.<p>This makes me skeptical of the security. How do those Ampercoins get there? It doesn&#x27;t look like its meant to be proof of burn (if it is, that could be made more clear). If you have access to these bitcoins, and these bitcoins are all that are necessary to create an address with some coins, it seems like you would be able to give yourself very large amounts of Ampercoin. This is of course assuming that the bitcoin transaction are even necessary for the Ampercoins to be created, and that you aren&#x27;t able to create however many accounts you want each with &10 (i.e. this is assuming that you are not trying to create a system where you have the ability to essentially print Ampercoins whenever you want, and where Ampercoins have a value of $1.)<p>In conclusion:
I am skeptical that this is secure.<p>edit: I feel that perhaps I have been overly aggressive in this comment. I suppose I should add that if you have accomplished what you say you have accomplished (or if you accomplish what you are setting out to accomplish), then that is(/would be/will be) quite impressive, and congratulations (in advance)",1422170692

The company at which I work (it&#x27;s a large social network that recruiters love) has a couple of small teams which have released or are working on apps written entirely in Swift. So it&#x27;s definitely usable.<p>Good reasons to use Swift might include the following:<p>- You think you can make good use of the features Swift offers (generics, sum types, optionals, namespaces, typed containers) and are willing to not just write Objective-C code with a different syntax.<p>- You are willing to take a short-term productivity hit to learn a language which will probably become the crux of Apple&#x27;s developer tools in the future.<p>- Your project isn&#x27;t going to rely heavily on the dynamic features Objective-C offers (e.g. method swizzling, adding or replacing classes and methods at runtime).<p>Things that are troublesome with Swift include the following:<p>- Swift&#x27;s interoperability with Objective-C and Cocoa Touch is still touch-and-go in a lot of places. It&#x27;s been getting better, but unless you understand how both Cocoa Touch and Swift work, you will just have to take on faith things like IBOutlets being implicitly unwrapped optionals.<p>- Xcode&#x27;s stability when it comes to working with Swift projects leaves much to be desired. The level of instability also seems to vary; I&#x27;ve worked on files that crashed SourceKit over and over and files that caused the IDE no trouble at all.<p>- I wouldn&#x27;t call Swift alpha-quality, but there are still compiler and runtime bugs that need to be addressed.<p>(BTW I really wish HN supported proper lists in comments.

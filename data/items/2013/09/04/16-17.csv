In that sense, Joel&#x27;s advice still holds, if you think of &quot;rewrite&quot; less as &quot;throwing out your own code and starting over&quot; as &quot;throwing out memcache and writing your own caching layer/throwing out Postgres and writing your own database/etc.&quot; Which is a temptation that lots of startups fall victim to, rarely with a happy ending.",1378313882

For your kids to live in the world of the future and interact with others, they will need an identity, it is unavoidable unless they want to live off-the-grid in bush country.<p>We can see grade school and high school pictures of famous celebrities because pictures were taken with analog film cameras once. We can see old baby pictures of people who are 65 years old today because photography has existed for over a century.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re not taking pictures of your daughter, but someone else will, and they can tag her with metadata for their own purposes.<p>I don&#x27;t post my kids pictures publicly (I do to close friends), not for hyperbolic fears that someone might profile them and show them a targeted ad (The Horrors!), but because honesty, I&#x27;ve seen enough weirdos doing stuff with people&#x27;s pictures online that I don&#x27;t want them showing up on some jackass&#x27;s website, especially ones people fap off to. Especially true for young girls, as there are people who steal portraits from other sites and they end up in spammy popup ads or worse.<p>But even that is a losing battle, as again, photos are taken everywhere by everyone. As the cost of cameras goes to zero, they will be omnipresent, and as networking becomes more and more ubiquitous, a world where you are always being filmed and classified is inevitable.

My two favorites are part of the subway system.<p>One of them is just this impressively massive railway arch going over the end of the N-line.  It&#x27;s kind of like the five-layer interchanges on highways.  You&#x27;ve got a normal city street, and above it, an elevated subway line, and above <i>it</i> a freight train tracks going cross-ways.  It&#x27;s like one of those multi-layered highway interchanges, but you can just walk right in and see it up close at 0 mph.<p>The other one is something similar at I think the Smith & 9th street stop in Brooklyn.  You&#x27;ve got a canal, with a drawbridge that lifts straight up to let ships through.  And then above THAT is a subway station.  You&#x27;re standing on this subway platform, and it looks completely normal, like any other platform in the city.  And then you look behind you and you&#x27;re five stories up or so.<p>They&#x27;re impressive engineering feats, and also a little bit extravagant.  They could have moved the pieces around quite easily to avoid building such large and expensive and difficult structures, but for whatever reason (bureaucracy? union graft? the architect was a little cracked? because fuck you, that&#x27;s why?) they decided to go out of their way and build something which would be a wonder if it weren&#x27;t so mundane.",1378313731

As someone else mentioned earlier, the NFL already has a system in place for all players to get free rides at any time, no questions asked (plus a legion of fans who would bend over backwards to drive an NFL player home). I think this could be an improvement with regards to the UX and ease of use for the players, but this still may not be enough to solve the main problem.<p>Edit: if we want to get more in-depth as to why this might not fix the problem, look at the kind of people who become NFL players.

6328604,comment,6326861,6328353,2,0,n00b101,,,"> This is a good article, but I think it leaves out an important option, which is &quot;do nothing.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t see how &quot;do nothing&quot; is a good option. If the co-linearity between two variables is high enough, then the linear regression equation will not have a solution at all. But this is an edge case. The more common problem with co-linearity is that it leads to unstable regression parameters. For example, all variables in a dataset could have very high, positive correlation, but one of the regression parameters could come out as a negative number due to co-linearity (which would counter-intuitive). If you are basing decisions on the regression parameters then it could lead to some very silly decisions. Moreover, if you resample the data and re-fit the regression model, you could get very different regression parameters (i.e. the parameters will be unstable). Stability of the parameters over time (or over different training sets) is one of the most important properties of a good model.<p>To see why &quot;do nothing&quot; is not a logical option, you can imagine that your data points are plotted within a 3-dimensional cube (1 response variable, and 2 predictor variables). If the data is co-linear, then your data points will lie along a straight line that cuts across the diagonal of the cube. If you &quot;do nothing,&quot; then it is directly equivalent to trying to fit a PLANE through a LINE in 3 dimensions. The problem is that points along a LINE do not uniquely identify a plane. The slope along one axis of the plane will be stable, but the slope along the other axis will be fitted arbitrarily by the regression model and will be unstable. The proper thing to do here is to model the line in 2 dimensions. In order to do this, you can either eliminate one of the two predictor variables from the model, or you can project the line in 3-dimensions onto a 2-dimensional subspace (which is what PCA does). Of course, a line formed by data points in 2 dimensions (x and y) is very nicely modeled by ordinary linear regression and it will give very a stable slope (Beta) parameter.",1378311918

Then you have to hope that you car is still where you left it, and not towed or booted.<p>None of this excuses drunk driving, of course. The solution is to make plans, instead of just driving to the bar and assuming you&#x27;ll figure out what to do later.",1378310586

In addition to personality and cultural attitudes, your current position and your relationships with the people with whom  you are interested may hinder you to make the first move. You may simply want to keep it discreet.<p>Some example situations; you left your previous position and you want to come back, but are reserved to make the first move back to your previous boss. You are a well known programmer, and you are well connected to people, but you are reserved to make the first move. You want to hire your service provider, you want to hire your client, you want to hire a competitor etc. I accept that in majority of the cases employers and employers don&#x27;t hesitate to make the first move, but I just try to contemplate some cases where Jobrupt may work.  Finally this is just an experimental idea, and if it works for some people in some communities it will be worth the effort.",1378310568

Especially one with a video camera in the car (most major metropolitan cab companies).<p>Uber, on the other hand, make a point of distinguishing their drivers from the rabble. If they can establish trust with the athletes that whether or not they are recognized, they will never be talked about, recorded, etc. it may help with the adoption of the service.<p>Plus, Uber have also positioned themselves as a lifestyle brand. Hailing or calling for a cab may feel like it is below the station of a professional athlete. Uber have positioned themselves to be a sort of modern, distributed chauffeur.<p>They are all small things, but both as a PR win, and a potential tool in the box of the NFL who are desperate to get a handle on the off-field bad-choices of their athletes, this doesn&#x27;t seem like a bad thing.",1378310555

You were put on hold for several minutes, you had to explain where you were, the driver could not show up or show up extremely late.<p>When you are inebriated, these steps can easily be considered overwhelming and lead to many people not wanting to go through the process.<p>In contrast to open phone > tap uber app > tap call cab. The difference is night and day, and I think that&#x27;s why the program will succeed now when it has failed before.",1378310462

You save quite a bit by going with a reserved instance, where you pay about $70 up-front but then your monthly instance price is almost halved, coming in at around $32 per/mo.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s going to be more cost-effective at a lower level to go with something like Redis-to-go, Openredis, etc... if you need something simple.<p>Long story short, if you&#x27;re on Heroku and (like me) were thinking/hoping that this might be a nice alternative to the various add-ons available ... I don&#x27;t think that the juice is worth the squeeze. One, you have to administer and maintain things yourself (which is trivial for something like this, so not a big deal) but the pricing doesn&#x27;t line up. The Redis providers leading the market today are able to do so because they provision the heavy-hitter EC2 nodes and then chop them up.<p>It&#x27;s important to note though you can get a free micro instance for a year on the free usage tier. Micro&#x27;s are like the section-8 housing of the server world, but free is free and beggars can&#x27;t be choosers ;)",1378310420

In a way you illustrate the point being made:<p><i>but according to his own statements he doesn't write enough Perl to really know it. He just sprouts lots of opinions on things he don't know</i><p>From the point of view of a professional programmer as simpler language like Lua takes hours to learn. What you loose is the power of expression, however for a novice one doesn't perhaps want this power. For example if I were writing a platform for photographers, I wouldn't choose a perl as an extension language: it depends on the audience.<p>Don't get me wrong I've written perl in commercial environments since 1994, and privately before that.  Goladus makes a good point.",1253962760
845331,comment,844105,844105,0,0,hoggle,,,"Uninteresting! Financially oriented issues like these don't bother me at all. Who needs so much money these days when everything (services, hard- and software) is so damn cheap. I don't need anybody investing in our venture. I've got a part time day job which supports me at least up to the RMS standard of living. Who cares about all this bloated so called financial infrastructure. This is just distracting and I don't get it. Create something you love first - if you need some money beyond that for investing in your infrastructure or the likes then do the good old credit card bootstrapping. Should be enough. Don't hire people do it together with some capable people you trust and like to be with. I thought this place would be more about hacking than plain old ""dirty"" money. P.S. sorry for OT ranting but I couldn't resist, pipe to /dev/null if you please",1253962606

845322,comment,844692,844878,0,0,m0nty,,,"Yup, just hang up: it's not as rude as they're being to you. As for the unwanted emails, I set up Gmail filters to forward emails back to the sender (and delete the original) if I don't want to hear from them. Most of the time, I think they assume the message bounced, even though it's not a bounce message. I suppose additional mischief could be made by forwarding the email to everyone at that company, or to a rival recruitment agency, etc.",1253962200

845315,comment,842462,842462,0,0,akrymski,,,"Great achievement.  Some may argue dropbox is a feature rather than a business, something Windows / OS X should do out of the box.  And indeed they should, but they don't (not nearly that well anyway).  But as soon as the success of DropBox is evident, I think we can expect the next version of OS X to have a ""dropbox"" that's part of their mobile me strategy, and MS to finally push out this feature aggressively.  After all they are both after recurring revenues of this sort.  Let's hope they buy DropBox before then.",1253961757

But at the same time, if you consider the G1 as a ""baseline"" set of requirements, do you really want manufacturers putting out anything less?  It's already more-or-less commodity hardware available or $100 or less from the carrier, so there's not much incentive to skimp any further without destroying the UX.",1253960675

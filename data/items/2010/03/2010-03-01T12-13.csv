I think even that is expensive never mind suggesting paying them £120 a month <i>whether you watch the BBC channels or not</i>.<p>When you compare what you get from Sky (if you are into sports and movies and the US shows on Sky 1), the BBC license fee is steep enough.<p>That said, they do provide a good service, and wouldn't be able to if it was not for the license fee model, but it does annoy me that I cannot opt out of watching BBC and waive the license fee and yet still watch Sky Sports becasue its a against the law!",1267448232

OTOH, it's a complex system, with stack upon stack of hardware, firmware and software that makes really groking it (as I did with my Apple IIs in the early 80's) next to impossible. Even before the OS loads, an x86 PC is a very complicated animal.<p>As for the Windows notebook I am typing this in, it never ceases to amaze me and surprise me in almost always frustrating ways. It's indeed a box full of magic, but I am not sure its genies always work for me rather than against me.<p>I have tried a couple times to move to FreeBSD, but I always got frustrated with, what I perceived, a purist view of what a Unix machine should be - clean, simple and somewhat bare.

But even in the scenario you suggest, with finite resources, why put money into antibiotics development? Why not just fund cancer research at a higher level? I think most pharmas wouldn't want to take the risk that the governmnt would leave them holding the bag. Contrary to the popular meme, drug companies don't generally want to sit on a drug that is ready to go.<p>But all that aside, there is nothing stopping the NIH from starting a research program and developing their own antibiotics (or any academic institution). This happens a bit already, but then it comes time to run the clinical trials and develop the research compound into an actual medicine. This requires expertise and infrastructure that does not exist in the public sector at a sufficient level to get the job done.",1267446983
1158573,comment,1158189,1158393,0,0,rubinelli,,,"I read an article on Gamasutra a long time ago about this kind of experiment with mice (sadly, my google-fu was weak.) The researchers compared how much effort mice would put into pushing a lever N times to get food vs. pushing a lever that had a 1/N chance of giving food. What they saw was that, if they had a fixed goal, their ""motivation"" would follow a seesaw pattern: right after they got their prize, they would ignore the lever for a while, but when they were a few pushs from getting food, they would go nuts on it. The random lever got constant attention at a higher average.
The author translated this to Diablo: the player has leveling up, which is a fixed, visible goal that the player can strive for, and random equipment drops, that keep him hooked even when other incentives are one or two hours away.
Another game to consider: Civilization. I know you all experienced the just-one-more-turn, why-are-birds-chirping-outside effect. It does it by interleaving minor and major goals in different areas, so you don't have motivation valleys, only peak after peak.",1267446928

Exercise routines that combine eccentric and concentric contractions (where the muscle shortens as it contracts) are probably more effective at increasing strength than ones that focus only on concentric contractions.<p>This is a really big error, and I don't see how it could be a typo.  Agonist (""doer"") and antagonist (opposing) muscles contract simultaneously when stabilizing a joint, but when lifting weights, the antagonists of the primary action (triceps and to some extent anconeus for curls) are relaxed both during concentric and eccentric contraction of the agonists (biceps, brachialis, and to some extent brachioradialis and a few other muscles of the forearm for curls).

Also, conceptually it doesn't matter whether you deploy by pushing to the live system, or by triggering a script on the live system which pulls from the test system. Both achieve exactly the same, so both are <i>equally good or bad</i>. However, the push is more comfortable.<p>Regarding 2): I have a scenario at home where such a push makes a lot of sense. There is a stationary computer and a laptop, both of which have a common document repository (using Mercurial). Synchronization happens when the laptop is at home. It's just ""hg pull -u ; hg push"". The laptop needs access to the stationary computer, but not vice versa.<p>If I avoided the push, I'd have to trigger a script on the stationary computer which in turn pulls from the laptop.

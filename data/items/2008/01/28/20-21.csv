105764,comment,104919,105491,0,0,curi,,,"It's strange you would think I had said our current culture is the random whim of <i>nature</i>. I actually think it is a mix of the good ideas and mistakes of <i>people</i> not nature. My comments the entire time have been human-centric in where they attribute causes.<p>Why does our culture have major gender roles that permeate people's personalities, today? It's not because it made logical sense in the past. Whether it did or not then, it does not now. And hasn't for some time. And this has been pointed out on a number of occasions. A particularly well-stated case was made by William Godwin in the 1790s.<p>What happened? People did not listen. They let their biases and closed-mindedness and unreasonableness get in the way of progress. That is the reason gender roles remain entrenched. If people were more thoughtful during the last few hundred years, then we wouldn't have recognizable gender roles today. That's the sort of cause I consider important and meaningful to explaining the present day situation.<p>Another fact of the situation is that parents teach gender roles to their children, whether the children like it or not, and without regard for whether it is helpful or hurtful, useful or not, makes sense or not, etc In a culture which does this, it isn't reasonable to say the gender roles exist because they are correct: the mechanism which perpetuates them does not depend on them being correct, and people are unwilling to change it so that it does.",1201553999

You would have taken the same position about mountains. Or, I take it, hurricanes, earthquake zones, forks, dolls, different types of houses, TV shows, anything (though some things are more or less influential).<p>I guess to start with, you have said living in mountain regions is <i>correlated</i> with different kinds of culture. But you have not said by what mechanism it causes it. Which actually is the same question I kept asking about genes. So please do answer it.",1201553241

I don't have to write compilers or distributed databases. I have problems where co-workers write ""WARNING:"" in capital letters in messages to the user, effectively yelling at them. I have problems where co-workers write, ""5 selected album(s)"" because they can't be bothered to write an ""if"" statement to conditionally remove the pluralization. I have problems where co-workers write the entire text of a dialog box in bold and don't line up the title and the body of the message. Those are the problems I have, and hackers aren't going to help me. In fact, hackers are the ones most likely to commit these errors because user interfaces bore them.</i><p>Yes, user inferaces bore me. I wrote a recursive layout generator so I'd never have to worry about lining up anything ever again, so I literally do not have the problems he does at work.

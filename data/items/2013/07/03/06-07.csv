Your phrasing of &quot;piggyback your plugin into popular installers to get this on millions of computers&quot; sounded like you were planning to sneak it in without users&#x27; awareness.  If it&#x27;s an explicit opt in, then I would have no great problem with that from a user perspective.  (Of course as a user I&#x27;d prefer to just install what I want, rather than being presented with options for a bunch of unrelated stuff, but advertising and affiliate programs keep things going, so I deal with it.)<p>Personally don&#x27;t have a problem with the part about scraping something I might post on a classifieds site.

The Sovereign touches the sword and, by that gesture, returns it to the Lord Mayor with implied permission to carry it before her whilst she is in the City. Also by ancient custom the permission of the Lord Mayor is sought for the passage of troops through the City, and he receives quarterly, under the Sovereign&#x27;s sign manual, the password of the Tower of London. As spokesman for the citizens, he is entitled to the right of special access to the Sovereign.<p>They&#x27;re essentially a small enclave of &quot;free&quot; [1] people who are allied with Liz, smack dab in the middle of London. Most of the previous Lord Mayors of the City of London were descendants of the people who forced King John to sign the Magna Carta.

5982896,comment,5982041,5982537,5,0,joeyo,,,"There is a considerable body of evidence that &quot;top-down&quot; processes affect not only how sensory evidence is processed, but how the sensations themselves are experienced. In other words, high-level (but subconscious) neural &quot;judgments&quot; about the statistics of the world, actually influence how you perceive it. To put it still another way: sensations aren&#x27;t simply passively experienced; they are actively constructed by the brain. Phantom phone vibration is, in many ways, just as &quot;constructed&quot; as real phone vibration.<p>Perceptual illusions provide one of the clearest ways to show that sensations reflect factors other than external stimuli. Here are two illusions, in different sensory modalities, that demonstrate the strong top-down influence of the brain on perception: The rubber hand illusion [1,2] and the McGurk effect [3,4]. The rubber hand illusion is particularly relevant because it is quite similar to the phantom phone vibration effect.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_hand_illusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_hand_illusion</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCQbygjG0RU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCQbygjG0RU</a><p>3. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect</a><p>4. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0</a><p>EDIT: Here&#x27;s an additional example to consider. People generally can&#x27;t tickle themselves. The sensations are less strong when one touches oneself than when someone else does so. The explanation for this is that the brain automatically discounts sensations which arise as a result of self-motion. This has obvious advantages, namely that you don&#x27;t constantly overstimulate yourself just in the process of moving through the world and are as such better able to attend to important externally generated stimuli.",1372834514

When Google started reader, and more importantly, when they put the sign out front saying &quot;come hither for a hassle free web RSS client that <i>keeps a backup of all the feeds you visit even if they go down</i> and everyone said &quot;hells yeah&quot; because it was from a <i>web supergiant</i> and those don&#x27;t very often go under since 2001.<p>So we got dependent. And they pulled the rug out. People <i>only</i> got dependent on the assumption it would be persistent. Google&#x27;s entire business is making things that don&#x27;t make them money but give them more avenues for ads. And your freaking <i>news feed</i> from <i>Google</i> is the <i>best</i> place I can imagine for targeted advertising and to figure out a users browsing habits. My emails are stuffed with spam, my google searches could be anyone, but you can reliably say <i>I&#x27;m</i> browsing my reader feeds and <i>I&#x27;m</i> interested in the articles I am opening and <i>those</i> are the ultimate target for advertising.<p>I&#x27;d say something about how social networks factor in, but I don&#x27;t use any them (or Twitter) so I could care less. But I highly doubt that Google got its desired outcome from killing Reader - they lost a vast swathe of technical users and lost confidence from even more, and they won&#x27;t see these people move over to consuming content on Google Plus because they don&#x27;t give a crap how many dog treats the neighbors dog ate yesterday, they care about xkcd strips or gamasutra article feeds. You get a wall of shit on Google+ that you can at least curate in the RSS world. Why I would ever want to use it I have no idea. If I want to talk or interact with people, I&#x27;ll use XMPP or SMTP. If I want to consume textual or image based media with consistent publication, I&#x27;ll use RSS. Notice how I keep quoting <i>protocols</i> - because they are open and interoperable. I can expect other people to be ably to reliably target said protocols and distribute their content to anyone that wants it because you have a myriad of tools to access them. That share on G+ button only works with G+, and like the article said, Google wants you stuck on their services.<p>So I switched the default search engine on my grandparents, mother, cousins, and neighbors to duckduckgo. I&#x27;m looking for free web email services that compete with gmail to drop that too, because who knows when Google will rip that rug out from under us as well. &quot;Why are you sending emails? Just send G+ messages! You are all on G+ right? It is expensive to keep a copy of all those email attachments!&quot;",1372832801

Although I have experience using Ember, I was kind of put off by it because of a) the fundamental changes they made to the routing system in a very late stadium of the platforms development (AFAIK it was officially introduced in Ember 1.0 prerelease) and b) Ember can be a mind-bender sometimes when youre working on a large application (having many views and sub-views).<p>So, I was looking at AngularJS as a potential alternative. At first glance it seems quite straightforward. Until I saw this:<p>Cage Match  Ember.js vs. AngularJS : <a href=""http://vimeo.com/68215606"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/68215606</a><p>I know that Tome Dale (Ember.js) and Rob Conery (AngularJS) only demo the respective platforms superficially in this video, but it got me leaning towards Ember again.<p>To comment on your wish to have a batteries included framework, which I can use in production: Ember certainly has a lot of batteries included: its a framework that makes opinionated choices how you should build a web app.",1375552537

That seems the best definition I can think of: when you say you&#x27;re doing a startup, I can implicitly understand that you&#x27;re trying to build a scalable business that can grow very quickly. It also means that in addition to figuring out what your product should be, you are also in search of a sustainable growth strategy.<p>Of course, lots of people outside this definition call their small businesses &quot;startups&quot;,esp tech people, and it feels like this is because they want to be part of the startup community.

You want something that is popular to start with because a) there will be a large support community and b) there will be more jobs available for someone who knows a popular framework. That second point is most important, because until you start building/working on an in-production project, most of your efforts will be purely academic. Once you have some years of experience under your belt, you can reflect on the technologies you know and figure out where you would like to grow into next.<p>Ultimately, the goal is to be in a position where you can confidently examine new and old frameworks and techniques, and make confident, informed decisions about what to use. But at the beginning of your career, you won&#x27;t have the experience and perspective to make those decisions, so just start working on something and don&#x27;t worry about making sure it&#x27;s the 100% right thing for all time.<p>Good luck!",1375549421

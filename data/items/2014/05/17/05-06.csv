Plants that eliminated the need for petro fertilizers by enriching the soil like clover and were resistant to disease and insects. Instead I somehow ended up in this Bizarro World, where Dr. Evil runs Monsanto. Where they’ve turned large tracks of fertile land into a barren, sterile wasteland that can only grow their GMO crops.<p>How can we turn the tide back, so that government serves the people instead of big corporations?

6074858,comment,6070271,6070506,1,0,drewcoo,,,"I don&#x27;t care. Nobody in my family cares. None of my friends care. Even the gamers I know don&#x27;t really care about more pixels. We, all of us, use computers all of the time, on our phones, our PCs, watches, glasses, tablets, readouts everywhere we go . . . computing is damned near ubiquitous. We&#x27;re a hop, skip, and a jump from Blade Runner already.<p>Further, I don&#x27;t understand how higher graphics density or bigger displays are &quot;lack of innovation&quot; in the PC market. That&#x27;s a wonderful non sequitur that leads to argument (as seen in reaction to your comment) but it&#x27;s still a non sequitur.<p>Microsoft used to be driven by the goal of a computer in every home and on every desk in every office. That was crazy at the time. That was also an amazing clarion call that all of us &#x27;softies (I was one back in the day) could get behind. And Microsoft, evil as it can sometimes be, was willing to drag everyone else along into that glorious future.<p>Mission accomplished. (Applause is appreciated here but not expected.)<p>Now they&#x27;re flailing a bit. Both Microsoft and the PC makers. And it has nothing to do with graphics. Not really. It has to do with not finding a new niche to fill to make the way humans experience the world better. More pixels is not better for most of us. And just to restate: let&#x27;s make the world better for humans.<p>Once upon a time spreadsheets were a killer app. Everyone who wants to use a spreadsheet probably has a machine that can do that now. Then there was the Internet . . . again, probably everyone&#x27;s happy enough now. What&#x27;s the next killer use for a PC? That remains to be seen. That&#x27;s the point of the article. And if there were such an easy answer as &quot;we need better graphics&quot; I&#x27;m reasonably sure that tech journalists, naive as you might think they all are, would all rejoice because they&#x27;d all already be busy explaining that to all of us in the kind of detail that corporate sponsors&#x27; ads would happily show us. That makes them money, sells copy, and gives them a warm feeling as they drift off to sleep at night. Wonderful!<p>If you really want to kvetch about how someone&#x27;s missing the boat, please point your finger at everyone here (including the two of us) and ask us all what matters to most people and what we&#x27;re doing about it. I don&#x27;t mean &quot;cult of the new&quot; crap that the echo chamber talks about most of the time on HN. I mean &quot;something that substantially changes the lives of a large body of non-techy people&quot;. Consider health, travel, money management, alerting, data backup, data protection, et al. I see very geek-specific examples here on HN but I&#x27;ve yet to see many examples that are universally useful for regular people. I have seen none that I&#x27;d recommend to my parents without expecting them to need hand-holding.<p>In the mid-90s there were lots of people buying PCs running Windows to play games and run spreadsheets and be online and write papers and find porn and . . . you name it. There were needs. There aren&#x27;t now. They&#x27;re satisfied.<p>And that is why the PC and Microsoft are stalled. And that is why most startups (or non-startups) don&#x27;t matter. And that is what you should think about as you fire up your next plan to be king of the world. People, not pixels. What do they <i>need</i>?",1374316840

The thing just really doesn&#x27;t work on many levels. We make apps for it because clients ask us too, but I would never use that thing in it&#x27;s current form for anything other than that. I have done for a few months and it was a joke. So with aggressive marketing (which I see all around me here) they manage to sell a lot of these phones, but do people actually <i>like</i> them? I haven&#x27;t seen anyone happy with it except a few people here on HN.

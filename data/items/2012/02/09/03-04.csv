3569741,comment,3569443,3569443,7,0,twainer,,,"Sorry, but this post is based on a false notion that intellectual property is a beneficial crutch propping up only corporations and piggybacks on the idea that destruction of entrenched interests is always regenerative. That second point is likely so - but the battle isn't about finding new corporate captains to pay creative individuals - it's about how not to pay creative individuals.<p>I find the irony very sad that we are supposed to move from an industrial to a post-industrial knowledge-based economy - one presumably underpinned by the ability and right of individuals to monetize their knowledge . . . but people have had their free lunch and prefer it instead, perhaps as some salve.<p>I've said it 1000 times - if you don't like how corporations conduct their business, set something up yourself and if you have a better solution, you'll eventually find yourself a real market. The willy-nilly urge to destroy intellectual property rights for individuals and corporations alike is nothing more than a selfish catharsis - without any sense - neither common-sense, nor business-sense, nor a sense of history. When you take power away, it hurts the weakest first and the strongest last - all the while preserving the existing power structure. That's not a smart solution for anything.",1328759875
3569740,comment,3566973,3568689,3,0,philwelch,,,"You're totally right, but like any old, ""high"" art, Shakespeare's popularity partially includes people who actually get it and enjoy them and partially includes people who are self-congratulatory about how ""cultured"" they are. In Shakespeare's time, it was basically popular entertainment with lots of violence and dirty jokes, but there's centuries of difference in language and cultural context that provides a barrier to entry for contemporary audiences, and likewise there's an air of artistic prestige to it that's grown in the intervening centuries, so the way someone in Elizabethan England would watch a Shakespeare play for fun is extremely different from the cultural practice of Shakespeare productions today.<p>Music's another good example--from any objective standpoint, there's music being produced today that matches or exceeds the artistic merit of any of the old composers; likewise, tons of the old composers were popular musicians in their own day. But there's an awkward separation between high culture and popular culture, mostly based on how old something is.<p>It might come off as silly to actually portray this in science fiction, but it's interesting to wonder how people a century or two from now will approach the art we're producing today. Will there be cover bands performing Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"" who are treated with the same reverence as contemporary orchestras performing Wagner operas? Will people wear formal clothing and sit quietly, not realizing that it was meant to be music for sweaty teenagers to run around and body-slam each other to?",1328759861

3569690,comment,3566973,3568795,3,0,philwelch,,,"<i>The military does not adhere to rigorous discipline because that is an effective way to accomplish general human endeavors. They do it because committing violence against other human beings is extremely difficult to get human beings to do. And when they do it, they are torn apart with post-traumatic stress disorders, depression, anxiety, and all sorts of negative effects. In order to be able to overcome the conscious brains prohibition on violence, soldiers must be trained so that their muscle memory can kill before their conscious mind can prevent them from doing it. And sticking to a simple routine with no allowance for individual diversity and the like makes it easiest to continue functioning in traumatic situations. These techniques don't work in any other human endeavor at all.</i><p>Star Trek takes place on ships and space stations, so let's consider the typical carrier battle group, which consists of at least one aircraft carrier, a deployed carrier air wing, and various support ships. In the course of its mission, the people of this carrier battle group will safely launch, control, pilot, land, and maintain high-performance jet aircraft from the deck of a ship; maintain and operate ship systems including computers, electricity, fresh and waste water, communications, and propulsion--which fairly often entails operating a nuclear reactor; feed, clothe, deliver mail to, provide comprehensive health care for, and maintain the fitness and morale of thousands of people at sea; and occasionally, sometimes, launch cruise missiles or carry out bombing attacks against land targets hundreds of miles away. Very few of the crew actually engage in anything close to combat, and those who do have distance and technological abstraction separating them from the effects of their actions. Tests have shown that naval aviators actually experience more stress landing on an aircraft carrier than in combat.<p>The purpose and applicability of <i>naval</i> tradition is not to desensitize people to killing; it's to coordinate many different people doing many different jobs to work together cohesively. And it is certainly directly applicable to a wide range of human endeavors. Of course, it doesn't entail ""sticking to a simple routine with no allowance for individual diversity""--that kind of command-and-control structure was shown to be ineffective as recently as World War II, where the most effective militaries were the ones with the most disagreement, political infighting, and allowance for individual initiative.<p>You've got an internally consistent narrative, but it doesn't match reality, and while I could certainly get into a flamewar with you, it would make more sense for you to read some recent military history and modern military doctrine, get to know some veterans, and really educate yourself about this.

The patent system is the way it is because big companies like it that way.  The <i>reason</i> they like it that way is they can strangle any nascent competition with patent lawsuits before that competition has a chance to grab market share.<p>And it doesn't even matter whether or not the claim is valid - small companies can't afford to defend themselves, whether or not they win in court.  The point of suing a small company for patent infringement isn't to collect money, it's to <i>put that company out of business</i>.",1328757018

I'm not entirely sure what I would do in your shoes, but some places start looking may be:<p>Why are Fourier series on the curriculum?  There must be a reason why they are so important that a whole undergraduate course would be dedicated to them.<p>How and when were Fourier series first described?  I understand Joseph Fourier made some pretty major contributions to maths.  What was he trying to achieve?  Did Fourier series help him do it?  Why did other people pay attention, and how was the idea popularised?<p>Finally, if you really don't know anything about EE or any other applications for it may be a good idea for you to lean a bit more about the various fields that are built on top of yours.  Having a better understanding about how your area of interest relates to others is always a good thing.<p>I know from a software point of view, even though they are hidden from day to day coding, Fourier series are hugely important.  Fourier series allow us to compress audio and images down to sizes where they can easily be transferred across the internet [1].  Almost every single digital image you see, song you listen to and movie you watch will have had a fourier transform applied to it.  Did you know that movies on netflix account now account for 32% of north american internet traffic?  Without the fourier transform its safe to say the world wide web as we know it would not exist.<p>Furthermore, because it is actually practical to transfer movies and songs across the internet, mass piracy of media is possible.  Millions of people are sharing (fourier transform compressed!) movies over sites like the pirate bay.  This has lead to a backlash from established media corporations demanding stronger copyright protections.  Currently a huge legislative battle is being fought, which will have a impact on such disparate areas as the future of censorship, what rights people have over the things they create and the role of money in politics.<p>All because of what the fourier series lets us do!<p>This is, to put it mildly, of some interest :-)<p>[1] : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform</a>",1328756954

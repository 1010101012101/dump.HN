My company has an exchange server for 200 or so people, and at any one point there are probably one or two people who are waiting for a password reset, errors with Calendar, public folder permissions errors, or other human error on the part of the helpdesk interns.  That's a 100x increase from Google's error rate in this scenario, but it's perfectly acceptable within the context of our organisation.<p>That's why we have tape backups (which can take some time / effort to restore from).  I think the difference is that if a user at my company has a problem they can call a human being and be told that someone is working on it, but with Google you can't do that.",1298976965

But people bitching here that developers at MS don't have it well off - are being ignorant about majority of industry where developers are still being under-utilized to everyones dismay.<p>And Microsoft's care of intellectual workers is top tier. Even the ones that are not well off (sitting in a room with 10 other people) are better off than 90% of our industry.<p>Indeed some people get to have anything they want or need - good for them. Even better if it makes the end result better. It's good that they don't get into situation as I have in multiple occasions - running a top priority, code red development effort which if fails it will take the company down, and then when I needed a new virtual appliance I got informed that I cannot get is since the ESX is out of harddrives and that there will be no purchases since the budged has already been spent.<p>And this is the industry standard - not the ""I run bazillion node supercluster"".<p>Hell where I used to work - two of the interns went and bought 2 24"" monitors each out of their own money to use them at work.",1298976580

In retrospect it is a genius financial move, because he made money from it whereas a lot of people who went all in and then rode the bubble all the way till it popped lost everything.<p>But (amongst other things) what I think he was doing was stating basically that free software carries with it no such ties, there are no hidden strings saying ""yes, have this and play with it, but if you hit it big I want some"" - there was no obligation - and by rejecting the shares in that way he was making the point forcefully.",1298975558

I currently have a job working for a company that develops products for MS and some other clients, using MS tools.<p>That said, I'm a bit concerned about my health, and will be taking routine medical checks. Nevertheless, I'm not an addict (no, really). Although I use it now and then, I don't crave for it, nor I need it all the time. It's just an extra help for certain situations, like taking coffee when you're asleep, or ibuprofene when you have a mild headache (that perhaps could be solved by going to bed for a couple hours, but you have to keep working/stuying).<p>Prohibition, like on many other things, won't do any good to anyone, except maybe the ones that sell the drugs.",1298974379

My local supermarket has a whole aisle filled with essentially identical products in different packaging (many from the same manufacturer/conglomerate). Ironically, this proliferation of meaningless branding seems to push out genuine choice: despite the acres of shelf space devoted to washing powders, I can't buy an ecologically sound washing powder here.<p>(2) Travel insurance. The choices faced for insurance (and other financial products) are genuinely overwhelming: to sensibly choose between the hundreds of available policies I'd need to read and compare the T&Cs for each one. I'd enormously prefer there to be some central body mandating a minimum standard for travel insurance (or maybe 2 or 3 levels of minimum standards) and then just pick the cheapest policy adhering to my standard of choice.<p>In the absence of this, companies often appear to go out of their way to make it difficult to compare their products with others' -- mobile/cell-phone plans are a case in point here.<p>In short, the 'paradox of choice' should really be 'the paradox of pointless artificial choices'... but then it becomes more obvious that it's only a paradox if you were previously a sucker for economic theory at its purest and most crazy.",1298974356

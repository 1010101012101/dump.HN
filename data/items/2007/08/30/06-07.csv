Are you going to go on to tell me black people suck at programming to because they don't compose 25% of that list (but do compose 25% of graduates in CS from the stats you linked)? <p>Get over yourself.<p>",1188455379

No...he's clearly doing CRUD work</i><p>This guy wrote Mongrel, which is a very solid HTTP server - the most common way to deploy Ruby applications these days. Also he was one of the guys on ruby-lang who discovered nasty bugs in Ruby's threading implementation (everybody else just preferred bitching about ""unreliable"" Ruby threads and memory leaks)\n",1188454433

Sure, you have to do a lot of things you don't want to do. But, you also don't have many opportunities to learn things that are totally impractical from true experts in the field. Take advantage. Love every minute. Get out of there and do something amazing. <p>Last, a lot of the people I met in college are incredibly smart and amazingly successful. Some of them work on the most innovative software around. Some write for world-renowned publications. And some of them just have really rich parents. No matter what, if you go to a good university, you will meet people that will help you someday later. Yah, privilege is a bitch, but if you have the opportunity to have it, why not? \n",1188454222

This is like Ohio State losing a football game to Oberlin in terms of sheer population advantage. <p>Then again... there are no ultimate scholarships, and I know a guy from FB who was a star ultimate player at stanford. \n",1188453985

Yes I love the SICP videos and noticed that - but then they were done in the 80's, wasn't sure if things had changed somewhat since then. <p>In my limited exploration, I always though CL was showing its age, yet scheme seemed more ""timeless"" - if you can say that about programming languages.

48145,comment,48061,48061,0,0,tx,,,"It's not the speed of connections what is holding web applications back, it's poor runtime. DOM+JS without <i>standard</i> local storage, with complete absence of <i>standard</i> libraries for anything but trivial, without any access to PC hardware... Pretty pathetic... It is especially ironic to see ridiculously slow speed of simple Flash 2D graphics running full screen on a kick-ass video card. <p>Besides, it's not only speed what matters, there is latency issue as well. With HTTP I cannot tell much difference (visually) when going from 3mbps to 12mbps unless I'm downloading an ISO file or something like that. Browser will not open more than 2 connections at a time anyway.",1188453676

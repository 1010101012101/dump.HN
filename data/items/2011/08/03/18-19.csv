For as much as claims of safety are thrown about, people should spend more time looking at how congestion causes and compounds accidents.<p>Maybe if they weren't over-regulated* and actually assigned the costs associated with blocking traffic, the trucking companies could come up with something as novel as a 'governor override budget'. I.e., ""If you find yourself in a situation where you need to pass and it'd be best for everyone involved if you actually get it over with, you may do so. Just don't expect to spend the whole trip at the higher speeds because you only accrue so many override minutes per hour and you need to save them for complications that may arise. There are gas prices to consider, after all.""<p>If we're going to insist on having humans behind the wheel, I assume it's because they have the capacity to reason. Ultimately, we need to incent them properly and then trust their judgement.<p>* Speed limits significantly below the 85th percentile of traffic == revenue.

I imagine there's an incentive to fill a train to capacity whereas you can contract as many trucks as you need for a particular load.<p>Further, a bunch of trucks can go from one distribution point to many different unloading points a train may not be able to reach.<p>I imagine the explosion in consumer shipping and expectations of two-day shipping from a number of companies has changed the dynamic.

You aren't even ""traveling"" in the sense that you get to see different places.  You're just burning away life with no time to do anything besides listen to radio shows/music. We should all be so lucky that we're never in that position.<p>My dad used to work for a company that sold communication services at truck stops. He always told me that it's important to not change into the right now too soon after passing them and to just remind that they've got a blindside much larger than a car.  Pretty simple stuff, but I bet most people don't think about it. I've driven on I-80 a good amount at night when it's almost all truck drivers and I've never had a problem.

I still do think self-esteem is a critical component; when you are hiring people to be a cog in the wheel, the last thing you look for is individuality - so yes, when herding the sheep, as a manager you come from the power position and benefit by taking care of your sheep so they output most effectively.<p>But I suppose the question over which points are being argued here has more to do with what kind of personality we are talking about? Like I said, I agree with what you say when the person in question is desirable as a replaceable part (as is the case in many larger corporations) but I disagree when we start talking about autonomous individuals (the irreplaceable people in an organization - small or large).<p>I suppose it was my fault for relating the concept of ""remote worker"" with one of ""autonomous individual"" - when in fact there are people of many different personality types and roles that engage in remote working.",1312395676

Generally speaking, as a group, they are better drivers and more aware of the road than the average driver on the road.  Not all of them are, and some of them do make stupid mistakes or drive dangerously.  Sadly, from what I've seen, even the safest ones get flipped off and honked at just because the car driving too closely behind them apparently thinks the truck should be driving faster.<p>The financial information is pretty spot-on.  Some truck drivers are making $40K (or even more than that!).  The shabbiness of this depends on where they're based, of course, but it can be pretty comfortable.  Some drivers make significantly less than $40K.  It's a function of mileage and experience, for the most part.  I'd say $500/wk is probably lower than average, but it's certainly not unheard of.  Especially right now (I hate the phrase ""in the current economic climate"", but it's kind of relevant right now) loads are getting harder and harder to come by and the further ones tend to be the first that go.  The miles just aren't there and this can kill the driver's family's finances.<p>Really, when it comes down to it, if a driver runs you off the road, call the number on the back of the truck (please, have a passenger do it if there's one in the car).

2842226,comment,2841992,2842065,21,0,sgoraya,,,">> Is there some kind of widespread anger at truck drivers?<p>I'm just one data point, but I've driven the I-5 in California between the bay area and southern CA a lot (about 180,000 miles on my 2005 Tacoma truck) as well as Hwy. 99 in the same vicinity.<p>I'd say that I've become apathetic towards truck drivers in general.  I've been nearly run off the road twice (once where I was sure I was going to wreck real bad  - got lucky), been cutoff, etc. by truckers more times than I can remember.  Most truckers are safe, but the ones that are not can really skew your perception.  Considering, in most cases, when a 18-wheeler causes an accident (I've witnessed a few), there is little damage to their truck or to themselves...the 'regular' car on the other hand is usually destroyed with devastating injury to the occupants.<p>This story made me feel like a jerk for moment (I've flipped off truckers before) - but the emotional aspects of the story can be applied to everyone else on the road too.  Truckers are not the only ones that have to drive for their livelihood or have personal issues to deal with.",1312394744

It does not, as looking at this graph of US inflation/deflation time shows (1944 is when the dollar stopped being gold convertible):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Historical_Inflation_Ancient.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Historical_Inflation_An...</a><p>A few points:<p>1. The money supply around a currency not only contains the mined/minted instances of that currency, but also liquid currency-denominated assets, like customer bank balances.  So money supply is not necessarily bounded.<p>2. Inflation/deflation can be considered measures of the change in demand for the currency.  In times of deflation, holding money is valuable because it becomes more valuable.<p>3. From the above graph, you see that during the gold standard, inflation tended to be mostly balanced out by deflation in the long-term, so long-term inflation was low.  But in the short term, prices were very unstable as inflation jumped all over the place, and far more unstable even than fiat money in the past three turbulent years that we've seen.<p>4. From the point of view of an economy, inflation and deflation are not symmetric; because of the value of sitting on money during periods of deflation, savers do not tend to invest their money but move money from investments to cash savings.  This undermines economic activity.  But in an economy with a rich range of investment opportunities, moderate inflation does not penalise acquisition of money and does encourage investment.<p>If you want a non-performing store of value and don't mind big fluctuations in value, gold is there and we know how to secure gold rather well.  Bitcoins are another non-performing store of value with far more drastic fluctuations in value, and securing it involves the double vulnerability: physical security of storage media, information security of computations involving bitcoins.  And it is much easier to accidentally lose bitcoins than gold, pirate tales notwithstanding.",1330681122

Focus more on all the positive things that will happen when you succeed than thinking of all the bad things that will happen if you dont. It's easy to imagine all kinds of worst case scenarios, especially when your plagued by a a little doubt. Try to have faith and power through<p>2. Exercise! Trite as it might sound exercise is really important for mental well being and can lift your spirits if you're feeling down<p>3. Surround yourself with people that give you energy. Now I'm not saying you should only socialize with sycophants and  yay-sayers but some people can be a real drain on a persons motivation.<p>4. Embrace ""the fear"". So things are hard, you're not sure you going succeed. On the other hand, you can probably look back at similar times in your life which now seems like exciting  learning experiences. Realize that you're in the middle of one of those and chose be excited about it.<p>4. Don't let other people bring you down. Those who says it can't be done should get out of the way of those who are doing it. Some good ideas are only evident in hindsight so don't listen too much to the naysayers.<p>5. Get some perspective, even if things can seem bad and insurmountable I'm sure we all can imagine people who do everything for the same oppurtunity or people with far worse problems.<p>6. Adopt an attitude of every mistake being an learning opportunity.  Don't be angry at yourself for making them. Be glad that it didn't take you longer to find out your mistake and glad that youre wiser for it",1330680686

I developed non-medicated ways to cope (e.g. will make sure I have a lot of alone time for my brain to recharge, put EVERYTHING on a to do list right when I think about it so I don't forget, do small tasks immediately also so you don't forget, etc). You will find a way that works for you in time, so don't worry about that. Overall, I found that my interest in CS was overshadowed by other interests given what is probably a shared tendency to come up with lots of ideas, be creative, etc. I feel like there is a lot of pressure for people capable of completing engineering coursework to study engineering and take engineering jobs (especially since coding is hot right now), but I encourage you to really take a look at what your strengths are and what you love to do.

6111924,comment,6108581,6111472,1,0,nightski,,,"The thing is I could throw a bunch of Haskell at you but in the end it wouldn&#x27;t really mean anything.  When I embarked on learning the language there were many times I almost threw in the towel.  It was hard to see beyond the initial frustrations.  Haskell code looked confusing, verbose, ugly, and so on.  It was only by taking the time of going through this process that I came to an understanding - followed by appreciation.<p>But I don&#x27;t claim to be incredibly intelligent.  It is very possible you or someone else here could look at a heap of Haskell code and just immediately understand the advantages/disadvantages without having gone through learning all of the &quot;why&quot;.<p>Your time is yours.  Don&#x27;t let me try to tell you what to do with it.  Heck you can make a fortune just writing PHP so is there any reason to learn anything else?  I&#x27;d say anyone who loves their craft would want to at least give all new things a shot and invest some time into learning what is out there.<p>The project I took on initially to learn Haskell was translating a real time sparse 3D reconstruction computer vision algorithm.  It was incredibly daunting and challenging.  But in the end very worth it!",1374901063

When designing the rules for a legal system, for example, we can never have 100% correct outcome, so we have to decide whether we&#x27;re ok with 100 innocent people going to prison for every guilty person, or 1 innocent person, or 100 guilty people going free for every innocent person going to prison, etc.<p>Sociological systems are governed by laws of nature, and we can&#x27;t just ignore them any more than we can ignore the laws of physics. Zero tolerance is a copout. It sounds good, but real systems simply don&#x27;t work that way.

For example, given a function f(x,y), if we want to take one limit after another, the result might depend on the order in which the limits are taken.  In other words, taking limits is not commutative unless certain conditions are satisfied.<p>None other than the great Donald Knuth went so far as to claim that all of calculus could be taught without limits!  Quoting from [1]:<p>&quot;Students will be motivated to use O notation for two important reasons. First, it significantly simplifies calculations because it allows us to be sloppy  but in a satisfactorily controlled way. Second, it appears in the power series calculations of symbolic algebra systems like Maple and Mathematica, which todays students will surely be using.<p>For more than 20 years I have dreamed of writing a calculus text entitled O Calculus, in which the subject would be taught along the lines sketched above.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://micromath.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/donald-knuth-calculus-via-o-notation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://micromath.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/donald-knuth-calcu...</a>",1374898146

6111841,comment,6108469,6111456,3,0,chacham15,,,"> Far too many C programmers think that unsigned ints are an appropriate type to use simply because the quantity in question can never be negative, e.g. the length of a list or the size of a memory allocation.<p>size_t is the type for such things and it is defined by the standard to be unsigned. I would like to point out that since it is the standard that defined it, it is not the fault of an average programmer.<p>> What they fail to appreciate is that almost inevitably such values will get used in subtraction operations down the road, and then your chances of having a corner-case bug grow exponentially.<p>C has always had the approach that the language is hands off; meaning that if the programmer wants to shoot themselves in the foot they very well can. Furthermore, not using an unsigned int is not going to help the issue for two reasons: you might very well need the entire address space provided by the 32 bits and somewhere down the line you will eventually need to cast to size_t when you call malloc. The solution is to simply make sure that you test for overflow/underflow where appropriate or choose a different language.",1374897895

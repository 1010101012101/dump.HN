I have nothing to be jealous about. Not everything in life is about getting a billion of $.\nMy strong feelings are sparked by the fact that the article and some individual place so much importance in selling a company for $1bn, for the very small reason (at least!) that 99% of you won't even get a chance to do it.\nEntreprenurial spirit is a reward in itself! And Instagram lacks it through the very fact that it was established without so much as a vision of creating any cash-flow.

At the same time, you have to understand that not everybody is like us, and enough people that <i>where</i> given that feedback in the past have used that opportunity to ""argue"" that they really should have been hired or argue that the feedback was wrong. Between helping a stranger improve and avoiding a potential headache for themselves, as much as I would like to have had feedback on some interviews, I can't blame anyone for avoiding the issue altogether.<p><pre><code>  > Almost all interview questions I take a long time with.

I cant think of an instance where Ive been given the \n  > answer because of being unable to solve the problem.\n</code></pre>\nWell, that's one problem right there. The kind of companies that ask you the kind of questions that you say are beyond Fizz-Buzz, are usually just starters, to get the ball rolling, give you confidence and keep iterating after the first solution is reached if it isn't perfect, or by adding new constraints to make it so you have to keep thinking.<p>The interviewer most likely has allotted time for 2-5 of these questions in his interview, if you are taking all this time on the first one, then most likely you are not going to be highly regarded, as the interviewer hasn't got enough information to say wether the one question you answered is representative of your skills.<p><pre><code>  > Is a total of eight cumulative hours of interviewing with \n  > around seven different people not enough to get a good \n  > signal? What does this say about the interviewing process?\n</code></pre>\nIt says that they want to make sure they hire somebody who's ""a good fit"" and the hiring pool is high enough that they can get away with false negatives.<p><pre><code>  > Dont sell me your product, sell me your challenges\n</code></pre>\nThe fact that they talk about the business instead of the tech, at least gives you some confidence the company will not go belly up because they are selling cuecats. Of course it's not the best way to entice a developer, but it's not as much of a red flag to me as you make it out to be.",1367916540

5667089,comment,5665537,5665537,5,0,ronyeh,,,"Hi there,<p>Here's how I would describe this to a non-techie. Since you have a tech background, I hope you can use this as a starting point for diving into this interesting, but very deep, question.<p>==================<p>Is P equal to NP?<p>We built computers to solve tedious problems that we lazy humans don't want to do by hand.<p>Some problems are pretty easy for computers to solve. For example, if you ask a computer to look page by page through a book (e.g., Atlas Shrugged) to search for a particular sentence, it can do it blazingly fast. Even if you double the length of the book, the computer will only have to perform twice as much work (still blazingly fast).<p>We'll call all of these ""easy"" problems P (think: ""easy peasy"").<p>Other problems are a bit harder for our current computers to solve. If we ask a computer to guess my password (20 characters long), it'll take a while before it arrives at the right answer. But if you saw me write down my 20-character password on a post-it, it would be very easy for you (and the computer) to check. All you'd need to do is try to log in! We'll call all of these problems, which are possibly hard to solve, but very easy to check, NP problems.<p>So the question we don't know the answer to:<p>Are all the problems in NP actually solvable in an ""easy peasy"" way? That is, are the set of all problems in NP just the same as the set of all problems in P?<p>We don't know! And a lot of smart mathematicians are working on the answer. If P=NP, that means ""hard problems"" are actually ""easy problems."" This might mean that my computer password would be more easily guessed... and a bunch of other ramifications.<p>==================<p>This reddit post was linked to earlier: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mfswi/eli5_any_of_the_seven_millennium_prize_problems/c30mohh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mfswi/eli...</a><p>I thought it was a pretty good explanation (for me), so I hope you'll give it a chance.",1367916325

In that 3rd year I was promoted to lead programmer, we introduced an new computer system with a new language and started going after bigger customers. Something like that would have been stressful just a year earlier but I was on a roll, having mastered the art. P.S.

Unless you develop an open source project which gets love from thousands of people and becomes very popular, few companies are going to use just that as a basis for hiring you.<p>Unfortunately, this also conflicts with the fact most people do need to make a living in order to survive. Unless it's possible for one to live without income from a job, then relying on ""being noticed"" will probably not be a fruitful avenue.",1367913996

If I have to change my viewpoint, or choose not to express it, because someone finds it upsetting, then that is not freedom of speech.<p>So unless you think that people should be forced to curtail their speech and keep their opinions to themselves, whenever that opinion is offensive to someone who has (or feels they have) suffered some ill fortune, you should stop comparing what I proposed to do with willfully inciting violence towards myself.",1367913994

Smartphone owners tend to change theirs every year or so. Smartphones have become a commodity and are considered as disposable. PCs, not as much. It does not really make sense to compare both markets. They don't overlap that much.",1367913612

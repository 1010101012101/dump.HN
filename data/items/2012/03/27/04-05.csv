Companies are spending more on internet marketing to manage their reputation online. These companies publish their news, blogs, articles, events, press releases, newsletter etc. on different websites than traditional print publication or broadcast. They also maintain their previous searchable online published records as part of their business/website. Thousands of people participate in online public forums and share their views & contribute their opinions. All these opinions count for other readers.

There's also sort of a rule that you can't have a higher price than the market leader because it offers higher value (gets a lot of benefits such as biggest 3rd party ecosystem, most known, most trusted, most experienced, etc), so the competitors have to price their products at a discount, and try to win customers on price, even when their product (in isolation) is ""better"" than that of the market leader.

I would far prefer to work in a dynamic or functional shop.<p>Answers there would look something like this:<p><i>Explain public.</i><p>N/A<p><i>Explain private.</i><p>N/A<p><i>Explain protected.</i><p>N/A<p><i>What is an abstract class?</i><p>N/A<p><i>What is an interface?</i><p>Ah, we get to something shared... A list of functions that can be applied to an instance of a type without raising an error.<p>The times I've used Perl, Python, Javascript, and Common Lisp all do not relate to public/private/protected/abstract base class.  They have simply not been required to do the job, and I'm unsure whether they even carry the concepts with them without building an extension into the language.  I'm fairly sure a MOP could use it if you really wanted.<p>So while this test might be great for C++/Java/C# hiring... I don't even bother asking these questions when I'm on a Python/Bash/Perl hiring team.  They don't relate.<p>The questions aren't interesting. They can be Googled, and I would be brutally tempted to think better of someone if they stalled and I heard keys being whacked as they found the answers on Wikipedia or StackOverflow.<p>But, you know, maybe OO teams need their OO FizzBuzz.

That being said I think it's still worth applying, because there's a lot more details in an idea than fit in a YC application. Oftentimes there are months to a year or more of thought in a YC app that an idea-less team won't have the luxury of having if one of the YC partners suggests the idea/market to that team, even if done so subconsciously and without malice (i.e. not citing the specific application, or even remembering having read it.)",1332824024

3760076,comment,3758465,3758465,1,0,scottmp10,,,"First, I am a little surprised at the number of people that laud this UX.  The only time I have encountered it was in the Facebook for Android app and I found it not to be intuitive.  Even once I understood the behavior, it is not always obvious what will happen when you drag down since there is no indication that you are at the top of the stream.  You essentially have overloaded the pull-down action.<p>As to when this is patent worthy, I would argue no.  Pull-down is as basic an action as you can do.  The patent is equivalent to patenting the concept (as opposed to the engineering implementation) of selecting an item on a screen that a user points to with their hand.  Or the concept of performing an action when you click on an item on your desktop (since clicking is as basic on a mouse as swiping is on a touch screen).<p>To be fair, it is difficult to argue where to draw the line for patents and some people would probably argue that my examples should be patentable (regardless of whether they are - I don't actually know).  It just strikes me that rewarding people for these ""innovations"" does exactly nothing to increase people's effort to figure out a good UX for their product.",1332823919

Include the ABV (alcohol by volume) rating.  ""pour"" a glass of wine.  tell the user how many mls are in the glass.  (125 ml at 8%ABV is one unit. It's rare to see glasses that small, they're normally 175 ml or 250 ml.  And wine is usually much stronger.)  Then ask them how many units are in that glass.  Give them a score.  (and show them how much of that glass is just one unit)  Repeat for 5 glasses.  Show them the difference between what they guessed and true.

As he says, the kids' favourite plant was The Chomper. Why would that be their favorite plant? The only explanation I can think of is that they like the fact that it eats zombies. So it goes without saying that they would pay attention to the moment The Chomper eats the zombie and all the little details of the event.<p>Also, we all pay attention to different things, and ignore different things. So even though children notice a lot of things we don't, we probably notice a lot of things they don't. In fact, I'd bet that us adults could notice more things than kids, if we tried. The problem is that what we notice is biased by our expectations which have evolved over the years (for example, we've learned to ignore the zombie arm sticking out of the plant because it isn't important), whereas children look at everything with fresh eyes, which forces them to pay attention, which in turn makes them notice things we've stopped looking for long ago.

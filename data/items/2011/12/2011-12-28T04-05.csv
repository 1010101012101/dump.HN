What's up with that?"" but then if you think about it for even a second you see that the reason is because these are the kind of stories hackers are either finding interesting or are intellectually stimulating to them.<p>The problem with vague guidelines like the ones here are that what qualifies as meeting those guidelines changes with the community. This could be a good thing in cases where the community is made up of all high caliber individuals that are simply maturing or changing as a group but if those changes are a result of the community simply being diluted with riff raff then it turns against us.<p>Anyway, I know what you mean.

3398663,comment,3398517,3398517,16,0,Travis,,,"I find the comments given as examples of the ""blowback"" against the post very typical of programmers and fairly revealing.<p>First, does anyone doubt the value of learning Ruby is much greater than $2,800?  I imagine the course is targeted at someone without any programming experience[1], which only increases its value.<p>Second, not everyone can teach themselves to code.  It's an easy trap for us programmers to fall into, since we can often pick material up on our own.  But we do call it ""code"" for a reason -- this is difficult stuff!<p>Third, many objections focus on the high price of the course.  That's absurd -- it only establishes a higher value on the skillset those programmers already possess!  We clamor for managers and sales people to just learn to program a little bit -- one way of conveying that value is to capture more of it in the training programs.<p>Fourth, these courses are just an option.  Their existence doesn't threaten all the awesome free Rails courses out there.<p>It strikes me as a little bit of trademen unions.  As if we want new programmers to pass the ""self taught"" trial by fire initiation ritual.<p>[1]I also understand the objection to the forum in which this course was offered; however, the primary objections in the article seemed to be focused on the cost of the course, rather than the manner in which it was advertised.<p>(edit, formatting)",1325048075

A day later, the speed of the rock has reached 0.5c.<p>Hours later, a defending fleet arrives, shoots and kills all the invading b<i></i><i></i><i>ds. The rock however, continues at 0.5c even though the thruster and guidance systems were destroyed. It reaches the asteroid cluster, and hits... nothing. It keeps going to the other side of the solar system, and as its speed was so high, exits orbit.<p>Accelerating a giant rock to c takes throwing out </i>alot* of gas. The asteroid based civilisation, to prevent random impacts with random asteroids, would've been tracking every object in the belt. One of the rocks suddenly accelerates, I think it will be picked up.<p>Also, when the asteroid was accelerating, its direction would've been picked up. Once accelerated to c, it will still take hours to arrive at the designated target. The home asteroids simply have to maneuvre away from an intercept course. And no, guidance systems on the accelerated rock won't help. It's travelling at c, and by the time the system finds out the target has moved away, the asteroid would've missed it. Unless the asteroid have 100% maneuverability, and energy to change course whenever, however it likes. But if the asteroid can do that, any asteroid can do that. ;)<p>So your only option is accelerating the rock from the next system onwards. It will now take years for the asteroid to arrive. To reduce the probability of a successful attack, just have a ""random thruster day"" every 30 days where all the home asteroids just move randomly to different locations. By the time the enemy asteroid arrives the location of all the home asteroids would've been different. The probability of hitting anything worth hitting will be very low. Even if you have 1000 incoming asteroids.<p>Also you're assuming you won't get picked up accelerating an asteroid to c in the next system; Remember, asteroids have no atmosphere and 100% visibility. You might miss 1, but 1000? I'd doubt it. if 1000 asteroids are really incoming then you just make every day random thruster day. ;) They have so much energy, you should too.",1325047672

FTA this means everything is easily trackable, not only are thrusters visible from across the solar system (except perhaps if you're headed directly for someone, but the thrust required there would be insane), but even every object in the solar system is glowing in infrared energy and thats background objects, not to mention you've strapped nuclear power plants, life support and whatever other heat producing apparatus onto your ship to make it glow even brighter.<p>The problem with being visible from a distance means it favours those who can hide. Basically, it favours mines. It's simple strap a laser onto a small rock, bury capacitors inside it and have them charged by solar panels. Why? Because the aim is to one-shot your target somewhere important. The mine is disposable, if it one shots the target you might get lucky enough to use it twice. If not you'll have dozens of others waiting. You've got 3 targets: Power supply (nuclear reactor/capacitor bank/whatever), main engine (you cripple their thrust and they're a sitting duck) and control centre (heck, you're likely able to nail all habitable space in one shot as a space ship is more likely to have a vastly expanded cockpit rather than a whole ship of habitable space)<p>The other problem with space combat is heat. Before you'd even fire a missile or a bullet, you're going to be aiming infrared lasers on your targets from light minutes away. If a ship is habitated then you only need to get it to the point where the life support can't shift enough heat to keep the air temperature below 40C. In uncrewed ships you're talking hot enough to make processors malfunction, which isn't considerably hotter than people can tolerate. These might cope better as cooling can be dedicated to very small areas.<p>The problem with space is that objects can get very hot, very fast and unless you bring a lot of material to heat sink and dump, you've got problems.<p>Space will be a war predominated with mines and heat. There are currently about 25,000 objects in space. If only 1% of these are ship-killer mines, would you attack Earth? Well, you'd need more than 250 ships, assuming you're able to kill all the mines in a very short time before they can refire.<p>Want to attack a mining base in the asteroid field? Find the rock without the massive laser hiding in it! Furthermore, try to wage an effective assault when you're pulverizing everything within a million kilometers of you, and still have the weapons/energy/heat sink capability to fight your target that has a massive rock of shielding and heat sinking, versus your ship.<p>What about launching asteroids or comets at your target? Well 1 if it's viable to nudge an asteroid from hitting earth, then it's viable to nudge the asteroid your in so that it's missed.",1325046422

Jobs found talented people who were already alienated, like Jonny Ive, and talked them into building entire companies for him.<p>Shockley's employees are famous for the things they created at other companies. Jobs' employees are famous for the things they created while working for him.<p>According to this documentary, Shockley tanked his company because he insisted on pursuing a brilliant and original idea, the Shockley PNPN diode, even though it was unmanufacturable at the time. Steve Jobs, despite his reputation as some sort of spacey visionary, proclaimed that ""real artists ship"". Though he took a long view of the industry and was willing to tinker for years on pet projects until they met his standards, he also built teams that <i>shipped</i> real products like the Mac and the iPod. Indeed, shipping was Jobs' real skill: He didn't invent the Apple I or the mouse or the GUI or the MP3, and he didn't even personally build Apple's versions of any of these things, but he figured out ways to get them into customers' hands. And the modern Apple revival is largely predicated on a relentlessly pragmatic focus on operational detail.<p>Shockley was, infamously, an outspoken eugenicist and racist who stated that his theories on intelligence would be his most important legacy. In public, Steve Jobs was apolitical and talked only about his work, doing so only rarely, and mostly on stage.<p>Shockley died an elderly but lonely man, estranged from all but his second wife.

I've previously used other people's config files, skeleton apps, etc. when attempting to learn new technologies, and I always ended up regretting it. With Emacs I started from scratch and took only what I needed from other people's setups. This worked very well for me.<p>I don't know if you have any interest in using Org mode, but I'd like to mention that using Org mode to create a personal wiki has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. I previously had hundreds of files (.txt, .doc, .xls, etc.) containing notes for the subjects I've studied, and these files weren't interlinked like wiki pages, nor could they be converted to HTML and published to the web with a single command. Sharing knowledge with my team and family is so efficient now. I can't recommend Org mode enough for notetaking.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://orgmode.org/manual/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orgmode.org/manual/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryDotEmacs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryDotEmacs</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/search?type=Repositories&q=Emacs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/search?type=Repositories&q=Emacs</a>",1325044961

He has a whole world full of things to worry about and only 365 days a year. When something so important to you such as SOPA arrives on his desk, he probably is forced to paint with very broad strokes. Should I be strong on IP, weak on IP? Does my party support it? The specific long term effects that so many of us fear probably don't even cross his mind.",1325044861

Our brains evolved for taking in spatial information and manipulating 3D objects, after all.<p>There are domains where visual programming is common (i.e. Control in Simulink, Data acquisition in Labview, pure data in audio), but they are domains where you don&#x27;t really need to scale the complexity of the code, so the parts of the ecosystem that enable scalability (i.e. automatic and deterministic formatting of the visual representation of the code, version control) are underdeveloped.",1449493032

So Scala gives you a 10x faster cycle during early development. Maybe it&#x27;s fast enough that you don&#x27;t need that last factor of 2, or maybe just JNIing a few core operations is enough (you can also do some tricks with the advanced type system; with NumPy if it looks like Python iteration then it is, whereas with something like Breeze you can potentially have something that looks like Scala iteration but won&#x27;t actually copy the data back and forth).

I&#x27;d say the main bottlenecks are monetary, political and cultural. Doctors are often set in their ways, and hospital management staff are risk-averse.  Moreover, because of legal liability issues, a lot of this stuff has not been formally approved for clinical use -- so hospitals won&#x27;t touch it. This is especially true of the open-source software. Getting approved is an expensive and time-consuming process. Service contracts with approved software are expensive, mostly as a result of this.<p>Heck, look at the struggle involved in digital patient records, which is supposedly a simpler problem than imaging.

Yes, often at a desk, but also in the field or in a theater monitoring recording or playback.<p>What I look for is simple: comfort, durability, isolation (in both directions), neutrality. In that order.<p>Comfort - I swear by circumaural designs. Some people apparently don&#x27;t have a problem with pads resting on the pinna, but I find this painful after an hour or two. Isolation is also worse with supra-aural designs.<p>Durability - most headphones break quickly. The cables are usually the first to go, around the strain relief on either end. I&#x27;ve had some pairs that used a 1/8&quot; minijack on one of the earpieces, making the cable replaceable - until the jack failed and couldn&#x27;t be replaced without breaking open the earpiece. Good headphones will survive any reasonable drop; really good ones will survive being drop-kicked.<p>Isolation - if you can&#x27;t hear the signal over environmental noise, why bother monitoring? If you&#x27;re recording or working in a theatrical environment, you don&#x27;t want your headset audio leaking out either. In an office setting, nobody wants to hear your music, no matter how awesoem your jams are. Closed-ear designs are the way to go.<p>Neutrality - Relatively flat frequency response. But this is way down the list of priorities for me. A great sounding set of headphones that breaks after 2 months, or is uncomfortable to wear, or doesn&#x27;t block the sound of your workstation&#x27;s fans is not a great set of headphones.<p>tl;dr - Beyerdynamic DT250 is my headset of choice. My current pair is almost 15 years old and the only thing that&#x27;s failed on them is the pleather on the headband, which has fallen off its fabric backing. Still on the original earpads and cable, and they&#x27;re as good as the day I bought them. Stay away from consumer brands and models; like fast-fashion clothes, they are not built to last.<p>(This is also why you should buy your cookware from a restaurant supply store, not williams-sonoma.)",1449490165

Or an expensive check that always triggers on all concurrent access. As far as I can see in the java HashMap source, the concurrent modification check is actually only done for the enumerator (?) so the problem of multiple concurrent insertions, or even reading-while-inserting will never be caught anyway. Just like Go, or .NET.<p>A check for single thread access (which is even stricter than non-concurrent access which allows several threads as long as they aren&#x27;t used concurrently) would be pretty cheap: store the thread ID on creation and then verify on reads and writes.<p>Failing on concurrent access otherwise on all reads and writes would basically mean that you add a lock to the write operation, and fail any reads while anyone is writing.

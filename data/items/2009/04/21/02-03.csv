571797,comment,571303,571386,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Yes, I know what Churchill said about democracy.</i><p>Funny enough, Churchill did not say what people think he said about democracy.  He said, ""it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time;""  In other words, he was para-phrasing his opponents.  Churchill was actually giving a speech defending the existence of the House of Lords! ( <a href=""http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0105/0105churchilldem.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0105/0105chu...</a> )<p>And while Churchill's misquote is famous, few have heard of Gibbon's quote:<p>--------------------------<p>OF the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule. Is it possible to relate, without an indignant smile, that, on the father's decease, the property of a nation, like that of a drove of oxen, descends to his infant son, as yet unknown to mankind and to himself; and that the bravest warriors and the wisest statesmen, relinquishing their natural right to empire, approach the royal cradle with bended knees and protestations of inviolable fidelity? Satire and declamation may paint these obvious topics in the most dazzling colors, but our more serious thoughts will respect a useful prejudice, that establishes a rule of succession, independent of the passions of mankind; and we shall cheerfully acquiesce in any expedient which deprives the multitude of the dangerous, and indeed the ideal, power of giving themselves a master. In the cool shade of retirement, we may easily devise imaginary forms of government, in which the sceptre shall be constantly bestowed on the most worthy, by the free and incorrupt suffrage of the whole community. Experience overturns these airy fabrics, and teaches us that, in a large society, the election of a monarch can never devolve to the wisest, or to the most numerous, part of the people.<p>----------------------------------------<p>In other words, the principle of hereditary rule may be ridiculous, but it's the best way to keep the monsters out of power.  And note, after Gibbon wrote this quote, many European countries proceeded to cast away their monarchs and elect monsters ( Robespierre, Napoleon, the Bolsheviks, Hitler, etc).",1240280126

It's going to be modest, but you're a startup, so ""We'll pay for your lunch, and give you enough money to rent a place with roommates,"" is enough.<p>2) Instead of ownership of revenue, give people ownership in the properties they create. Getting 10% of something questionable is okay, but being in charge of whatever new, successful lines of business you create is great.<p>3) Drop the '12 months' line. Tell people that you're looking for folks who can create good sites, and that if they can do it in a few months, you'll bring them on board full-time. A cut of revenue might be the right way to do things, but it makes you sound like an affiliate marketer masquerading as an internship, rather than an internship with a novel compensation scheme.",1240279967

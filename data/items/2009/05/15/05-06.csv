But to capitalise on IM, and to use fullstops, now seems overly formal to me, inappropriate in casual conversation with friends.<p>It's quite fascinating, really, how these things develop. For example:<p><pre><code>  friend: seen reddit today?\n  me: no # <-- devoid of further meaning, a neutral tone\n  me: No. # <-- overbearing and formal, almost a put-down:\n        ""No, of course not.

Fats are good, then fats are bad, then they are good again.

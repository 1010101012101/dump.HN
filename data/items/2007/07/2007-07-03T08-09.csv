Out of all the retail vendors, I have the cheapest price.<p>If a new wholesale vendor were to enter the market, that wholesaler would be able to make a great deal of money very quickly.",1183452608

32227,comment,32208,32221,0,0,rms,,,"Thanks, I really appreciate your advice.<p>I put the site up without doing a lot of consideration to the marketing, which is a challange. I put it up because Kratom is an extraordinarily profitable product for sellers.<p>The supplier enforced price floor means that I am not operating on a razor thin price margin. It's close to 100% profit margin. I need not fear someone undercutting me.<p>Kratom is not an incense, though it can be smoked. I recognize it is confusing, but the current vendors of Kratom claim it is an incense and sold for those purposes only. Kratom is an opiate comparable in strength to hydrocodone. In smaller doses it is stimulating, providing a mental boost similar to caffeine but without the jittery side effects. The main medical uses would be opiate withdrawal, chronic pain management, and treatment of ADHD. Traditionally, workers would chew the leaves of Kratom but now is usually boiled into a tea. If you add a lot of sweetener, it even tastes good. It is high in antioxidants, containing much more than brewed green tea.<p>The active alkaloid, 6-hydroxy-mitragynine is 30 times more powerful than morphine by weight.<p>However, I can't tell people that kratom is a drug on my site because it is probably illegal to say so. If I told people that 10 grams of kratom leaf is comparable to 20 miligrams of hydrocodone, I would be selling a drug without FDA approval. Paypal would also ban my account because they want no part of this business. There have been Kratom vendors that made claims about Kratom's use as an opiate on their website that had shipments of Kratom seized by customs. I have spoken to one of the larger retail vendors of Kratom who strongly recommended only referring to Kratom as an incense.<p>If I was legally allowed to market Kratom as a drug, I would. It's a potent painkiller that doesn't make you tired or slow you down. There is certainly a commercial market for a new, natural opiate but I'm not allowed to bring something like that to market in the USA.<p><p>
It's a bit of a catch-22 -- if I tell people it's a drug, everyone will want it but I can't tell people it's actually a drug. What I really need here is legal advice telling me exactly what I can and can't say about Kratom, but without legal advice I'm afraid to do any more than give people the tools to find the information for themselves. Does anyone know a lawyer that could offer a qualified view on my business?<p><p>I am competing on price and only able to sell to those that already know what Kratom is, unless there's an angle I'm missing here. I've been selling on eBay for a while and a website was the logical way to increase volume. I have some passionate customers, including one who advocated for me on a chronic pain management support group. Most of my customers just email me requesting a PayPal invoice for their Kratom. If I could pull some SEO magic and be highly rated for kratom keywords, this business would be profitable.<p>Until then, I'm just going to advertise online. Where should I advertise besides Google Adwords?",1183450487

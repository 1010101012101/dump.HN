Sometimes, you're gunna need it. Say YAGNI to everything, and you'll never create meaningful reusable abstractions.

If you have someone working for $10 an hour, that is 5,000 hours or 2.5 years payback on the robot. And the robot is far less flexible (and $50k is a super low number). When you have 3-10 year pay off on a robot, why would you do it?<p>Robots really aren't built for menial tasks. Where do you see robots in the auto industry? Painting and welding. Painting is a skill job. Welding is a skill job. A good painter or welder is not making far off of what an entry level coder is making (if you don't believe me, find out how much it costs to weld oil pipeline or ship structure). They didn't take over Detroit to displace cheap labor, they did it to increase quality. The reasons for automation are usually increasing quality or doing something humans physically can't (speed, precision, strength etc). Rarely do you see it worthwhile to replace a human with a robot for a menial hand task.<p>So no, McDonalds will not be taken over by robots. The economics of it just don't make sense.",1293350031

2040269,comment,2040245,2040245,0,0,lfborjas,,,"Hi there! You seem to know your stuff, or at least <i>like</i> it (in a computer scientific sense), so I have only a couple of things to say: first, if you've already written socket and networking software, you could be better off starting with ""raw"" web development frameworks (or no framework at all, writing a tiny web server could be a really cool challenge: <a href=""http://docs.racket-lang.org/more/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/more/</a> ), to get the knack of how a web-app works, without all those layers of specialization interfering: try to write something in flask or sinatra, or even in ruby's ""rack"" or it's python equivalent, to be familiar with the http request-response cycle and how the different moving parts (building html with css and javascript, interacting with file systems and databases and network operations) really work and why is it that frameworks exist (which boilerplate code they do for you). Since you know javascript, you could also check out node.js, which is raw enough. And <i>then</i>, when you've got how is it that web development works in its guts, you can move on to more easy going stuff, like rails, pylons, django or whatever.<p>The second thing is, although someone else might say that scheme sucks for not having lots of libraries, I've found it very eye opening, specially by watching -and reading- the lectures in MIT's ""structure and science of computer programs"" (here it is in ocw: <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-comput...</a> , videos and book are free), if you go through them and thrive to get it, you'll be doing yourself a great service, learning funtional programming, no matter what language it is, will make you a good programmer, because it will force you to think not in terms or how to make stuff easy for the computer, but in how to make stuff ""elegant"" and easy for yourself, the programmer (kinda like when you do math and it ""feels just right""). I personally have found myself to be a better -more productive- python programmer by learning scheme with the SICP course and how to write javascript in the functional style.<p>Godspeed in your studies, CS is a great thing to study :)",1293348993

You're arguing against him instead of me.<p>> <i>""Everyone is equipped to participate, barring exceptionally low IQ.""</i><p>This is extremely wishful thinking with no evidence to back it up. The incentives for training oneself for a job in the information economy is huge today, yet only half of Americans have completed any college coursework.[1] If all of the people doing menial tasks today are capable of doing more intellectual work, why are they ignoring the incentives that exist today to get them to do so?<p>> <i>""Big projects typically require capital investment, but so what?

2040255,comment,2039503,2039777,0,0,Daishiman,,,"I disagree completely about 'what you can make'. This only applies to a few extremely qualified positions in the workforce.<p>The large majority of jobs, while they do require a level of intellect, which may be at times large, are nowadays less dependent on individual thought and more about being able to follow processes and procedures, to the point where the skills themselves are mere commodities and original thought is not needed unless we're talking about the higher echelons of a company.<p>I can't find the NYT article on the matter, but I can describe my experience as a systems administrator:\nWhile in theory Unix sysadmins are highly qualified people who should be thinking independently, I left the line of work largely because of the extreme tediousness and lack of independence.<p>- 90% of the tasks that had to be done were extremely trivial but their automation had already been maximized (adding users in heterogenous systems, altering filesystems, touching files and installing software)<p>- Most nontrivial errors were deferred to support lines. Decisions on how to proceed with most ""important"" issues were left up to project executives and people with no technical qualifications.<p>- Most change issues were managed through tickets which had a list of steps to follow to the implementer. Most of the work there consisted of chasing the proper approvers so that I could do the work for them on time.<p>What was left was a highly predictable, boring system where all the originality and intelligence was made at the procedure level, and we were expected to follow procedure at all times, even when it was not necessarily the best choice.<p>Corporations do not generally want an inspired rank-and-file. Intelligent individuals want to question and are willing to make mistakes, and this clashes with organizations that want to automate what cannot be automated at a fundamental level. My skill set was reduced to just knowing the commands and locations to do stuff; creative problem determination was discarding as being dangerous and disrupting, and even though there were a hundred different ways to improve processes, the bureaucracy to do that made it an incovenience that I was not willing to put up with.<p>Thankfully I left that position for places that did require much deeper through and rewarded creativity, but the reality is that a large chunk of work simply doesn't require that; some jobs have a ceiling as to how productive one can be, and IMO, the current trend of making everything dependent on processes doesn't help in bringing the best out of people.<p>Think about this on retail jobs and food services: interaction with the customers is scripted at incredibly deep levels with little margin for the person to make his or her best judgement. The problem is that not everyone is in a condition to leave and operate their own establishment or find better positions, so we have a large mass of people whose skills are being purposely underutilized.",1293348407

Your interlocutors were probably just doing as they were trained. The Jehovah's Witness church is in many ways a sales organization.<p>When I was around, they did't have the wealth or intellectual sophistication to advertise themselves effectively. We had been using the same sales book for years and I wouldn't be surprised if ""the reasoning book"" is still around. An organization that enforces orthodoxy as thoroughly as Jehovah's Witnesses isn't exactly a breeding ground for creative and entrepreneurial spirits.<p>I wouldn't expect them to pivot if hard sales techniques proved to be annoying or ineffective. They used to publish their conversion statistics in the January 1st or 15th edition of The Watchtower so you could follow their growth (an anemic 1% or so per year back in the late 90s). That was a shockingly transparent move for such a close-minded organization; it probably helps increase members trust in the central organization.

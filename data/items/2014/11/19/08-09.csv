It took work to get to category theory, thousands of years of it.  Also, if the human mind didn&#x27;t contain <i>some</i> small kernel of ability to accurately generalize from the real world, it wouldn&#x27;t <i>function</i> as a living creature&#x27;s mind, so we can trust, in the sense of a proof of existence, that evolution built us to reason correctly <i>sometimes</i>.",1416387467

Closed Source strips me of that option.<p>Closed source does not strip you of the ability to audit.<p>In the case of BitTorrent Sync you can use Wireshark to inspect the network traffic yourself. BitTorrent even goes so far as to purposefully use plaintext for the usage statistics it reports back so that someone could cross-verify with Wireshark. \nBesides Wireshark there&#x27;s all sorts of tools for instrumenting, debugging, or decompiling Sync that would also fall within the realm of auditing.<p>As other commenters have noted, it is not exactly trivial to verify that a binary for some open source software was produced by the same open source code you audited. This leaves you with having to compile from source everything – which seems only an order of magnitude or so less annoying than Wireshark-ing or IDA-ing everything.<p>Perhaps a better approach to handling the security concerns of open vs. closed source software would be to take a more active approach to locking down what we run. Lets operate with the working assumption that whatever we run is hostile instead of having blind trust in open source.\nLets use firewalls, containerization, selinux, etc. to essentially configure whitelists for what we allow of the software we run.<p>For someone that doesn&#x27;t trust BitTorrent Sync because it&#x27;s not open source consider locking it down. Use a firewall to only allow connections to known peers, isolate it from other processes, and restrict filesystem access. Trade some usability for security.<p>The kinds of things y&#x27;all are concerned about with BitTorrent Sync are the same things we should be just as concerned about for what we just apt-get&#x27;d; closed source vs. open source doesn&#x27;t make a lick of difference in that respect.",1416387176

8628941,comment,8626826,8628443,0,0,yongers,,,"As a South Korean, I find it hard to completely agree with the above statement. It is true that the desire for unification is not as strong as they were.. say.. 30 years ago. As you have pointed out, the younger generation in particular, have no experience of a unified korean peninsula and are not as eager for a unified Korea. But to say that Koreans &quot;don&#x27;t want&quot; a unified Korea while the &quot;the world wants them to unite&quot; is a gross misrepresentation.<p>Just for the sake of correctness, a quick google search will reveal that a significant proportion (often majority) of the Korean population still feel that reunification should take place (as an example, according to Asan Institute this figure was at 63.5% as of April 2014). I hasten to add however that the younger generations (those that are below 40) are significantly less eager. Another thing to realise is that majority of Koreans do NOT consider North Koreans as an enemy. In fact (quoting again from the figures released by Asan Institute), 77.6% of the Korean population had either positive (43.8%) or neutral (23.8%) stance towards North Korea.<p>The road to Korean unification is a difficult one for sure. I cannot disagree with the comment that some of the issues regarding Korean unification lie with the South Korean attitude towards North Korea. But, as many have mentioned, there are other powers at work here too. Chinese and US interests (as well as that of Russia and Japan to a lesser extent) are major stumbling blocks that neither South Korean nor the North Korean governments can ignore.<p>Being a South Korean, it is my single greatest dream to see a unified Korea. It is painful to see that there are those from my own country that do not feel the same way. It is even more painful to see how powerless we are to shape our own country&#x27;s destiny. Throughout history, Korea (unified or not) has often been used as a political pawn by its stronger neighbours. I hope, and pray, that things turn out somewhat differently and that both Koreas can unify peacefully to end this status quo.",1416387157

Let&#x27;s say the police ignore this and go around secretly scanning cities without a warrant.  They find out that John is growing weed in his basement, but they can&#x27;t arrest him because this evidence is inadmissible.  They follow John for a while and see that he interacts with Pete.  Pete has a warrant out on him based on some unpaid parking tickets.  So the cops arrest Pete, find weed, and get him to finger John as the source.

Since before Uber there are many taxi companies with their own Uber-like service and taxi brokers similar to Uber.  I know of people who switched company or broker based on statements the owner of the one company made on radio about cyclists.  When Uber is new in town it is a &#x27;cool&#x27; thing to do, but once they are not so new people find reasons to change.  This makes for an interesting and dynamic market.

At Amazon, however, employees from the warehouse stockers to their receptionists are under contract and regulation, and get guaranteed wages for reasonable hours. Compare this to Uber where there&#x27;s basically a massive disparity between the number of effective workers (drivers + employees) and the number of actual &#x27;employees&#x27;. As a bystander, I&#x27;m worried about the humans involved in this bet between Uber/Lyft and co, and hope they start finding ways to either pull drivers into the company itself, or offer better guarantees or securities for the drivers. The first company to do this will probably get a ton of good press, and will also up the ante on consumer perception of ridesharing in general (it&#x27;s great, but feels &#x27;evil&#x27;).",1416384724

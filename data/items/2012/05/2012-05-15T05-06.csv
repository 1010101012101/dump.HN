That's not true. The first time I did it, it took me something like 10 minutes. I must say that I was already familiar enough with Eclipse to install the plugin without much struggling (though it can't get any easier, unless it came built-in). Beginners should also try out IntelliJ IDEA which comes with Android integration built-in.<p><pre><code>     The Apple dance takes a couple minutes to

That's also not true. It took me somewhere between 2 and 3 hours. And you don't have to pay $99 for getting the Hello World on your phone, but you do have to fuck around with certificates for signing the binary and you also have to read a lot of documentation.",1337061543

Public transportation is radically faster than cars, at least in any city with a fraction of the same population. Have you ever tried to drive through Atlanta or Miami? And living in an urban environment doesn't demand high-rise towers -- walkable townhouses and height-restricted buildings abound, and there's no shortage of human-friendly neighborhoods in New York. (I also hate midtown Manhattan, but that's nowhere near representative of city living.)<p>If you absolutely need a car for big purchases, Zipcar and its competitors are easily accessible. If you're older, you have BETTER options here in the form of delivery services than you'd have in a rural setting.

I was actually thinking of the local rail system, the MTR.  Taking a taxi anywhere or driving yourself is almost always faster than taking the MTR.<p>By it's very nature, public transport, which has to run on a schedule and leave gaps between runs to allow passengers to accumulate and then make multiple stops is, is often going to be slower than an individual getting into a personal vehicle and driving themselves to their destination.<p>> You're tilting at a straw man.

Since this area carries prestige from Stanford and the tech industry its expensive. Always has been.

The crap I overpay for at most restaurants downtown is insane. Coming from NYC, I had far more options and better food for cheaper. Why? Size. Competition, sure...But also no bubble. Ladies and gentlemen we are in the middle of another tech bubble here. Prices are outrageous and companies are over valued. So it'd the cost. That's why. People do their best to find places to live and they over extend themselves. I know doctors (both husband and wife) who are struggling. A nice profession...Still not enough.

All those shopping centers and apartments named after man-made formations of fruit trees are because, well, there used to be a lot of those trees there a few decades ago.<p>In four short decades, we have developed the land to the point where, as others here have mentioned, ""no more open land"" to be easily developed. We are now faced with a choice: do we develop further? If so, to what end, and for whom? What are the costs?<p>But first we must consider, who is the <i>""we""</i> in my queries above? Whose interests should be considered? The long time residents of the Valley? The young, vibrant, restless newcomers?<p>Understandably and naturally, there is friction. There is tension. The old timers already have what they need: a comfortable single family home with a family to fill its corridors. Why would they or should they allow others to disturb their peace and comfort that they worked so hard for? They fight to protect the space and luxury they feel entitled to, and arguably are.<p>The newcomers find it increasingly difficult to not only find such an abode, but to find even a reasonably priced rental until located within a reasonable distance from their offices. Understandably and naturally, they pine for amenities that are well within reach for others their age in other parts of the country. They rightfully feel that <i>they</i> are entitled to what they need: reasonable living arrangements.<p>Both sides have legitimate arguments. Silicon Valley is a beautiful place, and it would be a shame to turn it into a concrete jungle. But on the other hand, there is an undeniable generation inequality with respect to real estate: real estate prices in Palo Alto only declined by about 15% during the worst times of the financial crisis, and have most likely reached new heights by now. Every year, it becomes more difficult to find affordable housing, particularly near the mega-employers like Google. The year over year increase in rent in Mountain View is in excess of 10%. Only the privileged amongst the youth can afford the slim pickings that are available, as the rent is enough to crush the savings of more modestly salaried engineers.<p>Who is right? It is more of a generation divide than a class divide. I sympathize and empathize with both sides, being both a young, modestly compensated professional in the tech sector, and also the son of immigrants to Silicon Valley who sacrificed a monstrous portion of their lives to attain the little that they have to show for it. Whichever way the ball rolls, I'm in line for both pain and pleasure.<p>""We"", both the old and the young, are both <i>right</i> to lay claim to what we believe should be rightfully ours. Such a situation does not have a simple, elegant solution. But we can at least start by acknowledging to each other that yes, you are completely justified to want what you want.",1337059739

Starting a company was far more interesting than going to school at the time, and still is.  When I went back, I decided to go as fast as I could, because I wanted to get it over with, fully aware that there wasn't much to learn from earlier experience.<p>There were some instructive classes.  I had a professor that was passionate about assembly, and another that I had for several classes, that gave me an FPGA board and told me I could build whatever I wanted, and he would grade me on that, since the coursework would be very easy for me.  I built a basic processor, with an assembly language I devised, which was more instructive than anything I ever actually did in a class.  The vast majority, however, were not worth much.<p>What's interesting is that I was interested enough in the subject to learn tons about it on my own over the course of more than a decade.  A couple years of institutional bullshit was enough to change that.  Today, I'd much prefer to do Udacity or Coursera courses than go to an actual school.  At least I can study exactly what I want, and the assignments are well thought out.<p><i>Every year I get a number of students whose entire motivation to be in my class is that they want to get the piece of paper. This sort of purely extrinsic motivation does not tend to make them very good students (although occasionally I have one that does well and gets an A, good for them). I'm always a little disappointed in them, because the class is more fun for both of us if they're more internally motivated; sometimes I can manage to get them actually interested, and then they perk up and are happier (and often do better), but sometimes they've just decided that they're not going to like college, and you know what? I can't force them to.</i><p>Doesn't that really depend on the material.  I flipped through some of the assignments you have on your website, and while you do have some interesting assignments, you also have stuff like Homework 5 in your sys admin class, where the student has to use traceroute to learn about the topology of the school's network.  I am certain I could have done that assignment in 6th or 7th grade without difficulty.  If I had to do it now, I would absolutely hate it.  It is a fine assignment for students that have never troubleshot a networking issue, but if you have any experience whatsoever, its simply tedious and not particularly instructive.  Nobody is going to be motivated by tedious easy assignments.<p><i>In my class, and in those of my colleagues who have not overinflated their grades, As are gotten by the students who impress us with their outstanding work. Part of that is, of course, making sure they do all the pieces (don't skip anything, make sure it all works, check your work, etc), and the smart-but-sloppy students who skip things tend to be my A- and B+ students rather than my A students. But the students whose primary priority is checking everything off on a checklist, just ""doing everything"", rather than ""getting it"" or ""making a cool thing"" or whatever, almost invariably don't succeed in getting the A.</i><p>I believe that you sincerely believe this.  I sincerely believe it is not true.  Checking boxes is indistinguishable from outstanding work, by your metrics.  Somebody that is checking a checkbox by definition won't miss anything, the truly interested student is more likely to deeply explore one area and go lightly on another, becoming the A- or B+ student.

I call it 'binary' because they are either in complete control (""code to my spec you powerless device OEMS!"") or at the mercy of Apple (""hey XYZ carrier -- my way or the highway""). Notice that in both of these situations, there's very little leeway for maneuvering.<p>Android comes along. Carriers hate Apple's way of doing business. Brain-dead analysis shows that Android didn't have the brand cachet that iPhones had. So naturally they wanted to re-exert their control back into the process. 
Unfortunately, the only way they knew how was by (probably literally) throwing the book (read: terminal specs) back to Android OEMs.<p>And so, you now have the current situation of:<p>1) Fragmentation; and 
2) Slow firmware updates.<p>Carriers don't have the funding, organization and/or willpower to subsidize firmware updates.<p><i>The upgrade process for the OS on a smart phone should be multiple times over the course of a year and yet it seems that there is often only a single update.</i><p>This sentiment echos a portion of Android consumers. Yes,  it's a big problem. But the rapid plethora of devices released by Android device manufacturers demonstrate that they are <i>also</i> operating using old processes and risk-benefit models because they simply want to sell as many devices as they can to carriers.<p>In short, the article title is misleading: <i>everybody</i> in the mobile ecosystem is responsible for the fragmentation, mainly for what I see as large organizations unable to change their terminal approval and release cycles enough to cope.",1337058973

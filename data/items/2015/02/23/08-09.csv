I have seen devs move into a pure architect role but as time goes on it does become apparent that they need to be closer to the detail.<p>I think the definition of architecture should be a dev team effort with the architect role making the final decision (be that lead dev, CTO, whatever job title for that person).<p>I like the idea suggested in the thread of making the architect a product team/project role.",1424681854

Really, there&#x27;s no such thing as luck?<p>I was born in a wealthy country, to sane and supportive parents. I was born with a talent for mathematics and technology, and am reasonably intelligent. I had a family that encouraged learning. With the exception of some run-ins with addiction and mood disorders, I still have my health, despite my best efforts to destroy it while an addict. I am sober now partly because of the efforts of others.<p>I have managed to grab onto some awesome opportunities that have rolled past now that I&#x27;m healthier, and am currently working at a shockingly successful startup, but it was not strictly my own doing.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with what I think you&#x27;re really getting at -  take opportunities that present themselves, &quot;luck is when preparation meets opportunity&quot;, don&#x27;t wait around for things to happen, make them happen, and so on.

9093279,comment,9092567,9092891,0,0,dwenzek,,,"Yes, there is a risk to be boastful. But the risk is shared by many positions and roles. It&#x27;s not enough to say I&#x27;m an architect or a full stack developer or UX designer, there are a lot of skills and attitudes to have along the days to fill plainly the role in a team.<p>It&#x27;s why, I totally agree the post. To fulfill the architect role, you have to be on a daily basis with the team, to design, develop and debug with them. This is not about being a Rockstar, but yes, this requires some broader and smarter vision on how the whole system is being developed. And this implies responsibilities too and even a bit of humility when things do not go like expected: it is at these difficult times that we can judge whether you deserved the role.<p>Besides, titles have their importance. This is maybe a pity, but, for sure, you don&#x27;t have the same audience from the management when you are introduced as a software architect rather as a developer. Same thing, when you are looking for a job. I&#x27;m a freelance developer with 20 years of experiment and I introduce myself as a software architect even if I&#x27;m looking for contracts where I will be plainly involved in development tasks. Each time I failed to do so, I put myself in situation with no chances to use my skills and to help the project at the level I could have. On the contrary, with an architect hat, I have been often welcome with some suspicion (&quot;how can this guy fix the mess we&#x27;re in?&quot;), but this gave me the opportunity to work effectively with all team members and to truly help them.",1424681804

Freedom of speech isn&#x27;t freedom from consequences, and there very well could be public backlash for this, or any other comment. Private organizations can enforce consequences on employees or stakeholders for falling outside their prescribed internal policies. Also, saying generally offensive things can certainly alienate somebody in society or professionally. I don&#x27;t think this particular case the joke went too far and was certainly written by the oscar comedy writers and probably not by Harris himself.<p>To your other point, on a private platform people certainly have the right to deem what is acceptable communication.

With web you&#x27;re at the mercy of third-party scripts and browsers.<p>- Native is much more energy efficient compared to web apps. You can do a whole lot more with much less power and resources.<p>- Native apps are incredibly secure compared to web apps. Unless holes and backdoors were purposefully designed in it, a native app will just run on your desktop. A web app goes through a browser, maybe some extensions, your network, an ISP and finally some third-party servers.<p>- Native code is easier to maintain because there are fewer things that can go wrong as time goes by.

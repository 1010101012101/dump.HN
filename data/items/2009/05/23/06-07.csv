623220,comment,622858,622982,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"I've been using Ritalin, not Adderall. Here's my experience:<p>I started on Ritalin 15 years ago or so.  At first, I found myself oddly calm and rational, even at what struck me as really inappropriate times (such as during an emotional conversation with my wife).  Like I became Mr. Spock.<p>Then I noticed that my personal soundtrack disappeared.   There was <i>always</i> music running though my head.  Assorted, pop-ish, catchy melodies.  And they were <i>gone</i>. Sadness.<p>I think I stopped taken it then, but shortly later went back on it.  The effects were not as striking.  (The soundtrack returned, hooray! and has not left again since then.)<p>Nowadays, I find hard to say how well it works.  I more or less take it when I feel like it, and I think it helps, but it seems I've acclimated.  (Side note: I'm pretty sure the Ritalin, plus Wellbutrin, were key to my quitting smoking.   Take note, all you stimulant-chasing dopamine-deprived chain smokers.)<p>On the other hand, years ago I felt as though there was a TV in my head and someone was changing the channel every second. That's gotten <i>much</i> better. But on-demand focus, still not so good.<p>Now I wonder if I should try Adderall.  I did a stint with Strattera, but it didn't seem to do much.<p>Meanwhile, I'm writing possibly commercial apps to help me stay organized, so maybe there's an upside. :)",1243060933

But it didn't seem deliberate, just a casual and unconscious going-with-the-flow put-down of java. As axon said, many people do it. I was struck by your preface + the following statement:<p><i>My statements that I prefer Arc for the kind of programming I do was not intended to be a put-down of other languages.</i><p><i>If you should be so unfortunate to be stuck trying to write good code in Java, ...</i><p>One solution is to remove the connotations, eg:<p><i>If you are writing code in Java, ...</i><p>Note: this version is more concise :-)<p>But please keep the factual points, such that Java's verbosity can mean that removing duplication doesn't make it shorter. I thought that was an insightful and pithy expression of the idea. But I also note that that's not the only benefit of removing duplication.",1243059119

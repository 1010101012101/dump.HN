And then they can claim they have CP because everything goes through the leader, and the leader was elected by a CP component.

The school suspended him for months in middle school, and I think it has impaired his ability to function as a student. When we tried getting him into the German school system again, he failed his reentry exam out of anxiety (he most likely knew the answers, he just filled in nothing), and another year of schooling at a lower tiered school because he couldn&#x27;t bring himself to fill in exams for the first half of the school year.<p>So I certainly would not discount the impact an expulsion can have on a student, and I think that school administrators should not use it lightly.

PRs are nothing but a `git merge` wrapped in a web ui that shows you a preview of the diff. Since those concepts are equivalent you have to then say &quot;merging is pretty clearly outside the realm of continuous integration&quot;, but I&#x27;d say thats the concept that makes CI possible. By virtue of their equivalence PRs(if you choose to use them) can make CI possible too.<p>I want to be super clear about this using &quot;Forking&quot; and &quot;Pull Requests&quot; have zero limitations when it comes to CI/CD. In fact compared to working out of a shared repo there is only exactly one difference. Since your clone&#x27;s master can diverge from authoritative master you have to periodically synchronize masters(thats that &quot;sync your fork&quot; link I put in the original post) I&#x27;ll admit this is almost a justification for not using forks. Its annoying and tedious to explain to new git users.<p>>It&#x27;s not continuous at all -- it places the onus of &quot;merges&quot; on people looking at stuff instead of trusting the tests<p>This sounds a bit off to me. Continuous integration is about getting good code into the delivery pipeline. Once that code is there you want to get it public as quick as possible. There is a relationship that describes the cost of bugs and bad design decisions as exponential given their proximity to getting into the customers hands. The tests will find regressions but won&#x27;t stop a bad design or a design with a new bug, or a piece code without any tests at all. There are two things to note here catching things early is hugely cost effective and that code reviews are a vehicle for probing a completely different class of problems. The GH workflow is built around code reviews. This is because in the &quot;Social Coding&quot; model you want to make sure whatever rando is delivering code into your repo is respecting your style/development guide. Most organizations want this benefit as well. Do code reviews slow things down? ... yes. But I&#x27;d say thats a feature not a bug :) Are &quot;pull requests&quot; not &quot;continuous&quot;. I don&#x27;t understand exactly what you mean by that or what its value is. But it doesn&#x27;t seem terribly useful by itself.",1441467755

It uses extends for choice/sum/polymorphism.<p>In addition to schema definition, it also has interfaces for RPC definition.<p>The only major limitation I noticed is it lacks recursion (cyclic type references). Important for completeness, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s needed that often in practice - I&#x27;m interested if this is true.<p>One great thing about an IDL approach to schema definition, for RPC, is its similarity to objects/classes - because that is the domain it is used from. It&#x27;s familiar to users, and minimal cognitive burdern to switch between. (Similar argument for JSON - it&#x27;s an &quot;Object Notation&quot;). In contrast, xml schema looks utterly different from objects/classes.<p>I think there&#x27;s even a hypothetical argument for making the IDL look exactly like java - not because it&#x27;s great but because everyone knows it, even the haters (or, maybe borrow Python&#x27;s type hint system - or whatever is familiar to your target users).<p>XML schema has a rich type system, both for structure (eg minOccurs) and primitives. But these aren&#x27;t needed to represent objects, because programming type systems are poorer and lack those features.<p>---<p>I think your main problem is a very old one, of transferring primitive values between different languages (like different languages - even different C implementations - having 16 bit vs 32 bit ints). Text representations like XML and JSON mostly solve this, but of course they can still be too big. You might look at old solutions, like ASN.1, to see the problems that arise, but I think you&#x27;re better off solving much problems when (and if) they occur - because maybe they just won&#x27;t come up in practice today because of conventions unconsciously established, even though theoretically they should come up.  Just make it as easy to use as possible, to get the thing done that the user wants to do, and you&#x27;ll get all the feedback/guidance you need.<p>Maybe you would like to have a type system subset that works for all languages - but this would just hamper those in the one language, or between two languages that are close. OTOH some enterprises like future proof options, in case they need to support other languages.<p>Would love to hear your thoughts and experience on all these issues.",1441467678

The reason for this is that the conditions can be quite complex, and require debug symbol resolution. And this takes up a lot of space.<p>The issue of space is actually a bit subtle. Imagine you have something like (assuming 4 byte fixed width instructions, which is the case on ARM):<p><pre><code>   0000 instruction 1\n   0004 instruction 2\n   0008 instruction 3\n   000c jmp 0004\n</code></pre>\nBreakpoint instructions are generally designed so that they only take up one instruction&#x27;s worth of space. On x86, the opcode is just &quot;0xCC&quot;. Once you start adding in more complex code, you will necessarily use more instructions. Now, suppose your new breakpoint takes up two instructions (bytes 0-8). When the jump at 000c takes place, it will jump into the second of your two instructions, which will probably not do anything good (on x86 this is even worse because you may jump into the middle of an instruction!)<p>There&#x27;s also the practical issue – if you put the conditional test in the patched code, you would need to basically bundle a compiler with gdb so that it could compile the conditional testing code in order to create the patch.",1441467648

In-house tools, mixed with other accounting software, was just sucking time.<p>I know it&#x27;s fun to write tools like this for business tasks, but I think you also have to pick your battles, and when you can pay for an affordable tool that will greatly simplify a business task, I choose this path.<p>EDIT: I recently started using Freshbooks&#x27; API to do little reporting tasks they don&#x27;t provide, and this fills the &quot;make my own tools&quot; void when it comes to accounting.",1441466772

You can do append-only files efficiently on flash (without doing all of the read + write dance). &quot;All&quot; you need to do is take advantage of a bit of scratch space and knowing how flash works. Namely that you don&#x27;t necessarily need to flash a block to write to it, as long as you are only turning zeros to ones (or vice versa, depending on how physical bits are mapped to logical bits. Multilevel flash is a little more complex, but still doable). (For instance, instead of having one filestamp, you have space for 16 filestamps, with two bytes at the beginning, all initially set to all zeros. You check the last bit set and use that filestamp. Congratulations, you now can update the file 16 times before needing to reflash the block. If that&#x27;s not enough, you can extend it arbitrarily (note that you can do this dynamically for files only when they are updated enough to warrant it!) And metadata/etc can be done in the same way. For something like a log file, you have, say, 16 slots for how much of the block is occupied, and a pointer to the next block (or null). You append the content of the new log line to the file and add the new content. One write, no blocks being flashed. (Two writes if/when you run out of space in the block.)<p>See, for instance, <a href=""https://github.com/bnahill/FLogFS/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bnahill/FLogFS/</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2FS/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2FS/</a>",1441466699

10174981,comment,10174270,10174891,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"The idea is that major type features should be exposed via common metadata and represented in the IL. This allows other languages to unambiguously use such types. Non-nullable references are definitely a big enough feature. Conceptually, it&#x27;s bigger than Nullable<T> which is just a wrapper you can toss around any struct and could be done purely as a library (though I understand there&#x27;s some delicacy as far as unboxing null and converting that to a Nullable<T>).<p>I&#x27;m not sure which interpreter you&#x27;re referring to, but languages don&#x27;t need to emit similar IL for executable code (why would it matter?). What counts is that the type defs end up exported in the same manner. If making a class in VB emitted substantially different IL than C#, that&#x27;d be an issue.",1441465653

Some drunk people, when you try to help them out, get aggressive. Even if they don&#x27;t get outright violent, that they threaten is just not pleasant.<p>So I would tend to be reluctant to help people that were above a certain size or physicality. Smaller people were much less of a threat, and I was exposing myself to less danger by helping them. Women, with their tendency on average to be both shorter, lighter and having a smaller proportion of muscle, happened to be below this &quot;physical threat&quot; threshold far more often than men.<p>Some regulars I&#x27;d see intoxicated enough to know that they weren&#x27;t the violent drunk type and they&#x27;d often get a helping hand, even if they were twice my size.

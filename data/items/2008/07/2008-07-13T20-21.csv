245324,comment,245291,245291,0,0,Anon84,,,"I'm not sure I would consider RMS a ""marketing team""... he would be an evangelist at best. And as far as a mission statement he's probably thinking of something people can understand and relate to. Say something like ""a PC in every desk"" and not a spiel about how you should prefer inferior software just because it gives you the option of looking at/modifying the code... when 90% of the users would never do that.<p>An analogy I've heard used several times. Proprietary software is like a tea set. There are differences in quality and features and it's limited in its use (you probably don't want to use your tea set to cook rice). FLOSS is like a piece of clay... sure, you can use it to build a better tea set, and it can even come already shaped like one that you just have to cook, but most of the times you're buying a tea set because you just want to drink tea.<p>heh... just $.02 on it.",1215982390

All you have to do is look at the numbers from DOE themselves, and make up your own mind.<p>Personally I believe we are nowhere near peak oil, due to Bakken, the unexplored resources off USA coastal shorelines, ANWR drilling that should be undertaken, etc.<p>Plus for natural gas we have the undersea hydrates that we haven't quite figured out how to mine cheaply (yet).",1215981252

Once you graduate, and you both start having more normal lives, it gets much easier. Here in NYC, I've not had any trouble finding geek-compatible girls, and have been in several overall very pleasant relationships over the past couple of years.

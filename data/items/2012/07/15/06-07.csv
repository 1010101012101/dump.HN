In this system, you wouldn't have to examine code to answer your question, but you would have to be able to understand some perhaps complex computer-understandable description. That, of course, might be about as fun as reading an XML Schema. Also, since the real Demeter system never caught on, these days we have to do the computer's job manually, which is surely a chore.<p>Regarding many functions that all have the same name obfuscating things, there's nothing in the Law that requires that, of course, though I can see how it might sometimes happen in reality.",1342335401

If you want to trade money between any two individuals on the planet paypal is by far the most likely solution to the problem aside from air mailing gold coins.

The internet and technology are changing at extremely fast speeds. One year you're safe, the next year a competitor has taken your market share. It all happens so fast now.

4246341,comment,4245737,4246046,1,0,nessus42,,,"As to coming up with the ""simplest"" representation, that's almost certainly excellent advice whether doing OO or FP. It should be noted that Hickey has a rather specific notion of ""simple"" that may be rather different from more typical intuitions. This is why Hickey had to differentiate between ""simple"" and ""easy"", where ""simple"" means not intertwined with other things, <i>NOT</i> what seems like the least amount of work. The least amount of work is what is ""easy"", not what is ""simple"".<p>If one is encapsulating the representation behind an API, this simplicity principle is much less important for the representation than it would otherwise be, however, as any complexity of the representation is fire-walled at the API. And the Law of Demeter is a good principle for helping to keep an API ""simple"", as functions of the API that follow The Law of Demeter should return only data and not objects.<p>I'm still not sure how this API business meshes with Hickey's advice, however. He seems to be rather adamant that hiding data behind an API is the wrong thing 90% of the time.

My best guess is that the author has an unstable computer, and they believe that occasional crashes while running parts of this JS mean that their exploit is working. Another possibility is that they tried to reimplement a C exploit in Javascript without understanding the difference between the languages. Either way, it doesn't work.<p>There's all kinds of bizarre silliness in the ""exploit"". They're passing URL-encoded x86 assembly to unescape() in a void context, as if that'll somehow execute the code in the result. (This technique is sometimes useful in heap sprays, but they aren't using it in a way that would work for that -- in particular, they aren't creating NOP slides or saving the result anywhere, so the resulting code would be almost impossible to hit.) They're claiming to have a ""microcode VM"" with a ""scrambler + dynamic encoder + multi-pass obfuscator"", but no such thing is in evidence. There's sillier things still, but I'll leave it for now.<p>I've run the PoC code, because I don't see anything to fear, and, as expected, it does nothing.

And, while the founders being non-business type people may excuse them from some of the blame here, their CFO really doesn't have a similar excuse and probably didn't do them any favors.<p>Where was Seagate at in all of this?

Sure the bankers probably should have warned them about (e.g.) taking the all-stock deal over the half-cash/half-stock deal, but I find it odd that they would make this agreement without consulting the bankers.

Imitating is the very basis of most design anyway - we take ideas from places and things we've seen and build upon them. If you acknowledge that designs don't occur in a vacuum, that they don't spring purely from the mind of the designer without outside influence, then maybe it's not morally wrong to take design elements from anything else, even a competing product. (The question of degree, however, is another matter.)<p>Product differentiation is heavily emphasised in marketing courses because it offers a competitive advantage over similarity. But that doesn't imply products need be differentiated in the first place.<p>Basically, IMO, companies can rail all they want about their designs being imitated, but the law shouldn't stop the appropriation of design elements -- except when it crosses the line into fake products, i.e. when there is intent to trick consumers into thinking a fake is the real thing. Taking the (perceived) pleasing aspects of a design should not be illegal.<p>I don't know, if it were a big company imitating the design of a small but up-and-coming rival, I would be more sympathetic to the small company, and maybe my stance would be different. But 'copying' design is not something that seems intrinsically wrong to me. I take design elements from other websites when I work on my project, and I wouldn't be able to blame another website if it took elements from me. If it imitated my design wholesale, I'd feel bemused and flattered, maybe angry if they were beating me at my own game, but I'd accept it as part of the game.<p>In this case, the Samsung phones I've had experience with have not looked like my iPhone 3GS, so I cannot agree that they slavishly imitate Apple's designs. The Galaxy S you linked does look similar, but the other Samsung phones I've seen do not (unless you consider rectangles with rounded corners to be sufficiently similar).",1342332351

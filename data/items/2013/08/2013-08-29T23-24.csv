6299388,comment,6298485,6299264,6,0,mturmon,,,"I think it&#x27;s an excellent question.<p>The &quot;intelligence community&quot; sponsors a lot of math and fundamental physics work in academia and the national labs.  The grants are laundered through an intermediary, so you don&#x27;t know who and in what agency is interested in the work.  I think of that visible side as one way for them to keep their foot in the door, to check the pace of advances on the unclassified side.<p>But you&#x27;re really asking about the classified &quot;shadow&quot; of that open work, which by definition is hard to measure.  I think one easy yardstick is &quot;how much a mathematician makes&quot; versus the intelligence budget.  This leads me to think that they can hire a lot of mathematicians.<p>And let&#x27;s face it, the subject matter is <i>really cool</i>.  There&#x27;s a reason that mathematicians throughout history have been interested in coding.  Now imagine someone paying them to do it.<p>A senior academic I knew (in the information theory area) consulted at the NSA for several summers.  His work was done in a Faraday cage, and that&#x27;s all he would say about it.  He was top-notch in his field, and he wouldn&#x27;t waste his summers with fools.  I think that there are lots of similar stories.<p>My working belief is that, in certain areas, they are way, way ahead of the open state of the art.  Like with Keyhole, or tapping fiber optic cables, etc.  Not everywhere, but they don&#x27;t have to be ahead everywhere, just in a few places.",1377820715

This is why MLK gets a national holiday and Carmichael is a footnote.<p>BPP and MLK are fundamentally about the advancement of black people from being considered 2nd class and subhuman. Of this cause you say BPP do not help their cause because of use of violence, this is a way of saying that the actions of BPP and the behavior of its members, who are predominantly black, are responsible for keeping their status in society from not improving. The realty is racism in the US has a long and violent history, that racism is what keeps black people and communities from improving their lives and status. Resistance to that violence is NOT responsible.<p>> And, yes, nonviolent protesters can and do face a very large amount of violence. But being violent back tends to solve nothing and MLK knew that. He also knew that with enough favorable support he could affect change.<p>That is true, but MLK was also keenly aware of the need for self defense and that not all forms of violence are unjustified[1][2][3]. Obviously this is a big split of ideology between MLK and BPP, but both MLK and BPP affected some kinds of change.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/the_social_organization_of_nonviolence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documen...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/09/the-secret-history-of-guns/308608/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/09/the-secr...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/CLT/DP02.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/CLT/DP02.htm</a>",1377820434

I would not suggest that.<p>That said, a big move is in order.  Not a product, not a new CEO, but a new mindset being delivered to the public.<p>Open sourcing a core product is a solid post-Ballmer, industry-mind-blowing sort of move that they totally need to rekindle the developer base for the mobile/cloud/wearable/etsy/kickstarter era.  Acknowledge and embrace commoditization -- it is a modern &quot;aikido&quot; style strategy move. Use momentum to gain momentum and throw the opponent.<p>Fighting the inevitable is just ugly and once you lose face (confidence of developers aka R.I.M.) the downhill slide is just that much uglier. Keep in mind they have made some grievous PR moves by missing Tablets and mobile phone market (so far!) For example, Ballmer said iPhone was not going to gain marketshare: \n<a href=""http://allthingsd.com/20130824/beyond-monkey-boy-its-a-steve-ballmer-quote-tacular/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://allthingsd.com/20130824/beyond-monkey-boy-its-a-steve...</a><p>So it&#x27;s maybe(?) time for some humility and &quot;going back to the base&quot; which in Microsoft&#x27;s case probably means their developers.<p>Think about it... Microsoft spent unbelievable sums developing their army of Microsoft developers -- VARs, consultants, and IT developers who were all sold on the Microsoft stack because all of these software products are marketed and sold to be used as a developer platform and as a gateway to riches selling 3rd party apps to Windows users.<p>I think we all know where this story is heading. Many dedicated Windows devs are now eyeing Apple&#x27;s appstore with envy or retooling their skills to use Google AppEngine or Linux on AWS or whatnot -- just because that is where the money is and it seems as if mobile is the end-user platform of the near future, and MSFT is not getting there with Mobile Windows yet.<p>They&#x27;re not even exciting us by putting out a WinWatch or a WinGoggles to walk around with in some future utopian vision. Only now 5 years after iPhone do we see a great tablet and phone operating system from them.<p>So they don&#x27;t own the high ground with developers they once held as the &quot;one and only platform king&quot; and they don&#x27;t own our vision of the future as well.<p>In this way, specifically, I think this is how Windows is <i>different</i> -- if it went FOSS, this army of developers would instantly become twice as empowered.  It&#x27;s a real once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take control of a situation that is heading somewhat downhill, before it becomes a desperation move, thus actually attracting said intelligent, self-interested open source developers.<p>Platforms <i>do</i> benefit from Market Share growth due to the network effect, and vendor lockin of building apps on a platform (cost of switching is really high...) and the fact is that once market share is achieved that MSFT and the 3rd party devs (see above) can sell even <i>more</i> of the proprietary stuff that only runs on Windows (a shrinking number at this point...)<p>When it matters, to replace Windows license revenue, simply &quot;give away razors, sell blades&quot; by replacing Windows license (contract) revenue with support (contract) revenue.<p>The support is provided anyway, of course you don&#x27;t tell Fortune 500 CTO to pound sand if there&#x27;s a bug.<p>So just change the game a bit. Make the same (or more) money. Go from being hated (UGH another windows upgrade) to loved (WHOO MSFT Open Sourced Windows! frees up budget for new Windows application development let&#x27;s buy some SQL Server!)<p>And in practical terms, here&#x27;s what the invoice lineitem looks like:<p>SKU-100 | $99/year | Enterprise-wide Guaranteed Bug Response 1 hour Turnaround / per user / annual subscription - Open Windows 2015<p>The open sourcing process will be somewhat expensive but can be done in tandem with Windows 9 release and really stir up some action on the Operating System front.<p>They cannot rest on laurels, Google will sooner or later get that magic Chrome OS up to snuff and it&#x27;s open source people and if it gets market share they will clean up on services.<p>Google: Giving away (ChromeOS) selling (Google Online Services). It&#x27;s not that revolutionary of an idea.<p>In the end, revenue and profits of Windows is maintained through support subscription and Enterprise add-ons.<p>There could be a lot of new revenue models that seriously benefit from a FOSS Windows like developer training fees and AppStore royalties, but the entire Windows developer world including Mobile becomes open and fresh, new and promising, and with less risk, more security, and a brighter mobile future.<p>It&#x27;s just an idea... worth considering.",1377819219

In fact, Indians were as brutal to the colonists as colonists were to Indians. The first colonists themselves died in large numbers, mostly due to hunger and malaria. Also, Indians were technologically behind Europeans. Modern western countries, to which immigration is desirable, are more technologically advanced and we certainly don&#x27;t have a problem with immunity to diseases - at least you can&#x27;t call it an equally serious problem.<p>So, comparing colonists and indians to the current immigration problems is simply unfounded.",1377817409

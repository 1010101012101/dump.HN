9003504,comment,8997353,9002949,0,0,antoaravinth,,,"Thanks for the explanation. Looks like Java has more memory problems:<p>1. If OOP pointer is going to eat up our memory, there we loose / waste some bits of memory. 
2. And as you have said even using bool type, is going to say waste by 7 bits!<p>Since we are dealing more with objects in java world, then I guess, 32 bit VMs will be much faster than 64 bit VMs. Or even 16bit will be more faster, from my understanding.<p>Still I have a final question over here, all the OOP pointers does goes the CPU caches and registers?",1423148385
9003503,comment,9002151,9003177,0,0,warbiscuit,,,"It&#x27;s not necessarily &quot;slow is best&quot;, but rather minimizing the ratio between how fast your production server can calculate them multiple hashes while under load, vs how fast your attacker can crack them on dedicated hardware.<p>Which, for example, is why something based on SHA3 is bad, because your typical server is just going to be doing SHA3 hashes via CPU.  Except SHA3 was chosen to be ASIC-friendly, so your attacker will be able to calculate SHA3 faster than you.  As long as the attacker has no faster calculation method than the one you&#x27;re using, the absolute speed doesn&#x27;t matter.  This is why scrypt, bcrypt (and to a lesser extent pbkdf2-hmac-sha256) are doing well, because running them on GPU or ASIC isn&#x27;t meaningfully faster than the CPU implementation the defender is using.<p>All that&#x27;s left at that point is making it as expensive as possible for them to parallelize their attack.  Which is what scrypt and other things attempt to do -- require as many non-CPU resources (memory, hd space, etc) so that the attacker&#x27;s parallelization cost is also maximized.<p>(Personally, I&#x27;ve been playing around with the idea of incorporating random accesses to a 2-tb file of random data, so that the attacker would have a HUGE amount of data to steal before my hashes would work. And they&#x27;d have to establish shared access to all the CPUs/etc they&#x27;re attacking with)",1423148354
9003502,comment,9001704,9001704,0,0,phkahler,,,"So the steel companies are finally getting scared enough to innovate. There are people trying to dramatically reduce the cost of titanium, Ford is dumping steel for aluminum, composites are even replacing aluminum in aircraft. Steel is starting to look like a relic of the 1700&#x27;s rather than the great material it has been for so long.<p>When I worked in EVs, one of the old timers (a guy almost 80 years old) told me the best steel for the motors should have some Boron in it. Some particular alloy that would have lower core loss at higher frequencies. But none of the big steel companies were interested in making it for us. They just wanted to make what they make.<p>So even if it&#x27;s not as great as it sounds, I&#x27;m glad somebody is doing something with steel.",1423148342

When I graduated high school (about 15 years ago) the amount spent per student was around $5k a year. The high school was in the top 1-2% of public schools nationwide. The school now spends around $14k per student and is in the top 15-20%. What changed? The perception of the school. The parents whose children would pull that number up have chosen neighboring school districts (myself included).<p>The urban schools actually get the most per student in the state. $14k-$15k from the district alone, with additional state funding pushing that number north of $20k (some schools reaching $25k). There is not a funding issue at all. They have the lowest student to teacher ratios in the state, along with the most teacher aides and social workers.<p>And this isn&#x27;t on the coasts, this is in the upper midwest, so the cost of living is not high.",1423148222

Now imagine 320+ million people all living in different semi-autonomous states all with their own bureaucracies and hundreds of taxing authorities.  Now imagine proposing a national ID card to these people. Yeah, its not that easy.  The US isn&#x27;t centralized like a lot of European nations. Governance of very critical things are done on the state level and that isn&#x27;t going to change anytime soon.<p>>I&#x27;m guessing its some kind of privacy issue behind there not being a similar system in US?<p>The social security system, which is a federal program, produced a unique number for all citizens. The states quickly started using this number in their own bureaucracy and everyone else followed (banks, etc).  Now its a defacto numeric identifier.<p>The big problem here is how easy it is to get credit in my name if you have my SSN, like its the root password to my finances.  Credit is far too easy to get in the states from a paperwork perspective. I should not fear other people getting my SSN. Banks and other organizations need to realize that if someone presents my SSN, that doesn&#x27;t mean its me. More numbers or psuedo-SSN&#x27;s aren&#x27;t the fix here. The fix is due diligence and better fraud protections.<p>Not to mention everyone already carries a unique identifier thats easy to verify - your fingerprint.  I think SSN + fingerprint plus a letter sent to my home that needs to be signed should be the minimum to open any line of credit. SSN alone should be worthless.<p>Its also bothersome that PCI-DSS and other regulations treat credit cards like NSA secrets, which is fine as they should be encrypted, but there&#x27;s no legislation or guidelines to make SSN&#x27;s encrypted. SSN&#x27;s sit as plain-text in every database in the US. That&#x27;s kind of scary and probably invites hacks.",1423148149

In this study, potential nucleation sites for B2 during annealing of wrought sheet steel include (1) grain boundaries or edges of recrystallized austenite crystals and (2) deformation shear bands, which are common in hot- or cold-worked low-density steel. To expand the stability domain of B2 above the recrystallization temperature (normally, 800–900 °C) of deformed austenite, the alloying recipe of an austenitic low-density steel was modified by adding 5 weight per cent nickel (Ni), which is one of the most effective elements for forming B2 with aluminium. The addition of Ni to low-density steel may appear to conflict with the collective wisdom of ferrous alloy design; Ni has been regarded merely as a well-known austenite stabilizer like Mn and C; and Ni has been little noticed in low-density steel design, mainly because it is not a critical determinant of the density in ferrous alloys.» (citations omitted)",1423146645

His thesis is that we now have something better to train the mind than the old classics of Latin and Greek and what was written in them.  Math and science, but real science.<p>So the curriculum has an initial singular focus on reading, &#x27;riting, and &#x27;rithmatic, with the reading selections bringing in the other stuff needed like history.  The math focus is to get you through single variable calculus as fast as possible, and only then do you study calculus based physics and otherwise pick up additional math as you need it.  If there&#x27;s time before college, then chemistry.  If there&#x27;s even more time, statistical mechanics and/or &quot;Call the CalTech bookstore and ask them what&#x27;s the current textbook for the general biology class&quot; (he&#x27;s an alumn).<p>If the child gets interested in a particular science topic, say ants, treat it as a subject outside of the formal learning.

I am looking at features like IntelliSense, marking wrong code, marking typos, marking unused code, telling me about unhandled Exceptions etc.<p>- Is there any difference, on the IDE side, between Scala support and Scala.JS support?<p>- Is a development cycle possible, where I save and I can instantly reload the page in my browser to see the differences?<p>- (Bonus Question) How well does it integrate with React. If my memory is not fooling me, Scala supports something like Inline-XML. Can I write React-Code, like I write JSX code with it? Any examples?",1423145226

If all banks are open similar hours, none of them feel the need to impact their costs by opening longer knowing that it will just force their competitors to do the same and level the playing field again, with everyone (banks not customers) losing out.<p>Barbers, all the ones I&#x27;ve known in a few UK cities have always had at least a couple of evenings they would open for, if not all evenings (though I generally go during the day anyway). Presumably because there&#x27;s so many more than there are major banks, and because it&#x27;s a key decision making factor for consumers - people are more likely to think &quot;I&#x27;ll get my hair cut at X instead of Z because it&#x27;s open when I want a haircut&quot; than &quot;I&#x27;ll bank with X instead of Z because some day I may prefer the opening hours&quot;.

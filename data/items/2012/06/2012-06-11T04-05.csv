In this case essentially the patent is protecting the first person to come up with an idea (and claim it) that may turn out to be popular/profitable later on. I dont think patents should protect ""whoever called it first"" like calling ""shotgun"" to claim the front passenger seat in a car [possibly a regional thing...] This basically incentivizes looking at current tech, brainstorming ""cool ideas"" and a basic implementation, then patenting them so that in a few years if the idea happens to come into vogue the lawyers can be let loose.<p>The Swype concept is what any mild-mannered engineer would come up with when faced with the problem of ""come up with more efficient ways to input text on a handheld touchscreen device"". Here's an idea: ""Use the QWERTY keyboard except don't lift your finger when typing hurr"". I mean, this obviousness can be tested empirically. Take a group of mild-mannered engineers (ignorant of Swype) and ask them to brainstorm ways of inputing text into a handheld touchscreen. How often is the Swype concept ""discovered""? I would venture every time, but hey hindsight bias and all. Furthermore, there is nothing difficult (in the sense of requiring years of research and investment to solve) or technology-expanding about its implementation in software.<p>I'm not sure if ""requires years of expensive R&D to produce"" should be the only criterion for patentability. But clearly Swype, Amazon's one-click purchase, slide-to-unlock, in-app purchasing, etc. are all poor patents and hurt the advancement of the industry and consumers.",1339390345

That means doing ""Array.new.methods - Object.methods"" is subtracting things that may potentially be methods of an Array instance that should not be subtracted.

The fact that Apple fans couch their reasoning as 'Apple products are just the best' does not indicate that they are the best, it just indicates that said fans are completely convinced.<p>Which is not to say that they are wrong - any more than the guy who smokes Camels instead of Lucky Strikes is wrong. Familiarity contributes a lot to your comfort and efficiency with a tool, and it's important to be happy with what you have.<p>Many of the things you like about Apple products are bound to be true. There's nothing wrong with buying Apple products, they are just fine. But it is just wrong to say that there is something wrong with people who choose the non-Apple alternative (like that they are just cheapskates, or poor, or nerds who don't value their time). These things aren't true.<p>It's just that most brands do not have the same hard core of extremely pushy, inflexible evangelism on display here. I don't question that Apple products are just fine.

They use MessagePack with Python which is faster than one with JavaScript.

Nothing forces taxes to be complicated, its not some sort of inherent property of taxes -- and in fact regardless of where people stand on whether taxes should be higher or lower, I rarely find someone who disagrees that taxes are too <i>complicated</i> in the US. The people who seem happiest with the status quo are precisely the ones whose employment relies on it (no offense).<p>I'm really surprised you'd then compare this situation to choosing between different available techs: it has nothing in common except ""being hard"". This is a legitimate expense from a natural consequence of invention: there are going to be several options with different trade-offs. You act as if Amazon is doing you a disservice by providing you with another option. Unlike the tax world, if there was a way to simplify this choice, everyone in the industry would immediately jump on board. You don't have to take my word for it, its the pattern we've been seeing from the beginning of technology. Making and scaling website today is vastly simpler than 10, 15, and 20 years ago. Can you say the same for taxes? Or have taxes become increasingly <i>harder</i> to deal with as time progresses? Many aspects of running a website that required experts yesterday are completely automated today.<p>In other words, the cost of ""choosing a platform"" is justified because there is no workaround and it is not an artificial position that you have been placed in. On the other hand, you have not proven that there is no alternative to a convoluted tax system that requires tax experts -- and furthermore it is not even clear what the benefits of a convoluted tax system even <i>are</i>. BTW, I am not taking a position on this, I am simply pointing out that that is the correct attack vector: explaining why this system that requires tax experts is necessary vs saying ""Sure it is hard, but many other things are also hard.""<p>EDIT: Added last sentence.",1339387503

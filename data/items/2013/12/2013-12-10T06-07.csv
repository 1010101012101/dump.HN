This was, perhaps , one of the first chances for laymen to jump onto a scientific industry which turned out to be semi-permanent.<p>Since we know that education paved the way for the empowerment of minorities, could it be that the statistics that you&#x27;re referencing are really just moving as a function of women becoming wider dispersed and accepted within all sciences, rather than just the engineering ones?<p>Perhaps the statistical anomaly that you cite is really a glimmer of hope for women. Computer science is not the only field that readily accepts them now-a-days, and perhaps those numbers actually indicate a migration across a wider array of science and engineering fields that were not at one time available for them, rather than a disappearance of women all together in STEM.",1386658630

You begin searching the training data to find optimal model parameters and then verifying performance on the validation set. The number ONE mistake I saw most was that when you get bad results on the CV set, going back to step 1.5 instead of just throwing the whole model out. To take your same core idea, tweak it slightly, add/remove a few parameters and restart the process. Unfortunately doing this enough times and your CV set starts to <i>become</i> the training set. Thus leaving your true validation set the day you turn it on live in production with real money.<p>It&#x27;s never a good feeling to see your positively skewed returns in your training, testing and &quot;CV&quot; set morph into essentially a mean zero random distribution in production. This was quite an important lesson to learn for me.",1386658590

You claim hostility, but it sounds like you might mean underrepresentation?<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s for the same reasons that the NFL and NBA are &#x27;hostile&#x27; to Asians, Indians, and any other underrepresented group: they&#x27;re not.  It&#x27;s just a function of what people are culturally exposed to growing up and what we&#x27;re conditioned to see.<p>It&#x27;s silly to think a community that openly accepts whites, Asians, and Indians is hostile to blacks because we&#x27;re a wee bit darker.  Go to a black neighborhood and ask how many startups failed or people who gave up programming because they felt the community was hostile to them.  It even sounds silly, right?<p>I&#x27;m black and the only reason I&#x27;m involved in the tech community is because my mom started working at AT&T 40+ years ago as a punch card operator and worked her way up.  If she hadn&#x27;t brought her work computer home when I was a kid in the 90&#x27;s I probably wouldn&#x27;t have fallen in love with computers.  She also set aside the money to buy me a computer on a 5-year Sears layaway plan or something crazy like that (BTW who buys a computer at Sears?! This guy).  She could barely afford it, but it was important to her because she knew what it meant.  And she only knew it because she unintentionally ended up in the tech world.<p>Culture, exposure, and financial ability are the primary factors in my experience.<p>Might there be some discrimination?  Sure.  Everybody encounters discrimination at some point, some more than others, but such is life.  What&#x27;s sad is when people expect discrimination so they tend to &#x27;see&#x27; it everywhere.<p>I&#x27;ve actually never heard a woman or another black person complain about discrimination in this community and I&#x27;ve never seen it myself.  I&#x27;ve also never thought about it until now, which is a good sign, but maybe I&#x27;m just lucky.  YMMV.",1386658113
6879360,comment,6866652,6868716,2,0,Cowicide,,,"COBRA is vastly expensive for most Americans and does very little to combat &quot;job lock&quot; and HIPAA doesn&#x27;t help the situation.<p>COBRA:<p>• COBRA is prohibitively expensive for most people who are attempting to transition to another job especially with the risks that are often incurred by switching to another job (see below)<p>• It has a time limit.  If it doesn&#x27;t work out with new jobs, you can find yourself without any health insurance.  For example, if you&#x27;re forced to get a job in the meantime that doesn&#x27;t provide insurance, COBRA won&#x27;t qualify you.  Also, even if the job did have insurance and they lay you off, COBRA is expensive and will drain savings (if one is fortunate enough to have savings in the first place).<p>• If things go wrong after your transition to another job and you&#x27;re expensive COBRA runs out you may get stuck with State-sponsored high risk pools with yet even more high costs, waiting lists, poor benefits.  Of course, that is IF you&#x27;re &quot;luckily&quot; enough to live in a state that has such a things.<p>• If you dare apply for another job and your current employer finds out you&#x27;re looking for another job and find an excuse to fire you, you can&#x27;t qualify for COBRA.  You&#x27;re SCREWED.<p>• Not all states are consistent in applying COBRA.  Depending on which state you&#x27;re in, if you&#x27;re denied COBRA, you may be stuck.<p>• If you want to leave a job to start your own business, you may not quality for COBRA and/or afford it in the first place.<p>HIPAA does not ensure that a worker who changes jobs will have access to health insurance coverage on the new job or that the coverage offered will be affordable. Thus, neither COBRA nor HIPAA ensures affordability of health insurance -- the main cause of job lock.",1386658067

Scientific articles are evidence, not truth, and people (and systems) make mistakes.  The hallmark of a robust system is not the absence of error, for it is arrogance to believe you&#x27;ve ever achieved it and foolish to have it as your absolute goal. What is important is setting a reasonable expectation of accuracy, the types of errors committed, the root causes of those errors, and responsible, transparent reactions when errors are made.<p>A system is much more trustworthy when it has a solid history of errors with reasonable responses than a system which claims or appears to suffer from no error at all.",1386657661

If funding were prevalent and actually scaled with the size of academia then people wouldn&#x27;t be so desperate to make a show of their research. It is common practice to claim your research will result in magical leaps in technology, such as curing cancer while making cars more fuel efficient, essentially lying to get funding. On a side note, this is one of the reasons why science news articles are often so far fetched and inaccurate.<p>Certainly making journals free and open is a step in the right direction, it reduces the financial strain on Universities and researchers.  It also the opens the doors for amateur scientists to do solid independent (predominately theoretical) work.<p>I should be clear though, we already have a kind of crowd sourcing system in place: taxes and government funding agencies.  The solution isn&#x27;t to implement crowd sourcing, that would be like putting a band-aid on a leaky submarine.  The solution is to correct the system we already have in place.<p>A central problem with crowd sourcing directly to the public is that the public _cannot_ be swayed to fund science that isn&#x27;t sexy.

Its a strictly speaking one of sociology. The things ostensibly being bought, sold and traded are not the tru determinants of value. The value of Science to an investor is a function of its monopoly position in the distribution of its content; and on its dervivative value as a &quot;citation&quot; flag to grant-writers and tenure comittees. The demand to &quot;feed&quot; this system is really driven on the supply side. The monopoly side on the backend is just an artificial scarcity model and barrier to entry, that indirectly feeds back into the supply function. That is to say, the &quot;citation&quot; credential needs artificial scarcity to function in its role of extracting derivative rents. It is the grant writers and the tenure comittees that ensure they have this subsidy, as a negative cost (free labour) of production. While none of this is new to anyone reading here, the mechanics are worth thinking through. Because the system is sponsored by public money (on the grants and indirectly, the academics) on the one hand, and on the other through public policy (monopoly rights to the iP that comes out of publicly funded research is <given for free> to monopolist publishers). The sociology of all of this is to avoid &quot;mistakes&quot; in the allocation of funds and tenure. That is to say, the adbication of the experts...to other &quot;experts&quot;. But as the article points out...the grant writers and the tenure comittees are abdicating responsibility to....<i>journalists</i>...not scientists or actual experts, per-se in their fields.

And that they can use other, economically efficient, pre-made options for the other stuff. like a electronics hobbyist might enjoy the LED part, where as a crafter would probably enjoy the woodwork and just use a screen to play pre-made games instead.<p>And I agree with you on the screen idea, why dont we see more of that? Though i do kinda feel that we missed that window, now that we have tablets... isn&#x27;t that the same thing? but with screens i suppose you get the size factor. I would love to look into this idea of a custom gaming table... imagine bomberman on a table!! That  would be so cool!",1386655641

It&#x27;s hostility in virtue of the climb of a ficticious hierarchy, albeit a pragmatic-utilitarian one, which fails to acknowledge the socio-political and historical context in which it emerged, not to mention the outmoded economic, peculiar institution that made it possible.<p>To be clear? Slavery made most of America&#x27;s economic infrastructure possible. The subjugation of women made America&#x27;s economic infrastructure possible. The Internet was born out of those economic foundations. There is no meritocracy in a vacuum.<p>Not to be too reductionist, but I believe a big narrative may help here: It&#x27;s like when some bully barges in on a group of kids playing a new game unknown to the bully. The bully calls its friends over, and they all demand that scores be kept and aggression be matched.

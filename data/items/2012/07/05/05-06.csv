At least up until now, they would not respond to administrative commands from the outside. Now they clearly have to. Even if they got security significantly better than they did up to now, this is such a bad idea.<p>Oh, and I believe it's absolutely crazy to push an update like this as part of an automatically installed firmware update: when you alter functionality in such a broad way, the only thing you achieve is that people begin distrusting silent updates.<p>After years in which Chrome and Firefox finally managed to convince the public that silent updates might be a good thing (they certainly are for security - and web developers, I guess), stuff like this goes great lengths in destroying that trust again.",1341467978

I think this article is trying to get away from basic straightforward compliments with something more crafted, but it seems like the (rushed) conclusion was that something genuine that feels like it just had to be said is the best compliment.<p>Then the other day my husband and I went to the bagel place down the street and he randomly told a guy in a Pink Floyd t-shirt ""great shirt"" with a genuine smile to which the guy responded ""thanks, I like it too"".  This really surprised me because my husband isn't extroverted at all and especially not before a cup of coffee.  In fact, I don't think I'd ever seen him randomly strike up a conversation with a stranger.  Its something I'm more likely to do.  And then 10 minutes later as we sat outside this strange came out carrying our order and said with a jolly laugh, ""where's my tip?"" before heading to his car.<p>Something happened there, they connected and it felt nice.  And I was just the observer.<p>We sat and talked about the interaction a bit, because we are in the suburbs before and pondering whether it was due to the fact that people in the city half expect you to be crazy but maybe our new town was different.  If feel like I am still detoxing from living in SOMA for 2 years, but it reminded me just to be more friendly and open to people.<p>So maybe the best compliment is just one that is simple, well meant, and not overly personal or threatening.  It sure felt good in that interaction, not at all like the shallow ""nice shirt"" exchanges amount women in Barneys or the creepy ""nice shirt"" exchanges with men walking by me on my way home from work.",1341466294
4201852,comment,4199808,4201706,0,0,rogerbinns,,,"> On the personalization point, no you don't have to. Honestly, I find that all changes done to Android by manufacturers tend to make it worse and not better.<p>We never talked about whether the others were any good at software either.  The reality is that the iPhone was a transformation from a hardware centric device to a software centric one.  And most manufacturers are terrible at software.  Have you ever heard anyone praising the quality and usability of software from Samsung, LG or HTC?<p>Android let them avoid doing software, but for commercial reasons you still want to do something.  If you have exactly the same software on two devices then the user will use price as the differentiator.  Software is an easy way to make them look different, and to give people a reason to pay more you need to have something unique.  As a Motorola person explained there is no way Verizon is going to stock a bunch of different phones where the only difference is a little Samsung/Motorola/LG logo.<p>Nokia's plans were all over the place.  They were developing multiple different platforms concurrently, but weren't getting traction on the new ones.  They had no idea there was a problem, hence no inkling of an Android solution.<p>If they went Android they too would have customized it to give people a reason to buy their devices over the competition.  (The million people a day activating devices are not you or me.)<p>You can of course prove every manufacturer wrong by starting your own company that does stock only, and make reasonable profits.

She was willing to participate (and was interested) in typing characters on the screen and having something happen, but I just didn't have enough at an appropriate level to maintain her interest. I had hoped to work up to the gui and tuxpaint, but we didn't get that far before she completely gave up. I think there would've been (general) merit in this approach, but there's just not enough command line apps that are suited to this age group. The 2yo could also make the train go, but he didn't recognize it as a train. It was probably too fast to decipher the ascii art.<p>Somewhat strangely, starting the following day, the 4yo started calling her fake baby cell phone a 'computer' and is really in to pretending to do things on it. Crazy stuff like  talking about how well she's doing at playing videos games. We don't play any video games in our house. It's as though I unlocked some possibility of having her own computer and her mind is running with it.",1341465829

4201809,comment,4198271,4198937,2,0,ericssmith,,,"Surprisingly, out of all the comments, this one caught my eye. I've been hiring programmers since 2005 that have to maintain or extend PHP systems. In 2005, it was difficult to find programmers that knew only PHP (or Perl, which was still used) who had any familiarity with object-oriented programming. Over time, PHP has bolted on features, and at each point, the vast numbers of available PHP programmers are (understandably) not familiar with those features. And obviously the systems that have to be maintained don't have these features. So the armies of PHP programmers are well matched to the old systems. This eliminates a huge risk to the business -- finding relatively inexpensive developers. This is an often cited advantage of PHP. But only the PHP of 2007 (or so) is relevant.<p>The PHP of 2009 might be worthwhile for the creation of business value (and possibly the reduction of maintenance-related risks), but as I said, the easily available programmers have no experience in those features or concepts. The more common scenario is that a particular programmer has experience in some other language that already included those features and doesn't mind working on old PHP systems. Believe me, there are not legions of these people.<p>And regarding the 'PHP of 2012', the major problem isn't the availability of programmers who have experience in the new features (they almost don't exist). It is the availability on distros stable enough to support an SLA or provide a modicum of security assurances. This problem applies to all languages though. I'm just pointing out that the 'PHP of 2012' is not as much of an option as it may appear.",1341464792

Lots of practical tips and stuff people probably haven't read elsewhere, startup-centered, easy-to-read.<p>It sunk quickly with only 3 votes.<p>So perhaps I'm not the best one to judge, eh?

This is cross-platform too!<p>This looks like a serious contender to GitX, which I've been using for a few months. The widgets obviously aren't native (I'm on OS X), but they're certainly passable.

The long-term trajectory of programming tools seem to favour developer ease over raw efficiency, as computers get faster but programmers don't (though possibly this might change as Moore's Law diverts from speed increases to multi-core).<p>Therefore, XML became more popular than ASN.1.  I think the successor to XML (and SOAP etc) will be more human-friendly than XML, rather than more efficient.<p>That's not to say that extremely efficient techniques don't have a place (they do) or they're not cool (they are).",1261011803

Many facilities subsequently closed down for lack of sufficient patients, and in fact California lags in the provision on mental health services today.<p>Then, San Francisco is relatively tolerant of 'weirdos' and always has been...while many other cities, especially to the south, are not and give the homeless a fairly hard time. San Diego, for example, is reputed to keep itself free of homeless people by giving them a bus ticket out of town, and I've heard the same thing about other jurisdictions.

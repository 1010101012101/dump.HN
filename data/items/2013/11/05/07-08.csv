6673812,comment,6673460,6673741,1,0,codeddesign,,,"Of course I am talking about right now.  Why would someone want to sign up for a service that they could &quot;possibly&quot; use several years from now?\nThe wonderful thing about analytics is that it doesn&#x27;t affect the user experience.  If you user knows that a camera is going to be turned on when they visit your website, your user activity is going to drastically drop.\nNot to mention you are relying on the fact that not only will it be adopted by users as &quot;acceptable&quot; but also adopted as a pre-packaged hardware.  Otherwise, you are going to have a difficult time convincing end-users to purchase an eye tracking device that they won&#x27;t personally use.<p>The only way that this would be remotely feasible is if you were able to remotely turn on a user&#x27;s camera - which won&#x27;t happen and wouldn&#x27;t be taken lightly by the end-users.<p>Ofcourse - all of this doesn&#x27;t include the cost of awareness that it would take just to make remote use of eye-tracking.  \nYou say &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of eye trackers are on the market.  With 7billion+ people in the U.S., it&#x27;s highly likely that you wouldn&#x27;t receive one person using an eye tracker in the next 10 years - in which you would need hundreds just to make a reasonable estimate on potential site adjustments.<p>I get what you are trying to do, but the market just isn&#x27;t there.\nA better way would be user predictions - or predicting user actions and engagements.  That technology is around but not heavily used yet in analytics and would be able to make similar predictions.",1383638330

It might apply to some instances, for example india defense budget is about $46 billion, a big portion of it could have been certainly spent to alleviate the living condition of poor Indians in general.

6673788,comment,6672578,6672578,6,0,jermaink,,,"Hello everyone, I just want to shout out to those who cross their fingers in front of the screens, hoping for an invitation or being afraid of a rejection. While I&#x27;m writing this, I have to say that I didn&#x27;t apply (this year), but have been in touch with a few YC teams in the last years.<p>Everyone who goes through the application process knows what time it takes and what it&#x27;s worth. Especially <i>worth</i>, because it enables you to reflect on many points and it forces you to make a point. If you are at an early stage working on your product and still iterate lots of ideas you exactly know how challenging that can be. Even recording a 1-min video can be very challenging, if the founders are not at the same time at the same place or have totally different risk aversions. Just ask yourself how much time you invested into the last point and how that could equal in lines of code for your product.<p>At different points in time, I lived with a few other YC applicant companies under one roof and could pretty well observe how each handled the application process and feedback. The most important take-away was that those teams were invited and accepted, who did not care very much about the outcome, while the others studied HN and the application chronologies like monks the Genesis and Levitikus. One team even developed a pathological detail in collecting recommendations from YC alumni, while other teams could tell you the number and names of teams within the last four badges. Unfortunately, the rather too-well informed teams had in common that they struggled to break down their idea into a single sentence.<p>YC is not about rejection, it&#x27;s rather about selection. There is no inversion of this argument, so don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re not good enough. It&#x27;s rather like the Matrix, selecting their Neo-teams with some mixture of likelihood and gut feeling. Just imagine the amount of applications they receive and the short time that allows them to go through it. There are so many small details and factors that flow into a decision that it would take days to summarize them. If you go only through <i>traction</i> and <i>team</i> behind your product, there might be a good chance to find a weak spot already.<p>Without any doubt, Y Combinator is a great way to start a company. In this regard, the book title &quot;launch pad&quot; might be just right. Its just as great as getting into a top university, because you get social proof and a valuable network in many ways (especially the internal startup economy and experience exchange has its benefits). 3, 2, 1  lift off. But at the same point, being at YC might be no self-fulfilling prophecy, even if someone could easily calculate the valuation effects (on paper). Also, getting into YC should not be for the sake of getting into YC. If you really believe into yourself and your idea, you <i>have</i> to make it without a program like this - like all the successful entrepreneurs did before accelerators even existed. Even if there was a launch pad, they still needed to work on their rocket too. Today, you even have a big advantage: YC and its alumni offer so much for free. Not only HN but all the input on the website, blogs, alumni advice, startup school etc. From my experience, the network is not a closed fortress but a very open community with people that care much more about your own ideas than your credentials and affiliations. It&#x27;s an open university where you can access many resources that might be helpful as long as you dont read them like the truth and the only truth. Now I don&#x27;t want to put my head above the parapet and speculate too much, but at the core of YC might be a <i>socratic method</i>, which is about finding <i>truth</i> within the dialogue. Literally, dialogue means the exchange (<i>dia</i>) of reason (<i>logos</i>), where reason means anything between rational, valid and practical. Partners challenge your ideas and approaches and as a result of dialogue, both of you are likely to find something useful to take-away. The advantage of this is that while your best friends are rather likely to tell you lots of things that sounds good to you but are not necessarily the truth, YC might be brutally honest in sending you reasonable signals.<p>To come to a point: If you don&#x27;t make it into YC, my advice is to take care about four things:<p>1. Find people (friends and customers) who give you honest signals and that let you know when you&#x27;re running into the wrong direction.<p>2. PG essays are like the encyclicals of the YC community and they have great points. But be sure to read <i>between</i> the lines and to find your personal take-away, your <i>reason</i>.<p>3. Do not study how to apply successfully or how to hack the process. This is no GMAT or a gumball machine. Try to find out how YC helped the companies who started here, struggled after demo day or came up with a new idea. Maybe, you can emulate some of these things and benefit from information.<p>4. If you have problems making decisions like continuing on an idea or not as a result of not being accepted - throw a coin into the air and decide for head or tail with each one decision. The outcome that you desire while the coin still twists in the air is what you should do.<p>Surely, these methods don&#x27;t replace an office hour but they at least enable you to improve your experience.<p>Good luck and march on!",1383637971

Since passing out about a year ago because of an infection and not drinking/eating anything that morning i have some serious anxiety issues that affect my life in a bad way.

I went to numerous doctors and cardiologists, nobody could find anything of relevance, no risk factors at all.

If the DB server has decryption permissions, and it is compromised, then there&#x27;s little need in encrypting the passwords anyway as an attacker will simply decrypt them by hand. (They may not get all of them before being detected, but they&#x27;d still get some or most --- and they might look for high-value targets!)<p>Unlike ECB mode, you can&#x27;t just encrypt the same password again and check to see if the ciphertexts are the same --- the IVs will be different (hopefully!). So, can you somehow check two ciphertexts with different IVs to see if they represent the same plaintext? Nope, probably not: if you could, then the scheme would no longer have indistinguishable encryptions under a chosen-plaintext attack [1]. Briefly, this ability to test if two ciphertexts represent the same plaintext would allow the adversary in the IND-CPA game to simply encrypt both of the plaintexts and test them against the challenge ciphertext. (See the [1] reference for more info on this.)<p>In fact, this is exactly the property you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want. You don&#x27;t want to be able to determine if two users have the same password. If the DB server were able to test ciphertext equality, then it could pairwise-test each pair of users (or again only hunt for high-value targets).<p>If you were really adamant on encrypting passwords, I&#x27;d also suggest that we&#x27;d need to pad the password out to the max password length to prevent the revelation of password length. But of course, I <i>very</i> strongly suggest against password encryption. Still: that&#x27;s another thing to consider in this <i>hypothetical</i> scenario.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability</a>",1383636290

This problem is only going to get worse as time goes on and DSPs get more powerful.<p>So, given that stealth is the F-22&#x27;s <i>entire</i> reason for being, I&#x27;d categorically state that canceling the boondoggle was one of the smartest things our government has done in quite a while.",1383636105

It involved a lot of broken code, and a lot of error pop ups. Javascript was, historically, a dumb easy scripting language for simple interactive effects on the web.<p>When we&#x27;re talking about a script that is downloaded from a server, and runs in a browser, that is a much different kind of situation than a programming language usually encounters. It is in the browser maker&#x27;s interest to be liberal about what it accepts. this is the core reason for the success of html, and the failure of xhtml.<p>as much as the makers of javascript would like to remove certain problematic features, they cannot without breaking old existing content.<p>Now if you want a strict language in the browser that disallows that sort of nonsense, it&#x27;s easy. Just run JSLINT on your code before deploying it. JSLint considers as an error, pretty much all of your complaints here. If you don&#x27;t like some aspect of javascript, you can simply not use it. If there&#x27;s something jslint doesn&#x27;t catch, I suppose you could always add stuff to jslint.

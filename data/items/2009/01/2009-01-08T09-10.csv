I've been told that Trotsky once said ""Every revolutionary should study chess.""<p>The best book on chess that Libertarians should read is The Wrecking Crew by Thomas Frank, which left me certain after many years that I was absolutely no Libertarian, and more than that, embarrassed to have ever been one.""</i><p>What a clown. Libertarians are not revolutionary. Second, that book has nothing to do with chess, and Trotsky's quote was literal.<p>This doesn't even warrant a rebuttal, but I'll continue.<p><i>""Republican Presidents and legislators use Libertarian arguments to advance policy decisions which benefit business, then conveniently forget those same arguments when it comes to issues of government debt or unnecessary military spending.""</i><p>Republicans and Libertarians share certain conservative values. For what it's worth, one point of libertarianism is that the government's first job is national defense.<p>Ugh, this stuff is awful.<p><i>""If politics were chess, Libertarians would be trying to win by holding up the pawn, saying ""my pawn has a machine gun!"", and making little pew-pew noises. It just doesn't work that way.""</i><p>Politics is not chess. The writer's introductory quote associates <i>revolution</i> with chess. The writer may want to use an outline next time.<p>Here's a summary: The government uses Libertarian arguments for purported corrupt scheming between itself and big business. Thus, Libertarianism as a political ideology is, according to the writer's ham-handed ""arguments,"" flawed.<p>I want my three minutes back; I could've made toast.",1231408171

I'm not a hacker, more the business person, and when negotiating with hackers I offer a relatively low equity stake, fully expecting to be pushed up - to invert this process like Michael, well, if you get close to an exit, make sure he isn't in charge of negotiations with the buyer.",1231407896
424690,comment,423540,424663,0,0,barrkel,,,"Re maintainability - it is not clearly false. The biggest problem with maintenance is figuring out what the code does in the first place. When you know that the code you're looking at has zero data dependencies other than its arguments, and what's more, cannot possibly introduce other data dependencies through any of its descendants in the call graph, it relieves the burden immensely.<p>Re adding and removing side-effects: I think you're just making this up without much experience. Most programs only need side-effects in certain areas, typically in the outermost loops and top-level functions. For example, a very simple single-threaded stateful web server could be implemented only needing I/O access in its outermost loop, implementing its request -> response function in a pure way, and using tail recursion to maintain state between different iterations of the server loop.<p>Re compilers: unless you've written several compilers, you can't make claims about techniques used in compilers not being highly useful in solving large classes of problems. In many ways, yes, compilers are the ultimate functional programs (output is a pure function of input), but guess what: the flow of a compiler - parsing input, inferring its semantic intent, performing required transformations and generating output based on recursive application of patterns - is exactly the same as the flow of an average web request.",1231407780

Here’s a picture of Barack Obama Sr., with Obama's mother Stanley Ann Dunham.<p>Obama Sr. might have had a tiny bit of ancestry from an Arab slave trader or two to whom his African ancestors sold captured black slaves, but he sure wasn’t 7/8ths Arab. In his memoir, Obama rightly calls his father ""black as pitch"" and refers to his father's tribe as ""as ink-black Luo"".  Here's a picture comparing father and son:</i><p>.<p>That article links to this blogpost:<p><a href=""http://isteve.blogspot.com/2008/06/obama-is-not-716th-arab.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isteve.blogspot.com/2008/06/obama-is-not-716th-arab.h...</a><p><i>Wednesday, June 11, 2008<p>Obama is not 7/16th Arab<p>For awhile, a story has been going around that Sen. Barack Obama Jr. isn't really African-American at all, that he's 7/16th Arab and only 1/16th sub-Saharan African. Well, it's not true. Here's a picture of his parents.<p>It's quite possible that Barack Obama Sr. might have been a little bit Arab, and it's certainly possible that some of Sen. Obama's ancestors sold their fellow black Africans to Arab slavetraders. But this rumor that Barack Obama Sr. was 7/8th Arab is silly.</i><p>.<p>That is the entire blogpost. It simply contains a picture of Barack Obama's parents, as proof-enough that his father was Nilotic rather than Arabic.",1231406762

Proof of more complicated properties should be optional.  Haskell requires you to embed a proof of functional purity into every program you write, and this is just not how programming should work.<p>As to maintainability, this claim is clearly false.  Pure programs become harder to change as they grow, because adding and removing side effects requires drastic restructuring.<p>Of course, most Haskell programs (in my limited observation) seem to deal with problems that are mostly mathematical or computational in nature, like compilers and Sudoku solvers, where these issues don't arise much.  But that's not really an endorsement for something that purports to be useful in the Real World.",1231405536

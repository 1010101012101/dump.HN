Until I added a new flag. (Solution: don&#x27;t set your Makefile variables like that.)<p>When I&#x27;ve nearly done it, it&#x27;s always been on projects that have the fairly standard Debug/Release build config system (via whatever mechanism), and the Release build is the one that gets released. But then you have no config corresponding to Release-<i>and</i>-some-temporary-debug-stuff, which is something you basically always need. But if you manage this by hand, it&#x27;s too easy to slip up and have some debug stuff end up in the final product. (Solution: have an extra build config, Final/Product/etc., that is what you use when preparing the final build. So if you get it wrong and leave your debug stuff in the Release build, the result never gets further than other team members.)",1448449160

At least, it could in theory.<p>That&#x27;s how it works for all countries other than the US.  In the US EMV capable terminals are not common so transactions in the US are typically permitted no matter if magstripe or EMV.  This is why starting with October this year the US are finally making the switch to EMV and once that roll-out is complete, magstripe transactions could (theoretically) be either disabled or severely limited.  For instance you might have to confirm a magstripe transaction with a text message.",1448449084

10626543,comment,10624542,10626019,0,0,bad_user,,,"I think Yahoo has had multiple interesting projects of enormous potential.<p>Yahoo.com, the homepage itself, has been and still is amongst the most trafficked websites on the Internet. Even now it&#x27;s in top 5, coming before Amazon, Wikipedia or Twitter. See: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites</a><p>Yahoo Mail existed before Gmail and I don&#x27;t know what happens in other countries, but in my country Yahoo Mail is still the most popular web mail. But they&#x27;ve been bleeding marketshare, because frankly, Yahoo Mail sucks due to poor UI, poor spam filters and stupid restrictions (like they wouldn&#x27;t allow POP unless you had a paid subscription). Compare with Gmail and the rise of Google Apps. Gmail with btw keeps people locked in Google&#x27;s ecosystem, along with Android, insuring that Google&#x27;s search engine also dominates mobile, because that&#x27;s how complementaries work.<p>Yahoo Messenger was a natural extension of Yahoo Mail. In my country everybody was on Yahoo Messenger. It had enormous potential for building a social network and they even made a half assed attempt. Nowadays that&#x27;s been replaced by Facebook and Skype. Even Hangouts is more popular amongst my acquaintances, because Yahoo Messenger also sucks and it&#x27;s basically dead.<p>Flickr has been and is still is the best service for amateur and even professional photographers to share their stuff. Photo sharing is a really big market. Facebook, Instagram, Google Photos, Imgur, Reddit all of them have a place in photo sharing, plus I feel there&#x27;s still enormous untapped potential in this place. But ALAS they let it stagnate, though I appreciate that in 2015 we finally have mobile apps. But then the Pro subscriptions are now more expensive and make absolutely no sense, as you&#x27;re paying for something you can get with an ad-blocker - a fatal combination IMHO. I was a Pro subscriber in the past, but not anymore.<p>Their Search could still be a credible competitor. They just made a deal with Mozilla for distributing Firefox with Yahoo&#x27;s search by default. But on one hand they ditched their own technology, now relying on Bing for their own results. And also they bring nothing new, while being inferior. They could at least take a stance on privacy, I mean if you can&#x27;t compete by being superior, at least compete by being the ethical choice. But no. And I&#x27;m pretty sure many Firefox users simply switch back to Google, just like myself.<p>Delicious, just like Google Reader, had enormous potential for a specialized social network of things. They couldn&#x27;t see value in it and sold it. Oh well.",1448448746

That is not something trivial, that is a very bad abuse of government power if the person you do this to is not engaging in a crime proportionate to that measure. Note that without government assistance he would not have been able to pull this off.<p>>  Cops in America will shoot a black teenager just for walking down the street (literally).<p>Yes, and it is an <i>extremely bad</i> thing that this should happen. And I think that there is a lot wrong with American society that such excesses are not dealt with swiftly and very forcefully because the general message appears to be that this is ok. See also: driving while black and a whole pile of evidence that seem to indicate that America, while on the outside seen as inclusive and a place where everybody is equal is underneath that veneer a terribly racist society where being born black is equal to a much higher percentage chance of being murdered by the police or jailed for a significant portion of your life. But that is not the subject of this thread.<p>> In fact, police frequently kill innocent people of all races due to misunderstandings or with stray bullets. It is unfortunate, but we all understand that it happens.<p>It is not just &#x27;unfortunate&#x27;, it is an extremely bad thing and the lack of police restraint in the USA is something that has never ceased to amaze me and I&#x27;m really happy I don&#x27;t live there. Police should be respected, not feared and the color of your skin should not be a major factor in whether or not you&#x27;re going to end up with a police bullet in your back (or 16 of them, to refer to one recently in the news case).<p>> It is possible that you would be equally eloquent in your deridement of police procedures if those stories were on the homepage of hackernews.

Special Branch like paid overtime, hence they got someone new to focus on. The hunt campaigners won however and hunting with hounds got banned. Though it must be pointed out that a large number of the public in general favoured the ban by 2004: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_Act_2004#Public_opinion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_Act_2004#Public_opinio...</a><p>Now nearly everyone is working on the Islamic desks.

The Irish responded well to payment in cash and drugs and &quot;look the other way whilst we continue our Mafia-like activities&quot;, since for the most part, they were a well armed and well funded crime syndicate with a religious hard-core. Islamic fundamentalists haven&#x27;t responded so well to offers of cash for information.<p>Also in terms of putting officers inside these groups, the UK has a very small minority of officers that could actually blend in undercover, although the trend is increasing.

If you were called a bad name in school (not systematically mentally beaten down but occasionally called stupid or something), then forgetting is a real option.

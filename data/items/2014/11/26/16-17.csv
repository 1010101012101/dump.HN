8663237,comment,8662747,8662747,0,0,shittyanalogy,,,"I never really understood the value in ticketing cyclists, or jay walkers for that matter in NYC. Very few people are getting hurt, even in the densest metropolitan area in the country so why are we so worried about it? Because cyclists can be annoying sometimes? Also the city speed limit went down to 25 mph. Isn&#x27;t this supposed to take care of many of the collisions? Those of us that are safe cyclists but run red lights are going to be discouraged from riding as it just takes too damn long to cycle around smoggy, loud NYC stopping at every goddamn light. But those of us that are aggressive ass-hole riders are just going to be more likely to unsafely try to evade the police. Which is not hard if you know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>It doesn&#x27;t appear to be about safety, as the statistics clearly indicate that it&#x27;s currently safe. It appears to be about making money and possibly discourage cycling.",1417021196

Ultimately the masses will only take action if food or shelter is at risk.&quot;<p>Democratic Constitutional Republic, not a pure democracy. The entire existence of the American System was against the European oligarchy and for the establishment of American aristocracy (the founding brothers weren&#x27;t saints, they were monied land-owning aristocrats).<p>The real problem is that the oligarchs in the City of London have continually subverted the American System and entangled us abroad (triple entente, anyone?), and have corrupted all our branches of government. The American Constitution, if we actually followed it, provides mechanisms to deal with problems such as this. Namely, the idea of equality under the law. Ah, but the justice system is corrupt to, up to and including SCOTUS.<p>Please stop conflating democracy with our Constitutional Republic, and also stop vilifying a system that is not in it&#x27;s proper state, eg, you essentially imply that democracy is a fad because it&#x27;s been shown to not work, when if fact it has worked in some cases so well that it became a threat to the oligarchs and they actively subverted it.<p>Our problem is the oligarchs, not the system itself.",1417021178

I&#x27;m talking about the abusive frats that (a) cover up disgusting and almost invariably illegal behavior by well-connected, privileged men, (b) disburse connections from the upper class into its next generation, and (c) are heavily responsible for the injection of bro types into the VC-funded founder ranks.<p>There&#x27;s a wide spectrum of &quot;fraternity&quot;. Just look at initiations. There are some where initiation is being driven 5 miles off-campus and having to find your way back, and others where it involves bodily fluids, physical abuse, and dangerous levels of alcohol.<p>When people complain about &quot;frat boys&quot; or &quot;bros&quot; infesting the Valley, we&#x27;re not talking about guys who like to drink occasionally or streaked a football game, because none of that&#x27;s a big deal. No one has a problem with an occasional game of beer pong.

8663195,comment,8662348,8662538,0,0,romaniv,,,"Same here, to a greater extent. Why? At the highest level, because it&#x27;s a language that was chosen based on a whim (not merit) and is now being extensively worked on and showed down everyone&#x27;s throats. I like languages, plural. I like new languages. I like to have a choice. (And no, I cannot &quot;simply chose something else&quot; if I have to work with people who say every other choice is invalid <i>by default</i>. And yes, this is the mentality I commonly see.) In a way, JavaScript is the new Java.<p>The core language (syntax, available directives) hasn&#x27;t changed much since the time everyone deservedly hated it. Its performance was optimized, it got many more libraries and it is still the only language supported by browsers. But the question is, why all of this applies to JavaScript and not Python/Ruby/whatever?<p>A lot of its benefits people claim simply <i>weren&#x27;t around</i> when they chose to stick with it. It&#x27;s like saying you chose IIS over Apache because of features of C# 5.0 and ignoring the fact that you chose IIS in 2004, where C# 5.0 was not around. It&#x27;s a dishonest argument.<p>Speaking of which. How can people claim that JS benefits from the same language running on client and server when 90% of server-side libraries do not work on the client and there are potentially major differences even in core library (e.g. forEach)?<p>Also, a huge part of JS ecosystem are kludges, crutches and workarounds that make the stack way, way more complex that it should be. (E.g. source maps. Imagine someone minifying PHP for faster parsing and then asking everyone to use some source mapping technology for debugging. They would be laughed out of any conference or discussion.) This mentality permeates <i>everything</i>. I mean, seriously, require directives need to be implemented <i>as a library</i>? Namespace isolation is a closure-based hack? Can you imaging stuff like that being tolerate for any other language?",1417020802

Doing this they exert a force on the air around them which in turn will exert a force on the truck containing the air. On average this force will balance the weight of the pigeons.

It&#x27;s an easier language to learn than Javascript since there are fewer &quot;features&quot; one must learn to avoid. It&#x27;s also rather prevalent in the web development space. And the bonus is that if, later on, they want to transition to another area of expertise there are fields such as scientific and cloud computing that use Python rather extensively.<p>If the other friend is fluent in DSP and has some exposure to C I would suggest staying on that tack... take a refresher course in C and possibly pick up a scripting language like Python on the side.

A significant portion of it is likely traded off-exchange so discovery of the true value of the commodity is a huge issue.  It sounds like these four companies see a lot of flow in one form or another and thus have a better idea of what the true market price is.  They also probably have significant counter party exposure to each other through derivative contracts.  Meeting twice daily to compare notes and settle on a price to adjust margin, etc. It doesn&#x27;t sound very nefarious. It just sounds like a bunch of market participants trying to figure out the right price. And of course they use this information to make money for themselves - that&#x27;s how a market making operation works.<p>Now you could make the argument that regulation should push more of this type of trading onto an anonymous Exchange where price discovery is available to everyone and this drives down the information advantage that insiders have.

It turns out the reactor pattern is a good way to build network servers that scale reasonably well with minimal developer effort. In my experience developers tend to avoid writing threaded code in synchronous languages, and threads don&#x27;t show up very often in run-of-the-mill solutions. To be sure, JavaScript&#x27;s lack of threads is a blemish, but oddly it forced the community to focus heavily on distributed architectures, and as a result most of the tooling encourages distributed systems, which is a win for some common use cases.<p>2. Type safety is a hotly debated topic and I don&#x27;t think you can find resolution on this one. For some people, &quot;weakest of weak typing&quot; is a benefit.<p>3. Static vs. dynamic, see #2.<p>4. Do you mean that everything must be enforced by convention instead of static code analysis, compile-time checks and type safety? If so, I think you&#x27;re making the same point three times.<p>Erlang is a beautiful language and may be the most correct in some sense, but doesn&#x27;t look nearly as attractive to the kinds of teams I work on when you start to consider developer availability, library ecosystem, tooling, ISP support, documentation and community.",1417018853

Currently, I work on a consultancy basis, conducting due diligence in a part of the world where such business intelligence investigations are not entirely legal, and transparency is a bit... farcical. My clients are investigative services firms that lack a presence in this country. Most of their clients are financial services firms or investors.<p>I&#x27;m a discreet investigator and my cases have revealed share manipulation on local capital markets, as well as  dishonest business practices, though the standard services I perform involve reputational due diligence and market research. My job exists because I enable international companies and investors to improve their M&A and partnership processes, unearthing information that is often in the public record, but difficult to access, or verifying facts that can only be confirmed in person. I do this in the local language and sometimes manage a team to bolster my results. I&#x27;m good at digging up documentation and comfortable conducting in-person or phone interviews.<p>I wish to return to the US and work in the tech sector, which is both a personal and professional interest, and I believe my skill set can be strongly applied in business intelligence research, or supporting marketing/sales teams.<p>There are lots of jobs like this available at corporate consultancy firms, but I am interested in learning if someone with my skill set can work in the tech/startup world.

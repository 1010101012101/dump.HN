Universities may need to compete explicitly on that advantage, without the pretence of a better education. That world would look very different.

803871,comment,803287,803287,0,0,jerf,,,"A couple days ago there was some complaints that technology hasn't actually changed anyone's lives, and I made the claim that while we may be paused now while we consolidate some things, the changes are coming. Here's one for you now: In twenty years (by the time my son would be graduating), the centuries-old idea of college will probably be gone.<p>I've been thinking about the implications of this article for the past couple of hours (since my previous posts), and I think it could very easily cut far deeper than people realize. Once we have ~$100/month college education, why wouldn't an advanced high schooler opt for that instead of standard high school classes as we see them now? And once the mental block of ""schooling must take place in a school"" is gotten past, what's going to prevent that from going ever-lower in age? Why wouldn't even a middle-schooler prefer to learn math at their own pace instead of locked to all of his or her classmates?<p>And... once ""school"" consists to some significant degree of distance learning, what is the purpose of clocking in at a school building? Now, there are answers to that question (two-working-parent households using it for child care, for instance), but it's going to radically rewrite the school social contract.<p>If this sort of thing even remotely succeeds it'll start rewriting more than just the college social contract, it's going to extend way down.<p>(Of course today it's just introductory courses, but that is very, very correctable over the timespan I'm looking at here. This is a game-changing price point even if they triple it.)",1252021701
803870,comment,803826,803858,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Hardware encoders are not feasible for ordinary consumers at all; if you want an encoder that produces reasonable compression, you have to go up to the $10k-$50k range (and even there, most of the ones on the market are really not very good!).  Low-end hardware encoders are both often slow (usually outperformed by x264 on a cheap quad-core CPU) and extremely bad at compression.<p>Plus, a CPU can be used for things other than encoding video, while a hardware device is of course useless for anything else, so it's easier to justify spending money on a fast CPU than on a task-specific piece of hardware.<p>Also, it isn't really an edge case; it will occur in <i>any</i> application which has a working set that is unavoidably larger than the L1 cache.

803868,comment,803667,803830,0,0,rewind,,,"I want to add an additional comment about the diet for you. The diet is BY FAR the most important part of this. Finding an hour in your day is not that hard. People who say otherwise are full of shit and just making excuses -- I work 60-70 hours a week, easily. If you have small children, that's a different story ;-) I don't, but I can see that their schedules and responsibilities are far more demanding than mine.<p>If your diet is not already clean, and you're not used to eating five or six smaller meals spread out over the day, it will be a lot to get used to. You can easily burn 6-700 calories in a workout. But you'll want to cut your calories and eat very smart and healthy. If you consider that you need to have a calorie deficit of about 3,500 compared to what your body needs in order to lose a pound, you can burn 500 calories and cut 500 calories in a day, and that will give you about a two pound loss for the week, which is a good goal. But you only have to worry about the workout for an hour a day. You have to worry about your diet ALL DAY.<p>The good part, as I mentioned above, is that there is no fad here. You have a tonne of flexibility as far as what you can eat, and as long as you cut out junk like soda, junk snacks, burgers, pizza, etc. you should the pounds drop off very quickly. I didn't even think I had 20 pounds to lose, yet I had lost 20 pounds in 60 days.<p>But the workouts make you want to eat better, the healthy diet makes you want to workout more, and when you start seeing real results (which you will very quickly if you follow the system religiously), that will motivate you even more.<p>Really, I cannot speak highly enough about this program if you're willing to commit to it.",1252021642

There has to be a solution to the ""money flow in > money flow out"" problem. And due to the enormous fixed costs a college campus implies, if demand drops far enough, you may not be able to make the numbers work for much more than the very, very highest demand people. And that says <i>niche market</i>, which is going to be a big transition away from where we are now.<p>There's probably some convenient economic term to describe this.<p>Ultimately, you sort of missed the point of my message, which is that it isn't enough to merely establish that these are good or desirable qualities of a college. You have to establish that there's enough people who think it's the <i>best</i> choice to make it economical. Colleges have to beat every other option from the point of view of enough people that they can turn a profit because colleges are in a free market, and will very soon be facing stiff competition from a new competitor that will undercut their prices by <i>orders of magnitude</i>, while simultaneously providing services that will be in many ways superior, probably superior enough to make up for the ways in which they are inferior.<p>A few art colleges will survive and a few music colleges will survive, and I tend to agree the Ivy league will survive (but they will bleed), but at the end, nobody is going to look around at the landscape and say that ""colleges have survived"". It's going to be a bloodbath.<p>Try to cut out the emotional overtones and just imagine a market where someone comes out with a competitive product that is <i>orders of magnitude</i> cheaper, while being fairly substitutable for the original product. Technically, there are still people who make shoes for horses, and they come out to your house to do it. They aren't gone. But they aren't a significant industrial force, either.

803833,comment,803479,803479,0,0,unalone,,,"A year ago I'd have agreed with you. I just changed colleges and spent a short gig at Princeton, and now I wouldn't doubt that what we think of as colleges today will remain in some shape.<p>The college experience is about independence and about <i>sharing</i> independence. It's not about the classes so much as it's about what comes out of those classes - what thoughts, what productions, etc. I just had my first video production class. I'm certain that the various technical lessons are ones that I could get for cheaper, and the various artistic lessons I'll skim over. What I <i>wouldn't</i> get is the feeling of community and collaboration and togetherness, the almost-fantasy of being alive and alone and at the same time together with everybody else. I'd also probably be hard-pressed to get the high-level gear that I get to use.<p>Granted, I'm in a unique position now because I'm at an art school rather than a generic lib-arts college. My student body is all geared towards certain things more than others. The result is that I'm in a community that feels uniquely welcoming of me, and it's a physical community, meaning that I'm living in the midst of these people, and it's a personal community, meaning I'm making, hopefully, lifetime connections and profoundly changing my life and my worldview. I get to live in the middle of extremely over-the-top people, extremely ambitious people who are ambitious in a way you can't find online. (There are two big tenants of ambition that I identify: One sort you find online right here; the other sort might be impossible to move gracefully online; in any event, it hasn't been done yet.)<p>I'm in the same position learning-wise that I was last year: All my classes feel beneath me, and in the areas of my expertise I'm quite a ways ahead of most of my peers. So last year I was considering dropping out rather than transferring and paying a shitton of cash - If I'm not learning, I reckoned, surely I could survive for a decade on the same amount of money and learn on my own?<p>Yes, <i>but</i> I'd lose a few instantly material things. I'd lose access to the career drive that my university provides: I'm expected to leave here with a portfolio good enough to land me anywhere I want to go, and the university will insist on my making it as good as possible. I'll lose the creme-de-la-creme of the professors here: Right now I get tutelage under Emmy Award-winners and studio executives and all sorts of people whose experience is much more useful to me when delivered in person over hours-long conversations. Finally, I'll lose the access that I have now to thousands of talented beautiful people looking for a way to spend an evening. Two days ago on a lark a kid and I finagled our way into an interview with a bestselling author and a movie star. That's quite an experience, and it's one that wouldn't have happened without the particular synergy of the guy I worked with to get the interview (I wouldn't have had the ambition to secure my way in, he wouldn't have known what-all to ask about). When you're with a unique group, there's a pulse that colleges are specifically designed to attract. Not all of them do this, and I don't know which ones do and which don't (I have my doubt about the Ivies, actually), but the ones that do will find themselves prized as always.<p>Now, what I <i>do</i> think will happen is that live-in colleges will change their path. We're going to see education happen faster and more in-depth at younger and younger ages. I suspect colleges will respond by specializing more and more, which is a <i>good</i> thing - it will create stronger and stronger communities of people. College sizes will shrink, as large schools become more difficult to keep interesting. College may also not be viewed as an essential part of finding employment, which is also good - it will strengthen the value of the experience for the people that choose to go.<p>I don't see why colleges have to beat every other option. That's like the argument that one form of entertainment will rule supreme over others, that books will be killed by plays will be killed my movies will be killed by video games, with all the other little anal arguments in between. For college to survive, all we need are a few dozen thousand people to decide that the fantastic experience of college is worth quite a lot of money, and I suspect it won't be hard to find them. There are enough people who've had real college experiences (now myself included) that the core ideas that made the experience so good will continue for a long time to come.",1252020555

No children, or an over-worked prematurely-balding vicarious living vehicle, will result.  Self-perpetuating cycle.<p>#2 has a weight problem, and will probably sink into a muttering pile of self-loathing in his late 20s, only to rise again as a slightly-douchey fitness freak or a committed family man.  He will marry, be quite happy in mediocrity and become a bearded old programmer.  Lots of kids.  Weirdly, this one is most likely a gun-toting Republican.  Kids will most likely be a bit less incurious, which will make him proud.<p>#3 is cool and I want at least one on my team, but because he's a lone wolf by definition, he gets uncomfortable easily.  He's most likely a man of at least a couple vices.  Has a billion hobbies and a pile of old equipment.  Least likely to be academic, which is at odds with his vast knowledge.  Simultaneously happy with the present, but haunted by a hope for what could possibly be.<p>#4 also looks on Google for answers, cuts corners at every opportunity, is a great engineer because he conserves all possible energy.  Marriage is unlikely, but will probably be an okay father if he manages to stick around for longer than 10 years.  Least likely to manage the money he makes without a stickler for a wife.<p>I'm happy knowing all 4 types.  I'm happy being a 3rd/4th hybrid.

Socratic questioning doesn't exist around 80% of the engineering classes at my school (UIUC), and we're ranked 1-5 in basically every engineering field.  The advanced math here is pretty much the same, although I think our math department is only around average.  The point being, the lack of socratic questioning in the classroom isn't a disqualifier for a beneficial education.  Sometimes just presenting the material and giving someone a problem set is the right thing to do.  The benefits from socratic questioning can be achieved elsewhere.  Hacking on an open source project, posting in online forums, or speaking with professors, for example.<p>All of that being said, I'm not convinced of the benefits of this online system.

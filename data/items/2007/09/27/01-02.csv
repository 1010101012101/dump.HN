We're not ready to present there yet but it was an awesome experience to see everybody present.  It showed us what investors are looking for.  Ie: 20% of the time is spent talking about the idea, 80% of the time is spent talking about the exit and the terms.",1190857449
60113,comment,60076,60076,0,0,revolvingcur,,,"This seems a little misguided.  Firstly, I don't intend to create most of my important documents in a web application for a long time yet (read: 5-8 years at least).  It'll be awhile before there's a high-quality IDE/<i>real</i> Photoshop alternative/video editor/etc. online, and who wants one anyway? The desktop paradigm rules for its speed and better support for multitasking, so much so that I believe it will never really go away.<p>Second, not everything is collaborative or needs to be shareable.<p>Third, you can be optimistic, but there's no denying that at today's transfers rates, getting something into and out of the cloud is an arse of a lot slower than pulling it off a HDD or even a LAN.<p>Everything we've done so far in the realm of online document creation will be as a toy compared to what is to come.  Starry-eyed optimism is great in some settings, but calling for the death of backups is not the right way to build momentum.",1190857208

60110,comment,59596,59658,0,0,nailer,,,"You have a good idea, but I don't think you're good at communicating it. The above is a good example - I don't know anyone that sets out to 'digitize (their) real relationships'. They might do that, but it's that's a means to an end, not the end itself.<p>Users are focused on end goals, not means. The end goal for Facebook is to keep in contact with friends, meet new people, organise events, and show off their photos.<p>Nobody wants to digitize anything. If FB initially told its users they've made a service to digitize their real relationships, they wouldn't be very popular.",1190857076

Think of it this way: that group is now more motivated to get lots of unqualified candidates to apply, rather than find good investments.<p>I know it's tough to get your foot in the door, because you start from knowing no one, and it feels like only friends of friends get funded. It could take you a year to go out and meet investors and start to build your own reputation, so do it before you have a project to pitch. Really.",1190856582
60104,comment,59837,59932,0,0,Darmani,,,"Spelling was phonetic around Shakespeare's time, and, thus, the most common words had many different acceptable spellings.  Nowadays, if you don't conform to dictionary spelling, you'll look like an idiot, and your sentences may require a few extra deciseconds of mental head-scratching to read.<p>As for the rules of proper English, while it is completely arbitrary whether split infinitives are proper English, if you constantly comma-splice, have improper capitalization, or even omit punctuation, then many will have trouble understanding you, and you'll really look like an idiot.<p>The moral of the story is that those who speak ""the English language"" have difficulty understanding those who speak ""teh inglish langwidge.""",1190856532

60101,comment,59990,59990,0,0,robg,,,"As a philosophy major, what initially geeked me about the brain is that we could begin to understand philosophical problems in the material terms from which they arise. My work has shown that the British Empiricists were right, to a certain extent. Other work has shown that different forms of moralizing - utilitarian and the categorical imperative -  use different brain systems. That's the story of philosophy in my eyes - asking questions and postulating answers well before the tools were available to address them. The great fracturing of science into different disciplines reflects how those questions have been addressed as the proper tools have emerged in the history of science.<p>A fun game is thinking about what philosophers would be doing if they had today's shoulders to stand upon. Descartes no doubt would be in robotics. Hume a neuroscientist. Spinoza in computer science. Heidegger wandering the streets. Kant a Republican. Even more fun to think about is whether the structure of their brains led them to their conclusions - less free thought than self-discovery. Sort of like how Picasso is thought to have painted with brain damage.<p>Of course, that historical perspective doesn't address the current state of the field. To me, the modern philosophers are struggling to maintain their ""privileged"" grip on problem spaces. And that's why I do neuroscience!",1190856347

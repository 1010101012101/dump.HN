As I said earlier, the Vaio Z is really a much better machine overall, but has a price to match. The Lenovo X1 is also very good and I think looks better as well.<p>Of course, I'm probably a little biased against Apple--although I seriously considered getting an Air as my new laptop recently--and have found their recent laptop designs a little garish. There is a gigantic, <i>light-up</i> logo in the back! My roommate had a Mac Book Pro last year and it would light up our room if he used it at night. I favor a more minimalistic, muted aesthetic--if I could, I'd get an all matte black laptop with no labels <i>at all</i> (including the keyboard), but I do not think anything like that exists.

Microsoft assured that their platforms were good because they used their own platforms themselves. For eg. all Microsoft windows software would use the same API's that third-party developers would use.<p>You look at Google and for them the platform and developers are secondary. API's are not only an afterthought (such as in Google+) but they are something that other people use, not Google.<p>They kill services and API's because they don't need them and it doesn't effect them - but it does effect the users.

If an employee is behaving badly or underperforming, then you have an excuse to fire them. If you got rid of at-will employment, you can still fire bad employees.

3219551,comment,3219014,3219526,4,0,tikhonj,,,"I don't know about gestures on Linux. I've heard there is a package but never bothered with it. I basically do two things on my computer: I browse the internet and I edit text (programming, writing, homework...). For both of these tasks--and most other things I do less commonly--I can just use the keyboard. All this means that I only use the mouse/trackpad if I really have to--it really slows me down.<p>In my experience, Mac OS is not the most well-designed OS at all. Whenever I have to use it, it manages to annoy me fairly consistently. It isn't bad, of course, but all modern operating systems--especially Linux--have improved drastically in the last several years.<p>CMD vs CTRL is not a function of Mac OS/Windows, it's a function of your keyboard layout and both proprietary solutions get it wrong: CTRL is actually the key labelled Caps Lock. Everything else you've mentioned is also present in Linux, at least with KDE--it's well designed, consistent and even lets you scroll windows off focus (I think the scrolling, as well as other window conventions date back to older Unix window managers that predate both KDE and Mac OS). KDE also lets you have some very useful key combinations. Particularly, I like being able to tile a window left or right with a single keystroke, which is trivial with KWin. That said, I'm going to take this idea to the next level and switch over to XMonad soon, which is a nice upgrade for OS X as well (a couple people I know have used it there successfully).<p>Coincidentally, why would you need to get another notebook for Windows and Linux? As far as I know, you can dual/triple boot with a Mac, or you could just get a virtual machine.<p>Ultimately though, the qualities of Mac OS are rather tangential here (and we're ignoring the philosophy behind it even more)--if you're not willing to use anything else, you're stuck with Apple. If, on the other hand, you're like me and see no reason to use it, the quality of hardware become important and finding the best lightweight notebook pertinent.",1320918363

I got my first Macbook Pro in 2009, liked it, got used to it but somehow wanted to go back to a rigid business laptop where i dont have the fear of scratching it etc. So i sold the MBP and got a Dell Latitude only do realize how much of a difference the trackpad on a MBP makes and how much i got used to its awesomeness.
Today i use a MBP again ;)",1320916479

Kahneman and Tversky tested something else completely. Namely, that people tend to ignore base rates when making probability estimates. From Kahneman's book:<p>""In one experimental condition, subjects were told that the group from which the descriptions had been drawn consisted of 70 engineers and 30 lawyers. In another condition subjects were told that the group consisted of 30 engineers and 70 lawyerss.

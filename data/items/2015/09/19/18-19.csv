10245209,comment,10244771,10245131,0,0,chmullig,,,"In my mind, there&#x27;s two points to Stan. The first is the actual math -- it can fit lots of models, much faster and more flexibly than other alternatives.<p>The second is to go out and meet the practitioners where they are. That means making Stan models look like the equations in your paper. It means connecting to existing research software ecosystems. It means making it easy to adapt. In this case, if you end up tightly coupled to, say, specific R data structure then it becomes much, much harder to make it also work well for Python, and for Stata, etc. Additionally, it means that if I start on a model in Python then I cannot easily switch to using R (or vice-versa).<p>Using a DSL also has the nice property of cleanly separating Stan world vs R world. That makes it easier for users to build an accurate mental model for what happens when/where, which hopefully then leads to better performance.<p>Most importantly though, Stan code is incredibly concise and clear for specifying models.",1442689160

(Disclosure, I&#x27;ve taken 2 classes with Andrew Gelman[1].<p>For those who haven&#x27;t used it, the typical usage is to use Stan in combination with other languages (most commonly R). In the Stan language you define a model, specifying the data you&#x27;ll get, potentially transformations to that data, then a set of parameters you want to fit, then finally a model saying how those parameters interact with each other and the data. You can also define priors for parameters. Then typically you save that model, and using R pass in the variables to a Stan call. The resulting fit object is returned to your original environment automatically.<p>It actually fits the work style reasonably well. All data munging happens as before, but instead of having some complicated model expression in, say, a glm() call, you have it in Stan language.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this, Gelman has two great books.

At first, the industry laughed, and said that Apple would be forced to cave and implement Flash support or lose sales to phones that support Flash.<p>Meanwhile, Apple was trying to sell hardware, and Flash makes hardware suck. It runs hot, it sucks up battery, and consumers blame the hardware, not Flash.<p>Who says, “Flash has terrible battery life?” Nobody. They say, “My iPhone barely lasts an afternoon before I need to charge it again.” Flash freeloads on the hardware, because nobody blames it for their bad mobile experience. In hindsight, it’s obvious why Apple refused to support Flash: It degrades the iPhone experience.<p>So Apple “blocked” Flash, and iPhone grew anyways, and it was Flash that got killed by iPhone, not iPhone killed by Flash.<p>Now Apple is making it easy to kill ads. And it’s for the same reason: iPhone owners would rather read certain web sites on their desktop browsers, because the experience of reading on the iPhone is terrible, thanks to ads. They suck up battery and hog the limited viewport.<p>If this had happened five years ago, people would laugh and say Apple was shooting itself in the foot, and that web sites would simply block Apple users that use ad blockers. But having seen what happened to Flash, they realize that there’s a reasonable chance that Apple users blocking ads will take ads to the same place Flash went: The trash can.<p>The web sites that figure out a different business model will beat those that block iOS user who block ads. The newspapers that play along with iAds will beat those who try to serve ads through HTML.

There are integrations with R, Python, Julia, C++, Stata, the command line, and more.<p>To ask an intentionally over-simplified question: if the key value add of Stan in the functionality and approach -- why bother with the overhead of an external DSL? Why not use an internal DSL -- e.g. borrow data structures and/or syntax of another language?<p>Arguments for an external DSL are, hopefully: cross-language portability and domain-clarity for people.<p>But how does this play out if you want to support multiple languages and interop?<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m using Python, for example, and want to build up a model programmatically. The example at <a href=""https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan</a> shows using a heredoc. That&#x27;s simple and easy to start.<p>However, a big downside of a plain-text DSL is that it can be hard to manipulate programatically. To do that, each language implementation has to be &#x27;business&#x27; of converting to and from text. This reminds me of the &#x27;SQL&#x27; problem ... many language SQL wrappers spend considerable time munging text. Ug.<p>Given my bias towards data-oriented programming, I see another approach: why not use a rich data structure language (other than plain text) as the foundation?<p>Why not edn, for example? If the LISPy nature of that is not preferred, then why not something else?  (Does the C-community have some kind of generic data description language? I wouldn&#x27;t recommend JSON necessarily but that would be better than a hand-rolled DSL, in my opinion.)<p>Here&#x27;s why I recommend starting with &#x27;rich&#x27; data as opposed to parsing text...<p>I&#x27;m not saying human DSLs are bad. I&#x27;m just saying they don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be the foundation. If you want a human external DSL, great -- but why not convert the human DSL to a canonical data structure? Then build everything around the data, rather than build everything around the text format?",1442687729

Nobody is forcing content creators to create content without their consent.<p>>  But all did labor for the benefit of another without recompense, which is heinous enough without added abuse on top of it.<p>I do plenty of labor for the benefit of others without recompense: I volunteer. Again, it&#x27;s not about labor without recompense, it&#x27;s about force.

Every show in a TV series or movie is an advertisement for the next show or installment. Every book is an advertisement for its sequel. Every blog post is an advertisement for the next blog post. Every blog post, Facebook comment, video, or friend telling you about a product is an advertisement for that product. Many of those aren&#x27;t paid advertisements, but many secretly are.<p>If you want to include those things in your definition of advertising, fine, but let&#x27;s be clear here: that&#x27;s not what most people here are talking about. Ad-blockers don&#x27;t block those things.<p>That&#x27;s certainly not the definition of &quot;advertisement&quot; I use, either. I have no problem with individuals asking me to check out their thing. It&#x27;s entirely a different thing for someone to tie this request in with a piece of content in a way that isn&#x27;t easily separable, using psychologically studied manipulation techniques to invade the very chemistry of my brain, and decrease the quality of my overall experience while doing so, invading my space with their noise and light, telling me my girlfriend isn&#x27;t hot enough, my clothes aren&#x27;t nice enough, my penis isn&#x27;t large enough, I don&#x27;t make enough money. Fuck those people. There&#x27;s no way that this is subtle enough that I&#x27;m going to be okay with it.",1442686329

Breaks are therefore slightly longer (something like 5 minutes), but it means that you can watch a 2 hour movie with only one 5 minute break for ads, and a 5 minute break means that you can actually walk away and do something useful in the mean time.<p>Moving to the US was such a shock, I can&#x27;t believe people here just put up with this shit, it is impossible to focus on what you&#x27;re watching when it&#x27;s interrupted literally every 5 minutes.",1442686282

Theoretically, they can achieve good efficiency by performing program transformations (e.g. with abstract interpretation).

Rejection means that someone else doesn't believe enough in what you're doing to bet on you. It could be a failure to communicate on your part, but it could also just be something else completely random, especially when you're talking about a highly selective accelerator like YC.<p>To me, rejection is almost a non-event. If you're doing something worthwhile, you're going to see a lot of rejection. Not everyone can get on board with what you're doing. That's okay. Other people will get what you're doing and believe in you (unless you haven't shown anything... gotta give folks a reason to believe in you, after all).<p>That said, I understand your point (learn. move forward.)

4792288,comment,4788717,4789797,2,0,irahul,,,"> To show a little Ruby coding style. The convention in Ruby is to favour lots of concise little routines over big-ass ones.<p>Writing small, concise components(classes, methods, functions, modules...) is a generally a good practice in any language. However, moving i % 3 in a separate method is not a good practice. As another commenter pointed out, your names are hardly apt. It would better serve to name them fizz?(multiple_of_3) and buzz?(multiple_of_5). But even then, if all fizz? is doing is i % 3, let it be inline. True that in the future you might need additional processing for fizz?(not for this particular eg; I am talking real world), but re-factor it when you need it. It's not like if you have i%3 inline, it makes it harder to re-factor it into a fizz? method later.<p>Also, since you are talking ruby conventions, shouldn't your predicates be named multiple_of_3? instead of multiple_of_3?",1353037463

You cannot use something as a currency if:
- it can be manufactured easily
- it can change value from one day to another
- it is not dense in physical space (i.e. you do not need to carry buckets of it to buy something).<p>The paper money clearly does not respect ANY of these principles nowadays. The FED can print (and does) as much as they want to buy back toxic assets (remember the Krugman clown advising after the Net bubble in 2001 that we should create a housing bubble to stimulate the economy ? That really worked well for everyone, did it not?). The US Dollar is constantly losing value versus Gold since its parity was dropped for good in the 70s, and now you have such a galoping inflation than looking at movies 30 years ago make you feel old: then the bad guys were asking for ""a million dollars"" as something highly valuable/desirable, while nowadays if you do not cross the billion mark it is not considered as much anymore (Austin Powers made this very good point in a clever way).<p>Why do you think China is buying all the Gold it can currently to replace its stinky dollars?",1353036238

But I think maybe thats sort of a healthy sign. Because theres a point at which you can conclude that you're not crazy at all, then you probably are. It's sort of a recursive thing.""<p>At the risk of invading Elon's personal life, one could go further and investigate his father Errol Musk, who was an electrical & mechanical engineer back in South Africa, to see if there is a biological explanation for any potential personality disorders.<p>Elon said this about his father: ""Quite an astute engineer, although he's gone a little crazy later in life. I don't think he has all his cookies in the jar.""

I have no idea, but I think that he's a very logical person with life experiences that makes him a huge risk taker. For example, he tweeted briefly about the benefits of near death here: <a href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/152394000857448448"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/152394000857448448</a> On his google plus about page, he wrote ""Not dead yet"" on his bragging rights section. 
So really, his worst case scenario is dying. That's his mental trick of making so many crazy risky decisions, as long as they are based on logic. That mindset cannot simply be attained by anyone, you have to experience near-death to truly get it. Mike Lazerow is another good example of such an entrepreneur. Background Story: <a href=""http://www.lazerow.com/2012/06/a-new-beginning.html#tpe-action-posted-6a00d834558cdf69e201761513a25c970c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lazerow.com/2012/06/a-new-beginning.html#tpe-acti...</a><p>Also he thinks that people should be less risk averse (8m10s) because even if they fail, it's not like they're going to starve.

I honestly have no idea, just pure speculations.<p>So yeah, I hope that helps enlighten a little bit of how Elon can be such a risk-taker.",1353036221

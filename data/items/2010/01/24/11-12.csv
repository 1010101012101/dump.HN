Maybe the owner simply wanted to do something cool.</i><p>So doing something cool means intruding on other people's rights? The threshold must be getting really low these days.<p>Really, people should start paying attention to the online world, and what does ""property"" mean in such a context.<p>And if your online presence on a social network is so fragile (since, after all, Facebook is a business and the users don't really have lots of implicit rights) ... than there should be national campaigns against it (after all, your online profile being mismanaged could cause some people more harm than smoking, so why the discrimination?) ... not to mention that people think of Facebook as a ""common carrier"" which couldn't be further from the truth.<p>Isn't it easier to just play nice and stop acting like a douche bag?<p>> <i>It's an URL, not a wife.</i><p>It isn't just any URL, it's the link to your online profile. Your friends might have you bookmarked, Google might have you indexed by that URL.<p>It's like saying domain names like ""sex.com"" aren't worth anything. Well they do.",1264334022

I don't care at all about any advanced features -- just basic reporting and whether it will be able to wake me up at an opportune moment each morning.<p>It isn't entirely clear to me at this point whether I'll be able to do that without paying a monthly fee. It sounds likely that this may be possible, but I'd prefer to be sure before I buy.<p>Hopefully their website will clarify what is free and what is not before they begin shipping devices.",1264332747

It's a free app so sales aren't a factor. I did get an email from somebody who liked it about 10 minutes after it popped up in the market, so there are at least some users out there.<p>3. The built-in widgets are fine for my purposes, although I only needed a few buttons and a text view. For testing I set up a bunch of virtual devices in the emulator with different screen sizes and OS versions, and I didn't have any problems. I was able to stick to Android's layout managers which do a decent job of adapting to different resolutions. (And I'll be interested to see how Apple deals with future higher-resolution devices, since most iPhone UIs use absolute pixels).<p>This is just a hobby for me so I have the luxury of focusing on what I enjoy more, which is Android by quite a bit. Of course if I had a plan for an app that I expected to make a lot of money, I'd have to go with the iPhone.",1264332166

1073208,comment,1072801,1073198,0,0,daeken,,,"The current open source managed OSes are really very different from each other, with only small bits of overlap.  You really only have a few contenders at the moment: SharpOS, Cosmos, and Renraku.  Of those, SharpOS (GPLv3) and Cosmos (BSD) are C#, and Renraku (CDDL) is Boo.<p>SharpOS's goals were never particularly clear (they seemed to be building a full OS), but the project seems to be largely dead; they're now a part of MOSA (I'll get to that part in a moment) though, so I'm curious to see where that goes.  Cosmos is making progress, but it's not intended as an OS, but rather a set of components you can connect together to make your own OS.  Renraku is still fairly new (about 7 months old now, although it's fairly far along) and is intended to be a full OS, when all is said and done.<p>MOSA is the Managed Operating Systems Alliance, and originally was intended to be a compiler (JIT and AOTC) and a set of specifications for managed OSes to work together.  However, at this point they're building their own default kernel into it.  Interestingly, they're diverging greatly from the existing managed OSes by using separate address spaces.<p>At this point, the field is young enough that I think the more people trying things in different directions, the better.  There are a lot of unanswered questions, but the more approaches people try to take, the better off we'll all be.<p>I will say that the primary reason that Renraku is not MOSA-based (despite me being involved in the very early days there (although I didn't end up doing much)) is that they're solely C#-focused, like SharpOS and Cosmos.  Renraku is pure Boo, which gives us a flexibility that's we believe to be impossible using C#.  Even though we have to do many things ourselves, we think this gives us an advantage that will carry us through to v1 in a few months, and a usable managed OS in 2011.",1264331894

If you read through their paper (<a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/projects/sikuli/sikuli-uist2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/projects/sikuli/sikuli-uist2...</a>) you'll find more practical examples of what can be done with this type of system.<p>One such example is to track real time images of a webcam pointed at a baby and using Sikuli to watch for a yellow dot placed on the baby's forehead.  Another is to track movements of something across the screen; in this case a bus moving along Google maps.<p>I agree that there are better ways to do most of the things in their examples and that they should probably re-work their videos a bit, but just because this system doesn't solve your problems the way you want it to doesn't mean its useless.",1264331862

246266,comment,245706,246253,0,0,dhotson,,,"Ah yep, dictionaries are pretty similar to objects in this sense. Mostly just a matter of notation.\nI often use dictionaries as a poor man's object.<p>It could be kind of cool to have proper objects with methods to interact with them. You could use code reflection to figure out what verbs are supported.",1216083144

246264,comment,245671,246179,0,0,benreesman,,,"Addressing someone like a tardy child (I'm not mad, just disappointed) is a reliable way to inflame the discussion. I don't think I will respond if you phrase any further replies like that.<p>The claim that ""dynamic typing is incompatible with performance"" is considerably stronger than what I said (and I would contend belies an imprecise if not misguided notion of ""dynamic typing""). That being said, for people interested in using a mainstream platform to develop their applications, the JVM offers a number of extremely productive ""dynamic"" languages none of which perform as well as Java across a broad spectrum of activities. I think you will find it telling that the engineers at Facebook (who are world-class) chose to implement this system in Java.<p>Optional type annotations are a wonderful idea and I am optimistic that someday the tradeoffs we mark around performance and convenience can be granular and addressable at a lexical level in a single file. Until then, the mix of a JVM scripting language and code written in native Java calling each other trivially is pretty damn close.<p>Now I invite you to write a similar system using SBCL, if you enjoy debugging inexplicable concurrency failures. Or maybe you'll use Actionscript 3? I hear it has optional type annotations. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go work for the Man on dreary accounting software.<p>Fail.",1216082716

You could go the OO route, or just use dictionaries, e.g.<p>stairwell = { descr:""You're in a stairwell. There are footsteps echoing from above."", exits=[('up', rooftop), ('down', basement, locked=True)], items=[scrap_of_paper] }<p>This is not actually very different from the approach taken in the Lisp link.",1216081059

246243,comment,246115,246188,0,0,silencio,,,"Personally having been to WWDC a couple times now, I'd think that it wasn't all too inappropriate to include in the cost. It is a very useful resource for pretty much any Mac/iPhone developer, and I know many who consider the sessions, the networking, and sitting down with engineers to talk over things to be worth more than what they paid for the conference. And to be honest, I don't think they missed the point much by including the cost of icons as well. It's part of the application. Some may do it in-house, others will pay for work. To not count it as part of the app is fairly unreasonable...what else would you be doing if you needed icons? Making your own? (Not always the best idea, and for some will waste more time for an inferior set of icons vs. just buying a decent set.) And well...if the RAM helped them be more productive, then so be it.<p>Maybe I would have had a separate ""Optional costs, but ones we really thought were justified/important for what they gave us"" category for those three that people seem to be taking the most offense from. Sure, <i>you</i> and some others may not be interested in spending $600 on icons or $3000 on a trip to WWDC because you don't need it for whatever reason, but many do. In fact, I'd say that would apply to a lot of apps on the app store now where I know/know of the developer(s), since I saw so many of them at WWDC with MacBook Airs.<p>It may be inaccurate to you, but I don't think it's that far off. Everyone's different, and this is just one case I don't think is that unique.",1216080047

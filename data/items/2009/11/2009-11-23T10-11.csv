The cameras revealed that every time he tried to help his work was immediately criticized and often redone afterwards by the wife.

Paul, you're mixing up here what I would call ""savantism"" with intelligence.

Who would be more afraid, in your scenario, between the physicist and a Cantonese scholar?<p><i>if [Finland] seems that much more socialist than the US, it is probably simply because they don't spend so much on their military</i><p>Exactly.  So it's not about dismissing Socialism (especially since all modern countries operate on both Socialistic and Capitalistic principles), as much as making an argument as to what the upper tax bracket should be.  And for that, I would look at companies that have tremendous bonus systems.  (I won't exhibit the obvious.)  Are they more productive?  Do they take more risks?  What are the benefits and consequences of those risks?

7440386,comment,7435720,7440333,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> I guess overall I&#x27;d see this as actively harmful. What&#x27;s important is the rights of users; the rights of software developers to harm users are not rights worth saving.<p>Is freedom of economic value?  If it is, then a proprietary spinoff must offer enough value to not only make up for the license cost (vs free download) but also to make up for the loss of freedom.<p>If freedom is of economic value, then end users can protect their own interests.<p>With the GPL you have a very different danger, which IMO is actually worse regarding loss of freedom.  It goes something like this:<p>1.  Company offers GPL software and sells license exceptions.<p>2.  To do this they require code contributions be signed over to them with exclusive rights and ownership.<p>3.  One day they decide that the GPL version isn&#x27;t benefitting their business anymore, and they go fully proprietary.  They release a new and improved version with compelling features under a purely closed source model.<p>With BSD-licensed software this can&#x27;t happen because you can&#x27;t start at #1.",1395370722

7440381,comment,7435720,7437008,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> I believe freedom of one person ends where freedom of another person starts.<p>Nobody will disagree with that.  The question is where to draw those lines.<p>> Freedom to steal, freedom to kill, freedom to harm are not seen as positive things.<p>As Cicero pointed out (in &quot;De Republica&quot;), these things would prevent humans from living together in cities.<p>I am a classicist.  I look back to Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero far more than I do Locke.  As far as I see it, the goal of the economy is to serve the household, not the other way around.<p>> A single member of parliament&#x27;s belief that a measure was injurious to his own constituency (usually simply his own estate), even after the act had already been approved, became enough to strike the act.&quot;<p>And yet Quakers have shown an ability to make a universal veto work.  The key thing though is what you pointed out: universal vetos weaken central authorities and return the power to small regional entities where people can more easily work together.  This is a <i>good outcome.</i><p>The question really is how to define Freedom.  Stallman tries to follow in FDR&#x27;s footsteps of four freedoms.  But in both cases you have logic which then requires centralization as a matter of policy, and then freedom in the service of freedom becomes self-consuming.<p>Here&#x27;s my radical idea:  freedom requires limits, to be sure, but freedom is defined by the space within the limits.  I.e. freedom is a matter of partitioning, physically or metaphorically, something in order to give people a right to control their own space.  The freedom which then matters is economic freedom, and by this I mean the right to engage in economic production and trade without micromanagement from outside.  To put it another way, it&#x27;s one thing to have to do the dishes.  It&#x27;s another thing to be told not only to do them but be micromanaged in how one must do them.<p>Evaluating software licenses from this perspective then gives one the sense that those licenses that the FSF is willing to call Free Software Licenses do not universally as a group deliver more freedom than proprietary software licenses.  The AGPL places many more restrictions on products and services delivered with the software than does the license for the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime library when obtained as part of development tools.<p>So the question is:  what can someone produce?  What are the limits there?  Who is making those decisions?  So I side with the BSD folks.",1395370629

The API gives a safe way, preferably with low overhead, to access resources that might be already being used. With the original Xbox, this was done to keep programming for the Xbox more or less the same as programming in DirectX on a Windows machine. Having comparable APIs makes porting significantly easier. The Xbox 360 maintained this paradigm.<p>If you consider the PIP type of gaming that Xbox One supports there&#x27;s no way a game can have direct access because it would be fighting the kernel. Instead you are actually coding against a virtual device so that the kernel can decide what instructions can actually be executed.",1395370431

7440333,comment,7435720,7440316,1,0,_delirium,,,"> Right, but I am talking about the right of software developers to largely work as they see fit<p>I guess overall I&#x27;d see this as actively harmful. What&#x27;s important is the rights of users; the rights of software developers to harm users are not rights worth saving. But furthermore as a developer who is not a large corporation, I don&#x27;t even see the advantage of letting my code be incorporated into the next version of Windows or Matlab or whatever without payment or reciprocity, as semi-frequently happens to BSD-licensed code (there is a ton of it in both Windows and Matlab). Whereas at least a portion of the people who held out for payment have gotten paid (both Windows and Matlab also include quite a bit of licensed and acquired code). If I was a large company open-sourcing a codebase where I wanted to foster a community of other vendors around it, maybe, but I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m a person who writes moderate-sized bits of stuff (mostly AI-related) that someone might incorporate into various applications. And if they want to do so, I&#x27;d like them to either: 1) reciprocate; or 2) pay me.<p>But as for the rights of software developers to work unhindered: Pragmatically, I do not think that software developers are, overall, well-intentioned, especially if you consider the overall profit-driven system they/we work within. Hence maximizing their freedom to screw people over is generally a negative, and certainly not guaranteed to align with the freedom of users to work on open platforms.

7440316,comment,7435720,7440264,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> I guess from my perspective I don&#x27;t see why I would agree to license my work under the BSD&#x27;s terms, unless I had already concluded it had negligible monetary value.<p>Because you want contributions from others and want to work in a vibrant community.  And if you are modifying a BSD-licensed project, you probably want to encourage others to maintain your code (what this means is you will, if you want to have a successful proprietary fork, contribute almost everything back, so as to cut your maintenance costs).<p>> The traditional answer is the capitalist one: because you paid me a license fee. An alternative hippie-ish idealist answer is the &quot;commons&quot; idea: because we both agree to dedicate our work to the commons, and everyone gets each other&#x27;s work for free.<p>I think that misunderstands the purpose of the commons.  Commons exist because there is value in pooling resources.  Commons of course, only work when there are benefits and contributions are aligned.  Here, maintenance costs are reduced by contributions, and you get access to the works of others.<p>Let&#x27;s look at how this works with regard to PostgreSQL.  There have been a number of proprietary forks in the past, including Illustra, Mammoth, Green Plum, EnterpriseDB, and more.  In general these have all prospered when they contributed back significant work to the community, but when they didn&#x27;t they found themselves cut off from community resources.  Of these 4, only two are alive today, and one of those is facing renewed competition from free a free alternative (Postgres-XC).<p>So you have a carrot and a stick.  The carrot is that you can make marginal changes around the edges for your target market, particularly if the community doesn&#x27;t want those changes, and you can release a proprietary product with that, using the work of everyone else.  The stick is that if you don&#x27;t contribute back, you will find yourself cut off from that free labor and in competition with it, and that competition is not one you can win.<p>> (It&#x27;s worth noting that this line of argument is on quite different grounds than what RMS argues, though. RMS is primarily interested in the right of downstream users to modify their own computer systems, not in game-theoretic choices of software developers.)<p>Right, but I am talking about the right of software developers to largely work as they see fit, which strikes me as the best definition I can find.  To do this, you have to have decentralized control and a movement away from a corporate-centered model.  In this regard, the BSD license is a better and more radical alternative regarding freedom than the GPL is, because it insists that freedom serve practice rather than the other way around.",1395369195

I expect that garage parking (and other enclosed vehicle storage) will increase, and work its way down through the socioeconomic ladder, as well as simple techniques such as automated plate covers.<p>I expect that we won&#x27;t see any kind of effective prohibition on corporate or private behavior, at least in the United States, but contend that various measures mentioned above are reasonably effective at curbing this as well. (This could be aided by amending laws to say that plates must only be visible while the vehicle is actively driving on the road.)<p>Ideally, privacy preserving laws, which recognize the fundamental role of anonymity in society would be enacted, but I find this unlikely to actually happen in the US.<p>Ultimately, there are limits on what people care about, and anonymity is one of the things that requires cover traffic and statistical noise to be effective. However, I do think there are things that concerned people can do to raise the bar on collecting information about individual - ie, use ZipCar, start services which bulk order things off Amazon and ship to a locker/mailbox facility, etc. These won&#x27;t necessarily stop someone looking in to what you&#x27;re doing, in particular, from tracking you, but they increase the difficulty sufficiently to make bulk tracking difficult (assuming wide enough adoption).<p>The fundamental problem, just like it is online, is that anonymity and signal mixing needs to be built in to the system, and that&#x27;s just kind of inconvenient. So it requires people to proactively do it, even when they&#x27;re not hiding, and tends to just not get done (often enough).",1395368174

I own my work. You own your work. But why should I let you use my work to create your work? The traditional answer is the capitalist one: because you paid me a license fee. An alternative hippie-ish idealist answer is the &quot;commons&quot; idea: because we both agree to dedicate our work to the commons, and everyone gets each other&#x27;s work for free.<p>But if you don&#x27;t reciprocate by also dedicating your work to the commons, why should I give your proprietary product a free license to use <i>my</i> product? Being a blue-blooded capitalist, you aren&#x27;t going to let me use your product for free; why do you expect better terms from me than you yourself are offering? If you expect me to buy a license for your product, it seems perfectly fair that I also expect you to buy a license for my product.

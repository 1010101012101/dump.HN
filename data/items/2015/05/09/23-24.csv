9518102,comment,9515137,9516801,0,0,mbubb,,,"Wow - still a bit painful to remember my first go around with this. What i am about to admit is damning enough to keep me unemployed for the forseeable future so hopefully no hiring managers are reading this...<p>I was a sysadmin and did the datacenter buildouts for the company. The task was to take the dev setup in Softlayer (on bare metal servers) and reproduce it in our racks.<p>The error was to take this somewhat literally. The bare metal servers that we leased from Softlayer were 2u boxes with redundant power supplies, Raid controllers and 10g networking.<p>I found a Supermicro configuration that almost identically matched and ordered 30 datanodes; 2 name nodes (this was back when Hadoop used the curiously named primary and secondary name nodes); and a server to launch jobs from.<p>We already had a Netezza in place and since that used Bladenetwork switches I decided to use the same as TOR switches with a beefier on as the Aggregation switch.<p>We decided to use Ubuntu as the OS and the Cloudera packages - but without the support or the console.<p>Every single one of those choices were mistakes. It is remarkable in hindsight that it worked at all.<p>The mistakes:<p>1) starting with the power supplies. Since they were redundant it dictated an A/B power setup in the racks. What this means is that you cannot use more than 50% of the power density because the entire rack is set to fail over. Each PDU has to be able ot keep the whole rack up so it alarms at 40% capacity. My using redundant powersupplies I was more than halving the amount of power i had at my disposal.<p>2) RAID. I hadnt yet read the excellent Hadoop Operations O&#x27;Reilly book which tells you why RAID is a bad idea for hdfs. Further buildouts included ripping out the RIAD card and JBODing the drives allowing Hadoop to properly use the raw disks.<p>3) 10G networking - because more is better right? Later after we hired talented networking folks I learned a bit about how important caching is in switches - particulary for Hadoop. My expensive monster Bladenetwork switches were falling over because the bursty traffic would saturate the switches. In addition I had the networking setup for a much more conventional network and we were doing the switch aware stuff in the config but had a wide open /16 as the network. I learned about properly segmenting to avoid uneccesary cross talk.<p>4) Ubuntu - never listen to developers. \n;)\nActually it was our default OS. CentOS works better for Hadoop I would later find out.<p>5)  Lack of support. Cloudera is expensive but - unless you are already an expert - worth it. We should have gotten help early on.<p>6) Hardware choices. Supermicro was a bad choice. Penny wise / Pound foolish. They changed hardware config and it was hard to get replacemnts, etc. Cant say enough good things about working with PSSClabs for hardware though. \nI already mentioned the switches. I learned about Arista switches which are amazing for this application.<p>By the time I left that company, I learned an enormous amount from really smart engineers that knew gobs more about Hadoop and netwrking than I did.<p>I think the number of datanodes was up over 200 and we had a lean 1u datanode from PSSCLabs with single powersupplies 12 drives JBOD with onboard flash for the OS. Bonded 1G networking running up to Arista TORs and mutliple Arita Agg switches in a leaf / spine topology.<p>It was a thing of beauty.",1431215250

9518093,comment,9504825,9518030,0,0,rmxt,,,"As I&#x27;ve indicated elsewhere in this thread, I am completely fine with both beat patrols and body cameras for reasons I&#x27;ve given elsewhere. (In short: the discretion that a beat cop uses in their daily patrol lends itself better to the legal ways of obtaining information, i.e., the path from casual interaction to suspicion to arrest is an unmuddled one if the police officer is acting appropriately. Body cameras are an extension of these daily interactions, and do not/would not capture more than the minimum amount of ancillary information.)<p>I agree with you: we expect and want police officers to be familiar with the communities in which they serve. However, a drone flying a mile in the sky over the entire city does nothing to further that familiarity. (To say nothing of their legality.) The familiarity should be person-to-person, socioeconomic group to socioeconomic group. Flying a drone in the sky only serves to stratify the position of the police and ostracize those whom they are obligated to serve. This is part of the larger issue of the militarization of local police departments. See the 1033 program.<p>I&#x27;ve read 1984 several times, and I fail to see the connection you&#x27;re drawing between proles and this situation. The only (admittedly superficial) parallel I can draw between this situation is telescreens and the desire for authority to be omnipresent. Or, at a minimum drones help give the aura of of omnipresence, which is generally enough in 1984 to keep proles and outer party alike in line.<p>EDIT: Thank you for continuing to argue in good faith.

Yes it&#x27;s technically different but the UX is virtually the same (and even easier with an SSO). You sign up once manually, then have to make several easy steps usually revolving just authorizing the 3rd party application to use your account.<p>Now i understand why many sites don&#x27;t want to use SSO&#x27;s, they lose control over their user base and get much less information from a registration via SSO than they would via their own registration form, and always the SSO providers (e.g. Twitter and LinkedIn) can always say you know what we don&#x27;t want to provide that service any more, and in many cases you can be left with no ability to recover a large part of your user base.<p>That said I haven&#x27;t seen many sites that Chrome cannot populate virtually their entire sign up page from memory, and like most stuff in Chrome it&#x27;s also (can be) shared between devices as long as you are signed into one. Heck not that i would advise it but Chrome can even store your credit card number &quot;securely&quot; although that option i believe does not replicate between devices (never used it myself, not crazy:)).<p>Yes sign up processes can be annoying, especially when they obviously unnecessary, but from experiences the sites that put everything behind a signup wall rarely have much content to offer in the first place, since sites that actually want to monetize their user based tend to have very easy signups in order to reduce drop out rate. Heck just look at payday loaners, their sign up is as short as possible to get some info about you for a credit check and that&#x27;s it, they don&#x27;t want people to drop off before they get a loan and every step increases the chance that they&#x27;ll figure out that taking one at 123514% APR isn&#x27;t the best solution for their financial shortcomings.",1431214193

9518020,comment,9516151,9516151,0,0,dmarble,,,"A couple summary quotes:<p>&quot;[W]hen [Dr. Kent] Berridge, a dedicated young scientist who was more David than Goliath, stumbled upon evidence in 1986 that dopamine did not produce pleasure, but in fact desire, he kept quiet. It wasn&#x27;t until the early 1990s, after rigorous research, that he felt bold enough to go public with his new thesis. The reward system, he then asserted, has two distinct elements: wanting and liking (or desire and pleasure). While dopamine makes us want, the liking part comes from opioids and also endocannabinoids (a version of marijuana produced in the brain), which paint a &#x27;gloss of pleasure&#x27;, as Berridge puts it, on good experiences. For years, his thesis was contested, and only now is it gaining mainstream acceptance.<p>. . . .<p>&quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s easy to turn on intense wanting,&#x27; he says, when we eventually sit down. &#x27;Massive, robust systems do it. They can come on with the pleasure, they can come on without the pleasure, they don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s tricky to turn on the pleasure.&#x27; He hadn&#x27;t expected his findings to turn out this way, but it made sense. &#x27;This may explain&#x27;, he later tells his audience, &#x27;why life&#x27;s intense pleasures are less frequent and less sustained than intense desires.&#x27;&quot;<p>== On mindfulness meditation: ==<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not that meditation makes the wanting go away. &#x27;What it is doing&#x27;, Berridge says, &#x27;is giving the more cognitive mind a way of distancing itself from the urgency of those wants. It&#x27;s a practised mental gymnastic. A want occurs, but because you&#x27;re so practised, you can recognise that want, appraise it, feel it all around, focus on that, and the feeling of urgency as a feeling, without engaging in it.&#x27;&quot;<p>== On controlling our desire/pleasure systems: ==<p>&quot;The strength of dopamine/wanting in an addict&#x27;s brain is so fierce that it is hard to conquer. ... Walter Mischel&#x27;s famous marshmallow tests told children that they could forgo one marshmallow for the promise of two if they waited a while. Mischel tracked the children in later life and found a link between self-control and success. The controlled kids had resisted the marshmallow by simply making a decision and moving on without further discussion. They turned away from it, or tugged their pigtails to distract themselves from allowing it to arouse their senses. The children who deliberated, or lingered over the marshmallow, were more likely to cave in. &#x27;It looks as though the best way of resisting is not to open the question[.]&#x27;&quot;",1431212838

For instance Naval Station Mayport has not had a carrier homeported there for years ever since the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) was decommissioned. So all of the infrastructure at the base dedicated to carrier-centric concerns could be shuttered and possibly save the taxpayers some money, but doing so would forestall the option of adding a carrier later, and would probably reduce the number of personnel assigned to the base.<p>Alternately you could <i>assign</i> a nuclear carrier to the base to make use of the infrastructure present, but you&#x27;d need to make further upgrades to handle nuclear carriers, and assigning a carrier to Mayport would necessarily mean removing it from Norfolk.<p>Guess which state&#x27;s delegation has successfully prevented the use of funds to expand Mayport&#x27;s carrier capabilities? Hint: They are north of North Carolina and south of Maryland.<p>Now a bill like a free trade bill is practically the definition of a bill easily tainted with parochial concerns. That&#x27;s the reason there was a similar outcry over NAFTA while it was being drafted, when &quot;experts&quot; at the time were stridently predicting the impending implosion of the American economy, with wording that would have made Steinbeck sound like a happy-go-lucky author.<p>It&#x27;s telling when the zeal over free trade turns even progressive icons like Bernie Sanders into racists that resort to turning Vietnamese (as one example) into a sub-class of humanity compared to Americans. It&#x27;s also telling when the worst accusation that can be laid against the proposal to date is that &quot;it&#x27;s still being negotiated in secret!!!1&quot;, as if that wasn&#x27;t also the method used to negotiate most major international agreements.<p>The final proposal may turn out to be bad, and in that case I&#x27;ll be the first to recommend vetoing the proposal as a whole. But simplified trade authority approval procedures are precisely the right thing to do, as otherwise you end up with &quot;ratification&quot; bills that ratify something completely different than what had been agreed, usually with a Ted Stevens-style &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; attached right on top.",1431212836

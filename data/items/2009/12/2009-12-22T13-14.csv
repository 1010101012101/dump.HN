They might not compete in the same way companies which innovate on their products do, but they're certainly not under-valued. Financials, on the other hand, are a bubble in which major shareholders have complete control of the legislative process in the US. Consider the power of the federal government to bail out those ""too big to fail"", and that bubble seems pretty unlikely to pop.",1261490250

It is also neat for backups - in fact, before I got my Mac and started using Time Machine, I used rsync for backups (and in fact used rsync.net for offsite backups).",1261488473

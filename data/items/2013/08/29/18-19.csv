Windows might live to 2063 supporting something custom that&#x27;s never worth the effort to port to a new platform, but this is very different from an operating system used by thousands of people.<p>Are new internal tools at your company written for Windows or are they browser based?",1377802788

If this <i>was</i> a big deal, he should have confronted Jobs about it in person.<p>Unfortunately, society at large does not really care about &quot;fairness.&quot; People have a tendency to blame the victim, and that victim would be <i>us.</i><p>People do not intrinsically value what we do. They value what we can do <i>for</i> them. To that end, it&#x27;s easy to understand why they would prefer the story of Jobs to the story of Wozniak. Saying that Jobs was not a coder did not significantly hurt Jobs. Jobs may have been an asshole, but he had enough charisma to go keep going. Saying that Jobs was not a coder hurt engineers because it pigeonholes us into the technical-only side of things. Woz did the engineering and hardware design. Jobs did everything else.<p>Ultimately, in any such situation, it is important to keep this kind of drama under the sheets. Most people are not like Jobs. Most management would not be able to deal with the fallout of these kinds of statements.<p>I know a lot of engineers IRL who resent Jobs because of these things. My response to them has always been: start your own business, because the more technical entrepreneurs there are out there, the less likely that a future Jobs figure would act the way that Jobs did.",1377802659

I may not like the new aesthetics, but they are certainly there.  Furthermore, the posters are powerful imagery (value is added) to those who hate MLK.<p>2) Amount: The posters only excerpt a single frame of a much longer video.<p>3) Nature of original: The video is not abstract art... it documents a historically- and culturally-significant event.  This gives poster-makers broad latitude to do as they please.<p>4) Effect on market for original: Any argument that an MLK-Hitler poster is a substitute for video of the original speech is a non-starter and doesn&#x27;t pass the giggle test.  You would have to argue second-order effects, (that the posters ruin MLK&#x27;s image, and therefore reduce demand for all things MLK) and courts haven&#x27;t really gone for that (if they did, you couldn&#x27;t publish an unfavorable movie review that showed a still from the movie).

I wonder if it is possible to detect which one is the left or right one. Or remap them. Then I could remap one of them as ESC for vim, for example. That&#x27;d be rad.<p>I beta tested the keyboard (woot! I got in because a designer on it heard me complaining about keyboards to a friend!), and funny enough internally the keyboard does know that there is a difference, and from what I understand talking to someone on the team, they originally allowed for some limited remapping abilities of it. From what I gathered the feature confused people and got cut at least in the version of firmware I was handed for it. I am not sure what the situations will be like on release of course!<p>As far as the computer is concerned though, it isn&#x27;t like with shift where keymaps defined for two of them (AFAIK at least), to make &quot;space&quot; work properly I imagine the keyboard has to report either key as the scancode for &quot;space&quot;.<p>IIRC they allowed remapping one of the keys to delete or backspace or something like that, it was actually pretty useful for coding.

My biggest beef is the use of numbers in a way that is annoying and frustrating (as a student of statistics). A few illustrative points by way of comparison to Seattle:<p>1. Seattle&#x27;s tech scene is much larger than Atlanta&#x27;s. Atlanta might have a top heavy average salary, but I guarantee that the upper bound is much higher in Seattle.<p>2. Comparing cost of living so directly and broadly applying it as a corrective factor to salary is misleading and useless for a number of reasons. For example, I doubt many people could get by in Atlanta without a car (without some serious effort). Conversely it is quite easy to live a carless or car-diminished life in Seattle.<p>3. Combining my previous two points: Upper bounds are important. At some point adjusting salary with cost of living conversions doesn&#x27;t make sense. It is totally dependent on the individual concerned, but if somebody makes 107k in Seattle, that isn&#x27;t necessarily the equivalent of 84k in Atlanta at some point you start to cover the basic cost of living and whatever you make above that is excess. It&#x27;s probably a little higher than 100k for people with families, but probably not by much.",1377802044

I think PG&#x27;s statement has definitely been taken out of context and blown out of proportions.<p>I did have a foreign accent but thankfully not so thick to make it non-understandable. I received a similar feedback from PG before the demo day and I worked on it.<p>As an entrepreneur, you can do two things - either take it as an insult and leave it or as constructive feedback and work on it. In fact, I setup an office hour with Garry to just work on this.<p>For eg: in India, the word programmer is pronounced as prograamar (the stress is at the end) vs pro-grammar in US. And similarly, path is pronounced as &quot;paath&quot; as opposed to &quot;p-a-th&quot; (stress on &#x27;a&#x27;) here. These are definitely minor things that you have to tune (and I&#x27;m sure PG was referring to a much more thicker accent people had) which will make it easy for people to follow what you are saying.<p>If you didn&#x27;t work on this, the investor would  miss what you had said and then after a couple of seconds would realize.. &quot;oh. you said programmer, okay&quot;, the train of thought is lost, you continue with the slides and it repeats again. And that&#x27;s not okay.<p>After you have identified a product-market fit in your startup, I have realized everything is about convincing, every damn thing. \n-- convincing the guy to join your company\n-- convincing the customer to buy your product\n-- convincing a new investor to make a bet on your company\n-- negotiating/convincing for compensation and pay package\n-- convincing someone to continue to stay in your company\nand so on..<p>It&#x27;s almost like I can prefix a huge percentage of my work with the word &quot;convincing&quot; and it would all make sense. When that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s better to ensure at least your statements are eloquent and of high clarity that doesn&#x27;t require repetition (unless of course the person wasn&#x27;t listening). You are just going to improve the odds and that&#x27;s what a startup is all about - do things that increase the odds of success.<p>It&#x27;s a constructive feedback that I believe entrepreneurs should work on for their own good. It&#x27;s not equivalent to sounding like an american but if you have a foreign accent (which you will if you aren&#x27;t born here), please work on it to ensure what you say comes off clearly. That&#x27;s it.<p>And YC clearly has no bias based on accent. I know <i>tons</i> of immigrant founders who are part of YC. In fact, 3 of my classmates (all from India) are a part of YC.",1377801964

He could have created his own accounts with higher-level clearances, or set up his own smartcard for logging in to some other person&#x27;s account, etc.<p>It may seem like poor design, but it is understandable why things might have been set up like that.  In the first case, it is because the admins need to be able to solve problems that happen in a variety of security contexts / levels, and the overhead of defining a second set of policies governing the admins was just too high.  In the second, it would be because someone has to be able to set up credentials and that there are a lot of systems for which credentials must be set up, making it hard to impose restrictions.  There is also the matter of audit logs -- it might not be so bad to allow an admin to transition to whatever security level if each transition is logged.<p>I suspect that much of the NSA&#x27;s computer security is devoted to ensuring that people do not accidentally leak classified information, and that preventing insider attacks is done at a higher level (the clearance process, random audits, etc.).",1377801639

Of course Common Lisp, which is similarly a mix of paradigms, has a chance to make a great comeback too.

Large institutions with sensitive information, whether public or private, generally don&#x27;t know or trust their lower level employees (and a sysadmin is &quot;lower level&quot; in this context).

A typed language&#x27;s implementation is obviously not required to stop with ensuring that the types check out. It can use the information so derived to do further things, including introduce optimizations.<p>Insofar as Typed Racket does optimizations based on types it&#x27;s hard to see how it can be <i>completely</i> orthogonal to type checking, on pain of the optimizations being potentially incorrect; insofar as the optimizations are based on types, it&#x27;s a use of a type system beyond what Typed Clojure currently offers.",1377799573

The mining calculators all (most) account for a future decline in the profitability of mining, but &quot;0.61 per year&quot; apparently can&#x27;t accurately characterize how quickly the difficulty has ballooned and how much you need to upgrade your hardware to keep up the pace.<p>I started with nothing but the computer on my back.  I learned about bitcoin, started CPU mining when they were worth pennies.  Accumulated 220 bitcoins through solo mining when blocks were worth 50 coins and learned to trade them at exchanges.<p>I bought and sold enough times that I was willing to add $50 to the mix.  I made some bad trades and cashed out my $50 anyway in spite of the bad trades as $300, then bought in for $50 again.<p>Eventually I had 22BTC and the price was about $12.50.  BFL was making their announcements about &quot;shipping soon&quot; again and I decided to take a risk and lay out $300 worth of bitcoins in mining equipment.  I never paid $312.  In fact I had already walked away with $300 separately.<p>Time passes.  The price of a bitcoin approaches $300.  I kick myself; I could have paid off all my student loans.<p>Time passes.  The price of bitcoin is back around $115.  It&#x27;s getting harder to mine.  I can&#x27;t get back my 22BTC (or even close) with the GPU miner I&#x27;m using now.  The community started to express doubt that BFL customers will get what they bargained for, as shipping deadlines continue to slip.<p>I keep my eye on the build queue and realize I&#x27;m next.  I pay $200 (USD) to get 30% faster miners.  At this point my GPU output is next to nothing.  I&#x27;m making $6 twice a month... once a month.<p>Jalapenos arrive a few days ago.  I plug them in (eventually) and I&#x27;m now mining 0.12 per day.  I should have my $512 in about 43 days at the current difficulty.  Next difficulty is estimated to be x1.32 on September 4, much sooner than that.  I may never make back my $512 if this pace keeps up.  Hopefully the exchange rates can keep pace with the difficulty.<p>At a minimum I should have made back my BTC investment in USD if the whole market does not go bust before then.  Maybe it&#x27;s 80 days.  I still started with nothing and never risked more than $50, except for &quot;play money.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s all shoulda coulda &quot;would have been&quot; but you can see that 220 or even 22BTC is again well out of my reach.",1377799555

A man is stronger than a woman, therefore he has a natural right to dominate her.  The same goes for children.  A child has no right to anything from its parents, because if you must depend on someone else, you wouldn&#x27;t be free to obtain it in the absence of other people.<p>But dependence is how we are born into the world.

My comment is saying that their data is wrong (or cherrypicked) and their attempt to disprove any correlation doesn&#x27;t hold water.<p>What I would expect to see would be a scatter graph showing all the countries in the world with guns on one axis and homicides on the other axis - that would make the article a bit more scientific rather than just cherrypicking a few countries. Most of their argument seems to be based on the fact that Russia has a high homicide rate and they have banned handguns. However we all know that Russia has law and order issues.<p>EDIT: I just did a quick search, and it seems there are graphs of homicides vs gun ownership for all countries, e.g. <a href=""http://www.neontommy.com/news/2012/07/doing-math-guns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neontommy.com/news/2012/07/doing-math-guns</a><p>So it certainly does look like gun ownership isn&#x27;t correlated to homicide rates. However that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that gun control is a bad idea. Does gun control reduce homicides when you control for other factors? The article is arguing that it does not, but my argument is that Canada vs USA shows that it does.",1377799263

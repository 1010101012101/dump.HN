Zero is such a pervasive number in software development that, like it or not, you're bound to use it in lots of places.<p>Even if we assumed that one-based indexing was a good thing, many languages -VB prominently- can't seem to make their mind and use a single convention through: arrays may be one-based, but collections are 0-based, and when you start having to interface with libraries written in other languages or APIs, you're left walking on eggs, always wondering if you're not off by one somewhere.",1308734680

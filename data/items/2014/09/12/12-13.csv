Instead, I use an old document from 20 years ago called The Unofficial Doom Specs.<p>That brings back memories of playing around with WAD files, pulling out graphics and palettes, reading level data and drawing it with LineTo() and MoveTo() calls, and running into all the limits of a 16-bit C compiler (Turbo C)...",1410526766

Remember too that there are a lot of parameters for the matching algorithm here (<a href=""https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu/blob/master/dejavu/fingerprint.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu/blob/master/dejavu/finge...</a>) which allow you to trade off accuracy, speed, and storage in different ways. I&#x27;ve tried to document it throughly.<p>Finding duplicates is a great one! Actually generating a checksum for each audio file (minus the header and ID3 tags) and adding this as a column in the songs table for all the different filetypes Dejavu supports (mp3, wav, etc) would probably be the best way to do this.<p>I say this because so many songs today are built on sampling. Mashups and EDM music often samples from other work, and as such, the fingerprints <i>and</i> their alignment can be shared across different songs. Something more clever like seeing the percentage of hashes by song that are the same and comparing to a threshold might do the trick, though.<p>Happy hacking, and feel free to send in a PR! :)",1410526650

Wonder which one finance will recommend?<p>This is from §890 (1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure [1]. It&#x27;s €250,000 per violation of an injunction, and if that doesn&#x27;t suffice to enforce the injunction, the court can also order coercive detention (i.e., putting you in jail). Essentially, it&#x27;s the German equivalent of dealing with contempt of court in case of an injunction; it&#x27;s not strictly a fine, it&#x27;s a coercive measure, one that can be escalated.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_zpo/englisch_zpo.html#p3369"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_zpo/englisch_zpo....</a>",1410526519

118640,comment,118393,118393,0,0,jksmith,,,"What strikes me about sql is that new programmers think even the smallest shrinkwrapped desktop app that persists data has to ship with a db engine with a sql interface. The ultimate result is all this modelling that's done to generate SQL for your interfaces using some fancy toolkit. The problem with this is that it creates an appearance of separation by generating a bunch of business objects for you. But it still encourages designing interfaces with data access in mind = monolithic development.<p>SQL is especially good for those times when you do not have all the answers for the questions that may be asked of your data. But if you already know all the ways your data will be queried, what's the point?",1203391244

118638,comment,117435,118564,0,0,yters,,,"By saying consciousness is a pattern in the flux of matter, you are echoing my point that consciousness can't be based on the particular matter.  So, if you then think consciousness is the pattern, shouldn't two instantiations of the same pattern be the same consciousness?<p>Sorry we're going in circles here, but I do not understand your jump in logic.  We aren't talking about identity in terms of how to pick a particular consciousness out of a set.  We're talking about the subjective experience of ""I"", and I have a hard time seeing how any of those identifiers give me my sense of continuity.<p>It is also completely impossible for me to consider the ""I"" to be an illusion, because I am involved in the very act of trying to escape myself.  It is just as incoherent as saying there is no truth, or the law of non contradiction doesn't hold.  You can tell yourself such things if you want, but you can't do so in an intellectually honest way, since intellectual honesty presupposes these concepts.",1203391043

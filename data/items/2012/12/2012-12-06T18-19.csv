And one day you might realize all that running, all that effort exerted, it got you no where.<p>You might also arrive at the final destination realizing that your existence and your way to exist is but merely at the mercy of the system.<p>Your friends that kept doing the same things? With the same blank expressions?<p>You're not better than them. I thought I was, but the final destination is to realize you're not.<p>You exist because they exist.

There will be no roads for you to travel, no places for you to tour, no joy for you to find.<p>In all, there's no blackness for your star to shine.<p>You have to accept that. And in doing so you might find that the steady ones, the one that did everything they were told, might end up being the ones that have the most. Compared to you, the one that gave up to always pursuing something else.<p>Because that's actually the immature way of handling life. And that's the continually reaction I keep getting from people that's done the same thing. Thinking that the replacement of running for life is somehow worth something to keep telling others.<p>That if you're given the lucky opportunity to be born into an environment providing for a good life in the good part of the world, you should take that and make good on it.<p>Because others? In worse places, having to do worse things to survive. They would do every single possible thing short of dying to be in your position. Yet you chose to be a tourist.

4883164,comment,4882351,4882351,4,0,programminggeek,,,"TDD is awesome, if you have a codebase or a tech stack that makes it nice. TDD will quickly expose bad design through an unpleasant testing process. For example, slow tests, untestable code, or tests that you ""always have to rewrite/maintain"" are problems that only show up when you try and TDD your code that isn't designed to be testable.<p>TDD doesn't work well if you don't design your code to be testable because you very quickly become frustrated by the problems TDD uncovers.<p>1. Slow Tests - If your tests are taking a long time, it's probably because your code isn't written to be tested easily.<p>For example, if your code is hitting the database a lot and it starts to take minutes or hours to run your test suite, your code has a problem. For example, if your entities/models are coupled to an ORM like ActiveRecord, testing those is going to suck because they probably sholdn't be coupled to an ORM. Many people try to fix this by writing frameworks that make testing their code easier instead of writing better code that isn't tied to an ORM.<p>Tests should be fast. Most of the time they don't need to hit the DB. Slow tests make TDD suck. Avoid slow tests.<p>2. Untestable Code - I've run into this a lot and it sucks, especially in languages that lend themselves easily to untestable code (In my experience, that's PHP).<p>Until you try to test your code, you don't realize how untestable your code is. A lot of things that seem like reasonable design decisions are so untestable, that you end up doing incredibly lazy integration tests because to fix things you have to rewrite whole portions of the system.<p>I've been there and it sucks. The choice seems to lie between rewriting the whole system on the same platform to be testable one chunk at a time, or to rewrite the system in something that lends itself better to testing.<p>In either case, the answer is to take the time to learn how to write testable code. To start learning techniques like Dependency Injection. To practice writing portions of your system using TDD to see what works and what doesn't.<p>3. Maintaining Tests Sucks - Actually, if you don't want to maintain a test suite, don't write one.<p>At its core, your tests are a specification of how your system should work at a given time. When they start breaking it means your system has likely changed, so either it should be fixed to match the specification, or the specification should be changed to match the appropriate system behavior.<p>At a fundamental level, tests aren't something you write once, they are something you constantly rewrite to keep them in line with what your system should be doing. Thus, when they are broken, you know that either your specs need to change or something in the code isn't working right.<p>Test maintenance is a price you pay for wanting higher quality software. It's the same kind of cost you pay in designing a building with blueprints. If people build a building without following the blueprints, it's not going to be the building that was supposed to be built. Tests are a living blueprint of your system. If you aren't willing to treat it that way, TDD isn't going to help you.<p>TDD isn't for everyone because not everyone is willing to make those kind of investments in code quality and maintainability. Also, TDD doesn't make your code better if you aren't willing to let it make your code better.",1354820093

Given Cook's operations background, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple is leveraging their cash/think different attitude  to try improving the efficiency of US based work forces. It doesn't seem like Cook's style to give away a competitive advantages for the sake PR. Apple's NPS (Net Promoter Score) is already extremely high. However, if he can shave a few more dollars off assembly, that protects Apple's margins, and that feels like a very Apple-like move.<p>* If Apple were to leverage new manufacturing methodologies, and they have been working on that for a few years, they _would_ spin it for maximum PR. That makes them looks good, and focuses the store on job creation, not supply chain improvements. I don't think it is coincidence Cook spoke to both NBC and Bloomberg in the same news cycle.<p>* That said: if Cook is being altruistic... So what? Apple has tens of billions of dollars in the bank.

They are valued quite differently.<p>The long term/short term is the maturity, and as you point out, some billions are probably treasuries, which are easy to trade (They don't break it down that I saw, Google does break it down into treasury bonds, etc).<p>However, some of it could be (and certainly is) instruments that they could transform into cash (hence marketable), but would take a significant loss on if they needed to do so quickly (< 90 days).<p>Calling that cash is simply false.
Let's stick with the simple fact: If they needed to transform that 92 billion in long term marketable securities into cash tomorrow, the percent chance they will get 92 billion for it is quite low.<p>If they need to transform it into 92 billion in cash in the next 6 months, the percent chance they will get 92 billion for it is quite high.",1354819754

You need to be able to improvise, because things will rarely go according to plan. You need the strength of will to stand back up even when it hurts. But even with this said, you'd be VERY surprised at how strong you can be when the need arises.<p>Not everyone is alike. Not everyone would appreciate this kind of life.

I cant remember the last time I bought a newspaper and I am also pretty sure that although blogs/twitter/whatever are a good addition they cant replace classical media. There is definately a need for the discussion for new sources of incomes for classical paper based medias as ad sales from their online publication wont cut it.

Because the high-voltage semiconductor switch has much greater resistance than the mechanical switch plus the low-voltage semiconductor switch, current flow through it is low.

Because of its relatively high resistance, it begins heating very rapidly. Then the high-speed mechanical switch is opened. Unlike the low-voltage semiconductor switch, which is only capable of standing off the voltage drop of the closed high-voltage semiconductor switch, this is capable of standing off the full voltage. Because no current is flowing through this switch when it opens, it is not damaged by arcing. Then, the high-voltage semiconductor switch is opened. This actually cuts the power.

Visible as 'lightning' going through the air from source to its ground counterpart. Transmission line effects limit the ability to send AC power long distances as the every time you switch the potential you generate magnetic fields and some of the energy is radiated off into the space around the wire.<p>AC has been more desirable to date because of a relatively easy infrastructure for converting it, and for sharing it on the same line. Transforming DC into AC is easily done by driving a generator set but for most things you'd want the genset to convert to 'standard' three phase AC and then re-use existing city wide infrastructure.<p>What bothered me about the article was that nowhere does it explain how you can make a DC breaker that can actually disconnect at those voltages. Since the dielectric constant is a function of distance, when the breaker first opens there is an arc because, the current really really wants to keep flowing. And the dielectric constant of ionized air is quite small. ""Regular"" breakers have a fan that kicks in once they get to a minimum distance apart to ""blow out"" the arc (it pushes it out to extend it and thus 'break' it, see the video here <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIkNY5xjy5k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIkNY5xjy5k</a> for how this works)<p>Anyway, would love to hear actually what it was they invented.",1354817769

4882888,comment,4878123,4879081,2,0,muraiki,,,"For anime in this genre, the pace can be a bit slow at times. This series is definitely character driven, as opposed to being event driven (although there are of course events that drive the characters). Since it's a bit of a ""coming of age"" story the focus is more on their development, and it takes a few episodes for the anime to set the background for the story and its players before it starts ""moving.""<p>One way to appreciate this approach is to contrast the storytelling techniques of western comics vs Japanese manga in the 90s (as they have since borrowed a lot from each other). The book ""Understanding Comics"" explains how in a western comic book each frame, while containing art, typically contains a lot of text. The story in western comics at the time was very textually driven, with the art as an accompaniment to help illustrate (ha!) what occurred in the text.<p>In contrast, manga could spend pages on images where the only ""text"" would be textual sound effects, devoting much space to creating an ambiance or mood. Furthermore, dialog might be more sparse and short, with greater reliance upon illustrating emotion. In fact, one of the reasons that the stereotypical anime style of big heads / large eyes developed was because of the realization that it was an effective technique to wordlessly convey emotions in characters (although this style actually originated in a western comic, Betty Boop).<p>Sorry, my memory is a bit fuzzy as to how Understanding Comics explained this all, but if you consider this difference in approach to storytelling, you might better understand what ""slice of life"" anime are doing. The intent isn't necessarily to pull you into a series of events and ""go somewhere"" immediately.<p>That being said, I heartily recommend this series. I had always found jazz interesting, although it was a bit too esoteric for me to know where to start. This series introduces jazz through some songs that are very easy to get into, even though they have a lot of depth. The end result of this, for me, was that I ended up taking up the sax and loving it. :)",1354817268

4882871,comment,4881831,4882597,9,0,rohern,,,"I am not trying to troll you; I mean this question honestly: Why do you care so much about being happy? I know that is the default goal of most people, but it seems rather like chasing gold at the end of the rainbow when you have no reason to think that the gold exists. Do you know of anyone anywhere ever who has spent the majority of their time 100% or even 80% happy? Was this person a holder of a medical marijuana card?<p>I think we would look down on someone who spent their life stoned. I do not see why this method of achieving the ""happy"" feeling as any less admirable than any other method. In the end, you are just striving to be chemically stoned, though one method uses outside chemicals to achieve this feeling and the other uses activities and experiences of a non-chemical nature. In the end you are just striving to put and to keep your brain in some chemical state. Does not seem like much to me.<p>Christopher Hitchens -- who has been on my mind much as the first anniversary of his death is in nine days -- once said that if offered a stress-free and blissful life, he would not want it, that he likes the feeling of burning the candle at both ends and the stress of things. Do not make the mistake of saying that he has redefined happiness for himself to mean the state of stress, because that is not what we are talking about when people talk about wanting to ""be happy"". They mean they want to feel good and joyous. Hitchens did not say that being stressed and attenuated through effort gave him joy, he only said that he preferred this state to anything else.  I sympathize with him on this point and take it from me, this is not the same as the ""happiness"" that most people are talking about. It is more like a state of satisfaction with occasional blimps of good humor mixed in with a great deal of unpleasant emotions. But, stiff upper lip and all that.<p>I think anyone who imagines that if they start a startup and strike it rich that, like a Sim, all their need meters will max out at green and they will feel permanently joyous is completely kidding themselves. This just is not how life goes. Life does not plateau at joy. It is a constant moving wave.",1354817103

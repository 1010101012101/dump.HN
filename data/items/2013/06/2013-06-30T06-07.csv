But that little inconvenience helped spawn an entire industry of URL shorteners and very simple image hosting solutions. Not necessarily a desirable development (especially URL shorteners), but we can&#x27;t deny that the 140-char limit triggered a great deal of innovation.<p>Think of the 10MB limit as a challenge.

A third party has a copy of your emails.  And we know email does not garner the same privacy protections as postal mail.<p>2. You need a domain name.  That system (DNS), as it is currently implemented (i.e., everyone setting their root zone to servers they do not control), is highly centralized -- few people maintain their own root zone, despite being easy to do.  Domain names are susceptible to false allegations copyright and trademark infringement by private parties, not to mention easy censorship by the US gov&#x27;t.  When you lose your domain you lose email.  (Though you shouldn&#x27;t have to: email works fine with IP addresses in brackets.)<p>So what&#x27;s the solution:<p>1. Get a reachable IP (e.g., through ISP) or get a VPS.  But if you get a VPS only use it to pierce NAT (how is left as exercise for reader - hint: supernode), not run a mail server.  Don&#x27;t store sensitive data like email on a VPS, or route sensitive data through it.<p>2. Use IP addresses not domain names.  Alternatively, set up your own DNS that is available as a peer-to-peer service, or have your email contacts use a DNS server and root zone you collectively maintain: free domain names that you control.  No one can censor your DNS (phonebook), except you.",1372575012

The one were 3 letter agencies collected and &quot;lost&quot; the tapes of nearby private surveillance cameras? The one were some people who couldn&#x27;t even fly a sports plane well flew a Boeing, which is so easy to handle and for which incredibly perfect simulators are in every mall, with precision into skyscrapers? The one where fires that turned steel into some kind of explosives curiously didn&#x27;t burn the passport of one of the attackers? Where explosions where not investigated, and the debris was shipped off to China?<p>When bad stuff happens to skyscrapers, or any building collapses for not entirely known reasosn, normally every <i>millimeter</i> gets photographed. It&#x27;s like a murder scene, you don&#x27;t just pack it up and destroy it. 9/11 didn&#x27;t even have a pretend investigation.<p>9/11 was informative indeed, but not about &quot;what would happen if we got rid of the spooks in our country&quot;, though the irony of such a conclusion is of course delicious in its own way. No, it&#x27;s rather a statement about how the sun revolves around the Earth if the party says so, and that&#x27;s about it. Nothing any scientifically thinking individual should have even one minute for in earnest. Fuck conspiracy theories and Alex Jones, all that was needed was thinking for yourself, watching news footage (as if there was a way to avoid it) with anything resembling an attention span, and listening to politicians while also reading between the lines. That is not too much to ask for a grown up individual in a supposedly democratic society.<p>So that you throw out that cliche of 9/11 having been an attack that, once and for all, proved that whatever &quot;security measures&quot; anyone could come up with are justified, and would &quot;prevent worse things from happening&quot;, <i>while talking about &quot;paying any attention or have a memory&quot;</i> -- I am not sure if I should find that funny or shockingly sad.<p>I see what you said, and raise you by &quot;<i>9/11 was information about the validity of the process by which the vast majority come to conclusions, and that all votes are not equal.</i>&quot; Which is so far from anyone that can be said in polite conversation that I usually keep it to myself, but I genuinely believe it. That year I realized I&#x27;m with mostly fools, stuck on this planet in a circus, and that all my previous confusion about &quot;how could something like the Nazis ever happen&quot; was just adorable.",1372574651

The real value of Heroku&#x27;s platform is that it greatly reduces operational overhead spend for businesses hosting their apps on the platform. Rather than paying consultants or dedicated ops personnel, your business can pay a premium for the PaaS and keep the dollars focused on value creating development activities.<p>Heroku&#x27;s target market is also not bootstrapped tech start-ups allergic to spending <= $100 a month. These projects have a huge failure rate and very low expected lifetime value. You would be a fool to try and target this market -- it&#x27;s tiny and unprofitable.<p>If you take a broader view of the world, there are tons of businesses with technology needs that already have profitable business models and steady growth but are not technology companies themselves. This is the huge market that Heroku is truly addressing. They know that these businesses turn to consultants or hire developers and empower them to drive the technology decisions. That&#x27;s why developer mind-share is so valuable to Heroku -- it&#x27;s not that they want you to host your next bootstrapped startup weekend side project on the platform, but instead they need Heroku to be top of mind when somebody with profitable technology needs hires you.<p>I would bet that applications starting on the free tier and seeing organic growth is a very tiny sliver of Heroku&#x27;s revenue. Most applications are built from business needs, not ideas. These businesses are not scared to spend when it solves their problems or grows revenue. $100, $1000, or even $10k a month is nothing when you find yourself in such a position.",1372573911

5964888,comment,5951589,5963083,1,0,kijin,,,"> <i>Wiki link to Murder_in_English_law</i><p>All I see is an RFC that (a) defines what counts as &quot;murder&quot; and (b) specifies what protocols the government should follow when murder occurs. AFAIK it doesn&#x27;t contain any sentence to the effect of &quot;persons MUST NOT commit murder&quot;, not even anything that amounts to &quot;persons SHALL NOT commit murder&quot;. So I stand by my claim that such a prohibition is an assumption behind the law, not the content of the law.<p>The Ten Commandments, on the other hand, definitely includes the clause &quot;persons MUST NOT commit murder&quot;. So do a lot of other religious texts. The idea that criminal law is comprised of a set of prohibitions, IMO, is a sticky residue from the days of theocracy when people thought there was a big guy in the sky who went around issuing explicit prohibitions.<p>> <i>a conditional moral imperative to obey the laws if there are any</i><p>I accept that ethics may differ in different situations, but only to the extent that general imperatives allow. Every conditional moral imperative (hypothetical imperative according to Kant) is an application of a general moral imperative (categorical imperative according to Kant). Therefore the proxy analogy still holds, and I don&#x27;t see any general moral imperative that can lead to the conclusion that I should obey whatever 51% of an arbitrarily delimited group of people say I should. The closest you can get is that the majority is likely to be right, but empirically, that&#x27;s a rather questionable assumption.<p>In my view there is no general moral imperative not to steal. That presupposes the concept of ownership, which, as you said, is problematic. Rather, I think there is a moral imperative to refrain from depriving people of things they hold dear, which is itself an application of the general moral imperative to respect individual human beings.",1372573528

5964883,comment,5964399,5964399,3,0,jaekwon,,,"Ah I have a thought about this. I have noticed for some time that Lessig walks a strange line on the issue of IP (intellectual property) and freedom & privacy.<p>Lessig believes IP is necessary & requires architectural changes to the internet to protect it. He is in favor of government monitoring to protect IP as long as it is done in accordance with the law, and he proposes a flawed mechanism (P3P) to protect your privacy.<p>----<p>Disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t had the time to scrutinize this guy. I&#x27;m merely writing down the ideas that have been crystalizing in my head the past year or so while encountering his books, talks, and such. I&#x27;m all ears to criticism.<p>----<p>First, consider his stance on IP. There is no denying, as evidence in reading over his book &quot;Free Culture&quot; ($16.00), that while he sees existing IP laws as having gone too far, IP must exist in order to protect the monetary incentive of the creator. While many people blindly agree with this justification for IP laws, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that many disagree, and also that he fails to weigh the evidence of whether IP laws actually promote progress in art and science. For Lessig, it is an assumption.<p>Second, consider his book &quot;Code&quot;.<p>Page 140 under &quot;Choices&quot; he writes, <i>&quot;I&#x27;ve argued that cyberspace will open up at least two important choices in the context of intellectual property: whether to allow intellectual property in effect to become completely propertized..., and whether to allow this regime to erase the anonymity latent in less efficient architectures of control. These choices were not made by our framers. They are for us to make now&quot;</i>. Here, I am paraphrasing, he is saying we have to choose between having complete trusted computing in handling our internet activities in order to prevent piracy, or we have to monitor internet activity and lessen our anonymity. His solution, on the same page, is to ensure pseudonymity, which is exactly what the NSA claims. Yet any hacker worth a dime knows the flaw in claiming that the NSA&#x27;s methods ensure pseudonymity.<p>Next, page 158 he writes, <i>&quot;It might be said that the principle ... is to ban all of these inoffensive and invisible searches. Perhaps that should be done. But ... imagine substitutions that protect the same value without sacrificing the benefit these technologies might bring.&quot;</i> Here he is defending blanket monitoring, as long as it is modified in some way. His idea of this modification is on page 160: <i>&quot;What is needed is a way for the machine to negotiate our privacy concerns for us, a way to delegate the negotiating process to a smart agent.&quot;</i> and the mechanism that he proposes is <i>&quot;P3P, ... an architecture within which users can express their preferences and negotiate the use of data about them&quot;.</i><p>Sure he admits that P3P has unresolvable problems. But his next sentence doesn&#x27;t sit well either. <i>&quot;... Imagine an architecture, tied to a market, that protects privacy rights&quot;</i> ...<p>The problem with all of his suggestions is that they simply don&#x27;t work. Either Lessig is ignorant about the nature of information, or he is deliberately suggesting red herrings to problems of the kind of NSA surveillance. You can&#x27;t fix that with a P3P or a market. You can&#x27;t even fix it well with encryption unless you&#x27;re using Perfect Forward Secrecy. I&#x27;ll give him the benefit of the doubt, but still... if you connect the dots, you may find that at worst Lessig is an apologist for the surveillance state, and at best offers no real solutions to the problem of internet privacy.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that while Lessig associates with Aaron in many ways, their roots could not be any more different. Aaron started within the law, helping creating things like RSS and Creative Commons, but over time he became more of an activist, and condoned more aggressive tactics of information freedom, as evidenced in his Guerilla Open Access Manifesto (2008)... <i>&quot;We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that&#x27;s out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.&quot;</i> On the other hand, Lessig staunchly supports the IP system, and fails to propose a system that Aaron would agree with.<p>----<p>- EOM",1372573414

All relate to medical problems. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m rabidly anti suicide - I am pro suicide rights - but I&#x27;d hardly call a net coercion. Can you explain this for me?
Grafton Bridge in Auckland has put up Perspex screens for suicide prevention (and the safely of those under the bridge) instead of nets. <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton_Bridge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton_Bridge</a>",1372572201

I should be able to write applications in Go (or C or whatever) and be able to use the official APIs in an officially supported way and without having to waste time screwing with shims and JNI.<p>And while I&#x27;m complaining about it, it sure would be nice if they would include POSIX support by default. It&#x27;s not like the code to do it isn&#x27;t largely already written and freely available.",1372572157

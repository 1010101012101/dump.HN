If the company is growing quickly then there are probably positions in the company that will exist soon or were just made that can provide you with very useful skills and knowledge. You may be able to do other things during the day instead of coding, which will probably reduce the amount that your work is taxing you, allowing you to work on side projects more. You may not want to move into a role with responsibilities that aren&#x27;t programming but as others have said the knowledge and experience you gain during growth is crucial to success, which you will learn even if the company doesn&#x27;t execute well. It will also help you know what qualities you would like in a co-founder,if you want one, or how you should approach starting something of your own.",1419184797

Employers want educators to provide job training, when that&#x27;s not what is supposed to happen in higher education.<p>In the 1990s (and probably earlier), a lot of for-profit educational institutions, in collaboration with a number of large tech companies, produced a lot of &quot;certifications&quot; which tried to fill this gap. It failed pretty miserably for everyone but the for-profit educational institutions.<p>What&#x27;s left? Most of the employers want to hire at a lower pay level than most of the qualified applicants are willing to take, especially since regular pay increases have dried up in many markets.<p>I&#x27;ve been on both sides of this coin, though. I know it&#x27;s difficult to hire people even if you have plenty of good applicants, because, even when you&#x27;re willing to train people on the specifics of the position you&#x27;re hiring them to fill, truly qualified applicants may not work out after 6 months.<p>In a perfect world (sometimes called &quot;once upon a time&quot;), companies take all of this into account and consider it a part of doing business. In the modern world, companies have found that they can get more work out of their existing employees and out of new-hires by behaving as if all training can be done on-the-job. You might give the new-hires a little less work to compensate for the extra load of learning the job, but the rest of the team has to make sure the job is still getting done AND train the new-hire.",1419183588

However i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good move (especially with the baby coming in 3 months!).<p>I should also mention that last week he told me they were planning on letting go of all but 2 of the developers that my framework replaced :( I felt safe with him around because I built it, but i&#x27;m not sure if they hired an MBA to replace him he would do the same math.",1419182963

In this world, abstraction is worse than worthless - it is a cost with no benefit.<p>In the real world, there are risks.  Bugs will be fixed, requirements may be changed, back end systems may be replaced or scaled, and so on.<p>Building things the &quot;right way&quot; is exactly like buying insurance against those future risks.  Business-savvy developers know how to estimate the probability and cost of the risk this code will face over its lifetime, and weigh that against what it would cost to build in extra code to mitigate those risks right now.<p>Thus, choosing the right level of abstraction and engineering overhead to add to a particular feature should be a series of decisions and tradeoffs, not just a determination that it&#x27;s always better to build the &quot;right way&quot;.<p>In my experience, developers tend to be overly confident in their ability to predict and mitigate future risks, and suffer severely from hindsight bias.

They still wasted days looking at other things until finally understanding that this behavior meant the CPU was working as if it had no cache at all.<p>Oh, and the constant complaints that the machines were slow when they were sistematically under 10% utilization?

However, my company was going through some rough patches and our raises/bonuses were dependent on the company performing well. I had already missed a raise opportunity so it would mean I would have to put in a total of 2 years before I had the chance to get ~3% raise (adjusted for inflation) when I could get a 20K bump in salary by switching - well that is exactly what I got when I went to another company.<p>Based on how everything happened, here is my personal take-away:<p>- In the current economic landscape, most big companies looks at all employees as being replaceable (my company did not even ask if they could offer anything to make me stay, even though I was hired specifically for a new role they created).<p>- I do not believe a company deserves your loyalty as much as one would think because they would just as quickly let you go regardless of years put in. In the end, both parties are involved in a business relationship and nothing more.<p>- Money is not the only driving force in life, but as a person that is just starting to build their career, you have to think about how much you will be losing out 10 years from now.

8780184,comment,8780014,8780014,0,0,christopherslee,,,"Not sure if this is your first 6 months in the working world or not. I&#x27;m guessing that it is. I&#x27;m not trying to discourage you from leaving, but I wanted to offer some perspective.<p>If your startup is indeed rapidly growing, I think it is invaluable to see the growth first hand. Only a fraction of startups really see true rapid growth.  Having that first hand experience will give you some perspective when hopefully, one day, your startup experiences that growth.  Additionally, when interviewing at the &quot;big hot startups&quot;, I think it&#x27;s a major plus to have seen that growth somewhere else.  But be honest with yourself if it&#x27;s real, rapid growth, and not just some vanity metrics.<p>Secondly, I share some concerns that if you&#x27;re burned out after your workday now, that quitting to do your own thing is going to be better. However, I can certainly empathize and understand that it is possible, but harder, to build a product part time at night.  To hedge your risk, you should find that idea that you&#x27;re really excited about, commit to getting an MVP and some traction to prove to yourself that you have an idea, and then quit.<p>While doing so, keep your responsibilities and cost of living structure low. Don&#x27;t sign a new bigger apartment while you&#x27;re getting a salary. Also, I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;ve thought about how long you can live without a salary. Do you need to supplement your ramen profitable startup with any extra income (contracting or otherwise?) If that&#x27;s necessary, you&#x27;ll need to spend time getting work and doing the work. I personally dislike contract/consulting work. I could never mental hack my way into feeling ownership of it.  I&#x27;ve learned I&#x27;d rather work at a product company and work on something on the side, than do a startup &quot;full time&quot; while part time consulting to cover bills.  Your preferences may be different.<p>Remember that startups are really hard. I&#x27;ve been through it to an acquihire, and I&#x27;ve had friends that were acquired for tens of million of dollars. And when I talk to them, I&#x27;m reminded that even though they&#x27;re doing well, it&#x27;s really hard.  I absolutely think it&#x27;s worth it if you&#x27;re willing to bet on yourself.<p>Feeling like you&#x27;ve hit a ceiling at work and that you&#x27;re only learning from yourself, sometimes can be fixed. Talk to your manager. Let them know. Maybe there&#x27;s more responsibility for you.  If you strike out on your own, guess who you&#x27;ll have to learn from. Just you again. While joining a large community of people working on their own startup is fun, it&#x27;s also lonely. No one cares about your startup more than you.",1419181857

(Who remembers Savings and Loan in the 80s?)<p>It would have been possible to restore confidence in other ways. Traditionally, good assets are collected into good banks, and bad assets are dumped into bad banks. The bad banks get thrown under a bus, and the good banks get full government backing until trust is restored.

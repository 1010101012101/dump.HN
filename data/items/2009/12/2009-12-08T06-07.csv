This page [1] is an excellent explanation, but it took a bit of hunting to run across it - at a very superficial first glance, it looks like I'm supposed to buy the music from you.

With a little care you can have thousands of requests per second, especially on top the JVM.<p>> <i>A single 45Kb SVG file, when fully parsed, eats up 150MB right here on my laptop.</i><p>That's not the fault of the JVM, although I do agree that many Java-libraries are memory-hogs.<p>The only difference between the JVM and CLR/Python/Perl/Ruby is that the JVM doesn't return the used memory to the OS. This means that if the JVM reaches 1 GB of used memory, it will remain there even if the GC kicks. Also, when allocating memory, the JVM has to allocate more memory than it needs because it needs space to degragment the heap. But on the other hand compared to CPython / Ruby MRI / Perl ... the JVM's GC is generational and heap-compacting, making it much more efficient memory-wise for long-running processes ... allocation is cheaper, deallocation is smarter and you won't end-up with a heap that looks like swiss cheese.",1260255193

Let me try to respond by line.<p>- Renting a book out once will yield the renter within 75% of what they'd get by selling back to the bookstore.  You should be able to rent it out 2-4 times which means it yields more than selling back to the bookstores.  This, of course, implies demand for your book.<p>- That's the big question.  We believe there's enough interest by students who want to save money and/or are sick of bookstores.<p>- Long enough for a venture.  Ultimately, this will go digital but that'll be a slow process.

SSDs have all this firmware and processing power to make them behave like hard drives. If we want to drive the underlying storage directly we might as well rip all that out and let the OS drive the flash directly from the main CPU. Why would we want to be sending programs into the black box? What can the firmware do that the main CPU couldn't if we stopped attaching flash as SATA and instead just created a direct connection that can DMA back and forth to main memory?<p>Some Linux developers have made that point, that they would rather be implementing their own filesystems directly on the flash than dealing with a firmware that is trying to make it appear that the SSD is a hard drive but that then needs TRIM to work around the fact that that is not true. These firmwares are nice for Intel by letting them turn a commodity (flash) into a differentiated (and higher margin) product based on the code in the firmware.

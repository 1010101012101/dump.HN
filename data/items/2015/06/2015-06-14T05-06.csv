That may work for technical programming skills but it doesn&#x27;t work for passion.&quot;<p>Regardless of what the technical abilities of the product, it&#x27;s a good reminder that a product made great by the hard work of people who believe in it should be mindful to prioritize their ambitions in product decisions.

9713881,comment,9713337,9713674,0,0,verbin217,,,"This has been my experience. To the extant that I&#x27;m trying to embed Javascript everywhere now. Many server-side operations are deterministic and only need to be executed on the server because it&#x27;s a trusted environment. They can be executed &quot;optimistically&quot; on the client if you have the same information and a compatible runtime. It makes everything feel snappier and enables a practical programming model. A single state transition function for each &quot;action&quot; performs the immediate client update and triggers validated server persistence in parallel. Without a ubiquitous execution environment that&#x27;s like four/five times as hard.",1434261540

Speech? I don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s free so it&#x27;s basically worthless&quot; that the intrinsic value of people who code is not that high.

9713872,comment,9711346,9713832,0,0,danbmil99,,,"When I download a piece of code under the BSD license, I <i>am</i> the user. I am free to do whatever I please with that code, including to modify it, and release the modifications under a different license (ie executable only, heavy DRM, whatever).<p>Anyone is still free to use the original release under the original license. They can modify it, improve it, and perhaps release those changes again under the BSD license.  No one has lost any freedoms at all under these scenarios.<p>What RMS and cohorts really want is not freedom the way it is usually understood. As he explains clearly, he wants a world without reliance on <i>any</i> proprietary, &quot;non-free&quot; (by his definition) software. By extension, the free software crowd is basically against the concept of intellectual property in its entirety.<p>What the GPL does is create a scenario where users are <i>restricted</i> from ever creating modified versions of the software licensed under terms of their choosing. The viral nature of the license forces users to continue enforcing those restrictions on all descendent versions of the software. The goal, quite clearly, is to foster a world of software that is fundamentally impossible to &quot;sell&quot; commercially in any shape or form. The new restrictions on patents and services in the AGPL3 make this agenda strikingly clear.<p>In the world I inhabit, permissive licensing frankly provides a way for a multiplicity of parties to communally build things of potential use to all members of the community. However, it does not restrict those members from branching off the communal tree for profit or any other reason. The collective work stands as a sort of &quot;commons&quot; that all farmers can allow their cattle to graze on. However it also allows for each farmer to maintain private grazing lands in addition to the commons.<p>Yes, in such a scenario some farmers could game the system by over-grazing -- in the analogy, that would mean taking lots of code and never giving back. Naively it would seem the GPL approach is better for disallowing this selfish behavior. But in the real world, the price for such draconian policing is the inability of anyone to create a reasonable business case for developing software -- no one can ever profit from the work they contributed. Richard Stallman may be fine with that scenario (I understand he was born wealthy), but it doesn&#x27;t work for anyone who has to sling code for a living.",1434261309

9713863,comment,9711236,9713236,0,0,jacobolus,,,"The CIE 1976 (u&#x27;, v&#x27;) UCS chromaticity diagram is a somewhat better chromaticity diagram than the standard 1931 (x, y) version for e.g. showing chromaticity of the primaries on a computer display: it reduces some of the dramatic perceptual distortions of xy. CIELUV is supposed to be a full 3D color space made out of a combination of a (very bad) chromatic adaptation method, the same lightness L* from CIELAB, and color coordinates L* u* v* which are simply derived from L*, u&#x27;, and v&#x27;.<p>In theory, CIELUV is a bit more directly relevant to colored lights or images on a television / computer display, whereas CIELAB is defined for surface colors. In practice, CIELUV just isn’t a very good uniform model of human color vision, and CIELAB is somewhat better (even for display colors) while still being quite easy to compute.<p>The reason color difference measures are defined with reference to CIELAB coordinates is that they are typically used for specifying tolerances on surface colors in industry. For instance, you might specify that a particular textile or paint color must be within a particular perceptual distance of a target color. CIELUV wouldn’t make any sense for such a use case.<p>Personally, I’d recommend people move on to use IPT or CIECAM02 or something similar instead.",1434261030

Here was part of my response:<p>As for the color space, I can understand the idea, but personally I think both HuSL and HuSLp are quite far from human friendly in practice, either for manual color selections or programming heuruistic color choices. In the case of HuSL, the numerical values for “saturation” are useless for comparisons across lightnesses or hues, and in the case of HuSLp, the very limited gamut of RGB displays in certain hues ends up leaving the majority of display colors outside of the HuSLp gamut, while still leaving the saturation numbers somewhat useless for comparisons across lightnesses.<p>I think end users would be better served by just using a cylindrical representation of CIELUV directly (or actually CIELAB, IPT, or CIECAM02 would be better still for most UI purposes I think, even in the context of computer displays, or perhaps NCS for certain use cases).

The above quote from the article clearly indicates this fact as, if we peform three simple keyword substitutions, the sentence reads thusly:<p>Prototypes in JavaScript are “just hash maps,” and since they are “just hash maps,” we can add, remove, or modify values of the prototype by adding, removing, or modifying the values bound to keys of the prototype.<p>Attempting to think of JavaScript objects in the same manner as what most mainstream &quot;OO&quot; languages semantically provide is simply wrong.  &quot;Prototypical inheiritance&quot; is nothing more than a shallow copy of an associative array.  By its very definition, that is _all it is_.<p>Now, IMHO there is nothing wrong with a hash map.  There&#x27;s nothing right about it either.  Those sentiments imply judgement, whereas what I have said above is simply analyzing the nature of the subject.  The fallacy in calling JavaScript &quot;objects&quot; objects lies in deceiving one&#x27;s self into thinking that the same semantic guarantees OO languages provide can be done in native JavaScript.  The quicker a developer accepts that JavaScript objects are simply hash maps, the quicker they can understand the semantic contract being proffered by the environment _and_ be able to work with it as best as possible.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp</a>",1434259514

That, and the long tail of libraries that may never get moved to Python3. There&#x27;s really a lot of reasons to not use 3, or like me, wait to see if it ever really overtakes 2.
A 3rd extra reason if you needed any more, is that almost all jobs in the field use 2.x. I tried to love Python3, but the technical reasons just don&#x27;t make sense to migrate, and once you meet the coercion and vitriol of the Python3 community, you&#x27;ll learn to resent its existence and them.<p>The future of Python2 is actually very bright, while 3&#x27;s is in jeopardy. That&#x27;s why everyone is so pushy about it, they lose their bet if it never gets over the hump. Being as 3.0 was released in 2008 and it&#x27;s now 2015, I honestly think that answer is already here.<p>Using 2, then switching to 3 if it ever does overtake it makes a lot of sense and is the sensible bet. But 3.x overtaking 2 anytime soon is really unlikely, and library worth anything will be 2+3 compatible and dropping 2 support would just be asinine with the ~83% userbase it holds today.<p>Even if Python3&#x27;s userbase <i>doubles</i> in 5 years, it&#x27;ll still be under 50% of the overall Python userbase. And I think doubling its current usage would be overly optimistic. Python3 will either collapse, or split the community (already has to a degree) with someone forking Python2 for good. Pyston may be that fork, or a couple other contenders.<p>The situation is a disaster all around. For Python and the community. Companies in some cases now aren&#x27;t putting new product down in Python because of this. 
You&#x27;ll be alright using 3, because no matter the final outcome you&#x27;ll be able to go back to 2 without issues and vice versa. I only recommend 2 because you won&#x27;t be missing <i>any</i> libraries if you use it, and if you want to do it for a job you&#x27;ll be using 2.x anyway.<p>Python3&#x27;s biggest purpose is giving people a reason to hassle maintainers to port to it. They bite on the political propaganda surrounding 3, that it&#x27;s the &quot;newest version&quot;, which for programming languages is not always in best interests of the user unlike an up-to-date web browser. Then when they find out x doesn&#x27;t work or exist in 3, they badger whoever wrote a library for 2 to port.
Those people really need to port it themselves and maintain it afterwards. They don&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s just an ugly situation.<p>For example, you can build iOS/Android apps using Kivy. Guess what, can&#x27;t build for iOS unless you use 2.7! Just lots of surprises out there for those who start off wanting the &quot;latest version&quot;. It&#x27;s not the latest version, it&#x27;s a new, breaking language. If you end up doing much cobbling with Python, this may be of interest to you.<p>I have my doubts 3 will get over the hump, and just plan on waiting till the complainers turn into maintainers and 99% of everything is ported. Then I&#x27;ll use Python3 if I don&#x27;t find something else I like more before then.",1434258331

I&#x27;m a security analyst and I&#x27;ve never met anyone in my industry that believes that security is a goal that can be achieved. Security is a process that will never end.<p>>I don&#x27;t think that this is a case where you want to trade off security for usability, and I don&#x27;t think that generally those cases exist. You always want more usability.<p>If you believe that security is always a tradeoff(which you stated) and you believe that there is never a situation where you would want to make such a tradeoff, you are basically saying that there is never a situation where you would want security, which is ridiculous. There is always a balance between usability and security. In most cases, the scales will tip towards usability by a large margin, but there are times where a significant hit to usability in the name of security is the right decision.",1434258222

It came out in 1979, and for a while, it looked like it was going to be the winning microprocessor. Intel didn&#x27;t have a 32-bit entry for years later.  But early attempts to build workstation machine ran into problems.  The 68000 had no matching MMU, and wouldn&#x27;t work properly with an MMU anyway - page fault state saving wasn&#x27;t quite right.  Machines with external MMUs were built anyway, but great kludging was needed to get around the design flaw. The Apple Lisa avoided using increment instructions, and Apollo had two CPUs; one for the user and one for the kernel, with only one running at a time.<p>That was fixed in the 68010, which came out in 1982.  But by then, IBM had picked the Intel 8088 for the IBM PC.  Motorola didn&#x27;t come out with the MC68451 MMU until a few years later, and it was a slow, segment-oriented MMU.  So the Macintosh didn&#x27;t have an MMU, and had a much weaker OS than the Lisa - no process isolation, no paging, not even a real CPU dispatcher.  The UNIX workstation crowd (Apollo, Sun, HP, etc.) all developed their own MMUs for the 680x0 line.<p>If Motorola hadn&#x27;t had those errors in the 68000 and had shipped an MMU earlier, the history of computing could have been quite different.",1434258194

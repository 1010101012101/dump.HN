I think we generally look at optimizing in two places: within the app market (soliciting ratings, reviews, keywords, titles, screenshots, and volume of downloads) and outside the app market. Since we have no clue how internals work, its probably better to spend time on external marketing.<p>Some basics that all devs should get down:<p>- a hit list of blogs that target your audience, pitch to them and get coverage<p>- submit to app review sites<p>- start building an email newsletter (integrate mailchimp into your app)<p>- if possible, cross promote through someone else's newsletter<p>- have a landing page + centralized FB page.

If someone took my thesis and turned it in and got an A, I would be psyched for them and happy they used my work. It doesn't hurt me at all.""<p>Not sure if this is devils advocate, but i'll answer.<p>If someone copies one paper, theres a legitimate argument that maybe it doesn't matter. But if copying in university was rife, people would just copy each others work and not learn anything, going through school for the monetary benefit only. Now lets say the subject is History, perhaps you don't care either way (short-sighted opinion, but the benefits are difficult to quantify). But now lets say this is medicine. All doctors cheat on their exams and research papers, so no-one knows anything, and even those who do bother to learn find it difficult to advance medical knowledge much further than the architects of all the original work.<p>So now does this attitude hurt you? Probably.<p>Games are far less important in life than professions like medicine. But Zynga must be one of the richest games companies around right now, and I'm not sure they actually know how to design their own games. Certainly i've never seen an original piece of work from them, everything is a rip off of smaller developers works, heavily marketed to eclipse the original creators. Who knows what this is doing to the facebook games market in the long term? (of course, the world might be a better place without so much facebook, but thats another story)",1328183463

Think of it this way: even if you went out and painted fences for people, you'd be breaking the law. You can't do anything for anyone, aside from volunteering.<p>I do not know the process for the company to get an H1-B quota, but the likelihood is that it will cost more than you think. If you can't afford the immigration lawyer, you can't afford to play these games with the US government. It's dangerous for both the company and yourself.<p>You're pretty screwed here (this is the H1-B working by design).

2619121,comment,2618270,2618898,2,0,DaveMebs,,,"I think it depends on the kind of business. I think it is useful to break Groupon deals into a few categories, as well as the number of customers involved in any given deal:<p>FAST-FOOD DINING\nDepending on the number of customers. most, if not all, fast-food restaurants  will probably be able to make a profit of a 50% deal. These businesses thrive on large numbers of customers, and their profits scale extremely well. It is also relatively easy to win over new customers if you are more convenient, providing a reasonable opportunity to gain repeat customers (ex: Dominos does a deal and people find it delicious and cheap).<p>SIT-DOWN DINING\nThis is a much harder category to map a profit on a Groupon deal. These restaurants have a much more rigid number of customers they can serve on any given night. For a popular restaurant there is to use Groupon as they can already fill the seats and it is not a good value for them. For unpopular restaurants, people will attend but it seems unlikely these will be repeat customers. They are already bargain hunters, and it will be hard to wow these customers enough to return to your restaurant repeatedly.<p>ONE TIME USE ACTIVITIES\nThese deals have a similar problem to the sit-down restaurant. These are fun the first time, but repeat visits are much less compelling and it will be challenging to permanently pique the interest of bargain hunters. (ex: Deal on a boat tour)<p>REPEAT USE ACTIVITIES\nRepeat activities seem like a reasonable set market for Groupon. These activities suffer from the same fixed-sized problem, however they stand a reasonable chance of retaining customers. Deals such as training and introductory courses are explicitly designed to attract new customers, and a Groupon top get them in the door seems fairly reasonable.<p>No matter what activity the Groupon is for, the number of customers who take advantage of the deal is a key component. Economy of scale is true for every business, and the more customers who take advantage of any given deal will directly affect the profit in involved with any given transaction",1307174030

It allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. If a foreign worker in H-1B status quits or is dismissed from the sponsoring employer, the worker must either apply for and be granted a change of status to another non-immigrant status, find another employer (subject to application for adjustment of status and/or change of visa), or leave the United States.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa</a><p>Many people get this mixed up.

My advice is to find a professional that can safely help you pursue happiness.  Just out of curiosity and a potential starting point, when was the last time you were happy?  Also, boarding school sounds like a significant and possibly traumatic incident in your life (did you have mixed feelings about going to boarding school?).  I'll also throw out there that your sexual fantasies, so long as they don't hurt another person and you have a willing participant aren't bad...after all, to each their own.  Remember, sex should be gratifying.  If you feel nothing or worse when you are done, or shortly thereafter, and are escalating the behaviors to ""feel something"", you should probably stop the acts and tell a professional.<p>With regard to your situation as a founder of a startup with employees and investors, if you can't do the job or fear you can fly off the handle at any time, you need to be an adult and do the right thing (which could be at a great personal cost).  That could mean selling your piece, bringing in someone else, going on leave, whatever.  But, you have taken several steps to reach out on your own behalf and you should at least make the same attempts to safeguard the money / livelihood of those who have helped you get where you are today.  That doesn't mean you have to tell them what's going on, but you still have to take action.<p>My advice to you is figure out what makes you happy.  It's way harder than it sounds, so start small.  Do you have a hobby that brings you joy?  Something from your childhood you haven't done in a long time, but made you happy back then?  Have you ever tried helping a complete stranger?  Start doing 1 thing a day until you find something that makes you feel better and run with that (make sure whatever you try is positive).<p>I hope we see a post from you in the future that tells us how much better you are doing.

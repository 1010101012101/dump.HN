See Michele Titolo&#x27;s open radar here <a href=""http://openradar.appspot.com/14221477"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openradar.appspot.com/14221477</a><p>Jenkins is going to have alot more functionality, especially with 3rd party integrations and doing arbitrary work. Jenkins is also an ugly mess than can be painful to setup, especially since most iOS/Mac developers build from Xcode and not the command line. OS X Server gets some ease of use out of only doing running standard Tests, static analysis, and building your project for distribution (they bragged about 1-click downloads from their Bots website to people in your company, but I haven&#x27;t tried that). Bots integrates with Xcode to give you a nice rundown of how tests ran on multiple devices and OSes.",1382677197

6609843,comment,6609682,6609682,4,0,danso,,,"My first reaction to this news was: &quot;there is one screenwriter who was involved in writing Raiders of the Lost Ark, Empire Strikes Back, <i>and</i> Return of the Jedi?&quot;...and he&#x27;s still alive? what the hell has he been doing all this time and how badly did he piss off George Lucas to not be involved in the most recent Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies? Both Raiders and ESB have such wild adventure and such respect for the audience&#x27;s intelligence that watching them today is still a revelation, even after seeing them dozens of times. I recently watched Avengers for the first time and was shocked at just how such a dull movie could make so much money...are our standards just lower? Are special effects too relied on to gloss over poor imagination? Or am I just getting really old, even though the original Star Wars  movies were before my time? I felt the same way during Avatar...I couldn&#x27;t believe that the same guy who wrote the sparse but brilliantly quotable dialogue of &quot;Aliens&quot; was behind Avatar&#x27;s groanworthy one liners.<p>I hope Kasdan brings back the magic and that the reason why we don&#x27;t see movies like ESB and Raiders anymore is because their screenwriter simply stopped writing them.",1382676988

A retailer had me pay the varies fees, fixed and variable, both bean and machine, to make a profit.<p>About the only conflict that exists to producing a cheap cup of coffee (or, for my for urbane friends, &#x27;latte&#x27;) is the rent.  Here, you are competing with the various retail options that a landlord could also sell in that location.

This probably pins and destroys a lot of the brain tissue in its path, but the people who use it claim it gives them &quot;better spatial resolution&quot; in the mapping recordings.

I met him years ago, before Uber was even a twinkle in his eye, and he was running his last company, Red Swoosh.<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;insider&quot; here. I graduated high school, turned 18, and moved to the Valley in 1999. I stayed there for the next 10 years. My parents are not technical and I&#x27;m from a small town in Indiana.<p>I did not get a college degree and I did not go to a prestigious university. I knew no one when I moved there. Eventually, years later, as the startup community coalesced and we all recovered from the pit of despair that was 2001-2002 in the Valley, people started having parties.<p>I went to socialize. I met many of the &quot;heavy hitters&quot; you see today. And I built a successful tech company with many of them as customers.<p>Yeah, the articles love to talk about Stanford grads and whatnot. Maybe they had it easier than me. I don&#x27;t know. What I do know is I came out there with nothing but guts and a car (that literally exploded on me a year later) and...most importantly...no belief that I <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> succeed or that I wouldn&#x27;t make it.<p>It does take guts to pack your shit and sleep on the floor for a while, but eventually it does pay off. I&#x27;m running my second successful tech company now, this time in Austin, where again I know most of the folks in the startup community. Not because I&#x27;m some sort of &quot;insider&quot;, but just because I went out there and met everyone, and I asked them for advice.<p>There&#x27;s nothing stopping you, or anyone else reading this, from doing the same. Can&#x27;t afford a ticket to the Valley, or don&#x27;t want to deal with immigration laws? Find a booming startup metropolis somewhere else and get to know the people there. Startups are global now and it&#x27;s a beautiful thing. But don&#x27;t buy into the negative media hype.",1382675869

6609690,comment,6609493,6609493,1,0,11thEarlOfMar,,,"Let&#x27;s first differentiate robotics versus automation. A conveyor belt is a form of automation. So are the &#x27;robots&#x27; that pick up auto parts and place them into position so other &#x27;robots&#x27; can weld them. These devices are specifically designed to perform repetitive movements, handling a payload or stamping a label, or folding a box. They operate with a defined set of repeating actions. They constitute automation, not robotics.<p>Robots are devices that respond to input from unstructured events in an open environment. They must have some amount of interpretive logic that takes input from a variety of sensors and chooses a response. The state of the input may not have a matching defined response in the robot&#x27;s control software, but the robot needs to make a guess or perhaps learn with repeated trials over time.<p>Automation in manufacturing has been with us for a century or so and its effects have made more and more sophisticated material possessions available to larger and larger markets. More part content, more sophisticated parts, lower and lower cost, more features and therefore, more value to the buyer. Or, in another vein, more food available to more people, better sorted, safer, more consistent quality and attributes. Automation does reduce the human labor content in the goods we purchase, but at the same time, it reduces the cost of those goods so that more units are sold and more people can afford them. Less human labor per item, but many more items.<p>Robots and robotics are still decades away from actually supplanting humans as free-roaming servants that could make workers obsolete. True AI is still very expensive to produce. The variability of an open environment and the myriad events that can occur make the response options too numerous for software to efficiently handle. Researchers remain encouraged, but they have been so for 50 years. Our brains still outperform AI by a wide margin and that margin has to be substantially reduced before any of us are replaced.<p>Automation does displace work. But it also makes more sophisticated goods available to more people. So the conversation should be about how to manage the job displacement and transition workers from one vocation to another within a nation or region. Select a broad enough region and you&#x27;ll find the jobs created roughly equate to the jobs lost. Manufacturing jobs in the rust belt become customer service centers in the plains States or software development jobs in The Valley. The net of the two is the unemployment rate.<p>My theory, entirely borne of intuition, is that in a capitalist economy, innovation resolves unemployment.",1382673879

3341718,comment,3341308,3341633,7,0,tikhonj,,,"The reason so many experienced people suggest learning the basics of Vim (or, in my case, Emacs) in one go is because it  works quickly and efficiently--certainly more quickly and more efficiently than an incremental approach. Additionally, just giving up on arrow keys and the like does not necessarily entail a ""huge volume"" of memorization.<p>I am an inherently lazy person; I cannot just sit down and memorize stuff (one of the reasons I'm in CS). Yet I definitely support giving up the mouse and arrow keys immediately.<p>When I originally picked up Emacs, I went through the tutorial and promptly forgot exactly which keys did what. However, I decided to follow the tutorial's advice and learn how to navigate properly. To do this, all I did was not use the mouse or arrow keys for editing some text. For the first couple of days, I had to keep looking the keys up each time I did anything; later--relatively abruptly--I started using them without realizing. There is no way I would have learned nearly as much as quickly if I had not got through a couple days of not knowing what I was doing.<p>Once the standard moving commands became second nature, I started using some of the more specialized ones (like moving around by line or paragraph or expression). Without having given up on the arrow keys and mouse, I would probably never have learned the more advanced movements which are now <i>exceptionally</i> useful.<p>Basically, to follow your suggestion would be to avoid a couple days of bumbling around in favor of being less effective for a very long time. On the other hand, with my approach, I <i>did</i> spend a couple days being incompetent but then the bindings became natural. Ultimately, to me, being lazy involves not just minimizing work immediately, but increasing efficiency in the long run as well.<p>As a contrast, I know many classmates who have tried to learn Emacs your way. Most of them can use it, but not much more efficiently than notepad; I regularly see them spending minutes doing menial tasks that would have taken seconds had they known Emacs better. In the context of a 90 minute lab, that is not trivial at all; even in the context of working full time, the amount of time they can save should not be ignored.<p>Ultimately, all it takes to learn Emacs (and, I imagine, the same can be said of Vim) is a little bit of patience and willingness to embrace change. By jumping into the deep end immediately, you can learn <i>really</i> quickly, and reap the benefits almost immediately.",1323651418

3341660,comment,3341478,3341614,2,0,jamesaguilar,,,"And what better way to start that discussion than sharing with us your feelings about how benighted it will be?<p>On the topic of the article itself, what I was most curious about was how rich people act in Greece (i.e. where are these mountain fastnesses in which they supposedly live)? In practical matters, what would it mean for the rich to ""drop out"" of American society? It's hard to think of one that is more friendly to them than this. Is the author mostly proposing that they cease to ""live"" rich until the anti-wealthy sentiment dies down? I know the piece is a jest, but I'm wondering about the specifics of the joke.<p>Another thing I wonder about is how one would stand out as a 1%er in ordinary life. I know that there are at least a few 1%ers in my circle of friends, although no one that you would think of as fabulously wealthy -- no one buying yachts or owning three or four houses. But I also know that there are a good many people who make less than me and live more richly than I do. It's almost impossible to identify a wealthy person in modern society. The best you can do is identify people who _expend_ large amounts of wealth. This makes me pretty confident that we'll not soon see any victims of French Revolution style violence in this country. All you have to do to maintain your wealth while appearing normal is move out of your mansion and sell your fancy car. Unless you are famous. This was not as easy a few centuries ago when wealth was almost the same as land and you needed to keep working it to keep producing more.",1323650342

However, if you <i>want</i> side-effects, you're forced to write your code in a <i>different</i> style.<p>As a (really bad) example, you have an Enemy ""class"" which must know about enemies adjacent to itself at creation time.<p>Without side-effects (using `new`):<p><pre><code>    var enemy = new Enemy(enemyList);
    enemyList.push(enemy);

    // Now enemy is inside of enemyList,
    // but it's not enforced.  I find this
    // method prone to mistakes.

</code></pre>
With side-effects (using `new`):<p><pre><code>    var enemy = new Enemy(enemyList);

    // Now enemy is inside of enemyList;
    // I wouldn't expect that postcondition!
</code></pre>
And without constructors, but with side-effects:<p><pre><code>    var enemy = enemyList.createEnemy();
    // or
    var enemy = createEnemy(enemyList);

    // Now enemy is inside of emptyList
</code></pre>
The problem here is that an enemy <i>must</i> be part of a list.  The classical OO solution is to use constructor parameters.  Ideally, I'd just have a function to deal with creation and adding it to the list (like `createEnemy`).<p>In ES5, `enemyList.createEnemy` could be written like this:<p><pre><code>    var enemy = Object.create(Enemy.prototype, {
        enemyList: { value: this } // Ugh!
    });
    this.push(enemy);
    Enemy.call(enemy); // Necessary evil if you use standard JS ""classes""
    return enemy;
</code></pre>
I'd much prefer something like:<p><pre><code>    var enemy = enemyProto { enemyList: this }; // Basically binds the object literal with the enemyProto prototype, returning the modified object.
    this.push(enemy);
    // enemy ctor logic here; e.g. Enemy.call(enemy) as above
    return enemy;</code></pre>",1323648809

3341575,comment,3340143,3341538,1,0,Mz,,,"It's a complex topic, which I suspect cannot be done justice in a post on HN.<p>I am currently being evicted.  My mother has informed me that due to my father's medical situation, I am not welcome to come home again.  My two adult, unemployed special needs sons still live with me.  I am deeply in debt and in very serious trouble.  In some sense, I suppose I probably look like ""the poster child"" for all the financial issues your ""typical"" divorced homemaker can have.  But it's really not that simple.<p>I have a deadly genetic disorder.  So does my oldest son.  I not only raised my sons, I also homeschooled them for many years.  They both have a long list of special needs but are also incredibly intelligent.  I nearly died about 11 years ago and this led to being diagnosed late in life with ""atpical cystic fibrosis"".  All of this ultimately led to me getting divorced, in part so I would be in a position to save my life and get well.  My sons were on the same page with me.  My husband was on the same page with the doctors, who were all too happy to wash their hands of trying to get me well and just blame my genes.<p>I could not have gotten well without the ongoing dedicated care of my two sons, who were 11 and 13 when this journey began.  I had their backing when most of the world was actively trying to talk me out of my crazy scheme to actually take care of myself.  Getting well has destroyed me financially but had I not gotten well, I would likely be in worse straits by far, both financially and in overall quality of life.  I have gotten off boatloads of drugs and the hole in my left lung has closed.  I have been well enough to work a full-time paid job the past five years, which I really was never well enough to do before. The condition I and my son have is one of the more expensive, chronic medical conditions around.  And though I have gotten myself basically health, there is no cure.  For me, it will be a case of ""management"" for the rest of my life, but the answers I have come up with are vastly superior to anything else out there, both in terms of quality of life and in terms of financial impact.  This miracle could not have been pulled out without the backing of my sons.<p>I wish there were easy answers with regards to the whole gender equality thing.  I think of such things as a matter of ""sexual morality"" in that as long as heterosexual people have sex, children will result.  Human need is a complex thing and cannot be boiled down to any one thing, not money, not length of life, not career success.  Given the details of my situation, in spite of my current dire financial situation, I think I got the better deal in keeping the kids.  If I get through this, a career can come later.  But first I had to live.  I've done that.<p>Perhaps it's time to go play a game.  Examining my navel in public is an old habit that I like indulging but it often comes across as shocking, disturbing and problematic for other people.<p>Peace and have a great evening.",1323648217

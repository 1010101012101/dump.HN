11068295,comment,11057373,11068206,0,0,showerst,,,"Here in DC (One of the most expensive US metro areas), it&#x27;s super common to rent a room in a &#x27;group house&#x27; in your 20s with 2-5 other young professionals or students. I&#x27;d say the majority of my 25-35 year old friend group started that way, and the single ones still do.<p>That&#x27;s partially a quirk of fast gentrification making housing super expensive, combined with lots of housing stock that fits well (row houses), and the fact that not many young people own cars, so parking isn&#x27;t a problem.<p>Given the choice I&#x27;m sure virtually all of them would prefer a 1br apartment, but that starts at $1800+/mo in the desirable parts of the city.<p>Previously I lived in St. Louis, which is a much more spread out, cheap suburban city, and most of my friends had apartments.<p>If I had to guess I&#x27;d say the &#x27;group house&#x27; model (whatever the local nickname) is predominant in New York, SF, DC, Seattle, and a few other expensive, dense cities, and rarer in the more suburban cities of the midwest/south. In NYC people often share small apartments since even a row house is out of reach.",1455047985

Or is everybody just happy with Google Drive & DropBox these days?<p>2) For now this is totally free, if it takes off I&#x27;ll look at figuring out how to cover costs later. Is that a non starter?<p>3) I&#x27;ll add an SSL soon, I&#x27;d usually use CloudFlare but they have a stupid 100MB upload limit. Once I get an SSL the uploads will be much more anonymous and secure.<p>4) No logging of any kind. I don&#x27;t log who uploads what, server logs are auto cleared and all uploads are deleted after 30 days.<p>5) 100GB upload limit. (currently) If I can figure out how to increase the load balancer timeout to more than 60mins I would like to remove all upload limits entirely.<p>I can&#x27;t be the first person to attempt a side project like this, so I&#x27;m assuming there&#x27;s some glaringly obvious pitfall I&#x27;m overlooking, but for now, it&#x27;s a fun ride.<p>Thoughts please.",1455047952

People whose primary job is to make sure that data gets from the database to HTML and back really don&#x27;t need to know what is under the covers. This position is called &quot;product programmer&quot;. Their job is to translate whatever your UX guy cooked up into things that actually work. If you then need to make sure that whatever they made scales up to thousands of requests, you need to have a different person called a &quot;performance developer&quot; - these people really hate translating UX wireframes into code, but once that part is done, they can optimize everything up and down the stack with their eyes closed.<p>Also, this is a personal pet peeve of mine: if you are asking what a singleton is in a job interview, you are interviewing for the wrong thing, so no wonder you are getting the wrong interviewees.",1455047588

It&#x27;s extremely popular for students, and some of the leases remain after the students graduate and it effectively becomes a young-professional&#x27;s home, and rooms get filled up when someone leaves, usually via FB connections. But actually applying to live with strangers say as a 29 year old is rare... either you have your own place, or one with a partner.<p>The reason I ask is because, theoretically and often in practice, shared living is more space-efficient. The living room is shared, the kitchen, the bathroom, the washer, all the little things, and then you attach 4 bedrooms to it, and you can get a footprint that&#x27;s smaller than 4 studios with a similarly sized kitchen/bathroom etc. But it only works if, culturally, people can stomach living together with other people they&#x27;re not family or intimate friends with. While undoubtedly many people want their own place, in a time (and city) of scarcity of space, I wonder if part of the solution should not simply come from shared living, rather than more space efficient solo-living.

If you haven&#x27;t seen it before, the answer is often quite surprising: a human can walk under the circle even though the 710 inches of extra length are shared over the whole earth&#x27;s circumference. Basic human intuition produces the most common answers, which are the bacteria or the ladybug. This helps to illustrate the purpose of math: to help us reason to determine the truth when basic intuition fails. If basic intuition were always right, then we wouldn&#x27;t need math!<p>If you had seen the puzzle before though, you would already know that the rope lifts high, because it lifts by 710/(2*pi) inches, which is 113.0000095... taking us to the second layer of math embedded deeper in the problem. That is remarkably close to a whole number, which is surprising because pi is an irrational number. This means that pi is very close to 355/113, which brings us to the topic of Continued Fraction representations of irrational numbers, and amazing rational approximations of pi: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC</a><p>So, this problem hits at both basic and advanced levels. :)<p>There are many interesting ways to teach math through multi-layered puzzles which have something for everyone, no matter where you are in the experience spectrum.

11068127,comment,11067604,11067604,0,0,goodside,,,"&quot;Astronomers have concluded that the universe began some 12 to 15 billion years ago. That means we can only see the part of it that lies within 12 to 15 billion light-years from us.&quot;<p>This is false, because it ignores the metric expansion of spacetime. We can see radiation from objects that are now ~46.5 billion light-years from Earth.<p>This isn&#x27;t picking nits. The explanation given here makes it sound like the Universe is a Euclidean volume that got instantaneously filled with stars, at roughly their present density, and that this density is low enough that light from distant stars hasn&#x27;t reached us yet. If this were true, it wouldn&#x27;t only explain why the sky is dark now, but predict that it has always been dark. We know this is false: for the first 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the Universe was filled with hydrogen plasma and completely opaque to radiation, which we can still see in the form of CMBR. As spacetime expands, energy density decreases, space becomes less light-emitting and more transparent, and light already in transit becomes red-shifted. Our field of vision is still technically flooded with light, as it always has been, but by now the red-shift is so extreme that the light is in the radio spectrum.",1455046821

The answer is a congestion fee like Bloomberg wanted to put in. Also eliminating most city employee parking permits and upping the cost of on-street parking to prevent circling.<p>As for the subway, it depends on the line. The Lexington Avenue line is the most overcrowded. More trains can&#x27;t be added at this point -- at least not without CBTC (which they should really prioritize more!) The second avenue subway should help there, but that&#x27;s not exactly around the corner either. After the Lexington Line the next most congested is the L, which is only relevant to a small part of Manhattan (but has big implications for growth in northern Brooklyn) and the E/F coming in from Queens until it hits midtown.

There&#x27;s a few people doing stuff in public if you want to play with it. Plus lists to stuff to try. Here&#x27;s a few.<p>One person did an overview of Cleanroom and examples in Python, etc here:<p><a href=""http://infohost.nmt.edu/~shipman/soft/clean/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infohost.nmt.edu/~shipman/soft/clean/</a><p>I just pulled a list of techniques that were empirically proven to increase robustness into a Pastebin:<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/xZ6m4T8Z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/xZ6m4T8Z</a><p>Note: One can pick and choose among these to find right work/benefit ratio. I&#x27;d like to see lots of experiments on mainstream software to get data on what&#x27;s 80/20 rule. I&#x27;m betting on sane subsets of safe languages, code reviews, usage-driven testing, interface checks (even asserts), and fuzz testing maybe. The first four are widely available and take little work.<p>Case study of Altran&#x27;s Correct-by-Construction approach showing great metrics:<p><a href=""https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/iccc/7iccc/t1/t1201100.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/iccc/7iccc/t1/t1201100....</a><p>Note: Altran does plenty of medium and high assurance work. Their method can do either. I&#x27;d rate Tokeener as Medium-High if just focusing on their part of it. Note that they got it done with 3 part-timers in less than a year with code-level proofs. Quite a leap from millions spent on teams of geniuses doing proofs in Gypsy, etc two years at a time back in the day. :)<p>&quot;Regarding the quote, I don&#x27;t think you quite took the spirit of it: the idea is that, given a replaceable component with failure expected, we can manage reasonably to achieve the same outcomes for less overall cost &quot;<p>I&#x27;m not questioning the spirit so much as the implementation.<p>&quot; do not build the one true system to solve all availability and security challenges (which would be very expensive (the old &quot;pick two&quot; adage)), but rather build a system which makes use of the properties of components intelligently to reduce overall hassle&quot;<p>That&#x27;s what I advocated. With medium assurance, it cost almost nothing extra so apply it to the components. With high assurance, if used at all, it can be used on just the most important and is by some niche players with good cost/benefit results. It&#x27;s just that...<p>&quot;to achieve the same objectives, just as reliably/securely.&quot;<p>...this has rarely proven to work. There&#x27;s an old rule that you can&#x27;t make high robustness systems by composing low-robustness components. They experience both individual and byzantine failures. That&#x27;s why we see the companies building on them experiencing downtime that shouldn&#x27;t happen on top of unavoidable downtime which I don&#x27;t judge. So, certainly break the problem into smaller ones and compose simple (or cheap) solutions where possible. You just have a baseline of quality you need for the components. Commonly expressed as &quot;weakest link&quot; or &quot;Garbage In, Garbage Out.&quot;<p>&quot;I think the main reason there are less modern systems running for 15+ year timeframes is that the centralized models of yore only remain valid within traditional large organizations that are slow moving: finance, government infrastructure, military, etc.&quot;<p>Someone else speculated the same thing. There&#x27;s some truth to it. Yet, there&#x27;s overlap between the kinds of services running on them and in the modern, downtime-prone infrastructures. The stuff works on robust systems of old times but fails on new ones. What&#x27;s the key difference? One was designed to be robust and one is a composition of pieces of known to unknown quality. Garbage in, garbage out.<p>&quot;as COTS hardware + FOSS topple traditional mainframe vendors through cheap and highly scalable clustering.&quot;<p>They&#x27;re definitely cheaper and faster. That&#x27;s been the case since Beowulf clusters I built back in the day. Yet, their uptimes still haven&#x27;t reached what OpenVMS hit in the 80&#x27;s with bullet-proof clustering. Are you truly saying hardware and admin labor is so free right now that we can just throw dozens to hundreds of servers in 3-5 locations at every businesses&#x27; problems while ignoring the architectural, interface or code quality of any of it? I&#x27;ll take QNX 2 here and 2 there over a bunch of Linux boxes any day so long as budget will allow the license. I&#x27;ll have predictability, performance, self-healing, damage containment, and live updates all in a few megs of well-written code w/ POSIX apps.<p>See the difference between that and mainstream systems? Good architecture still matters. System/38 (AS/400), OpenVMS, NonStop, QNX, BeOS... all great architecture that squeezed way more out of any given piece of hardware, software, or admin effort. OpenVMS was also an example of medium assurance that was point of our discussion. Their Red/Blue iterations did 1 week development & test writing then 1 straight week of review and fixes with regression tests over weekends. Results were boxes so reliable admins sometimes forgot how to reboot it and such. Still not common on Windows and Linux boxes despite the great strides in reliability that nearly a <i>billion dollars</i> worth of labor bought those bad architectures. I like to poke at Linux folks that MINIX 3 eliminated most crashes in a few years with a small team while UNIX architecture took <i>decades</i> to <i>mostly</i> do the same thing. Architecture & assurance activities matter.<p>&quot;though they are definitely capable, and with Linux it has been done&quot;<p>I&#x27;d like to see evidence of that. The mainframes, AS/400&#x27;s, VMS, NonStop&#x27;s... these run all sorts of workloads without software repairs for years. Heavy workloads. I&#x27;ve investigated numerous claims of individual Linux boxes doing the same. It was almost always someone&#x27;s barely-utilized, hobbyist web server, DHCP server, etc. I want to see the equivalent of a mainframe or VMS server running everything in a business 24/7 without a crash in years. Optionally that system getting lost due to never needing maintenance with people scouring the building looking for it. That was a recurring problem with pizza box servers and embedded cards running aforementioned OS&#x27;s. ;)<p>&quot;they do run in harsh environments with limited resources in hundreds of millions - nay - billions of instances, extremely reliably.&quot;<p>Again, a source for this. They certainly run regular workloads they&#x27;re optimized for quite reliably. The cloud vendors optimizing on specific HW configurations with all kinds of disaster tolerance appear to run them reliably by hiding the failures. Yet, surveys of industry on their servers&#x27; downtime contradicts the overall claim with all kinds of downtime still in mainstream stuff. Plus, they show recent Windows servers ahead of Linux in reliability and AIX usually stayed on top. They don&#x27;t include the stuff I mentioned due to maybe market share or perhaps the contrast would make the others look bad. ;)<p>Nonetheless, adopting medium assurance methods to build our components or using components built that way is a solution. It was proven... is used... in many commercial systems that have higher quality at acceptable price and performance. Outside one-offs, the only reason it&#x27;s not happening is lack of knowledge or will to do it. Mainstream devs were told about the stuff for years so they just don&#x27;t give a shit. Surprisingly, Microsoft is ahead in efforts as they implemented SDL, formal methods on drivers, integrity controls, app protections, safe language use, and so on. I would <i>love</i> to see that level of commitment on BSD and Linux side given I use both. Least they sometimes accept fixes from academics who apply various tools in their spare time or with grant funding. ;)",1455046714

I think it&#x27;s valuable to communicate that actually math is the art of creative thinking. To do this, it helps to share some &quot;gems&quot;, or examples with powerful &quot;Aha&quot; factors.<p>Along these lines, I have a very fresh one: last week, I just had a very shocking (mathematical) realization while thinking about football:<p>There is a way to instantly see the optimal running angle when evading an equal-speed defender in football: eyeball the line which runs through the midpoint between you and the defender, and see where it hits the edge of the field - run straight there.<p>I was immediately floored by this observation, because it is so easy in retrospect that it should be common knowledge. Yet literally everybody I&#x27;ve told this to has said that it was new to them - mathematicians & people from the general public. I quickly threw together a video to share it across the community:<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/9sxVgJ_wPaM?list=PLqv4sKOD1bsUoSs-SbzlA2BE1tML4A33u"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/9sxVgJ_wPaM?list=PLqv4sKOD1bsUoSs-SbzlA2BE1...</a><p>I think that by thinking of and packaging cool nuggets of &quot;math&quot; like this to share, we can help rebrand the image of math. :)",1455046644

One reason is similar to why we have an adversarial system in law - if most people support an idea, such as free speech, in principle, but nobody is really dedicated to defending it and the easiest way to accomplish other goals is to compromise it, the slippery slope can easily become steep without people really noticing. Another is just that it&#x27;s easy for these issues to be overpoliticized, especially when you have a physical presence in Silicon Valley.<p>You hit the nail on the head with this.<p>> But all that said, there must be rules.

There are plenty of people who are better qualified than me to discuss the overall strategy and financial picture, so I won&#x27;t even try.<p>I can, however, give a few opinions about my 2+ years in GBS.<p>* There is a general lack of respect for technical skills. I was hired as a &quot;Technical Consultant&quot; but put through the same training as the business consultant grads, which is largely about project management / presentation skills. A lot of money is spent on this training, if you ask for funding to (e.g.) attend a developer conference, you are told to forget about it. Maintaining dev skills or learning new ones is to be done in your own time or as part of &quot;giveback&quot;, which is the IBM name for extra work done on top of your day job.<p>* The leadership team is utterly obsessed with maximising billable hours. While this is understandable for a services business, it is taken to ridiculous extremes. People are under such pressure to be billable that they are forced into roles that are completely unsuitable for them, rather than spend a few days waiting for the right role. Training etc gets cancelled at short notice if billable targets are not met, especially in Q4. Last year the entire GBS UK workforce were banned from taking any vacation for several weeks in November and December. A spoof email from senior management was circulated, saying &quot;Christmas is cancelled&quot; which gives an idea of current morale.<p>* The annual appraisal (PBC) system is a popularity contest. The best way to game the system is to do &quot;giveback&quot; (see above) work for senior people and persuade them to write nice things about you. This is all well and good, but it means that performance in your main job role is actually secondary to how much eminence you can gain by doing odd jobs for senior management. Thankfully IBM has seen the light and retired the PBC process, so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how well the replacement works.<p>* I get the feeling that nobody really understands Watson. It seems like the senior execs are under a lot of pressure to buy into the hype and sell Watson to their clients. There is a lot of hand waving about using Watson in &quot;virtual assistant&quot; type of use cases, but I&#x27;ve seen very little of any substance.<p>* The bureaucracy can be incredibly painful. I once had to go through multiple layers of sign-off involving people in 2 different countries over several weeks, to buy a $25 software licence (which I needed urgently for my job).<p>* Things are changing, slowly. The iX service line is adopting a startup-like approach on some projects.

11067907,comment,11066382,11067735,0,0,comex,,,"> My point is that regardless of where someone sits on the political spectrum (even if I agree with them), they shouldn&#x27;t have input on what should be an open platform for free speech.<p>In other words, you&#x27;re saying <i>no one</i> should have input on it?  There should be no rules at all?<p>Twitter is fairly unusual even among social networks, and different from most &quot;normal&quot; websites, in that it makes it relatively easy for random strangers to contact semi-famous people.  Most of the time this is a great thing.  But if you&#x27;re annoyed by speech on, say, stormfront dot org, you can avoid it by not going there.  If people are saying horrible things to you on Twitter, you can avoid it by blocking them - which works up until the point you become infamous enough among a specific subcommunity that a constant stream of random people show up in your mentions, most of them relatively innocuous (but annoying), some of them nastier than that.  (And it&#x27;s not like only misguided people have large numbers of haters - regardless of what you believe about Sarkeesian in particular, a look at mainstream politics is enough to refute that.)<p>Personally, I would prefer a decentralized social network where different subcommunities could use software to define their own interaction policies, much like the Internet as a whole.  But Twitter is a centralized service; most users use the official apps (as is required to get the full feature list) and must rely on Twitter&#x27;s centralized management to filter out both spam and abuse.  There&#x27;s no way around it short of a radical overhaul of the service.<p>I would support adding civil libertarian organizations to the mix of advisors, as a sibling comment mentions, for a variety of reasons.  One reason is similar to why we have an adversarial system in law - if most people support an idea, such as free speech, in principle, but nobody is really dedicated to defending it and the easiest way to accomplish other goals is to compromise it, the slippery slope can easily become steep without people really noticing.  Another is just that it&#x27;s easy for these issues to be overpoliticized, especially when you have a physical presence in Silicon Valley.<p>But all that said, there must be rules.  If you don&#x27;t like that, go somewhere else.  Who knows, maybe GNU Social will take off.",1455045548

If the people you want buying things in 15 years don&#x27;t pay attention to ads what happens to the industry?<p>And in the meantime if it&#x27;s Facebook, Google, Verizon, Snapchat or nothing, what happens to all the other apps and webpages currently only surviving on meager Ad Revenue if advertisers abandon them wholesale? Can something like Reddit even exist when it makes very little money on it&#x27;s own and can&#x27;t subsidize with Ad revenue?",1455044618

Having to custom-build to do interesting things is very far away from the &quot;plug and play&quot; experience that our users expect and can get with Apache.<p>While I&#x27;m not on the bandwagon that says all Apache installations would be better on nginx (and I still run Apache on all of our servers, except nginx test machines), I do think this makes the case quite a bit more compelling, particularly for people who package and distribute the web server (OS vendors, control panel maintainers like me, container builders, etc.).",1455044606

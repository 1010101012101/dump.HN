10317913,comment,10317701,10317845,0,0,VLM,,,"Its the psychological problem.  Quitting smoking, for example, would be pretty easy without the addiction aspect.  Likewise, considering low carb for example, losing weight is really easy when your appetite almost entirely disappears and a world full of candy bags and giant size corn syrup sodas has no similar instant gratification for low carb&#x27;ers.  People who are used to neopuritan joys of dieting such as agonizing craving don&#x27;t understand that the main point of low carb is not feeling hungry leads to imploded &#x27;energy in&#x27; as you state etc.<p>Also when I fall off the wagon for a day and eat a ton of bread or b-day cake or whatever I can&#x27;t tell the difference between indigestion due to systemic shock of my digestive system vs the stereotypical &quot;binge and fall asleep on the couch&quot; I remember from my self and observation of others.  A pizza makes me lay on the couch in a tired state like many other people I&#x27;ve observed, but I can eat a steak then go to the park with kids full of energy no problem.",1443787180

- Some corporate tax
- Income tax (your director salary, your employees salaries)
- Dividend taxes
- Capital gains tax (when I sell the company)
- Various other smaller levies<p>And you will have created some jobs. When you sell the company, those jobs also usually won&#x27;t seize to exist. In a way, you will have paid off your debt to society.<p>If at that point, should you decide to move to some low tax country and live off of investment gains, what&#x27;s wrong with that? Given (for example) a massive amount of US taxpayers dollars is spent on military and defence spending, I find it hypocritical to call people who actually want to keep their earned wealth &quot;heartless sociopaths&quot;.",1443787119

Looked at your SO answer, and feel what you  call the &#x27;narrow search approach&#x27; is what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>Above you said: > The idea is to create templates for most common questions.<p>I assume here that a template would be an abstract phrase where things like Named Entities (Seattle, Capitol Hill), Adjectives (2 bedroom), etc. are removed and substituted by variables. Correct?<p>Could supervised learning then be used to map natural language questions to templates? After all, there&#x27;s only so many ways in which you can ask a particular abstract question (i.e.: template) in a limited domain.<p>What I&#x27;m thinking then are the following steps:<p>- 1. Source questions that cover the domain. (e.g.: Mechanical Turk)<p>- 2. Manually come up with abstract templates that cover these questions. (Although somehow I feel it must be possible to semi-automate this using Wrapper Induction or something)<p>- 3. Manually label a test set <question -> template><p>- 4. Have the system learn/classify the remaining questions and test for accuracy (what classifiers would you use here?)<p>Flow of new question:<p>1. if coverage in 2 was big enough, the system should be able to infer the template.<p>2. A template should be translatable to a bunch of queries (e.g.: GraphQL format). Not the hard part I believe.<p>Out pops your answer in machine form. Bonus points to transform that answer into a Natural Language answer using some generative grammar.<p>Of course the devil is in the details but from 10,000 feet does this look solid? Suggestions/glaring omissions? Thanks again.",1443787115

Others won&#x27;t be able to follow your plan because it would require superhuman willpower.<p>I&#x27;m an example of the first category. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&#x27;&#x27; and 160 lbs, and have been like this for years. At age 27 I spent a whole year working from home, eating at McDonalds 1-2 times every day, going to sleep at 5am, and not exercising at all. Resulting weight gain? About five pounds, which I promptly lost after joining a gym. More recently, at age 32, I took a two-week vacation and literally spent it all in bed, playing video games and eating large amounts of chocolate and pastries. Resulting weight gain? Zero (actually a slight loss). This happened last month.<p>Since I&#x27;m at one extreme end of the scale, it&#x27;s very easy for me to believe that there are people at the other end, who won&#x27;t be able to follow your plan at all. Restrict them to 2K calories/day, and they just won&#x27;t fall asleep unless they get a snack. They need a different way.<p>The laws of thermodynamics are true as far as they go, but they don&#x27;t have anything to say about genetics, metabolism, hunger, or willpower. These are the real important factors in weight loss. The sooner we move away from a virtue-based worldview, the sooner we can start actually solving it.",1443786956

There are whole categories of information that do not <i>ever</i> need to be queried in bulk by a legitimate user.<p><i>> This is just security by obscurity, except if the attacker has access to the client code, it&#x27;s not even very obscure.</i><p>It&#x27;s not like this approach in any way <i>relies</i> on that obscurity, but as a measure to increase time and effort required by the hacker, I&#x27;ll take it. Just increasing the time spent figuring out how to query the backend gives site operators additional opportunities to spot that something is wrong. Compare this to the immeasurably small effort required to dump all SQL tables into a text file.<p><i>> Why can&#x27;t you do that from the database logs?</i><p>Typically logs aren&#x27;t analyzed in real time, and I&#x27;d hazard a guess in most cases they&#x27;re not even analyzed at all. Most databases don&#x27;t even keep an access log by default, and in many cases it&#x27;s hard to implement one that is useful.<p><i>> A query is just like an API call - you can raise flags if the frontend makes queries outside of a known pattern</i><p>Theoretically: yes, practically: no. In case of SQL databases, this would practically mean communicating with the DB exclusively through stored procedures (or event handlers/filters in case of document databases), which is a poor man&#x27;s version of what we&#x27;re talking about in the first place. In practice, almost nobody uses their database in this way, because it&#x27;s really painful and does not even offer that much protection.",1443784675

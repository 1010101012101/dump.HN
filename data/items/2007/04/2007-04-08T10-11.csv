Microsoft has to actually concede that web apps are the future - they still don't believe that it is!

Yes, I think it is important; men-programmers dont have good soft skills. One would have to really know such a person (from elsewhere) to know they are gifted in this area.
Perhaps I should recruit my wife :)",1176028871

I agree freeing up syntax is a very viable method for imporving codeing, but it is also very easily leads twards confusion in the minds of code maintainers.  The idea is old and has been implemented a number of times, but also it has never taken off because of the major problem with what does ""for (x) in Y {;;some more code here}"" mean?  FYI, I've implemented a flexible programming language.  They are a bear to implement.  I'm positive you don't want to go there.  Think about this.  The developer tweeks the syntax translation for the code he is working on.  What happes to all the other uses of that syntax in the program?",1176028022

Also posting it this way keeps my information intact. OT it maybe, but tough.

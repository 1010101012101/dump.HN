The two consultants we have in at the moment are both brilliant, but we&#x27;ve had a shocking one from the same firm previously, who is probably responsible for a lot of our previous problems.<p>The best advice I can give is to find someone/a firm who hires people who switch between doing and consulting. It&#x27;s a bit like the old &quot;those who can do, those who can&#x27;t, teach&quot;.  Having someone with loads of current practical experience convinces the tech types to go along with their proposal. Having someone with &quot;expert&quot; consultant credentials persuades management to go with something. Which is frustrating when an employee has been suggesting the same thing for ages, but a massive bill is convincing...<p>The other top tip - especially if they are from out of town and thus staying over - invite them to the pub at the end of day one. They want to hear the gripes of those at the coal face.",1384725573

The line could have easily been:<p>assert EnsureUnique( obj )<p>Which runs through the program&#x27;s data structures to ensure that nothing else matches a property of obj in some way.<p>Hacky, slow, but very useful to keep around if you have a constraint like that.

A significant percentage of felony convictions are for nonviolent drug offenses. In a world where the government stays out of free trade of goods between people, those convictions wouldn&#x27;t have happened, at all.<p>And, as others have mentioned, selecting for criminal background is effectively racial profiling, when implemented on a large scale. Blacks are convicted at a rate several times that of whites for the same crimes; not because they commit more of those crimes, but because they are arrested more often, they are convicted more often, and they are imprisoned more often. Time in American prisons virtually guarantees re-offending (which is a whole discussion unto itself). So, white kids who get caught and don&#x27;t end up being run through the prison system (getting off with community service or similar), get to escape the system before it escalates to felony charges, in a lot of cases.",1384725530

I do not want to draw diagrams by specifying coordinates of each and every box and label.  How do I tell it to draw a label in the center of an already placed box?<p>Is there a way/tool where diagrams can be drawn at a higher level of abstraction where the user does not have to specify each and every thing?  I have seen a few approaches, none of which sounds to be feature-complete:<p>yEd [1] lets the user draw graphs and store them in formats where they can be read by a program into a graph object.  I found it very difficult to use yEd to draw anything but graphs.<p>MS-Word includes smart art.  While I am not sure, but the storage format sounds to be something intelligent such that it would at least theoretically be possible to read the diagram programmatically into the corresponding data structure.  Only issue is that the templates are fairly limited and I cannot figure how to draw anything else.  Drawing a graph for example does not look possible.<p>Then there are UML tools that should have fit the purpose but often are not intuitive enough to use.  They are also not intended to draw general-purpose diagrams.<p>And finally mindmap-based applications that do nothing else but mindmaps.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html</a>",1384725416

The green switches are much stiffer than the blues (in a good way).  I would recommend green switches for anybody who wants a similar feel and responsiveness to the old bucking spring keyboards.  Also the CM keyboard is very well built (almost identical to Filco&#x27;s keyboards) and comes at a great price.<p>As a bit of anecdote for those who are considering buying a mechanical keyboard but aren&#x27;t sure which to buy:<p>A friend of mine has a $160 Filco with green switches that he&#x27;s been using for over a year.  He types on it at around 95 WPM.  Once I had him try out my $100 green switch cooler master.  After a few rounds on typeracer, he was averaging 110 WPM.

That implies direct costs, and it implies a breakdown of your business relationship that probably doesn&#x27;t help anyone accomplish anything or leave anyone&#x27;s reputation changed for the better.<p>Contracts serve a valuable purpose long before court filings are involved: the contractual paperwork is where you can both set out, definitively and up-front, your understanding of what the deal is. If there are significant areas of disagreement, it is <i>much</i> better to discuss them and hopefully resolve them amicably before the project starts and either of you has serious skin in the game. If that&#x27;s not possible, you can both walk with little loss and no hard feelings.

6751110,comment,6749614,6750696,2,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"Fair point, although R&#x27;s multiple dispatch barely counts as a language feature at all, but is really more of a standard add-on library (read on). All S4 is doing is using a hash table keyed by method signatures to look up which function body to call. You don&#x27;t even need any syntactic support since &quot;defining a generic function&quot; is just a matter of defining a function that does a hash lookup and then applies that function to its arguments. R doesn&#x27;t provide any syntactic support for adding methods to generics – you literally have to give it a vector of strings of argument class names. Since you can do all of this in any language – even C – it&#x27;s arguable that multiple dispatch isn&#x27;t really part of &quot;the R language&quot; at all, but rather &quot;the R system&quot; happens to ship with a standard implementation of hash-based multiple dispatch and a few of the built-in function like &quot;show&quot; and &quot;plot&quot; are defined using it.<p>Due to not being a deep language feature, S4 lacks some crucial abilities. It doesn&#x27;t support any sort of type hierarchy besides the special &quot;ANY&quot; class. Without the ability to define a type hierarchy and program to abstract types, most of the power of multiple dispatch evaporates. Even though it is technically an implementation detail, I&#x27;ve found that performance is a critical feature for multiple dispatch to really come into its own. R&#x27;s S4 dispatch has been described as &quot;slower than S3&quot; [1] – and S3 dispatch is not exactly fast. Unless really basic things like + and array indexing can be generic and usably fast, you&#x27;re not really cooking with gas.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.r-project.org/conferences/useR-2004/Keynotes/Leisch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.r-project.org/conferences/useR-2004/Keynotes/Leis...</a>",1384725115

It&#x27;s a self-reinforcing cycle...don&#x27;t get a job because of the conviction, beat yourself up and tell yourself you&#x27;re worthless because of the conviction, don&#x27;t get the next job because you interviewed horribly while worrying about and wanting to explain away the conviction.<p>One friend, however, has had a lot of years to deal with it (he was convicted of drug trafficking and spent several years incarcerated), and has started to come out the other side. When asked about his conviction, he&#x27;s not cagey about it, or apologetic about it, but he also doesn&#x27;t go overboard with explanations. He simply says what happened and that he hasn&#x27;t had any trouble with the law, or with drugs, since.<p>Besides, this is for <i>pot</i>. Nobody in California cares about pot, so most of the companies he wants to work for aren&#x27;t going to care that much about a pot conviction. Apple might (because I feel like they might be hypocritical enough to judge someone for being involved with a drug that one of the founders of the company was known to be very fond of), but I doubt Google would (but, maybe I&#x27;m wrong, I don&#x27;t have any insight into the Google hiring process these days and don&#x27;t have any inside people to ask).<p>But, I would definitely trim down the sad sack tale. Just state the facts of what the conviction was for (like &quot;I sold a gram of pot to my roommate in college&quot; or whatever), and that you&#x27;ve had no run-ins with the law since. And, I&#x27;d probably mention it if/when the company says they&#x27;re going to do a background check.<p>If I were in a hiring position (and I have been in the past, and likely will in the future), I wouldn&#x27;t consider this relevant, at all, to the decision. And, I&#x27;d probably even accept a lot &quot;worse&quot; kinds of felony than this. That may be because of my current experience with friends who have a felony in their past and with my level of knowledge of how the system works, and who the system targets (for example, white folks are far less likely to be convicted on felony charges than black folks for the same crimes, so black folks are far more likely to have a criminal record, even if they just did the same sorts of things me and all my white friends did growing up).",1384725017

Otherwise good luck with trying to convert a contract into actual dollars because you are right.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been around for some time and I absolutely would not say this. A contract is not primarily about being adversarial. It&#x27;s about being <i>clear</i>. There&#x27;s a huge difference. A contract is the end-point of the conversation you have that clarifies as much as you can before anyone starts work or writes a check.<p>If someone is planning on making your life hell, a contract won&#x27;t stop them. It&#x27;s a piece of paper, after all, and, yes, if lawyers have to get involved then pretty much everyone has lost. Preventing that scenario is less about getting a contract and more about learning to assess people and decide who is legitimate and who is full of shit so you can walk away before any contract ever gets written.<p>(Negotiating a contract, by the way, is a pretty good measure of what it&#x27;s going to be like to work with someone. Consider it your first project together. If it goes poorly, that might be a bad sign about how the whole project will go...)",1384724983

I don&#x27;t have any statistics to validate, but it seems that posting new submissions rewards more karma points than responding to submissions. Maybe the Admins/Mods could run some stats and see if this is true or not. While I do not personally care about karma points (I&#x27;m here because I actually enjoy the community), basing the ability to vote (as in, influence the ranking of what is presented) on a single metric that does not differentiate between submissions and comments likely results in a skewed representation of the community.<p>To put it simply, if you want lots of karma points, don&#x27;t bother responding to submissions (presumably in an attempt to help someone with a problem, or contribute to the conversation). Instead just find some &quot;hot&quot; controversial articles on some other tech related news sites and submit them instead. If this is true, then it should not be surprising that there is more &quot;white noise&quot; here at HackerNews, as this approach facilitates submitting stories instead of contributing to conversations.<p>My recommendation (if anyone cares), break karma points up into two separate values, one related to submitting articles/stories (which is valuable), and another related to submitting comments (which is also valuable). Then I would remove any reference of points from the system (make them hidden from users) as to remove any desire to &quot;game the system&quot; for points.

Probably not.  But it&#x27;s important to be able to have some form of shield from the casual observer, to have a name and identity that <i>you</i> choose, rather than having one chosen for you, which may reveal far more than you intended.<p>Yes, I post publicly on G+, and sacrifice some level of privacy in doing so -- I do it because I enjoy the level of discourse on that site, and talking with interesting strangers is part of the fun.  On the other hand, I deliberately didn&#x27;t link that profile with any of my other online identities . . . and, while I may not have done a perfect job of it, I at least did my best to create walls between those personae.<p>As Dredmorbius said, it&#x27;s important that users be able to maintain those walls if they choose, without a service provider choosing to collapse them and merge those identities without permission.  By using their services, I did <i>not</i> consent to that action (in fact, repeatedly refused their attempts to do so), and if given a choice between leaving the Google-services hive and having my legal identity attached to everything I&#x27;ve ever written, I&#x27;d leave.<p>What is deceptive and duplicitous about this latest G+/YouTube action, is that many users who <i>expressly refused</i> the &quot;offer&quot; to merge accounts were merged without permission, and often those merges revealed personal information that the users had not chosen to share with YouTube.<p>I find that <i>intensely</i> disturbing, and I am seriously hoping that some type of action is taken against Google, as with Buzz, regarding the breach of private user information.",1384723593

Thus creating a scarcity of the instrument which when executed well will be followed by enough hype, as the common people usually see the &quot;meteoric growth&quot; as proof of a good investment and &quot;a large number&quot; of people believing in its future, rather than the reality of a handful.<p>This creates a situation where a lot of these novice/late investors start buying the security, usually using market orders (i.e. accepting the sellers offered price). Now since a handful of entities own a large number of the instrument and they offer few shares incrementally at higher levels, and keep selling more and more as the hype/momentum/# of small investors increases.<p>Eventually taking it to a point where a large amount(still not the majority) of the instrument is now owned by a large number of small investors hoping to make 10x-1000x like the early investors did. At which point they have a few choices/combination of choices(all :\n1) Offer a large amount at a price point where the gen. public will not find it valuable, thus leaving only one direction for prices to go\n2) Create a small sell-off by selling large quantities through a market order, thus making smaller investors panic\n3) Wait it out to let the news, govts or some other external source to present a good opportunity for people to panic, and do one of the above\n4) If they are big enough they can actually create #3<p>A well executed would further buy back the instrument while it crashes for a round of rinse-and-repeat.<p>There are a lot of examples of pump-and-dumps, a lot of them are legitimate, most are well established and usually don&#x27;t intend losses for the later investors. The &quot;dump&quot; can just be profit taking, reducing risk, being satisfied with the earning etc. All companies that have raised financing can technically be classified as PnD<p>ex 1(legitimate):\n(i) 2 individuals + 2 computers + 1 idea (100% share) [$10,000 valuation/opportunity cost.] => (ii) YC give 3-8% of share for $20k [25x to 67x profit on equity given] => ... so on ..<p>ex 2(classic PnD - There are plenty worth mentioning):\nCrude oil futures rally from mid &#x27;08 - to its subsequent crash in early &#x27;09. I can write a thesis on this one. It was great fun, good times.<p>ex 3(currently playing out): Bitcoin :\nThis does not undermine the quality of the idea or its execution. Just the fact that a small number of early miners control a large quantity of the instrument. Prices are being driven up by mostly small order-sizes being executed on the sell side (not to be confused with [0]). There is a higher probability that these bitcoin&#x27;s are being sold by early adopters.<p>It may be a few weeks early to say if it is a classic pump-and-dump.

Referring to a thyroid test known as thyroid-stimulating hormone, the employee wrote that “a patient would swing between” hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, or too little of the hormone and too much, when the test was repeated the same day.</i><p>This sounds really bad. When you have this huge amount of uncertainty in results, it calls into question their whole finger prick blood sampling methodology. I&#x27;m starting to think that it&#x27;s impossible to get an accurate blood work from a finger prick only.",1450673977

10769646,comment,10768076,10768172,0,0,jclulow,,,"I tend to find that shorter, putatively simpler bash scripts are often shorter because they don&#x27;t do adequate (or, at times, any) checking of error conditions.  It is deceptively easy to write a terse shell script when you assume that every command, or pipeline of commands, will work exactly as you expect every time.<p>In practice, even simple operations like &quot;rm&quot;, or &quot;mkdir&quot;, or even &quot;cd&quot; can fail in new and exciting ways.  The blanket use of &quot;errexit&quot; and &quot;pipefail&quot; is really only the bare minimum of error handling; scripts that simply _stop_ as soon as a command exits non-zero are not generally an operable product that somebody unfamiliar with the innards of the system can be expected to work with.<p>It is also unfortunately easy to miss out on putting quotes around expansions, or to get caught out by the somewhat peculiar behaviour of variable scoping in functions.  Some improved constructs are available in more recent versions of bash, but if the goal is to be _portable_ (without also shipping your target bash binary) you may not be able to use some or any of them.<p>The bash &quot;language&quot; (such as it is) is antiquated and clunky, because it seeks to be backwards compatible with the rich tapestry of history that is the Bourne shell.  A truly robust, operable program written in this environment often does not come out a whole lot shorter (if it is shorter at all) than a program written in another language with better facilities.",1450673594

10769643,comment,10768720,10769290,0,0,iheartmemcache,,,"You&#x27;re really going to have a hard time finding something that satisfies your 3 requirements (open source, high-speed and capable of what a Juniper Netscreen can do). OpenBSD can be tuned to operate really well, hit maybe 80 or 90% feature parity with those Netscreens, but the performance won&#x27;t even come close to what a Netscreen can do -- Juniper fabs their own ASICs and a general von Neumann x86 won&#x27;t come close to being able to packet switching at those speeds.<p>You might be able to get close in performance with your high-end Altera&#x27;s and Xilinx&#x27;s gear, but that certainly won&#x27;t be cheap and AFAIK the FPGA synthesis tools are still closed source -- so you&#x27;re not going to get an &#x27;open source&#x27; from top-to-bottom solution at all 3 levels (Silicon, firmware, OS and packet switching). It&#x27;s arguably more trust-worthy than buying Juniper/Cisco which has complete control of the stack, from silicon to software, but you&#x27;ll be paying through the nose either way.<p>The standard Intel e1000&#x27;s running OpenBSD and libpacket might be the best trade-off you&#x27;re going to get in price/performance (again, if you make the concession that Intel isn&#x27;t backdooring on: a) the firmware and/or drivers for the e1000s, or b) somewhere along the controller bus path -> PHY on the processor). This whitepaper [1] re: OmniPath + Xeon/PHI architecture boasts brilliant numbers (page 7 for an architecture summary, column 2 for the network switching summary, page 8 for the benchmark numbers). Again, not open-source at the hardware level, but the drivers, libraries and OS can all be audited. And at those rates of transmission, I&#x27;m guessing you could use physical probing along each component to see if any deep-packet tomfoolery is occurring, as the latency increase would be detectable, and you can&#x27;t just add an extra login password at that level.<p>Tyan&#x27;s OpenPOWER compliant stack will run on BSD and other than the processor (which uses an IBM POWER8) pretty much uses jellybean components-- so you get what I&#x27;m going to coin as &quot;security through vendor diversity&quot; from now.[2]<p>It comes down to how tightly your tin-foil hat has been sized I suppose. The upside is right now there&#x27;s a huge open-source hardware revolution going on. OpenCores&#x27; Virtex based RISC stuff is available and that&#x27;s top-to-bottom open source, and if you were really motivated and had the engineering know-how, ASIC runs can be done for under a million.<p>[1] <a href=""https://ramcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/22478857/20150902-IntelOmniPath-WhitePaper_2015-08-26-Intel-OPA-FINAL.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1441327130864&api=v2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ramcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/224...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tyan.com/campaign/openpower/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tyan.com/campaign/openpower/index.html</a>",1450673566

It was mostly for kicks because I was a violinist at the time and needed a break from my music theory courses.<p>But when I got into the market research industry and started writing statistical software, I found serious problems with assumptions everywhere I looked. It seemed to me that there&#x27;s a real problem with the way people with informal or introductory experience dealt with statistical results, with the relationship between null and alternative hypotheses, and with the evidence generated by sampling processes.<p>This is probably largely irrelevant to high-level Physicists, but I think it&#x27;s at least partly relevant when we talk about what is and isn&#x27;t falsifiable.<p>There&#x27;s a comment in the piece where a guy says that Astrology is falsifiable, so we know that shouldn&#x27;t be the only criteria for something to count as Science. I think he&#x27;s on to something there because I think the fundamental hypothesis of Astrology is so far out of whack that it shouldn&#x27;t have been considered.<p>There&#x27;s nothing behind astrology that&#x27;s any better than a bad if p then q statement. But we have no way of evaluating these by form. One can simple say, &quot;If the grass is green, then the moon is made of blue cheese.&quot; This is formally a valid statement.<p>The problem I encounter many times (anecdotally, of course) is that people don&#x27;t treat this statement as a material implication. They treat it as a logical conjunct. So that seems somewhat safe in the grass/moon example. They make the mistake of thinking of it as simply as, &quot;If the grass is green AND the moon is made of blue cheese . . .&quot; Well, that&#x27;s clearly false. So why bother?<p>But a material implication has consequences. You can flip it around and say (by axiom) that if p then q then !q implies !p. I can assert that green grass => blue cheese moon. And if you accept that as valid, you can likewise assert that !blue cheese moon => !green grass.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see the flaws in this contrived example, but it&#x27;s often very difficult to see these problems in realistic examples when you are looking at effect sizes in medicine, or changes in advertising techniques, or samples from thermometers, or the kinds of things that I have no knowledge of in theoretical Physics.<p>It&#x27;s often very difficult to assess when a scientific study has any realistic relationship between a null and alternative hypothesis. It would be nice if it were all statistically about whether or not these two numbers are the same or different, but that&#x27;s frequently not the case.<p>I think the idea is correct, that we do need Philosophers to come up with a better system. Even something as simple as &quot;The subject of a material implication must be included in the predicate of the material implication.&quot; might be a good start. Although it&#x27;s woefully naive.<p>It would be kind of interesting to see people testing hypothesis in the scientific world that were formulated as syllogisms.<p>i.e., based on studies x, y, and z we can make the following claims:\nall (or some--doesn&#x27;t matter. Most &quot;some&quot; claims can be reduced to a subset of &quot;all&quot; claims) x are y\nThis study shows that z is x\nTherefore z is y<p>Is it limiting and problematic? Of course. Where do new categories happen?<p>Well, there are negations. You can prove that phenomenon z is not a member of previously known phenomena and is therefore something else.<p>While I think a great many of people sort of feel this way about stuff, I think there&#x27;s a reason to codify it formally. Because so many people don&#x27;t think very clearly about these things in aggregate.<p>It seems kind of ugly. But it would be an improvement over what we have now, which is basically a free-for-all in certain realms of science, where any sufficiently complex idea is grounds for further research, even when the possibilities of proof are non-existent. I say that more to the social sciences than I do the theoretical physicists of the world, so perhaps I&#x27;m off point here.<p>But my general idea is that, yes, philosophy can and should step it up a bit.",1450671028

In an ideal Forth codebase, most definitions are about a line long, contain at most one control structure and reference no named variables.<p>Forth&#x27;s stack-oriented semantics make function calls very cheap- a function call and return is literally two instructions, whereas languages which use activation records will turn a function call into dozens of instructions- copying arguments around, backing up registers, etc. Since it&#x27;s computationally inexpensive, you don&#x27;t need to sweat over whether your optimizing compiler will manage to inline a function.<p>Short, simple and mostly pure functions are easy to test in isolation- there aren&#x27;t deeply nested code paths to exercise.<p>Lots of short functions allow your codebase to reuse more of those functions- any redundancy can be collapsed together, both shrinking the codebase and improving test coverage. This effect is magnified in more complex programs.<p>You can do this sort of thing in other languages, but forth&#x27;s syntax <i>and</i> semantics for function definition and invocation are both very lightweight, and this makes it much easier to apply.",1450670815

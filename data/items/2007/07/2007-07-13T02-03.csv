33963,comment,33931,33931,0,0,astocko,,,"LOL @ Willarson's comment<p>Reading about ColdFusion stirs up feelings of nostalgia for me. I remember being a young teen interested in web application development and somehow I got my hands on the Allaire ColdFusion Web Application Construction Kit published by Forta and Que. None the less, that was a short lived experience (fortunately) and I had quickly moved on to perl.",1184295137
33962,comment,33848,33848,0,0,staunch,,,"Just like focusing on a tiny idea is immensely difficult (and powerful), so is trying to focus on a few users. The temptation in both cases is to hedge your bets by concentrating on more.<p>This applies perfectly to my soon-to-launch project. My partner and I have made a conscious decision to shut ourselves up about taking over the world and just concentrate on getting a few core users that are in love with our product. Stage 1.<p>",1184295096

Traffic has grown even faster: Europeans viewed 2.5 billion MySpace pages in May (the most recent month for which figures are available), compared with 1.1 billion a year earlier, says market tracker Nielsen//NetRatings.""",1184294711

So it does seem to only be the most extreme cases.<p>There are some very popular forum sites that have existed for years and maintained civility. Any Reddit-type site could learn a lot from them. They almost all have a group of core users who act as moderators and enforce a set of published rules. It's critical that they not make up the rules on the fly, otherwise users won't respect the decisions.

33958,comment,33886,33916,0,0,ryanmahoski,,,"I wonder if there may be a way to build the wall you describe in the general-public site. Pretend you could rate commenters, not publicly but privately--for your own private use. If you spot a particularly dumb comment on reddit, you could blacklist the commenter--privately, so that your action would affect only you. Similarly, when you notice a brilliant comment you will want to permanently highlight its author so that for you--and only you--the author has an advantage on your attention in the future. Commenters you perceive as intolerable would never have another shot at your attention while commenters you view as geniuses would forever get artificially modded up--but only to your eyes. <p>The same algorithm could work for postings. If I want more Ron Paul, peace be upon Him, I can privately champion those authors who celebrate his news items. You may have had enough of the distinguished doctor-representative from Texas, so you could exercise your prerogative to ignore (or artificially down-mod, just for you) submitters whom you view are overly sympathetic to Him.<p>Further thoughts on reddit's comment system...<p>Problem: Logical fallacies largely go unchecked. Just today, someone replying to my comment pulled a tautology so I reflexively linked to the appropriate Wikipedia page. As mentioned, ad hominem is a more popular sin and the list goes on. What if, when I clicked on the ""Report"" link, I could select from several logical fallacies? In this way, if enough others agreed with me, we could get an official-looking stamp on the offending comment--corresponding to what the community felt was the logical fallacy (e.g., straw man, false analogy, non sequitur).<p>Problem: Today, if I submit a comment and I down-mod all other comments I increase my comment's visibility. I want my comment to have visibility (that is why I wrote it) and I suspect other redditors may employ the cheat. So I face an ethical dilemma. We can talk about real-life karma, but why tease commenters to begin with? Solution: If you comment you can't vote in the thread.<p>Problem: I imagine a lot of redditors, like me, sort by top->flat and I suspect most of the remaining redditors sort by top->nested. So if I comment, I significantly increase my visibility odds if I reply to the front-runner comment. To the extent I care that people will read what I write, I will tend to favor the popular comments--even if they are not as worthy of a response as those nearer the bottom.",1184292908
33957,comment,33886,33952,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Sure you could.  You could also select all comments on the item and rebuild the tree in-memory, as Vlad suggests elsewhere on this thread.  The code isn't even as hard as I'd thought it'd be:<p><pre><code>  comments = dbh.query('SELECT * FROM comments WHERE news_id = $newsid')
  response_tree = {}
  for comment in comments:
      comment.children = []
      response_tree[comment.id] = comment
  for comment in comments:
      response_tree[comment.parent_id].children.append(comment)
</code></pre>
The nifty thing about storing it in the database is that you need <i>no</i> application-level post-processing, you can take advantage of the DB for ad-hoc queries (what if you want to show subtrees of all posts by a certain user, like the ""threads"" page here?), and it happens to map to a set of simple and fast operations provided by most databases.",1184292885

Rats/mice have a very different level of metabolism than humans do just because of scale.<p>Basically there&#x27;s a fudge factor of 0.75.  Of course, the following article goes on to explain that it&#x27;s actually drug mechanism dependent as well.  Very complicated stuff!<p>&quot;The value of the exponent for whole body metabolic rate was originally calculated by Max Kleiber in 1932 to be 0.74 (Kleiber, 1932). A few years later, Brody et al. published their famous mouse to elephant curve and calculated the exponent to be 0.734 (Brody, 1945). A value of 0.75 is now accepted because it is easier to use, and the difference from 0.734 is considered to be statistically negligible (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984). However, it should be noted that exponents in the range 0.6–0.8 have been reported for metabolic rate (Agutter and Wheatley, 2004). A value of 0.75 means that the whole body metabolic rate increases as body weight increases, but to a lesser extent than would be expected of a simple proportional relationship. It follows on from this that the specific metabolic rate (the metabolic rate per unit mass) decreases as animals get larger (the exponent is −0.25); the metabolic rate of 1 g blue whale tissue is 1000 times less than that of 1 g shrew tissue (Kirkwood, 1983).&quot;<p>from:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737649/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737649/</a>",1410990663

I don&#x27;t know about Spencer&#x27;s unnamed &quot;followers&quot;, but he was not quite what you would call a fan of the colonialism of his day:<p>> That a government cannot undertake to administer the affairs of a colony, and to support for it a judicial staff, a constabulary, a garrison, and so forth, without trespassing against the parent society, scarcely needs pointing out.<p>> Moreover, colonial government, properly so called, cannot be carried on without transgressing the rights of the colonists. For if, as generally happens, the colonists are dictated to by authorities sent out from the mother country, then the law of equal freedom is broken in their persons, as much as by any other kind of autocratic rule.<p>From Social Statics, Chapter 27, Section 1 (available at <a href=""http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/spencer-social-statics-1851"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/spencer-social-statics-185...</a> ).",1410990307

Generally with tech-related stuff I&#x27;m the most knowledgeable and up-to-date family member, but I completely miss the train when it comes to social apps sometimes. I think this is because I&#x27;m older, geographically isolated from young people, and grew up without a cellphone at all. I definitely had a phase where I was obsessed with joining things ASAP (remember Pownce?), but I feel like I&#x27;ve been done with that part of my connected life for a few years. I use instagram, but don&#x27;t follow anyone except immediate family members or close friends, I have 0 exposure to the super popular &quot;celebrity&quot; accounts because I rarely use or search for hashtags. I still don&#x27;t use Snapchat, and recently one of my brothers was shocked that I didn&#x27;t use Venmo.<p>A particular thing that I&#x27;ve found really odd is that I have trouble getting a text response from my siblings, even though I know they have their phones on them and are constantly snapchatting, or whatever. I text a lot, but maybe get one response for every 5-10 texts I send.<p>I think the one extremely consistent app in my family is Spotify, although it&#x27;s fairly rare for any of us to use its social functions. From my parents down through all the kids, everyone uses Spotify quite a bit.<p>The younger siblings don&#x27;t seem to care about or understand data limits as much.

At most colleges, it&#x27;s not the professors who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they are nowhere near as smart. They&#x27;re the NCOs of the intellectual world. They can&#x27;t tell how smart you are. The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.<p>Few parents would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn&#x27;t improve their admissions prospects. Prep schools openly say this is one of their aims. But what that means, if you stop to think about it, is that they can hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he went to the local public school. [6]<p>[6] I don&#x27;t mean to imply that the only function of prep schools is to trick admissions officers. They also generally provide a better education. But try this thought experiment: suppose prep schools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.001) negative effect on college admissions. How many parents would still send their kids to them?<p>It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because they&#x27;ve learned more, are better college candidates. But this seems empirically false. What you learn in even the best high school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college. Public school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage, but they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just that they are within any given college. That follows necessarily if you agree prep schools improve kids&#x27; admissions prospects.)<p>-----------<p>I&#x27;m going to go with &quot;unfair advantage,&quot; but there are a lot of smart people there too.",1410988584

Making root beer the traditional way is possible at home, as is buying or harvesting sassafras.<p>Sassafras tastes and smells very much like root beer, as you would expect, except &quot;more&quot;. That is the best way I can describe it. It has a flavor profile that is more complete than what you get in standard root beers. As the above article states, it is pretty difficult to get a satisfactory extract from it. The smell of the root/bark is great, but the concentration/taste of the brewed liquid is very difficult to gauge. It requires significant amounts of sugar to make it taste &quot;like root beer&quot;.<p>To get around the challenges with Safrole, the root beer industry turned first to Wintergreen, which is a very similar flavor profile, and it is wintergreen,or artificial wintergreen that makes up the bulk of modern day commercial root beers. Boutique makers also include vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and other botanicals to get a flavor they want, but Wintergreen is the key to modern root beer. Many online recipes include many of these ingredients too. I&#x27;ve never had much luck with them.<p>I&#x27;ve made some of these myself before, and always had an exceptional difficulty getting the flavors to be concentrated enough to even approach the commercial stuff - perhaps my ingredients or methods were sub-par. I always wanted to get a mixture that I could make strong enough without making it too sweet. The difficulty there is that it is hard to make any mixture strong enough to mix with carbonated water, or, it is hard to carbonate by fermentation without adding significant amounts of sugar.(over time, I&#x27;ve made probably 10 attempts at this, and bought several hundred dollars worth of ingredients/equipment. I&#x27;ve had much better luck with real beer.)<p>Finally, as a caveat, do not attempt to eat or cook with any wintergreen oil, or wintergreen essential oil. It is almost pure Methyl Salicylate - According to wikipedia, 1 fl oz of wintergreen oil is equivalent to taking 55g of aspirin, equivalent to 171 adult sized tablets. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintergreen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintergreen</a>",1410987773

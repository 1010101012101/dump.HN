I found it interesting that I hated the interface for probably the reasons that you hate pivotal.<p>IMO one of the great strengths of pivotal is that there is a single view of the project.  While tools such as mantisbt allow you to track lots of information (such as severity and interdependency) I'm not actually interested in this information beyond using it to decide what order work should be done. Pivotal forces you to resolve these factors into an ordering and in doing so provides a much simpler/clearer view of a project.<p>You could argue that not having this extra information makes reprioritisation harder. In practice I've found that this extra information is often subjective or temporary e.g. how severe an issue is/we really need this feature! I've always found that tracking these opinions is pointless as they change with such frequency that the tool is out of date anyway (ever hear arguments starting with ""but you said it was severe two weeks ago""). In the end my experience is that people always know what the important issues are when prioritising, they don't need to keep them in a tool. They also appreciate a simple view of a project which I think pivotal does very well.",1273852768

1347624,comment,1347131,1347131,0,0,pilif,,,"I'm totally agreeing with the general sentiments of the comments here: I see no particular issue with public comments being publicly searchable.<p>I can even kind of understand facebook's drive to make as much information as possible public and hence changing the defaults while still providing a bit of warning to the user.<p>Sure - nobody reads that, but that's ultimately the problem of the people not reading the warnings.<p>However, In light of this, the ethical thing for facebook would be not to change defaults for existing users but maybe just to encourage them to post more stuff to the public. And, depending on ""evilness"", change the default for new users.<p>What's really scary is the sharing of information with other sites and applications that's going on. By now it's really hard to find any mobile App that doesn't in a way want to integrate facebook and send spam in my name.<p>But it just got worse in the recent days: Now we learn that even the basic iPhone OS might get facebook integration, that battle.net (blizzard's online game platfrom) will be poisoned by facebook and of course there's that site-wide-""like""-feature which shares who knows what data (that might even be private) with third parties I might or might not trust.<p>IMHO, there's a difference between just posting something to the general public and providing that information directly to an interested third-party.<p>It's like in real life: In theory, the mall could just watch me doing grocery shopping in public, because, after all, that's a public action.<p>But the moment they hand me one of these customer bonus program cards, I know they are tracking me specifically and this is what I'm uncomfortable with - even thought the information they could get from that is public already - now it's directed straight at them.<p>That's the difference.<p>While I don't care about somebody using facebook search looking for the term ""foobar"" and then finding a posting of mine amongst 100 others, I strongly care about a third party getting direct notifications of my interests in foobar as I am visiting their service.<p>The connection is what's annoying me. Being one of a million interested in foobar is ok. Being returning visitor #1257892 to site X and also being interested in foobar (without explicitly telling them and disguised in a ""fancy"" ""I like this""-button) - that's the problem I have.<p>I'm solving this not by quitting facebook (which has some value in keeping in touch with old non-techie friends and classmates), but by always logging out after use. Then, I set all my updates to public and I'm only posting what I don't care about the public seeing. Problem solved for me.<p>The content on the internet that's beside my name is, in full, things I can be proud of and I can stand behind. There are no drunken pictures or anything else I could be afraid of any past or future boss seeing it.",1273852725

Googling for Android dev stuff is a pain as you get a lot of strange and barely useful Google groups threads and clones.<p>As for books, I bought a beginners book to get started, but you're probably beyond that if you have Java experience.<p>The Google examples and dev starter page are enough to get rolling actually.<p>Also, regarding targeting devices; in your manifest, you can set a lowest possible SDK and a target SDK and compile against 1.6, and then allow for the device to do the density control and you can almost target all the devices in one APK.  You just have to make sure not to use any code that doesn't work in the 1.5/1.6 versions of Android - but if you're in eclipse, it will help out a little with this.  My games are getting downloaded by 1.5 users and Droid 2.x users.<p>I think the thing you'll hate the most right out of the gate is the 24-hour return policy in the Android market - especially since you're coming from iPhone.<p>People can buy your app, but you don't know if it's a sale for 24 hours when it finally closes.  In that limbo time, they get to use it for free and just by uninstalling they get their money back - or rather - their transaction never happens.  It's great for the end user, but hard to cope with as a developer who thinks they have sales, but overnight they just go away every now and then.  I've had up to 25% cancellation rates on bad days.<p>Whatever you are creating, I hope it has repeat value, I think that's one of the only ways to get around the cancellation problem.",1273852484

(Note: I am an Intuit Employee)<p>The crux of the matter is: How should the discount be applied, when there are multiple line items - taxable and non-taxable? One way of applying it is to say that the discount will be split equally between the line items that precede the discount.<p>In your example, there is a discount of $1, and there are two line items, one taxable, the other not. The software splits the discounts between the two line items. So there is 50c of taxable discount applied to item 1 (taxable), 50c of non-taxable applied to item 2 (non-taxable)<p>Well, then the calculation becomes more apparent. The calculation becomes<p>( 50c taxable + (50c*8%tax)) + 50c non-taxable<p>for a total of $1.04.<p>This way of calculating has been validated over a decade by Quickbooks users and accountants, so I do not consider it a defect. If you want to accomplish it differently, you can always apply a discount to a subtotal. If you look up Quickbooks help, you will find an entry for<p>'How is sales tax calculated for a discounted sale? '<p>That explains the behavior in great detail.<p>Hope this helps.

There are webhosts out there which specialize in Ruby deployments which is a big win if you see Ruby as a web language.<p>However, I would disagree on the comparison with Python which has a much larger community base than Ruby. Rails may be more popular than Django but Python has even penetrated desktop apps like Hg, Bazaar, Meld etc. which is one area Ruby is still to affect significantly. But having said that, Scala, Clojure and especially Go are not nearly as popular as Ruby or Python.",1273849524

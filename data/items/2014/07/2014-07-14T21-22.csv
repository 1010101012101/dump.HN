Handoff to iBasis is hardly &quot;encrypted to the PSTN&quot; for any worthwhile value of PSTN.<p>The ZRTP part is fine if you can bring your own client. And I guess $12 a month isn&#x27;t much to pay for SC to run FreeSWITCH as a NAT traversal/endpoint discovery platform.<p>There&#x27;s still no real details on how we&#x27;re supposed to trust Silent Circle from being actively attacked and backdooring clients. If memory serves me correctly Mr. Zimmerman said they&#x27;re relying on the government not being able to compel them to cooperate. AKA, Lavabit-style. (Sure, ZRTP is solid, but a compromised client isn&#x27;t detectable to end-users, plus SC talks a lot about calling the PSTN.)<p>For a comparison to a company that takes security seriously, look at tarsnap. Then go read the PR from Mike Janke the other day.<p>On another note, what does &quot;100% dedicated network – no sharing or leasing&quot; even mean? Did SC run fibre from Toronto to Switzerland? How is SC&#x27;s network any different from any other VoIP company that builds a datacenter?",1405375150

Generally speaking, when someone says to arrive at a particular event 5-10 minutes early, it is simply so that everyone can be seated and things can get going at the prescribed time, 6:00PM, not that the participants should disregard the stated start time of the event. Plus, if the story that the company representative was rude is true, then that is not cool for the exact reason that the participant specified.

Sometimes this is intentional, but I suspect that is a fairly small minority.<p>The central problem: trying to apply the concept of <i>money</i> and <i>economics</i> to packets doesn&#x27;t work, because money and economics are tools for handling <i>scarce resources</i>, while the major benefit of the modern &quot;digital age&quot; is that you can copy those bits without a per-copy cost[1]. As bits are not scarce, &quot;pay per GB&quot; becomes a case of applying to wrong tool or trying to solve the wrong problem.<p>Observing that the infinite scalability of bits isn&#x27;t leading to free high-speed internet for everybody, a better question is: which resources really are scarce? These are the costs that billing should be based upon.<p>With networking, those costs are things like creating the network hardware, installing it, and maintaining that hardware. The first two are a one-time cost. We usually distribute that kind of high-variance, unpredictable cost into &quot;monthly payments&quot; in a variety of industries, and tthe maintenance costs are inherently a &quot;per-unit-time&quot; cost as well. This includes the expensive routers that you <i>need to have anyway</i> to be able to tolerate variations in usage[2]. At no point does the contents (&quot;number of packets&quot;) enter into this as a cost.<p>A common rebuttal to the idea of usage not being a cost is to point out the problem of saturation and how an oversubscribed line would the ISP to make expensive upgrades. This problem <i>does</i> exist, and should be part of the billing... because it is a problem about <i>bandwidth</i>, not <i>bits</i>. You don&#x27;t get to keep billing someone indefinitely for a one-time cost. Attempting to do make up costs like that would be rent-seeking[3].<p>Various ISPs have shown that billing for a given amount of bandwidth (at some defined defined guarantee of service) can easily be profitable.<p>[1] Electricity costs are not relevant, and are often not relevant anyway in physical layers where you have to send an empty carrier if there is no data. Most of the rest of the &quot;costs&quot; are associated with <i>using</i> those bits (see: CMOS), which is addressed above.<p>[2] The specific amount of tolerance required being defined by the guarantees (sometimes with SLA) offered by the ISP.<p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_seeking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_seeking</a>",1405373880

Money can&#x27;t be paid as an outright bribe (I&#x27;m sure it happens, but is pretty rare) but rather in the form of campaign contributions, or occasionally in direct political advertising. Recent Supreme Court rulings have really removed any restrictions on how much can be spent by independent political groups even if they are 100% sponsored by corporations or trade groups or whoever. Wheeler is an appointed leader of an executive branch agency, meaning that he has no campaign fund.

But when it comes to losing the queue, if we&#x27;re tracking what we&#x27;ve put on the queue and whether we&#x27;ve received an acknowledgement or not, we can easily replay events to that queue (B).  If we didn&#x27;t track what we put on the queue, how do you recover in (A)?<p>As I see it, the database represents a consistent view of the application state and data -- e.g. &quot;payment 123 was settled&quot;.  If you lose your database, you have to restore, then move upstream and replay events there (if possible). Downstream systems handle duplicates in replay scenarios by discarding them. This is a nice straightforward way to recover. If you lose your queue, it&#x27;s not an issue, because the queue is just a channel and you replay events over it. What&#x27;s important is your higher-level protocol across the channel.<p>In my mind the pattern is:  S -> channel -> R.  Channel can be a brokered queue, a brokerless standalone queue, async IPC, a thread delivering messages ala ZMQ, a file, a web API, raw UDP, whatever, but either way its the same pattern -- S tracks its sending state, it doesn&#x27;t trust the channel because if things break you don&#x27;t have a consistent view of your downstream obligations that you can recover from. The channel&#x27;s job is to deal with delivery, but it can&#x27;t address higher-level concerns <i>across</i> the channel.<p>We put messages onto queues as part of a higher level abstraction -- we use TCP/IP, for instance, as part of an HTTP <i>conversation</i>:  if a web browser sends a GET and doesn&#x27;t get a response, it doesn&#x27;t just sit waiting forever hoping the TCP/IP stack will figure things out... It recovers and maybe even retries but warns you about the problem so that you notice you typed the wrong IP address in and fix it.  TCP/IP is a nice unreliable example, but whatever your channel is, it&#x27;s going to be unreliable, so in our business applications we need a business-case specific protocol to record our business transactional state as well to handle the failures. If you offload that obligation to the channel, you&#x27;re stuffed because the channel can&#x27;t understand your business case and consequently how will you recover?<p>Unless you mean you can design systems with a degree of fault tolerance so great that its not worth considering failures?  That can&#x27;t be right, what am I missing?",1405371901

It was evil, very obviously, but if anything it speaks against the idea that High Modernism is always doomed to fail in implementing its abstract designs.<p>To your main point: I would go a step further, and say that governments and organizations &quot;bite off more than they can chew&quot; because it&#x27;s fundamentally impossible for individual leadership to fully comprehend a larger system to enforce a policy on. Abstractions always obliterate local knowledge; worse off, it&#x27;s usually impossible to even know the unknowns that are being blown away.

Smart, technical-minded people are especially prone to this fallacy: see the everlasting temptation to shove waterfall processes into Agile rhetoric.<p>I&#x27;m taking some time to digest this article, but I like it a lot, and I think it might fit in with some thoughts I&#x27;ve been trying to solidify for awhile. Going back to Rumsfeld, he had a trio of the known knowns, the known unknowns, and the unknown unknowns. I want to argue there&#x27;s a forth category, however: the unknown knowns. In other words, institutions and networks of individuals may be isomorphic to real data and the algorithms that work on it, even though no individual needs to know about the data or algorithms actually being implemented, any more than a register would need to know what bits lies inside it. We thus embed knowledge into society: we&#x27;ve created an emergent social computation through unplanned collective activity.

I&#x27; asking this because I have a heavy OO background and even when C is not entirely strange to me, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s as easy as to make a weekend project with that or not so much.<p>Your thoughts on this? Did you chain together more than one?<p>Thanks for your comments!",1405371638

I also didn&#x27;t notice the image was 3d movable.<p>A simple way to convey the idea might be to show the count of each logo color used in the image on the side. Or maybe animate the building of the mosaic?<p>Neat idea though, I think kids would have a lot of fun with this.",1405371606

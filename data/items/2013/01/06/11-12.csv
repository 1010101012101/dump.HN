I was disappointed that Bombadil and his immunity to the Ring didn't show, for instance. But while the Scouring of the Shire was immensely critical to the books, it was also profoundly anticlimactic: it would have broken the simpler narrative of the movies to pull in those more complex themes to have a second climax.<p>As it was, Jackson only barely managed to hang the two main plotlines together. They didn't <i>need</i> a connection in the books, but it's much more challenging in a movie format. It might have been worth it to split <i>The Two Towers</i>  into two films in order to give each its room. (Frodo and Sam from the Breaking to the escape from Cirith Ungol in Film 2; Aragorn and Gandalf's contests with Theoden, Saruman, and Denethor as a very long Film 3; and twisting the two back together in 4 with room for the Scouring.) Nolan managed it in The Dark Knight, where after the Joker was beaten, there was one final emotional explosion. So it <i>can</i> be done. I don't know if Jackson could have done it.",1357472679

6112018,comment,6111816,6111816,3,0,mikevm,,,"> Anyone who has come into personal contact with an inspiring professor at the top of his or her field knows that the experience can&#x27;t be reproduced by remote control; my own entire graduate school experience was made worthwhile by a single extraordinary teacher, without whom it might have been an utter waste of time.<p>As a CS undergrad, I can tell you that I&#x27;ve studied under a few professors that are famous academically, but the lectures themselves were nothing to write home about. In fact, when video was available for a course, I&#x27;d save myself an hour of commuting and just watch the lecture at home.<p>There might be certain disciplines where the style of the lecture is more dynamic, and where the lecturer needs to interact with the students, but I don&#x27;t believe this to be the case with STEM subjects.\nGraduate school might be different, but I don&#x27;t know much about that.<p>> But what the school also overlooked is that students with academic problems may not be the best candidates for distance learning. &quot;They need people almost literally holding their hands, watching them do work,&quot; says Newfield, &quot;being there when they get frustrated at the moment when that happens.&quot;<p>No one cares if you fail courses, and no one holds your hand in the University. The professor doesn&#x27;t know you, and he isn&#x27;t going to check up on your progress. \nThe only difference is that you the professor might have office hours where you can ask him questions personally (something not many students do, by the way).",1374904492

I don&#x27;t think anyone here views Matlab as a general-purpose language, even though you can put together some fairly fancy things in it.<p>What we do view Matlab as is an exceptional domain-specific matrix manipulation and data visualization language. The IDE is exceptionally easy to use, and combined with the great graphs/plots makes debugging and iteration very easy. If we need to do something Matlab can&#x27;t, we write it in a different language and use files for IPC. This approach covers 99.9% of everything we do.<p>I get that Matlab is super expensive, and that annoys me too. I&#x27;d love to use it at home, and not struggle instead with terrible development environments(I use SciPy/Matplotlib at home - mostly from an IPython shell - Spyder doesn&#x27;t cut it, even though I wanted it to so much). But my workplace pays real engineers and scientists fairly large sums of money, and doesn&#x27;t bat too much of an eye at paying for productivity tools, the cost of which I feel is the main disadvantage of Matlab.",1374904308

Think about it. This was an online class, with presumably very little (if any!) vetting of the students, with little or no supervision (they didn&#x27;t even know a lot of the kids didn&#x27;t have computers until three weeks in!), and a whole 50% <i>didn&#x27;t</i> fail?

Because imagine if everyone <i>did</i> pass? You would go to your future employer and say, &quot;Yeah, so, I took this course, online, where not a single person failed, and it&#x27;s obvious that I&#x27;m competent, because they have this, ya know, innovative learning algorithm.&quot; If everyone passed than you might as well do MIT OCW.

And not only that, it&#x27;s downright democratic: anyone can take it in the world, and if you <i>are</i> in fact one of the ones that pass, the certification really does mean something. I mean, people put CFA after their name!<p>That&#x27;s the future in online education.

It doesn&#x27;t seem likely that online learning will work better for everyone, but I strongly suspect that it will work better for some subset of people.  In the long run, personalization will be extremely important in education.<p>Have you ever had a great teacher you really engaged with, but also heard from other people that they didn&#x27;t really like the teacher?  For myself, I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;ve found that only about 5% of teachers are actually engaging, with depressingly few of those before college.  Imagine if you had a personal learning profile built up over your education, so that over time you were matched with the best possible (world-class) instructor for your learning style for every class.  I&#x27;d bet most of the people here were near the top of their class; imagine never having to slow down for anyone, and automatically skipping reinforcement you don&#x27;t need, so you can learn and advance as quickly as you are able.  I think some people respond best to coursera style lectures, others respond better to Udacity-style continuous socratic method lessons, while others respond better to group work and discussion.  Why bother trying one-size-fits-all solutions, when technology can allow for direct personalization.  My Netflix experience isn&#x27;t like anyone else&#x27;s, why should my education.<p>I think there is actually a great opportunity to build a platform business in this space, where different instructors can design and build different types of courses.  Imagine 20 different calculus courses, but the student only sees one.  The best lessons are cherry-picked for them, and the curriculum and delivery is tailored to the rate that they are learning.  I&#x27;d really like to build something like that, if anybody else wants to give it a shot, shoot me an email.",1374901998

Ever seen a &#x27;no u-turns&#x27; section in the dead of night with no cars in sight? There&#x27;s plenty of times and places where traffic rules can be safely broken, and there are times when police have to respond in a timely but not urgent manner.<p>For example, frequently with theft, they&#x27;ll take a while to get to the location where it was reported - this is because the one place the criminal is not at is the site of the theft. So they drive around the location for a bit, sirens off so as not to alert the criminal, and see if they find anything suspicious. Then they can come in to do the report after the scout around.<p>If you <i>honestly</i> cannot think of a situation where police need to respond without using sirens or breaking traffic rules, then I would suggest you&#x27;re not close enough to understanding what the job entails to be passing comment on their procedures.",1374901910

A larger percentage of donations have little to do with the individual views and predilections of representatives, and a tremendous amount to do with the committees on which they sit. Not only is there a a precisely defined hierarchy of assignments (ranked according to much money they&#x27;re expected to bring in), but the allocation of these seats is handled to ensure the overall viability of the party. So for instance, a junior representative from a swing district will be assigned to a high-dollar committee, on the assumption that this will give him access to a higher volume of donor funds, and make his seat more defensible. What he thinks, personally, is irrelevant. What he oversees is what matters. And if he squanders the opportunity given to him by his party&#x27;s bosses, he&#x27;ll be kicked out of that seat, and see it handed to a representative who has the motivation and mercenary disposition required to exploit it fully.<p>Some committees have negative value. That is to say, sitting one one signals a lack of influence, making assignment to these Congressional Siberias a real damper in the dialing-for-dollars game that these folks play, if not all day, then at least every day. Interestingly the Science & Technology Committee is one of these. Any actually valuable science and tech (e.g. telecommunications) is handled elsewhere. The grim consolation in seeing total anti-science idiots getting assigned to these committees is that it indicates that even Congress doesn&#x27;t take them seriously.

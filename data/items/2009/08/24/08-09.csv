781757,comment,781561,781737,0,0,patio11,,,"Your friendly neighborhood flag-revering American has a suggestion for you: there are two design elements of note on an American flag.  The first is the color scheme: red, white, and blue.  The second is the motif: stars (generally plural, number mostly unimportant although it is canonically 50) and stripes (generally plural, number mostly unimportant although it is canonically 13).<p>If it doesn't have all three of red, white, and blue or both of stars and stripes, the designer almost certainly wasn't going for an American flag.  For example, the overwhelming majority of Americans would not connect a white star and a blue star paired together as recognizably American.<p>American flag iconography also tends to use wavy lines, for the ""flag fluttering in the breeze"" effect.  Additionally, it overwhelmingly features the flag oriented horizontally with the blue bits in the top left.<p>For a good example of modern American flag iconography, see the Obama O logo (which is, incidentally, probably the best logo I have ever seen in politics or otherwise, and I say that as a Republican).  You don't remember McCain's campaign logo (that's a statement, not a question, <i>nobody</i> remembers it) but it had a Navy Star rather than a flag at its centerpiece.<p>Sorry, I get a kick out of this stuff.

781750,comment,781317,781317,0,0,caffeine,,,"> How is that qualitatively different from training it on all your data<p>It's different for the simple reason that to really verify a hypothesis, you don't just test it on the other half of the same data.  That's just step 1.<p>What you need to do is work out the further implications of your hypothesis, and test <i>those</i>.  When doing so, one of three things will happen:<p>1) You remain an astronaut.  In other words, your work is so far out that none of its implications falsify or corroborate any existing theories, and all require their own experiments. This can be good (i.e. ground-breaking work), but for your hypothesis to become accepted as anything other than an interesting diversion, you will need to wait for the rest of science to catch up, or to keep building out implications until you can connect what you're doing to existing theories.<p>2)  The implications of your hypothesis directly corroborate an existing theory.  This is useful, but a bit boring.  It means you've basically discovered yet another implication of an existing theory.  Experiment some more, and then publish.<p>3) The implications of your hypothesis contradict existing hypotheses or theories.  This is exciting!  This is where the real science lies.  Now you get to design a series of experiments to figure out who is right, who is wrong, and why.  You debug your hypothesis and/or the existing science 'til it works, possibly overturning established wisdom along the way.<p>4) A combination of (2) & (3) occur.  Woah!  This is really exciting.  You've discovered that the implications of one existing theory falsify those of another existing theory, uncovering a fundamental flaw in our understanding so far. Well done!  You've got a lifetime of debugging ahead of you, but your contribution is likely to be truly important.<p>> there is no getting rid of models.<p>True; and models are very useful.  But there's a big difference between models used as an explanatory / predictive tool (i.e. Newtonian physics), and models used as a substitute for Nature when doing experiments (i.e. what's done in Computational Neuroscience, my field).  The latter attempts to duck the issue of doing real experiments that are complicated / expensive by running the experiment on a computer.<p>Now, this is certainly useful - but to be science, it must be accompanied with a solemn understanding that ""What you learn here don't mean jack.""  It's just a model, and probably a bad one.  God doesn't use 64-bit floating points.  The only possible use is to help you design a better experiment to try in the real world.  But if you never get to doing that, then you've wasted everybody's time, because you got stuck on step 0 (Hypothesize).",1251102743

I did it through disciplined meditation on emptiness and compassion in turns, and a sort of retreat from the world, as I had a little money put away and few expenses. It was wonderful for a while. I felt very happy. I literally felt that I'd dismantled everything that I thought I was. I no longer knew what I liked or disliked. It was very difficult to have an opinion about anything. I certainly wasn't hacking. I moved through the world in a sort of wide eyed daze (probably due to over-oxygenation :) It felt like I got maybe a quarter of the way to wherever it was I was going, although I have no way of knowing.<p>But life demands, and I stopped my practice and dove back into it with little thought, and that's when things got bad. I had no drive, no motivations, and didn't have a clue who I was anymore. But I also wasn't meditating, which can serve as preventative medicine against the effects of these things in the ""real world"". I felt kind of clueless and naked, like an amnesiac dumped in the middle of a big city.<p>Well, anyway, long story short, you'd be surprised how powerful these ancient techniques can be, and you'd be wise to seek guidance from someone experienced before you go dismantling yourself all willy-nilly :).

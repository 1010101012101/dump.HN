If Lisp was an infix language, then yes foo-bar would mean something different to the parser than foo - bar because of the whitespace.<p>But whats also at stake is whether that language would be readable to humans without mistakes. Part of what makes Lisp work, IMO, is that you never try to type foo - bar, so you never run into an accident by mistakenly typing foo-bar and having the parser think you meant a hitherto undefined symbol.<p>Whether thats a worthy tradeoff is a matter of opinion, and Ill take Avdis word for it that he believes the benefits of calling symbols foo-bar outweigh the odd time you might type the wrong thing. Im just pointing out in addition to the whitespace is the separator argument you both make, theres also the foo - bar doesnt mean foo subtract bar argument.",1337101116

3977451,comment,3977022,3977022,1,0,mikegerwitz,,,"I have an 8-month old son. I hope he grows up to enjoy physical books rather than eBooks. My reasons are many.<p>1. Most eBooks today are DRM-laden and try to lock you into a specific vendor. Since I'm sure most readers here are well aware of problems with books and DRM, I will leave it at that. (defectivebydesign.org) If you can find DRM-free eBooks, this is not an issue.<p>2. I stare at a computer/device screen all day and he will likely be doing the same by the time he has an opinion on eBooks. I enjoy the feeling and look of actual sunlight or a lamp reflected off of the page. That said, you could get a device with e-ink to solve that issue. The problem then is, if you're a free software user, your choices are limited / you will install another OS on your device, in which case your money is still going to support the proprietary software originally on the device.<p>3. Texture, smell, etc. People call me weird when they see me crack open a new book, complement (or express my disgust at) the quality of the pages and appreciate that new book smell. I appreciate the weight of the book. Books are beautiful things (minus the dead tree part --- that alone is enough reason for some to ditch physical books). You do not get that experience with eBooks.
  - What also of certain childrens' books like pop-up books, or the books with the different textures to feel the fuzzy lion or rough brick? Sure, your books isn't going to animate itself in the sense of a video, but there's an entirely different experience.<p>4. Size. This article mentions it. Any eBook I do read, I do so at my PC. Otherwise, I grow incredibly frustrated. Which leads into my next point:<p>5. Spacial memory. Even if I cannot remember the details of a particular paragraph, I can remember roughly where that paragraph was. I can estimate the location of the page, open up to it and flip around a little until I find it. The argument against that would be the fact that you can search on an eBook --- and yes, that is immensely helpful, to the point where I would I have eBook copies of certain physical books I use for reference. But eBooks destroy that spacial memory --- everything is just on a flat screen. Therefore, it <i>feels</i> different when I read an eBook.
  - This same concept applies to, for example, code. When I develop in vim, I do so across multiple monitors with many splits. I can remember where my code is specially in that sense, per file. However, it does not help me for the <i>contents</i> of the file, as that still requires scrolling within the windows. Therefore, if I am doing a code review, for example, I will print out the code. I can easily reference certain portions and annotate it. I can lay out all the code and look at it as a whole.<p>6. Annotations. I have a writing/drawing tablet. I can annotate documents on my PC and I find it especially useful for doing so. I annotate my books heavily. Heavily. No page goes untouched. If I were ever to lose my book (theft, fire, carelessness, etc), I will have lost countless hours of work and research. ...so what's the problem? Is the annotation format both free and standard? Can I view it on any device without saving it as a PDF/image/etc? Not usually.<p>eBooks are good for certain things. It's great to have both an eBook and a physical copy, so long as it is DRM-free. I just cannot make the switch, partially due to quirky reasons. Perhaps, by the time my son is old enough to have an opinion on the manner, devices will evolve to a point that eliminates many of the above points. Until then, the guy who spends the majority of his day at a PC would rather have a physical book to enjoy.",1337101061

It also makes learning abstract concepts easier, it allows one to reach beyond analytic solutions of equations and to access large amounts of data and automate the handling of said data.<p>If a computer can enhance many aspects of people's lives then they get more utility in having more powerful basic mechanisms of interaction for automating a program's behaviour.

A while back I asked why none of them had started reading on their i-pads or gotten an e-reader. Their answers were pretty interesting.<p>They all mentioned not being able to fully utilize their imagination. On a paperback novel, you have the cover artwork, you have the author's bio, and the back cover art. They said most e-readers don't have these and it takes away from the experience. They also said the feel of a book in their hands is an experience they know and love. Even the simplicity of turning pages is lost. Holding a little tablet, they never knew if they getting close to the end of the story or not. With a paperback, it was easy to visually see and know how close you were to the end of the book - and it felt like more of an accomplishment.<p>I found it pretty enlightening. A lot of simple things people take for granted which can't easily be replaced by a better technology.",1337100426

A lot other people did as well because by mid-2009 the relevant thread on their forum ran to over 75 pages so they had to be completely aware of it. People even put up youtube videos of it in action, which must have been a little tricky to catch because it was completely random.<p>In that thread on the forum some people told how they had managed to get their machines replaced. Sometimes the replaced machines had the defect as well. I never had any luck with my local support as they basically said they couldn't reproduce it so they couldn't replace it.<p>However, at one point a rookie tech left a support manual in pdf form on my machine after I had taken it in for servicing. There was a table in it which listed about a dozen different types of problems and the recommended approach for each. Which type of problem was the only one to have a blank cell where the solution should have been? Flickering or blinking displays.<p>So every time I had some other issue with my MBP, and I had several, I tried to get them to do something about the blinking problem. I finally got a second-tier support person (on the phone) to accept the issue. He said it had happened to his as well and replacing the Airport card (which happened to be the thing that had failed that particular time) had fixed it. This was about two months before the end of my three-year Apple Care period and he said that if that didn't fix it, he would try to get it replaced.<p>Well it didn't, to my utter lack of surprise, but I couldn't manage the hassle of giving up my machine yet again and, anyway, I was used to it so the warranty period expired.<p>About a month later Apple released a firmware update that fixed the blinking.<p>I know there are companies that might support their products after the warranty period and I know there are companies that stonewall but I thought this combination was pure Apple.<p>Completely ignore the problem for three years and then release an update after everyone is out of warranty anyway.",1337099657

Sure we don't learn the hard stuff and our understanding is woefully incomplete. But the analogy would be ""the physics we learn in school"" and ""things like conditionals, sets, graphs, types"".
2. The utility curve of physics is a little different than that of programming. Both contextualize the world and give you richer understandings of it in a similar fashion. However, physics stops solving everyday problems sooner than programming does. I have never whipped out alternative spacetime topologies to solve an everyday problem.

We will deal with developing custom web applications from the ground up. We have very good expertise in the entire Web stack in PHP and Python.
Recently, we made a learning platform for a US client who will be launching the product within a week in India. In the learning platform, teachers can make courses - upload videos to S3, add quizzes, add lessons etc and students can login and take the courses. Various analytics will be collected on the users activities like time watched in a video, quiz performance etc.<p>It was a big project which took us 1.5 months end-to-end from the server part to email framework in SES to S3 management framework. We are happy to see the final result here.<p>I want to ask how to keep getting such kinds of projects - we are not interested in doing a small work of a week or so but a complete solution like we did in this case. I tried Elance but good projects are very less and the hit rate is pretty bad as we have nothing to show there.<p>I am looking to hear from you guys as I am sure many of you must have made successful businesses in this model. Any general ideas / advice will also be most welcome.<p>Thanks.",1337097897

Still, if that person can understand three conflicting ninjarocksuperstars' points of view and see how to reconcile them and build a consensus, it might be the most valuable contribution of anyone on the team that day.<p>One of the problems with managing something like a software project is that it's very hard to measure this effect. If you're in an office where people are interacting regularly, there's usually an easy alternative to measurement: ask everyone who helped them do their job the most lately, and the guy that 75% of your team name is the quiet one who works in the background to keep everything ticking over. If everyone is 100% distributed, that guy might not be contributing at the same level as everyone else, but that's because you're not taking advantage of his skills and your team is weaker for it, which is your mistake and not his.<p>(I try to be consensus guy regardless of coding skill, but I'm not sure how good I am at it.

Sure enough, this study only measures ""public"" activity.  If you're just measuring engagement by how frequently someone posts, I think that's a bit misleading. As cryptoz and RobAtticus alluded to, I rarely post to Facebook, but that doesn't at all say I'm not ""engaged"" through reading my friends updates, viewing photos, checking out articles they read, etc. Just because I'm not outspoken (or even narcissitic, ha) enough to post to Facebook every 5 minutes certainly doesn't mean I'm not engaged with it.<p>What intrigues me more about the article, is the picture of ""waning interest"" in G+. My interest in G+ is certainly fading. I might log in one every week or two, and even then it's the same routine; I'll log in, see that it's still the same ghost town it was last week, and then move on.<p>If I were Google, I'd be much more concerned about keeping people interested in G+, not focusing on how many posts people make or how many millions of people have ""upgraded"" to G+ only to never return.",1337097622
